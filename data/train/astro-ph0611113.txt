    "determination of dynamical masses of spiral galaxies is a decisive step in establishing empirically the clustering scale of dark matter . the cold dark matter model predicts a hierarchy of scales , from a dwarf sub - halo scale of @xmath5 of solar masses up to a galaxy cluster size .",
    "there is a strong evidence from the @xmath6-ray observations of galaxy clusters , and from detecting dark matter with gravitational lensing @xcite for a @xmath7 scale , which is the galaxy cluster scale . at the galactic size scale ( of the order of @xmath8 ) , there are contradictory results .",
    "dark matter was not observed in some elliptical galaxies @xcite . as for the spiral galaxies ,",
    "it was pointed out that the amount of dark matter in the disk of the milky way galaxy near the sun is insignificant @xcite",
    ". moreover , mass estimates of spiral galaxies are model - dependent @xcite .    in the following",
    "we propose an iterative spectral method to reconstruct mass distribution in the spiral galaxies .",
    "the method is based on the thin disk model @xcite which offers the possibility to obtain mass density distribution from the observed rotation curve @xcite . with the iterative spectral method",
    "this reconstruction is unique , provided there is observational data about the hydrogen density in the regions outside of rotation velocity measurements . without such data one can also extrapolate hydrogen measurements by assuming its falloff profile that would be physically acceptable .",
    "one should also take into account the abundance of helium which is proportional to that of hydrogen . in this way",
    "we obtain a complete set of data in the complementary regions of a given galaxy .",
    "complete data are required to eliminate cutoff errors that normally result from cutting - off integration in an integral that relates rotational velocity to disk surface mass density at the radius where measurements of a rotation curve end .",
    "we shall call the radius the cutoff radius and denote it by @xmath9 .    in fact , in early days of galactic research",
    "the thin disk model was applied to infer the galactic masses from the measured rotation curves . however , large errors of measurements of rotational velocities practically made the surface mass density reconstruction impossible @xcite . to avoid uncertainties in the thin disk mass reconstruction it became customary to a priori divide spiral galaxies into three major components : bulge , disk and spherical halo .",
    "then a several parameter fit was made determining the properties of those components .",
    "although this approach is physically appealing , the amount of arbitrariness in such a division is unacceptable . in particular , the most massive component of this construction - the spherical halo - stands on the weakest empirical footing",
    "in this paper we address the problem of determination of masses of spiral galaxies with rotation curves violating the sphericity condition at large radii .",
    "one expects that the disk model should approximate mass distribution in such galaxies better than models assuming a massive spherical halo .",
    "the reconstructed surface mass density found for galaxy ngc 4736 approaches the hydrogen density at the outskirts of the galaxy , the rotation curve is perfectly matched in the measured range , and its continuation is predicted further out into the keplerian regime . thus the disk model performs much better in this case than models including the spherical dark halo .    to see why the assumption of the existence of spherical halo seems to be unjustified for a class of spiral galaxies , we consider as an example the galaxy ngc 4736 .",
    "it was found ( @xcite ) that most of the mass ( @xmath10 ) in this galaxy is concentrated in a spherical dark halo , mainly at larger radii . at these distances surfaces of constant gravitational potential",
    "are almost spherical .",
    "therefore one would expect in this region the rotation curve predicted by the kent s analysis to satisfy the sphericity condition . for a spherically symmetric mass distribution the keplerian mass function , @xmath11 ,",
    "corresponding to rotational velocity @xmath12 , should be a nondecreasing function of the radial distance from the center @xmath13 , that is , @xmath14 the experimental rotation curve of ngc 4736 violates this condition for @xmath15 , see figure [ fig : f1 ] , whereas the best - fitting solution for the rotation curve found by kent satisfies this condition . at large radii",
    "the best - fitting rotational velocity is also greater from the observed by a factor of @xmath16",
    ". the total mass should be therefore @xmath17 rather than @xmath18 as found in @xcite ( at the currently accepted distance @xmath19 to ngc 4736 the mass is even less , @xmath20 ) .",
    "negative sphericity test for spiral galaxy ngc 4736 .",
    "the figure shows experimental rotation curve ( solid line ) and the corresponding keplerian mass function defined by @xmath21 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the keplerian mass function is not increasing at all distances , therefore a massive spherical halo in the approximation of circular orbits is excluded and should be replaced with an extended flattened component . ]    this shows that the mass distribution in the galaxy can not be dominated by a spherical component and that it would be more appropriate to assume more extended disk components in similar galaxies in place of massive spherical halos .",
    "the global disk model has been used recently @xcite , however the procedure of cutting - off integrals applied therein lead to overestimation of surface density at larger radii for galaxies with declining rotation curves .",
    "for example , surface density in the galaxy ngc 4736 could be reliably determined only within a radius of less than @xmath22 .",
    "but the experimental data available for this galaxy enable one to find a much better determination of mass distribution as far as @xmath23 from the center .",
    "an improved approach was presented in @xcite , where rotation curves were assumed keplerian in the unobserved regions .",
    "this procedure is still unsatisfactory , as velocities of test particles on circular orbits encircling a disk - like object need not be keplerian . besides no comparison with the observed mass density has been done .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the last measured value of rotational velocity at cutoff radius @xmath9 .",
    "we define also a dimensionless function @xmath25 for describing rotation curve , where @xmath26 measures distances in units of the cutoff radius ( we work in cylindrical coordinates @xmath27 ) .",
    "below we shall derive equations that are fundamental for the iteration method we present later on .",
    "let the @xmath28 plane represent the galactic disc .",
    "it is assumed that most of galactic mass is concentrated in its vicinity .",
    "a @xmath29-symmetric and cylindrically symmetric vacuum gravitational potential is given by @xmath30 a discontinuity of @xmath31 in the direction normal to the @xmath28 plane is interpreted as a surface mass density @xmath32 of the galactic disk @xmath33 thus @xmath34 is the fourier - bessel transform of @xmath32 @xmath35 modelling of galactic rotation curves usually assumes that orbits of stars are circular and concentric , then @xmath36 , therefore , @xmath37 by substituting ( [ eq : sigmaintegral ] ) to ( [ eq : u2 ] ) one can show that and @xmath38}\\xi^{-1 } , & 0<\\xi < x,\\\\ { \\left[k{\\left(x/\\xi\\right)}-e{\\left(x/\\xi\\right)}\\right]}x^{-1 } , & 0<x<\\xi , \\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the complete elliptic functions are defined by @xmath39 ] @xmath40}{\\mathrm{d}\\chi}\\right ) , \\label{eq : vfromsig}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 stands for the `` principal value integral '' .",
    "the simple pole @xmath42 dominates the logarithmic divergence in @xmath43 , thus the principal value integral is easily tractable numerically and can be calculated with high accuracy .",
    "the inverse of the above integral reads ) is deliberately presented in the form containing only squares of rotational velocity .",
    "much more familiar is its equivalent form given in the @xcite handbook , and therefore commonly used , however it has the deficiency of containing derivatives of @xmath44 which are determined experimentally with very low accuracy . ]",
    "@xmath45}{\\mathrm{d}\\chi}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] unfortunately , this nice formula is not very useful for determining @xmath32 directly from @xmath12 , as the observed rotation curves have naturally a cut - off , and therefore the integration can not be carried out .",
    "for example , the closer @xmath13 is to cutoff radius @xmath9 , the more @xmath32 is underestimated by cutting off the integration at @xmath9 . in order to overcome this unpleasant feature of disk geometry one may use another , complementary set of the experimental data concerning mass distribution at @xmath46 .",
    "a global mass density and the corresponding global rotation curve can be found iteratively that would both satisfy the relations ( [ eq : vfromsig ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmamoja ] ) and be consistent with the observations .",
    "below we shall find a first approximation to @xmath32 directly from the observed part of rotation curve .    a function @xmath47 defined on the unit interval @xmath48 ,",
    "can be expressed in terms of a series of independent functions .",
    "in particular , if @xmath49 is integrable over the interval , a complete set of orthogonal functions on @xmath48 can be constructed from the bessel function @xmath50 @xcite . then @xmath51 the summation",
    "is taken over all consecutive zeros @xmath52 of the bessel function @xmath53 . by multiplying both sides by @xmath54 and integrating over @xmath48",
    ", we find that @xmath55 the amount of information encoded in the enumerable sequence @xmath56 is insufficient for determining the transform @xmath34 which is a continuum of numbers .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 can not be determined accurately from the observed rotation curve alone , even in the region @xmath57 .",
    "however , the elements of the sequence can be still linearly combined to approximate @xmath34 .",
    "note , that every such approximation is equivalent to choosing a particular extrapolation of a rotation curve beyond its cutoff radius .",
    "there are some mathematical subtleties regarding this extrapolation .",
    "let us assume first that we put @xmath58 for @xmath46 and @xmath59 at a single point @xmath60 .",
    "then we can use the representation ( [ eq : vseries ] ) for @xmath61 , and for @xmath62 we set @xmath63 . from the inverse",
    "transform of ( [ eq : u2 ] ) , which reads @xmath64we then obtain a continuous spectrum when @xmath65 , the components under the summation sign are continuous functions of @xmath66 @xmath67 however , for handling the observational data more tractable are discrete spectra .",
    "for instance , by extending formally ( [ eq : vseries ] ) to the region @xmath62 , we get @xmath68 now , the corresponding @xmath69 , calculated from equation ( [ eq : u2 ] ) , can behave quite odd for @xmath62 and become even negative !",
    "nevertheless , both ( [ eq : contin ] ) and ( [ eq : discretespect ] ) , when substituted to ( [ eq : u2 ] ) , lead to the same @xmath69 for any @xmath48 . although the corresponding surface mass densities differ from each other also for @xmath57 , the difference is , in practice , negligible close to the centre . we may therefore accept ( [ eq : discretespect ] ) as a first approximation of @xmath34 . by substituting ( [ eq : discretespect ] ) to ( [ eq : sig_from_hat_sig ] ) we obtain @xmath70 despite that close to @xmath9 equation ( [ eq : sigmaseries ] ) is not a trustworthy approximation ( the sum may become negative ) , it almost perfectly agrees ( usually for @xmath71 ) with the surface densities corresponding to several model rotation curves that were cutting - off at different @xmath9 .      from the above ,",
    "it is evident that the total mass of the galactic disk within the cutoff radius can not be determined from its rotation law only .",
    "however , if additional bounds for the surface mass density are known outside the cutoff radius , one may find a reliable global mass distribution by iterations .    as before we denote by @xmath9 the cutoff radius , to which a rotation curve has been measured .",
    "we denote this part of rotation curve by @xmath72 . the distribution of matter , which extends far beyond the cutoff radius and which is mostly composed of neutral and molecular hydrogen , we denote by @xmath73 .",
    "if such data are not available , one may try to devise a physically plausible profile of baryonic matter outside @xmath9 .    at the very",
    "beginning we define @xmath74 .",
    "we calculate from ( [ eq : sigmaseries ] ) an initial surface density @xmath75 where the corresponding spectral coefficients @xmath76 are calculated from ( [ eq : expanscoeff ] ) ( we put @xmath75 and @xmath76 in place of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively ) .",

    "we begin the first iteration step ( @xmath86 ) which is described below for arbitrary @xmath87 .",

    "afterwards we find the resulting    discrepancy function @xmath91 defined    for @xmath57 .",
    "the function measures an approximation error    in the @xmath88 iteration step and is used also    to determine a correction @xmath92 to the actual    global surface mass density @xmath93 . by substituting    @xmath94 in place of    @xmath69 in equation ( [ eq : expanscoeff ] ) we find spectral    coefficients @xmath95 where now    @xmath78 stands for    @xmath96 .",
    "next we calculate for    @xmath57 the correction @xmath92 from    equation @xmath97 which is analogous to equation    ( [ eq : sigmaseries ] ) .",
    "let @xmath98 be the first value of    @xmath13 where    @xmath99 .",
    "the corrected global surface mass density @xmath100    is found by setting @xmath101    for @xmath102 and @xmath103    for @xmath104 .",
    "now the @xmath105 iteration step follows .",
    "we repeat this procedure until @xmath106 in the @xmath107 iteration becomes acceptably small .",
    "as an example we choose the spiral galaxy ngc 4736 .",
    "its rotation curve excludes the massive spherical halo , therefore the global disk model should better approximate the gravitational field in this galaxy than models assuming such a halo .",
    "there is also the additional information about distribution of hydrogen observed in the remote region of this galaxy , where the rotation curve has not been determined .",
    "this provides the lower bound for the surface density .",
    "no other luminous matter has been observed there .",
    "the amount of hydrogen in this region is comparably small .",
    "its presence allows us to reconstruct the global mass density and predict the rotation curve beyond the presently measured range .",
    "a high resolution rotation curve of the galaxy was adopted from @xcite .",

    "<S> as an example , the method is applied to galaxy ngc 4736 ; its rotation curve does not allow one to employ a model with a massive spherical halo . </S>",
    "<S> we find a global mass distribution in this galaxy ( without non - baryonic dark matter ) that agrees perfectly with the high resolution rotation curve of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this mass distribution is consistent with the @xmath0-band luminosity profile with the mean mass - to - light ratio @xmath1 , and also agrees with the amount of hydrogen observed in the outermost regions of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we predict the total mass of the galaxy to be only @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is very close to the value predicted by the modified gravity models and much less than the currently accepted value of @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 of the mass in a dark matter halo ) . </S>"
