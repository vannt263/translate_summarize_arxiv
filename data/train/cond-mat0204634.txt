    "the scaling behavior of directed percolation is recognized as the paradigmatic example of the critical behavior of several non - equilibrium systems which exhibits a continuous phase transition from an active state to an absorbing non - active state ( see for instance  @xcite ) . the widespread occurrence of such systems in physics , biology , as well as catalytic chemical reactions is reflected by the well known universality hypothesis of janssen and grassberger that models which exhibit a continuous phase transition to a single absorbing state generally belong to the universality class of directed percolation  @xcite .",
    "introducing an additional symmetry the critical behavior differs from directed percolation .",
    "in particular particle conservation leads to a new universality class of absorbing phase transitions with a conserved field as pointed out in  @xcite . in this work the authors introduced two models , the conserved lattice gas ( clg ) as well as a conserved threshold transfer process ( cttp ) .",
    "the latter one is a conserved modification of the threshold transfer process introduced in  @xcite .",
    "both models display a continuous phase transition from an active to an inactive phase .",
    "the density of active sites @xmath0 is the order parameter of the phase transition controlled by the total density of particles @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 if the density exceeds the critical value @xmath3 and zero otherwise . as usual in second order phase transitions the order parameter vanishes algebraically at the transition point . the corresponding order parameter exponent as well as the exponent of the order parameter fluctuations of the clg are determined in  @xcite for various dimensions .",
    "the scaling behavior of the clg model in an external field conjugated to the order parameter was considered recently  @xcite .",
    "the external field is realized by movements of inactive particles which may be activated in this way .",
    "thus the field creates active particles without violating the particle conservation . taking into account this additional scaling field",
    "the order parameter obeys the scaling ansatz @xmath4 with the critical exponents @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the scaling function  @xmath7 , the reduced control parameter @xmath8 , and the external field  @xmath9 . choosing @xmath10 one gets for zero fields @xmath11 , whereas @xmath12 leads at the critical density to @xmath13 . except of the critical point @xmath14",
    "the scaling function @xmath15 is smooth and analytic but it is not universal since it may depend , like the value of @xmath3 , on the details of the considered systems ( here e.g.  the lattice structure , the update scheme , etc . ) .",
    "a universal scaling function @xmath16 can be introduced if one allows non - universal metric factors @xmath17 for the scaling arguments @xmath18 and @xmath9 ( see for instance  @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath19 and the scaling function is normed by the conditions @xmath20 .",
    "then the function @xmath21 is universal , i.e. , similar to the critical exponents @xmath22 is identical for all models which belong to the same universality class . but",
    "the non - universal metric factors differ again between the models and may depend on the lattice structure , the used update scheme etc .",
    "the non - universal metric factors can be easily determined by the scaling behavior of the order parameter at zero field and at the critical density , respectively .",
    "choosing @xmath23 one gets for zero fields ( @xmath24 ) @xmath25 whereas @xmath26 leads at the critical density ( @xmath27 ) to @xmath28    in this work we derive the universal scaling function  @xmath16 of the mean - field solution of the universality class of absorbing phase transitions with a conserved field . in particular",
    "we consider analytically the clg and the cttp with particle hopping to randomly chosen sites on the whole lattice .",
    "this unrestricted particle hopping breaks long range correlations and the scaling behavior is characterized by the mean - field exponents ( see  @xcite ) . neglecting correlations it is possible to derive analytically the order parameter as a function of the control parameter and of the external field .",
    "the obtained universal function is in perfect agreement with recently obtained numerical data of the five and six dimensional clg and cttp in an external field .",
    "we consider the clg model on a chain with @xmath29 sites and periodic boundary conditions . at the beginning one",
    "distributes randomly @xmath30 particles on the system where @xmath1 denotes the particle density .",
    "a particle is called active if at least one of its two neighboring sites is occupied . in the original clg model",
    "active particles jump in the next update step to one of their empty nearest neighbor site , selected at random  @xcite . in the steady state",
    "the system is characterized by the density of active sites @xmath0 which depends on @xmath1 .",

    "the following we derive the universal scaling function @xmath83 of the mean - field solution .",
    "therefore we write the order parameter [ equation([eq : clg_ord_field ] ) ] as a function of the reduced control parameter  @xmath18 and consider the function @xmath84 . since we are interested in the scaling behavior in the vicinity of the critical point we perform the limits @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 with the constraint that @xmath88 and @xmath89 are finite .",

    "the increased number of nearest neighbours in higher dimensions affects the non - universal quantities @xmath3 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 only , but not the critical exponents and the universal scaling function .",
