    "as is well known the lattice formulation of fermions has extra physical particles or breaks the chiral symmetry .",
    "this is unavoidable under a few plausible assumptions @xcite .",
    "several methods have been proposed to deal with this difficulty .",
    "wilson s formulation @xcite , which is one of the most popular schemes , eliminates the unwanted particles with an additional term which vanishes in the naive continuum limit .",
    "however , this formulation sacrifices the chiral symmetry .",
    "an alternative scheme is the staggered fermion formulation proposed by kogut and susskind @xcite .",
    "this scheme preserves the discrete chiral symmetry and in this point the staggered fermion has an advantage over the wilson fermion .",
    "but , the staggered formulation describes a theory with @xmath2 degenerate quark flavours ( @xmath3 components ) in @xmath0 dimensions , while there is no restriction on the flavour number in the wilson formulation .",
    "recently , it has been shown that lattice fermionic actions with the ginsparg - wilson relation @xcite have an exact chiral symmetry and are free from restriction on the flavour number .",
    "but , these actions can not be `` ultralocal '' @xcite , which makes numerical simulations complicated .    in the recent papers @xcite , we proposed a new type of fermionic action on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice .",
    "the action is ultralocal and has discrete chiral symmetry . on the euclidean lattice",
    "the minimal number of fermion components is @xmath1 , which should be compared with @xmath3 of the staggered fermion .",
    "when dynamical fermions are included , the numerical feasibility relies on the reality and positivity of the fermion determinant . in the previous paper @xcite we investigated , analytically and numerically , the fermion determinant of our new action in the @xmath4-dimensional u(1 ) lattice gauge theory .",
    "we showed the reality of our fermion determinant under the condition fixing the global phase of link variables along the temporal direction . by a similar discussion to the u(1 ) gauge group ,",
    "we could also find the reality and the positivity of our fermion determinant in the @xmath4-dimensional su(n ) lattice gauge theory .    in this paper",
    "we analytically show that our fermion determinant with the su(2 ) gauge fields is real and positive in @xmath0 dimensions",
    ". we also comment on the numerical results of the fermion determinant in the @xmath0-dimensional su(3 ) gauge fields , and discuss the effectiveness of our new action for su(2 ) and su(3 ) lattice gauge theories .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite , we proposed a new fermionic action on the euclidean lattice . though the action keeps the discrete chiral symmetry like the staggered fermion action , the fermion field has @xmath1 components in @xmath0 dimensions . in this section",
    "we briefly sketch our formalism for later convenience .",
    "the action can be written with a fermion matrix @xmath5 as @xmath6 where the summation is over lattice points and spinor indices , and our fermion matrix is defined by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the euclidean time evolution operator and @xmath9 is the unit shift operator defined by @xmath10    we require that the propagator has no extra poles and find that @xmath8 has the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ratio of the temporal lattice constant to the spatial one .",
    "the spinor matrices @xmath13 s and @xmath14 s should satisfy the following algebra : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 run from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "the matrix @xmath20 is positive definite for any positive @xmath12 , therefore @xmath13 s and @xmath14 s can be assumed hermitian , @xmath21 the matrices @xmath13 s and @xmath14 s can be expressed by the clifford algebra : @xmath22 in several ways .",
    "one is @xmath23 as was used in the previous paper .",
    "another one is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is @xmath26 the latter is more convenient than the former for later use .",
    "the dimension of the irreducible representation for @xmath27 s is @xmath1 and accordingly @xmath28 has @xmath1 components .",
    "the interaction of the fermion with gauge fields is introduced by replacing the unit shift operators by covariant ones : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the unit vector along the @xmath31th direction , and @xmath32 is a link variable connecting sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the fermion matrix eq.([eq : fermi_mat0 ] ) and the time evolution operator eq.([eq : u_e0 ] ) become @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "in this section we analytically study the determinant of our fermion matrix in su(2 ) gauge fields .    first , in the @xmath4-dimensional case , the complex conjugation of @xmath37 is @xmath38 where we can write @xmath39 since the link variables in @xmath40 are su(2 ) gauge group elements . here",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are real and depend on lattice points and @xmath43 are the pauli - matrices : @xmath44 then we have @xmath45 by the same discussion for other unit shift operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we also have @xmath48 if we can find the matrix @xmath27 such that @xmath49 it is easily shown that @xmath50 for example , we make the following choice : @xmath51 the matrix @xmath27 acting on two components fermi fields defined by @xmath52 satisfies eq.([eq : xy_1 ] ) .",
    "the eq.([eq : t_gast_t ] ) implies that if @xmath53 is some eigenvalue of our fermion matrix @xmath54 , then @xmath55 is an eigenvalue of @xmath56 and thus also of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore eigenvalues of @xmath54 are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs . from the above discussion",
    "we can prove the reality of our fermion determinant for the su(2 ) gauge groups .",
    "next we show its positivity .",
    "we define @xmath57 where @xmath58 is complex - conjugation operator .",
    "we find @xmath59 and from the relation eq.([eq : t_gast_t ] ) we can show @xmath60 = 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : gp_comm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a real eigenvalue @xmath61 of @xmath54 and the eigenvector @xmath62 for this eigenvalue , from eq.([eq : gp_comm ] ) we obtain @xmath63 suppose @xmath64 , then we find @xmath65 which is inconsistent with eq.([eq : gg-1 ] ) , so that @xmath66 is different eigenvector for the same eigenvalue .",
    "therefore the eigenvalues on real axis are degenerate in pairs and the determinant of @xmath54 is positive .",
    "the above proof of the positivity of our fermion determinant for the su(2 ) group can be expanded to higher dimensions .",
    "we can make a fundamental representation for the clifford algebra with @xmath67 elements @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) using direct products of the pauli - matrices : @xmath70 where @xmath16 runs from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "it can be easily checked that @xmath68 s satisfy the relation @xmath71 moreover , we can see that the matrix @xmath72 is real and the matrix @xmath73 is pure imaginary : @xmath74 from the anti - commutation relation , we find the hermite matrix @xmath25 which anti - commutes with all @xmath68 s : @xmath75 clearly , the matrix @xmath25 is hermitian and the square of this matrix is equal to the unit matrix .",
    "thus , we have @xmath76 in @xmath0 dimensions , the relation eq.([eq : xy_1 ] ) is rewritten as follows : @xmath77    then , for the representation of eq.([eq : xygamma2 ] ) , @xmath78 we find @xmath79 since the eigenvalues of @xmath54 always consist of complex conjugate pairs and degenerated ones on real axis , we conclude the determinant of our fermion matrix is positive in su(2 ) gauge fields in any dimensions .",
    "now we show a numerical evidence .",
    "fig.[fig01 ] shows the spectrum of our fermion matrix in a typical background configuration of link variables for su(2 ) gauge group in @xmath80 dimensions .",
    "we find that their distribution is symmetric with respect to the real axis as expected .",
    "similarly in @xmath81 dimensions we can numerically confirm the symmetry with respect to the real axis , and the positivity of the determinant .",
    "in the previous paper @xcite we reported analytical and numerical results on the fermion determinant of our new action in @xmath4 dimensions . in the case of u(1 )",
    "gauge group , we were faced with the problem of convergence in numerical simulations .",
    "the cause of the poorness of the convergence is that the summation of the @xmath82 over arbitrary phase angle @xmath83 is canceled out accidentally .",
    "the element @xmath84 comes from the one sided time difference operator @xmath85 with @xmath86 replaced by @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath88 , where @xmath86 is defined by @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "therefore we must have control of the phase angle @xmath83 in order to get good convergence in the @xmath4-dimensional u(1 ) gauge theory .",
    "in fact we analytically showed that our fermion determinant is real for all configurations and positive for most configurations under the t - condition ( @xmath90 ) , which corresponds to the temporal gauge condition on the infinite lattice , or the gt - condition ( @xmath91 : @xmath92 ) , which is achieved by a gauge transformation on the infinite lattice .",
    "it was also verified numerically . on the other hand we got good convergence without any conditions in @xmath4-dimensional su(n )",
    "case , because the element like @xmath84 does not belong to the su(n ) group .",
    "the above discussion is applicable to higher dimensions to a certain extent . in su(2 ) group our fermion determinant is analytically shown real and positive in any dimensions . in fig.[fig02](a ) we give the numerical evidence that the determinant is real and positive in @xmath80 dimensions . in the case of su(3 ) group , we can not prove the reality of the determinant .",
    "but from fig.[fig02](b ) we see that the distribution of the determinant is concentrated near the real axis without any conditions and the phase angle of the determinant is small .",
    "we have obtained similar results in @xmath81 dimensions .",
    "when the phase angle of the fermion determinant is small enough , we can neglect the phase factor and make use of @xmath93 instead of @xmath94 . in the above numerical simulations link variables",
    "are updated by the metropolis method and determinants are calculated by the lu decomposition .",
    "so there are no systematic errors in the determinants .",
