    "a clear and comprehensive picture describing the physical processes which regulate stellar mass growth in galaxies is still missing in our understanding of galaxy evolution . indeed , the stellar mass growth is regulated by a complex interplay between the radiative cooling of the gas ( e.g. white 1978 ) , cold accretion ( e.g. kere et al . 2005 ) , the spatial redistribution of the gas along the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos ( e.g. springel et al .",
    "2006 ) and the feedback from supernovae and active galaxy nuclei ( e.g. benson et al .",
    "2003 , croton et al .",
    "agn feedback is a central process recently added to galaxy formation models in order to suppress excessive cooling of the gas in massive halos ( e.g. bower et al .",
    "2006 , croton et al .",
    "2006 , menci et al .",
    "2006 , cattaneo et al .",
    "even with the inclusion of agn feedback , semi - analytical models still miss a population of massive galaxies at @xmath16 ( mccracken et al .",
    "2009 ) and overproduce the number density of low mass galaxies ( e.g. kitzbichler & white 2008 , stringer et al . 2008 ) .",
    "therefore , a better description of star formation activity is still needed . the stellar mass function ( mf ) , as studied in this paper , characterizes how star formation activity build the stellar mass of each galaxy type .",
    "merging between galaxies is another central mechanism in stellar mass assembly .",
    "however , there appears to be little consensus between direct estimates of the merger rate ( e.g. le fvre et al .",
    "2000 , kartaltepe et al .",
    "2007 , lotz et al . 2008 ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to study the product of major mergers .",
    "indeed , these are expected to deplete the low mass end of the mf in favor of high - mass galaxies , and to produce galaxies with elliptical morphologies ( e.g. toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "therefore , a detailed measurement of the mf by galaxy type can yield valuable clues on galaxy assembly by mergers .",
    "this measurement can also be considered to be a crucial test of the hierarchical paradigm since the assembly of elliptical galaxies is expected to follow a hierarchical build - up similar to that of their host dark matter halos ( e.g. kauffmann et al . 1993 , de lucia et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "following the stellar mass assembly of a given galaxy population requires that the sample be split into well characterized galaxy types .",
    "a multi - color classification scheme is often the only possible method to split the faint high redshift samples by type .",
    "the bimodal distribution of the galaxies in a color - magnitude diagram is a common tool often used to differentiate two populations : `` blue cloud '' and `` red sequence '' galaxies ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "2004 , faber et al .",
    "2007 , franzetti et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the red sequence galaxies include mostly passive galaxies with an elliptical morphology ( e.g. strateva et al .",
    "2001 , cassata et al .",
    "2007 ) , but also a significant fraction of dust extincted star - forming galaxies ( e.g. william et al . 2008 ) and spi / irr galaxies with a quenched star - formation ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "a novel color - color selection technique ( @xmath17 versus @xmath18 ) has been proposed by william et al .",
    "this color - color selection breaks the degeneracies between dust - extincted star - forming galaxies and those with quenched star - formation .",
    "this diagram is more efficient for detecting a bimodal distribution than a color - magnitude plot ( william et al .",
    "an alternative multi - color classification method is based on a template - fitting procedure ( e.g. lin et al .",
    "1999 , wolf et al .",
    "2003 , zucca et al .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it defines more than two spectral types .",
    "but the different template selections are difficult to compare from one study to another .    however , the spectral classifications are sensitive to the instantaneous star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "different galaxy populations mixed in the same spectral class can be disentangled by adding morphological information .",
    "automatic morphological classifications ( e.g. abraham et al . 1996 ) performed on high resolution images are efficient for discriminating at least two robust classes : e / s0 and spi / irr galaxies ( e.g. lauger et al .",
    "2005 , menanteau et al .",
    "2006 , lotz et al .",
    "2008 , capak et al .",

    "we also found that the mass - to - light ratio increases with the stellar mass .",
    "this trend is expected since the high mass galaxies are older and have a larger mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the right panel of figure [ ml_z ] shows the difference between the observed mass - to - light ratio and the analytical relation derived by arnouts et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . for the quiescent galaxies",
    ", the median difference is below 0.1 dex .",
    "the median difference is also below 0.1 dex for the star - forming galaxies ( @xmath106 ) , but the median difference is shifted below -0.3 dex at low masses @xmath107 , showing that this relation is not anymore a good proxy for the low mass galaxies .",
    "we compared our stellar mass densities for star - forming galaxies with results from the literature in figure [ ld_litt ] .",
    "the stellar mass densities of arnouts et al .",
    "( 2007 ) are systematically 0.2 dex higher than our measurements .",
    "arnouts et al .",
    "( 2007 ) based their measurements on the @xmath49-band lf converted into stellar mass density using the mass - to - light relation discussed above . at low masses ( @xmath108 ) , we found mass - to - light ratio lower by 0.2 - 0.4 dex than those estimated from the arnouts et al .",
    "( 2007 ) relation .",
    "since star - forming galaxies are mostly low / intermediate mass galaxies ( steep slope of their mf ) , the dependency of the mass - to - light ratio on the mass likely explains this offset of 0.2 dex in the stellar mass densities .",
    "two possible sources of incompleteness could affect our estimate of the quiescent mfs at @xmath21 : the depth of the optical catalogue and the confusion in the irac images .",
    "we checked the validity of our selection criteria using the goods datasets ( giavalisco et al .",
    "we used the public catalogues fireworks ( wuyts et al . 2008 ) and music ( santini et al .",
    "the irac photometry in these catalogues is less affected by the confusion since specific softwares allow an accurate `` psf - matching '' ( e.g. convphot in santini et al .",
    "the goods optical data are also deeper than cosmos ( 90% complete in @xmath109 at 26.5 mag ) .",
    "we selected the fireworks and music catalogues at @xmath110 , which is the selection limit of our study .",
    "we computed the photo - z using the code \" le phare  and the same setting ( templates , extinction , ... ) as ilbert et al .",
    "the rest - frame colors and stellar masses were estimated following exactly the method described in section [ method ] .",
    "we also classified galaxies according to their dust - corrected @xmath111 rest - frame colors as in section [ template ] .",
    "first , we find that the contribution of galaxies fainter than @xmath112 is negligible at the considered stellar mass limits ( see table [ schechterred ] ) .",
    "then , we derive the quiescent mass functions in goods ( using both music and fireworks catalogues , as well as their original photo - z ) . the comparison with the s - cosmos mfs is shown in figure [ mfgoods ] .",
    "the results are in excellent agreement .",
    "the differences could be easily explained by cosmic variance since the goods field covers only 160 arcmin@xmath0 .",
    "the only significant difference is seen using the goods - music catalogue and their own set of photo - z at @xmath113 ( a factor @xmath114 in normalisation ) . from this comparison , we conclude that our results do nt suffer from any significant incompleteness at @xmath21 and that the rapid assembly of the quiescent population at @xmath115 ca nt be explained by incompleteness or confusion effects .",
