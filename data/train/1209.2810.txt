    "coloring has been used in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks to improve communications efficiency by scheduling medium access . indeed ,",
    "only nodes that do not interfere can have the same color and then are allowed to transmit simultaneously .",
    "hence coloring can be used to schedule node activity .",
    "the expected benefits of coloring are threefold :    1 .   at the bandwidth level where no bandwidth is lost in collisions , overhearing and",
    "interferences are reduced .",
    "moreover , the use of the same color by several nodes ensures the spatial reuse of the bandwidth @xcite .",
    "2 .   at the energy level",
    "where no energy wasted in collision .",
    "furthermore , nodes can sleep to save energy without loosing messages sent to them because of the node activity schedule based on colors @xcite .",
    "3 .   at the delay level where the end - to - end delays can be optimized by a smart coloring ensuring for instance that any child accesses the medium before its parent in the data gathering tree @xcite .    concerning coloring algorithms , two types of coloring",
    "are distinguished : node coloring and link coloring . with link coloring ,",
    "time slots are assigned per link . only the transmitter and the receiver",
    "are awake , the other nodes can sleep .",
    "if the link is lightly loaded , its slot can be underused .",
    "moreover , broadcast communications are not easy : the source must send a copy to each neighbor . on the contrary , with node coloring , the slot is assigned to the transmitter that can use it according to its needs : unicast and/or broadcast transmissions . hence the slot use is optimized by its owner .",
    "the value of @xmath0 in @xmath0-hop node coloring must be chosen to ensure that any two nodes that are strictly more than @xmath0-hop away can transmit simultaneously without interfering .",
    "it follows that @xmath0 depends on the type of communication that must be supported .",
    "for instance , broadcast transmissions require 2-hop coloring , whereas unicast transmission with immediate acknowledgement ( i.e. the receiver uses the timeslot of the sender to transmit its acknowledgement ) requires 3-hop coloring , see @xcite for an illustrative example .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we define the coloring problem in section  [ problem ] and introduce definitions .",
    "we position our work with regard to the state of the art in section  [ stateart ] . in section  [ complexity ] , we prove that the @xmath0-hop coloring decision problem is np - complete in both general and strategic modes , for any integer @xmath1 .",
    "that is why , we propose serena , an heuristic to color network nodes . in section",
    "[ theoretical ] , we obtain theoretical results determining an optimal periodic color pattern for grid topologies with various transmission ranges .",
    "we compare them with serena results in section  [ serena ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] pointing out future research directions .",
    "let @xmath2 be an undirected graph representing the network topology .",
    "each vertex @xmath3 represents a network node with @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the number of network nodes . for all vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath8 , the edge @xmath9 if and only if the two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 are one - hop neighbors .",
    "there are two types of graph coloring : vertex ( or node ) coloring assigns a color to each vertex of the graph , whereas edge ( or link ) coloring assigns a color to each edge of the graph .    *",
    "one - hop node coloring * of @xmath10 consists in ( i ) assigning each vertex in @xmath8 a color in such a way that two adjacent vertices have different colors and ( ii ) using the smallest number of colors .",
    "we can easily extend one - hop node coloring to @xmath0-hop node coloring , where @xmath0 is an integer strictly positive .",
    "@xmath0-hop node coloring is also called @xmath0-distance node coloring and 1-hop coloring of the power @xmath0 of the graph @xmath10 in @xcite .    for any integer @xmath1 , two nodes @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 are said @xmath0-hop neighbors if and only if the shortest path between them has a length of @xmath0 links .    for any integer @xmath1",
    ", a @xmath0-hop node coloring is said * valid * if and only if any two nodes that are @xmath13-hop neighbors , with @xmath14 have not the same color .",
    "a valid @xmath0-hop node coloring is said * optimal * if and only if no valid @xmath0-hop node coloring uses less colors that this coloring .",
    "it can be easily shown that the breakage of a link does not compromise the validity of a coloring , whereas the creation of a new link may .",
    "+ for simplicity reasons , colors are represented by natural integers , starting with zero .",
    "we can notice that almost all coloring algorithms when applied to a wireless network , make the assumption of an ideal wireless environment .",
    "a wireless environment is said * ideal * if and only if :    * any node has a unique address in the wireless network .",
    "* links are symmetric : if node @xmath11 sees node @xmath12 as a one - hop neighbor , then conversely node @xmath12 sees node @xmath11 as a one - hop neighbor .",
    "* links are stable .",
    "more precisely , link creation during or after the completion of the coloring algorithm is not taken into account . * for any node @xmath11 , any node @xmath15 that is not in transmission range of @xmath11 can not prevent @xmath11 from correctly receiving a message sent by @xmath12 of its one - hop neighbors .",
    "for any node @xmath11 , its 1-hop neighbors are all the nodes located in the disk centered at node @xmath11 of radius the transmission range @xmath16 . for any integer @xmath17 , any two nodes @xmath11 and @xmath12 are @xmath0-hop neighbors if and only if @xmath11 is @xmath18-hop away from a 1-hop node of @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1or2hopnodes ] depicts a node @xmath15 that belongs to the disk centered at node @xmath11 of radius @xmath19 .",

    "two modes are introduced in @xmath0-hop node coloring :    * _ the general mode _ to support general applications , where the destination of any unicast transmission can be any network node .",
    "the general mode is the default mode of the @xmath0-hop node coloring problem defined in section  [ general ] . *",
    "_ the strategic mode _ to support data gathering applications , where the destination of any unicast transmission is either the parent or a child of the node in the data gathering tree .",
    "with regard to the general mode , the strategic mode requires an additional constraint to be met : + [ c0 ] any node must select a color strictly higher than the color taken by its parent in the data gathering tree .    to compare the performance of coloring algorithms ,",
    "two criteria are used :    * the number of colors used : the optimal number is called chromatic number . * the number of rounds needed to color the graph . by definition , in a round , a node is able to send a message to its neighbors , to receive their message and to process them .",
    "we now present a brief state of the art dealing with graph coloring and its application to radio networks and wireless sensor networks .",
    "coloring has been first introduced in graphs with vertex coloring and edge coloring .",
    "one - hop vertex coloring has been shown np - complete in @xcite for the general case , whereas graphs with maximum vertex degree less than four and bipartite graphs can be colored in polynomial time .",
    "the first algorithms proposed were centralized like the greedy algorithm dsatur ( no color backtracking )  @xcite , where the vertex with the highest number of already colored neighbor vertices is colored first .",
    "later on , decentralized ones like distributed largest first @xcite were designed . in this algorithm , each node selects a color .",
    "it is allowed to keep its color only if it has the largest degree among its neighbors but also if this color does not conflict with the colors of its neighbors .",
    "this algorithm runs in o(@xmath26 ) , where @xmath27 is the largest vertex degree and @xmath5 the number of vertices .",
    "the algorithm given in @xcite proceeds iteratively by reducing the number of colors step - by - step ; initially , all nodes have distinct colors .",
    "this algorithm runs in o(@xmath26 ) and uses a number of colors close to @xmath27 .",
    "+ the theoretical performance of coloring algorithms has been studied in the literature , in general for 2-hop coloring . because minimum 2-hop coloring is np - complete ,",
    "the focus has been on evaluating the performance of _ approximation _ algorithms , whose objective is not to find the optimal coloring , but at least to be reasonably close .",
    "a typical approximation algorithm for coloring is _ firstfit _ : _ firstfit _ @xcite sequentially assigns colors to nodes ; it chooses for each node the first available color .",
    "depending of the order in which the nodes are colored , different results ( with varied performance ) are obtained .",
    "+ edge coloring problems can be transformed into a vertex version : an edge coloring of a graph is just a vertex coloring of its link graph . applied to wireless networks ,",
    "edge coloring has been called link scheduling .",
    "for instance ,  @xcite obtains a tdma mac schedule enabling two - way communication between every pair of neighbors .",
    "edges are colored and a feasible direction of transmission is found .",
    "+ coloring has then been applied to radio networks to provide a collision - free medium access .",
    "the goal is to schedule transmissions in time slots , in such a way that two senders allowed to transmit in the same slot do not interfere .",
    "such a problem is also called broadcast scheduling in  @xcite , channel assignment in  @xcite or slot assignment in  @xcite .",
    "trama ,  @xcite , schedules node transmissions by assigning time slots to transmitting nodes and receivers . only nodes having data to send contend for a slot .",
    "the node with the highest priority in its neighborhood up to 2-hop wins the right to transmit in the slot considered .",
    "each node declares in advance its next schedule containing the list of its slots and for each slot its receiver(s ) .",
    "the adaptivity of trama to the traffic rate comes at a price : its complexity .",
    "drand ,  @xcite , the coloring algorithm used with the hybrid zmac protocol , @xcite , that operates like csma under low contention and like tdma otherwise , assigns slots to nodes in such a way that 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors have different slots .",
    "this randomized algorithm has the advantage of not depending on the number of nodes but at the cost of an asymptotic convergence . + more recently , coloring algorithms have been designed for wsns , like flama  @xcite , an adaptation of trama , where its overhead has been considerably reduced .",
    "this is obtained by supporting communications limited to the data gathering tree , like tdma - asap .",
    "tdma - asap @xcite integrates a coloring algorithm with the medium access .",
    "moreover , this protocol can adapt to various traffic conditions by allowing a node to steal an unused slot to its brother in the tree . in wsns where energy matters , sensors receive consecutive time slots , like  @xcite , to reduce the frequency of state transitions and thus save energy .",
    "flexitp  @xcite is a tdma - based protocol in which a slot is assigned to one transmitter and one receiver .",
    "the slot assignment order is given by a deep - first search of the tree .",
    "a node selects the smallest available slot in its neighborhood up to 2 hops and advertises its schedule .",
    "this solution does not support immediate acknowledgment . in @xcite , we proposed serena a node coloring algorithm that increases energy efficiency by avoiding collisions , reducing overhearing , allowing nodes to sleep to save energy and enabling spatial reuse of the bandwidth .",
    "this algorithm can support various types of communication ( unicast with immediate acknowledgement , broadcast ) .",
    "it can also be optimized for data gathering applications by scheduling the children before their parent .",
    "notice that serena is a practical distributed protocol that implements an efficient version of the algorithm _",
    "firstfit _ for a @xmath28-hop coloring , with a specific order induced by node priority . in this paper",
    ", we give new theoretical results for grid coloring .",
    "finally , we show how serena can be optimized .",
    "in this section , we will demonstrate that @xmath0-hop ( @xmath29 ) vertex coloring in both general and strategic modes is a np - complete problem .",
    "this assertion is given by theorem  [ thcomplexity ] :    [ thcomplexity ] the decision problem of @xmath0-hop ( h@xmath301 ) vertex coloring in both general and strategic modes is np - complete .",
    "+    it has been proved in  @xcite that the 1-hop vertex coloring problem is np - complete .",
    "we now prove the np - completeness in both general and strategic modes for @xmath31 .",
    "our proof of theorem  [ thcomplexity ] is based on the following steps : + @xmath32 first , we define the associated decision problem of the @xmath0-hop vertex coloring of a graph @xmath10 in both general and strategic modes : can graph @xmath10 be colored with @xmath13 colors in both general and strategic modes ( @xmath13 is a positive integer smaller than the vertex number ) , such that two nodes that are @xmath33-hop neighbors with @xmath34 have not the same color ?",

    "@xmath32 third , we define a reduction @xmath40 of the @xmath13-color 1-hop vertex coloring problem that has been shown np - complete in  @xcite , to a @xmath41-color @xmath0-hop coloring problem in both general and strategic modes , with @xmath41 a positive integer smaller than the nodes number",

    "+ finding a valid @xmath41-color @xmath0-hop coloring of @xmath43 in both general and strategic modes based on a valid @xmath13-color 1-hop coloring of @xmath2 requires that for any two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath10 , the following constraints are met :    [ c1 ] any two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 , 1-hop away in @xmath10 must be at most @xmath0-hop away in @xmath44 .",
