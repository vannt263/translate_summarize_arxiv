    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that gaussian sum - rules can also be used predictively in hadronic physics , and to develop techniques for the analysis of gaussian sum - rules in hadronic physics .",
    "section [ concept_sec ] reviews the formulation and conceptual advantages of gaussian sum - rules , and develops techniques for analyzing a single - resonance plus continuum phenomenological model .",
    "section [ rho_sec ] applies these techniques to the @xmath0 meson which has traditionally been used to establish the validity of sum - rule techniques .",
    "finally in section [ scalar_sec ] we study the phenomenologically challenging case of the quark scalar mesons probed through the non - strange @xmath1 current .",
    "the scalar sector requires an extension of the analysis techniques to a two - resonance phenomenological model , and development of criteria to determine when such an extension is necessary .",
    "this sensitivity of the gaussian sum - rule to excited states is one of the unique features of the gaussian sum - rule compared with laplace sum - rules .",
    "the phenomenological implications of the results of the gaussian sum - rule analysis of the @xmath1 quark scalar mesons will be presented at the end of section [ scalar_sec ] .",
    "consider the basic form of the gaussian sum - rule . leaving aside the method for calculating @xmath7 , consider the @xmath14 limit of the sum - rule .",
    "using the identity @xmath15 we see that @xmath16 since @xmath5 is related to hadronic physics quantities , the @xmath14 limit of the gaussian sum - rule would in principle allow direct extraction of hadronic physics from the @xmath17 dependence of @xmath18 obtained from qcd .",
    "although the above limit can not be achieved in practice , the property demonstrates an important conceptual advantage of the gaussian sum - rule .",
    "consider the equivalent form of the laplace sum - rule @xmath19 the @xmath20 limit ( again not possible to achieve in practice ) would in principle only emphasize the @xmath21 region of the integration region , and would not reveal the energy dependence of @xmath5 .    now consider a more realistic case of a gaussian sum - rule with @xmath22 .",
    "the gaussian kernel is peaked at @xmath23 , and has a width of @xmath24 .",
    "thus @xmath18 represents a smearing of @xmath5 in the region @xmath25 , centered at @xmath23 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to hope that with @xmath10 fixed at a reasonable physical value , the @xmath17 dependence of @xmath26 will reveal the rough structure of @xmath5 .",
    "for example , if @xmath27 corresponds to a sharp resonance peak of @xmath5 , then one would also expect a peak in @xmath18 near @xmath28 .",
    "these expectations are upheld by the analysis of the @xmath0 and scalar quark mesons in subsequent sections .",
    "the concept of quark - hadron duality , where averaged hadronic quantities are equivalent to the qcd prediction , is explicitly manifested in the parameter @xmath10 which controls the size of the region near @xmath23 over which hadronic physics is averaged . as will be discussed below , @xmath10 is directly related to the energy scale for running quantities in the renormalization - group improvement of the theoretical prediction @xmath18 , and no constraint on",
    "the parameter @xmath17 emerges .",
    "the limitations of qcd originating from the renormalization scale then provide a natural duality interval for reasonable agreement between hadronic physics and qcd .",
    "finally , we shall see that nonperturbative contributions to @xmath26 are suppressed with increasing @xmath17 , explicitly reinforcing the importance of non - perturbative effects in the low - energy region .",
    "the above aspects of the relation between qcd and hadronic physics illuminated by gaussian sum - rules are obscured in the laplace sum - rules .",
    "the reason for this contrast is that the laplace kernel @xmath29 exponentially suppresses the entire energy region of @xmath5 , while the gaussian kernel only damps the energy region of @xmath5 away from @xmath23 .",
    "thus the two scales @xmath17 and @xmath10 in the gaussian sum - rule provide a more detailed probe of hadronic physics than the laplace sum - rule .",
    "extraction of hadronic properties from the theoretical prediction @xmath18 requires a phenomenological model for @xmath5 .",

    "thus since the quantity @xmath38 is constrained by the finite - energy sum - rule , the normalization of the quantity @xmath42 is already determined .",
    "consequently , the information in the sum - rule remaining after imposing the heat - evolution test @xcite is contained in the quantity @xmath43 normalized to unit area @xmath44 leading to a sum - rule independent of the resonance - strength and finite - energy sum - rule .",

    "these properties will be used to find the optimum value of @xmath11 from which @xmath47 can be extracted .",
    "this optimum value of @xmath11 can then be used to determine the total resonance strength through the finite - energy sum - rule .",
    "the analysis proceeds by fixing @xmath10 , and finding the value @xmath48 at which @xmath49 has a maximum ] @xmath50 and then determining the peak height @xmath51 the optimum value of @xmath11 is constrained by the requirements following from the properties of the phenomenological side of :    1 .",

    "the deviation from the narrow width limit is less than 5% for @xmath64 , a condition which is easily satisfied for even a wide resonance such as the @xmath65 in the @xmath66 range .",
    "such uncertainties are well below those associated with the theoretical prediction of @xmath18 . for the @xmath0 meson ,",
    "the resonance width is a completely negligible 0.2% effect even for @xmath67 .",
    "thus we conclude that for reasonable ranges of the the gaussian width @xmath10 , the gaussian sum - rule is insensitive to the effect of resonance widths , and so the narrow width phenomenological model is in fact an accurate description of non - zero width resonances in the gaussian sum - rules",
