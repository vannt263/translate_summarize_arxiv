    "the most common inflation model ( the single scalar field , slow - roll inflation ) predicts the primordial perturbations to be approximately described by the gaussian statistics",
    ". detections of non - gaussianity can discriminate between different inflation models , so the study of various cosmological probes of primordial non - gaussianity has attracted much recent attention .",
    "for example , the cmb has been used to constrain non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "in addition , various aspects of large scale structure have also been examined as probes of non - gaussianity .",
    "these include halo abundances and bias @xcite ; higher order effects on the galaxy power spectrum @xcite ; and the galaxy bispectrum @xcite . and , @xcite has discussed how to optimize the constraint on @xmath0 by applying weightings on subsamples from a single tracer .",
    "recently , @xcite used n - body simulations to study the effect of primordial non - gaussianity on the nonlinear probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the dark matter field .",
    "they found that departures from the gaussian prediction are strongest in underdense regions and on small scales .",
    "the main goal of the present study is to provide some analytic understanding of their results .",
    "we do this by studying the nonlinear evolution of the dark matter pdf .",
    "when the initial conditions are gaussian , then the nonlinear evolution can be modelled by the spherical and ellipsoidal collapse models @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the evolution of the pdf depends on two ingredients : a model for the dynamical evolution from an initial state to a final one , and the appropriate average over the initial states .",
    "in particular , the spherical and ellipsoidal collapse models approximate the nonlinear dynamics as 1@xmath11 or 3@xmath11 mappings from the initial to the final state that do not depend on the gaussianity of the initial conditions .",
    "primordial non - gaussianity enters only because it determines the initial set of states . as a result ,",
    "essentially all of the machinery developed for the gaussian case can be simply carried over to the present study .",
    "we recap the definitions of the local non - gaussian @xmath0 model in section  [ section : nosmooth ] .",
    "the effect of smoothing the initial distribution is described in section  [ section : initc ] .",
    "section  [ section : nlpdf ] describes the nonlinear pdf associated with the spherical evolution model and compares the results with the gaussian case .",
    "section  [ section : sims ] compares our predictions with measurements in simulations .",
    "we summarise our results in section  [ section : discussion ] .",
    "in the @xmath0 models of current interest , the initial density fluctuation field is only mildly perturbed from the gaussian .",
    "therefore , following @xcite and @xcite , we use the edgeworth expansion as a convenient way to summarize our results . because we are interested in mass scales which are substantially larger than that of a single collapsed halo ",
    "the regimes studied by @xcite and @xcite  we are certainly in the regime where the edgeworth expansion is a useful approximation .      the primordial perturbation potential @xmath2 of the local non - gaussian field is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a gaussian potential field and @xmath0 is a scalar .",
    "we will use @xmath5 to represent the power spectrum of @xmath4 ; in what follows we will set @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a normalization constant that is fixed by requiring that the rms fluctuations in the associated non - gaussian initial density field ( which we will define shortly ) have value @xmath9 .",
    "we define @xmath10 as the real , symmetric @xmath11 tensor whose components are proportional to the second order derivatives of the potential @xmath2 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we will sometimes refer to @xmath10 as the shear or deformation tensor associated with the potential @xmath2 .",
    "correlations between the @xmath15 will be very useful in what follows .",
    "these depend on the correlations between @xmath4 and its derivatives .",
    "however , because @xmath4 is gaussian , they can be computed easily .",
    "specifically , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dirac delta function , and we have defined @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the cdm transfer function .",
    "( strictly speaking , we are currently interested in the limit in which @xmath21 .",

    "most of the complication in @xmath0 models arises from the fact that the effect of smoothing is non - trivial .",
    "this nontriviality is a consequence of the fact that a smoothed gaussian field is itself gaussian , but this self - similarity does not hold for generic random fields .",
    "we now calculate the distribution function of the initial overdensity @xmath24 smoothed on scale @xmath26 in the @xmath0 model .",
    "our goal is to approximate this initial pdf using the edgeworth expansion : @xmath27\\ { \\rm d}\\nu(r ) , \\label{eqn : pdfdeltal}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "to second order in @xmath0 , the variance @xmath40 is the sum of two terms ; one is the same as for the gaussian , and the second , which is proportional to @xmath41 , involves a convolution of the power spectrum @xmath42 with itself .",

    "this renormalization is just a few percent effect , but the procedure is essential for removing the singularities .",

    "this means that @xmath55 on the scales of interest in this paper , justifying our use of the edgeworth expansion .",
    "in addition , note that if @xmath56 were independent of @xmath26 , then the edgeworth expansion would be a function of @xmath57 only . in this case , the initial ( non - gaussian ) pdf would be scale - independent , in the sense that the pdf would have the same functional form for all smoothing scales , just as it does for the gaussian . over a sufficiently narrow range of scales , this is a reasonable approximation .      the previous section showed how to calculate the distribution of the initial overdensity @xmath24 .",
    "nonlinear evolution changes this distributions ; this section shows how to estimate the evolved , nonlinear pdf of the overdensity . as noted in the introduction , this can be done by following the same steps as in lam & sheth ( 2008 ) , but with the non - gaussian initial distributions . for brevity , we show results for the spherical evolution model only .    in the spherical model ,",
    "the nonlinear overdensity in a region of volume @xmath25 containing mass @xmath58 is solely determined by the linear overdensity @xmath24 through a @xmath59 mapping : @xmath60 @xcite , where @xmath61 and the exact value depends weakly on the cosmology . in this study we will use @xmath62 which corresponds to the @xmath63cdm cosmology . the pdf of the nonlinear overdensity in a volume @xmath25 associated with spherical collapse is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the initial pdf of @xmath24 at a given smoothing scale @xmath66 .",

    "the pdf measured in simulations can be affected by discreteness effects , especially in small underdense cells .",

    "our results provide further motivation for studying underdense regions .",
    "we are in the process of developing a more complete model of voids and void shapes ( following * ? ? ?",
    "finally , note that the parameter which describes the non - gaussianity in the smoothed initial and final fields , @xmath111 , is only weakly scale - dependent .",
    "therefore , our analysis indicates that the non - gaussian distribution of the resulting nonlinear pdf ( equation  [ eqn : pdfsph ] ) can be written in terms of the scaled variable @xmath112 .",
