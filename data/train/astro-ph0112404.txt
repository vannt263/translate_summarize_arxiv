    "the `` evil eye '' galaxy ( ngc4826 ; m64 ) is a relatively isolated , nearby sab galaxy , located at ra(b1950.0 ) @xmath12 and dec(b1950.0 ) @xmath13 , according to de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1991 - rc3 ) .",
    "its distance from us is uncertain by a factor of 2 : e.g. rubin ( 1994 ) uses a rounded 5 mpc distance , as a compromise between the quoted low and high distances ( braun , walterbos & kennicutt 1992 ; tully 1988 ; kraan - korteweg & tammann 1980 ) .",
    "hereafter we adopt the distance quoted by rubin .",
    "ngc4826 has an optical size of @xmath14 ( rc3 ) and position angle of the line of nodes ( pa for short ) of @xmath15 , on the basis of the outer contours on the poss ( nilson 1973 ; see also rubin 1994 ) . according to the latter author ,",
    "the red isophotal diameters imply an inclination of @xmath16 .",
    "we refer the reader to rubin ( 1994 ) for further details about morphology and geometry of the evil eye galaxy .",
    "ngc4826 owes its surname to the presence of an outstanding , absorbing dust lane ( the evil eye ) , asymmetrically placed across its prominent bulge .",
    "the central region of ngc4826 shows a further peculiarity , since it is associated with several hii regions ( j. young 2000 , private communication ; see also keel 1983a ; rubin 1994 ) . at the evil eye , nicmos imaging in the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) line , obtained by bker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , reveals the presence of an inner arc - shaped region of ongoing star formation activity and of a broad lane of widely distributed , bright hii regions as well , in agreement with the morphology of the @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) line emission ( j. young 2000 , private communication ; see also keel 1983a ; rubin 1994 ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies ( e.g. keel 1983b ; alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2000 ) classify this galaxy as a starburst - powered liner .",
    "sakamoto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) imaged the central region of ngc4826 in the @xmath21 line at the nobeyama millimeter array , with a @xmath22 synthesized beam and an @xmath23 channel width .",
    "they find that the average hydrogen column density of the molecular clouds at the evil eye is about @xmath24 , 2 times larger than on the opposite side of the nucleus , by adopting the conventional co - to-@xmath25 conversion factor @xmath26 , determined in the galactic disk ( scoville et al .",
    "1987 ; solomon et al . 1987 ; strong et al .",
    "this average hydrogen column density produces a v - band ( @xmath27 ) extinction of @xmath28  21 mag , if the dust is uniformly distributed and a galactic dust - to - gas ratio is assumed , but the net asymmetry in extinction , @xmath29 , due to the excess gas in the evil eye , is only of about 3  10 mag ( sakamoto et al .",
    "1999 ) . as noted by the latter authors , significant deviations of the co - to-@xmath25 conversion factor from the standard value ( e.g. wilson & scoville 1990 )",
    "do exist within our galaxy and in different starburst galaxies , nuclei of galaxies and low - metallicity galaxies ( e.g. maloney & black 1988 ; nakai & kuno 1995 ; israel 1997 ) .",
    "a value of @xmath30 , derived by digel , hunter & mukherjee ( 1995 ) in orion , sounds more reasonable to us in the case of the dust lane of ngc4826 , given the presence of several hii regions there . in this case , the co measurement of sakamoto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) gives @xmath31  3.5 mag .",
    "sakamoto et al . also find that the velocity field is quite ordinary with a hint of noncircular motions at the radius of four co clumps , three of the clumps being associated with the dust lane . by contrast , two nested counterrotating hi gas disks , at 1 kpc and in the outer region of the stellar disk , have been discovered in this galaxy ( braun , walterbos & kennicutt 1992 ; rix et al .",
    "1995 ) . as quoted by sakamoto et al .",
    ", the quiescent velocity field suggests that the evil eye does not have much effect on the gas kinematics in the central kiloparsec ( i.e. the central 50 arcsec , assuming the distance of 4.1 mpc adopted by these authors ) .",
    "co line profiles are single - peaked in the evil eye , suggesting to sakamoto et al .",
    "that most of the molecular gas in the dark lane has already settled in the disk even if the gas accreted from outside .",
    "this conclusion is at variance with that of block et al .",
    "the latter authors imaged ngc4826 in the v - band and @xmath32-band ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the presence of the evil eye produces a striking asymmetry in the v - band surface brightness profile , the axial symmetry being restored at @xmath34 . from the analysis of these surface brightness profiles , oriented through the galaxy s center but sequentially spaced 10 degrees each in position angle , block et al . determined a least - squares fit value of @xmath35 for the evil eye , by assuming axial symmetry for both the unobscured v - band surface brightness profile and the unreddened @xmath36 color profile .",
    "the multiple - scattering radiative transfer models of witt , thronson & capuano ( 1992 ) allowed block et al . to identify this value with the geometry of a foreground dusty screen with an average v - band optical depth @xmath37 .",
    "the latter value is equivalent to @xmath38 mag , consistent with our previous estimate .",
    "finally , in the analysis of block et al . , the screen model was also supported by the value of the far - ir - to - optical luminosity ratio of ngc4826 and by the agreement between computed and measured ( molecular@xmath39atomic ) hydrogen column density .",
    "on the basis of the previous arguments , it is reasonable to assume that a moderate amount of gas and dust distributed in a foreground screen is responsible both for the observed amount of attenuation and for the absence of a remarkable kinematic signature in the velocity field at the dust lane of ngc4826 . in our opinion , this scenario is supported by the relative weakness of the average co surface density in the evil eye ( sakamoto et al .",
    "1999 ) , compared to the high optical opacity there ( block et al .",
    "in fact , a screen geometry associated with a homogeneous dust distribution ( like in models of witt , thronson & capuano 1992 ) gives a lower limit to the computed mass of the dust responsible for a given ( observed ) reddening ( e.g. witt , thronson & capuano 1992 ) .",
    "the clumpy structure of the dust is manifested by the presence of dark filaments in the nicmos image of ngc4826 in the @xmath17 line ( bker et al .",
    "this confirms previous suggestions on the nature of the gaps present in the distribution of the @xmath19 emission from several hii regions at the dust lane ( j. young 2000 , private communication ; keel 1983a ; rubin 1994 ) .",
    "this wealth of information makes ngc4826 a suitable test for radiative transfer models .",
    "the strong effect of a homogeneous vs. clumpy dust distribution in different star / dust geometries has been highlighted and carefully investigated recently by the new multiple - scattering radiative transfer models of witt & gordon ( 2000  hereafter referred to as wg00 ) .",
    "wg00 have computed the fractions of escaping / scattered radiation in the 1000  30000 @xmath40 spectral range from three representative types of galactic environments , filled with either homogeneous or two - phase clumpy dust distributions .",
    "furthermore , they considered two types of interstellar dust , similar to those found in the average diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky way ( mw ) and in the bar of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) . for",
    "a given optical depth of the model , absolute estimates of the escaping radiation require the knowledge of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the intrinsic ( i.e. non attenuated ) interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , e.g. through the comparison between data and calculations of stellar population synthesis models . in the case of ngc4826",
    ", low - resolution spectroscopy of the central region , with a slit encompassing equally extended regions on the obscured and unobscured side of the nucleus , provides to first order an observational determination of the intrinsic stellar sed in the dust lane , by assuming axial symmetry for the isrf before dust absorption and scattering ( cf .",
    "block et al .",
    "1994 ) . as a consequence",
    ", it also provides a measurement of the attenuation of the intrinsic isrf in the evil eye .",
    "a least - squares fit of the computed fractions of transmitted and scattered radiation at several different wavelengths to the ratio of the observed and intrinsic seds , for a given position across the dust lane , identifies the corresponding optical depth .    as a further goal , we want to search for a residual dust emission feature , which manifests itself in the familiar broad 0.7 @xmath41 band , known as extended red emission ( ere ) .",
    "broad - band ( @xmath42 ) ere , with a peak intensity wavelength @xmath43 between 0.65 and 0.88 @xmath44 , has been reported in many different dusty astrophysical environments of our galaxy , e.g. the diffuse ism ( gordon , witt , & friedmann 1998 ) , cirrus clouds ( szomoru & guhathakurta 1998 ) , reflection nebulae ( witt & boroson 1990 ) , planetary nebulae ( furton & witt 1990 , 1992 ) , the orion nebula ( perrin & sivan 1992 ) and the high-@xmath45 dark nebula lynds 1780 ( chlewicki & laureijs 1987 ; mattila 1979 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to e.g. witt , gordon & furton ( 1998 ) for a review of the observed properties of ere . here",
    ", it is sufficient to say that the ere is commonly interpreted as a photoluminescence phenomenon originating in dusty environments illuminated by uv / optical photons .",
    "identifying ere in ngc4826 would extend our current knowledge of ere to galaxies different from our own , so far limited to the halo of the starburst galaxy m82 ( perrin , darbon , & sivan 1995 ) and the 30-doradus hii region in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc  darbon , perrin & sivan 1998 ) , but also provide the theory of the ere carrier ( witt , gordon & furton 1998 and references therein ) and photophysics ( smith & witt 2001 ) with a further bench - mark .",

    "conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "the observation of ngc4826 was performed with the cryogenic camera , the low - resolution ( @xmath46 ) ccd spectrometer in use at the mayall 4-meter telescope of the kpno , on the photometric night of 1 february 1994 .",
    "the camera system used a lens collimator , the 780 - 2 grism ( 300 g / mm ; 1st order ; 4900  9700 @xmath40 spectral range ; @xmath0/pixel ) and an f/1 classical schmidt camera with a ford / loral @xmath47 chip with @xmath48 pixels and a 0.84 arcsec / pixel scale .",
    "this chip is sensitive over the 4000  10000 @xmath40 spectral region , has a readout noise of @xmath49 15  18 electrons rms , a full - well of 200000 electrons and a gain of 1.5 electrons per adu .",
    "its quantum efficiency peaks at @xmath50% at @xmath51 . the overall system efficiency ,",
    "including the atmosphere , telescope and instrument , peaks at about 20% .",
    "the camera system was operated in the long - slit mode , with a slit width of 2.5 arcsec , resulting in a 4650  @xmath52 spectral range , with a resolution of @xmath53 ( full - width at half - maximum ",
    "fwhm ) , as measured from sky lines . at the distance of 5 mpc quoted by rubin ( 1994 ) for ngc4826",
    ", the slit width comprises a metric distance equal to 60.6 pc .",
    "the slit was positioned across the galaxy s nucleus , at a position angle of @xmath54 , @xmath55 eastward from north with respect to the pa of the minor axis of ngc 4826 ( cf .",
    "1 ) . with its 4.4 arcmin length ,",
    "the slit encompassed the galaxy s bulge size and equal galactocentric distances were covered on the obscured and unobscured side of the galaxy . a pictorial representation of the region of ngc4826 intercepted by the spectrograph slit under investigation is given in fig . 1",
    ", isophotal contours of the galaxy emission in the @xmath19 line ( j. young 2000 , private communication ) are superposed onto a grey - scale two - dimensional representation of the galaxy v - band surface brightness distribution ( r. evans 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "a cross marks the position of the galaxy center adopted by us , i.e. ra(b1950.0 ) @xmath56 and dec(b1950.0 ) @xmath57 .",
    "five 900 s exposures of ngc4826 were taken at an average air - mass of 1.07 , for a total integration time of 4500 s. one 80 s exposure of the spectrophotometric standard star feige 34 was obtained at an average air - mass of 1.02 , with the same optical set - up used for the galaxy , to enable absolute flux calibration .",
    "finally , one 10 s exposure and one 5 s exposure of a comparison henear arc were obtained , with the same optical set - up used for ngc4826 , to enable absolute wavelength calibration of the galaxy and standard spectra , respectively .",
    "data reduction was performed in the iraf environment and relied on the noao slit - spectroscopy packages .",
    "all the exposures were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded and flipped , in order to have wavelengths increasing from left to right along the ccd rows .",
    "the 5 single exposures of ngc4826 were combined successively with a median filter .",
    "correction of the exposures of the target and of the standard for geometrical distortions in the spatial axis ( along ccd columns ) was performed through two - dimensional mapping of the wavelength in the raw spectrum of each associated comparison arc , assumed as the calibration image .",
    "this procedure enabled both the linearization of the raw spectra in the wavelength direction ( i.e. along ccd rows ) and their absolute calibration in wavelength , with an uncertainty of @xmath58 .",
    "the almost similarly wavelength - calibrated raw spectra of ngc4826 and of feige 34 were furthermore transformed into the same absolute wavelength scale , covering the 4650  9710 @xmath40 spectral range .",
    "it was not possible to correct for the systematic increase of the skew of the line profiles in the lower half of the chip , which results from some misfunction in the optical set - up of the system .",
    "both the resultant raw spectra of ngc4826 and of feige 34 were affected by non - linear tilts in the spatial direction .",
    "these tilts turned highly non - linear in two regions of the chip , defined approximately by the first and last 150 columns .",
    "any spectrum requires a correction for its tilt in the spatial direction before extraction , of course .",
    "this procedure requires the mapping of the maximum intensity at any given wavelength along the spatial axis .",
    "the case of ngc4826 is particularly complex , since the inner region of this galaxy showed a strongly asymmetric radial intensity profile at any wavelength in the 4650  9710 @xmath40 spectral range , as a consequence of the presence of the dust lane ( cf .",
    "block et al .",
    "1994 ; witt et al .",
    "by contrast , the case of feige 34 is simple , since its radial intensity profile is axially symmetric , by definition .",
    "the tilts of the two raw spectra were found to be identical , when allowing for a slight average displacement between the intensity peaks of each object at any given wavelength , along the spatial direction .",
    "a careful investigation of the variation of the displacement between the traces of the two raw spectra at individual wavelengths excluded the presence of any trend with wavelength .",
    "however , it also revealed a systematic increase ( by a maximum factor of 2 ) of the fwhm of the spatial profiles of the target and of the standard toward the short- and long - wavelength ends of the chip . in addition to this increase , at random wavelengths within the short- and long - wavelength ends of the spectrum , the central portion of the intensity profile of each object shows an irregular shape , with peak - to - peak variations within @xmath59 of the rms readout noise .",
    "this irregular shape was already present in the raw spectra before their linearization in the wavelength direction .",
    "it was more pronounced in the spectral regions where the signal - to - noise ratio was lower than 10 , associated with a particularly poor overall system efficiency .",
    "the broadening of the fwhm of the spatial profile in these two spectral regions reduced the maximum value of the observed intensity and the difference between the observed peak intensity and the intensities at neighboring positions .",
    "this effect , coupled to photon plus readout noise , produced the random disappearence of a single , well - defined peak of the observed intensity profiles of ngc4826 and feige 34 at the short- and long - wavelength ends of their spectra . reproducing the trace in these two bad regions of the chip required very high order legendre polynomials , with the result that spurious features were introduced in the extracted spectrum of the star .",
    "this result led us to the decision of deleting the regions of baselines 1  150 and 1050  1200 pixels ( equivalent to regions with @xmath60 and with @xmath61 , respectively ) in the fitting of the trace of the feige 34 spectrum .",
    "consistently , the corresponding spectral regions of the ngc4826 spectrum will be deleted in the further data analysis as well .    the feige 34 spectrum",
    "was extracted from a region of 35 arcsec width along the spatial axis . by contrast , the ngc4826 spectrum was extracted in a strip of 4.3 arcmin width across its nucleus , by adopting the trace fit of the raw feige 34 spectrum , but allowing for a trace displacement of about 3 arcsec along the spatial axis . at each wavelength ,",
    "the estimate of the trace displacement was derived from the fitted position of the true maximum intensity of ngc4826 , under the assumption that the intensity distribution around the central position of the galaxy was represented by a gaussian .",
    "a three - pixel spatial baseline , equivalent to 2.5 arcsec , was chosen for this fit .",
    "larger spatial baselines were found to cause a shift of the new center toward the unobscured side of the galaxy and overall higher intensities and a bluer sed of the extracted ngc4826 spectrum at the dust lane side , with respect to symmetrically opposite positions at the unobscured side of the galaxy , in the inner parts of ngc4826 .",
    "this behaviour was interpreted as due to the strong asymmetry of the observed intensity profile of ngc4826 at these scales ( cf .",
    "block et al .",
    "1994 ; witt et al .",
    "1994 ) and motivated our choice of a three - pixel spatial baseline .",
    "the program spectrum was extracted after background subtraction , the extraction window being limited by the presence of two regions of high instrumental noise at the lower and upper extremities of the chip .",
    "median values of the background at each wavelength were estimated in two opposite equivalent regions of the raw spectrum , adjacent to the extraction window , at about 2.1 arcmin radial distance from the galaxy center , and fitted with a linear relation before subtraction . at the galaxy center ,",
    "the background subtracted at e.g. @xmath62 ( where no line emission is present ) is equal to @xmath63 , with an rms uncertainty of @xmath64 .",
    "this value of the background is equal to the mean of the two median values of the background determined as described before , by construction . within the extraction window ,",
    "the largest variations of the background subtracted at @xmath62 are equal to @xmath653% of the previous value .",
    "they are associated with the extrema on the unobscured and obscured side of the galaxy , respectively . the baseline subtracted as background",
    "is affected by emission from the peripheral regions of the galaxy disk , since the slit length is shorter than the projected angular size of ngc4826 ( cf .",
    "sect . 1 and 2 )",
    "however , at galactocentric distances larger than 2.1 arcmin , the ngc4826 disk emission in the optical has a very shallow radial profile and a negligible intensity , when compared with the emission in its bulge region ( heraudeau & simien 1996 ) .",
    "the intensity profile of ngc4826 at any given wavelength was centered and registered in the spectrum extraction procedure , so that the galaxy center is defined as a result .",
    "however , the true galaxy center may actually lie at a slightly different neighbouring position , as a consequence of the presence of the one - sided dust lane across the galaxy s nucleus .",
    "obviously , the centering precision plays a key - role on the robustness of the following results . in order to verify the correctness of the ngc4826 center position at",
    "any given wavelength , as given by the spectrum extraction procedure , we performed the following test .",
    "first , we assumed the center determined in the spectrum extraction procedure as a reference position and then folded each radial intensity profile around a fictious center , displaced from this reference position by 0 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 pixel , i.e. 0 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 arcsec , respectively . in each case , we extracted radial intensity profiles of ngc4826 at several different wavelengths , and computed the sum of the squares of the differences between the intensities of the two halves of each profile at galactocentric distances of 35  80 arcsec , corresponding to regions beyond the dust lane . within this range of absolute radial distances , the galaxy profile obtained from v - band imaging ( block et al .",
    "1994 ; witt et al .",
    "1994 ) seems to be to first order axi - symmetric .",
    "we found that the residuals did not depend on wavelength .",
    "moreover , most of the minimum values of the sums of the squared residuals were obtained for a displacement of 0 pixel , but a non negligible fraction of the rest of the minima was associated with a displacement of 0.5 pixel .",
    "we further analyzed the ratios of the seds at symmetrically opposite positions relative to the ngc4826 center , on the obscured and unobscured sides of the galaxy , respectively .",
    "we found that , for the 0.5 pixel displacement , these sed ratios showed a u - downturn at the longest wavelengths , at least in the innermost region of the galaxy .",
    "this behaviour is at variance with the common understanding of the wavelength - dependent effects of absorption and scattering by the dust .",
    "therefore , we concluded that the true galaxy center is possibly shifted , at maximum , about 0.25 pixels ( i.e. 0.21 arcsec ) toward the dust lane , with respect to the reference position .",
    "we discuss the effect of such an uncertainty on our results in sect .",
    "after extraction , the ngc4826 spectrum was corrected for atmospheric extinction and calibrated in absolute flux by adopting the sensitivity function and flux conversion determined for feige 34 .",
    "the resultant absolute flux calibration rms error of feige 34 spectrum was 1.1% .",
    "no wiggles in the flux calibration of feige 34 spectrum were present within the spectral range of interest .",
    "the ngc4826 spectrum was extracted in the `` split '' format , so that it was possible to extract further sub - spectra at individual positions , whose radial distances from the galaxy center were odd integer multiples of 0.5 pixel ( i.e. 0.42 arcsec ) .",
    "sub - spectra were extracted within a central region of 50.4 arcsec width , corresponding to twice the projected angular width of the dust lane at @xmath70 .    under the assumption that the intrinsic radiation field of ngc4826 is to first order axially symmetric ( sect .",
    "1 ) , the sed at each position on the unobscured side of the galaxy , as seen by the observer , once corrected for galactic extinction , represents the isrf at the symmetrically opposite position on the obscured side , as seen by the dust lane .",
    "hereafter we neglet the correction for galactic extinction .",
    "conversely , the partially obscured sed emerging through the dust lane consists of partially attenuated , directly transmitted radiation and radiation from the underlying isrf scattered into the same beam .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to attributing the observed asymmetry of the radial intensity profiles of ngc4826 to the presence of the dust lane .",
    "this is supported by the consideration that a much higher degree of axial symmetry is shown by the @xmath32-band surface brightness profile of ngc4826 with respect to the v - band one ( block et al .",
    "1994 ; witt et al .",
    "1994 ) . with this assumption ,",
    "the ratios between the observed seds ( in the 5300  @xmath1 spectral region ) at symmetrically opposite positions relative to the ngc4826 center , on the obscured and unobscured side , respectively , represent the fractions of radiation directly transmitted / scattered by the dust in the dark lane at different galactocentric distances . as a consequence of this division ,",
    "the effects of the milky way interstellar extinction are filtered out .    blue continuum emission , arising from hii regions in the central region of the galaxy , associated in particular with the evil eye ( fig . 1 ; see also keel 1983a ; rubin 1994 ; bker et al .",
    "1999 ) , introduces second order disturbances at the blue - end of the sub - spectra for the corresponding radial distances , as discussed in sect . 4.1 . with high confidence ,",
    "the continuum emission arising from a region @xmath71 in size ( cf .",
    "2 ) associated with any of these hii regions is contributed by exciting stars and gas and reprocessed by local dust .",
    "the atomic continuum emission contributed by the gas is the sum of the two - photon decay emission and of the free - bound continuum radiation .",
    "it is almost constant with wavelength between @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( the location of the paschen break ) and between @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the decrease at the paschen break being of a factor of 3 ( perrin & sivan 1992 ; sivan & perrin 1993 ; darbon , perrin & sivan 1998 ; darbon et al .",
    "hence , the spectral distribution of the atomic continuum emission does not affect the profile of the observed sed except for the effect of the paschen discontinuity , if significant .",
    "shortward of the paschen break the atomic continuum emission also does not exceed 40% of the optical continuum emission originated from scattering of starlight by dust grains in a dusty hii region like the orion nebula ( perrin & sivan 1992 ) .",
    "this fraction seems to be valid also between @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "if this estimate applies to hii regions in ngc4826 , the atomic continuum emission is expected not to exceed 17% of the total optical continuum emission there , under the assumption that the stellar contribution is at least equal to that of the scattered light .",
    "a reasonable representation of an hii region environment is the clumpy shell model of wg00 , which predicts that , in the red , the scattered light ranges from 30 to 60% of the stellar light directly transmitted for reasonable values of the v - band optical depths , increasing from 1 to 10 , without dependence on the intrinsic opacity function . as a consequence , in the observed hii region of ngc4826 , we may expect that the atomic continuum emission does not exceed 8  13% of the total optical continuum emission .",
    "the non - detection of the paschen break in the observed spectra supports the conclusion that the contribution of the atomic continuum emission to the total optical continuum emission collected by our slit width is negligible .",
    "therefore , we do not correct these spectra for the fraction of the atomic continuum emission before the normalization by the corresponding unobscured spectra . in sect .",
    "4.5 we discuss further evidence for the conclusion that the origin of the blue continuum emission arising from these hii regions is mostly stellar .    here we compare the sed ratios with the fractions of directly transmitted / scattered radiation predicted by the wg00 models for different astrophysical environments . for 25 wavelengths , ranging from 1000 to @xmath75 ,",
    "wg00 computed the fraction of incoming radiation which is directly transmitted / scattered by and finally escapes from a galactic environment filled with either homogeneous or two - phase clumpy dust distributions .",
    "each model is identified by its geometry , the intrinsic opacity function ( mw- or smc - like ) , the radial extinction optical depth from the center to the edge of the dust environment in the v - band ( @xmath76 ) , assuming a constant density homogeneous distribution , and the type of structure ( homogeneous / clumpy ) in the dust region . since the detailed analysis of the reddening in the evil eye ( block et al .",
    "1994 ) and the comparison of the co map ( sakamoto et al .",
    "1999 ) with the @xmath17 image ( bker et al .",
    "1999 ) of ngc4826 suggest that the _ global _ distribution of the dust with respect to the stars resembles a screen geometry while the _ local _ distribution of the dust is clumpy , we adopted the wg00 clumpy shell model .",

    "3.2 ) . from the analysis of the @xmath104 values of the least - squares fit model curves , obtained for each sed ratio ,",
    "we attribute an uncertainty of a few per cent to the best - fit @xmath78 . since @xmath78 determines the model fraction of light scattered / directly transmitted by dust at any given wavelength , it is straightforward to derive the seds of the scattered / directly transmitted light .",

    "band - integrated means that the wavelength domain of integration corresponds to the wavelength range where ere is detected ( limited longward at @xmath1 ) , for each value of @xmath88 .",
    "this behaviour is confirmed more quantitatively by fitting the smoothed ere intensity profiles with legendre functions and by numerical integration of the same profiles within the wavelength range of the ere band ( shorter than the 5300  @xmath1 spectral range ) .",
    "smoothing was obtained by averaging the ere intensity in wavelength bins of @xmath105 width .",
    "this width is arbitrary ; however , it is a fairly good compromise in order to reproduce the ere intensity profile via a discrete but not coarse sampling , without being biased by residuals of an uncorrect line - subtraction .",
    "we used the lowest order legendre function reproducing at best the ere intensity profile within the wavelength range of ere detection , for any given @xmath88 .",
    "this best - fit may not represent the unknown and unpredictable shape of the ere intensity profile of the evil eye longward of @xmath1 .",

    "by contrast , after an initial fall from 0.67 to 0.25 for @xmath119 arcsec , @xmath4 rises again to @xmath120 at @xmath121 arcsec and then falls toward 0 for radial distances greater than 11.3 arcsec .",
    "we estimate statistical uncertainties of the order of 7% for @xmath122 , of 9% for @xmath5 and of 11% for @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the radial variation of @xmath5 and @xmath4 is significant .    the shift of the ere band and peak wavelength toward longer wavelengths ( fig .",
    "g ) , as the broad hii region of ngc4826 is approached , is analogous to those manifested in the transition from low - uv photon density environments ( e.g. galactic diffuse ism ) to high - uv photon density environments ( e.g. orion nebula ) ( cf .",

    "therefore , we conclude that the radial dependence of @xmath5 and @xmath4 manifested across the evil eye can not be simply attributed to a radial change of the dust column density .",
    "instead , we infer that the ere mechanism is increasingly quenched when the uv - rich radiation environment of the hii region is approached .",
    "the conclusions reached in sect . 4.2 and 4.3 and the observation that both @xmath5 and @xmath4 diminish in direction of a broad , bright hii region associated with the dark lane , intercepted by the spectrograph slit , suggest that the uv / optical component of the local isrf not only powers the ere but also regulates the photophysics of its carrier ( smith & witt 2001 ) .",

    "our mean central ( within a strip of @xmath150 ) value of @xmath148 is about half of that quoted by keel ( 1983b ) ( @xmath151 ) , obtained within a larger area , equivalent to a circular aperture of 4.7 arcsec in diameter . given the aspect of the nuclear region of ngc4826 in the @xmath19 line emission ( fig .",

    "4a  n : no ere is detected ( within our spectral range and noise threshold ) between the inner edge of this hii region and the outer edge of the dust lane ( fig .",

    ". a shallower decrease of @xmath5 and an increase of @xmath4 take place for 4.6 @xmath231 8.0 arcsec , where @xmath6 is approximately constant and @xmath127 still increases , with no shift of the ere band .",
    "this behaviour may reasonably be due to an increase of the recombination rate , i.e. of the neutral fraction of the ensemble of silicon nanoparticles , the only one capable of luminescing . for @xmath232 8.0 arcsec ,",
    "the once again increasing strength ( probably ) and hardness of the uv radiation field cause the decline of both @xmath5 and @xmath4 and the shift of the ere band toward longer wavelengths , since the optical depth is about constant there . at the inner edge of the hii region ( for @xmath147 13 arcsec ) , @xmath5 and @xmath4 are equal to 0 , as previously discussed .",
    "the absence of ere in the outermost regions of the evil eye , external to this hii region , is consistent with the drop of the dust column density and of the uv / optical radiation field ( as suggested by the precipitous drop of the integrated lyc photon flux ) .",
    "according to smith & witt , the size - dependence of multiple ionization , coupled with single - photon heating , may determine eventually the characteristic size of the ( neutral ) luminescing particles .",
    "in agreement with the results of the latter authors and with the size - dependent photoluminescence properties of silicon nanocrystals ( ledoux et al .",
    "1998 ) , in the evil eye both the ere band and @xmath43 shift to longer wavelengths ( cf .",
    "n ) with increasing @xmath88 , approaching the hii region , as previously shown .",
    "indeed the values of @xmath43 of ngc4826 are even larger than in the 30-doradus , bubble nebula and orion hii regions . aside from the exceptional size distribution of the actively luminescing particles ,",
    "the evil eye shows similar values of @xmath4 ( from 0.7 to 0 , with increasing values of @xmath88 ) to those spanned by different galactic objects , like the diffuse ism , reflection nebulae and the orion nebula ( cf .",
    "gordon , witt & friedmann 1998 ) . relying on the results of the latter authors , we conclude that the ere photon conversion efficiency in ngc4826 is as high as found elsewhere .",
    "ngc4826 is a nearby sab galaxy with an outstanding asymmetrically placed , absorbing dust lane ( called the `` evil eye '' ) across its prominent bulge , associated with several regions of ongoing star formation . for this galaxy",
    ", we obtained accurate low - resolution ( @xmath0/pixel ) long - slit spectroscopy ( kpno 4-meter ) in the 5300  @xmath1 wavelength range , with a slit of 4.4 arcmin length , encompassing the galaxy s bulge size , positioned across its nucleus .",
    "this allowed us to study the wavelength - dependent effects of absorption and scattering by the dust by comparing the stellar spectral energy distributions of pairs of positions across the bulge , symmetrically placed with respect to the nucleus , under the assumption that the intrinsic ( i.e. unobscured ) radiation field is axi - symmetric , except for the extra contribution due to ongoing star formation activity associated with the dust lane . in this analysis we made use of the multiple - scattering radiative transfer calculations of witt & gordon ( 2000 ) .",
    "as a main result , strong residual extended red emission ( ere ) was detected from a region of the evil eye within about 13 arcsec projected distance from the ngc4826 nucleus , adjacent to a broad , bright hii region , intercepted by the spectrograph slit .    in the innermost portion of the dust lane ,",
    "the ere band extends from about 5700 to @xmath1 , with an estimated peak intensity near @xmath3 . here",
    ", the ere - to - scattered light band - integrated intensity ratio is about 0.7 .    at farther galactocentric distances , approaching the broad , bright hii region , the ere band and peak intensity shift toward longer wavelengths , while the ere band - integrated intensity diminishes .",
    "finally , no ere is detected within our spectral range and noise threshold at the inner edge of this hii region and at any other position at larger galactocentric distance .",
    "a secondary maximum of the ere - to - scattered light band - integrated intensity ratio is found near the position of maximum opacity across the dust lane , associated with a secondary maximum of ongoing star formation activity .",
    "these variations reveal a complex dependence of the ere on dust column density and interstellar radiation field .",
    "while the former quantity is derived from modeling , our data do not characterize the uv / optical flux shortward of @xmath11 .",
    "however , we are able to estimate the integrated ( i.e. shortward of @xmath233 ) lyman continuum photon rate and the characteristic effective temperatures of the ob - stars at its origin from the @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) line intensity and from the line intensity ratios @xmath9(\\lambda~6583)/h \\alpha$ ] and @xmath10(\\lambda \\lambda~6716 + 6731)/h \\alpha$ ] .",
    "we interpret the ere as originating from photoluminescence by nanometer - sized oxygen - passivated silicon particles , illuminated by uv / visible photons of the local radiation field .",
    "the phenomenology of the ere in the evil eye is consistently interpreted through the recent model of the photophysics of the ere carrier by smith & witt ( 2001 ) , which attributes a key - role to the experimentally established recognition that photoionization quenches the luminescence of silicon nanoparticles .    when examined within the context of ere observations in the diffuse ism of our galaxy and in a variety of other dusty environments such as reflection nebulae and the orion nebula ,",
    "we conclude that the ere photon conversion efficiency in ngc4826 is as high as found elsewhere , but that the size of the actively luminescing nanoparticles in ngc4826 is about twice as large as those thought to exist in the diffuse ism of our galaxy .",
    "we are grateful to rhodri evans and judith s. young for providing us with , respectively , the v - band image and the @xmath19 image of ngc4826 here displayed .",
    "we are also grateful to daniel schaerer for making available to us the _ costar _ 1997 spectral energy distributions of ob - stars .",
    "we acknowledge the contribution of uma vijh to the making of the pictorial representation of the region of ngc4826 under investigation . this work was supported through grant nag5 - 9202 from the national aeronautics and space administration to the university of toledo .",
