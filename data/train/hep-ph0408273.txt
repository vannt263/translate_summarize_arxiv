    "the theoretical machinery for the determination of @xmath7 from semileptonic @xmath3-meson decays has reached a mature state over the last years . with the very precise data on the exclusive @xmath8 channels as well as on the inclusive",
    "decays @xmath1 from the @xmath3-meson factories the theoretical description has been improved so much that currently relative theoretical uncertainties for @xmath7 of less than 2% are quoted @xcite , yielding a total uncertainty of about 2% @xcite .",
    "the nonperturbative corrections to the inclusive decays are parametrically of order @xmath9 and hence are expected to be smaller than in the exclusive channels , where the corrections are of order @xmath10 . however , the inclusive rate depends on the @xmath2-quark mass @xmath11 , which needs to be determined in a suitable scheme as precisely as possible .",
    "in addition , also the parameters of the heavy quark expansion are needed , such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 at order @xmath9 and the corresponding parameters appearing at higher orders .",
    "these parameters are obtained experimentally by taking moments of the various inclusive distributions ( such as lepton energy spectra or hadronic invariant mass distributions ) , but the higher moments become more and more sensitive to higher - order corrections in @xmath14 , since the leading contribution to the @xmath15th moment is roughly of the order @xmath16 .    when determining the heavy quark parameters from the lepton energy spectrum , the higher moments become sensitive to the endpoint region of the spectrum . using the @xmath14 expansion",
    "the leading term is the partonic rate and still a smooth function , but already the first non - vanishing nonperturbative contribution exhibits an irregular behavior which is unphysical .",
    "the situation is in fact very similar to the one in @xmath17 transitions , where it is known that these singular contributions can be resummed into a shape function . for heavy to light decays , such as the decays @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the twist expansion ,",
    "that is , the resummation of nonperturbative contributions , has been performed to the subleading level in the @xmath14 expansion @xcite .    it has already been noticed some time ago @xcite that the light - cone distribution of the @xmath3 meson also has a significant effect on the endpoint region of the lepton energy spectrum in @xmath1 .",
    "this is due to the fact that numerically @xmath0 .",
    "the charm quark mass thus has to be counted as @xmath20 when performing the power counting .",
    "the endpoint region is known to be determined by the light - cone distribution of the initial state and has the width @xmath21 , which happens to be of the same order as @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , it is useful to consider the effects of the light - cone distribution of the @xmath3 meson also in @xmath1 .    in the present paper",
    "we perform this analysis and compare with the standard expansion . as a by - product",
    ", we suggest a modified twist expansion which can be applied over the full phase space , incorporating the twist expansion in the endpoint region as well as the usual local expansion in the rest of phase space .    furthermore , performing the limit @xmath23 we discover an inconsistency in comparison with previous work @xcite .",
    "it turns out that at subleading order additional operators are needed which are formally of leading order , but have coefficients of subleading order . expanding into the usual local expansion we obtain the correct result for the terms of order @xmath24 , indicating that our result is consistent . as a consequence ,",
    "compared to ref .",
    "@xcite additional nonperturbative input in the form of new shape functions appears .      neglecting the masses of the leptons the energy spectrum of the charged lepton in the @xmath3 rest frame",
    "is given via the optical theorem by @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the rescaled lepton energy , @xmath27 and @xmath28 stands for either @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "the `` @xmath3 expectation value '' is defined as @xmath31 , where the qcd states are normalized to @xmath32 .",
    "the operator @xmath33 has the form @xmath34 , \\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the lepton spin and momentum .",
    "the effective weak current is @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 denoting the lepton spinor . plugging this into eq .",

    "we also define @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "as already noted , the @xmath30-quark mass satisfies @xmath0 and thus @xmath53 . the kinematic endpoint in the local ope",
    "is given by @xmath54 , the partonic endpoint .",
    "the endpoint region of the lepton energy spectrum is defined by @xmath55 , and it is well known @xcite that in this region the local ope breaks down .",
    "however , it has been shown that one may still perform a light - cone or twist expansion @xcite .    to set up the light - cone expansion we use the velocity @xmath46 and the lepton momentum @xmath36 to define a basis of two light - cone vectors ,    @xmath56    satisfying @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the metric is decomposed accordingly @xmath59 and a generic four - momentum @xmath60 can be written as @xmath61 where we defined @xmath62    the power counting @xmath63 yields the standard twist expansion by expanding in powers of @xmath64 , taking also into account that @xmath53 .",
    "note that this power counting becomes wrong for small lepton energies , since @xmath65 becomes of @xmath66 . in this case",
    "the spectrum is described by the usual local ope . however , as we shall discuss below , with a slight modification of the twist expansion it is possible to describe the spectrum also for small lepton energies .",
    "the relevant kinematic variable in the ope is @xmath67 , the light - cone components of which are @xmath68 obviously all @xmath69 dependence occurs in the combination @xmath70 . in the local ope",
    "the complete @xmath71 dependence is expanded . in particular , this produces terms of the form @xmath72 , which become large , of @xmath66 , near the endpoint .",
    "the twist expansion avoids these terms , since only the @xmath73 and @xmath74 dependences are expanded .        alternatively to eq .",
    ", we may as well treat the complete dependence on @xmath75 ( and @xmath76 ) exactly .",
    "that is , we use the power counting @xmath77 and only expand in powers of @xmath73 and @xmath74 from the very beginning .",
    "the order in @xmath64 of a twist term given by eq .   corresponds to the order of the first local term it contains , once the usual local ope is performed .",
    ".   defines what we call the modified twist expansion and holds for large _ and _ small lepton energies .",
    "our results will therefore be valid over the whole lepton energy spectrum , providing a correct interpolation between the usual twist and local expansions .",
    "our modified expansion is a direct extension of the usual twist expansion .",
    "the latter does not expand @xmath78 because both @xmath79 and @xmath69 are considered @xmath80 .",
    "once part of the @xmath69 dependence is left unexpanded , it is consistent to keep the complete @xmath69 dependence unexpanded , as it just means to keep correct small terms , which can now be treated exactly .",
    "this is similar to the local expansion , where @xmath81 , although being numerically small , is always treated exactly , because it can be treated exactly .",
    "once we exclude @xmath69 from the power counting and treat it exactly , there is no need to count @xmath79 as @xmath80 anymore .",
    "thus we can treat it exactly much like @xmath76 .",
    "this in turn extends the validity of our expansion down to low lepton energies ( where numerically @xmath79 is of order one which caused the breakdown of the usual twist expansion ) .    in other words , starting from the full expression ( including all @xmath71-components )",
    "both expansions expand the @xmath73 and @xmath74 components .",
    "this is where we stop , while the usual expansion additionally neglects terms of second and higher twist order caused by @xmath82 , e.g. , terms like @xmath83 .",
    "we keep all those `` kinematic '' twist terms , because they are of @xmath66 for low lepton energies .",
    "note that we do _ not _ claim to include all second - order twist contributions , i.e. , our spectrum is only correct to @xmath80 in the endpoint region , but it is correct to @xmath84 for low lepton energies",
    ".    therefore , the difference to the usual twist expansion , defined by eq .  , is that the modified expansion automatically keeps all twist contributions that in the usual power counting are of higher order only because of additional factors of @xmath75 or @xmath76 .",
    "these contributions are purely kinematic and do not require additional operators in the twist expansion , but appear only as higher - order terms in the ope coefficients .",
    "taking them into account yields a consistent result valid over the full region of lepton energies .",
    "to keep things simple and to exhibit the structure of the ope we will perform it in terms of qcd light - cone operators .",
    "schematically , it has the form @xmath85 in a second step the @xmath3 expectation values of the @xmath86 are parametrized in terms of shape functions .",
    "we expand to @xmath84 as defined by eq .  .",
    "with respect to the usual twist power counting this includes all contributions of leading and subleading twist , as well as some of second and even third order . in other words",
    ", we obtain the full coefficients of all operators with up to two covariant derivatives , which in particular retains all local terms up to local @xmath84 .",
    "to do so , we need to evaluate the zero- and one - gluon matrix elements of @xmath33 , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : me ] , which we do to leading order in @xmath87 .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath6 and later take the limit @xmath23 .",

    "the leading operator has the form @xmath94 and its coefficient is @xmath95 with @xmath96 and @xmath97 . note that in the modified twist expansion we keep the contributions proportional to @xmath98 , which would usually be considered as subleading twist due to the additional factor of @xmath99 .",
    "the @xmath3 expectation value of @xmath100 is given to leading order by the leading shape function , @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the @xmath3 meson state in the infinite - mass limit and the @xmath103 are the static heavy quark fields .    together with eqs .",
    "and we find the lepton energy spectrum at leading order    [ dgqdy_to-0,0 ] @xmath104 where ( @xmath105 ) @xmath106 contains a purely kinematic @xmath65 dependence determined by the parton model .",
    "letting @xmath107 we obtain the result for @xmath17 @xmath108    obviously , the leading - order result amounts to convoluting the kinematic @xmath65 dependence of the parton model with @xmath109 .",
    "the overall factor of @xmath110 is not convoluted , since it is a trivial phase space factor , unrelated to the ope .",
    "thus , in the modified expansion we keep the factor @xmath110 and eqs .",
    "are valid ( to @xmath66 ) over the entire phase space .    furthermore , from the first relation in eq .",
    "it is apparent that the twist expansion will always yield a convolution of the kinematic @xmath65 dependence rather than the @xmath11 dependence , as originally argued in ref .",
    "while a convolution of the @xmath11 dependence is correct to leading order in the usual twist expansion , it introduces spurious subleading corrections , as has been noted before . in the modified expansion it already fails at leading order .",
    "the light - cone operators needed to consistently match all contributions of @xmath80 and @xmath84 are given by    [ higher - ops ] @xmath111    here , @xmath112 ( with @xmath113 ) , and the @xmath114-function factors are    @xmath115    this operator basis differs from that introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and used in previous applications @xcite by the different @xmath116 and the additional operator @xmath117 .",
    "we note that this is not an artefact of our modified expansion . with respect to the usual twist power counting eq .",
    "both operators are formally of leading order . nevertheless , their coefficients are of at least subleading order in this power counting , because during the matching procedure one effectively shifts orders from the operators to their coefficients by partial integration with respect to @xmath118 , as will be illustrated later on . in turn",
    ", the @xmath3 expectation values of @xmath116 and @xmath117 will be parametrized in terms of derivatives of shape functions . in the final expression for the spectrum these derivatives",
    "are then shifted by partial integration to act on the ope coefficients .",
    "this ensures that in the final result the coefficients of all shape functions ( apart from kinematic twist terms ) are of usual twist @xmath66 .",
    "the same also holds for the contributions of @xmath119 and @xmath120 that are of usual subsubleading twist .",

    "the first superscript denotes the order of the coefficient s term in the ope as it appears in the usual twist expansion ( i.e. , the order of the respective shape function once the @xmath3 expectation value is taken ) , while the second superscript denotes the order of the coefficients s term in our modified expansion .    for the above reasons",
    ", we only quote the derivatives of the ope coefficients , as these are the @xmath66 coefficients which will eventually enter the energy spectrum .",
    "the ope coefficients are obtained by integrating over @xmath118 , which increases their order in the usual twist power counting .",
    "the constants of integration are such that each integral vanishes at @xmath124 , that is , the kinematic @xmath125-function does not contribute to the partial integrations .",
    "we emphasize that the ope is valid to @xmath80 over the entire phase space and to @xmath84 away from the endpoint .",
    "when expanded into local operators , it correctly reproduces the full result to @xmath84 @xcite , as well as all local @xmath126 terms @xcite corresponding to leading and subleading order in the usual twist expansion .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out a subtlety in the matching procedure leading to eq .  .",
    "the @xmath80 terms contained in eq .",
    "are @xmath127 and can be written as a convolution in two ways , @xmath128 corresponding to the two possibilities for the matching @xmath129 this ambiguity has to be resolved by studying the one - gluon matrix element , since @xmath130 commutes with the @xmath131 function , while the covariant derivative and the @xmath132 function do not .",
    "the gluon has momentum @xmath133 , a polarization vector @xmath134 , and we work in light - cone gauge , @xmath135 . in accordance with eq .",
    ", we treat @xmath136 exactly and expand only in @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 .",
    "to @xmath80 we find    @xmath141    showing that we have to match onto @xmath116 .",
    "taking the massless limit ( i.e. , @xmath107 , @xmath142 ) we note that this is in disagreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the first possibility in eq .   has been chosen .",
    "note that the equations of motion of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) can not be used for the operator @xmath116 , since the covariant derivative does not act directly on the heavy quark fields .",
    "a similar problem occurs in the comparison of our @xmath84 contributions with the ones in ref .  @xcite . in our case",
    "these contributions are more complicated , requiring the two different operators @xmath117 and @xmath119 .",
    "this is again in contrast with ref .",
    "@xcite , where only @xmath119 appears . in both cases",
    "the differences start at @xmath126 in the local expansion of the operators , and thus also in the final spectrum , as we will see below .",
    "while this paper was in the review process , studies of @xmath143 based on `` soft collinear effective theory '' ( scet ) appeared which shed some light on these differences @xcite .",
    "the scet - based calculations show that the basis introduced originally in ref .",
    "@xcite is a complete basis of subleading operators , at least at tree level .",
    "however , in all these cases the light - cone vectors are defined based on the momentum @xmath144 , where @xmath28 is the total leptonic momentum . here and in ref .",
    "@xcite a different choice of light - cone vectors is used , which is based on @xmath145 , where @xmath36 is the momentum of the charged lepton only .",
    "it should be possible to relate the two choices by a coordinate transformation , i.e. , by a reparametrization .",
    "we shall not go into any details here , but our results show that for the latter choice of light - cone coordinates the operator basis in ref .",
    "@xcite is incomplete .",
    "in the last step we need to parametrize the @xmath3 expectation values of the operators and . to be consistent with our modified expansion we have to include all shape functions of leading and subleading order in the usual twist power counting , but also those of usual subsubleading twist with moments of local @xmath84 .",
    "the expansion of the qcd fields and states into hqet ones produces many additional operators [ e.g. , the @xmath146 and @xmath147 of refs .",
    "@xcite ] and shape functions . however , these higher - order shape functions always occur in particular combinations with those arising at leading order in the hqet expansion and can be suitably combined with them .",
    "we therefore take a different approach and directly parametrize the operators in qcd , which automatically combines the leading and higher - order hqet shape functions appropriately .",
    "this is in fact similar to what is used in the context of the local expansion , where for example the matrix element corresponding to the kinetic energy operator @xmath148 is also defined using the states of full qcd , and thus this matrix element is equal to the kinetic energy matrix element @xmath12 of hqet only to leading order in the @xmath14 expansion .    for the leading operator we have @xmath149 which is exact and",
    "defines the two qcd shape functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "they may be expanded into the usual ones of hqet ,    @xmath152    alternatively , we can directly perform their moment expansions and use hqet to parametrize their moments ,    @xmath153    where we abbreviated @xmath154 and the @xmath155 and @xmath156 are defined in @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath150 and @xmath151 are defined in qcd without any reference to the heavy quark limit .",
    "nevertheless , heavy quark symmetry still tells us that @xmath151 is suppressed by one power of @xmath64 with respect to @xmath150 .",
    "the normalization of @xmath150 is exact to all orders in qcd due to @xmath2-quark number conservation , while all other moments receive further corrections of local @xmath157 and higher .",
    "the leading contribution to the neglected moments is also of local @xmath157 .    for the higher - twist operators we find    @xmath158 ' ( n - v)^\\mu   - [ f_1({\\omega } ) v^\\alpha + k_1({\\omega } )",

    "furthermore , since @xmath1 has a sensitivity to the light - cone distribution functions of the @xmath3 meson one could also make an attempt to extract the shape functions from this process . however , for a consistent treatment one would need to include also radiative corrections , which could be considered in the framework of scet .",
