    "the availability of cold and ultracold dimers provides a unique opportunity to investigate fundamental quantum processes @xcite .",
    "the efforts of many experimental groups are focused on the production of heteronuclear alkali dimers , as they constitute a prototype of an ultracold quantum gas with long - range dipole - dipole interactions . in this context , the photoassociation of lics , nacs , krb , and rbcs has been reported recently @xcite , while feshbach resonances have been observed for lina , lik , lirb , and krb @xcite .",
    "the long - range anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction between these polar molecules gives rise to an intriguing many body physics with new interesting physical phenomena .",
    "in addition , these systems allow for a wide range of applications , such as state resolved chemical reactions @xcite or quantum computing @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting is the study of the influence of external fields on these molecular systems .",
    "external fields play a key role in trapping and cooling processes as well as in the manipulation and control of the dipole - dipole interaction , chemical reactions or collisions @xcite . as an example , the application of an electric field has been predicted to significantly affect the photoassociation process of ultracold polar molecules as well as the subsequent radiative decay cascade @xcite . on the other hand , the internal structure of molecules is significantly affected by an electric field .",
    "the strong field regime is characterized by the appearance of pendular states : the molecule is oriented along the field axis and can be described as a coherent superposition of field - free rotational states . recently , the authors have performed studies of the rovibrational spectra of co and lics in their electronic ground states exposed to an electric field : the orientation and hybridization of the angular motion , the stark shift , and the radiative decay properties have been investigated for a wide range of field strengths and rovibrational levels @xcite . in the present work",
    "we extend our previous studies by performing a comparative analysis of several polar alkali dimers which are of immediate experimental interest .",
    "specifically , we analyze the influence of a static electric field on the @xmath0 electronic ground state of @xmath1li@xmath2na , @xmath1li@xmath3k , @xmath1li@xmath4rb , @xmath5li@xmath6cs , @xmath2na@xmath7k , @xmath2na@xmath6cs , @xmath7k@xmath8rb , and @xmath8rb@xmath6cs .",
    "in the following we consider the field regime where perturbation theory holds for the description of the molecular electronic structure .",
    "the born - oppenheimer approach then provides the following hamiltonian for the nuclear motion of a polar dimer in its electronic ground state exposed to a static electric field @xmath9 where the molecule fixed frame with the origin at the center of mass of the nuclei has been employed , ( @xmath10 ) being the internuclear distance and the euler angles .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the vibrational kinetic energy , the reduced mass of the nuclei , the rotational angular momentum , the field - free electronic potential energy curve ( pec ) , and the electronic dipole moment function ( edmf ) , respectively .",
    "the electric field is taken parallel to the laboratory frame @xmath16-axis with strength @xmath17 .",
    "since we restrict ourselves on a non - relativistic treatment , couplings to electronic states of different spin symmetry do not arise .    in the framework of the effective rotor approach @xcite",
    ", the rovibrational hamiltonian ( [ eq : rotvib_hamiltonian ] ) reduces to @xmath18 with @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the field - free vibrational wave function and energy for a given vibrational state @xmath23 with @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "this approximation , which is valid for large parts of the rovibrational spectrum , relies on two assumptions : i ) the rotational and vibrational energy scales should differ by several orders of magnitude and can therefore be separated adiabatically , and ii ) the field influence on the vibrational motion is very small and can consequently be treated by perturbation theory . besides reducing ( [ eq : rotvib_hamiltonian ] ) to an one - dimensional problem , this approach allows us to compare the field influence on several vibrational levels , and even between different molecular species , by means of the parameter @xmath25 which derives from rescaling the hamiltonian ( [ hamil_era ] ) using the rotational constant of a given vibrational state , @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 acquires the same order of magnitude as the rescaled rotational kinetic energy , @xmath28 , the rotational dynamics is severely altered by the interaction with the electric field , while @xmath29 provides an estimation of the field strength needed to show a significant effect .",
    "we remark that in the presence of the electric field , only the magnetic quantum number is retained , whereas the vibrational and rotational ones are no more conserved .",
    "however , for reasons of addressability , we will label the electrically dressed states by means of their field - free vibrational , rotational , and magnetic quantum numbers @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , in this letter we focus on rotationally non - excited states with corresponding field - free quantum numbers @xmath31 .",
    "the computational method used to solve the full rovibrational schrdinger equation is described in ref .",
    "the pecs of the singlet electronic ground states of the alkali dimers employed here are derived from either experimental or theoretical studies . for the pecs of lina , lik , lics ,",
    "nak , nacs , krb , and rbcs we use very accurate experimental data from spectroscopic analyses @xcite .",
    "the lirb pec is taken from theoretical studies based on a semiempirical method @xcite .",
    "when describing vibrationally highly excited states , special attention has to be payed to the long - range part of the pecs : for lina , lics , nacs , krb , and rbcs , the pecs include van der waals terms , @xmath32 , and an exchange energy term , @xmath33 , see refs .",
    "@xcite , with @xmath34 for lina @xcite .",
    "the long - range part of the nak pec additionally includes damping functions @xmath35 in the van der waals expansion , @xmath36 , and a different expression for the exchange energy , @xmath37 @xcite . for the lirb dimer only the first van der waals term , @xmath38 ,",
    "is considered @xcite .",

    "the edmfs employed for the lina , lik , lics , nak , nacs , and krb systems are computed by the same semiempirical technique as the lirb pec @xcite .",
    "the rbcs edmf is taken from an ab - initio relativistic valence - bound calculation @xcite . since for the electronic ground state of the polar alkali",
    "dimers the long - range behaviour of the edmf is given by @xmath47 @xcite , this asymptotic function has been fitted to the theoretical data at large internuclear distances .",
    "we note that , when necessary for computational reasons , the short - range behaviour of the edmfs is linearly extrapolated .",
    "the resulting edmfs are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : edmf ] as a function of the internuclear distance .",
    "all edmfs are negative and exhibit a broad minimum which is shifted with respect to the minimum of the corresponding pec , _",
    "e.g. _ , by @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the krb and lics dimers , respectively .",
    "the edmfs of lirb , nak , nacs , and krb become positive for @xmath50 albeit approaching zero thereafter ; this change of sign will be reflected in the response of highly excited rovibrational levels to the field .",
    "however , this has to be taken with a grain of salt since ab - initio electronic structure calculations of molecules typically employ basis sets of exponentially localized functions , which do not easily catch the long - range behaviour of the atom - atom interaction .",
    "the lics edmf has the largest absolute value with a maximum of @xmath51 at @xmath52 .",
    "the edmfs of lina , krb , and rbcs show only a weak dependence on @xmath53 for a wide range of internuclear distances and overall comparatively small values for the dipole moment .     versus the field - free vibrational quantum number @xmath23 for the same dimers as in fig .",
    "[ fig : edmf ] . ]",
    "let us start by analyzing the behaviour of the parameter @xmath54 as a function of the vibrational quantum number . in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega_nu ] , the modulus of @xmath54 is presented for the @xmath55 levels of all dimers on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the maximum vibrational quantum numbers considered are @xmath56 ( lik ) , 46 ( lina ) , 48 ( lirb ) , 53 ( lics ) , 73 ( nak ) , 85 ( nacs ) , 97 ( krb ) , and 135 ( rbcs ) ; the very last vibrational bands have not been included . for all dimers",
    ", @xmath57 shows a qualitatively similar but quantitatively different behaviour as a function of @xmath23 : after a weakly pronounced maximum , @xmath57 decreases rapidly for high vibrational excitations .",
    "in particular , nak , krb , and rbcs show a plateau - like behaviour indicating a quantitatively similar field impact in many vibrational bands . according to their @xmath57 values",
    ", the considered molecules can be classified into four groups whose response to the field will be of comparable magnitude for a large part of their spectra . possessing the largest @xmath57 values ,",
    "the first group is formed by the nacs and rbcs dimers and their @xmath58 states , followed by the @xmath59 levels of lics and nak . despite the large lics edmf , the corresponding @xmath57 is only approximately half of the @xmath57 belonging to nacs and rbcs : the large reduced masses of the latter compensate their smaller dipole moments .",
    "the third set contains lik , lirb , and krb and their lowest @xmath60 vibrational bands . finally , lina will be least affected by the field which is due to both small @xmath15 and @xmath12 .",
    "we remark that the sign of @xmath54 depends crucially on the corresponding dipole moment : while being generally negative , the change of sign of the nak , nacs , and krb edmfs at long distances causes @xmath61 for their @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 levels , respectively .",
    "in particular , the minimum observed for the @xmath65 level of krb can be attributed to this change of sign .",
    "for all molecules considered , the slope of @xmath57 becomes very steep as @xmath23 approaches the dissociation threshold .",
    "consequently @xmath57 drastically varies from its maximum to its minimum ; for example we get for lina @xmath66 versus @xmath67 cm / kv , and for nacs @xmath68 versus @xmath69 cm / kv .",
    "hence , for high - lying vibrational excitations the field strength should be enhanced at least one order of magnitude to obtain similar field - dressed states as on the lower part of the rovibrational spectrum .    in order to quantify the spectral changes upon the application of the electric field , we consider the ratio of the stark shift to the rotational spacing in the presence of the field @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the energies of the @xmath55 and @xmath73 levels at field strength @xmath17",
    "; for high - field seekers we get @xmath74 . if @xmath75 , the field - dressed spectrum shows many similarities to the field - free one . in particular",
    ", this criterion is fulfilled for @xmath76 : in second order perturbation theory the @xmath55 and @xmath73 states are shifted by @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xcite , respectively , compared to the field - free rotational spacing of @xmath79 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : kappa](a ) and ( b ) the parameter @xmath80 is presented as a function of the vibrational quantum number for @xmath81 and @xmath82 kv / cm , respectively ; the selected field strengths are chosen such that the experimentally accessible range within the strong field regime is covered . besides showing high - field seeking character , the behaviour of @xmath80 has many analogies among the considered molecules .",
    "initially , it has a weak dependence on the vibrational excitation , thereby smoothly increasing as @xmath23 is enhanced and passing a shallow maximum ( due to the semilogarithmic scale , this increasing trend appears as a plateau ) . for higher vibrational excitations ,",
    "@xmath80 rapidly decreases as the levels get closer to the dissociation limit : this reduction can be up to one order of magnitude when @xmath23 is enhanced by merely one quantum . the above classification of the considered molecules",
    "is equally observed for @xmath80 .",
    "the lowest values appear for lina , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , for @xmath81 and @xmath82 kv / cm , respectively , _ i.e. _ , the impact of the field on the spectrum is negligible for the smaller of these two field strengths .",
    "in contrast , nacs and rbcs are most affected by the field @xmath81 kv / cm , with @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "lics and nak possess values @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively . for lirb and krb we found @xmath91 for the @xmath92 and @xmath93 states , whereas a smaller value is achieved for lik with @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "an increase of the field strength by one order of magnitude ( @xmath96 kv / cm ) produces a significant variation of @xmath80 , which depends on the system and especially on the states under consideration .",
    "indeed , we observe @xmath97 for most levels of lics , nak , nacs , and rbcs .",
    "the levels @xmath98 , and @xmath99 of lik , lirb , and krb satisfy @xmath100 . in order to provide a reasonable scaling ,",
