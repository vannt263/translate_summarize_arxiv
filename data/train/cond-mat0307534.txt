    "when the temperature is lowered below level spacing @xmath14 , electrons in the granular metal can propagate ( diffuse or hop over many grains ) coherently just like in a disordered metal . in the incoherent regime @xmath15 , only charging effects and nearest - neighbour hopping ( in the second order of the tunnelling matrix element ) are relevant , and it is possible to formulate the problem in terms of longitudinal electromagnetic phase ( or voltage ) fluctuations on the grains@xcite . for large inter - grain conductance @xmath2 ,",
    "the conductivity decreases logarithmically with temperature independent of dimensionality@xcite , reminiscent of many experiments@xcite .",
    "the essential physics of this result was recognised some time ago as washed out coulomb blockade for the quantum dot coupled to a conductive environment@xcite . for intermediate conductance @xmath8 ( and sufficiently low temperature ) , we derive within the same approach a soft activation conduction ( @xmath16 ) by a charge excitation ( later referred to as a `` puddle '' ) shared between many grains due to incoherent tunnelling . in the itinerant ( or large - scale diffusion over many grains ) regime at low temperatures @xmath17 , the granular metal for large conductance @xmath2 is naturally described by altshuler - aronov theory@xcite .",
    "we employ the phase functional approach suggested over two decades ago by ambegaokar , eckern , and schn ( aes ) @xcite .",
    "the original model described the tunnelling dynamics of granular superconductors , but nowadays this approach is increasingly used to study granular metals as well @xcite .",
    "the aes action @xmath18 for granular metals consists of two contributions , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 represents charging of the grains , and @xmath21 represents tunnelling between neighbouring grains , @xmath22 .",

    "conductivity in the aes model is a second order ( in hopping amplitude ) incoherent tunnelling process between neighbouring grains .",
    "the elastic tunnelling lifetime @xmath35 of the electron on the grain is @xmath36 .",
    "the condition , defining the granularity of the material and allowing averaging over fermionic intra - grain states , is that the tunnelling lifetime @xmath35 is much longer than the thouless diffusion time @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is intra - grain diffusion coefficient , and @xmath39 is a size of a grain ) . another relevant condition is the implicit requirement of energy relaxation in the grains .",
    "the characteristic times associated with these incoherent dissipative processes should be shorter than tunnelling lifetime , consequently coherent combination of wavefunctions over grains can not be written .",
    "moreover , our diagrammatic analysis shows ( see also ref.@xcite ) that higher order processes ( @xmath40 , etc . )",
    "can be neglected when @xmath41 .",
    "such a condition allows us to neglect `` dressing '' of the tunnelling vertex @xmath33 by further tunnelling lines .",

    "secondly , as discussed in the context of granular superconductors@xcite , theoretical calculations based on regular josephson arrays seem to be relevant .",
    "the reason is that even for a wide distribution of couplings , only a narrow range of couplings is relevant , since ( a ) the extremely weak links can effectively be disregarded and ( b ) for links that are much stronger than average , one can approximate the connected grains as one single grain . while the tunnelling probability changes exponentially with length , the charging energy changes only linearly , so the variation of charging energies is relatively small .",
    "the system then effectively consists of such renormalised grains linked by tunnelling of similar magnitude .",
    "thirdly , if conduction occurs through a few 1d paths , our result , being dimensionality independent , still applies .",
    "the observations@xcite , according to our picture , are robust even upon application of strong magnetic fields ( @xmath157 tesla ) and are independent of dimensionality@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , further work needs to be done to understand properly granular metals with strong variation in inter - grain couplings .    the aes approach , we use , views conduction as a fermi golden - rule type incoherent tunnelling process .",
    "the obvious difference between our picture of soft activation and the efros - shklovskii@xcite(es ) theory , which also gives a similar temperature dependence of conductivity , is the on - site charging energy cost @xmath1 in our model and lack of thereof in es theory .",
    "furthermore , the mutual interaction of charges ( and excitonic effects ) on widely separated grains plays no significant role in our analysis unlike in es theory .",
    "since the soft activation mechanism involves only nearest - neighbour hopping in comparison with long - distance variable range hopping , the magnetoresistance of soft activation here is expected to be very weak , which is consistent with experiments@xcite .",
    "another possibility@xcite considered in the literature suggests that the observed soft activation could be an artifact of a special distribution of grain sizes .",
    "such a hope is belied by observation @xcite of the same soft activation in samples with a very narrow distribution of grain sizes .",
    "also if we accept the conduction process as proceeding through tunnelling of charge between neighbouring grains , there would be little likelihood of finding the percolation paths in the wide range of temperatures through appropriately sized grains , should they exist , as neighbours .",
    "the relevance of our results as well as refs.@xcite should be explored beyond carefully prepared granular arrays .",
    "recently , a logarithmic temperature dependence of conductivity in strong magnetic fields@xcite and granular ( or domain ) structure@xcite has been observed in certain underdoped cuprates .",
    "the insulating phase ( even more underdoped ) in the same materials exhibited the soft activation behaviour@xcite , which may be due to the mechanism proposed in this paper . in conclusion ,",
    "our analysis of transport in granular arrays at not too low temperatures @xmath158 in the framework of the aes approach shows that the transitions from a logarithmic temperature dependence of conductivity for strong inter - grain coupling ( @xmath159 ) to the soft activation behaviour for intermediate coupling ( @xmath160 ) and further to the hard activation behaviour for weak coupling @xmath161 can be understood as arising from the competition between coulomb blockade and tunnelling .",

    "if @xmath32 were zero , then the relative phase contribution to @xmath172 is also @xmath173 , so that @xmath174 , in accordance with our expectation for isolated grains . for a finite value of @xmath32",
    ", we demonstrate below that correlation functions of the relative phase fluctuations at large @xmath35 decrease only algebraically as a function of temperature , and do not show a hard coulomb gap@xcite .",
    "the gaplessness of the relative phase fluctuations unambiguously proves that the minimum charging energy of the two grains is halved , @xmath167 , and associated only with the average phase .",
    "if instead , the relative phase correlator were gapped , with some effective charging energy @xmath175 , then the correlation function would decrease exponentially at long-@xmath35 with the corresponding charging energy .",
    "therefore the question about the effective charging energy is equivalent to the question of considering the long-@xmath35 asymptotics ( or equivalently low temperatures ) of the correlation function @xmath172 .",
    "the last statement is of a general character , since the long - time ( or low temperature ) asymptotics always reveals the lowest energy excitations ( or configurations of the @xmath176-field ) of the system .",
    "namely , if the charge gap exists , this will become evident as an exponential decay of the corresponding correlation function at long times . in the literature , the charge gap is occasionally related to the amplitude of coulomb blockade oscillations as a function of a gate voltage on a grain . in our case , the charge gap is the cost of putting one excess charge on a grain",
    ". these two definitions are not necessarily the same . for calculating the conductivity of the granular system",
    ", our definition of the charge gap is the appropriate one .",
    "let us consider the relative phase correlator @xmath177 which has been extensively studied in the literature , so a comparison with known results is possible .",
    "besides , @xmath178 so if we can show that the large @xmath35 behaviour of @xmath179 does not have a hard gap , then it is true for @xmath180 too",
    ". we claim ( and we are not the first ones ) that the correlation function @xmath179 of the single - phase action decays , in fact , as a power - law , @xmath181 , at very large @xmath35 and _ not exponentially_. here @xmath182 is an energy scale exponentially small in @xmath32 .",
    "thus the correlation function of relative phase fluctuations is not gapped for long times .",
    "this is a crucial point because a temperature dependence of @xmath179 that is not exponentially small in temperature at large @xmath35 invariably leads to a soft activation behaviour of conductivity at low temperatures ( see concluding remarks in this section ) .",
    "several arguments based on general results of statistical physics and mesoscopics as well as our numerical monte carlo simulations prove beyond doubt that the correlation function @xmath179 decays algebraically ( proportional to @xmath183 ) .",
    "first , note that the action for relative phase fluctuations is a one - dimensional field theory with a long - range interaction , @xmath184 , in imaginary time . a general theorem of statistical physics due to griffiths@xcite states that the correlation function @xmath179 can not decay faster than the interaction , @xmath184 .",
    "the exponential decay is much faster than algebraic decay and therefore not possible .",
    "second , it is widely recognised in the mesoscopics literature that at low temperatures the tunnelling to a quantum dot is dominated by so - called inelastic ( or elastic ) cotunnelling processes@xcite . in the case of two grains ,",
    "cotunnelling processes which are second order processes in the conductance @xmath32 correspond to creation of electron - hole pairs on both grains .",
    "these processes are the lowest - energy gapless processes which can be closely associated with long-@xmath35 behaviour of @xmath179 , once again this demonstrates that the charge gap at low temperatures is effectively zero .",
    "in fact , the picture of the charge sharing can be equally well discussed in terms of the balance between coulomb blockade and cotunnelling processes for a finite set of grains .",
    "our results concerning cotunnelling processes are somewhat non - trivial , because we describe these processes in terms of the parameter @xmath185 for @xmath186 ( unlike the originally considered case of @xmath187 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "third , we undertook numerical simulations of the single - phase aes action using the path integral monte carlo method .",
    "it is possible to calculate directly by this method , without any approximations , not only the correlation function @xmath179 but also the parameter @xmath75 as a function of @xmath32 and @xmath188 numerical results show clearly that the correlation function behaves as @xmath189 in the large-@xmath35 limit .",
    "note that a rough estimate of @xmath179 as @xmath190/\\exp(-s(k))$ ] using eq.([twograinaction ] ) gives @xmath191 $ ] . for small values of @xmath75 ,",
    "the gaussian approximation is inaccurate , nevertheless the lorentzian long time behaviour of @xmath179 inferred from eq.([twograinaction ] ) clearly anticipates the @xmath192 result of exact numerical calculations , with @xmath193 and large @xmath35 .    in what follows we summarise the results of the path",
    "integral monte carlo simulations ( the description of the method and further results will be published elsewhere@xcite ) . in fig.[evidence_lnctau_lnbeta ] we present the correlation function @xmath179 for @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "one can see clearly that at short imaginary times-@xmath35 , @xmath196 , which is consistent with @xmath73 calculated in eq.([grenormal1 ] ) ignoring winding numbers and various others@xcite . at long times-@xmath35 , in fig.[evidence_lnctau_lnbeta ] , the correlation function decays as @xmath183 .",
    "@xmath197 vs @xmath198 for @xmath194 ( red ) and @xmath195 ( blue ) , at @xmath199 .",
    "the data ( solid curves ) show a crossover from logarithmic behaviour @xmath200(dotted curves ) to the power - law behaviour @xmath201(dashed ) .",
    "discrepancies at small @xmath35 are due to discretisation error . note that @xmath200 is not exactly a power law ( or a straight line on a @xmath202 plot ) : the cosec squared flattens out at @xmath203 . ]",
    "the detailed behaviour of the parameter @xmath75 is given in fig.[evidence_dpsi_g_beta16 ] as a function of @xmath32 and in fig.[evidence_gamma_beta_g32 ] as a function of temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the exact calculation of the determinant of the residual fluctuations in the gaussian approximation gives instead of @xmath204 in eq.[twograinaction ] the following expression : @xmath205 where @xmath206 and for brevity we denote the relative winding number @xmath207 as @xmath208 .",

    "the blue dotted curve is the gaussian approximation of eq.([gaussiangamma ] ) and the blue dashed curve is eq.([effectivegamma ] ) which can be shown to follow from eq.([gaussiangamma ] ) using stirling s approximation for the gamma functions .",
    "the red dashed curve corresponds to setting @xmath210 .",
    "fig.[evidence_gamma_beta_g32 ] compares @xmath211 , calculated numerically , with the gaussian approximation in eq.([gaussiangamma ] ) ( blue dashed curve ) , and @xmath212 calculated from @xmath213 ( top red curve ) and @xmath212 with an adjustable cutoff ( lower red curve ) , as a function of temperature .",

    "dashed black line : small-@xmath32 perturbation theory . dotted blue line : @xmath216 , using the gaussian approximation of eq.([gaussiangamma ] ) .",
    "dashed blue line : @xmath217 , using eq.([effectivegamma ] ) which can be deduced from eq.([gaussiangamma ] ) using stirling s approximation .",
    "dashed red line : @xmath218 , i.e. , the derivative of @xmath73 with respect to @xmath32 . ]",
    "@xmath75 versus @xmath219 for @xmath220 .",
    "solid black line : monte carlo calculation . dashed blue line : @xmath211 in eq.([gaussiangamma ] ) obtained by considering gaussian fluctuations .",
    "top red line : @xmath212 extracted from @xmath179 with @xmath35 proportional to @xmath219 .",
    "bottom red line : @xmath212 with adjusted cutoff , @xmath221 $ ] . clearly , @xmath222 is not in good agreement with monte carlo results for any adjustment of the cutoff .",
    "the gaussian approximation gives a much better agreement with monte carlo results .",
    ", width=396 ]    we thus observe that the renormalisations of the quantities @xmath73 and @xmath75 as a function of temperature are _ different _ for large @xmath186 .",
    "although this observation is not essential by itself for the charge sharing mechanism , the numerical simulation shows directly that the renormalisation of @xmath75 is stronger ( see below ) .",
    "the stronger renormalisation of @xmath75 in comparison with @xmath73 should presumably be associated with nearly zero - modes of residual fluctuations which exist around winding number trajectories .",
    "namely , the gaussian fluctuations are stronger around winding number trajectories than around non - winding ( @xmath223 ) trajectory because the square averaged fluctuations for zero modes ( for @xmath224 ) are much stronger @xmath225 than @xmath226 for simple gaussian residual fluctuations .",
    "note that zero - mode fluctuations need to be considered beyond gaussian approximation for @xmath227 , because @xmath228 becomes easily much larger than @xmath229 .",
    "therefore fluctuations beyond logarithmic renormalisations are naturally expected and do occur as seen numerically .",
    "we end with two remarks .",
    "since the temperature dependence of the relative phase correlator at large @xmath35 is not an exponentially small function of temperature , but only a power law , optimising the probability of a charge shared among @xmath106 grains , @xmath230 , gives a temperature dependence of the exponent that is always weaker than arrhenius law , @xmath231 .",
    "thus the temperature dependence of the optimum probability @xmath232 is the soft activation behaviour .",
    "second , it has not escaped our attention that even for @xmath233 , inelastic cotunnelling processes should make the charge sharing possible@xcite .",
