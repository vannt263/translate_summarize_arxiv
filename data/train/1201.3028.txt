    "instantons are solutions of the euclidean equations of motion . as tunneling processes can be considered as propagation in euclidean time , an instanton can describe tunneling transitions that are classically forbidden : for example , gravitational instantons , which are riemannian solutions of the einstein field equations , can describe changes in the topology of space@xcite . in the semiclassical wkb approximation ,",
    "the tunneling amplitude is given by the value of the euclidean action for the instanton .",
    "gravitational instantons have been found that describe the pair production of wheeler wormholes@xcite , and the fragmentation of a single charged @xmath0 universe into multiple , completely disconnected @xmath1 universes@xcite .",
    "but so far , an instanton has not been found that describes a transition between a single - centered black hole configuration to a _ connected _ multi - centered black hole configuration .    in this work",
    "we describe such an instanton , where the single - centered configuration is a charged bertotti - robinson ( br ) universe ( corresponding to the @xmath1 near - horizon region of an extremal reissner - nordstrom black hole)@xcite , as shown in figure [ fig - onethroat ] , and the multi - centered configuration consists of a set of extremal reissner - nordstrom ( ern ) black holes placed at arbitrary locations in an encapsulating br universe , as shown in figure [ fig - twothroat ] ( the multi - centered configuration can also be interpreted as a single encapsulating @xmath1 throat that divides into multiple branches as we move deeper into the throat . ) the total charge of the multi - centered solution is equal to the charge of the single - centered solution .",
    "our instanton differs from the instanton describing the pair production of black holes@xcite , as it describes the splitting of an existing black hole throat .",
    "it also differs from the well - known brill instanton@xcite describing the fragmentation of a single @xmath1 throat into several completely disconnected @xmath1 throats .",
    "brill s instanton describes vacuum tunneling between a single @xmath1 universe , and a set of multiple , disconnected , disjoint @xmath1 universes .",
    "our instanton , on the other hand , describes vacuum tunneling between a single @xmath1 throat ( corresponding to the black hole throat of a magnetically charged ern black hole ) , and a branching @xmath1 throat ( corresponding to the black hole throat of a magnetically charged ern black hole that has split into several throats , the total charge of which is equal to the single throat configuration . )",
    "so the brill instanton can be interpreted as describing the _ fragmentation _ of a single @xmath1 universe .",
    "our instanton can be interpreted as describing the _ splitting _ of a single @xmath1 throat , which nevertheless remains in a single piece at spatial infinity .",
    "thus , our instanton describes the splitting of an ern black hole into multiple black holes , within the _ same _ universe : in contrast to the brill instanton , which describes the fragmentation of one universe into several .",
    "this instanton is analogous to the well - known instanton solution for the symmetric double well in one - dimensional quantum mechanics , as it connects two degenerate vacua .",
    "thus , rather than describing a decay process , this instanton describes quantum _ mixing _ between two vacuum states .",
    "the true ground state will therefore be a quantum superposition of all such configurations , where each configuration satisfies the condition that the sum of the charges of all the black holes is equal to the total charge of the single - centered configuration . calculating the tunneling amplitude between the vacua",
    ", we find that it is equal to half the difference in entropy between the two configurations .",
    "this result agrees with the expectations of @xcite , where it was suggested that the splitting of ern black holes could be exponentially suppressed by a tunneling amplitude proportional to the change in entropy before and after the splitting .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec - scsol ]",
    "we describe the multi - centered black hole solutions . in section [ sec - instanton ]",
    "we find the instanton solution corresponding to tunneling between single and multi - centered configurations . in section [ sec - action ]",
    "we evaluate the euclidean action for the instanton to find the tunneling amplitude .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec - conc ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the black hole solutions that describe the two states connected by our instanton .",
    "these are solutions to the einstein - maxwell equations that describe magnetically charged black holes . in a spacetime with coordinates @xmath2 , the metric and the electromagnetic field strengths are given by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a harmonic function that satisfies @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the laplacian on flat @xmath7 .",
    "this solution describes a bertotti - robinson ( br ) type universe@xcite containing a number of ern black holes .",
    "the black holes may be located at arbitrary coordinate locations @xmath8 .",
    "if there are @xmath9 black holes of charges @xmath10 , then the function @xmath4 has the form : @xmath11 we denote the total charge by @xmath12 .",
    "this solution has a tree - like geometry that is asymptotically @xmath1 at large radius , but then branches into smaller @xmath1 regions at the ern black holes .",
    "the special case when @xmath13 corresponds to a single - centered black hole solution , which is simply an @xmath1 space of charge @xmath14 .",
    "these solutions can also be derived by taking the limit @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the planck length ) of asymptotically flat multi - centered ern black hole solutions with separations of order @xmath17 between the black holes@xcite . as @xmath18 , the asymptotically flat region decouples and",
    "we are left with an encapsulating throat of charge @xmath19 which splits into @xmath9 throats of charge @xmath10 .     bertotti - robinson universe with charge @xmath19 . ]",
    "throat ) containing two extremal reissner - nordstrom black holes of charge @xmath20 and @xmath21 . ]",
    "we want to consider a tunneling process in which a single - centered black hole configuration of charge @xmath19 splits into a multi - centered black hole configuration of charges @xmath22 such that @xmath23 .",
    "this process should be described by a gravitational instanton , which is a solution to the euclidean equations of motion . in order to describe a valid tunneling process@xcite ,",
    "the euclidean action of the instanton should be finite and real .",
    "moreover , we should be able to define a euclidean time coordinate @xmath24 such that slicing up the spacetime into hypersurfaces of constant @xmath24 takes us from an initial hypersurface @xmath25 at @xmath26 to a final hypersurface @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "the induced metrics on @xmath25 and @xmath27 should be real , and correspond to spatial slices of the lorentzian spacetimes that we want to connect via a tunneling trajectory ( in this case , the single - centered and multi - centered solutions . ) in order to allow the euclidean solution to be joined smoothly to the lorentzian solutions across @xmath25 and @xmath27 , the extrinsic curvature @xmath29 should vanish on both surfaces .",
    "our instanton satisfies all of these conditions throat and multiple disconnected @xmath1 throats respectively .",
    "however , it is not then clear how these asymptotic regions can join smoothly onto spacelike hypersurfaces of a lorentzian spacetime .",
    "maldacena , michelson , and strominger ( mms)@xcite attempted to remedy this situation by defining an instanton using different coordinates , with initial and final surfaces of zero extrinsic curvature that corresponded to spacelike slices of a single ads space , and multiple disconnected ads spaces respectively .",
    "however , this result still had several differences from our work .",
    "firstly , of course , the final surface of the mms instanton corresponds to completely disconnected @xmath1 universes , unlike our work where the multiple @xmath1 throats remain connected at the `` top '' of the throat .",
    "secondly , the initial and final surfaces of the mms instanton correspond to spatial slices of _ global _",
    "@xmath1 spacetime , not poincare @xmath1 , as was the case with brill , and as is the case in this paper .",
    "this is an important distinction when it comes to interpreting the instanton as the splitting of the throat of an ern black hole .",
    "secondly , mms assumed ( but did not show ) that the value of the euclidean action for their instanton would be the same as the value brill found .",
    "this might not necessarily be the case , given that mms use a different set of coordinates from brill . ] .",
    "we define initial and final surfaces with zero extrinsic curvature .",
    "the initial surface is reached at @xmath26 and the final surface at @xmath28 , where @xmath24 is a suitably defined notion of euclidean time .",
    "the initial surface is diffeomorphic to the spatial slice of a lorentzian poincare @xmath1 throat , and the final surface is diffeomorphic to the spatial slice of a lorentzian spacetime that is the aforementioned poincare @xmath0 space that splits into multiple @xmath0 spaces further down the throat , but remain joined at the `` top '' of the throat .",
    "it is important that we are considering poincare rather than global @xmath1 space times , as we want to consider the splitting of black hole throats , and the throat of an ern black hole is given by a poincare ads geometry .",
    "since we are dealing with poincare @xmath1 throats at all times , the initial and final surfaces can be thought of as spatial slices through the black hole throats of two different black hole configurations .",
    "the initial surface corresponds to a spatial slice through a single ern black hole throat .",
    "the final surface corresponds to a spatial slice through the throat of an ern black hole that has split into multiple ern black holes further down the throat , but remain connected at the top of the original single throat so that the entire configuration looks like a single ern black hole when viewed from far away .    in order to find the gravitational instanton ,",
    "we first analytically continue the time coordinate to @xmath30 to obtain a solution to the euclidean equations of motion : @xmath31 we then define the coordinate@xcite : @xmath32 finally , we can define the coodinates @xmath24 and @xmath33 ( where in the end , we will take @xmath24 to be our euclidean time coordinate ) : @xmath34 the relation between the coordinates @xmath35 and @xmath36 are shown in figure [ fig - ycutoff ] , where the semicircles represent the hypersurfaces of constant @xmath24 , and @xmath33 is the angular coordinate .",
    "we let @xmath24 take the range of values @xmath37 for some @xmath38 , and we take @xmath33 to cover the range @xmath39 for some infinitesimal @xmath40 .",
    "we have regulated the lower limit of @xmath33 as @xmath41 corresponds to spatial infinity . in the end",
    "we will first take the limit @xmath42 , then @xmath43 .     and @xmath36 .",

    "we can now define the initial and final surfaces of the instanton .",
    "the initial surface @xmath25 is the hypersurface with @xmath44 and @xmath39 , and the final surface @xmath27 is the hypersurface with @xmath45 and @xmath39 .",
    "we now have to show that the induced metric on these surfaces corresponds to spatial slices of the desired initial and final black hole configurations as we take the limit @xmath46 , @xmath43 , and that the extrinsic curvatures on these surfaces is zero .    on the initial surface @xmath25",
    ", we have @xmath47 as @xmath43 .",
    "so we have @xmath48 and the metric ( [ eq - eucmet ] ) becomes : @xmath49 explicit computation shows that the extrinsic curvature on this surface is zero .",
    "we can glue this to a spatial slice of euclidean poincare @xmath1 with charge @xmath19@xcite , which is the initial spacetime we want , by applying the coordinate transformation : @xmath50 the metric on @xmath25 in these coordinates is : @xmath51 the coordinate @xmath52 covers the range @xmath53 .",
    "if we first take the cutoff @xmath46 , then take the limit @xmath43 , this covers the entire @xmath1 space .",
    "we can therefore join @xmath25 smoothly onto a spatial slice of a lorentzian single - centered @xmath1 solution with charge @xmath19 .",
    "the final surface @xmath27 is slightly more complicated .",
    "we first choose a cutoff @xmath54 for the @xmath55-coordinate .",
    "then for the range of coordinates @xmath56 on @xmath27 for some fixed , small @xmath57 , we define the coordinates : @xmath58 this section of @xmath27 corresponds to the blue segment of the hypersurface in figure [ fig - surfaces ] . for fixed @xmath59 , as @xmath60",
    ", we find that @xmath61 in this region .",
    "specifically , the time - component of the metric is @xmath62 , and we have : @xmath63 as @xmath43 , for @xmath64 .",
    "thus the metric on this section of @xmath27 is simply the poincare spatial slice of the full multi - centered solution for the range of coordinates @xmath65 .",
    "explicit computation shows that the extrinsic curvature on this section vanishes .    for the range of coordinates @xmath66 ( corresponding to the red segment of the hypersurface @xmath27 in figure [ fig - surfaces ] ) , if we choose a large enough cutoff @xmath54 , then we are on one of the throats of the multi - centered solution , as we are in the region of large @xmath55 .",
    "thus we have @xmath67 for one of the charges @xmath68 , where we have redefined the coordinate @xmath69 so that the origin is centered at @xmath68 . the metric approaches @xmath70 as @xmath71 .",
    "explicit computation shows that the extrinsic curvature vanishes on this section of @xmath27 . in this region",
    ", we apply the coordinate transformation : @xmath72 note that in the overlap region , @xmath73 , the definitions of the two sets of coordinates ( [ eq - sigmaf1 ] ) and ( [ eq - sigmaf2 ] ) agree in the limit @xmath60 for any fixed cutoff @xmath59 .",
    "the metric on this segment @xmath66 of @xmath27 is , for each throat : @xmath74 this is the poincare spatial slice of an @xmath1 throat of charge @xmath68 .",
    "thus , we find that the blue segment of @xmath27 ( corresponding to @xmath64 ) , can be glued to a spatial slice of a multi - centered solution cut off at @xmath54 , while the red segment consists of the spatial slices of multiple @xmath1 throats attached to the multi - centered solution at the cutoff .",
    "note that the cutoff @xmath59 may be taken to be arbitrarily large .",
    "as with the initial surface @xmath25 , the coordinate @xmath52 covers the range @xmath53 . if we first take @xmath46 , then take @xmath43 , this covers the entire multi - centered solution .",
    "so @xmath27 may be glued to the spatial slice of a multi - centered solution .",
    "is given by the hypersurface @xmath44 , and the final surface @xmath27 is given by the hypersurface @xmath45 . in order to define the coordinate transformation that allows @xmath27 to be glued to a spatial slice of the multi - centered solution",
    ", we define two regions on @xmath27 : the blue region corresponds to @xmath64 , and the red region corresponds to @xmath66 , for some small fixed @xmath57 . ]",
    "we can now evaluate the euclidean action for the instanton .",
    "the action is given by@xcite : @xmath75\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the induced metric on the boundary , @xmath77 is the trace of the second fundamental form of the boundary , and @xmath78 $ ] is a term that depends solely on the induced metric at the boundary . the action can be converted into a pure boundary term@xcite : @xmath79\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is a vector potential defined by : @xmath81    the spacetime is bounded by the following surfaces : the constant @xmath24 hypersurfaces @xmath82 , @xmath39 , the constant @xmath33 hypersurface @xmath83 , @xmath37 , and the constant @xmath33 hypersurface @xmath84 , @xmath37 .    on the first three hypersurfaces @xmath82 , @xmath39 and @xmath83 , @xmath37 , both the extrinsic curvature term and the electromagnetic term in ( [ eq - actionbd ] ) vanish , and thus do not contribute to the euclidean action .",
    "the constant @xmath33 hypersurface @xmath84 , @xmath37 corresponds to the hypersurface @xmath85 , @xmath86 . on this surface",
    ", we find that @xmath87 as @xmath46 , so the two terms cancel , and this hypersurface also does not contribute to the euclidean action .",
    "thus the only non - zero contributions to the euclidean action come from the `` edges '' of the spacetime , at @xmath82 , @xmath84 , and @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "the contribution from the `` edges '' can be calculated using the results in @xcite : the contribution from an edge formed by two boundaries with spacelike normals @xmath88 ( which is the case here , in euclidean spacetime ) is given by : @xmath89 @xmath90 is the area of the edge @xmath91 , which is @xmath92 .",
    "the factor of @xmath93 comes from wick - rotation , and we have defined @xmath94 in this case we have : @xmath95 at all the edges . note that the directions of the normals ( i.e. whether they are inward or outward - pointing ) does not matter , since we can take the branch of arccosh such that @xmath96 whether 0 is approached from above or below .",
    "thus each edge will give a contribution of the same sign .",
    "as with the contribution from the mantle surfaces , we want to normalize the euclidean action so that it is zero when evaluated on a single - centered solution of total charge @xmath14 . without normalizing , the edge terms for such a solution add up to : @xmath97 where the first term comes from the edge @xmath45 , @xmath83 , and the second term comes from the edges @xmath44 , @xmath83 , and @xmath82 , @xmath84 .",
    "so we must subtract @xmath98 to obtain the correct normalization ( this can be done by setting @xmath78 = -\\frac{1}{4 } a_\\infty$ ] . )",
    "this means that the total contribution from the edge terms is : @xmath99 this is equal to half the difference in entropy between the initial and final configurations .",
    "this is different from the value of the euclidean action for brill s instanton , which is equal to the exact difference in entropy between a single @xmath1 throat and multiple completely disconnected @xmath1 throats . in some sense , it can be seen as natural that the probability amplitude for our instanton is half that for the brill instanton , as the instanton in this paper , unlike brill s , connects a single @xmath1 throat to a configuration that branches into several @xmath1 throats at the bottom of the single throat , but remains connected at the top .",
    "therefore , it can be said in some sense that only `` half '' of the original space becomes disconnected in the transition represented by the instanton , so that the corresponding tunneling amplitude is also half that of the process which gives a set of completely disconnected spacetimes .",
    "we have found an instanton that can be interpreted as a tunneling process between a single - centered black hole solution of charge @xmath19 to a multi - centered black hole solution of charges @xmath100 such that @xmath23 .",
    "the amplitude for the tunneling process is equal to half the difference in entropy between the initial and final configurations .",
    "the black holes that we are considering are contained within an encapsulating @xmath1 throat .",
    "thus we may consider them as black holes in a br universe , or alternatively , as an @xmath1 throat that divides into multiple branches as we move deeper into the throat . in the latter interpretation",
    ", our instanton describes the splitting of the throat of an ern black hole by quantum tunneling .",
    "ultimately , it would be desirable to find an instanton that describes the complete splitting of an ern black hole into two or more ern black holes separated by finite coordinate distances in an asymptotically flat space .",
    "our instanton suggests that this process is not forbidden , as there is at least a finite probability for the throat of an ern black hole to split into multiple throats .",
    "i would like to thank frederik denef for helpful discussions on this work , and andrei linde for pointing me towards some useful references .",
