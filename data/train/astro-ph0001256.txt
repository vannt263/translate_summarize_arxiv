    "cluster mergers are the most energetic and common phenomena in the universe .",
    "they are the natural way of forming rich clusters of galaxies within cold dark matter scenarios , which imply a bottom - up hierarchy of structure formation .",
    "cosmological numerical simulations indicate that the matter flows along preferential directions ( defined by filaments or planar structures ) , where the subunits are accelerated to velocities of the order of @xmath3 km s@xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the formation of a rich cluster is expected at the intersections between filaments or walls .",
    "the merging process generates important perturbations in the intracluster medium ( icm ) such as shocks , bulk flows and turbulence in the hot gas ( see for instance roettiger , burns & loken 1996 ) .",
    "the observational signatures of these events are mainly seen in the x  ray band , where they appear as distorted isophotes ( slezak , durret & gerbal 1996 ) or as regions of significantly enhanced temperature outside the cluster centre ( markevitch 1996 ) .",
    "it has also been assumed that these events must significantly affect the emission of the galaxy population .",
    "for instance , in the optical band merging seems to play a role in secondary star formation bursts ( caldwell & rose 1997 )    however , the most spectacular effect of merging is found at radio wavelength .",
    "bulk motions of the icm are invoked to be responsible for bending the wide - angle tail ( wat ) objects ( roettiger , burns & loken 1993 ) and for the formation of the u - shape of narrow - angle tail ( nat ) sources ( bliton et al .",
    "1998 ) , otherwise impossible to be explained in terms of ram pressure for these objects with low peculiar velocities with respect to the cluster centre .",
    "moreover , the bulk motion of the intracluster gas may provide the energy for particle reacceleration as well as additional accretion material for the central engine .",
    "two other classes of merging related radio sources are `` relics '' and `` halos '' .",
    "radio halos are cluster wide radio sources , typically found in the central regions of galaxy clusters .",
    "they usually exhibit a regular morphology and their dimensions may exceed the megaparsec .",
    "relics are preferentially found in peripheral cluster regions , they are usually characterised by an elongated morphology and lack an obvious optical counterpart .",
    "both types of radio sources are characterised by low brightness , steep radio spectra ( @xmath5 @xmath21 , for s@xmath6 ) and are located in clusters showing evidence of a recent merger event ( feretti & giovannini , 1996 ) .",
    "it is now accepted that merging provides at least a large fraction of the energy required to reaccelerate the electrons deposited in the intracluster medium by extended radio galaxies ( blandford & eichler 1987 , sarazin 1999 ) .",
    "the information on the dynamical state of merging clusters is crucial in order to understand how the radio properties of the galaxies and of the clusters are influenced by the merging itself .",
    "however , despite the well established connection between such radio sources and the merging phenomenon , an extensive multifrequency study of merging clusters is still missing .",
    "the cores of rich superclusters are the ideal environments to study the merging phenomenon , since the high peculiar velocities induced by the enhanced local density favours cluster - cluster and cluster - group collisions . among rich superclusters , the shapley concentration stands out for its most extreme properties .",
    "it is the richest nearby supercluster , with 25 member clusters at a density contrast @xmath7 ( zucca et al . 1993 ) , and shows a percentage of interacting clusters a factor of three higher than elsewhere ( raychaudhury et al .",
    "it is therefore a unique laboratory to follow cluster merging and to study its signature in a wide range of astrophysical situations",

    "all flux densities given in table 3 and 4 are corrected for the primary beam attenuation .",
    "integrated flux densities are given for the extended radio sources .",

    "nine of the extended radio sources are doubles .",
    "we found three classical frii radio galaxies , one fri ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) and one head - tail source , and the remaining four have asymmetric radio emission . for double and fr - type radio sources , the position given in table 3 is the barycentre of the radio emission , while for extended and resolved sources we give the position of the radio peak .    adding to the present sample all radio sources in the a3556 mosaic observations ( see paper i ) above 1 mjy ( the same flux density limit ) , we obtain a total of 263 radio sources in the whole a3558 complex .",
    "the total number of resolved radio sources is 31 , i.e. @xmath70 % of the total .",
    "given the much higher optical density in the a3558 complex compared to the background , and the cluster merger occurring in this region , we computed the source counts for our radio sample for comparison with the background counts ( prandoni et al .",
    "1999 ) , in order to study if the dynamical properties of this region result in an enhanced number of radio sources .    due to the primary beam attenuation",
    ", the sensitivity of the fields we surveyed is not uniform ( see section 3 ) , so our sample is not complete to the flux limit of 1 mjy .",
    "therefore in order to carry out a statistical analysis we have selected a complete subsample , which we will refer to as the `` reduced sample '' .",
    "the `` reduced sample '' includes all radio sources published in paper i and in the present paper with s@xmath71 mjy within a distance of 17.5 arcmin from the centre of their field .",
    "at such a distance the primary beam attenuation is reduced by a factor of two , so sources with flux density s @xmath72 mjy are seen as sources with s @xmath73 mjy before the correction .",
    "the total number of sources in the `` reduced sample '' is 145 and the area covered is 3.25 deg@xmath25 .",
    "the resulting logn - logs in the flux density range 1 - 512 mjy is reported in figure [ fig : counts ] , where the differential number of sources in each bin is given in n deg@xmath74 and the errors are poissonian .",

    "the plot in figure [ fig : counts ] clearly shows that the counts in the two samples have the same shape and normalisation , suggesting that the numbers of sources found in the core of the shapley concentration are consistent with those predicted for the background .",
    "the consistency in normalisation between these two distributions also indicates that calibration error residuals in our sample are negligible . in figure",
    "[ fig : counts ] our counts go significantly below the background for s@xmath76 2 mjy , which independently confirms that our sample is incomplete below this limit . at the 2 mjy limit the expected number of radio sources in each field from the prandoni et al . survey ( 1999 ) is 12 .",
    "the maximum number of observed objects is 19 in field # 13 , which shows only a marginal excess , while the minimum is 8 , found in field # 15 , consistent with the expected counts within the errors .",
    "we have quantitatively estimated the similarity between the source counts in the a3558 complex and the background counts applying a ks test to the two distributions , and found that the probability that they are the same distribution is p=0.996 .",
    "this result implies that the major optical overdensity in the core of the shapley concentration is not reflected into an overdensity of the radio sources down to 2 mjy , i.e. logp@xmath58 ( w hz@xmath4 ) = 21.73 .",

    "these two radio galaxies will be presented in further detail in section 7 .",
    "considering that a further two extended galaxies were found in a3556 , i.e. the tailed j1324@xmath03138 ( whose nature was discussed in paper ii ) and the `` mini '' wide - angle tail j1322@xmath03146 ( paper i ) , the total number of the extended galaxies in the a3558 complex is four .",
    "the remaining radio galaxies are point - like , or show only marginal extension .",
    "as clear from table 5 and from paper i , all radio galaxies in the a3558 complex are faint , their power falling in the range logp@xmath58 ( w hz@xmath4 ) = 21.45 - 23.39 , typical of fri objects .",
    "the strongest source is the head tail j1333@xmath03141 .",
    "these values suggest that the dominant mechanism for the radio emission has a nuclear origin .",
    "we point out that the detection limit of our survey , i.e. 1 mjy , corresponds to logp@xmath58 ( w hz@xmath4 ) = 21.42 , assuming an average recession velocity v = 15000 km s@xmath4 for the shapley concentration .",
    "such power is typical of low luminosity radio galaxies ( ellipticals giving rise to fris ) and of the strongest spirals .      in order to explore the dynamical environment around our radio galaxies , we cross correlated our sample with the group list of bardelli et al .",

    "two out of the 28 shapley radio galaxies are located in a region not covered by the three dimensional analysis . among the remaining 26 ,",

    "however three of the five are part of a group just below the significance threshold and group could be considered an extension of the group t599 ( see table 2 in bardelli et al .",
    "we found that the groups richest in radio galaxies are t337 ( corresponding to the main component of a3558 ) , t598 and t599 , both located at the eastern periphery of a3562 .",
    "the numbers of radio galaxies found in these groups are respectively 3 , 3 and 4 .",

    "conversely , it seems that groups in the regions of sc1329@xmath0313 and sc1327@xmath0312 are void of radio galaxies , although the statistics are poor .",
    "it has been suggested ( gavazzi & jaffe 1986 ) that there may be a correlation between the local optical density and the ratio between the radio and optical flux ( rorf ) . in order to check if this behaviour holds also in the a3558 region , we correlated the local optical density obtained with the adaptive kernel method ( bardelli et al .",
    "1998 ) with the rorf for our radio galaxies .",

    "this has been explained by invoking confinement of radiating electrons by the intracluster medium .    in order to see",
    "if any segregation effect in the distribution of the spectral index is present in the shapley concentration , we derived the spectral index @xmath83 for all radio galaxies in the a3558 complex . for this purpose",
    "we used the full resolution 22 cm images ( section 3.1 ) and made 13 cm natural weighted images convolved to the 22 cm hpbw ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "these values are reported in table 5 .",
    "the average value of @xmath83 for those radio sources detected both at 22 cm and 13 cm is 0.79 , well consistent with the typical values for radio sources of this class .",
    "we point out , however , that the presence of six lower limits for @xmath83 ( see table 5 ) , may increase significantly the mean value .",
    "note that among the four extended shapley radio galaxies only the relic source j1324@xmath03138 in a3556 has a steep spectrum ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "we selected all the shapley radio galaxies with @xmath101 ( including the lower limits ) and highlighted them in figure [ fig : wedge ] ( lower panel ) and in figure [ fig : rorf ] .",
    "quite surprisingly , the steep spectrum radio galaxies reside preferentially in low density regions at the border of the a3558 complex .",
    "the only exceptions to this behaviour are the cd galaxy j1327@xmath03129b and j1329@xmath03139 , both in a3558 .",

    "the key question we wish to address is whether the ongoing merging in the a3558 complex has significant influence on the radio emission of the galaxies .",
    "the most direct method is to compute the radio - optical luminosity function for the galaxies in this region and compare it with the mean luminosity functions for cluster galaxies .    in order to compare our radio luminosity function ( rlf ) for the shapley concentration core to the results obtained by ledlow & owen ( 1996 , lo96 hereinafter ) for a complete sample of abell clusters",

    "( 1999 ) concluded that gas stripping due to ram pressure is important in preventing gas supply to the galaxy central regions .    the ideal environment for studying the merging phenomenon is the centre of the shapley concentration .",
    "in particular , evidence has been accumulated that the a3558 complex is at a late stage of the merging of clusters of similar mass ( bardelli et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , our approach is to study the radio emission of galaxies in a place where the existence of a major merging is established .",
    "this is different from the customary approach , where cluster interaction is found a posteriori , after detection of a particular phenomenon .",
    "the results of our atca 22 cm survey of the merging clusters in the a3558 chain clearly indicate that the signature of cluster merging on the radio emitting properties of cluster galaxies and of the clusters themselves is complex .      _",

    "given an optical magnitude , the radio power of the associated radio source does not depend on the local environment .",
    "this is not entirely surprising if we think that low power radio galaxies are almost only found in rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "however , our analysis suggests that not only the local density but also the merging environment plays no role in the radio power distribution of radio sources .    point _ ( 1 ) _ suggests that the dominant source population in our survey is the background , and that the much higher optical density in the shapley concentration core and the ongoing merger is not reflected in a higher density of radio sources . in other words",
    "the shapley concentration would have not been spotted using radio source counts .",
    "the implication of point _ ( 4 ) _ is even more extreme , since it suggests that the probability of a galaxy becoming a radio source with logp @xmath222.5 is _ lower _ in the shapley concentration than in any other type of environment .",

    "( 1999 ) , who compared the radio - optical properties of a merging and a relaxed cluster , both at z@xmath8 0.25 , and concluded that cluster mergers triggers radio emission , both in the form of nuclear emission and of radio emission from starbursts .",
    "the difference in our results suggests that the role of mergers on the radio emission properties of clusters is complex , and a variety of parameters , such as for example stage of merger , impact velocities and timescales , are likely to play a role .",
    "the complexity of the situation also emerges from the fact that despite the above mentioned statistical results , some specific radio properties in the a3558 chain seem to be the signature of cluster or group merger , most remarkably the candidate radio halo at the centre of a3562 and the extended emission around the radio galaxy j1332@xmath03146 .",

    "<S> we present the results of a 22 cm radio survey carried out with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) covering the a3558 complex , a chain formed by the merging aco clusters a3556-a3558-a3562 and the two groups sc1327@xmath0312 and sc1323@xmath0313 , located in the central region of the shapley concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of our survey is to study the effects of cluster mergers on the statistical properties of radio galaxies and to investigate the connection between mergers and the presence of radio halos and relic sources .    </S>",
    "<S> we found that the radio source counts in the a3558 complex are consistent with the background source counts . </S>",
    "<S> the much higher optical density compared to the background is not reflected as a higher density of radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we found that no correlation exists between the local density and the radio source power , and that steep spectrum radio galaxies are not segregated in denser optical regions .    </S>",
    "<S> the radio luminosity function for elliptical and s0 galaxies is significantly lower than than for cluster early type galaxies and for those not selected to be in clusters at radio powers logp@xmath1 @xmath2 22.5 , implying that the probability of a galaxy becoming a radio source above this power limit is lower in the shapley concentration compared with any other environment . </S>",
    "<S> possible explanations will be presented .    </S>",
    "<S> the detection of a head - tail source in the centre of a3562 , coupled with careful inspection of the 20 cm nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) and of 36 cm most observations , allowed us to spot two extended sources in the region between a3562 and sc1329@xmath0313 , i.e. a candidate radio halo at the centre of a3562 , and low brightness extended emission around a 14.96 magnitude shapley galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between these two extended galaxies and the ongoing group merger in this region of the shapley concentration are discussed .    </S>",
