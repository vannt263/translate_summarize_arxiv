    "recently @xcite has used yohkoh , solar heliospheric observatory ( soho ) and transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) observations in the evaluation of coronal heating models for active regions .",
    "he focusses on three main results obtained from aforesaid spacecrafts , namely , the overdensity of coronal loops , chromospheric upflows of heated plasma and the localization of heating in the lower corona .",
    "he examines various a.c . and d.c .",
    "models on the basis of above criteria . in d.c .",
    "models he considers bipolar , tripolar and quadrupolar magnetic reconnection and favours tripolar magnetic reconnection where magnetic reconnection between two polarities of a closed and the unipolar footpoint of an open field line may take place .",
    "such a situation may arise due the emergence of a new dipole in an open field region or by the collision of the footpoint of an open field line with an adjacent dipole . in this case",
    "the open field line can carry hot plasma upward into the upper corona , regardless of the size of the interacting dipole .",
    "thus tripolar reconnection is highly relevant for the coronal heating especially for open field regions such as coronal holes .",
    "+ @xcite have studied transient network brightenings ( blinkers ) and explosive events in the solar transition region , recorded by the coronal diagnostic spectrometer ( cds ) in the line o v @xmath0 630 and solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ( sumer ) instrument in the line si iv @xmath0 1402 together with the photospheric magnetograms taken by the big bear solar observatory videomagnetograph .",
    "they find that the explosive events ( which are features with very broad uv line profile ) tend to keep away from the centres of network brightenings .",
    "cds blinkers contain many small - scale short - lived sumer ` unit brightening events ' having size of a few arc seconds and a lifetime of a few minutes .",
    "each of these unit brightening events is characterized by a uv line profile which is not as broad as those of explosive events .",
    "thus blinkers ( transient network brightenings ) and explosive events both may be due to magnetic reconnection with different geometries .",
    "+ the explosive events are considered to occur as a result of the collision of a network flux thread ( which is part of a very large loop ) and an intranetwork flux thread which is part of a very small loop ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this interaction has therefore the potential for conveying hot plasma into large- scale loops and is a very suitable mechanism for explaining the observed footpoint heating , upflows and overdensity in euv loops .",
    "further , the relaxation of the newly formed open field line may accelerate acoustic waves or shock waves and heat plasma along its passage .",
    "thus the process of tripolar magnetic reconnection has a better connectivity to the upper corona and to the solar wind via the open field line than bipolar and quadrupolar reconnection geometries @xcite .",
    "+ when two open magnetic field lines of opposite polarity reconnect , the newly configured polarities relax into two bipolar field lines .",
    "the lower one connects the two magnetically conjugate photospheric footpoints whereas the upper ends of the disconnected field lines in the upper corona combine and finally move into interplanetary space .",
    "thus there is a high - density closed loop downward and a low - density segment moving upward ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this type of heating process is applicable to big or small flares ( including micro- and nano - flares ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "bipolar magnetic reconnection has been investigated , in some way or other , by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite also . + quadrupolar magnetic reconnection has been observed and modeled in solar flares ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . here",
    "the exchange of connectivity between positive and negative polarities in a system with two closed field lines takes place by pushing them into physical contact such that the new configuration is in a lower energy state .",
    "+ chromospheric quadrupolar magnetic reconnection between two contiguous flux tubes of opposite polarity has been considered by @xcite in connection with its possible relationship to coronal heating .",
    "his basic idea has been that reconnection occurs preferentially where the growth rate of the relevant instability is greatest .",
    "he arrives at the conclusion that quadrupolar magnetic reconnection can lead to coronal heating by joule dissipation and by the generation and subsequent dissipation of high frequency alfvn and magnetoacoustic waves .",
    "the heating of solar wind particles may take place when high frequency alfvn waves , produced during reconnection , are absorbed by cyclotron damping .",
    "+ in view of above it seems quite worthwhile to study magnetic reconnection in tripolar geometry such as that given in fig .",
    "2 we present the relevant theoretical details . the data used and the results obtained , exhibited in  3 , are discussed in  4 alongwith our conclusions . + throughout cgs system of units is used . wherever necessary , the heights are expressed in km .",
    "we adopt the formalism of @xcite . as shown in fig . 1",
    "there is a network flux thread ( part of a very large loop ) which collides with an intranetwork flux thread which is a part of very small loop .",
    "it is assumed that magnetic reconnection would occur preferentially where the growth rate of resistive tearing mode instability is greatest .",
    "the medium under consideration is a partially ionized hydrogen plasma so that the role of helium and other elements may be ignored .",
    "+ the tearing mode growth rate depends on the wave number of the mode .",
    "the wave number of the most rapidly growing mode is given by @xcite    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the width of the reconnecting region and @xmath3 , the transverse magnetic reynolds number , is given by @xmath4    with    @xmath5    and    @xmath6    here @xmath7 is the resistive diffusion time , @xmath8 the alfvn transit time , @xmath9 the alfvn velocity , c the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath10 , the coulomb resistivity of the hydrogenic plasma , is given by @xcite    @xmath11    in equation ( 5 ) , t is the temperature of the hydrogenic plasma .",
    "the alfvn velocity @xmath9 is estimated through the following equation    @xmath12    where the mass density @xmath13 may be obtained from @xmath14    in the above b is the magnetic field strength before reconnection , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the number densities of proton and neutral hydrogen , respectively .",
    "+ the growth time @xmath17 , which is the inverse of the growth rate , is given by    @xmath18    the growth rate of instability depends sensitively upon the assumed width @xmath2 of the current sheet between two flux tubes and it may be related to the pressure scale height h by @xmath19    here @xmath20 is a dimensionless parameter and the scale height @xmath21 is given by @xmath22    with @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the proton mass and @xmath25 the number density of electrons .",
    "the tearing mode instability leads to the formation of small islands which allow for the rapid diffusion of the magnetic field . for the most rapidly growing mode the island length scale @xmath26",
    "is given by @xmath27    if the tearing region is in a dynamic state and the inhomogeneities move at the alfvn speed then they will lead to fluctuations having frequency @xmath28 given by @xmath29    such fluctuations may play a role in providing additional thermal energy to the corona .",
    "+ the average energy dissipation rate in the reconnection region may be obtained from(tandberg - hanssen & emslie 1988 ) @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the volume of the reconnecting region(s ) and @xmath32 , the reconnection time scale , is given by @xcite @xmath33    in the case of multiple reconnecting regions , as in the tearing mode , the volume of reconnecting region may be taken to be @xmath34 , where l is the longitudinal length scale and @xmath2 is the width . as an approximation l",
    "may be taken to be the diameter of the flux tube .",
    "+ it is possible to estimate the minimum strength of the magnetic field required to heat the reconnecting region to coronal temperature ( @xmath35k ) by using the following relation @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the boltzmann constant and n is given by @xmath38    such an estimate can be made at each height where magnetic reconnection can occur .",
    "for the sake of completeness the data taken from cox ( 2000 ) have been exhibited in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "in particular , fig . 2 shows variation of temperature with height in the photosphere - chromosphere region whereas fig .",
    "3 exhibits @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath16 as a function of height h in km .",
    "the data of fig . 2 and equation ( 5 ) have been used to obtain resistivity @xmath10 as a function of height and is displayed in fig .",
    "since the resistivity is inversely proportional to @xmath41 it has maximum value in the temperature minimum region .",
    "the data of figures 2 and 3 together with equations ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) lead to the results displayed in fig . 5 where the scale height h is shown to vary with height in the lower solar atmosphere .",
    "the lowest value of scale height falls in the temperature minimum region .",
    "+ in order to estimate the width @xmath2 of the reconnecting region we require the value of parameter @xmath20 .",
    "this can be done by estimating the length over which the magnetic field will diffuse over a time scale characteristic of changes in the photosphere , e.g. , the mean lifetime of photospheric granules which is 10 minutes ( @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure alongwith equations ( [ eq3 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) , ( [ eq9 ] ) and the data of fig . 2 give @xmath42 corresponding to @xmath43 km and @xmath44 at 520 km .",
    "now equation ( [ eq9 ] ) alongwith the results of fig .",
    "5 may be used to obtain the width @xmath2 of the reconnecting region as a function of height which is displayed in fig .",
    "the nature of variation of width with height is similar to that of scale height vs height curve , as expected .",
    "the evaluation of alfvn transit time @xmath8 requires the values of alfvn velocity @xmath9 and the width @xmath2 . in order to determine @xmath9 we require the magnetic field strength as a function of height ( which is not known ) and the mass density @xmath13 . assuming a constant mean value @xmath45 g , the data of fig . 3 and equation ( [ eq7 ] ) ,",
    "the alfvn velocity has been determined and is displayed in fig .",
    "7 as a function of height .",
    "as expected @xmath9 increases with height because @xmath13 decreases with height .",
    "using the values of @xmath2 and @xmath9 the alfvn transit time becomes known through equation ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "+ with the width @xmath2 and the resistivity @xmath10 known it is possible to determine resistive diffusion time @xmath7 by using equation ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "this enables us to find transverse magnetic reynolds number @xmath3 through equation ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the reynolds magnetic number has been displayed in fig .",
    "8 as a function of height .",
    "the resulting curve shows a minimum near 100 km and increases upwards monotonically .",

    "9 as a function of height . using equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , the values of @xmath46 and width",
    "@xmath2 it is possible to evaluate the wave number @xmath47 of the most rapidly growing mode .",
    "this wave number as a function of height is displayed in fig .",
    "it shows a broad maximum in the 0 - 700 km region .",
    "+ the growth time ( which is the inverse of growth rate ) has been obtained through equation ( [ eq8 ] ) and the already known values of the magnetic reynolds number ( fig . 8) and the resistive diffusion time ( fig . 9 ) .",
    "the growth time @xmath17 and the growth rate are displayed in figures 11 and 12 , respectively .",
    "the growth rate curve shows a maximum at 1800 km and the growth time curve shows a minimum at the same height , as it should .    using equation ( [ eq15 ] ) , the resistive diffusion time t@xmath48 and the alfvn transit time t@xmath49 we obtained reconnection time t@xmath50 which is exhibited as a function of height in fig .",
    "it exhibits a broad minimum in the range 1200 - 1900 km .",
    "it appears that the reconnection is slower in the temperature region and faster in the upper chromosphere .",
    "14 exhibits island length scales @xmath26 as a function of height .",
    "these values have been obtained from equation ( [ eq12 ] ) , the magnetic reynolds number ( fig . 8) and the width @xmath2 of the reconnecting region ( fig .",
    "the shortest length scales are obtained around 1900 km in the upper chromosphere which is a desirable feature for all coronal heating mechanisms @xcite . +",
    "the frequencies of mhd waves generated as a result of fluctuations in the reconnecting region are displayed in fig .",
    "these frequencies increase from temperature minimum region to upper chromosphere , similar to @xcite , monotonically .    using equation ( [ eq14 ] ) , @xmath45 g , @xmath51 cm , the width @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "6 ) of reconnecting region and reconnection time @xmath32 ( fig . 13 ) we estimate the average energy dissipation rate as a function of height . this result is displayed in fig .",
    "16 which shows that the energy dissipation rate increases with height upto 1800 km and falls upwards . .",
    "the peak in dissipation rate agrees with the peak in the growth rate of the tearing mode instability .",
    "the height of peak dissipation rate finds favour with the observation made by @xcite .    in fig .",
    "17 we display the minimum magnetic field strength @xmath52 required to heat the reconnecting site to coronal temperatue @xmath53 as a function of height .",
    "it is clear from this curve that at a height of 1600 km the required minimum magnetic field is about 100 g whereas at a height of 500 km it is about 6000 g. such a possibility is consistent with the evidence for direct heating of chromospheric gas to coronal temperatures @xcite .",
    "the data , namely , temperature @xmath54 , electron , proton and hydrogen number densities @xmath55 and mean lifetime of granules , used by us are of quite recent origin and seem to be reliable .",
    "the temperature minimum occurs near 500 km ( fig .",
    "1 ) . at each height",
    "the number density of neutral hydrogen is greater than the number densities of electrons and protons ( fig .",
    "3 ) . + the classical coulomb resistivity @xmath10 is inversely proportional to @xmath41 consequently it has largest value at that height at which the temperature is minimum .",
    "similar trend is noticeable at other heights ( fig .",
    "+ the scale height @xmath21 and width @xmath2 of the reconnecting region vary with height in the same way . both of them have their minimum values near 500 km .",
    "essentially , the nature of curves of temperature , scale height , width , resistivity is quite similar , as expected .",
    "+ because of decreasing mass density @xmath13 the alfvn velocity increases with height , monotonically as the magnetic field strength @xmath56 before reconnection has been given a fixed value of 100 g. for the better understanding of the coronal heating problem the distribution of magnetic field with height is quite essential .",
    "the magnetic reynolds number determines to what extent the field is frozen into the plasma .",
    "higher values of @xmath3 means better frozen - in - field approximation . in the region under consideration @xmath3 varies from about @xmath57 to @xmath58 , i.e. the frozen - in - field approximation is quite good to describe photospheric - chromospheric region ( fig .",
    "+ the resistive diffusion time @xmath7 varies with height ( fig.9 ) in the same way as the temperature .",
    "it has minimum value near 500 km and lies in the range @xmath59 for the solar atmospheric region under consideration .",
    "+ the wave number of the rapidly growing mode shows a broad peak in the region 0 - 700 km ( fig .",
    "this is because @xmath60 is inversely proportional to the width of reconnecting region which has minimum value in the aforesaid region .",
    "+ the growth time of instability decreases monotonically with height upto 1900 km and increases upwards ( fig.11 ) . since the growth rate is the inverse of growth time hence growth rate exhibits opposite nature ( fig . 12 ) .",
    "the growth rate is maximum at 1800 km consequently heating is expected to occur near this height .",
    "in fact , the energy dissipation rate is maximum at 1800 km ( fig .",
    "thus the growth rate seems to be a better indicator of heating .",
    "further the magnetic reconnection time @xmath32 has minimum value in the 1200 - 1900 km region ( fig.13 ) but the width of the reconnecting region is larger in this region . since the energy dissipation rate varies directly with width and inversely with reconnection time hence the above- mentioned behaviour of dissipation rate",
    "is quite expected .",
    "+ it is clear from fig .",
    "14 that the island length scale has its lowest value at 1900 km .",
    "since smaller length scales are more efficient in energy dissipation than larger length scales hence the above heating rate is in agreement with this well - known result . + the energy dissipation rate ( fig .",
    "16 ) gets support from the minimum magnetic field strength vs height curve ( fig .",
    "17 ) because at 1900 km the required minimum magnetic field strength @xmath52 to heat the chromospheric plasma to coronal temperature is about 100 g. it is this value which has been used to obtain alfvn velocity @xmath9 , alfvn transit time @xmath8 etc . .",
    "+ the frequency of mhd waves , generated due to magnetic reconnection , increases with height ( fig .",
    "since the higher frequency waves may dissipate more readily than the lower frequency waves hence the heating wil be enhanced by the high frequency waves higher up in the atmosphere .",
    "similar conclusion has already been forwarded by @xcite .    in tripolar geometry ( fig .",
    "1 ) a network flux thread which is a part of a very large loop collides with an intranetwork flux thread which is part of a very small loop . at the intersection",
    "point the two flux threads are antiparallel , forming a relative angle that is greater than 90 degree .",
    "consequently the reconnection at the intersection point could produce strong bidirectional outflows ( fig .",
    "this explains explosive events showing high velocity motions in their line profiles",
    ".    the open field line may carry hot plasm upward into the upper corona , regardless of the size of the interacting dipole",
    ". the open field line may also act as a waveguide to send mhd fluctuations into the corona and interplanetary space .",
