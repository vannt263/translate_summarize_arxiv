    "recent experimental progress in flavor physics to look for the effect of new physics requires precise theoretical predictions from the standard model . however , model independent calculation of hadronic matrix elements is difficult because of nonperturbative nature of qcd .",
    "the lattice qcd simulation is one of most promising approaches in which the systematic uncertainties can be reduced systematically @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal of this work is to construct a framework for lattice calculations of hadronic matrix elements in a few percent systematic accuracy , as required by the experiments in progress .",
    "more practically , the level of accuracy requested from the cleo - c experiment @xcite as well as from the b factories @xcite are about 2 % .",
    "this paper intends to propose a systematic program to achieve this accuracy making use of the anisotropic lattice qcd .    in a lattice calculation of heavy quark systems such as the charm and bottom",
    ", one needs to control the large discretization error of @xmath6 .",
    "extensive studies in various approaches have achieved much progress in understanding the heavy quark systems .",
    "however , it still seems difficult to achieve aforementioned systematic accuracy with the current techniques for several reasons .",
    "here we categorize them into three types and summarize their advantages and disadvantages from the viewpoint of precision study of matrix elements in flavor physics .",
    "_ 1 ) effective theories . _",
    "one approach is to use descriptions of the heavy quark based on the heavy quark effective theory using nonrelativistic qcd @xcite . as an advantage ,",
    "the action incorporates higher order correction in spatial momenta and can easily remove the all the mass dependent errors at the tree or one - loop level . however , since the theory does not have the continuum limit , one can not remove the discretization errors by extrapolating the results on lattices with finite spacings .",
    "another disadvantage is that the nonperturbative renormalization is difficult due to strong mass dependence .",
    "precise measurements of the weak matrix elements for the heavy - light mesons below 10% are therefore difficult .",
    "_ 2 ) relativistic framework .",
    "_ the most straightforward approach is to use the @xmath0 improved wilson action in natural way for relatively lighter heavy quark , and to extrapolate the results in @xmath7 according to the heavy quark effective theory . since the theory has the continuum limit , the discretization errors can be removed by an extrapolation .",
    "the perturbative errors can also be avoided by employing the nonperturbative renormalization . in practice , however , lattice artifacts of @xmath8 give dominant errors @xcite so that the precise calculation will remain difficult for the next few years even in quenched approximation .",
    "brute force improvement by decreasing lattice spacing and employing large lattices quickly increase the simulation cost , and therefore not a realistic solution for the calculation of matrix elements .",
    "_ 3 ) fermilab approach .",
    "_ the fermilab approach links the above two approaches @xcite . in the heavy quark mass region ,",
    "the @xmath0 improved wilson action with asymmetric parameters is reinterpreted as an effective theoretical description just like the nonrelativistic qcd action . since the action reduces to the conventional @xmath0 improved wilson action for small masses @xmath9 , it has in principle smooth continuum limit .",
    "the disadvantage is that it is not known how to extrapolate the results on lattices with @xmath10 , which are currently unavoidable in particular for systems with @xmath11-quark .",
    "for such a quark mass region , a mass dependent tuning of parameters in the action is required for proper improvement , although a systematic tuning beyond the perturbation theory is still a challenge @xcite .",
    "therefore precise calculation below 10% level are nontrivial for the weak matrix elements of the heavy - light mesons .    therefore , it is desirable to develop a new framework for the heavy quark with the following features .",
    "( i ) the continuum limit can be taken ; ( ii ) a systematic improvement program , such as the nonperturbative renormalization technique @xcite , can be applied not only to the parameters in the action but also to the operators ; ( iii ) a modest size of computational cost is required for systematic computation of matrix elements .    the anisotropic lattice , on which the temporal lattice spacing @xmath12 is finer than the spatial one @xmath13 , is a candidate of such a framework @xcite .",
    "the approach is fundamentally along the line of fermilab approach on the anisotropic lattice .",
    "however , large temporal lattice cutoff is expected to improve the above problems drastically .",
    "the most crucial one is that the mass dependence of the parameters in the action may become so mild in the region of practical interest that one can adopt the @xmath0 improving clover coefficient determined in the nonperturbative renormalization technique .",
    "on the other hand , standard size of spatial lattice spacing keeps a total computational cost modest .",
    "therefore , extrapolation of the result to the continuum limit may be possible with keeping systematic uncertainties under control with sufficient accuracy .",
    "whether these observations practically hold should be examined numerically , as well as in the perturbation theory .",
    "our form of quark action on the anisotropic lattice is founded in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the perturbative results for light and heavy quarks and the simulation results of the light quark were studied . in this paper , we focus on the heavy quark and study the mass dependence of the the lorentz symmetry breaking effect in order to understand the mass range for which a consistent description is possible .",
    "this signals the applicability of anisotropic lattice to the heavy quark systems .",
    "we investigate the heavy - heavy and heavy - light mesons on a quenched lattice of anisotropy @xmath2 and spatial cutoff @xmath14 gev .",
    "the heavy quark mass is varied from the charm quark mass to about 6 gev to examine an applicability of the action to these systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we first give our quark action , which is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "we then give our conjecture on the lattice spacing dependence of the anisotropy parameter toward the continuum limit , and discuss the advantage of the anisotropic lattice compared to the isotropic one . in section  [ sec : expectation ] , we observe the tree - level expectation of the mass dependence of the @xmath15 terms in the quark dispersion relation and study how the anisotropic parameters or the breaking effect of relativity behave as a functions of the heavy quark mass . section  [ sec : simulation ] describes the numerical simulation .",
    "we compute the heavy - light and heavy - heavy meson spectra and dispersion relations with two sets of heavy quark parameters . in one set ( _ set - i _ ) , the bare anisotropy is set to the value for the massless quark .",
    "the other set ( _ set - ii _ ) adopt the result of the mass dependent tuning using the heavy - heavy meson dispersion relation as obtained in ref .",
    "we observe the mass dependence of the renormalized anisotropy in order to probe the breaking of relativity for heavy quark .",
    "we also observe how the inconsistency among the binding energies of heavy - heavy , heavy - light and light - light mesons @xcite grows as a function of mass .",
    "the last part of this section discusses the hyperfine splitting of the heavy - light meson . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we summarize the result of simulation , and draw our perspective on further development of this framework , as our conclusion in this paper .",
    "we adopt the following quark action in the hopping parameter form @xcite : @xmath16 @xmath17   \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\hspace{-0.8 cm }      -   \\kappa_{\\sigma } \\sum_{i }           \\left [ ( r\\!-\\!\\gamma_i ) u_i(x ) \\delta_{x+\\hat{i},y }     + ( r\\!+\\!\\gamma_i)u_i^{\\dag}(x\\!-\\!\\hat{i})\\delta_{x-\\hat{i},y } \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\hspace{-0.8 cm }      -   \\kappa_{\\sigma } c_e               \\sum_{i } \\sigma_{4i}f_{4i}(x)\\delta_{x , y }      - r \\kappa_{\\sigma } c_b                \\sum_{i > j } \\sigma_{ij}f_{ij}(x)\\delta_{x , y } ,   \\label{eq : action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the spatial and temporal hopping parameters , and are related to the bare quark mass and bare anisotropy as given below .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is the spatial wilson coefficient , and the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the clover coefficients for the @xmath0 improvement .",
    "although the explicit lorentz symmetry is not manifest due to the anisotropy in lattice units , it can be restored in principle for physical observables in physical units at long distances up to errors of @xmath15 by properly tuning @xmath23 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 for a given @xmath18 .",
    "the action is constructed in accord with the fermilab approach @xcite and hence applicable to an arbitrary quark mass , although a mass dependent tuning of parameters is difficult beyond the perturbation theory .",
    "this may be circumvented by taking @xmath24 , with which the mass dependence of parameters are expected to be small so that @xmath0 symanzik improvement program for the heavy quark can be applied . to study whether this expectation really holds or not is the main subject of this paper .    in present study , we vary only two parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 with fixed other parameters .",
    "we set the wilson parameter as @xmath27 and the clover coefficients as the tadpole - improved tree - level values , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the tadpole improvement @xcite is achieved by rescaling the link variable as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with the mean - field values of the spatial and temporal link variables , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . instead of @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ", we introduce @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath36 the former controls the bare quark mass and the latter corresponds to the bare anisotropy .           on an anisotropic lattice , one must tune the parameters so that the hadronic states satisfy the relativistic dispersion relations . in general , the lattice dispersion relation for arbitrary values of @xmath37 is described in lattice units as @xmath38 in the above expression the energy @xmath39 and the rest mass @xmath40 are in temporal lattice units while the momentum @xmath41 is in spatial units .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 introduced in this equation characterizes the anisotropy of the quark fields .",
    "the difference between the quark field anisotropy @xmath42 and the gauge field anisotropy @xmath5 probes the breaking of relativity .",
    "therefore , the calibration is nothing but the tuning of @xmath43 for a given @xmath34 so that @xmath42 equals @xmath5 and hence the relativistic dispersion relations are satisfied .",
    "let us call the tuned parameter as @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 depends on the quark mass and can in general be different from unity even for the case of isotropic lattice .",
    "the requirement of the relativity relation automatically enforces that the rest and kinetic masses are equal to each other . in this sense ,",
    "our calibration procedure of anisotropic lattice action is a natural generalization of the fermilab approach .",
    "now we consider the tuning of anisotropic parameter either on isotropic or anisotropic lattice , for fixed physical quark mass .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath46 can be tuned using the dispersion relation of either heavy - heavy or heavy - light meson in mass dependent way .",
    "alternatively , one can also adopt the value tuned for the light - light mesons neglecting the mass dependence .",
    "these procedures of calibration can give different results due to the discretization errors .",
    "we would like to know : 1 ) the value of lattice spacing @xmath47 above which the calibrated parameters @xmath45 using the heavy - heavy and heavy - light mesons differ from each other by more than a certain accuracy @xmath48 ( say , 2% ) , and 2 ) the value of lattice spacing @xmath49 above which the calibrated parameters @xmath45 using the heavy - light and light - light mesons are different by more than a certain accuracy @xmath50 .",
    "naively speaking , the difference between @xmath45 s with heavy - heavy and heavy - light mesons originates from the @xmath51 effects , where @xmath52 is the typical quark momenta in heavy - heavy meson , @xmath53 . on the other hand ,",
    "the deviation of @xmath45 with heavy - light mesons from the @xmath45 with light - light mesons is due to the @xmath54 effects . with the criteria that these errors stay within the required accuracies , we obtain @xmath55    figure  [ fig : conjecture ] conjectures the expected behavior of the tuned anisotropy parameter @xmath45 for the isotropic ( @xmath56 ) and anisotropic ( @xmath2 ) lattices .",
    "the tuned anisotropy normalized by the value at massless limit is displayed for fixed physical quark mass , around charm quark mass , as an example . in the case of isotropic lattice , as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : conjecture ] , @xmath57 is expected to hold . in this case , for a sufficiently small lattice spacing @xmath58 , both the heavy - heavy and heavy - light mesons can be successfully described by setting the anisotropy parameter to the value in the massless limit . for a coarser lattice spacing @xmath59 , mass dependent tuning , namely the fermilab approach , is necessary , but the description of both the heavy - heavy and heavy - light mesons still works . for an even coarser lattice spacing @xmath60 , simultaneously consistent description of heavy - heavy and heavy - light mesons no longer works , because of severe discretization effect in the heavy quarkonia .",
    "now let us consider the anisotropic lattice case with @xmath2 .",
    "the expected mass dependence of @xmath45 is schematically represented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : conjecture ] . as is obvious in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_crit ] ) and will be studied in the following sections , the anisotropy does not improve the situation for heavy - heavy meson .",
    "therefore @xmath47 remains roughly of the same size as in the isotropic lattice case . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_crit ] ) and the studies in the following sections show that for @xmath2 , @xmath49 is expected to increase and @xmath61 occasionally holds .",
    "this latter situation is particularly probable for quark with not very large mass , and expected to hold up to the bottom quark mass region . in this case , for sufficiently small lattice spacing @xmath62 , both the heavy - heavy and heavy - light mesons can be successfully described by setting the anisotropy parameter to the value in the massless limit . for a coarser lattice spacing @xmath63 consistent description of heavy - heavy and heavy - light mesons",
    "no longer works .",
    "nevertheless the heavy - light meson is successfully described with the anisotropy parameter tuned for the massless limit . finally for an even coarser lattice spacing @xmath64 , the genuine fermilab approach ,",
    "namely mass dependent tuning of @xmath37 , is required to describe the heavy - light mesons .    in the range of lattice spacing @xmath58 , if we give up the description of heavy quarkonia and only consider the heavy - light systems , one can successfully adopt the tuned value of @xmath37 at the massless limit .",
    "this is the most important region for our approach , since there the mass dependence of parameters in the action other than @xmath46 , such as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are also expected to be small , and hence the result of tuning at the massless limit is also considered to be valid . for the tuning of clover coefficient for the massless quark , it may be possible to apply the nonperturbative renormalization technique @xcite , which is currently most efficient procedure to remove the @xmath0 effect beyond perturbation theory .",
    "the most advantage of the anisotropic lattice is that this region @xmath65 is expected to be extended by a factor @xmath5 as is found in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_crit ] ) , so as to cover the heavy quark mass region of practical interests .",
    "therefore the anisotropic lattice is a candidate of framework for heavy - light systems , which satisfies the required characters ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) mentioned in the introduction . also for heavy - heavy systems",
    ", it would be important to study quantitatively the heavy quark mass at which the action starts to fail in correct description .",
    "this paper is dedicated to a numerical study whether these expectations actually holds .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_crit ] ) , similar expectation can be deduced for the heavy quark mass dependence with a fixed lattice spacing . in this paper , since we work with only one lattice spacing , instead of studying the lattice spacing dependence with a fixed heavy quark mass , we study the mass dependence with a fixed lattice spacing .",
    "this means to specify in which region considered above the present @xmath13 is located for each value of quark mass .",

    "now we summarize the result for the _ set - ii_. the heavy - heavy meson satisfies the relativity relation by definition .",
    "however , the heavy - light meson dispersion relation violates the relativity relation so that @xmath84 deviates from unity toward smaller value as heavy quark mass increases .",

    "the @xmath127 rapidly deviate from zero for the heavy quark mass larger than our lightest one .",
    "this is consistent with the above observation of @xmath42 .",
    "these results indicate that for @xmath131 the present action fails to describe the dynamics of heavy quarkonium , and can not be reinterpreted by the subtraction of quark mass effect .",
    "thus we need to either give up to apply the present framework for such a quark mass region , or to improve the action by incorporating higher order correction terms .",
    "the remaining part of this section therefore focus on the heavy - light meson spectrum .",
    "now we turn our attention to the heavy - light meson , which is of our main interest . according to the heavy quark expansion , the spin flipping interaction of heavy quark in the heavy - light systems is of @xmath132 , and hence the hyperfine splitting of mesons is proportional to the meson mass at the leading order . in the heavy - light systems ,",
    "the large mass of heavy quark is not important for the dynamics . employing the fermilab formulation ,",
    "this character is taken into account and the the correct heavy quark expansion is in terms of kinetic mass @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hyperfine splitting , which is measured as the difference of rest masses , are expected to be reciprocally proportional to the kinetic meson mass .",
    "if this is the case , _ set - i _ and _ set - ii _ should show the similar behaviors , up to the @xmath15 systematic uncertainty .",
    "the hyperfine splitting @xmath133 is displayed in figure  [ fig : hfhl ] .",
    "the horizontal axis is spin averaged kinetic meson mass inverse in physical units defined through the hadronic radius @xmath101 . since the most serious uncertainty in the kinetic mass is from the systematic uncertainty in @xmath42 , we estimate this error as @xmath134 where @xmath108 , and hence it does not include the statistical errors of @xmath42 and @xmath78 .",
    "on the other hand , the error associated to the hyperfine splitting is the statistical one .",
    "although the data shows a linear dependence in the heavy quark mass region , there appears small negative intercept .",
    "we regard this small discrepancy with the heavy quark expansion as the lorentz symmetry breaking effect brought in the meson dispersion relation and of @xmath15 . for fixed physical quark mass ,",
    "this effect is expected to disappear linearly in @xmath135 toward the continuum limit .",
    "the results of _ set - i _ and _ set - ii _ clearly show similar behavior , and therefore the above interpretation of fermilab formulation works well up to the relativity breaking effect represented by @xmath136 . for more quantitative analysis",
    ", one must quantify the size of @xmath15 systematic errors and observe how they disappear toward the continuum limit .",
    "this is out of the scope of this paper .    .",
    "the error in @xmath137 is the systematic one estimated from the discrepancy of @xmath42 from pseudoscalar and vector mesons.,width=332 ]",
    "in this paper , we investigated an applicability of the anisotropic lattice quark action in heavy quark mass region , on the quenched lattice with @xmath14 gev and renormalized anisotropy @xmath2 .",
    "the anisotropy is expected to extend the region in which the parameters in the action tuned for massless quark are applicable to precision computations of heavy - light matrix elements . for this purpose",
    ", we measured the heavy - heavy and heavy - light meson masses and dispersion relations to observe the relativity breaking effect .",
    "the calculation was carried out for two sets of parameters , _ set - i _ and _ set - ii_. _ set - i _ adopts the values at the massless limit , while in _ set - ii _ the bare anisotropy is tuned using the heavy - heavy mesons .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "\\(a ) in the quark mass region @xmath138 , the observed fermionic anisotropy @xmath42 s are consistent for heavy - heavy and heavy - light mesons as well as for _ set - i _ and _ set - ii _ parameters within 2 % accuracy .",
    "this implies that present framework is applicable to both these systems even without tuning of anisotropy parameter . beyond this region",
    ", the action fails to describe the heavy quarkonium state correctly , as expected from the tree level analysis of the quark dispersion relation .",
    "\\(b ) the mass dependence of the renormalized anisotropy for the heavy - light mesons with @xmath97 at the massless limit ( _ set - i _ ) is so small that one can exploit the massless tuning in the region of @xmath139 with less than 2% errors .",
    "this result is essentially important for our strategy , since it implies that the parameters tuned at the massless limit is directly available for this mass region , which already contains charm quark mass with the present lattice and can be extended to the bottom quark with development of computational resources in successive decade .",
    "\\(c ) for @xmath140 , relativity breaking effect in the heavy - light mesons seems to grow as a function of the heavy quark mass .",
    "this is signaled by the discrepancy of @xmath42 s from the pseudoscalar and vector mesons , although the present statistics is not enough for a quantitative estimate of this effect . in the scaling of hyperfine splitting",
    ", we also found small discrepancy with the expectation from the heavy quark expansion , which is considered as @xmath15 systematic effect .",
    "it is important to quantify these effects and to observe how they disappear toward the continuum limit , for future high precision computations with this approach .",
    "we therefore conclude that the anisotropic lattice quark action satisfies the required characters ( i)(iii ) for high precision calculations of heavy - light matrix elements mentioned in introduction . among above results , the small mass dependence of anisotropy parameter is in particular quite encouraging for further development of the framework in this direction .",
    "one of the promising strategies is to calibrate the parameters in the action at the massless limit and use them for all masses .",
    "this should work perfectly for @xmath141 which is already sufficient to describe the @xmath142 meson systems .",
    "if one wants to treat @xmath143 meson systems , one has to work with heavier quark , @xmath144 , in which case the mass dependent errors can not be neglected . however , since the mass dependence is small , it can be interpreted as an @xmath15 error and can be removed by taking the continuum limit .",
    "alternatively , one can also apply the genuine fermilab approach for the bottom quark . in this case , the mass dependences of the renormalization coefficients are the source of systematic errors",
    ". nevertheless , as long as one obtains such coefficients nonperturbatively in the massless limit first , and use the one - loop perturbation theory only to compute the mass dependent corrections , the perturbative error can be much better controlled compared to the fermilab approach on the isotropic lattice .",
    "the nice agreement between the observed @xmath42 and the tree level expectation suggest that this idea is also promising in the bottom quark mass region .    on the other hand",
    ", present level of systematic errors as well as the statistical one is not sufficient for these ends . as a most significant example",
    ", one need to eliminate the @xmath145 error using nonperturbative renormalization technique in the massless limit @xcite , and confirm that this suffices also for heavy quark mass region treated in this paper .",
