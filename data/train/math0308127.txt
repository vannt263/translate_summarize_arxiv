    "an example is the following result , whose proof closely follows  @xcite*theorem  3.3.1 .",

    "we can not resist the temptation of repeating the main steps of the proof of theorem  [ thm : thomas ] , since they show a strong relation to groups acting on rooted trees :    define inductively the groups @xmath131 , for ordinals @xmath16 , by @xmath132 ; @xmath133 , in which @xmath131 embeds as @xmath134 ; and for limit ordinals @xmath16 , @xmath135",
