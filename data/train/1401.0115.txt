    "one important observation regarding the macrostate dynamics is that the change of local mean field is usually much slower than the convergence of local macrostate @xmath75 to its local equilibrium @xmath56 .",

    "the following equation shows the exponential rate of convergence of @xmath75 : @xmath79    the largest eigenvalue is @xmath80 .",

    "after the scaling , the first term is diffusive since @xmath97 is the continuum approximation of the laplace operator on rgg network acting on @xmath91 .",
    "the second term @xmath98 is the local reaction term .",
    "though classified rigorously , it is non - local as defined in reaction - diffusion system , it represents a reaction in local neighborhood @xmath99 .",
    "the adiabaticity of the dynamics implies that the diffusion is much slower than the local reaction .",
    "we can obtain an approximated ode for slow time scale dynamics in a closed form by estimating @xmath100 by its local equilibrium @xmath101 .",

    "( [ slow ] ) provides clear differentiation between dynamics in our model and in the voter model , the majority game and the glauber ordering .",
    "taking a similar approach , we find that the voter model on rgg is purely diffusive , i.e. the reaction term is 0 . for the glauber ordering , the reaction term is @xmath103 in which @xmath104 is the inverse of temperature and @xmath105 is the interaction intensity .",
    "[ reaction_term ] shows the reaction term @xmath106 for the voter , ng , and glauber ordering ( go ) at different temperatures .",
    "the majority game , ng , and glauber ordering at zero temperature have reaction terms with the same equilibria and stability ( @xmath107 stable , @xmath62 unstable ) .",
    "thus , the mean - field solutions of these models behave similarly .",
    "however , at the level of the discrete model , the ng on rgg will always go to a microstate corresponding to some stationary mean - field solution , while glauber ordering at zero temperature on rgg may get stuck in one of many local minima of its hamiltonian .     for voter , ng and glauber ordering ( go ) at different temperatures.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=75.0% ]",

    ", @xmath110 is a constant defined by the average degree @xmath9 . in * methods * , we provide a heuristic argument and using the perturbation method prove this relation for the mean - field equation , i.e. the case when @xmath111 .",
    "this behavior is common for many reaction - diffusion systems and it is qualitatively the same as the behavior of glauber ordering at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "following the rule of boundary evolution minimizes the length of the domain boundary .",
    "a direct consequence of this fact is that if any stationary solution exists , its boundaries must be all straight ( geodesic ) , confirming our conclusion about the stationary solutions found in the previous paragraph .",
    "since global topology is irrelevant to our derivation , this relation applies also to other two - dimensional manifolds .",
    "the manifold considered here is the torus embedded in 2d euclidean space .",
    "however , for the standard torus embedded in 3d euclidean space , the topology is the same but metrics are not , hence the geodesics are different .",
    "therefore , there are quite different and more complicated stationary solutions there .",
    "another example is the sphere in 3d space . on the sphere ,",
    "the only inhomogeneous stationary solution consists of two hemispherical opinion domains , because the great circle is the only closed geodesic on a sphere .",

    "a committed agent is one who keeps its opinion unchanged forever regardless of its interactions with other agents .",

    "a critical fraction of committed agent @xmath130 is found for ng - lo on complete graph which is also relevant here . in our setting ,",
    "a fraction @xmath131 of agents are committed to opinion a , and all other agents are uncommitted and hold opinion b. the macrostate with committed agents is still defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqn_macro ] ) , but the definition of local mean field @xmath92 is replaced by    @xmath132    generally , @xmath131 can vary on the x - y plane , but we only consider the case that @xmath131 is a constant , i.e. the committed agents are uniformly distributed .",
    "then we reanalyze the stationary solution .",
    "firstly there is a critical committed fraction @xmath133 which is exactly the same as that on complete graph . when @xmath134 , the only stationary solution is @xmath135 and it is stable .",
    "when @xmath136 , there are three solutions , of which two @xmath135 , @xmath137 are stable , and the third @xmath138 is unstable . besides there is a class of stationary solutions when the committed fraction is below the critical .",
    "they are analogues of the stripe - like solutions in the non - committed agent case .",
    "the evolution of the boundary can be interpreted as a mean curvature flow .",
    "in such view , the fraction of agents committed to a opinion exert a constant pressure on the boundary surface from the side of a opinion domain .",
    "similarly , agents holding opinion b exert a pressure from the side of b opinion domain .",
    "so the stationary solution will contain opinion domains in the form of disks with critical radius @xmath139 for which the pressure arising from the curvature offsets the pressure from the committed fraction ; thus we have @xmath140 .",
    "this type of stationary solutions are unstable , the round disk of the opinion domain will grow when @xmath141 and will shrink when @xmath142 . in the first case ,",
    "when the typical length scale of opinion domains grows beyond @xmath143 , the system will achieve consensus very quickly .    on the basis of the above stability analysis",
    ", we then analyze the dependence of the consensus time on the system size @xmath10 , the committed fraction @xmath131 , and the average degree @xmath122 , and show our conclusions are consistent with the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ committed2 ] which for a given fraction @xmath110 ( @xmath144 in the figure ) depicts the time for @xmath110-consensus in which at least fraction @xmath110 of agents hold the same opinion .",
    "the time to achieve @xmath145consensus is independent of @xmath10 both according to the mean field prediction and numerical plots .",
    "when @xmath134 the dynamics will converge to its unique local equilibrium @xmath146 at all locations simultaneously .",
    "the consensus in this case is close to that on the complete network , especially when @xmath122 tends to infinity . in the opposite case , when @xmath136 , the process to consensus is twofold - before and after the a opinion domain achieves the critical size @xmath143 .",
    "after this criticality , the process is just the extension of the opinion domain driven by the mean field eq .",
    "( [ eqn_macro ] ) .",
    "this stage is relatively fast and the consensus time is dominated by the duration of the other stage , the one before the criticality , in which the dynamic behavior is a joint effect of the mean field and the random fluctuation we neglect in mean field analysis . assuming the dynamics was purely driven by the random fluctuation , the typical length scale of opinion domains would have the scaling @xmath147 at the early stage ,",
    "hence the time scale of this stage would be @xmath148 , i.e. @xmath149 . if the dynamics was purely driven by the mean field , the a opinion domain would never achieve the critical size .",
    "the actual dynamics behavior is in between the two extreme cases .",
    "when @xmath122 decreases , the fluctuation level relative to the mean field becomes higher , leading to faster consensus . in fig .",
    "[ committed2 ] , linear regression for the data points @xmath150 gives @xmath151 in which @xmath152 for @xmath153 respectively , where @xmath154 is the value corresponding to the purely random extreme case .",
    "two observations here may have meaningful sociological interpretation :    \\(1 ) when @xmath123 , for both @xmath136 and @xmath134 , the dynamics behavior converges to that on the complete networks , though the rgg itself may be far from the complete network ( with @xmath5 kept constant , the diameter of the rgg network is much larger than 1 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) when @xmath136 , committed agents are more powerful in changing the prevailing social opinion on rggs with low average degree .",
    "it is similar to the result of the previous study@xcite on the social dynamics on sparse random networks but the `` more powerful '' is in a different sense meaning not the smaller tipping fraction ( with longer consensus time ) , but the shorter time to consensus .     for @xmath155-consensus for ng on rgg with different fractions ( @xmath131 ) of committed agents with direct simulation on networks with average degrees",
    "@xmath156 , and network sizes @xmath157 .",
    "the solid black curve shows the mean field prediction of ng on the complete network(cn ) as the limit case when @xmath123 .",
    "the slope of the red data points near @xmath133 is -2.19.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=80.0% ] +",
    "on rggs , the average degree of an agent @xmath158 is an important structural parameter which also strongly impacts the local dynamic behavior .",
    "there are two critical values of @xmath122 : one is for the emergence of the giant component , @xmath159 @xcite ; the other one , @xmath160 , only applicable for finite - size networks , is for the emergence of the giant component with all vertices belonging to it . in this paper , we only considered the case when @xmath122 is above the critical value @xmath161 so that the network is connected @xcite .    we mainly focused on analyzing the mean - field equation of the ng dynamics on rgg .",
    "we predicted a number of behaviors , including the existence of metastable states , the two - time - scale separation , and the dependence of the boundary propagation speed on the boundary curvature .",
    "we demonstrated in detail that the evolution of the spatial domains for the two - word lo - ng is governed by coarsening dynamics , similar to the broader family of generalized voter - like models with intermediate states @xcite .",
    "however , there are still some behaviors that can not be explained by the mean - field equation , such as : ( _ i _ ) in the large @xmath6 limit , the scaling of correlation length is not @xmath8 as on the 2-@xmath162 regular lattice , but @xmath163 ; ( _ ii _ ) the propagation speed increases along with the average degree @xmath122 and its upper - bound is the mean field prediction , i.e. , the @xmath164 case .",
    "so the major limitation of the mean - field equation derived from the geographic coarsening approach is that it neglects the fluctuation among replicas ( see * methods * ) and loses the information about @xmath122 .",
    "the dependence of the dynamics on @xmath122 is left for further study .",
    "first , we provide the equation for the evolution of microstate @xmath165 . denote the probabilities for @xmath15 taking values @xmath35 , @xmath62 , @xmath113 as @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , respectively . the master equation for spin @xmath15",

    "<S> detailed instances are shown in supplementary table .    </S>",
    "<S> consensus formation in the original ng ( and its variations ) on various regular and complex networks have been studied @xcite . in particular , the spatial and temporal scaling properties </S>",
    "<S> have been analyzed by direct simulations and scaling arguments in spatially - embedded regular and random ( rgg ) graphs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicated @xcite that the consensus formation in these systems is analogous to coarsening @xcite . in this paper , we further elucidate on the emerging coarsening dynamics in the two - word lo - ng on rgg by developing mean - field ( or coarse - grained ) equations for the evolution of opinions . </S>",
    "<S> our method of relating microscopic dynamics to macroscopic behavior shares similar features with those leading to effective fokker - planck and langevin equations in a large class of opinion dynamic models ( including generalized voter models with intermediate states ) @xcite .    a random geometric graph ( rgg ) , also referred to as a spatial poisson or boolean graph , models spatial effects explicitly and therefore is of both technological and intellectual importance @xcite . in this model , each node is randomly assigned geographic coordinates and two nodes are connected if the distance between them is within the interaction radius @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> another type of network with geographic information is the regular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> fundamental models for opinion dynamics on regular lattice has been intensively studied @xcite . in many aspects , </S>",
    "<S> opinion dynamics behaves similarly on rggs and regular lattices with the same dimensionality , but in our study , we also observe several differences . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the length scale of spatial coarsening for large @xmath6 is @xmath7 on rgg while it is @xmath8 on regular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , concerning the spatial propagation of opinions in social systems or agreement dynamics in networks of artificial agents , random geometric graphs are more realistic for a number of reasons : ( _ i _ ) rgg is isotropic ( on average ) while regular lattice is not ; ( _ ii _ ) the average degree @xmath9 for an rgg can be set to an arbitrary positive number , instead of a small fixed number for the lattice ; ( _ iii _ ) rggs closely capture the topology of random networks of short - range - connected spatially - embedded artificial agents , such as sensor networks .    </S>",
    "<S> an important feature of the ng which makes it different from other models of opinion dynamics , e.g. , voter model , is the spontaneous emergence of clusters sharing the same opinion . </S>",
    "<S> generally these opinion clusters are communities closely connected within the network . </S>",
    "<S> this feature of the ng can be used to detect communities of social networks @xcite . for the ng on random geometric graph concerned in this paper , the clusters form a spatial structure to which we refer to as _ opinion domains _ and which are geographic regions in which all nodes share the same opinion . </S>",
    "<S> a number of relevant properties of the ng on random geometric graph have been studied by direct individual - based simulations and discussed in @xcite , such as the scaling behavior of the consensus time and the distribution of opinion domain size . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to these previous works , here we develop a coarse - grained approach and focus on the spatial structure of the two - word lo - ng , such as the correlation length , shape , and propagation of the opinion domains .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we provide the mean - field ( or coarse - grained ) equation for the ng dynamics on rgg . by analyzing the mean - field equation </S>",
    "<S> , we list all possible stationary solutions and find that the ng may get stuck in stripe - like metastable states rather than achieve total consensus . </S>",
    "<S> we find significant two - time - scale separation of the dynamics and retrieve the slow process governed by reaction - diffusion system . using this framework , we identify similarities and differences between ng and other relevant models of opinion dynamics , such as voter model , majority game and glauber ordering .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we present the governing rule of the opinion domain evolution , that in the late stage of dynamics , the propagation speed of the opinion domain boundary is proportional to its curvature . </S>",
    "<S> thus , an opinion domain can be considered as a mean curvature flow making many results of the previous works applicable here @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally we investigate the impact of committed agents . the critical fraction of committed agents found in the case of the ng on complete graph is also present here . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the dependence of the consensus time on the system size , the committed fraction and the average degree . </S>"
