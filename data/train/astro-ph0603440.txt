    "observations of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) indicate that they divide into two classes ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "grbs of one class are of relatively long ( @xmath2 sec ) duration and have softer spectra .",
    "long - soft grbs occur in star forming galaxies with high redshift @xmath3 ( van paradijs et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and their association in several cases with type ibc sne ( @xcite ) suggests that they are the result of core collapse sn explosions of massive stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second class of grbs have short duration ( @xmath4 sec ) and harder spectra .",
    "afterglows of short - hard grbs ( shbs ) have only recently been observed ( e.g. , gehrels et al . ; @xcite ; bloom et al .",
    "@xcite ; berger et al .",
    "@xcite ; fox et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and this has led to the first identifications of shb host galaxies .",
    "in contrast to long grbs , shbs were found to occur in at least some cases in elliptical galaxies with very low star formation rates ( sfrs ) , of order @xmath5 .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the progenitors of shbs are also massive stars , since these have very short ( @xmath6 ) life times .",
    "the gravitational wave ( gw ) driven merger of a double neutron star ( dns ) may lead to a shb ( goodman 1986 ; paczyski 1986 ; eichler et al .",
    "@xcite ; narayan , paczynski & piran @xcite ) .",
    "if the time - lag @xmath7 between dns formation and the merger is large ( comparable to a hubble time ) , it forms a natural explanation why shbs occur in galaxies where the sfr is very low .",
    "we consider two formation mechanisms for dnss .",
    "if two massive stars are born as a binary system , a dns may form after the super nova ( sn ) explosion of both components ( `` primordial '' dnss ) .",
    "population synthesis models of massive binaries yield typically short merger times ( @xmath8 ) , implying that the shb @xmath3-distribution function ( df ) closely follows the sfr history ( e.g. , bloom , sigurdsson & pols @xcite ; belczynski et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the kick - velocity of the dns is low ( @xmath9 ; dewi , podsiadlowski & pols @xcite ) , and the spatial distribution of shb mergers should follow the light distribution of their host galaxy ( portegies zwart & yungelson @xcite ; bloom et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is that at the moment of star formation the neutron stars ( nss ) are _ not _ in the same binary system , but one of the nss is in a binary with a low mass main sequence ( ms ) star . in globular clusters ( gcs ) ,",
    "such binaries are likely to have an exchange interaction with a single neutron star ( sigurdsson & phinney @xcite ; efremov @xcite ; grindlay , portegies zwart & mcmillan @xcite , hereafter gpzm06 ) , and thus form dnss .",
    "a significant fraction ( @xmath10 ) of all ns mergers in the universe may stem from such dynamically formed systems ( gpzm06 ) .    for exchange interactions to occur",
    ", the stellar density must be very high .",
    "the delay time for dynamically formed dnss is therefore mainly determined by the time until core - collapse ( cc ) of gcs , which is typically comparable to the hubble time (  [ s : tau ] ) .",
    "we show that the predicted @xmath3-df of shbs is different for primordial and dynamically formed dnss , so that future @xmath3 observations may determine which formation channel ( if any ) is dominant . to date , the few shbs with @xmath3-detection favor dynamical formation , although possible biases and small number statistics make a final conclusion at this point impossible (  [ s : nz ] ) .",
    "we discuss our results in ",
    "[ s : discussion ] .",
    "the delay time @xmath7 is a sum of the time @xmath11 until the dynamical formation of a dns during core - collapse , and the time @xmath12 until the dns merges . here",
    "we determine the resulting delay function @xmath13 of dynamically formed dnss .",
    "gpzm06 performed scattering experiments with scatter3 and sigma3 in the starlab environment ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "@xcite ) to determine the cross - section for the formation of ns binaries when a ns interacts with a ( ns , ms ) binary .",
    "we use the orbital parameters of the resulting binaries to determine the resulting df of gw merger times @xmath14 , which was found to be well fitted by @xmath15 .",
    "typical merger times @xmath12 are very short compared to the hubble time .",
    "the dns formation rate per gc can be estimated as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the number density of ns stars , @xmath18 is the velocity dispersion , and @xmath19 is the number of progenitor binaries containing one ns ( gpzm06 ) . since @xmath20 , dnss form when the gc is very dense , i.e. , during the cc phase .",
    "the delay between the formation of the gc and the shb is the sum of the delay time @xmath12 and the time @xmath11 between formation of the gc and cc .    for the df of cc times we make the following assumptions : the cc times of the gcs in our galaxy are representative for the whole universe ; the relation between @xmath11 and the half mass relaxation time is only a function of concentration , and it is well approximated by the relation given by quinlan ( @xcite ) ; the formation rate of gcs is proportional to the total sfr .",
    "we ( conservatively ) neglect repeated phases of cc ( `` gravothermal oscillations '' ; sugimoto & bettwieser @xcite ; makino @xcite ) , which would lead to even lower redshifts .",
    "we use the half - mass relaxation times given by harris ( @xcite ) to find the cumulative df @xmath21 for gcs with cc times smaller than @xmath11 ( fig . [",
    "f : tcc ] ) .",
    "the time @xmath11 for a gc between formation and cc is somewhat uncertain .",
    "results in the literature for single mass systems without binaries agree approximately ( e.g. , quinlan @xcite ; joshi , nave & rasio @xcite ; baumgardt @xcite ) .",
    "a spectrum of masses can significantly decrease @xmath11 ( grkan , freitag , & rasio @xcite ) , while primordial binaries increase @xmath11 ( fregeau et al .",
    "the estimate by quinlan ( @xcite ) leads to most gcs having @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ f : tcc ] ) , consistent with the observation that most @xmath23 gcs in the galaxy have not yet experienced cc .",
    "the probability function of the total time @xmath24 to be in the interval @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 the resulting delay function is shown in figure ( [ f : delay ] ) ; we weighed the cc times by the gc luminosity .",
    "since the gw inspiral time df diverges towards small times , @xmath13 is mostly determined by the df of of cc times .",
    "it is also shown in fig .",
    "( [ f : delay ] ) that the delay time df @xmath13 is not modified significantly by choosing @xmath11 which is smaller than that of fig .",
    "[ f : tcc ] by a factor of 10 .",
    "this demonstrates the robustness of the conclusion that for dynamical dnss , the delay times are comparable to the hubble time .",
    "in contrast to the delay function for primordial dnss , we find that _ the delay function of dynamically formed dnss grows with the delay time_. for delay times shorter than 10 gyr , the average delay time is @xmath27 .",
    "we derive the predicted @xmath3-df of shbs , which depends on the event rate of shbs as a function of @xmath3 , the luminosity df of shbs , the delay function , and the detection threshold .      for dns mergers ,",
    "the _ intrinsic _ ( as opposed to observed ) shb rate is given by the convolution of the star formation rate @xmath28 with the distribution @xmath29 of time delays ,    @xmath30\\ ] ]    ( e.g. guetta & piran ( @xcite [ hereafter gp05 ] ; nakar , gal - yam & fox @xcite ) ; @xmath31 is the age of the universe as function of @xmath3 .",

    "we follow the procedure outlined in guetta , piran & waxman ( @xcite ) .",
    "we consider a broken power law peak luminosity function ( lf ) with lower and upper limits , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a normalization constant .",
    "this is the  isotropic - equivalent \" lf , i.e. it does not include a correction factor due to beaming .",
    "following schmidt ( @xcite ) we approximate the effective spectral index in the observed range of 20 or 50kev to 300 kev as @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , and we use @xmath44 ( gp05 ) .",
    "both values are chosen such that even if there are bursts less luminous than @xmath45 or more luminous than @xmath46 they will be only very few ( less than about 1% ) of the observed bursts outside the range @xmath47 .",

    "we estimate that @xmath37 for swift is similar to that for batse , @xmath63 , based on the observation that the detection rate of grbs by swift ( @xmath64 ) is similar to that of batse ( taking into account the different field of views and the fact that batse was triggering only 1/3 of the time ) , and that the fraction of shbs is similar for both batse and swift . fig .",
    "( [ cdf ] ) shows a comparison between the observed and the expected integrated @xmath3-df of shbs for the different models listed in table (  [ t : fit ] ) .",
    "our model for dynamical dns mergers fits the observed shbs much better than the model for primordial dnss ( see the results of kolmogorov - smirnoff [ ks ] tests in table [ [ t : fit ] ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that ruling out a primordial binary @xmath3-df may be premature based on current data . for swift , only 1/3 of detected shbs have secure @xmath3 determinations .",
    "if there is a bias against obtaining a secure redshift for higher @xmath3 bursts , the observed distribution would be shifted , compared to the expected distribution , to low @xmath3 .",
    "assuming , for example , that obtaining a secure @xmath3 requires a higher @xmath37 compared to that required for detection , the lower rate of detection of shbs with secure @xmath3 is accounted for by choosing @xmath65 ( which reduces the detection rate by a factor of 3 compared to that obtained for @xmath66 ) .",
    "indeed , inspection of the 15 to 150  kev peak fluxes of swift shbs shows that the average peak flux of shbs with @xmath3 is higher than that of shbs without @xmath3 ( @xmath67 for grbs 050509 , 050724 and 051221 compared to @xmath68 for grbs 050911 , 051105 , 051114 , 051210 and 051227 ; barthelmy et al .",

    "choosing @xmath65 , the expected @xmath3-df of primordial binary mergers is marginally compatible with observations ( see table  [ t : fit ] and fig .  [ cdf ] ) .",
    "the time delay distribution @xmath13 expected for dynamical dnss yields a @xmath3-df compatible with observations for both choices of @xmath37 .",
    "we have shown ( fig  [ tdelay ] ) that the @xmath3-df of shbs expected from _ dynamical _ formation and subsequent merger of dnss is markedly different from that expected from primordial dns mergers ( assuming @xmath69 ) .",
    "the large time for core collapse shifts the df of dynamically formed dns mergers to low @xmath3 .",
    "the observed @xmath3-df of shbs strongly favors that expected for mergers of dynamically formed dnss , as compared to that expected for primordial dns mergers ( fig  [ cdf ] and table  1 ; see also gp05 and nakar et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "however , current data do not allow to rule out a @xmath3-df consistent with that expected for primordial dns mergers , since redshifts were obtained only for a minority of the detected shbs .",
    "this may be due to a bias against obtaining redshift information for high @xmath3 ( faint ) shbs ( fig  [ cdf ] , table  1 and discussion at the end of  3.3 ) .",
    "future observations should allow to better constrain the @xmath3-df of shbs , and thus to differentiate between models .",
    "for example , detection of only a few high redshift ( @xmath70 ) shbs would severely constrain the contribution of dynamically formed dnss .",
    "if the formation rate of primordial and dynamically formed dnss are comparable ( gpzm06 ) , there will be an anti - correlation between @xmath3 and off - set of the shb from the center of its host galaxy , because dnss formed in gcs will be closer in @xmath3 , but farther away from their host center , since gcs reside in the halos of galaxies .",
    "the large time delay also implies that more dns mergers will be observed by ligo and virgo ( nakar et al .",
    "@xcite )    an alternative method for constraining the progenitors of shbs is to consider their demography ( gal - yam et al @xcite ; zheng & ramirez - ruiz @xcite ) .",
    "zheng & ramirez - ruiz ( @xcite ) showed that in order to account for the preponderance of shbs in elliptical galaxies , the delay times should be large , following @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "this method , which does not rely on the observed @xmath3-df , also indicates delay times longer than expected for primordial binaries .",
    "we note that the specific frequency of gcs ( number of gcs per unit luminosity in the v - band ) is larger for elliptical galaxies than for spirals ( e.g. harris @xcite ) by an order of magnitude .",
