    "spallation sources can be well adapted to accommodate innovative neutrino experiments . at such installation",
    "large amounts of neutrinos are produced from the decay of pions , i.e. @xmath0 and the subsequent decay of muons @xmath1 ; while , due to the strong anti - pion absorption in the spallation target , very few electron anti - neutrinos evolve via the charge - conjugate pion decay sequence ( typically at the level of 10@xmath2 ) .",
    "spallation sources have already been used in the past to study neutrino oscillations by the lsnd  @xcite and karmen @xcite collaborations at lansce in los alamos and isis at rutherford appleton laboratory respectively .",
    "the lsnd ( karmen ) experiment has used a 167 ( 65 ) tons scintillator detector located at about 17 ( 17.6 ) meters from the lansce ( isis ) source . in parallel the same experimental setups have been exploited to perform a variety of experiments including measurements of neutrino scattering on @xmath3c  @xcite @xmath4c , and @xmath5fe  @xcite as well as electroweak tests ( lepton flavor universality  @xcite , v - a structure in muon decay  @xcite , weinberg angle @xcite ) and lepton - flavor violation searches  @xcite .",
    "new spallation sources are being constructed , are planned or under study including the spallation neutron source ( sns ) facility at oak ridge  @xcite , the european spallation source ( ess ) facility in lund , the japanese spallation neutron source ( jsns ) at jparc  @xcite and the spl at cern  @xcite .",
    "they will offer the possibility to realize a low energy neutrino physics program of interest for particle physics , neutrino astrophysics and nuclear physics .",
    "[ fig : flux ]    the only technical alternative to produce controlled neutrino fluxes in the 100 mev energy range is a low energy beta - beam facility  @xcite , which is based on the novel method of the beta - beams  @xcite exploiting the beta - decay of boosted radioactive ions .",
    "while the main goal of the beta - beam is the search of cp violation in the lepton sector , the physics program of the low energy variant covers a variety of interesting topics in nuclear physics , in the study of fundamental interactions and core - collapse supernova physics ( for a review of beta - beams see  @xcite ) .",
    "an advantage of the beta - beam facility is in its capacity to produce collimated beams of both @xmath6 and @xmath7 species , as well as the possibility they provide to control the average energy of the neutrino beams . on the other hand spallation sources have significantly larger neutrino production rates .",
    "determination of neutrino cross sections in a broad range of energies ( several hundred mev to multi - gev range ) is currently the focus of several experiments including miner@xmath8a  @xcite and sciboone  @xcite .",
    "note that recently the miniboone results revealed an excess of the electron - like events for the several hundred mev neutrino energy range  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino scattering experiments that can be performed at spallation sources , where the electron neutrino energy distribution is described by the michel spectrum with the endpoint at about 52.8 mev ( figure  [ fig : flux ] ) , turns to be complementary , as they test nuclei at low energy . in the high ( low )",
    "energy range the nucleon ( nuclear ) degrees of freedom are involved .",
    "the neutrino low energy range is particularly attractive for timely applications , such as the precise calibration of neutrino detectors for the future observation of neutrinos from a core - collapse supernova explosion , or of the diffuse supernova neutrino background .",
    "while electron anti - neutrinos can be detected through proton scattering in water cherenkov and scintillator detectors , neutrino - nucleus scattering is necessary for the identification of the electron neutrinos .",
    "neutrino detectors running or under study exploit nuclei .",
    "for example , a lead - based supernova observatory  the halo project ",
    "is now planned at snolab .",
    "it has been shown e.g. in  @xcite that the measurement of neutrino - scattering on lead , in coincidence with ( 1 or 2 ) neutrons , has an interesting sensitivity upon the third neutrino mixing angle .",
    "large - size detectors , such as glacier or memphys ( uno , hyper - k ) and lena , are currently under study  @xcite . in these observatories the @xmath6 of the diffuse supernova neutrino background can be measured through scattering on argon  @xcite , on oxygen and on carbon  @xcite",
    ". measurements of neutrino - nucleus cross sections are not only necessary to determine precisely detectors responses but for several other applications . in",
    "@xcite an original strategy for the detection of relic galactic supernova neutrinos is proposed , based on the geochemical measurement of @xmath9tc in @xmath10mo ore . as pointed out in  @xcite a precise measurements of the @xmath8-@xmath10mo and @xmath8-@xmath9tc cross sections is necessary to extract unambiguously the supernova contribution . neutrino - nucleus cross sections on stable and radioactive nuclei are one of the observables needed to understand stellar nucleosynthesis and , in particular , the r - process ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "unravelling its site is one of the major open questions in nuclear astrophysics , one of the candidates being core - collapse supernova explosions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a precise knowledge of the nuclear response to neutrinos is also crucial in order to calibrate some phenomenological ingredients ( e.g. knowledge of the forbidden multipoles and their possible quenching ) of the microscopic approaches currently used to study neutrinoless double - beta decay  @xcite .",
    "the observation of neutrinoless double - beta decay would represent a major discovery , from which key information on the cp majorana phases , on the electron neutrino effective mass and mass hierarchy can be extracted @xcite .",
    "however this requires reducing the current discrepancies among the half - life predictions . in this respect a step forward can be made through neutrino - nucleus measurements , combined with other measurements on the candidate emitters ( beta - decay , muon capture , charge - exchange reactions and the two - neutrino double beta decay ) @xcite .    the theoretical description of neutrino - nucleus cross sections in the low energy range benefits from a variety of sophisticated models , including effective field theories  @xcite , the continuum random - phase - approximation ( crpa )  @xcite , the quasi - particle rpa ( qrpa )  @xcite and projected qrpa  @xcite , relativistic rpa  @xcite , the shell model ( sm )  @xcite and the shell model in the complex energy plane  @xcite .",
    "regardless the high degree of sophistication achieved , important discrepancies remain between the predicted neutrino - nucleus cross sections .",
    "for example , in  @xcite it is shown that the calculations of the energy dependent cross section on @xmath5fe differ as much as by factor 3 - 4 at a given energy , whereas the convoluted neutrino cross sections turn to be in agreement with the experimental data  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite the comparison of the flux - averaged neutrino - lead cross sections , associated to supernova neutrinos , show very similar discrepancies .",
    "the realization of precise measurements of the neutrino scattering cross sections for an ensemble of nuclei therefore should help to pin down differences among the models , enabling accurate and reliable description of the isospin and spin - isospin nuclear response .",
    "this is indeed a mandatory step for many innovative and timely applications .",
    ".comparison of characteristics of the past , present , and future spallation source facilities in different regions of the world[t : facilities ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      finally let us discuss the case of @xmath11 scattering .",
    "if the amount of anti - neutrinos is as low as expected at the sns facility , namely @xmath12 , one could use this very pure source of neutrinos to search for rare processes such as the lepton - flavour - violating decay @xmath13 .",
    "this search has been performed , e.g. by the karmen collaboration , giving the current best limit for the branching ratio of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "table [ t : rates3 ] gives the expected @xmath11-p scattering rates assuming that as many @xmath11 as @xmath15/s are produced , these numbers must be scaled according to the suppression factor , that depends on the specific spallation source considered .",
    "this experiment requires a precise identification of the associated events , measuring the neutron through neutron capture on gadolinium or on protons .",
    "new spallation source facilities are under construction , planned or under study",
    ". they will produce an intense flux of neutrinos .",
    "if these facilities are designed to accommodate a neutrino detector(s ) close to the source , they will offer an unique opportunity to perform low energy neutrino scattering experiments .",
    "neutrino detectors with different active material can be used to perform neutrino nucleus cross section measurements that have a variety of innovative and timely applications going from nuclear physics to neutrino astrophysics .",
    "neutrino - nucleus scattering data would create conditions for the breakthrough of the theoretical models , permitting to pin down some of their phenomenological ingredients . besides , physics beyond the standard model can be tested through the searches for non - standard contributions to neutrino electron scattering ; while the identification of electron anti - neutrino scattering on protons can be used to improve established limits on rare lepton flavor violating decays , in particular @xmath16 .",
    "we have presented new predictions for these processes and emphasized some general aspects , hoping one day such measurements to be realized .        c.  athanassopoulos _ et al . _",
