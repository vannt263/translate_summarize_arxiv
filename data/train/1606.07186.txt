    "a superconformal algebra in four dimensions is specified by the number of supercharges , @xmath8 .",
    "theories with @xmath9 have been studied extensively in the last few decades , and played essential roles in the development of field theories .",
    "@xmath0 theories , however , had not attracted much attention until quite recently .",
    "a reason for this is that the only @xmath0 multiplet of free fields is the vector multiplet , which has the same contents as the @xmath1 vector multiplet , and if we try to make an @xmath0 theory in a perturbative way we always end up with an @xmath1 theory .",
    "this means if there exist genuine @xmath0 theories they should necessarily be strongly coupled .",
    "this is consistent to the fact that the absence of marginal deformations in @xmath0 theories @xcite .",
    "an explicit construction of @xmath0 theories was recently proposed by garca - etxebarria and regalado in @xcite theories by using ads / cft correspondence . ] .",
    "they realize @xmath0 theories on a stack of d3-branes by performing a @xmath10 orbifolding that project out one of four supercharges on the d3-branes .",
    "such an orbifold can be defined by combining @xmath11 symmetry of type iib supergravity @xcite and a rotation of the transverse space @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath11 is broken by the quantization of @xmath13 string charges down to a discrete subgroup depending on the value of the complex field @xmath14 . for generic @xmath15",
    "the subgroup is @xmath16 and then the orbifolded theory is still @xmath1 , while for some special values @xmath10 with @xmath17 are unbroken and then we can define genuine @xmath0 theories .",
    "the resulting orbifolds , which we call s - folds following @xcite , are labelled by two integers @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; @xmath18 is the order of the orbifold group and @xmath19 is a divisor of @xmath18 related to the discrete torsion . therefore ,",
    "the theory on the d3-branes are labeled by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath20 is the number of mobile d3-branes .",
    "aharony and tachikawa @xcite listed the dimensions of the coulomb branch operators in these theories .",
    "in particular , they contain an operator with dimension @xmath21 , which becomes @xmath22 or @xmath23 for some of the theories .",
    "aharony and evtikhiev showed in @xcite that the dimensions of coulomb branch operators in a genuine @xmath0 theory must be equal to or greater than @xmath24 .",
    "this was confirmed for rank-@xmath22 @xmath0 theories in @xcite .",
    "this fact implies that the @xmath0 theories with @xmath25 or @xmath23 are in fact @xmath1 theories @xcite , which can be specified by giving the gauge group @xmath26 . in @xcite",
    "some bps states were identified with @xmath27 bps w - bosons , and the gauge groups were determined ( table [ n4list ] ) .",
    ".theories in which @xmath0 is enhanced to @xmath1 are shown . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     substituting ( [ ppqq2z ] ) into ( [ qfqs2 ] ) we obtain @xmath28,\\quad q_2^{(o)}=\\frac{1+i}{2}[(p_1-q_2)+i(p_2+q_1)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these are similar to ( [ qfforso5 ] ) and only difference up to unimportant signatures are the extra factors @xmath29 . therefore , the quantization and constraint for @xmath30 can be obtained from the previous ones by simply rotate the lattice in figure [ lat ] by @xmath31 degrees and expand it by the factor @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting lattice is the same as figure [ ox ] .",
    "if we set @xmath33 the charges @xmath30 take the form @xmath34 , and @xmath35 can be expressed as @xmath36 this is the constraint ( [ attachable ] ) for o3@xmath37-plane .",
    "we can also set @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath39 can be expressed as @xmath40 this is the constraint ( [ attachable ] ) for @xmath41-plane . these two assignments of @xmath42 give two @xmath43 theories with different @xmath44-angle , which are dual to each other .",
    "in both cases , the spectrum of the central charge @xmath2 in the s - fold matches completely with that of the orientifold .    once we obtain these relations , we can rewrite @xmath3 as a function of the s - fold variables . for the @xmath7 matching with ( [ so5zy ] ) and ( [ qfqs1 ] ) and the @xmath43 matching with ( [ sp2zy ] ) and ( [ qfqs2 ] ) we obtain @xmath45 the overall sign depends on the choice of string orientation and",
    "is the matter of conventions .",
    "this result is the same as ( [ z3olz ] ) up to sign .    as in the @xmath46 case",
    "let us illustrate the junctions corresponding to strings in s - fold .",
    "strings connecting two independent d3-branes give w - bosons and they have been already analyzed above , and here we focus on strings connecting a d3-brane and one of its mirror branes .",
    "first we consider two strings @xmath47 these are shown in figure [ z4wall.eps ] ( a ) in a situation with @xmath48 .",
    "the dyonic charges of these strings are @xmath49 by the relation ( [ qfqs1 ] ) we obtain the charges of the corresponding junctions : @xmath50 junctions carrying these charges are shown in figure [ z4wall.eps ] ( b ) .",
    "as in figure [ wall.eps ] the red and blue junctions in figure [ z4wall.eps ] ( b ) are holomorphic and anti - holomorphic , respectively .",
    "another pair of two strings in s - fold is @xmath51 we can easily check that these strings carry dyonic charges that are as @xmath29 times as those in ( [ z4juncq1q2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding junctions are ones in figure [ z4wall.eps ] ( b ) with charges multiplied by @xmath29 .      for @xmath53",
    "we expect @xmath1 sym with the gauge group @xmath54 .",
    "the discrete torsion group for @xmath53 is trivial , and an arbitrary pair of the dyonic charges @xmath55 is allowed . the central charge @xmath2 is given by @xmath56 although no perturbative realization of @xmath54 theory is known in string theory and we can not directly read off the other central charge @xmath3 from junctions , it is natural to guess from the results for @xmath57 that @xmath58 up to overall phase . indeed , if we assume    * @xmath2 is given by ( [ zqzz ] ) , * @xmath3 is a holomorphic bilinear form of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "namely , @xmath3 is given by @xmath61 with some coefficients @xmath62 , and * @xmath63 for charges satisfying the electric condition ( [ electric ] ) ,    then ( [ olzqz ] ) is the unique solution up to phase ambiguity .",
    "in the previous sections we show that there are two types of @xmath64 bps junctions : holomorphic and anti - holomorphic ones .",
    "they may decay or make the transition between two types of bps states as we move d3-branes . in this section",
    "we demonstrate how this happens for some junctions .",
    "the purpose of this section is not to give a comprehensive analysis of general junctions but simply to show typical processes that occur for simple junctions when we move d3-branes .",
    "thus , we consider only strings in s - folds that are shown in figure  [ wall.eps ] and figure  [ z4wall.eps ] .",
    "let us consider @xmath4 case first .",
    "as a starting point we take the red string and junction in figure  [ wall.eps ] , which are also shown in figure [ moduli.eps ] .",
    "case are shown .",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 , and the origin are fixed and @xmath67 and @xmath68 moves .",
    "walls , regions , and a typical example of wall crossing are illustrated . ]    as we previously mentioned the junction is holomorphic . let @xmath69 be the intersection point of the junction .",
    "if @xmath69 coincide @xmath70 , @xmath68 , or @xmath66 , the junction decays into a pair of strings .",
    "let us first consider the wall with @xmath71 .",
    "because the angles at the junction point are all @xmath72 , @xmath73 is equivalent to @xmath74 using ( [ z1z2byy1y2 ] ) we can rewrite this as the following relation between @xmath67 and @xmath65 : @xmath75 which means @xmath67 is an internally dividing point of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "if we illustrate relative position of d3-branes in the s - fold so that the position @xmath65 is fixed , this gives a wall of the transition on the @xmath67-plane .",
    "the other two walls @xmath78 and @xmath79 are given respectively by @xmath80 these three walls form the triangle with vertices at @xmath65 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , which is shown as purple dashed lines in figure  [ moduli.eps ] ( a ) .",
    "the corresponding walls in the flat background are shown in ( b ) by the same color of dashed lines .",
    "when @xmath68(@xmath67 ) crosses these walls the junction decays into two strings ( see ( b-2 ) in figure  [ moduli.eps ] ) .",
    "let us continue the deformation .",
    "when @xmath81 all d3-branes in the flat background are aligned on a line , and then the relation @xmath82 holds , which means d3-branes in the s - fold are on a circle .",
    "( see orange dashed lines and @xmath83 in figure  [ moduli.eps ] . )",
    "nothing special happens on this locus .",
    "as @xmath67 goes further away from the origin , finally , it crosses the walls defined by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is , again , real positive .",
    "these walls are shown as green dashed lines in figure  [ moduli.eps ] .",
    "note that these equations also represent that @xmath65 is on a side of the triangle @xmath67 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "after the crossing the pair of strings form an anti - holomorphic junction .",
    "( see ( b-5 ) in figure  [ moduli.eps ] . )",
    "having illustrated the walls , it is clear that the gray regions in figure  [ moduli.eps ] are regions where the junctions can not be sustained , hence , they are regions of non - bps states .",
    "the other regions are ones of holomorphic or anti - holomorphic bps states .",
    "let us move on to @xmath5 case as another example .",
    "we look into the red string and junction illustrated in figure  [ z4wall.eps ] .",
    "there are two different points compared to @xmath4 case .",
    "one is that the flat background in @xmath4 case is replaced by the orientifold .",
    "the other is that the angles at the junction point are not all @xmath72 but @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath89 .",
    "by taking these into account we can easily determine the walls , and the results are illustrated in figure  [ z4moduli.eps]-pronged junctions in the orientifold . ] .",
    "s - fold is shown .",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 , and the origin are fixed and @xmath67 and @xmath68 moves . in the shaded regions the junction becomes non - bps . the d3-brane motion shown by dashed arrows",
    "cause a deformation of the junction similar to what shown in figure [ moduli.eps ] .",
    "some string configurations in the motion along solid arrows are shown on the right . ]",
    "let us follow a typical motion of d3-branes .",
    "we move the d3-brane at @xmath67 with @xmath65 kept intact .",
    "if we move @xmath67 outward as shown in figure  [ z4moduli.eps ] ( a ) by the dashed arrow , the deformation of the corresponding junction is quite similar to that of @xmath4 case , and we do not repeat the analysis for it .",
    "we comment on another type of wall that we do not meet in the @xmath4 case .",
    "it is illustrated as light - blue lines in figure  [ z4moduli.eps ] .",
    "let us move d3-branes following the solid arrows in the figure . in ( b )",
    "we show both the junction and its mirror image by the reason which will become clear shortly . on the light - blue line",
    "each of the junction and its mirror becomes a pair of strings as in ( b-2 ) .",
    "if the brane pass through the light - blue line two strings ending on @xmath68 and @xmath90 form a new junction .",
    "although the topology of the junction changes in this process the junction keeps itself holomorphic .",
    "in this paper we investigated junctions in s - folds for the purpose of understanding the supersymmetry enhancement proposed by aharony and tachikawa .",
    "we determined the spectrum of dyonic charges of the theory from the information of junctions in the s - fold , and in the @xmath46 and @xmath91 cases we confirmed that the spectra are the same as those of @xmath1 @xmath6 and @xmath7 gauge theories by using another perturbative brane realization of each theory .",
    "this agreement seems highly non - trivial , and gives a strong support to the realization of @xmath1 supersymmetry .",
    "there are many unsolved problems .",
    "what is the most desired would be a direct determination of the non - perturbative central charges @xmath3 . due to",
    "the lack of the information of @xmath3 we could not directly determine the masses of bps states .",
    "when we established the correspondence of the spectrum of junctions and @xmath1 dyonic particles , we use the information of one of the central charge @xmath2 , which can be seen perturbatively in the s - fold .",
    "however , to determine bps saturating masses , we also need the other central charge @xmath3 .",
    "because this central charge is generated non - perturbatively together with the fourth supercharge in the supersymmetry enhancement , we can not determine it by simply drawing the shapes of junctions .",
    "there is another problem related to the marginal deformation . in this paper",
    "we showed that the spectrum of s - fold side gives dyonic spectrum of @xmath1 theory with a particular value of the marginal deformation parameter @xmath15 .",
    "however , if @xmath1 is realized , we should be able to freely change the deformation parameter .",
    "the change of the parameter affects the central charges , and we should have the corresponding parameter on the s - fold side .",
    "the identification of the parameter in the s - fold is very important problem to understand the supersymmetry enhancement .",
    "even if we could obtain the central charges , it would be another problem to determine the bps spectrum .",
    "the existence of bps saturating states is highly non - trivial problem and we need to perform quantum analysis of the junctions to determine it . as far as we know this is open problem even for orientifolds .    in section [ wall.sec ]",
    "we studied wall crossing for simple string configurations .",
    "we determined walls by using another brane realization of the theory which is expected to be equivalent to the s - fold system .",
    "it is still unknown what happens on the s - fold side when the wall is crossed .",
    "we believe any of these questions is important to understand dynamics of @xmath0 theories and s - folds .",
    "we hope to return to these problems in future .",
