    "when dimensionally reduced born - infeld theories are used to describe strings or branes , this same mechanism restricts the energy density of the string / brane to be finite .",

    "we shall have more to say about this later .",
    "we choose the non - compact formulation of qed on the lattice , since this is closest to continuum qed ( in the maxwell case it defines a solvable , free field theory , as in the continuum ) .",
    "this is done by defining the lattice @xmath39 by @xmath40 which is gauge invariant as is the continuum @xmath39 .",
    "this indicates the first subtlety ; @xmath39 is not associated with a single site @xmath41 or link of the original lattice . therefore to preserve the symmetries of the cubic lattice we average our action over the 16 choices of @xmath42 plaquettes associated with a lattice site .",
    "these 16 choices are defined by choosing 1 unit vector in each of the 4 directions emanating from the site , in all possible ways .",
    "the set of plaquettes associated with a given choice of unit vectors is uniquely defined by requiring that 2 edges of each plaquette belong to the chosen set of unit vectors .",
    "simulations are performed using metropolis monte - carlo updates of the gauge fields ( @xmath9 ) on each of the links of the lattice .",
    "we periodically perform subtractions of constant fields from each @xmath9 , since such constant fields have no physics , to prevent the lattice average of @xmath9 becoming too large .",
    "similarly , we periodically gauge - fix these fields to landau gauge , to remove large gauge fluctuations .    to compare with the classical born - infeld results we need to measure the @xmath19 and @xmath18 fields for a point charge .",
    "since we use periodic boundary conditions on the gauge fields , the total charge on the lattice must be zero .",

    "if the magnitude of the point charge is @xmath43 , we distribute a charge @xmath44 uniformly over the lattice .",
    "hence each site has charge @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the spatial volume of the lattice ) , except for that site containing the point charge , whose charge is now reduced to @xmath47 . on the lattice",
    "this charge is introduced by including a wilson line ( polyakov loop ) @xmath48 in the functional integral .",

    "the wilson line for fixed @xmath55 on any given configuration has magnitude one , so @xmath56 while it is expected that @xmath57 this indicates that the phase of @xmath58 causes important cancellations between the wilson lines for different configurations in our ensemble .",
    "hence we have a sign problem .",
    "averaging over the site @xmath55 helps improve our statistics .",
    "even if we measured the wilson line averaged over all sites , every sweep , we will run into trouble if @xmath59 in the most optimistic scenario where the phases of the wilson lines on a given configuration are uncorrelated as are those on consecutive sweeps . for any of our @xmath17 runs",
    ", the number of sweeps is 500,000 and @xmath60 and the right hand side of equation  [ eqn : statistics ] is @xmath61 . as we shall see later , we really need to do better .",
    "lscher and weisz @xcite ( following parisi , petronzio and rapuano @xcite ) have pointed out that one can effectively enhance ones statistics by dividing the lattice into some number ( call it @xmath62 ) of timeslices . notice that , if one fixes the link fields on the boundaries of these timeslices , the monte carlo updates of those fields on the interiors of each slice are independent of the updates of the interiors of all other slices .",
    "thus if one performs @xmath63 updates of the interior of each time - slice , it is equivalent to performing @xmath64 ( restricted ) updates of the lattice . in addition this process can be performed recursively over progressively coarser slicings of the lattice . in practice",
    "we have used thickness @xmath37 and @xmath65 time slices recursively .",
    "let us now examine the limiting cases , first where @xmath66 , and second where @xmath20 . as @xmath66 , the euclidean lagrangian approaches its maxwell ( free field ) form @xmath67 in the limit @xmath20 the euclidean lagrangian approaches the limiting form @xmath68 which describes a 4-dimensional conformal field theory .",
    "[ note that the minkowski lagrangian ( equation  [ eqn : sminkowski ] ) does not exist in this limit .",
    "however , the hamiltonian formulation is valid in this limit , and leads to the hamiltonian @xmath69 which also describes a conformal field theory @xcite . ]",
    "we have simulated lattice born - infeld qed on @xmath16 and @xmath17 lattices . on both @xmath16 and @xmath17 lattices we performed runs of 500,000 10-hit metropolis sweeps of the lattice at each of @xmath70 . on the @xmath16 lattice we ran an additional 100,000 sweeps at each of @xmath71 .",
    "measurements were made every 100 sweeps .",
    "on the @xmath16 lattices the wilson lines and the on - axis fields they produced were measured in the lscher - weisz scheme where we used 10 10-hit metropolis updates of the interiors of each thickness-1 timeslice for each of 10 10-hit metropolis updates of the interiors of each thickness-2 timeslice . for the @xmath17 lattice",
    "we increased the number of updates at each level to 20 .",
    "this means that we effectively used @xmath72 configurations every 100 sweeps for our @xmath16 lattice simulations and @xmath73 configurations every 100 sweeps for our @xmath17 runs , for our measurements of the wilson lines and electric fields .",
    "admittedly these configurations generated in the lscher - weisz scheme are not all independent .    in figure",
    "[ fig : energy ] we present the average action density @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the space - time volume , as a function of @xmath36 for our runs on both @xmath16 and @xmath17 lattices .",
    "we notice that there is good agreement between the 2 lattice sizes , indicating that that the finite volume effects are small . as @xmath76 , where the theory becomes the linear maxwell theory ,",
    "the equipartition theorem predicts that the action density is @xmath77 .",
    "we note that the action density is within a percent of this value by @xmath78 , indicating that for @xmath79 the theory is close to the maxwell theory . in the @xmath80",
    "limit the scaling properties of the action again lead to an action density of @xmath77 .",
    "we see that our @xmath81 action density is very close to this value , while the @xmath82 value is only a little over @xmath83 higher .",
    "this suggests that lattice born - infeld qed is close to the limit described by equation  [ eqn : limit ] for @xmath84 .",

    "the action rises to a maximum of magnitude @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "figure  [ fig : wilson ] shows the wilson lines as functions of electric charge @xmath43 for 16 values of this charge ranging from @xmath88 to @xmath89 and for the 4 beta values @xmath90 . at each @xmath91",
    ", @xmath92 starts from @xmath37 at @xmath93 , and falls faster than exponentially with charge @xmath43 as @xmath43 is increased .",
    "the falloff becomes faster as @xmath91 ( or @xmath11 ) is decreased , and the field theory becomes more non - linear .",
    "we note , however , that the values of the wilson lines for @xmath81 and @xmath82 are almost identical .",
    "this is further evidence that the theory is close to the @xmath94 theory for @xmath84 .",
    "this also gives us the first evidence for differences between the electrostatics of the quantum and classical theories .",
    "classical electrostatics has @xmath24 and @xmath22 identically zero , the contribution of equation  [ eqn : limit ] vanishes and the argument the square root of equation  [ eqn : sminkowski ] reduces to @xmath95 for all @xmath11 . in the quantum theory",
    "it is not even consistent to set @xmath96 , and the result is that the action still reduces to the @xmath11(@xmath91 ) independent form of equation  [ eqn : limit ] as @xmath20 .",
    "we note that the lscher - weisz prescription yields an excellent signal for the wilson line with small error bars over almost 11 orders of magnitude .",
    "we measure the @xmath19 field for on axis separations ( for definiteness consider this to be in the @xmath97 direction ) from the electric charge . here",
    "we need only measure @xmath98 . for this",
    "we need to measure plaquettes in the @xmath99 plane containing the wilson line .",
    "we call the @xmath97 separation of the centre of such a plaquette from the wilson line @xmath100 .",
    "clearly @xmath100 takes the values @xmath101 .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath102 the lattice @xmath103 field is obtained by calculating @xmath104 , where @xmath98 is a @xmath99 plaquette and @xmath105 is the lattice action .",

    "again , the lscher - weisz method yields a good signal . in what follows",
    ", we will drop the subscripts @xmath54 and @xmath97 for convenience .",
    "we will start by considering @xmath18 .",
    "since the equation of motion @xmath108 holds for all @xmath91 , this means that , to the extent that we have rotational invariance , @xmath109 should be independent of @xmath91 , and equal to the classical value . of course",
    ", since we are on the lattice , rotational invariance is at best approximate , and we expect departures from this expectation .",
    "figure  [ fig : d0.0001 ] shows the ratios of the @xmath18 fields produced by a point charge @xmath43 on both @xmath16 and @xmath17 lattices for @xmath81 , where we expect the action to closely approximate the small @xmath91 limit of equation  [ eqn : limit ] , to their free field values . for the minimum separation of source and field",
    "( @xmath110 ) @xmath111 is consistent with its free - field ( maxwell ) value , evaluated on the same - size lattice .",
    "this is because , at this separation , the discrete gauss equation plus cubic symmetry is sufficient to uniquely determine @xmath111 ; in fact @xmath112 . at separation @xmath113 , @xmath111 has fallen to @xmath114@xmath115 of its free - field value .",
    "gauss law and cubic symmetry are no longer sufficient to determine the @xmath111 field uniquely , and we do not have the simple relation @xmath116 and hence @xmath117 of the maxwell theory to help us .",
    "it is thus reassuring that @xmath18 is as close to its free - field value as it is . as the separation increases",
    ", the ratio of @xmath111 to its free - field value appears to be approaching @xmath37 .",
    "this is an indication that rotational symmetry is restored at length scales much larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "the fact that the @xmath18 for this highly non - linear theory appears identical to that of the maxwell theory , apart from lattice artifacts , is non - trivial . for the maxwell theory , @xmath116 , while in the @xmath118 limit @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the familiar sign function .",
    "figure  [ fig : d1.0 ] shows the @xmath43 dependence of @xmath111 , for @xmath121 , for @xmath122 .",
    "this @xmath91 is close to that which maximizes @xmath74 .",
    "thus , for this value of @xmath91 , born - infeld qed should be far from regular ( maxwell ) qed , and also far from the non - linear limit of equation  [ eqn : limit ] .",
    "again we see that at minimum separation , @xmath111 is at its free field value .",
    "the ratio of @xmath111 to its free - field value falls to a minimum for @xmath123 , after which it begins to increase again . for the @xmath16 lattice",
    ", the finite lattice extent tends to suppress this increase while the larger @xmath17 lattice shows a clear increase .",
    "hence we see evidence that rotational symmetry is being restored at large distances , just as for small @xmath91 .",
    "again we believe that the difference between the @xmath122 @xmath18 fields and their free - field counterparts is a lattice artifact .    in figure  [",
    "fig : d100.0 ] we graph the ratios of @xmath111 to its free field value for @xmath124 , where we expect born - infeld qed to closely approximate standard ( maxwell ) qed .",
    "we note again that at minimum separation @xmath111 is consistent with its free field value . at larger separations",
    "there are small but significant departures from the maxwell theory .",
    "however , since these departures are always less than ( and often considerably less than ) one percent , this is further evidence that @xmath124 born - infeld qed is close to standard qed . because these departures comparable in size with our error - bars , it is difficult to make any more quantitative observations , although it does appear that the @xmath16 and @xmath17 values are consistent for the ranges of @xmath100 which they share .",
    "we now turn our attention to the @xmath19 field . here , unlike the case of the @xmath18 field , maxwell s equations are of little help , because the relations of equations  [ eqn : dh ] are highly non - linear .",
    "what we are interested in knowing is how similar these @xmath19 fields are to their classical counterparts and , in particular , whether they show the short - distance screening of classical born - infeld electrodynamics .",
    "we shall use our experience with the @xmath18 fields as a guide to how much the results that we observe are affected by lattice artifacts .",
    "first we look at the case where @xmath81 which we expect to be close to the non - linear limit of equation  [ eqn : limit ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : e0.0001 ] shows the ratios of @xmath125 to its free - field value for this @xmath91 as functions of @xmath43 for all accessible values of @xmath100 .",
    "the similar graph ( not shown ) for @xmath82 is almost identical , which justifies our claim that we are close to the non - linear limit .",
    "we first note that the @xmath16 and @xmath17 graphs are very similar for those @xmath100 values common to each , indicating that we should be able to extract information which is not dominated by finite volume effects from lattices of this size .",
    "secondly we notice that for all accessible @xmath100s and over most of the range of charges considered ( @xmath126 ) , the electric fields are larger than their free field counterparts by a factor of 23 .",
    "this contrasts with the classical case where @xmath127 .",
    "this enhancement of @xmath125 is due to quantum fluctuations which are clearly quite large . at @xmath110 ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath19 is screened , and that this screening increases with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath113 field also shows such screening , but the falloff with increasing @xmath43 is much less pronounced than at @xmath110 , while there is no clear signal for screening for larger @xmath100 .",
    "this behaviour is qualitatively similar to what is observed classically .",
    "however , classically its screening is determined by the ratio @xmath128 ( or @xmath129 ) , whereas in the quantum theory , for small enough @xmath11 ( and hence @xmath91 ) the screening becomes @xmath11 independent . since the limit @xmath80 can be achieved by taking @xmath38 at fixed @xmath11 , rather than @xmath20 , the non - linear limit of equation  [ eqn : limit ] could be expected to describe the continuum limit . the question arises as to whether this limiting field theory is trivial or not .",
    "if it is trivial , the @xmath130 field of a point charge ( a propagator of this field theory ) would be proportional to the free field propagator .",
    "of course , this would only be true of this propagator at finite distances in physical units , which as @xmath38 means large lattice distances .",
    "thus the fact that this ratio on the @xmath17 lattice varies by only of order @xmath131 for @xmath132 , at least for small charges , could be an indication that this limit is trivial .",
    "figure  [ fig : e1.0 ] shows @xmath133 as functions of @xmath43 for all accessible separations @xmath100 , for @xmath122 .",
    "again , we note the similarity between the results from the @xmath16 and @xmath17 lattices up until @xmath100 approaches @xmath134 where the effect of the finite volume becomes apparent , which gives us confidence that the finite volume effects are under control . despite the fact that we are now far from both the small and large @xmath91 limits , these graphs are qualitatively similar to those for @xmath81 , except for the scale on the vertical axis .",
    "the enhancement of this electric field over its maxwell value due to quantum fluctuations is smaller than that for @xmath81 .",
    "the screening which we observe at @xmath110 ( and @xmath113 ) is also less by roughly a factor of 3 over the same range of charges @xmath43 .    in the last of this series of figures showing the @xmath43 and @xmath100 dependence of the ratio of @xmath125 to its free field value , figure  [ fig : e100.0 ]",
    ", we show the results for @xmath78 where we expect born - infeld qed to be close to its maxwell ( standard qed ) limit .",
    "what is clear from these graphs is that , since the @xmath125 never differs from its free field value by more than 2% over the range of @xmath43 considered , born - infeld qed is close to its free - field limit for @xmath78 .",
    "we do , however , observe a small increase in @xmath125 over its free - field value due to quantum fluctuations , and see clear evidence for weak screening for @xmath110 .",
    "this is good evidence that expanding the square root in the action in powers of @xmath135 , and using a perturbative analysis , would be valid in this domain .    in an effort to get a more quantitative understanding of the screening of the @xmath19 field that we have observed , we look again at the screening in classical born - infeld electrodynamics .",
    "here we can expose the screening length ( @xmath129 ) by looking at @xmath136_{e=0 } \\over [ \\bm{e}(\\bm{r})/e ] } \\right\\}^2 = 1 + \\left({r \\over r_0}\\right)^4 = 1 + { 1 \\over 16\\pi^2 b^2 r^4}\\,e^2.\\ ] ] so , for the classical case , plotting the left hand side of this equation for fixed @xmath137 against @xmath138 ( or @xmath139 ) would give a straight line .",
    "figure  [ fig : screening ] shows this quantity from our simulations at @xmath81 . while straight line fits to the @xmath110 and @xmath113 are impossible , the straight lines we have drawn to guide the eye indicate that the @xmath138 dependence is almost linear .",
    "perhaps the observed departures are due to lattice artifacts .",
    "what this behaviour does suggest is that the screening increases without bound as @xmath138 is increased , as is true classically .",
    "= 4.1 in    finally , for completeness , we show the wilson line correlations for each of the 16 charges for @xmath78 and @xmath81 on the @xmath17 lattice in figure  [ fig : wilcor ] .",
    "these correlation functions show the interactions between charge @xmath140 and charge @xmath44 separated by distance @xmath100 .",
    "what these indicate is that the effect of screening on such interactions is to reduce the correlation functions as @xmath91 is decreased ( which as observed above , increases screening ) .",
    "one expects that the wilson line correlation function will behave as @xmath141.\\ ] ] although the electric field shows screening , @xmath125 for @xmath81 exceeds that for the free field and hence that for @xmath124 for the same charge , over the range of charges considered .",
    "hence , the potential energy @xmath142 at @xmath81 exceeds that for @xmath124 .",

    "we performed simulations with @xmath91 values ranging from those large enough to approximate the maxwell ( free - field ) theory to the those where born - infeld qed is well approximated by a @xmath91(@xmath11)-independent conformal field theory with euclidean lagrangian @xmath143 or ( in minkowski space ) by the hamiltonian @xmath144 .",

    "also as in the classical theory , screening is enhanced as @xmath91(@xmath11 ) is increased . however , unlike in the classical case where the screening at fixed @xmath43 increases without limit as @xmath11 is increased , in the quantum theory this screening approaches a limit described by the conformal field theory mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph .",
    "once this limit is achieved , the only way to increase the screening length is to increase @xmath146 .    since our chief reason for studying born - infeld qed is because of its connection to strings and branes , we only need to consider it as an effective field theory with a momentum cutoff , or in our language , a finite lattice spacing . however , it is interesting to consider whether one can remove the momentum cutoff ( take @xmath38 ) in such a way as to define a renormalizable field theory .",
    "if we fix @xmath11 and take @xmath35 to zero , we are taking the @xmath80 limit , where the field theory is described by the euclidean lagrangian @xmath143 .",
    "hence this theory describes the infinite - momentum - cutoff limit of born - infeld qed .",
    "what we do not know , is whether this quantum field theory is non - trivial .",
    "our simulations hint that the propagators of this theory might show free - field scaling . however , the evidence is far from convincing , especially if we consider the possibility that deviations from free - field scaling could well be logarithmic",
    ".    it would be useful to perform simulations of born - infeld qed on larger lattices , possibly restricting these simulations to those using the action based on the lagrangian @xmath143 .",
    "of more interest would be simulations using those actions obtained from higher dimensional born - infeld theories by dimensional reduction , which describe strings or branes with transverse degrees of freedom . in these actions",
    ", the square root contains an additional term @xmath147 , where the scalar fields @xmath148 are the @xmath149 additional components of the @xmath150 field corresponding to the reduced dimensions and are interpreted as the transverse displacements of the @xmath7-brane .",
    "we plan such simulations in the near future .",
    "one of us ( dks ) would like to thank cosmas zachos for several stimulating discussions .",
    "the @xmath17 simulations were performed on the rachel supercomputer at psc under an nrac computing allocation from the nsf .",
    "the @xmath16 simulations were run on a linux pc belonging to the hep division at argonne national laboratory .",
