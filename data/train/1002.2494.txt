    "the progenitor systems and mechanisms responsible for type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) remains unresolved .",
    "the general consensus is that sne  ia stem from c+o white dwarf stars ( wd ) that accrete mass until they exceed the the electron degeneracy pressure limit in their cores , marked by the chandrasekhar mass limit of approximately @xmath7 .",
    "but the details of how the additional mass is accumulated , or specifically what the donor mass source is , remains largely ambiguous .",
    "very broadly , progenitor models are categorized as either involving mass accretion from companion stars ( typically red - giant stars ) in single degenerate ( sd ) scenarios , or pairs of wds that merge through coalescence or collisions in double degenerate ( dd ) scenarios ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the various detailed modeling of these scenarios have thus far provided adequate agreement with the observed spectra and light - curves of sn  ia events , largely due to gross requirement radioactive fe - peak material to power the event ( see @xcite and @xcite for recent examples involving collisional wd mergers ) .",
    "there remains much uncertainty as to which scenarios are actually employed to make sne  ia .",
    "unlike the progenitors of core - collapse supernovae that are now directly found through deep archival imaging at a rate of a few per year , sne  ia are much rarer ( by about a factor of ten in typical low-@xmath6 galaxies ) and their progenitors are much fainter ( by a factor of several million ) , making it extraordinarily unlikely that these progenitors will be similarly resolved in the near future .",
    "nonetheless , meaningful constraints on sn  ia progenitors can be drawn from the resolvable hosts environments of these events .",
    "age limits on the stellar population , the rate of formation of new stars , and the range of chemical enrichment in the environment of the event all provide implied but important constraints on the nature of progenitor systems the types of stars involved , and the physical mechanisms employed to result in these luminous explosions .",
    "it is therefore expected that correlations drawn from these environmental characteristics and characteristics of sne  ia ( e.g. , event luminosity , or event production ) will eventually illuminate how sne  ia are formed .    however presently , the analysis of sn  ia rates in high and low redshift galaxies show inconsistent results on the implied progenitor mechanisms responsible for producing these important cosmological tools . at its heart ,",
    "the discrepancy hinges on two important factors : ( 1 ) the incubation time of sne  ia ( commonly called the `` delay time '' ) , or the time required for a progenitor system to develop into an explosion from a single episode of star - formation ; and ( 2 ) the metallicity of the progenitor at formation , and its impact on either production efficiency or event luminosity . while these are conceptually measurable factors in low - redshift ( @xmath8 ) galaxies , attempts to do so ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) have been muddled by two degenerate effects : ( 1 ) population age , which steadily increases the range of metallicity within a given environment , and ( 2 ) rate of active star formation , which mix - up the time between events and progenitor formation .",
    "it is expected that at high redshifts ( @xmath9 ) these confusion effects should become less severe as the age of the parent population is limited by the age of the universe at @xmath10 to be less than 6 gyr old . moreover",
    ", any substantial bulk delay - time would limit the sn  ia rate in the highest redshift regimes as the universe would not be old enough to produce them .",
    "thus observations in the highest redshifts could provide the best leverage in discerning the ages of sn  ia progenitors .",
    "however the implied delay - time distribution from an investigation of the first year ( cycle 11 ) imaging of the goods north and south fields with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and acs  @xcite were on average very long ( 3 to 4 gyr ) , and inconsistent with the relatively short times predicted from binary star evolutionary models ( cf .",
    "they were also difficult to reconcile with several observations of sne  ia in low-@xmath6 galaxies ( cf .  )",
    "that suggest there are at least two mechanisms for sn  ia production , one which could require a few gyr incubation , and a second which is much prompter , requiring only a few 100 myr of incubation .",
    "additionally there was seemingly little support for the implied trend of an increasingly prompt - dominated mechanism as observations are pushed to higher redshifts from the ground  @xcite .    with just 25 events from the cycle 11 data , and few events at @xmath4 ,",
    "it is possible the sample provided too little statistical certainty to ascertain the inherent delay time distribution function .",
    "in addition , the tested models were simplistic and did little to address more than the average incubation times for sn  ia progenitors .",
    "more flexible functionality to the model tests would do better to assess the delay time distribution .",
    "the addition of the cycle 12 & 13 hst - sn data provides an opportunity to revisit the best delay - time model analysis on a larger statistical sample with a more complete analysis .",
    "here we present the extension of the investigation of  @xcite , applied to the complete three - year ( cycles 11 , 12 , and 13 ) sample of 56 sne  ia .",
    "we compare the observed redshifts of the sne  ia ( in the range @xmath11 ) to event redshift distributions forecasted from model delay - time distribution functions , assuming the star formation rate density model used in  @xcite . through a markov chain monte carlo test , we determine the most likely model delay - time function , empirically implying the bulk distribution of incubation times of sne  ia . in ",
    "[ hzrates ] we discuss measurements of the sn  ia rate history , and its relation to the rate of star formation and the delay times of sne  ia . in  [ model ]",
    "we describe the model delay - time tests . in  [ results ] we show the highest likelihood delay - time distribution model from the hst - sn data . and in  [ discussion ] we discuss the results in comparison to other determinations of the ages of sn  ia progenitor systems .",
    "the various sd and dd scenarios are expected to involve very different characteristic development times and distributions ( ) .",
    "the rate of sne  ia at any given epoch should therefore mimic the stellar birthrate at earlier cosmic epochs , shifted and convolved with the delay - time distribution function , @xmath12 , that is set by the progenitor mechanism scenario . here",
    "@xmath13 is the elapsed time between the progenitor system formation and explosion as a sn ia event",
    ". the volumetric sn  ia rate ( r@xmath14 , in units of events yr@xmath15 mpc@xmath16 @xmath17 ) at any specific cosmic age can therefore be described by , @xmath18\\,dt ' ,   \\label{eqn : snriadef}\\ ] ] where the stellar birth rate is the combination of the star formation rate density [ hereafter @xmath19 , in m@xmath20 yr@xmath15 mpc@xmath16 @xmath21 , and the initial mass function [ hereafter @xmath22 , in m@xmath23 .",
    "this equation is easily translated to redshift space by defining @xmath24 as the age of the universe at redshift @xmath6 , and setting @xmath25 as the age of the universe when the first stars were born , corresponding to @xmath26 .",
    "it follows that @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath12 distribution function is normalized so that the integral sum of the function over all incubation times is unity .",
    "although there is evidence that suggests @xmath22 may vary with cosmic time  @xcite , these variations are notably small ( with small changes in power - law slope ) in the @xmath28 mass range for sn  ia progenitor system stars . for the purposes of this investigation , @xmath22 is assumed to be more or less invariant with cosmic time .",
    "it is also assumed that the sn  ia mechanism , although not ubiquitously affecting all stars in the progenitor mass range , affects essentially the same fraction of stars in @xmath22 in all cosmic epochs , thus allowing a@xmath29 constant . with these preliminary assumptions ,",
    "we define : @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a constant that describes the number of sne  ia produced per m@xmath20 formed , or an efficiency for the stellar progenitor population in actually producing sn  ia events , as presumably not all wds become sne  ia .",
    "the rate of sne  ia can therefore be simplified as : @xmath32 where the shape of the rate distribution with time is only dependent on star formation rate density history and the distribution of delay times .        with the advancing knowledge of @xmath33 and r@xmath34 ,",
    "it is plausible to attempt to `` deconvolve '' equation  [ ria ] to learn about @xmath12 , and thus constrain the nature of sn  ia progenitor systems , which is the goal of this investigation . to this end",
    ", we are fortunate that the star formation rate density history has been mostly resolved to at least @xmath35 , with the compilation data presented in @xcite and @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : sfr ] of this paper ) .",
    "although unfortunately , the volumetric sn  ia rate history is much farther from consensus .",
    "while it is expected that the sn  ia rate should demonstrate some increase with lookback time ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the scattered and often disagreeing rate measurements to date ( most shown in figure  [ d08 ] ) has made this evolution difficult to resolve .",
    "figure  [ d08 ] shows rate measurements from various authors in several redshift regimes  .",
    "it is presently unclear where the point - to - point variation in the rate measures stem from , although the most likely culprits are survey completenesses ( i.e. , _ were all discoverable sne  ia identified ?",
    "_ ) , and differences in applied corrections for undiscovered events , typically referred to as control - time corrections .",
    "these discrepancies in sn  ia rate measures pose the greatest limitation in determining @xmath12 empirically .",
    "the hst - sn survey rates  @xcite have at least given a self - consistent measure of the sn  ia rates over a wide redshift range of @xmath0 ( see figure  [ d08 ] ) , making a determination for @xmath12 from these rate measures alone reasonable .",
    "additionally , the star formation rate density compilation data in the @xmath36 range is largely from the same goods / udf fields  @xcite , making the goods / hst - sn dataset most ideal for empirically probing the intrinsic @xmath12 function of sne  ia , relatively free of the point - to - point r@xmath34 biases , and biases due to cosmic variance .",
    "[ results ] while the goal of this investigation is to determine the @xmath12 function from the  @xcite data , a direct comparison to just the binned rate measurements is unsuitable as it provides only one or two datapoints to assess the production of sne  ia at @xmath4 .",
    "a more robust comparison can be made to the individual sn  ia events that went in to the volumetric rate calculations . in general ,",
    "the volumetric sn  ia rate is determined by comparing the survey sn  ia yield to the product of volume and the effective period ( or control time ) of the survey . in a redshift range ( @xmath37 ) centered at a given redshift ( @xmath6 ) , the rate is generally expressed by : @xmath38\\,\\delta v(z ) } ,      \\label{ria2}\\ ] ] where the n@xmath34 is the yield in the @xmath39bin , @xmath40 is the control time , corrected for time dilation , and @xmath41 is the conically sliced volume from @xmath42 to @xmath43 ( the bin size ) .",
    "a complete description of these parameters and how they are determined for the hst - sn survey , including @xmath40 , is presented in  @xcite .",
    "we probe for an empirical @xmath12 function in a method also described more completely in  @xcite . to summarize , with assumed @xmath33 and @xmath12 models , we use equations  [ ria ] and  [ ria2 ] to predict the expected redshift distribution of sne  ia for the survey .",
    "this result is compared to the observed redshifts of each sn  ia to produce a conditional probability test in an application of bayes method , where : @xmath44&\\approx&\\rm{p}[\\rm{data}\\vert \\dot{\\rho}_{\\star}(z),\\phi(\\tau)],\\nonumber\\\\      & = & \\prod_{i=1}^{56}{\\rm n}_{\\rm ia}(z_{i}),\\nonumber\\\\      & = & \\prod_{i=1}^{56}{\\rm r}_{\\rm ia}(z_{i})\\,t'_{c}(z_{i})\\,\\delta v(z_i).\\label{eqn : probability}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the predicted number distribution , given the assumptions on the models , then serves as a probability function for finding sne  ia at the specific redshifts in which we have found them . by this method",
    ", we maximize our leverage on the best @xmath12 model by using all 56 sne  ia , rather than just the four binned rate measurements .",
    "we normalize the probability distributions to serve as a relative likelihood statistic .",
    "changes in the input model parameters will allow changes in the likelihood with redshift .",
    "for this investigation , we use the extinction - corrected @xmath33 determined from a semi - analytical fit to various measures ( functional form shown in  @xcite ) . the correction to extinction internal to each galaxy is consistently applied to both the published star formation rate densities and to the control times for the sn  ia rate calculations , both in @xcite and in this analysis .",
    "it is assumed that the @xmath33 model and all other dependencies ( e.g. , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and survey parameters ) are sufficiently well determined that their uncertainties do not significantly contribute to the overall probability .",
    "the test method is to select a model @xmath12 , calculate the n@xmath34 , and determine a relative bayesian likelihood of the chosen model from a comparison to the observed redshifts of our discovered sne  ia .",
    "the likelihood values maximize when the predicted redshift distribution matches the observed redshifts , and minimize ( or become zero ) if for example a discovered sn  ia s redshift falls outside the predicted distribution .",
    "this high - risk test gives significant leverage in selecting the most likely @xmath12 when dealing with a statistically limited sample , free from biases associated with binning data for @xmath48 or k - s tests on observed redshift distributions or rate measurements .",
    "unfortunately , it also has a limited ability to address which @xmath12 models are implausible given the data , and therefore such interpretations should be made cautiously .    in  @xcite we examined a few simple single - parameter models ( gaussian models with variance tied to the mean , and exponential models ) , linearly iterating through the characteristic delay time , @xmath49 ( describing the gaussian mean time or the e - fold time ) , for a maximum likelihood . in that preliminary bayesian test",

    "to illustrate the mcmc test a three - dimensional array was constructed for all @xmath54 ( in range @xmath62 ) , @xmath61 ( range @xmath63 ) , and @xmath56 ( @xmath62 ) , in intervals of @xmath64 .",
    "the mcmc values in this array were all initially set to zero .",

    "after a `` burn in '' of 125 iterations ( which were discarded ) , over 1000 test iterations were made where equation  [ eqn : probability ] served as the conditional likelihood between each step in the process .",
    "the mcmc array values thus built up at points in the grid with highest likelihood .",
    "figure  [ contour1 ] shows the most likely region of the mcmc test , in which @xmath2 of mcmc values lie .",
    "the peak of the confidence region is located at @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 where the uncertainties are an approximation of the 95% confidence region .",
    "these model parameters represent a @xmath12 with mode @xmath73 gyr and @xmath74 , shown in the upper right of figure  [ contour1 ] .",
    "the skew ( @xmath75 ) , and kurtosis ( @xmath76 ) , are nearly irrelevant for such a narrow distribution .",
    "the test indicates a @xmath12 that is surprisingly consistent with the best - fit narrow - gaussian model of @xcite in that the mean incubation time is approximately 3.5 gyr , and the entire distribution in contained within a 3 to 4 gyr span .",
    "the implication is , once again , that there is only a single mechanism for sn  ia production that requires _ almost exactly _ 3.5 gyr to develop wd progenitors into sne  ia .",
    "the lack of width in the @xmath12 or a strong asymmetry is incorroborative of multiple components in this high redshift data .",
    "the sn  ia rate history , calculated from the mcmc best - fit delay - time distribution , is shown in figure  [ d08a ] .",
    "the comparison rate models shown in the figure are scaled to match the observed sn ia rates at @xmath77 .",
    "[ discussion ] the strong preference for a very specific delay time ( with little variation ) is uncanny , given the wide freedom of the tested delay - time distribution model .",
    "if @xmath12 were intrinsically bimodal ( as in @xcite or  @xcite , for example ) , the test should have preferred a substantially wider and greatly skewed @xmath78 model , similar to what is shown in figure  [ dtdex ] .",
    "a similarly exponential @xmath12 would have been expected if the sn  ia rate were directly tied to just the availability of wd at any given epoch , as is suggested by the @xmath79\\approx-0.5\\,\\log(\\tau)+{\\rm constant}$ ] model derived from a calculation of wd formation rates , and dominated by the main - sequence lifetimes of their @xmath80 m@xmath20 progenitor stars  @xcite . but",
    "again , the mcmc test here does not find this to be the preferred model .",
    "the implication is that sn  ia are predominately characterized by a single channel ( or mechanism ) for explosion that requires almost exactly the same incubation time from formation to explosion .",
    "this interpretation , however , is difficult to reconcile with various results at lower redshifts .",
    "studies in @xmath8 galaxies have shown strong evidence for sn  ia heterogeneity that extends beyond the luminosity dispersion characterized by the luminosity - lightcurve width relations  @xcite , including low - luminosity sne  ia with strong ti absorption ( e.g. , sn  1991bg , @xcite ) , high - luminosity sne  ia with weak si ii absorption at early times ( e.g. , sn  1991 t , @xcite ) , and several examples of individually peculiar supernovae .",
    "in addition , rate measures in low-@xmath6 galaxies show that late - type galaxies are rather prolific producers of sne  ia , producing an order of magnitude more events than early - type galaxies of the same total stellar mass  .",
    "moreover , trends show that the most luminous sne  ia are largely absent in early - type galaxies , and low - luminosity events are deficient in late - type galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the implication has been that the rate of recent star - formation has a significant impact on the production of sne  ia , and that the overall rate of sne  ia is a sum of prompt and delayed components .",
    "@xcite have argued that a two - component model with a large contribution of prompt sne  ia ( @xmath81 of all sne  ia ) can resolve the inter - cluster fe content and [ o / fe ] abundance in the milky way and remain consistent with the observed low-@xmath6 rates .",
    "moreover , the rate at higher redshifts ( @xmath82 ) from the supernova legacy survey also support the two - component model , but with a prompt component increased in its fraction to as high as @xmath83 by @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a more direct relationship between sn  ia rates and star formation rates ( with little - to - no delay ) appears possible given notable similarity between the @xmath19 function and most r@xmath85 measurements at @xmath5 in figure  [ d08a ] , using a scaling where approximately one sn  ia is produced for every 500 m@xmath20 created with essentially zero delay . to r@xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "] it is , therefore , interesting to address what results when the hst - sn sample is cut to @xmath88 and our mcmc test are re - done .",
    "we performed our mcmc test on a sub - sample of the hst - sn survey sne  ia , selecting only the 32 events with @xmath88 .",
    "the resulting mcmc likelihood contours are shown in figures  [ contour2 ] and  [ contour3 ] .",
    "the results show the highest likelihoods for power - law @xmath12 models which show long tails to large delay times ( peak at @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) .",
    "these models bare some resemblance in shape to several sd and dd models , including  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  , and  @xcite , and the  @xcite wd availability model .",
    "the match is not perfect as literature models are typically steeper , requiring disproportionately more prompt ( @xmath92gyr ) sne  ia than the results of our mcmc test",
    ". the mismatch may be partly due to some rigidity in skew - normal model of our mcmc test , in that the @xmath78 model may not be flexible enough to reproduce broken power - law - like distributions .",
    "however , tests of the flexibility of the model ( exemplified in figure  [ dtdex ] ) suggest this is not the case .",
    "a recent investigation by @xcite comparing the locations of sn  ia with the distribution of light in @xmath93 spiral galaxies ( testing the parent population of stars , as is done in  @xcite and  @xcite for gamma - ray bursts ) offers an alternative explanation .",
    "their results seem to indicate a substantial delay for even the potentially prompt sn ia population of at least 200 - 500 myr .",
    "although this is not as large as the delay from the mcmc results shown in   [ results ] , a scenario in which events delayed by @xmath94 gyr simply do not occur ( essentially cutting all delays below 1 gyr in the upper - right panel of figure  [ contour2 ] ) would improve the agreement of our @xmath5 sample results with many @xmath12 models .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the @xmath88 mcmc results show a second slightly smaller likelihood peak near @xmath95 gyr ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath91 ; see figure  [ contour3 ] ) .",
    "it is tempting to interpret the existence of two likelihood peaks as support for bimodality in the intrinsic delay - time distribution , implying two separate sn ia mechanisms .",
    "however the more cautious interpretation is that this mcmc test is not designed to find bimodal @xmath12 models .",
    "its design is to find the peak and distribution for a model that has a single mode , assuming the intrinsic @xmath12 can be accurately characterized in this way .",
    "secondly , the result also only materializes when a sub - sample of @xmath5 data is used , and not with the full dataset .",
    "there is currently no reason to suspect that our sne  ia at @xmath5 carry more weight than those at @xmath10 , although the possibility is discussed further in  [ sensitivity ] .",
    "the mcmc result from the full sample should be principally considered .",
    "another intriguing cut on our sample is to see if the redshift distribution is dependent on event luminosity .",
    "the supernova legacy survey noted an interesting trend in which their lowest redshift sample ( @xmath98 ) were dominated by lower luminosity ( narrower lightcurve width ) events , and their highest redshift sample ( @xmath99 ) by more luminous events  @xcite .",
    "if low - luminsoity events have a substantial fraction of sn  1991bg - like events , and these events represent a separate channel for sn  ia production ( perhaps more delayed than for normal sne  ia ) , then this subset could show a different delay - time distribution than the parent population , reflected in the observed distribution of redshifts for these events .",
    "the converse could also be expected for the high - luminosity sample , which should contain a high fraction of sn  1991t - like events that could also represent a separate sn  ia mechanism .",
    "a caveat is that by nature less luminous events will be less numerous in the highest redshift regimes , as magnitude - limited surveys lose sensitivity to them at slightly lower-@xmath6 ( our survey sensitivity is discussed further in  [ sensitivity ] ) .",
    "using fits to the lightcurve widths , determined in the rest - frame of each sn , we separate the sample into high - luminsoity ( with @xmath100 ) and low - luminosity ( @xmath101 ) events . is the mode of sn  ia lightcurve widths  @xcite . ]",
    "it should be noted that with the exception of the 22 events used for the cosmological investigation  @xcite , most of the remaining supernovae have limited lightcurve information , which limits further precise determination of peak luminosity or decline rates .",
    "figure  [ red2 ] shows the redshift distribution for the high and low luminosity samples , compared to the full sample .",
    "as expected , there is a trend similar to  @xcite for the less luminous supernovae to shift to lower redshifts , peaking near @xmath102 rather than @xmath103 , and an opposite trend ( although less pronounced ) in the more luminous sample .",
    "these shifts , however , do not translate to significant changes in the derived delay - time distribution function .",
    "we performed our mcmc test independently on the bright ( @xmath100 ) sample of 26 events , and the faint ( @xmath104 ) sample of 30 events , the results of which are shown in figure  [ redcontour ] . as is shown , the more luminous events do prefer slightly shorter delay times ( with a mode near 3.2 gyr ) than the less luminous sample ( with a mode near 4.2 gyr and a broader distribution ) .",
    "the lack of great change is expected , due to appropriate corrections in the control time calculations which truncate the assumed luminosity function at high or low luminosity .",
    "arguably , most of the rationale for such large delay times comes from the notable dearth of sne  ia @xmath105 from the survey",
    ". there has been some concern on the completeness and sensitivity of the hst - sn survey to events in the highest magnitude ( and redshift ) ranges , but recent attempts find more sne  ia at @xmath105 in _ the same hst - sn data _ via independent detection criteria  @xcite , novel pixel - by - pixel @xmath106 comparisons  @xcite , and a thorough review of the deepest region of the goods south ( the udf ; @xcite ) have failed to produce convincing additional candidates .",
    "additionally , there is further evidence for a lack of @xmath105 sne  ia from the subaru deep survey  @xcite .",
    "another critical concern discussed in  @xcite is that high redshift galaxies are likely to have more internal extinction than their low-@xmath6 counterparts due to the very enhanced dust production associated with the high rate of star formation . at these redshifts ,",
    "we probe the rest - frame uv region of the sn  ia spectrum , a region which is inherently photon - deficient , and extremely sensitive to host extinction .",
    "naturally , attempts are made to correct for the portion of sne  ia lost to internal extinction through the control times ( essentially `` efficiency corrections '' ) , by using modeled and observed radial distributions of sne  ia in low-@xmath6 galaxies and extinction distributions within them  @xcite .",
    "however this concern is for an additional extinction over that which is traditionally accounted for . to date , neither the hst - sn cosmology data  @xcite nor programs which span intermediate redshift ranges ( e.g. , snls and essence ) and bridge the gap from low-@xmath6 to high-@xmath6 , show any evidence for an `` extinction excess '' trend with redshift .",
    "there is , in fact , an opposite tendency for routines such as mlcs2k2 ( which fit @xmath107 as a free parameter in lightcurve fitting ) to prefer `` grayer '' extinction laws for higher redshift sne  ia , with @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "our best - fit @xmath12 model is very different than what may have been expected from a more classical modeling of the sn  ia progenitors , and from recent interpretations of lower-@xmath6 data .",
    "it is difficult to see how both could be correct .",
    "however , there is a way out of this apparent quagmire .",
    "if indeed the standard sd and dd @xmath12 models are correct , then there must be an additional factor which puts additional constraint on the shape of the derived @xmath12 at low @xmath13 in this study .",
    "one very likely possibility is that the shape of the @xmath33 function ( shown in figure  [ fig : sfr ] ) does not flatten beyond @xmath109 , rather declines more sharply .",
    "very recent ( and tentative ) results from the hst+wfc3/ir early release portion of an 192-orbit ultra - deep survey of the hudf ( illingworth , go11563 ) seem to indicate that @xmath33 declines to nearly @xmath110 values near @xmath111  @xcite . based on test done in  @xcite on alternative models for the @xmath33 function ( including a model with a sharper decline )",
    ", we predict that similar mcmc test will show greater likelihood values in smaller @xmath13 regions , but the best - fit overall will remain high .",
    "another potential culprit could be an innate metallicity effect , which suppresses the prompt component of the natural @xmath12 through some requirement of a `` minimum metallically '' for the sn  ia mechanism .",
    "a physical rationale for a minimum metallicity effect in sd scenarios could be that potential wds progenitors must develop a sufficient counter - wind to allow for steady mass accretion , to bulk up the core of the wd without triggering surface h & he flashes ( novae ) and substantial mass losses , or accretion induced core - collapse supernovae , or other scenarios which ultimately fail to produce a sn  ia  @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat supportive of the resent observational results of  @xcite on the large - scale environmental impacts on sn  ia production , but acts in the opposite way than what would be expected from their results .",
    "if metallicity is a critical missing factor , a new parameterization of the sn  ia rate with redshift could then be : @xmath112}(t - t')\\}\\,dt',\\ ] ]    where @xmath113}(\\tau)\\}$ ] describes the efficiency in successfully making sne based on the [ o / h ] in the system at the time of formation .",
    "the [ o / h ] ratio is chosen as it is suspected that products of the cno - cycle , specifically @xmath114ne which is traced by @xmath115o abundances in the interstellar medium , have a larger impact on the sn  ia outcome than fe - peak elements in the ism  @xcite , although it is not at all clear how ism metallicity impacts sn  ia luminosity or production .",
    "the global metallicity enrichment of the universe should be a slowly decreasing function with lookback time  @xcite , but due to its convolution with the intrinsic delay - time function of sne  ia , could provide a steep cutoff to the sn  ia production at highest-@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the hst - sn data are most supportive of a single dominant mechanism for the production of sn  ia , which requires between 3 and 4 gyr of incubation from system formation to explosion .",
    "this mechanism is supportive of single degenerate models in which the companion donor stars are low mass ( @xmath116 m@xmath117 ) , based on the main - sequence lifetimes which dominate ( much more so than the accretion times ) the incubation period .",
    "the data are largely inconsistent with progenitor scenarios with short ( @xmath92 gyr ) development times , and are inconsistent global scenarios where prompt mechanisms make up a substantial fraction of all channels employed by sn  ia progenitors .",
    "the preference of our delay time model tests for high @xmath13 are largely motivated by the observed reduction in @xmath10 sne  ia .",
    "further investigations of the sn  ia rate at even higher redshifts , from @xmath118 , should elucidate possible metallicity trends ( or other effects ) from sensitivity issues , and are plausible in large campaigns with _ hst _ with the ir channel of wfc3 .",
    "they will also be easily assessable in future space - based missions such as the _ james webb space telescope_. in the meanwhile , it is also imperative that the sn  ia rate measures in the @xmath119 range reach consensus to make more rigorous global comparisons to the sn  ia rate history , and further refine the empirical delay - time distribution function .",
    "this is within reach with large - scale surveys such as the palomar transient factory and pan - starrs .",
    "ultimate comparisons will be achievable when the large synoptic survey telescope , and the nasa / doe joint dark energy mission / international dark energy cosmology survey are realized .",

    "<S> using the _ hubble space telescope _ acs imaging of the goods north and south fields during cycles 11 , 12 , and 13 , we derive empirical constraints on the delay - time distribution function for type ia supernovae . </S>",

    "<S> the test , which ultimately compares the star formation rate density history to the unbinned volumetric sn  ia rate history from the goods / hst - sn survey , reveals a sn  ia delay - time distribution that is tightly confined to @xmath1 gyrs ( to @xmath2 confidence ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is difficult to resolve with any intrinsic delay - time distribution function ( bimodal or otherwise ) , in which a substantial fraction ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) of events are `` prompt '' , requiring less than approximately 1 gyr to develop from formation to explosion . </S>",
    "<S> the result is , however , strongly motivated by the decline in the number of sne  ia at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> sub - samples of the hst - sn data confined to lower redshifts ( @xmath5 ) show plausible delay - time distributions that are dominated by prompt events , which is more consistent with results from low - redshift supernova samples and supernova host galaxy properties . </S>",
    "<S> scenarios in which a substantial fraction of @xmath4 supernovae are extraordinarily obscured by dust may partly explain the differences in low-@xmath6 and high-@xmath6 results . </S>",
    "<S> other possible resolutions may include environmental dependencies ( such as gas - phase metallicity ) that affect the progenitor mechanism efficiency , especially in the early universe . </S>"
