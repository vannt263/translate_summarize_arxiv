    "experimental options , such as the bbo - lite @xcite , with a limiting sensitivity of 10@xmath142 in @xmath86 , are clearly unfavored as they will only explore an extremely small parameter space . moreover , cmb experiments such as _ planck _ will soon explore the tensor - to - scalar ratio down to a limit of 0.1 , while the next generation cmb polarization mission targets to improve this down to a limit of 0.01 . in terms of the amplitude alone ,",
    "a direct detection experiment must have sensitivity below @xmath143 in @xmath86 to be both useful in terms of model selection and studies related to inflation .",
    "furthermore , even if cmb experiments were to detect a primordial tensor component with a tensor - to - scalar ratio above 0.01 , an experimental option such as the standard - bbo @xcite is not preferred as many of our inflationary models are such that with increasing @xmath3 , @xmath87 ( which is negative ) also increases in magnitude .",
    "this results in a large suppression of power at direct detection frequencies as shown in fig .  5 for @xmath86 versus frequency for curves with @xmath144 .",
    "the preference to select a direct detection experiment with adequate sensitivity down to a cmb tensor - to - scalar ratio of 10@xmath0 is simply a criteria based on slow - roll inflationary models .",
    "it could be that , under non - standard hypotheses , one can generate blue - tilted models for tensor fluctuations such that one generates a large gravitational wave background at frequencies around 0.1 hz .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of such possibilities .",
    "we , however , find less motivation to design a target for a direct detection experiment based on non - standard criteria alone since existing cosmological data rules out most of these cases .",
    "figures  7 and 8 highlight the gravitational wave amplitude , in @xmath86 as a function of the tensor tilt at a frequency of 0.1 hz .",
    "in addition to the monte - carlo models generated from the inflationary flow equations , we also show the model predictions obtained from analytical models .",
    "these calculations reproduce results in ref .",
    "@xcite . figure  8 plots the same information as in figure  7 , except that in this plot we have put the model distribution in the context of observational measurements .",
    "the horizontal lines in figure  8 show the amplitude of the gravitational wave background that lead to a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of one with each of these experiments . in terms of the amplitude , bbo , bbo - grand and ultimate decigo",
    "are expected to detect gravitational wave backgrounds with amplitudes @xmath145 where @xmath146 respectively , consistent with previous discussions regarding these experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition to the amplitude of the gravitational wave background , it is also useful to consider the possibility that these detectors can be used for a reliable measurement of the tensor spectral index .",
    "following the fisher matrix calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite , we determine that for a one - sigma detection of the tensor spectral index in addition to the gravitational wave background amplitude , it is required that one roughly satisfies the relation @xmath147 . as shown by the shaded regions in figure  8 , the requirement that laser interferometers detect both the amplitude of the gravitational wave background and the tensor spectral index leads to a significant reduction in the model parameter space probed by these detectors .",
    "models that have both large @xmath86 and @xmath87 may be studied reliably .",
    "but even experiments such as decigo will not be able to detect values of @xmath148 less than @xmath119 despite their ability to detect the gravitational wave amplitudes for nearly all monte - carlo models .",
    "while the above discussion considered the extent to which the gravitational wave background can be measured with planned interferometers such as bbo and decigo , we now address how cmb information can be put to use in determining the prospects for direct detection measurements .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that ongoing and upcoming cmb polarization measurements will improve the existing constraints from wmap on the cmb tensor - to - scalar ratio and the scalar tilt and running of the scalar tilt . with predictions from cmb data",
    ", one can also optimize the sensitivity requirements for a detection of the gravitational wave background . here , we address the extent to which cmb observations can be extended to study the gravitational wave background at a scale 16 orders of magnitude larger than cmb scale .    as a first approximation , one can make use of a simple power - law extrapolation to establish the expected gravitational wave background at direct detection frequencies @xcite . to test the accuracy of such an extrapolation",
    ", we compare the predictions using exact numerical flow equations with the predictions calculated using a simple power - law extension between cmb and direct detection scales . for this comparison ,",
    "we first write approximate forms for the scalar and tensor power spectra as @xmath149 we can write the gravitational wave background at direct detection frequencies as @xmath150 we assume that the tensor background satisfies the slow - roll consistency relation of @xmath151 and that the tensor power spectrum is not running with @xmath152 .",
    "this allows us to write an approximate equation for the tensor - to - scalar ratio at direct detection scales as @xmath153 using this relation and the approximate scalar power - spectrum with @xmath154 and @xmath155 in equation  ( 28 ) , one can approximate the gravitational wave background amplitude , @xmath156_{\\rm power - law}$ ] at 0.1 hz . in fig .",
    "9 , we show the comparison between @xmath156_{\\rm power - law}$ ] and the exact amplitude of the gravitational wave background , @xmath86 , as calculated through numerical solutions to the flow equations .",
    "relative to the exact @xmath86 values that are generally below 10@xmath142 , @xmath156_{\\rm power - law}$ ] ranges as high as @xmath157 and over - predicts the gravitational wave background at direct detection frequencies .",
    "the differences are mostly significant for models that involve large cmb tensor - to - scalar ratios .",
    "these models have a small , but non - negligible , scale dependence in the tensor tilt .",
    "note that @xmath151 and @xmath152 are simple assumptions that do not hold for general inflationary models , except in the case of power - law inflation @xcite .",
    "these two assumptions also hold well for hybrid models .",
    "they do not hold , however , for chaotic and symmetry - breaking potentials as they often produce significant tensor running ( see figure  12 ) .",
    "the predictions under the monte - carlo slow - roll inflation models depart significantly from analytical models where @xmath88 is mostly zero at direct detection scales .",
    "this departure is also related to the reason why the gravitational wave background amplitude can not be predicted by extrapolating cmb information to a scale roughly 16 orders of magnitude higher as shown in figure  9 . as highlighted in figure  7 , with non - zero @xmath88 , chaotic and symmetry - breaking models come closest in approximating the slow - roll numerical predictions at 0.1 hz , though the agreement is still small .",
    "compared to all these analytical models , numerical models lead to a substantial scale dependence in the tensor tilt .    this disagreement is a concern for a simple comparison between cmb observations and direct detection experiments . at cmb scales ,",
    "the observations are limited to @xmath158 and @xmath155 .",
    "a direct detection experiment will measure @xmath86 and @xmath159 .",
    "this limited information can not establish a unique inflationary potential .",
    "suggestions have been made that the amplitude of tensor components can be used to establish the slope of the inflaton potential @xmath78 between cmb and direct detection scales . while this is , in principle , possible",
    ", the constraints will not be unique unless a particular class of analytical inflationary models is advocated . under the general scenario , where @xmath78 can vary such that the spectral indices are scale dependent",
    ", one can not simply connect cmb scales with direct detection frequencies through a power - law extrapolation .",
    "this complication arises due to the large difference in the two scales .",
    "this difference also complicates simple tests on slow - roll inflation .",
    "as an example , we revisit the proposed test in smith et al .",
    "@xcite on the consistency relation of @xmath160 , where they assumed @xmath161 .",
    "they made this assumption because cmb observations are unlikely to measure the tensor tilt with adequate accuracy due to confusion with lensing b - modes , while direct detection experiments , especially with adequate sensitivity , can make a measurement of @xmath87 . using the assumption that @xmath161 combined with the tensor - to - scalar ratio at cmb scales , smith et al .",
    "advocated a way to test the consistency relation of the form @xmath162 , though resulting constraints for experiments under consideration were not that impressive .",
    "for example , the combination of ultimate - decigo and _ inflation probe _ , at best , would constrain this relation to a level of 20% if the tensor - to - scalar ratio is between 0.01 and 0.1 .",
    "the test of the consistency relation is affected by the fact that , relative to the fractional error on @xmath138 at any wavenumber , one must measure @xmath87 with a fractional error that is 8 times better .    beyond these measurement issues , there are also fundamental problems from the theory side . to study the extent to which the assumption that @xmath161 is accurate , in fig .  10 ( right panel ) , we plot @xmath163 versus @xmath164 .",
    "as shown , there is a large difference between the two tilts such that @xmath165 .",
    "the consistency relation will be violated if one blindly substitutes @xmath161 ( see , figure  11 ) , though as shown in the left - panel of figure  10 , our predictions are accurate to 1% level of the consistency relation at cmb with @xmath3 and @xmath164 .    to show one aspect from which the complications arise , in fig .",
    "12 , we plot the tensor tilt at 0.1 hz as a function of the running of the tensor tilt @xmath88 , again at 0.1 hz . for comparison ,",
    "we also plot model predictions for the running of the tilt through analytical models , where some models , such as the power - law potential , are such that @xmath152 exactly .",
    "this large running is a reflection that the tensor tilt is largely scale dependent . simply using the tilt at one wavenumber for the tilt at another wavenumber will lead to incorrect results .",
    "though the running is small , the replacement of tilt at either cmb or direct detection scales with the value of the other is problematic since the two scales are largely different .",
    "while previous studies hailed the large difference in wavenumber between cmb and direct detection experiments as a `` blessing '' to further study inflation , for arbitrary shaped @xmath78 models that are generated numerically , we find that the situation is too complex for the simple comparison .",
    "the large difference in scale requires a careful understanding of how parameters behave in between the scales , since the potentials are complicated and do not follow a power - law behavior of @xmath14 . and",
    "since observations are limited to two scales , making a potential reconstruction is difficult .",
    "this , however , mostly applies to the case where one is comparing observations to establish information related to an arbitrary @xmath78 . if one assumes a prior shape for @xmath78 , such as through one of the analytical models , then",
    "the behavior can be predicted analytically and the two scales can be matched to the extent that the data allow .    instead of combining cmb and direct detection information to test the slow - roll consistency relation ,",
    "perhaps , it is best to improve the measurement of @xmath164 with cmb polarization data , by improving the sensitivities so that confusing lensing b - modes are separated from primordial b - modes @xcite , and then using cmb data alone to study the consistency relation . on the other hand , with the feasibility of a direct detection , it is also useful to investigate if there is way to use information at direct detection frequencies for a test of inflation .",
    "unfortunately , due to lack of information on the scalar or density perturbations at @xmath166 mpc@xmath6 it is unlikely that information on the tensor power spectrum at direct detection frequencies alone will be useful to establish slow - roll inflation . on the other hand , the complications in connecting observations to an underlying model we have outlined above may start to improve if information on scalar perturbations becomes available at a wavenumber different from that of cmb but between cmb and direct detection scales .",
    "then there would be additional data points to interpolate between the two largely separated scales . in this respect , in an upcoming paper",
    ", we will return to such a study by concentrating on the power - spectrum of 21-cm background at @xmath167 to 100 that provides information on the primordial power spectrum out to @xmath168 a few tens mpc@xmath6 .",
    "in addition to density perturbations , inflationary models of the early universe generally predict a stochastic background of gravitational waves or tensor fluctuations . by making use of the inflationary flow approach for single field models and with predictions normalized to results from cosmic microwave background and large scale structure data , we discuss the expected properties of the gravitational wave background from inflation at scales corresponding to direct detection experiments with laser interferometers in space .",
    "we complement the monte - carlo calculations based on the inflationary flow equations by including predictions expected under several classes of analytical inflationary models , including models involving hybrid inflation .",
    "we find that an improved version of _ big bang observer _",
    "( bbo - grand ) can be used to detect a gravitational wave background corresponding to a tensor - to - scalar ratio above 10@xmath0 at cmb scales , which is two orders of magnitude below the published goal of a tensor - to - scalar ratio of @xmath118 by the planned next generation cmb polarization space mission by nasa ( _ cmbpol _ ) .",
    "a less sensitive version of bbo ( bbo - lite ) with a sensitivity to gravitational waves @xmath86 above @xmath115 is unlikely to be useful given that the predictions suggest backgrounds well below this level when the tensor - to - scalar ratio is below 0.3 .",
    "even if the tensor - to - scalar ratio were to be above 10@xmath1 , we suggest that bbo - grand will be useful to study inflationary models as standard bbo will only allow a marginal detection of the amplitude while leaving the spectral index unconstrained .",
    "the polarized foregrounds , such as dust and synchrotron , are expected to limit cmb studies to a tensor - to - scalar a few times 10@xmath0 , which is well above the ultimate limit of cosmic shear .",
    "unless direct detection experiments are also affected by foreground gravitational wave sources , laser interferometers may allow us to expand the search for gravitational waves down to a tensor - to - scalar ratio of 10@xmath10 .",
    "based on our models , we find that simple power - law approximations are not adequate to extrapolate either information at cmb scales to direct detection experiments or vice - versa .",
    "the differences are largely understood through scale dependence of the tensor tilt produced in the slow - roll inflationary models through flow equations .",
    "we also show that the simple assumption of @xmath169 can not be used to establish inflationary consistency relations by combining measurements at cmb and direct detection scales .",
    "we advocate additional measurements of the primordial scalar power spectrum at large wavenumbers beyond cmb as a way to improve model selection and predictions of inflation .",
