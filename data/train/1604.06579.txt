    "the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe contains rich information on cosmology .",
    "the lss is mainly probed by the spatial distributions of astronomical objects , such as galaxies , clusters of galaxies , or any other tracer that can be observed in the distant universe ( such as the lyman - alpha forest etc . )",
    "the spatial distribution of these objects differs from that of the total mass ( which includes the mysterious dark matter ) , while direct predictions from cosmological theories are made for the mass distributions .",
    "in fact , except for the lensing shear , essentially all observables of the lss are biased tracers of the mass distribution .    although a relation between the spatial distribution of biased tracers and that of the matter is not trivial at small scales owing to the complexity of the physical processes governing star formation etc . , the large - scale clustering of lss tracers is much less complicated as it is `` only '' governed by gravity . on very large scales ,",
    "the biasing is simply given by a linear relation @xcite , and all the complications which arise from the biasing mechanisms are confined to a single variable known as the linear bias factor . in particular , the power spectrum @xmath0 of biased tracers @xmath1 is linearly related to that of the mass @xmath2 through @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the linear bias factor of @xmath1 .",
    "the label @xmath1 represents any kind of biased tracers , i.e. a particular type of galaxies or clusters of galaxies within a certain range of mass for instance .",

    "are measured by their redshifts .",
    "the observed redshifts are contaminated by the peculiar velocities of the lss tracers . as a result , clustering patterns in redshift space are distorted along the lines of sight .",
    "this effect is known as the redshift - space distortions . in the linear regime ,",
    "the redshift - space distortions of the power spectrum are analytically given by kaiser s formula @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the direction cosine between the lines of sight @xmath8 and the wave vector @xmath9 .",
    "the variable @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the linear growth rate , is called the redshift - space distortion parameter . the correlation function in redshift space is given by a fourier transform of the kaiser s formula @xcite .    however , the linear theory with linear bias is valid only in the large - scale limit .",
    "it is severely violated at small scales where nonlinearities induced by gravitational coupling become important , and exact analytical treatments are extremely difficult .",
    "fortunately , there is an intermediate range of scales between the linear and the highly nonlinear regimes where nonlinearities are weak , so that statistical correlators such as the power spectrum and correlation function are amenable to a perturbative treatment ( for a review of perturbation theory in lss , see ref .",

    ", any bias model could be incorporated into the ipt .",
    "the dependence of the polyspectra on the biasing scheme predicted by the theory is encoded in the so - called _ renormalized bias functions_. hereby , the framework of ipt separates the issue of biasing at small scales from the weakly nonlinear dynamics at larger scales .",
    "the ipt is based on the lagrangian perturbation theory @xcite , and the renormalized bias functions are directly calculated from the lagrangian models of bias , in which the bias relations are specified in lagrangian space .",
    "the bias relation is not necessarily a local function of the density in lagrangian space .",
    "in fact , it will involve e.g.  derivatives of the linear density if a peak constraint is present @xcite , as well as the tidal shear if the collapse is not spherical @xcite .",
    "any kind of bias is represented by a `` nonlocal '' bias in lagrangian space , because all the structures in the universe are formed by a deterministic evolution of the initial density field .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the predictions of one - loop ipt for observables such as the power spectrum and correlation function with representative models of lagrangian bias .",
    "the biasing schemes considered in this paper include the halo bias @xcite , peaks model @xcite , and excursion set peaks ( esp ) @xcite .",
    "these lagrangian biasing schemes are physically motivated , and the mass scale is the only parameter left ( once the halo mass function or the collapse barrier is known ) .    the main goal of this paper is to see how differences in the renormalized bias functions predicted by these models are reflected in the weakly nonlinear power spectrum and correlation function .",
    "it is not our purpose in this paper to find an accurate model of bias .",
    "we are rather interested in assessing the extent to which observed quantities are affected by uncertainties in the biasing .",
    "we naively expect that those effects should not be very significant on large scales , because the characteristic formation scales of astrophysical objects are small .",
    "furthermore , the large - scale behavior of the power spectrum and the correlation function is not much affected by small - scale dynamics , except for the scale - independent , linear bias factor . however , scale - dependent corrections predicted , e.g. , by a peak constraint can affect the shape of a feature such as the baryon acoustic oscillation @xcite .",
