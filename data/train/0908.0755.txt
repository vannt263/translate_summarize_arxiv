    "even though their existence are not as well - established as the existence of stellar - mass or supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , it is plausible that intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ; masses @xmath7 ) exist in the centre of stellar clusters ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the coalescence of a binary of two massive black holes in that mass range is a powerful source of gravity waves which will be detectable by space - born observatories such as the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite .",
    "there are two possible ways to theoretically explain the presence of a binary of imbhs in a globular cluster .",
    "( 1 ) the `` single cluster channel '' : @xcite address this possibility in the scenario of a runaway growth of two stars in a young cluster via physical collisions in the innermost part of the stellar system , where the heaviest stars have sunk through mass segregation @xcite . by adding a fraction of primordial binaries to the cluster , @xcite found not one but two independent very massive stars growing in the centre .",
    "eventually , and due to post - newtonian inestabilities , they could collapse and form a massive black hole in the relevant mass range .",
    "@xcite followed the evolution of such a binary with direct - summation @xmath8body simulations and estimated that , in some cases , one can expect a residual eccentricity as high as 0.3 for the binary when it enters the lisa band .",
    "( 2 ) the `` double cluster channel '' : @xcite discussed an alternative way to form binaries of imbhs in stellar clusters .",
    "it has been observed that in star forming regions such as the antenn or stephan s quintet , hundreds of young massive star clusters are clustered into larger complexes of a few 100 pc across @xcite .",
    "these clusters contain typically some @xmath9 stars within a few parsecs and it is most likely that some of them are bound @xcite . also",
    ", most of the clusters in binaries are coeval and younger than 300myr , which means that they merge early .",
    "@xcite followed the evolution of two imbhs initially located at the centre of two such clusters which collide , and studied the orbital decay to the centre .",
    "the evolution of the orbital parameters of the binary of massive bhs is determined by the stellar dynamics and the emission of gws , which is negligible at long distances but becomes more and more dominant as the semi - major axis of the binary shrinks . in order to understand the distribution of parameters we can expect for these systems when they enter the window of detection of lisa",
    ", it is important to analyse the dynamical story of the binary in detail .",
    "the evolution starting at distances at which dynamical friction is important down to the phase of strong emission of gws and their detection and characterisation is a complex and long process which requires different techniques to address it .",
    "one can distinguish roughly three different regimes in the process : ( i ) at the beginning , the massive bhs are at distances in which gws , though always present , are totally negligible and the evolution is dominated purely by the dynamics . at this stage , dynamical friction will sink the two massive bhs down to the centre .",
    "the perturbers , the single massive bhs in our case , are moving through a sea of small stars ( as compared to their masses ) .",
    "the velocity vector of the stars are rotated after deflecting with the imbhs .",
    "the projected component in the direction of the deflection is shorter .",
    "hence , the massive object , the imbh , is cumulating just after it a high - density stellar region .",
    "the perturber will feel a drag from that region from the conservation of @xmath10 in the direction of its velocity vector .",
    "the direction does not change to first - order , but the amplitude decreases a drag force starts to act on to the perturber , so that it slows downs as it sinks down to the centre of the stellar system .",
    "this force happens to be proportional the square of the mass of the perturber so , the bigger the mass of the perturber , the bigger the dynamical effects , in spite of the bigger inertia .",
    "( ii ) as they approach closer and closer , the two massive bhs form a bound state , a binary system . at this stage ,",
    "the binary interacts strongly with stars coming from the surrounding stellar system .",
    "since the stars have a much smaller mass , the outcome of the interaction is that a star is slingshot into the stellar system with a higher kinetic energy , gained from the removal of energy and angular momentum of the binary ; therefore , the semi - major axis of the binary , @xmath11 , shrinks a bit more .",
    "these interactions mostly tend to increase the eccentricity of the binary ( iii ) the process is repeated again and again , provided the reservoir of stars is not empty  in which case the loss - cone would be depleted  , until the separation between the members of the binary is small enough that the emission of gws is strong enough as to take over the dynamics as the main factor of evolution of the orbital parameters .",
    "the binary is practically isolated from the stellar system .",
    "thereafter , the binary begins to circularise .",
    "obviously , the transition between these phases in the evolution is not well - separated and the whole evolution requires numerical tools to investigate it .",
    "@xcite addressed some of these questions in the context of globular clusters and imbhs .",
    "they proved , with @xmath8body models , that slingshot ejections of stars increase the eccentricity of the imbh binary to @xmath12 and beyond and that later the emission of gws then circularises the orbit to rather low , yet detectable values of eccentricity .",
    "but nature is more complex than that . a key effect that will determine the global evolution of both the cluster and of the massive binary of imbhs is the rotation of the stellar system .",
    "rotation has been identified in clusters for a long time .",
    "deviations from spherical symmetry were discovered in some globular clusters @xcite as early as the beginning of the last century . this flattening is a fingerprint for rotation and the measurements of ellipticity",
    "were later extended to galactic and extragalactic globular clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one can also detect rotation by measuring radial velocities of individual stars in the globular clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite first addressed this problem focusing on the detection of gws in the context of a binary of imbh formed as the result of a collision of two clusters ; @xcite looked at the same problem from the perspective of a born - in binary , extended the study to multi - mass clusters and non - equal mass binaries and described the global dynamical evolution with the implication of the larger eccentricities they found in a general context of detection .",
    "the role of the eccentricity of the binary is decisive in the study .",
    "direct summation @xmath13-body models , including post - newtonian corrections , show that the stellar dynamical history before the relativistic regime can significantly affect the final evolution and leads to different merger times @xcite .",
    "in particular , it turns out that massive binaries may enter the relativistic phase with high eccentricities , and signatures of the eccentricities are kept in the harmonics of the gravitational waveforms until the moment of coalescence @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the eccentricity has been previously discussed in a number of articles @xcite .",
    "as derived by @xcite , the orbit - averaged timescale of coalescence due to the emission of gravitational radiation is given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 , @xmath16 denote the black hole masses , @xmath17 the characteristic separation for gravitational wave emission , @xmath18 the gravitational constant , @xmath19 the speed of light and    @xmath20    is a function with dependence on the eccentricity @xmath21 .",
    "thus the coalescence time can shrink by several orders of magnitude if the eccentricity is high enough , resulting in a stronger burst of gravitational radiation and different characteristic waveforms .",
    "furthermore , the behavior of the the inclination of the orbital plane is potentially interesting in predicting processes related to angular momentum exchange between imbhs and field stars .",
    "a natural continuation of the analysis carried out until now is to add another physical factor to the problem , the rotation of the system , since it can have a very important impact in the global dynamics of the cluster .",
    "it can also particularly effect the evolution of the eccentricity of the binary and , thus , the detection and characterisation of the gw observation .    from a standpoint of the data analysis of such gws for lisa , because of their low mass as compared to smbh binaries , imbh binaries should be visible at moderate to high frequencies in the lisa detector .",
    "as most of these binaries coalesce outside the lisa band , they will be observable in the detector throughout the lifetime of the mission .",
    "this should allow us to confidently detect and estimate the parameters for such systems .",
    "if such sources exist in the lisa data stream , it will also allow us , assuming a strong enough signal , to provide accurate distance measurements in the local universe .",
    "the stucture of this paper is as follows : we start by giving a description of the numerical method used for the simulations in section([sec.method ] ) ; later , in section([sec.initial ] ) we give a short overview of the initial conditions we use for the numerical study ; in section([sec.dynamics1 ] ) we provide a detailed analysis of the dynamics of the system , i.e. evolution of the binding energy , eccentricity and inclination of the imbh binary ; in section([sec.dynamics2 ] ) we study some cases in which the binary is initially set up on a counter - rotating orbit in relation to the stellar system in which it is embedded and study the associated brownian motion ; in section([sec.gw ] ) we dicuss about the implications for lower - frequency astrophysics and the detectability of such systems . in the last section([sec.conclusions ] ) we summarise the results and give the conclusions of the study .",
    "the simulations in this work have been performed using nbody6++ , a parallelised version of aarseth s",
    "nbody6 @xcite .",
    "the code includes a hermite integration scheme , ks - regularisation @xcite and the ahmad - cohen neighbour scheme @xcite .",
    "no softening has been introduced ; this circumstance allows an accurate treatment of the effects due to super - elastic scattering events , which play a crucial part in black hole binary evolution and require a precise calculation of the trajectories throughout the interaction .",
    "additionally , in order to improve the exactness of computation of the motion of particles in the environment of the black holes , a modification in the determination of the neighbour radius in the ahmad - cohen scheme was implemented . in principle",
    ", the ahmad - cohen scheme divides the force on a particle into a regular and an irregular component , assigning both forces different time steps ; the irregular component is computed over the nearest particles populating an area called the neighbour sphere .",
    "normally , the neighbour sphere , which is in its extension defined by the neighbour radius , is characterised as containing a defined number of stars @xmath22 , which is typically set to @xmath23 in simulations dealing with particle numbers of the order presented here",
    ". however , when considering a scenario consisting of two heavy particles of the same mass , embedded in a stellar component of equal - mass particles , the neighbour radius is enlarged by a factor    @xmath24 + 1\\ ] ]    if during the declaration of the neighbour particles of a particle @xmath25 and the neighbour candidates @xmath26 a mass difference @xmath27 occurs @xcite .",
    "the enlargement factor @xmath28 is symmetric in the masses @xmath29 and @xmath30 . as a result ,",
    "massive particles ( black holes ) receive a larger neighbour radius , and a massive particle is also more likely declared as neighbour of a stellar particle .",
    "this method accommodates the influence of a black hole on its surroundings and lessens the underestimation on that stellar component which possessed a black hole nearby , but outside the neighbour sphere in the scheme without the enlargement factor .",
    "the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 have been set @xmath33 and @xmath34 , yielding @xmath35 , consistent with the simulations presented by @xcite .",
    "in all our simulations , the conversion factors are as follows : a unit of length is equivalent to @xmath36 pc , a unit of mass to @xmath37 , a unit of velocity to @xmath38 km / s and a unit of time to @xmath39 myrs .",
    "the set of simulations was carried out for a total particle number @xmath40 , including two massive black holes @xmath41 embedded in a dense stellar system of 63998 equal - mass particles @xmath42 .",
    "the initial stellar distribution satisfies a rotating king model ,    @xmath43    where @xmath44 represents the inverse one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath45 and @xmath46 the energy and the z - component of the angular momentum of a star per unit mass , and @xmath47 the tidal potential of the model .",
    "the king parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 are defined by @xmath50 and @xmath51 with the parameters @xmath52 representing the central potential , @xmath53 a mass density and @xmath54 approximately the angular velocity in the centre @xcite .    .",
    "overview over the initial conditions of all simulations .",
    "all values are expressed in n - body units .",
    "@xmath55 is the king parameter , @xmath49 the rotation parameter , @xmath56 the initial velocity of the imbhs , @xmath57 the core radius , @xmath58 the central velocity and @xmath59 is the ratio of rotational energy and total kinetic energy at time @xmath60 .",
    "we use @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 . in all simulations",
    "@xmath64 , whilst @xmath65 for the cases @xmath66 and 0.01 for the cases @xmath67 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this study we have carried out a dynamical study and a first step analysis of the detection of imbh binary systems in rotating clusters . for the case of a rotating king model without rotation ,",
    "the results of the presented survey verify previous outcomes by @xcite , @xcite for massive black hole binary evolution in plummer models facing the development of the binding energy , the eccentricity and determined hardening constants .",
    "analysing an extensive number of simulations , the main results from our study of the dynamics of these systems can be described : ( 1 ) the final eccentricity is strongly dependent on the initial black hole velocities .",
    "( 2 ) the eccentricity is dependent on the rotation parameter of the model .",
    "( 3 ) determined hardening rates in the same range of previous direct @xmath8body simulations of comparable particle numbers . ( 4 ) only weak changes in the inclination and in the orientation of the angular momentum vector direction have been observed , consistent with simulations by @xcite . ( 5 ) counter rotation simulations yield noticeable different results in eccentricity , in one case actually an extreme large value @xmath68 . ( 6 ) brownian motion of the centre of mass of the binary is influenced by the rotation of the stellar system .",
    "all simulations indicate that the orbital parameters eccentricity and inclination develop to passably constant values in the non- or only weak bound state , determined by initial conditions and the influence of dynamical friction .    in order to understand the impact of these sources in lower - frequency gw astrophysics ,",
    "we have extended the direct @xmath8body simulations with a simplified semi - analytical model . whilst this approach is a `` kludge '' and",
    "can only be envisaged as an approximation , the integration of the system down to lisa s window is out of question because this would require months of cpu calculation and , on the top of that , the numerical error would accumulate , so that the results would not be as robust as what one can expect from direct - summation schemes .",
    "we choose the systems yielding a larger eccentricity in the dynamical simulations because these are the most appealing cases in the sense that their detection will be very challenging .",
    "also , information about the previous dynamical story of the system is encoded in the radiation in the form of a nonnegligible eccentricity .",
    "the results presented above show that lisa should have no problems in identifying the existence of imbh binaries .",
    "such events are important for lisa data analysis as they are a previously unconsidered source in terms of dectability and parameter extraction .",
    "our simulations also suggest that they will spend their lifetime in the detector with a measurable eccentricity . in this work",
    ", we have looked at a particular case study where the masses and the luminosity distance of the sources were fixed , and a monte carlo randomisation carried out over the other response parameters .",
    "we demonstrated that we will be able to accurately measure the masses and sky resolution of such sources .",
    "while the eccentricity is weak when the source becomes observable in the detector , it should still be possible to carry out a precise measurement of the initial eccentricity of the source .    for this we used the lfa response for the lisa detector .",
    "this limited the sources we investigated to a maximum gw frequency of 3 mhz to ensure that the lfa was still valid .",
    "as these are also quite high frequency sources , they have a long generation time , which puts a time constraint of the size of the monte carlo that can be carried out . finally , the waveforms used in this work represent eccentric non - spinning binaries .    as well as detectability ,",
    "the extraction of the system parameters is also of great importance in gw astrophysics . using the fim",
    ", we obtained the error predictions for the important system parameters .",
    "as the error predictions are a function of the position of the source in the sky , plus the orientation of the system with respect to the lisa constellation , the monte carlo simulations produced error distributions with large tails . because of this fact , we have decided to quote the median errors for the relevant parameters . in table",
    "[ tab : merrs ] we present the median errors for the parameters @xmath69 .",
    "we can see that for all models the fractional errors in the estimation of the chirp - mass and reduced mass are of the order of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . while there is not much frequency evolution for these sources ,",
    "the fact that they appear in the detector at frequencies on the order of mhz means that we can obtain errors in the luminosity distance of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "we see a similar order of error in the estimation of @xmath70 which is in general a difficult quantity to measure using electromagnetic information .",
    "it is also quite remarkable to see that angular resolution of the imbh inspirals is very good , with median errors on the order of @xmath5 steradians , corresponding to an error box on the sky of about 3 square degrees .",
    "this level of accuracy would place an inspiralling imbh firmly in the field of view of a future detector such as the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) . finally , we can also see , again from the fact that these sources are emitting gws at frequencies on the order of mhz , the fractional errors in the estimation of initial eccentricity is on the order of @xmath71 .    while we have shown that these imbh binaries are detectable , there are a number of ways in which the analysis can be improved in the future .",
    "firstly , a more representative study would also have randomised the individual masses of the binaries , as well as their luminosity distance .",
    "this would allow us to give a more concrete statement on detection and parameter estimation with the lisa detector .",
    "secondly , we restricted the maximum gw frequency of the binary to 3 mhz to ensure a valid approximation to the lisa response . in the future",
    ", we could investigate higher frequency binaries by either using a rigid adiabatic approximation  @xcite or full response to the lisa detector .",
    "however , we should point out that for the higher frequency binaries , the initial eccentricity drops off rapidly , and these binaries may now be essentially circular .",
    "a more realistic study would also include the use of more realistic waveforms which include spins and higher harmonics .",
    "however , work on such templates has yet to fully start in earnest .",
    "finally , it would also be interesting to carry out a longer monte carlo , and assume different mission lifetimes to see how detectability changes over observation time .",
