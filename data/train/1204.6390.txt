    "<S> in this work , we first propose the isovector @xmath0 molecular state to explain the enhancement structure around 3250 mev ( @xmath1 ) in the @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum newly observed by the babar collaboration . under this molecular state configuration </S>",
    "<S> , both the analysis of the mass spectrum and the study of its dominant decay channel can well depict its resonance parameters measured by babar . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation also shows that the isovector @xmath0 molecular state can decay into @xmath2 , which is consistent with the experimental observation . </S>",

    "<S> it is an intriguing research topic to understand this new enhancement structure observed in the baryonic @xmath7 decay . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a novel approach to explain the babar s observation of @xmath1 , which can be naturally explained as a molecular hadron composed of a charmed meson @xmath8 and a nucleon @xmath9 . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate why the explanation of the @xmath10 molecular hadron is reasonable for the observed @xmath1 in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> a molecular explanation requires that the mass of the observed state should be below and close to the sum of masses of its components . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11 newly observed by babar just meets this necessary condition because the mass is near the threshold of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for the @xmath10 molecular system , </S>",
    "<S> the flavor wave function is written as @xmath12 whose expressions correspond to isotriplet and isosinglet , respectively , where @xmath13 is the flavor wave function of @xmath1 , etc . under the assignment of the @xmath10 molecular state , we further deduce the quantum number of @xmath11 as @xmath14    with the neutral @xmath1 as an example , we first carry out the calculation of the binding energy for the @xmath10 molecular system . according to the mass values of the @xmath15 and neutron @xmath16 listed in particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite , we can obtain the binding energy of @xmath1 as @xmath17 mev , with @xmath18 mev and @xmath19 mev . </S>",
    "<S> then we have @xmath20 . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we will examine whether it is reasonable to explain @xmath1 as the @xmath21 molecular hadron . to deduce the effective potential between @xmath15 and @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt the effective lagrangian of the light mesons interacting with the charmed meson @xmath8 or nucleon , _ </S>",

    "<S> usually , in the one - boson exchange model the general criteria of forming a molecular state is that we can obtain negative binding energy of this system and the corresponding cutoff @xmath43 should be around 1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by our calculation , we can conclude that @xmath8 and nucleon can form a loosely bound state with the small binding energy since the adopted @xmath43 value is close to 1 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> cc    as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mass ] , the potential of the @xmath45 molecular state is mainly from @xmath46 exchange , where the @xmath47 exchange is absent . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the vector meson exchanges provide short - range interaction . </S>",
    "<S> usually , the necessary condition of forming a bound state requires that the mass of the exchanged meson is larger than the widths of the components of this bound state . </S>",

    "<S> we suggest experiment to carry out the search for @xmath1 by its @xmath134 invariant mass spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath1 is a @xmath45 molecular state , its dominant decay mode is @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also listed its other decay modes ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> thus , these decay modes are suppressed compared with its @xmath144 decay . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath144 is its dominant decay mode , the final states of @xmath145 contain neutral neutron , which makes that it is difficult to find its @xmath144 decay mode in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> it is the reason why experimental firstly reported @xmath146 in @xmath147 .    in this work </S>",

    "<S> we find that the obtained @xmath43 value corresponding to its bound state solution is around 3.3 gev , which is larger than 1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> thus , according to the criteria ( @xmath149 gev ) , we can conclude that it is impossible to form @xmath128 molecular state .    </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath150 gev is a little bit larger than 1 gev , it is not far away from 1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can not fully exclude this molecular state . the result shown in table [ tab </S>",
    "<S> : decay width ] indicates that the width of @xmath128 is around 100 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant decays of @xmath128 are @xmath151 and @xmath152 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath128 can also decay into @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 . among these decay channels </S>",

    "<S> being stimulated by the recent observation of an enhancement structure @xmath1 in the @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath3 @xcite , we find that @xmath1 can be well explained as the isovector @xmath0 molecular hadron , which is supported by both the analysis of the mass spectrum and the study of its dominant decay channel . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the observed @xmath163 can be described reasonably under this picture . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also mention several other possible decay modes of @xmath1 , which can be studied in future experiments . </S>",
