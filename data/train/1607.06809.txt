    ", we obtain a proof for the swing slim lemma ( lemma  [ specswinglemma ] ) that is much shorter than the proof above .",
    "in order to describe the essence of our online game , the _ swing lattice game _ , we need only two concepts . first",
    ", in czdli  @xcite , a class @xmath222 of aesthetic slim semimodular lattice diagrams has been introduced . instead of repeating the long definition of @xmath222 here , we only mention that the diagrams in figures  [ figpsa ] , [ figslima ] , and [ figindstep ] and @xmath83 in figure  [ figaddfork ] belong to @xmath222 , but the diagrams in figure  [ figcyclm6 ] and @xmath5 in figure  [ figaddfork ] do not .",
    "second , an sl - sequence @xmath77 from is called an _ slg - sequence _ if , for @xmath223 , @xmath224 .",
    "( the acronym comes from `` swing lemma game '' . ) for the player , who can see the diagram , the exact definition of @xmath222 is not at all important .    in order to avoid the concept of slg - sequences , which may cause difficulty for a non - mathematician player",
    ", the program says simply that a _ monkey _ keeps moving from edge to edge such that the two edges in question have to belong to the same 4-cell .",
    "the monkey can jump or swing or tilt ( these steps are easily described in a plain language ) , but it can not move back to the edge it came from in the very next step .",
    "the purpose of the game is to make sure that a random slg - sequence @xmath77 continues as long as possible in a slightly varying diagram @xmath83 , to be specified later . in the language of the game , which we will use frequently below",
    ", the monkey should live as long as the player s luck and , much more significantly , his skill allows .",
    "the recent position , @xmath28 , of the monkey is always indicated by a red thick edge .    at the beginning of the game ,",
    "the program displays a randomly chosen diagram @xmath225 of a given length .",
    "this @xmath5 is fixed for a while . in order to obtain a bit larger planar semimodular lattice diagram @xmath83 , the player is allowed to add an eye to one of the 4-cells of @xmath5 ( by a mouse click )",
    "whenever he adds a new eye , the old one disappears ; this action is called a _ change of the eye_. in this way , @xmath83 is varying but the equality @xmath226 always holds . besides the edges of @xmath5 , which are called _ original edges _",
    ", @xmath83 has two additional edges , the",
    "_ new edges_. in order to influence the monkey s lifetime , @xmath227 if the player clicks on a 4-cell while the monkey is moving between two old edges or when it has just arrived at an old edge , then the eye is immediately changed .",
    "however , if the monkey is moving from an old edge to a new one or conversely , then the change is delayed till the monkey arrives at an old edge . at the beginning ,",
    "@xmath228 if he is late , then the computer chooses one randomly .",
    "after departing from @xmath30 , the monkey moves at a constant speed at the beginning ; later , in order to increase the difficulty , this speed slowly increases .",
    "if the monkey can make several moves , then the program chooses the actual move randomly . from time to time",
    ", the program turns a 4-cell into a _ bonus cell _",
    ", indicated by grey color ; if the monkey can jump or swing between two edges of the grey cell within ten moves , then it earns an extra life .",
    "similarly , the program also offers _ candidate cells _ in blue color ; @xmath229 the monkey earns two extra lives if it jumps or swings between two edges of the adventure cell within 20 moves but it looses a life otherwise .",
    "also , the monkey looses a life when no move is possible ; this can happen only at a boundary edge of the diagram . if a life is lost but the monkey still has at least one life , then the game continues on a new random diagram . when the monkey has no more lives left , the game terminates .    the player , if quick enough , can always save the monkey at boundary edges by using .",
    "also , using appropriately , the player can increase the probability that the monkey will go in a desired direction . in order to make a good decision how to use , when to use , and when and how to apply , the player should have some experience and insight into the process . hence , the swing lattice game is not only a reflex game .",
    "the diagrams of length @xmath181 in @xmath222 are conveniently given by their jordan - hlder permutations belonging to the symmetric group @xmath230 .",
    "since not every diagram in @xmath222 of a given length is appropriate for the game , the program defines the concept of `` good diagrams '' .",
    "for example , neither a distributive diagram , nor a glued sum decomposable diagram is good .",
    "we have characterized goodness in terms of permutations . whenever a new diagram is needed , the program generates a random good permutation @xmath231 , and the diagram is derived from @xmath232 .",
    "the lattice theoretical background of this algorithm is not quite trivial .",
    "however , instead of going into details in the _ present _ paper , we only mention that several tools given by czdli  @xcite and @xcite and czdli and schmidt  @xcite have extensively been used .",
