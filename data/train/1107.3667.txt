    "the first mathematician who has used intervals was the famous archimedes from syracuse ( 287 - 212 b.c ) .",
    "he has proposed a two - sides bounding of @xmath0 : @xmath1 using polygons and a systematic method to improve it . in the beginning of the twentieth century , the american mathematician and physicist wiener , published two papers @xcite , and used intervals to give an interpretation to the position and the time of a system .",
    "more papers on the subject were written @xcite only after second world war .",
    "nowadays , we consider r.e .",
    "moore @xcite as the first mathematician who has proposed a framework for interval arithmetics and analysis . the interval arithmetic , or interval analysis has been introduced to compute very quickly range bounds ( for example if a data is given up to an incertitude ) .",
    "now interval arithmetic is a computing system which permits to perform error analysis by computing mathematic bounds .",
    "the extensions of the areas of applications are important : non linear problems , pde , inverse problems .",
    "it finds a large place of applications in controllability , automatism , robotics , embedded systems , biomedical , haptic interfaces , form optimization , analysis of architecture plans , ... + interval calculations are used nowadays as a powerful tool for global optimization and set inversion@xcite .",
    "several groups have developped some softwares and libraries to perform those new apparoaches such as _ _",
    "intlab__@xcite , _",
    "intopt90 _ and _ _ globsol__@xcite,__numerica__@xcite .",
    "but our goal for this article , is not to replace the semantic approach of intervals , which has to be adapted to each problem by the engineer or the scientist , but to propose a new arithmetic of intervals , which allows to avoid the wrapping and data dependance effects .",
    "it yields to a better construction of inclusion functions . + we expose in this paper the main results of a phd thesis@xcite defended by one the author and some consecutive numerical applications .",
    "the plan is the following . in a first time",
    "we define a real banach structure on the completion @xmath2 of the semi group of intervals @xmath3 , with a vector space structure .",
    "this permits to define the notion of differential function with values of @xmath2 and to use some important tools and the fixed point theorem .",
    "next we extend the classical product to have a distributivity property . with this approach",
    "we obtain a notion of differential calculus and a natural linear algebra on the set of intervals .",
    "after that , we gives some examples in a _",
    "implementation and we end this article by giving some simple numerical applications : optimization of interval functions , interval matrix diagonalization , and inversion of symmetric matrices .",
    "in this section we present the set of intervals as a normed vector space .",
    "we define also a four - dimensional associative algebra whose product gives the product of intervals in any cases .",
    "an interval is a bounded non empty connected closed subset of @xmath4 let @xmath3 be the set of intervals .",
    "the semantical arithmetic operations on intervals , called minkowski operations , are defined such that the result of the corresponding operation on elements belonging to operand intervals belongs to the resulting interval .",
    "that is , if @xmath5 denotes one of the semantical operations @xmath6 , we have , if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are bounded intervals of @xmath9 , @xmath10    in many problems using interval arithmetic , that is the set @xmath3 with the minkowski operations , there exists an informal transfers principle which permits , to associate with a real function @xmath11 a function define on the set of intervals @xmath3 which coincides with @xmath11 on the interval reduced to a point .",
    "but this transferred function is not unique .",
    "for example , if we consider the real function @xmath12 we associate naturally the functions @xmath13 given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 these two functions do not coincide .",
    "usually this problem is removed considering the most interesting transfers .",

    "we determine a natural extension @xmath2 of @xmath3 provided with a vector space structure .",
    "the vectorial substraction @xmath16 does not correspond to the semantical difference of intervals and the interval @xmath17 has no real interpretation .",

    "there are two possible arithmetic implementations , depending on the choosen semantic@xcite . in the first one ,",
    "called semantic arithmetics , the substraction of two intervals @xmath182 and @xmath391 is done according to @xmath392 , and the addition of those two terms .",
    "for example @xmath393-[0,1]=[2,3]+[-1,0]=[2+(-1),3 + 0]=[1,3]$ ] , and @xmath351-[-1,1]=[-1,1]+[-1,1]=[-2,2]\\neq[0,0]=0 $ ] . as mentionned in the introduction of this paper , `` negative '' intervals do not have a physical meaning and the addition / substraction between two intervals can not be easily transfered to the bounds of the resulting interval .",
    "this yields to the fact that differential calculus in this framework is not relevant and one has to compute the derivatives in the center of the intervals in order to recover a certain meaning .",
    "it is not obvious to transfer natural functions to inclusion ones . in the second framework ,",
    "called true arithmetic , the substractions are done in the algebra @xmath348 with @xmath394 . for the previous example in @xmath348 : @xmath393-[0,1]=(2,1,0,0)-(0,1,0,0)=(2,0,0,0)=[2,2]$ ] and for any interval @xmath182 , @xmath395=0 $ ] . in this arithmetic , it is possible to perform differential calculus and to transfer natural functions to inclusion ones by replacing the terms in the definition by intervals .",
    "one has to note that in both cases , multiplication remains distributive and associative according to addition .",

    "<S> in this paper we propose some very promissing results in interval arithmetics which permit to build well - defined arithmetics including distributivity of multiplication and division according addition and substraction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it allows to build all algebraic operations and functions on intervals . </S>",
    "<S> this will avoid completely the wrapping effects and data dependance . some simple applications for matrix eigenvalues calculations , inversion of symmetric matrices and finally optimization are exhibited in the object - oriented programming language _ python_. </S>"
