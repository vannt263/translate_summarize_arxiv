    "the discussion of the stability of the kerr black hole is still in its early stages .",
    "the first intermediate goal is the proof or disproof of its stability under `` small '' perturbations . in the case of the schwarzschild metric , by using the regge - wheeler - zerilli - moncrief ( rwzm ) decomposition of fields in a schwarzschild background @xcite",
    ", the question of the stability of linearized fields can be completely reduced to the question of the stability of the solutions of the wave equation on schwarzschild space - time . in comparison to schwarzschild space - time , the case of kerr space - time is complicated by a lower dimensional symmetry group and the absence of a killing field that is everywhere time - like outside the horizon .",
    "for instance , the latter is reflected in the fact that energy densities corresponding to the klein - gordon field in a kerr gravitational field have no definite sign .",
    "this absence complicates the application of methods from operator theory , as used in this paper , and also of so called `` energy methods '' that are both employed in estimating the decay of solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations . for kerr space - time , a reduction similar to rwzm for schwarzschild space - time is not known . on the other hand , the finding of a symmetry operator , containing only time derivatives up to first order , for a rescaled wave operator gives hope that such a reduction might exist @xcite . if such reduction exists , there is no guarantee that the relevant equation is the scalar wave equation .",
    "it is quite possible that such equation contains an additional ( even positive ) potential term that , similar to the potential term introduced by a mass of the field , see below , could result in instability of the solutions .",
    "second , an instability of a massive scalar field in a kerr background could indicate instability of the metric against perturbations by matter which generically has mass .",
    "if this were the case , even a proof of the stability of kerr space - time could turn out as a purely mathematical exercise with little relevance for general relativity .",
    "currently , the main focus is the study of the stability of the solutions of the klein - gordon field on a kerr background with the hope that the results lead to insight into the problem of linearized stability . although the results of this paper also apply to the case that @xmath4 , its main focus is the case of klein - gordon fields of mass @xmath5 . quite differently from the case of a schwarzschild background ,",
    "the results for these test cases suggest an asymmetry between the cases @xmath4 and @xmath6 . in the case of the wave equation ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath4 , rigorous mathematical , analytical and numerical results point to the stability of the solutions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath6 , there are a number of analytical and numerical results pointing in the direction of instability of the solutions under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "in particular , unstable modes were found by the numerical investigations by furuhashi and nambu for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , by strafuss and khanna for @xmath7 and @xmath9 and by cardoso and yoshida for @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the analytical study by hod and hod finds unstable modes for @xmath7 with a growth rate which is four orders of magnitude larger than previous estimates . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite proves that the restrictions of the solutions of the separated , in the azimuthal coordinate , klein - gordon field ( rkg ) are stable for @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the ` azimuthal separation parameter ' and @xmath14 the paper @xcite , among others , gives a stronger estimate .",
    "it proves that the solutions of the rkg are stable for @xmath0 satisfying @xmath15 so far , these have been the only mathematically rigorous results on the stability of the solutions of the rkg for @xmath5 .",
    "the first estimate has been confirmed numerically by konoplya and zhidenko @xcite .",
    "the stronger estimate has been confirmed by s. hod @xcite .",
    "these results contradict the result of zouros and eardley , but are consistent with the other results above .",
    "in addition , the numerical result by konoplya and zhidenko _ finds no unstable modes of the rkg for @xmath16 and @xmath7 _ , contradicting above cited analytical and numerical investigations .",
    "the situation for the rkg for the case @xmath5 is quite puzzling .",
    "the rkg originates from the case @xmath4 by the addition of a positive bounded potential term to the equation . without the presence of a first order time derivative in the equation , from this alone ,",
    "by help of methods from operator theory , it would be easy to prove that the stability of the solutions of the wave equation implies the stability of the solutions of the klein - gordon equation for non - vanishing mass . also , the energy estimates in lemma  @xmath17 of @xcite , indicate a stabilizing influence of such a term . on the other hand , so far , there is no result that would allow to draw such conclusion .",
    "the numerical results that indicate instability in the case @xmath6 make quite special assumptions on the values of the rotational parameter of the black hole that could indicate numerical artifacts .",
    "moreover , as mentioned before , the numerical investigation by konoplya et al .",
    "does not find any unstable modes and contradicts all these investigations .",
    "also the analytical results in this area are not accompanied by error estimates and therefore ultimately inconclusive .",
    "the present paper tries to help clearing up this situation .",
    "it derives and analyzes the stability of a simplified model equation from the klein - gordon equation , describing the propagation of a complex scalar field of mass @xmath18 in the gravitational field of a rotating kerr black hole . also , the simplified model equation is in certain sense `` mathematically controllable . ''",
    "the latter term will be given meaning in the next section .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  @xmath19 gives the derivation of the simplified model equation .",
    "section  @xmath20 gives basic properties of operators read off from this approximate equation which provide the basis for the formulation of an initial - value problem along with a stability analysis for that equation given in the same section .",
    "the results of section  @xmath20 are used in section  @xmath21 to show the instability of the solutions of the approximate equation for moderately large rotation parameters @xmath1 .",
    "finally , the paper concludes with a discussion of the results and an appendix containing the proof of a result that is used in the main text .",
    "the goal of this section is the description of the relationship between the klein - gordon equation and the approximate equation . of course , this relationship is crucial for the model character of the latter equation . in particular , there are various ways to arrive at approximate equations suitable for analytical treatment . therefore in the following , we describe the derivation of the approximate equation in more detail .",
    "we mention that it is easily seen that our approach is in many aspects different from that of detweiler in @xcite . to facilitate analytical treatment , the spectral problem , that is associated with the approximate equation ,",
    "is required to lead on a special case of the coulomb wave equation .",
