    "the number of supernova remnants known to be interacting with molecular clouds has increased over the last few years from one single example , ic  443 @xcite , to six : ic  443 , w  51c @xcite , 3c  391 @xcite , w  44 @xcite and w  28 @xcite , hb  21 ( g89.0 + 4.7 ) @xcite .",
    "the strong observational evidence for interactions includes broad co lines , bright far - infrared lines , or oh masers .",
    "other evidence can be infrared cooling lines from h@xmath0 , oh , and co tracing regions that are both hot and dense @xcite .",
    "the growing number of molecular interacting supernova remnants provides critical laboratories to study shock physics and comparison of the strong supernova shocks with other shocks in astrophysical objects such as wind shocks and outflows .",
    "how the shocks develop around clouds and how shocks affect molecular cloud evolution are not well understood .",
    "chevalier ( 1999 ) considered two density regimes ( cloud and intercloud ) for the pre - shock gas .",
    "the observed infrared lines require , in addition to the intercloud medium , shocks into gas with both moderate ( @xmath910@xmath10 @xmath7 ) and high ( @xmath9 10@xmath11 @xmath7 ) pre - shock densities .",
    "the results suggest that an ensemble of different shocks develops on small scales , due to the high contrasts in density .    in the case of ic  443",
    ", studies have shown that there are two types of shocks , but at any given place within the remnant , only a single type of shock is evident @xcite .",
    "2mass _ image of ic  443 shows a striking contrast in near - infrared color between the south ( where the shock is impacting dense molecular gas ) and the northeast ( where the shock is impacting lower - density material ) . the northeast rim is mostly [ ] line emission in the near - infrared , with strong [ ] and other ionic lines in the mid- and far - infrared , consistent with a j - shock with a shock velocity of 100 km s@xmath12 and a pre - shock density of order @xmath5 @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast , the southern ridge is dominated by h@xmath0 line emission exhibiting a clumped and knotty structure .",
    "a surprising result is that no atomic lines were not detected from the southern ridge in recent isocam observations @xcite .",
    "the isocam observations are consistent with a pure c - shock with a low shock velocity of 30 km s@xmath12 and a dense medium ( 10@xmath11 @xmath7 ) .",
    "because ic  443 is a uniquely well - studied molecular - interacting remnant , it is not clear whether the interstellar medium conditions were special around the ic  443 progenitor ( recently located by @xcite ) , or whether the strong variations in pre - shock conditions are characteristic of the environments of type 2 supernovae .    in this paper , we look in some detail at the morphology of molecular and ionic shocks in the supernova remnant 3c  391 ( g31.9 + 0.0 ) . figure  [ finder ]",
    "shows the radio image of 3c  391 .",
    "the remnant has a distinctive ` breakout ' radio morphology , suggesting that it has struck a region of significantly higher density northwest of the explosion site @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission is contained within the radio shell , making 3c  391 one of the new class of ` mixed - morphology ' remnants with bright radio shells surrounding diffuse , central , thermal x - rays @xcite .",
    "millimeter - wave co observations revealed that there is indeed a giant molecular cloud to the northwest of the remnant and at a rotation - curve distance consistent with the estimated distance of the remnant @xcite .",
    "two oh 1720 mhz masers were detected from 3c  391 , suggesting that in at least two places the shock may be interacting with molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the remnant is so bright in the [ ] line that it appears that relatively dense shocks are present both toward the oh masers and the bright radio bar @xcite .",
    "one of the oh masers was found to be included in a region of broad cs and co lines , clearly revealing the shocked gas , but somewhat mysteriously only revealing it from a small region in the southern part of the remnant ; this ` broad molecular line ' region is called 3c  391:bml @xcite .    the nature of 3c  391:bml is unknown because it has not been imaged with sufficient resolution .",
    "based on the millimeter - wave observations ( @xmath13 beam ) , a high cloud pressure was inferred , suggesting gravitational compression is needed to keep the cloud from rapidly dissipating ; the self - gravity also suggests imminent collapse @xcite .",
    "the detection of far - infrared emission from h@xmath0o , co , and oh , in an @xmath14 beam , further suggested the presence of high - density gas . but neither the structure of the cloud ( highly fragmented or monolithic ) nor the chemistry ( diffuse gas with low h@xmath0o abundance , or smaller clumps with the predicted high h@xmath0o post - shock abundance ) could be resolved .",
    "the new observations presented in this paper explore the distribution of shocked molecular and ionized gas , using spatially - resolved spectroscopy and narrow - band imaging , revealing dramatic color differences between the different parts of the remnant , and uncovering a cluster of pre - stellar molecular cores in 3c  391:bml .",
    "the primary observations for this paper are two sets of images , one made with the _ infrared space observatory _ and the other with palomar 200@xmath4 telescope .",
    "figure  [ finder ] illustrates the regions we observed , in the context of the entire supernova remnant , as traced by the radio image @xcite .",
    "there are also two ` geographical ' landmarks in the region covered , to which we will often refer .",

    "observations of 3c  391 were made using the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "@xcite mid - infrared camera isocam @xcite through a variety of filters , in order to determine the morphology and physical origin of infrared emission from 3c  391 .",
    "isocam is a @xmath16 pixel array , and we selected the 6@xmath4 pixel field of view to get a large , un - vignetted field of view .",
    "first , on april 11 , 1997 , an image of the entire remnant was made in the wide lw3 ( 1218 @xmath1 m ) filter .",
    "the mosaic was made with a @xmath17 raster of pointings separated by 80@xmath4 , which is much smaller than the 192@xmath4 instantaneous field of view to provide redundancy . at each pointing , a set of 7 frames of 2.1 sec duration were taken , providing another level of redundancy .",
    "the observation lasted 36 minutes .",
    "cosmic rays were identified ( and masked ) using a temporal high - pass filter , and the pixel - to - pixel gain was determined from the un - registered median of all of the images ; both steps make use of the high level of redundancy in the data .",
    "figure  [ figlw3 ] shows the 1218 @xmath1 m image , which covers the entire remnant and is dominated by remnant emission and about 100 stars .",
    "the _ iras _ data for 3c  391 are hopelessly contaminated by stars , such as the very bright star just outside the radio bar , which swamp the remnant at low angular and spectral resolution .",
    "the isocam image shows that mid - infrared emission from 3c  391 generally follows the radio shell .",
    "the nature of the 1218 @xmath1 m emission from the remnant is discussed below in  5 .",
    "there is an extension of diffuse 1218 @xmath1 m emission , extending southward from the radio bar , toward lower right of figure  [ figlw3 ] .",
    "it is not clear whether this extension is related to the remnant , although it appears , from the 1218 @xmath1 m image alone , to be connected to it .",
    "the extension does not have associated radio emission , so it is well outside what we thought of as the boundary of the remnant . instead",
    ", the extension may be a photodissociation region on the surface of the same molecular cloud with which the remnant is interacting ; in this case the emission would be due to aromatic hydrocarbons and fine structure lines of [ ] and [ ] .",
    "having demonstrated that 3c  391 is a bright mid - infrared source , we returned to 3c  391 on november 3 , 1997 , to obtain a complete set of images with the circular - variable filter ( cvf ) .",
    "the goal was to discern what is the emission mechanism : lines or continuum .",
    "for these cvf observations , only a single field of view ( 192@xmath4 ) was observed , centered on the location of the bright oh maser and wide co lines . the observation proceeded by setting the filter wheel near the highest wavelength of the long - wavelength cvf [ 16.14 @xmath1 m ] , taking 12 frames of 2.1 sec duration , moving down to the next step of the long - wavelength cvf [ 16.05 @xmath1 m ] , etc .",
    ", until near the end of the long - wavelength cvf [ 10.09 @xmath1 m ; 69 steps ] then setting the filter wheel near the highest wavelength of the next cvf [ 9.986 @xmath1 m ] and until near the end of this cvf [ 5.14 @xmath1 m ; 81 steps ] .",
    "the entire cvf observation took 68 minutes to complete .",
    "the data were reduced using the same methods described in another recent paper @xcite .",
    "a correction was applied to remove the transient gain variations , based on the ias method @xcite , which led to typically @xmath18% changes in the surface brightness , with @xmath19% changes at wavelengths where there are sharp changes in the surface brightness . before we applied the transient gain correction",
    ", there were some differences between the spectra taking in the increasing and decreasing wavelength directions , due to subtle differences in the time constants of the detectors ; these remain problematic only around the 6.2 and 11.3 @xmath1 m pah features .",
    "the final reduction yielded a cube of @xmath16 spatial pixels ( with one column dead ) @xmath20 unique wavelengths .",
    "the spectral passband of each cvf step is 0.33 @xmath1 m wide at 16 @xmath1 m , 0.27 @xmath1 m wide at 10 @xmath1 m ; 0.21 @xmath1 m wide at 9 @xmath1 m , and 0.14 @xmath1 m wide at 5.2 @xmath1 m .    .line",
    "brightnesses@xmath21 for 3c  391:bml [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the clumps in our h@xmath0 image are probably are dense cores that have survived the passage of the blast wave .",
    "the clump masses were estimated from the observed brightness of the 2.12 @xmath1 m line using a 10-level model for the h@xmath0 molecule over a range of densities and with kinetic temperature 1300 k ( derived in the next section ) ; the results can be approximated by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the clump angular diameter at the 9 kpc distance assumed for 3c  391 .",
    "the total clump mass can be higher than our calculated mass because the near - infrared line only detects the excited h@xmath0 and not the dense , cold h@xmath0 in the centers of the clumps .",
    "analysis of the excitation of broad - line cs emission implied that the density of the mm - wave emitting region is @xmath24 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a clump with @xmath25 diameter would therefore have a mass of 0.6 @xmath26 , comparable to the properties inferred from the h@xmath0 observations , suggesting that we have resolved the mm - wave emitting regions .",
    "the clumps in table  [ h2clump ] would be gravitationally bound if their internal turbulent motions were less than @xmath27 km  s@xmath12 , which is typical for quiescent gas .",
    "thus the pre - shock clumps were likely self - gravitating .",
    "it appears that the shock front passing through 3c  391:bml has uncovered a set of pre - stellar cores .",
    "we say that the cores are ` pre - stellar ' because , even though they appear centrally condensed in the h@xmath0 image , there are no stars at the core locations : in the 2.19 @xmath1 m continuum image , there are no stars down to k magnitude 15 ( 1 mjy ) . and in the mid - infrared ( 1218 @xmath1 m ) continuum image , there are no stars down to 10 mjy . embedded stars would need very high k - band extinctions but low 1218 @xmath1 m flux .",
    "thus , the cores probably do not harbor young stars .    the fate of these prestellar cores , after having been perturbed by the supernova shock , is worth considering in detail , because many star - forming molecular clouds will suffer internal or surface supernova explosions .",
    "the outer layers of the dense cores will be stripped by the ram pressure of the shock .",
    "balancing the ram - pressure force , @xmath28 , versus the gravitational force binding a thick layer with radius @xmath29 from the center,@xmath30 , we find a stripping radius of @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the supernova energy in units of @xmath33 erg , @xmath34 is radius of the ( assumed adiabatic ) remnant in units of 10 pc , and @xmath35 is the mass of the clump .",
    "the stripped radius is comparable to the observed size of the clumps , which is consistent with the hypothesis that the clumps are gravitationally bound cores stripped of their outer layers .",
    "the stripped radii are smaller than the apparent outer edges of unshocked pre - stellar cores inferred from mid - infrared extinction measurements @xcite .",
    "clumps encountered earlier in the remnant evolution would be even more stripped or completely distorted , to become a shocked filament rather than retaining integrity as a core . for the surviving clumps , with",
    "the outer layers gone , the accretion onto the central core will slow , perhaps stunting the development of the star .",
    "if a core has a radial density profile proportional to @xmath36 , then the observed masses ( @xmath37 ) and radii ( @xmath38 cm ) suggest densities of order @xmath39 @xmath7 .",
    "the lifetime estimates for pre - stellar cores of this density are of order @xmath40 yr @xcite , longer than the remnant age and consistent with the idea that the several observed cores were in an intermediate , pre - stellar phase at the time of the supernova .",
    "if the pre - shock cores were already gravitationally bound , they may have been already collapsing in the center , with the outer parts supported by turbulence and magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field and angular momentum of the outer layers would be swept away , so the pre - stellar core would no longer be as coupled to its surroundings as it would be if it had not been shocked .",
    "the net effect on the star formation potential of the shocked cores could be rather subtle , as a very dense central core may be relatively immune to the effects of a supernova shock .",
    "this topic deserves theoretical treatment , as it concerns the connection between environmental effects and star formation in the not - uncommon situation of molecular cores within 10 pc of a supernova explosion .",
    "one of the h@xmath0 peaks , 3c  391:bmlh2 3 , is precisely at the position of one of the two oh 1720 mhz masers in 3c  391 @xcite .",
    "the astrometry was determined using a set of 12 stars from the 2mass catalog , and we checked for local distortion by precisely measuring the offset from the bright star near the center of 3c  391:bml .",
    "the astrometric accuracy and the radio - infrared offset are both smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "the h@xmath0 peak associated with the oh maser appears to be resolved into a round clump with a fwhm of @xmath42 .",
    "( in the 1% h@xmath0 filter , the clump brightness is equivalent to a magnitude 15.6 star , while in a broad k@xmath43 filter , the clump would be equivalent to magnitude 18.5 . )",
    "this ` maser clump ' accounts for only @xmath44% of the entire h@xmath0 luminosity of 3c  391:bml .",
    "thus , while the oh 1720 mhz masers are ` signposts ' of molecular shock fronts @xcite , the oh masers are not one - to - one tracers of molecular shocks .",
    "not all molecular shocks give rise to oh masers ",
    "other clumps that appear similar to 3c  391:bmlh2 3 ( the ` maser clump ' ) do not have bright , mased oh emission .",
    "our observations may offer some clues to the nature of the oh 1720 mhz masers .",
    "if our interpretation of the h@xmath0 clumps is correct , then the 1720 mhz masers may be features of protostars or pre - stellar cores that were partially uncovered by the shocks .",
    "the precise combination of physical conditions required to make a 1720 mhz oh maser may occur in specific layer ( or region ) in the atmospheres of pre - stellar , shocked cores ; indeed , oh masers are known to be signposts of star formation @xcite .",
    "the 6 lines of h@xmath0 that were detected in the isocam data span a range of upper level energies lying 1682 to 7197 k above ground , so they sample warm , collisionally - excited gas recently heated by shocks .",
    "figure  [ h2exc ] shows the upper - level column densities for each of the observed lines , after correcting for extinction .",
    "the populations of levels 2000 k and higher above the ground state are well approximated by local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) at 1300  k with a warm h@xmath0 column density of @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "some support for our extinction estimate is that the s(3 ) line fits nicely in figure  [ h2exc ] ; this line is at 9.66 @xmath1 m and is extinguished by the silicate feature of the interstellar extinction curve . regarding the ortho - to - para ratio , the isocam spectrum includes 3 transitions of para - h@xmath0 and 3 lines of ortho - h@xmath0 ( asterisks in fig .  [ h2exc ] ) .",
    "both ortho and para transitions fall along the same trend in fig .",
    "[ h2exc ] , so the ortho - to - para ratio is close to 3 .",
    "the excitation of the near - infrared line is somewhat less than predicted by a single - temperature lte model . in lte ,",
    "a model that matches the brightness of the 0 - 0 s(7 ) line would accurately predict the brightness of the 1 - 0 s(1 ) line , because their upper energy levels are very close .",
    "however , the critical density for the upper level of the 1 - 0 s(1 ) line is @xmath47 @xmath7 , an order of magnitude larger than that of the 0 - 0 s(7 ) line , so the 1 - 0 s(1 ) line may be subthermally excited .",
    "we calculated the excitation of the 10 lowest levels of h@xmath0 using the excitation rate coefficients for h@xmath0-h@xmath0 collisions as approximated by @xcite ; the results show that gas with @xmath48 k and @xmath49 @xmath7 could explain the observed excitation of the levels between 2000 and 8000 k above ground , including the levels that produce the near - infrared line .",
    "a single - temperature model can not explain all the observed line brightnesses : the models miss the lowest - energy line by a factor of 2 .",
    "therefore , the single - temperature models under - predict the h@xmath0 column density . for the bright ,",
    "well - observed remnant ic  443 , a two - temperature model could adequately explain the mid - infrared lines @xcite .",
    "figure  [ h2exc ] compares the excitation model derived from near- to mid - infrared observations of ic  443 @xcite and our 3c  391 data .",
    "the ic  443 model did not have to be rescaled for this comparison .",
    "for both shocks , the column density inferred from observations of the near - infrared lines alone is smaller than that inferred from the lower - energy mid - infrared lines .",
    "the actual excitation is non - lte , and it depends both on the volume density of the emitting region and possibly on the time that the gas has cooled @xcite .",
    "we used the two - temperature excitation model to calculate the clump column densities in table  [ h2peaks ] .",
    "the ionic shocks are traced , in our data , by emission from [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] , which follows the shell - like radio emission rather closely .",
    "figure  [ fe_radio ] the palomar [ ] image with the resampled radio image overlaid as contours .",
    "the bright [ ] in the northwest agrees in detail with the size and location of the bright radio bar , and the other features , though fainter , also seem to agree in detail .",
    "the morphology of the [ ne ] emission also seems to follow the radio emission in some detail . from the cvf spectra",
    ", it appears that the 1218 @xmath1 m filter image , after subtracting the reference spectrum , is dominated by the [ ] 12.8 @xmath1 m and [ ] 15.5 @xmath1 m lines .",
    "thus the diffuse emission in figure  [ figlw3 ] is effectively a map of [ ne ] , at least for the part associated with the remnant .",
    "[ figlw3 ] also contains aromatic hydrocarbon emission from unrelated gas , but for the structure related to 3c  391:bml , the spectra in figs .",
    "[ clumpspec ] and  [ ionspec ] show that there is no aromatic hydrocarbon emission or continuum from the remnant . ) from this figure we see that the radio bar is replicated in [ ne ] .",
    "the radio ridge at the easternmost part of the remnant ( @xmath50 ) is also present in the [ ne ] image , but with an apparent shift such that the [ ne ] is partly ` outside ' of the radio shell .",
    "care is needed in interpreting wide - band images such as figure  [ figlw3 ] , because the spectrum can vary significantly from place to place .",
    "the disagreement between the radio and 1218 @xmath1 m image may in this case be due to a contribution from dust grains , as is suggested by comparing to the 10.811.9 @xmath1 m image ( see  6 ) .    the agreements and differences between the [ ne ] , [ fe ] , and radio images are the result of combined effects of excitation , grain destruction , and magnetic field .",
    "in general , the [ ] image appears better - correlated with the radio emission than the [ ne ] image .",
    "the close agreement of [ fe ] and radio emission suggests that the shocks that are most able to accelerate cosmic rays are also the ones capable of destroying dust grains .",
    "the [ ne ] emitting regions may be shocks that are less efficient at grain destruction because of higher pre - shock density , leading to lower shock velocity ; grain destruction is very sensitive to the shock velocity @xcite .",
    "the differences between [ ne ] and [ fe ] could also be due to excitation differences , because the [ ne ] lines we observed are among levels that are closer to the ground state than the levels that produce the near - infrared [ ] line .",
    "the [ ] 1.64 @xmath1 m emission from the radio bar is bright , suggesting a hot postshock region with a significant fraction of grains destroyed .",
    "the [ ] 26 @xmath1 m line was observed toward the northern part of 3c  391 using _",
    "sws , in a @xmath51 aperture @xcite .",
    "the sws pointing was centered on an earlier lws pointing that was part of a strip map crossing the northern edge of the remnant .",
    "it appears that the sws pointing called 3c  391:radio does not sample the brightest part of the radio bar , where our new palomar image reveals a highly concentrated bar of emission .",
    "instead , the sws observation sampled a region of much fainter [ ] emission , @xmath52 . comparing the near - infrared limit to the observed brightness of the 26 @xmath1 m line , using a 13-level excitation model for the fe@xmath53 ion",
    ", we can conclude that the emitting region has a temperature less than 3000 k , which is consistent with the brightness of other lines observed behind the j - shocks into moderately dense gas .",
    "the pre - shock density for the radio bar was likely comparable to that of the molecular cloud . comparing the [ ] brightness to j - shock models ,",
    "a moderate density @xmath54 was inferred @xcite .",
    "the brightness and morphology to the radio bar of 3c  391 is very similar to the northeast rim of ic  443 , which has more complete spectroscopic observations .",
    "the surface brightness and line ratios imply a pre - shock density or order",
    "@xmath55 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "such densities are actually comparable to the average densities of giant molecular clouds such as are traced by rotational co lines at mm - wavelengths .",
    "for example , the rosette molecular cloud @xcite and molecular clouds in the inner galaxy @xcite were found to be composed of co - emitting regions with densities in the range @xmath56 @xmath7 embedded in even lower density gas . thus the ` ionic ' shocks are plausibly shocks into the co - emitting pre - shock regions that traditionally define molecular clouds .",
    "so far , we have discussed only ionic lines from the shocks in the northwestern part of the remnant , arguing that these shocks are completely dissociative .",
    "the excitation of the ionic lines , the shock velocity inferred from the width of the [ ] 63 @xmath1 m line @xcite , and the presence of the molecular cloud surface so nearly tangent to the northwestern radio bar @xcite all show that the pre - shock gas was mostly molecular .",
    "furthermore , there is some weak emission from molecular gas in the northwestern region : the h@xmath0 s(3 ) line was detected using the _ iso _ sws , at a brightness of @xmath57 erg @xmath46 s@xmath12 sr@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this emission is much weaker than that detected toward 3c  391:bml .",
    "the h@xmath0s(9 ) , which arises from a much higher energy level than the s(3 ) line , was not detected from the northwest ; nor is there 10 s(1 ) line emission in the palomar image .",
    "thus , we interpret the weak , low - excitation h@xmath0 emission from the northwestern part of 3c  391 as molecules that have _ reformed _ behind a dissociative shock .",
    "for such a shock , the molecules reform after the gas has recombined and cooled , and the bulk of the h@xmath0 emission arises in a layer with relatively low temperature @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for a non - dissociative shock , the emission can arise from regions where the h@xmath0 molecules reach significantly higher excitation , with energy levels potentially approaching the dissociation energy @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission arises from molecules that were dissociated in the shock and subsequently reformed on the surfaces of surviving grains . as a corollary",
    ", some of the grains must survive the shock ; this is not inconsistent with the observed lack of mid - infrared aromatic features or continuum from the shock fronts , because larger grains ( which do not produce mid - infrared features or continuum , but do dominate the mass and far - infrared emission of interstellar dust ) may survive the shocks .",
    "the timescale for reformation of h@xmath0 molecules in the physical conditions of the 3c  391 ionic shocks is @xmath58 yr , somewhat longer than the remnant age ; thus , h@xmath0 reformation is probably only partial .",
    "one prediction of this interpretation is that the velocity widths of the h@xmath0 s(3 ) lines will be @xmath59 km  s@xmath12 in the northwest and @xmath60 km  s@xmath12 in the 3c  391:bml region .",
    "the lack of any significant continuum emission or solid - state or macromolecular spectral features in the mid - infrared spectrum suggests that the shocks have destroyed some of the grains .",
    "the mid - infrared emission of unshocked interstellar gas is dominated by solid - state features at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , and 12.6 @xmath1 m due to aromatic hydrocarbons ; these features , combined , produce the emission that was detected almost everywhere by _ iras _",
    "these features are all clearly evident in the isocam cvf spectrum of unshocked gas in figure  [ cvfspec ] .",
    "however , the _ shocked _ gas shows no solid - state features : both the molecular shock ( fig .",
    "[ clumpspec ] ) and the ionic shock ( fig .  [ ionspec ] ) spectra are devoid of aromatic features , despite bright features from the pre - shock and unrelated gas ( fig .",
    "[ cvfspec ] ) .",
    "further , the shocked emission shows no significant continuum rise at long wavelengths .",
    "this rise is normally seen in interstellar dust spectra , including those of quiescent regions like reflection nebulae @xcite .",

    "the total contrast in the 10.811.9 @xmath1 m image is small ; after subtracting 105.8 mjy  sr@xmath12 of zodiacal emission appropriate for this filter and observing location and date , the range is 2940 mjy  sr@xmath12 for the diffuse emission in the region observed by the isocam cvf .",
    "the choice of cvf reference spectrum (  2.1 ) location is relatively clean of structure and typical of the galactic emission for the field .",
    "the low - contrast structure in the 10.811.9 @xmath1 m image includes emission near the southern and northeastern parts of the radio shell .",
    "these enhancements are not coincident with the oh maser locations , nor are they coincident with the 1218 @xmath1 m image .",
    "there is no emission from the bright radio bar in the northwest .",
    "indeed , it is just possible to see an outline of much of the remnant as a ` shadow ' in the 10.811.9 @xmath1 m image .",
    "the ` shadow ' includes the northwestern radio bar and runs all the way from the radio bar along the inside edge of the remnant .",
    "the ` shadow ' does not overlap with 3c  391:bml ; instead , it is interior to the shock as traced by the radio emission and the infrared emission lines .",
    "the origin of the ` shadow ' is unclear",
    ". it could be due to extinction , from unshocked gas .",
    "we suspect that the shadow actually represents a _",
    "deficit _ of grains in the post - shock material .",
    "it is also possible that some faint pah emission occurs outside the radio shell .",
    "the 10.811.9 @xmath1 m image ( fig .",
    "[ figlw8 ] ) may help resolve two other issues for 3c  391 .",
    "first , there is an extension from the remnant in the 1218 @xmath1 m image ( fig .",
    "[ figlw3 ] , described in  2.1 ) , stretching to the south and seemingly doubling the infrared remnant size relative to the radio size .",
    "the 10.811.9 @xmath1 m image is too small to show the entire extension , but there is emission in the lower - right ( southernmost ) part of the 10.811.9 @xmath1 m image , which overlaps with the extension .",
    "thus , it appears that the extension is bright in the aromatic features , whereas the remnant emission is faint in 10.811.9 @xmath1 m and has no aromatic hydrocarbons .",
    "second , the 10.811.9 @xmath1 m image reveals a bright , diffuse peak just north of the eastern oh maser .",
    "this peak may explain why the 1218 @xmath1 m image extends beyond the boundary of the radio shell at this location ; specifically , the 1218 @xmath1 m image contains some contribution from dust continuum that is correlated with the aromatic features traced by the 10.811.9 @xmath1 m image .",
    "both the southwestern extension of the remnant and the northeastern peak are outside of the radio shell , and they are bright in both the 1218 @xmath1 m and 10.811.9 @xmath1 m filters , suggesting they are due to material with very different physical conditions from the post - shock material .",
    "the efficient destruction of small grains is actually counter to what we had expected .",
    "small grains are actually predicted to be _ produced _ in 100 km  s@xmath12 shocks , being shattered fragments of larger grains @xcite .",
    "the far - infrared spectra of molecular supernova remnants revealed dust continuum that was associated with the remnants ; the shocked dust had a warmer far - infrared color temperature suggesting that the grains are probably smaller than the pre - shock grains .",
    "the smallest grains , which would emit in the mid - infrared apparently do not continue the size distribution of grain fragments .",
    "the smaller grains can be destroyed by sputtering in the hot gas behind the shock , and especially fast collisions can vaporize grains rather than shatter them .",
    "our new near- and mid - infrared observations have separated the molecular and ionic shocks in 3c  391 .",
    "the ionic shocks , traced by [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] , follow the nonthermal radio shell and are due to shocks propagating into moderate - density gas .",
    "the ionic shock morphology is filamentary .",
    "there is no continuum or aromatic spectral features in the mid - infrared spectrum of the ionic shocks , despite the presence of bright aromatic features and continuum in the mid - infrared spectrum of regions just outside the shock .",
    "thus the small dust grains and aromatic hydrocarbons are efficiently destroyed in the ionic shocks , contrary to our expectation that small grains would be abundantly produced as fragments of larger grains .",
    "comparing our new observations of 3c  391 to the well - studied remnant ic  443 @xcite , we see they are generally similar , in that parts of the remnant shells are dominated by ionic shocks ( northwest in 3c  391 , northeast in ic  443 ) and parts are dominated by molecular shocks ( southeast in 3c  391 , south in ic  443 ) . for 3c  391 ,",
    "the ionic shocks arise from the location where the supernova remnant is tangent to the surface of a giant molecular cloud , while the molecular shocks are outside the giant molecular cloud . for ic  443",
    ", it has long been assumed that the pre - shock molecular cloud is to the south , where the molecular ridge is located .",
    "our observations show that supernova shocks into a molecular cloud can be ionic shocks through material with density of order @xmath5 to @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "such preshock material is traced by co(@xmath61 ) emission and defines ` molecular clouds ' as traditionally observed . in another molecular - interacting remnant ,",
    "hb  21 , the molecular shocks were also found to be at locations other than the interface between the supernova remnant and molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "the shocks for which h@xmath0 emission dominates the cooling are those into denser material , which has a small filling factor and may or may not be present at the location and time when the blast wave passes through the molecular cloud . in this sense ,",
    "molecular - interacting supernova remnants provide a unique perspective into the structure of molecular clouds .",
    "the region 3c  391:bml , where tracers of molecular shocks including an oh 1720 mhz maser , h@xmath0o and oh far - infrared emission , and wide co and cs mm - wave lines , resolves into a cluster of partially resolved clumps in the near - infrared h@xmath0 image .",
    "the morphology of the molecular shocks is completely different from that of the ionic shocks .",
    "the isocam images show that the molecular emission is confined to the 3c  391:bml region , with the ionic shocks following the radio shell and perhaps even dimming in the region of bright molecular emission .",
    "one of the molecular clumps corresponds precisely with the location of the oh maser .",
    "the clumps most likely are dense cores from the giant molecular cloud within which the progenitor of 3c  391 formed .",
    "they are now revealed in h@xmath0 emission because of the shocks that are being driven through them by the supernova explosion some @xmath62 yr ago .",
    "these dense cores have their outer layers stripped and have somewhat altered chemistry in the shocked regions , potentially impacting their future star formation potential and the type of stars they may form .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained at the hale telescope , palomar observatory , as part of a continuing collaboration between the california institute of technology , nasa / jpl , and cornell university .",
    "this work is also based on observations with iso , an esa project with instruments funded by esa member states ( especially the pi countries : france , germany , the netherlands and the united kingdom ) with the participation of isas and nasa .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
