    "there has been an - ongoing effort to understand the evolution of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) since their basic nature was understood back in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "there are two rather distinct parts of the evolution to consider : ( i ) the formation of a neutron star in orbit with a low - mass donor star , and ( ii ) the subsequent portion of the evolution when mass is transferred from the companion donor star to the neutron star .    the difficulty with the first part of the evolution involves the conceptual problem of keeping the binary system bound while the massive progenitor of the neutron star ( ns ) explodes in a supernova event . a part of this problem was addressed by invoking a common envelope phase during which the lower - mass secondary ejects the envelope of the massive ns progenitor @xcite",
    "however , even this solution is not so straightforward in that there may be insufficient gravitational energy release between the inspiraling low - mass star and the core of the ns progenitor to successfully eject the envelope ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this difficulty could be overcome by invoking secondaries that are of intermediate mass , e.g. , @xmath15 to increase the gravitational energy release ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in turn , there has been a persistent conceptual misunderstanding that the transfer of mass from a star of @xmath16 onto a @xmath17 ns was dynamically unstable .",
    "that was shown to be untrue ( @xcite ; prp02 ; see also @xcite )",
    ".    starting in the 1970 s and continuing until the present , there have been numerous evolution studies of a limited number of lmxbs and imxbs exploring the various paths which lead to very different intermediate and end - stage products .",
    "one of the more systematic was the study by @xcite and @xcite which involved about 150 lmxb and imxb systems .",
    "given the two - dimensional parameter space of initial @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the initial orbital period and mass of the donor star ) , the types of evolutionary paths for lmxbs or imxbs is really quite large and varied .",
    "possibilities include evolution to a minimum orbital period of @xmath1170 min with very low - mass h - rich donor stars ; evolution to an ultracompact state with @xmath2 in the range of @xmath3 minutes and he - rich donors ; and evolution to wide orbits of days - to - months with low - mass giant donor stars .    in order to better understand the many possible evolution paths of lmxbs and imxbs in a more systematic way , we have calculated an extensive grid of binary models encompassing 42,000 initial combinations of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude larger than the study we conducted in 2002 .",
    "we took advantage of a newly developed stellar evolution code whose equations of state allow for the evolution of very low mass stars with cold dense interiors , and a cluster of computers which speeds up the overall calculation beyond what was readily available a decade ago .    with the recent discovery of psr j1614 - 2230 , with the most massive neutron star known ( @xmath20 ) , a relatively close 8.7-day orbit , and a fairly massive white dwarf companion ( @xmath6 ) , we decided to first apply our evolution calculations to understanding the origins of this system .",
    "the specific goals are to understand whether a natal ns with canonical mass of @xmath11@xmath7 can accrete sufficient material to grow to nearly @xmath21 , to see whether the donor star mass is consistent with the observed @xmath2 , and to investigate how this system is related to possible progenitors in the guise of the lmxb ",
    "cyg x-2 . in all",
    ", we found @xmath11500 of our evolution tracks which produce systems that are at least generically related to psr j1614 - 2230 .    in this paper",
    "we introduce our set of binary evolution calculations which cover an extensive grid of initial orbital periods and donor masses (  [ sec : overview ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : psr1614 ] we show how our binary evolution calculations apply directly to psr j1614 - 2230 . in  [ sec : discuss ] we discuss a number of the general lessons we have gleaned from this study .",
    "in this work we start with binary systems with an unevolved companion star in a circular orbit with an already formed neutron star of mass 1.4 @xmath22 .",
    "the prior evolution , leading to the ns and low- or intermediate - mass donor star does not concern us in this study .",
    "however , this prior phase of evolution involves a much more massive progenitor of the ns ( perhaps @xmath23 ) , as well as a common envelope phase that unveils the he / co core of the progenitor which , in turn , evolves to collapse and the formation of a neutron star ( ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the incipient lmxb or imxb is computed with a combination of a newly developed henyey code called `` mesa '' ( modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ; @xcite ) and a binary driver code .",
    "the advantages of mesa for our calculations are that ( i ) it is specifically designed to include equations of state that are able to handle the low - mass and high degree of degeneracy that the donor stars achieve ( see @xcite for details ) , and ( ii ) it is robust when used in a binary evolution code that allows for ` hands - off ' evolution through all the various stages of the donor star and phases of mass transfer .",
    "we found that none of the evolution models failed to run to their expected completion .",
    "the binary driver code evolves the binary orbit , including the effects of mass transfer and angular momentum losses due to gravitational radiation , magnetic braking , and possible mass ejection from the system .",
    "it keeps track of where the roche lobe is in respect to the atmosphere of the donor star being evolved by mesa , and decides how much mass to remove from the donor star during each evolution time step .",
    "it also manages the various disparate timescales involved in the donor star as well as in the evolution of the binary orbit ( details of the driver code will be presented in a future work , but its operation is very similar to that described in @xcite ) . for the specific models presented here , we assumed that for sub - eddington mass transfer rates , 90% of the mass transferred is retained by the neutron star , but that for higher transfer rates the accretion onto the ns was limited to that set by the eddington limit .",
    "matter ejected from the system was assumed to carry away the specific angular momentum of the neutron star .",
    "no tidal evolution ( between the donor star s rotation and the orbital angular momentum ) was incorporated in the code .",
    "we regard this as typically a @xmath24 effect on the evolution , both before mass transfer commences and afterward .",
    "magnetic braking is included ( according to eq.[36 ] in @xcite ) for all stars except those that are completely convective or have a mass @xmath25 . as an approximation",
    ", we also assume that magnetic braking operates even in those cases where the donor star underfills its roche lobe and continuous synchronization between the donor star and the orbit is not guaranteed .",
    "we have verified by numerical experiment that this approximation makes little difference in the final distribution of evolution tracks shown in fig.[fig:43000 ] . in this work",
    "we do not consider either thermal - ionization disk instabilities or the x - ray irradiation of the donor star during the course of the evolution calculations .",
    "their effects can be approximated via the application of after - the - fact algorithms  which we discuss in a future work .",
    "however , for the purposes of the calculations emphasized in this paper , neither effect is very important .",
    "we computed binary evolution tracks for @xmath26 lmxbs and imxbs over a grid of 60 initial donor masses uniformly distributed over the range of @xmath0 and 700 initial orbital periods distributed over the range of @xmath1 hours in equal logarithmic steps . with our dense coverage of the initial binary parameter space , most of the basic types of lmxb and imxb evolutionary tracks are explored .",
    "the `` initial orbital period '' in these runs is defined as @xmath27 following the birth of the neutron star .",
    "the orbits are assumed to be circular , and the donor stars start on the zams in our evolution calculations .",
    "the binary evolution is considered ` complete ' when either ( i ) 10 gyr have elapsed , or ( ii ) the mass transfer becomes dynamically unstable ( this later condition occurs for only @xmath112.4% of our systems , typically the ones with the largest initial donor masses and orbital periods ) . after the envelope of the donor star",
    "has been transferred to the neutron star ( or ejected from the system ) , mesa continues to evolve the relic he or he / co core of the donor until a total elapsed time of 10 gyr has passed .",
    "a graphic presentation of our 38,000 binary evolution tracks , representing lmxbs and imxbs is shown in fig.[fig:43000 ] in the @xmath28 plane .",
    "we divide this plane up into @xmath29 discrete pixels .",
    "as the evolution tracks pass through this plane , we record , in a cumulative fashion , the evolution time that is spent in crossing a given pixel .",
    "when all the tracks have been co - added in this fashion , we display the logarithm of the total accumulated time in a pixel with color shading .",
    "the cumulative dwell times per pixel range from @xmath30 yr for the red regions to @xmath31 yr for the purple .",
    "the red box in the upper right of the diagram outlines the starting grid of initial models .    to better understand",
    "what the different types of lmxb and imxb evolutions contribute to diagram , we show in fig.[fig : ransom_like ] a set of illustrative individual tracks , labeled `` cv '' , `` uc '' , `` g1 '' , and `` g2 '' . the cv - like tracks are analogous to the evolution of cataclysmic variables , where the donor star is not very evolved at the time when mass transfer commences , remains h - rich , and gets eaten away by mass transfer until the orbital period reaches a minimum ( at @xmath1170 min . ) , after which the orbit slowly expands ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these systems commence mass transfer for @xmath2 shorter than the so - called ` bifurcation period ' of between @xmath11@xmath32 hrs ( depending on the initial donor mass ) .",
    "the ultracompact systems ( `` uc '' ) start mass transfer in somewhat wider orbits , very near the bifurcation period , with the donor stars correspondingly more evolved , typically with h just having been depleted at the stellar center ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of the high he content in the core of the donor star , these systems are able to evolve to much shorter orbital periods ( some as short as 6 min . ) finally , those systems that commence mass transfer in even wider orbits ( e.g. , `` g1 '' and `` g2 '' ) , lead to the formation of a well - defined he core and to an increase in orbital period . for those donor stars which start with @xmath33 , their degenerate cores prescribe a mass - radius relation , which in turn dictates an orbital period - core mass relation , @xmath34 , which is clearly delineated by the locus of green terminus points in fig.[fig:43000 ] which follows the @xmath34 relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for donor stars with initial masses @xmath35",
    ", however , this @xmath34 relation does not have to be followed , and their evolution typically terminates considerably before this @xmath34 boundary is reached .",
    "this is compounded by the fact that , due to the high mass ratios involved , the initial phases of the mass transfer , while dynamically stable , are governed by the thermal timescale of the donor star ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; prp02 ; for further references see  [ sec : psrevol ] ) .",
    "these rates can therefore become greater than @xmath36 yr@xmath37 , which is far in excess of the eddington limit for a ns .",
    "therefore , the mass transfer is highly non - conservative , and most of the mass is ejected from the system .",
    "the latter class of systems , we believe , is responsible for the evolution of both cyg x-2 and psr 1614 - 2230 .    in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will concentrate on various other aspects of these evolutionary paths and describe in greater detail the various types of lmxbs and recycled pulsars that they lead to . for the present work we focus on the evolutionary paths leading to cyg x-2-like systems and psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "psr j1614@xmath382230 @xcite is a millisecond radio pulsar in an @xmath39 day orbit around a ( presumably ) predominantly carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarf ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the recent measurement of the shapiro delay in psr j1614@xmath382230 has yielded a ns mass of @xmath41 , making it the most massive pulsar known to date @xcite .",
    "given the constituent masses and @xmath42 days , this recycled pulsar system shows all the signs of having descended from an lmxb very much like cyg x-2 ( @xmath43 days , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the orbital eccentricity of @xmath11@xmath46 indicates that the evolution involved an extensive period of mass transfer via a roche - lobe filling donor star .",
    "the characteristic spin - down age is @xmath115 gyr .",
    "because of the very interesting and unique system parameters of psr j1614 - 2230 , we were motivated to search our grid of tracks for all those systems which terminate their evolution with @xmath47 day and @xmath48 . in all , there were 515 such systems ; their evolution in the @xmath49 plane is shown in fig.[fig : ransom_like ] as light blue and green tracks .",
    "note that they all start with donor masses in the range of @xmath50 , and @xmath18 in the range of @xmath51 days .",
    "note how the light blue tracks all _ decrease _ in @xmath2 until the donor mass reaches @xmath11@xmath21 , after which @xmath2 increases again until mass transfer has ceased when the donor star no longer has an extended envelope .",
    "the initial decrease in @xmath2 results from the fact that mass is being transferred from the more massive donor to the less massive ns .",
    "the total duration of the light blue portion of the tracks corresponds to a characteristic evolution time of only @xmath11 a myr .",
    "this rapid phase of mass transfer is referred to as `` thermal timescale '' mass transfer since it takes place on the thermal timescale of the radiative donor star that is more massive than the accreting ns ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; prp02 ; for other related references see below in ",
    "[ sec : psrevol ] ) .",
    "once the donor masses reach @xmath11@xmath52 the thermal timescale mass transfer is over , and the evolution slows down to timescales of tens of myr - the nuclear evolution timescale of the donors ( see the green and yellow portions of the tracks in fig.[fig : ransom_like ] ) .",
    "we have selected one of these 515 tracks , as illustrative , in that its end product best matches the properties of psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "we show details of that particular evolution in fig.[fig : details_evol ] .",
    "the various panels show the evolution of @xmath2 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and information on the chemical composition of the donor ( star 2 ) , as functions of the evolution time .",
    "a reference time of 262 myr has been subtracted from the evolution time to enhance the short - timescale features around the mass - transfer phases .",
    "note that @xmath57 refers to the mass loss rate from the donor star ,    the short - lived drop in @xmath2 ( panel a ) corresponds to the thermal timescale mass transfer event ( the large spike in @xmath57 in panel e ) . in panel ( f )",
    "we see that the central h mass fraction is only @xmath116% by the time mass transfer commences .",
    "the relatively long plateau in @xmath57 ( panel e ) at @xmath11@xmath58 yr@xmath37 which lasts for @xmath1135 myr , corresponds to the phase of mass transfer driven by nuclear evolution during which time the remainder of the h in the core and much of the envelope is largely consumed .",
    "once a he core has formed , there is an approximately 4-myr interval during which h - shell burning occurs .",
    "this causes the radius of the donor star to expand from @xmath11@xmath59 to @xmath11@xmath60 , during which time the mass transfer rate ranges between @xmath61 yr@xmath37 .",
    "the orbital period increases from @xmath113 days to @xmath119 days , and the donor - star mass drops to @xmath62 .",
    "it is during this second phase of mass transfer when the accreting ns undergoes its largest growth in mass .",
    "after the h - shell burning phase , the donor star contracts , roche lobe contact and the mass - transfer phase is over , and the he in the core of the donor burns to c and o. the companion , which ends up being 90% c and o ( with 10% of the mass in a he envelope ) , contracts to its final degenerate radius of @xmath63 .",
    "this entire evolution is sometimes referred to as `` case ab '' since the mass transfer occurs near the end of the main sequence .",
    "( for a closely related evolution scenario for cyg x-2 see @xcite . ) and is not the same as the mass accreted by the ns .    to put the evolution of psr j1614 - 2230 into some context , we show in fig.[fig : nsmass ] a plot of the _ end points _ of all the binary evolutions we ran in the plane of the final neutron - star mass vs.the final donor - star mass ( now a white dwarf )  with @xmath64 restricted to @xmath65 hr . in all",
    ", there are some 14,000 system end points represented in this figure .",
    "even though the points form patterns and lie along pseudo tracks , it is important to note that they are _ not _ evolution tracks , but rather _ end points _ of numerous evolutions",
    ". these patterns result from the discrete nature of the grid of starting values for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the location of psr j1614 - 2230 is marked with an orange square .",
    "the end point locations in this @xmath66 plane are color coded according the final value of the orbital period .",
    "the heavy green dots correspond to @xmath64 in the range of @xmath67 day , roughly commensurate with @xmath2 of psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "the vertical column of heavy green dots originates from systems with initial donor - star masses @xmath68 which follow the core - mass radius relation ( see discussion below ) , and where the mass transfer rates are well below the eddington limit .",
    "thus , the nss in these systems are able to grow substantially . for higher - mass donors ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) that commence mass transfer near the end of the main sequence ( case ab ) , the final ns masses lie in the range of @xmath11@xmath70 with white dwarf masses inversely correlated with the ns mass , and lying between @xmath110.26 and @xmath71 ( the continuing line of heavy green dots ) .",
    "the line of systems with the most massive white dwarfs ( between 0.5 and 0.65 @xmath22 ) arise from case b mass transfer ( where the initial donor masses were @xmath72 ) , but their companion ns masses are all @xmath73 .    this ` competition ' between the ns mass and that of the residual white dwarf companion is due to the fact that , in general , the more the donor star is evolved ( hence larger core masses ) when mass transfer commences , the higher is the thermal - timescale mass - transfer rate , and therefore the lower the mass retention fraction by the ns ( where the eddington limit is greatly exceeded ) .",
    "more specifically , the case b mass - transfer systems have only a thermal - timescale mass - transfer phase , and there is no sub - eddington phase during which the ns mass can grow significantly . therefore , raising an initial ns mass of @xmath7 to @xmath21 remains a difficulty for the model ( see also prp02 ) .",
    "the relation between the final orbital periods and the white dwarf companion masses of the systems ending with @xmath74 hours is shown in fig.[fig : pmplane ] . again",
    ", these are 14,000 _ end points _ , and not evolution tracks .",
    "the location of psr j1614 - 2230 is marked .",
    "the systems lying along the leftmost boundary of these end points ( marked with a solid line ) all represent he white dwarfs of mass between @xmath11@xmath75 and @xmath11@xmath76 .",
    "these systems form from donor stars of initial mass @xmath77 , and are well represented by a nearly unique @xmath34 relation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dashed line to the left of this set of end points is the expression given by @xcite which was already known to systematically somewhat underestimate the white dwarf mass for systems with short orbital periods below which the relationship was not designed to work .",
    "the solid line is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the white dwarf mass expressed in solar units .",
    "we devised this expression to fit both the results shown in fig.[fig : pmplane ] for low - mass white dwarfs and to incorporate the expression of @xcite which extends all the way to white dwarfs of mass @xmath80 .",
    "the systems distinctly to the right of this @xmath34 relation originate from donor stars with @xmath81 and do not follow the core mass - radius relation for giants . note the `` gap '' in these more massive white dwarfs ( which runs approximately at @xmath11@xmath82 ) dividing systems that evolved in so - called case ab ( on the left side ) from those that formed from somewhat more evolved donors at the time mass transfer commences , i.e. , case b. these white dwarfs become progressively more co - rich in composition toward the higher masses .",
    "( for other related studies see , e.g. , @xcite ; prp02 ; @xcite . )    finally , in this regard , we note that psr j1614 - 2230 is quite representative of the systems which started with donors of mass @xmath83 and ended up with white dwarfs of mass in the range @xmath84 .",
    "the mass transfer rate in case b systems ( toward the right ) is so high that the neutron stars do not have much chance of growing to interestingly high masses .",
    "by contrast , the systems to the left of the ` gap ' between cases ab and b have intervals of near- or sub - eddington rates which allow the highest mass nss to be grown ( see fig.[fig : nsmass ] ) . in general , the higher - mass neutron stars tend to be found with the lower - mass white dwarfs .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , none of our evolution tracks , starting with neutron stars of canonical mass @xmath7 , produced the observed @xmath85  m@xmath86 ns with the requisite combination of orbital period and white dwarf mass to match the psr j1614 - 2230 system .",
    "neutron stars as massive as @xmath21 , and higher , were produced with the correct orbital period , but not in combination with a massive enough white dwarf .",
    "similarly , the orbital period and white dwarf mass combination is easy to reproduce , but not with the correct @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the final values of @xmath55 and @xmath87 are anticorrelated when @xmath2 is fixed to @xmath88 day .",
    "the difficulty with producing high - mass nss in orbit with massive white dwarf companions is that the progenitors of these white dwarfs are initially substantially more massive than the ns , resulting in very rapid , thermal - timescale mass transfer ( at rates as high as @xmath89 yr@xmath37 ) .",
    "unless this is followed by a substantial interval of sub- or near - eddington accretion rate , the neutron star will likely be prevented from accreting a significant fraction of the donor star s mass .",
    "one obvious solution to this problem of producing more massive nss is to start with higher natal mass neutron stars . to this end",
    ", we have run a series of smaller subgrids of 700 additional starting models with initially higher - mass neutron stars .",
    "we find that the minimum required initial mass neutron star for which we could reach a final ns mass of @xmath90 turned out to be @xmath91 .",
    "the starting donor mass for these more ` successful ' models , however , increased to @xmath11@xmath92 ( compared to @xmath11@xmath93 ) , the initial orbital periods remained near @xmath11@xmath13 hours , and the final companion co white dwarf mass was @xmath11@xmath94 , somewhat closer to the observed value .",
    "an illustrative evolution sequence that produces a @xmath11@xmath95 ns , and otherwise closely resembles psr j1614 - 2230 , is shown in fig.[fig : success ] .    finally , in regard to setting a limit on the mass of the natal neutron star ,",
    "we note an important caveat . throughout our calculations we adopted a very simple prescription for the eddington - limit rate of accretion onto the neutron star of @xmath96 yr@xmath37 , independent of the neutron star mass or radius , or the chemical composition of the accreted material . for most of the evolutionary phases we covered in our 42,000 tracks ,",
    "the accretion rate is either below @xmath97 yr@xmath37 , in which case the value we choose for @xmath98 is unimportant , or it so high , during the thermal timescale mass - transfer phases , that the choice of @xmath99 also does not affect the very small fraction of mass that can be retained by the neutron star .",
    "however , for the production of systems that resemble psr j1614 - 2230 , with its massive neutron star and other specific properties , the largest growth of the neutron star occurs during the second phase of mass transfer in case ab evolution where @xmath57 is in the critical range of @xmath100 yr@xmath37 , and where the value of @xmath98 very much affects how much the neutron star can grow . adjusting the value of @xmath98 to be `` more correct ''",
    "is complicated by the following issues : ( i ) the unknown radius of the ns ( by a factor of @xmath11@xmath101 ) , ( ii ) general relativistic corrections ( of @xmath1120% ) , ( iii ) unknown allowed factors by which the eddington limit may be violated in ns accretion ( of @xmath11 factors of 2 ) , and ( iv ) changes in chemical composition of the accreted material  which is especially important as the material becomes he - rich later in the evolution .",
    "also , the amount of mass gained by the ns is only some @xmath1180% of what was transferred through the accretion disk due to the loss of rest mass that is radiated away . taking all these factors into account",
    ", we have run a range of tests and have concluded that such effects and their uncertainties , lead to an uncertainty in the minimum mass for a neutron star to reach 1.97 @xmath22 of @xmath11@xmath102 . therefore , the range of required minimum neutron star masses could conceivably be expanded to @xmath103 @xmath22 .",
    "we have used mesa to compute a large grid of 42,000 binary evolution models for lmxbs and imxbs .",
    "we showed the broad sweep of possible evolutions , from systems which attain orbital periods as short as 6 minutes to those which grow to long - period binaries with giant donor stars .",
    "we leave a detailed discussion of the bulk of these results for a future paper . here",
    "we have focused on what we can learn about the evolutionary paths to the newly discovered binary pulsar , psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "we have selected a subset of the evolution models ( 515 in total ) which lead to systems like psr j1614 - 2230 and its evolutionary cousin , cyg x-2 , to examine in more detail . in particular , we show how an orbital period of 8.7-days can be easily understood , as can the @xmath6 companion star . we show that for the proposed scenario , the degenerate companion star is mostly ( i.e. , 90% ) c and o ( with a surrounding shell of he which comprises 10% of the white - dwarf mass ) , but there is also a thin outer envelope that is composed of @xmath1115% h.    we found , however , that starting with neutron stars of canonical mass @xmath7 , we were not able to produce the observed @xmath85  m@xmath86 ns with the requisite combination of orbital period _ and _ white dwarf mass to match the psr j1614 - 2230 system .",
    "we were able to evolve neutron stars as massive as @xmath21 , with the correct orbital period , but not in combination with a massive enough white dwarf . also , the orbital period and white dwarf mass combination was easy to generate , but not with the correct @xmath2 . as discussed above ,",
    "the difficulty with evolving high - mass nss in orbit with massive white dwarf companions is that the progenitors of these white dwarfs are initially substantially more massive than the ns , resulting in very rapid , thermal - timescale mass transfer ( greatly in excess of the eddington limit ) , and the neutron star is thereby prevented from accreting a significant fraction of the donor star s mass .    at this time",
    ", we are therefore tentatively led to conclude that the initial mass of the ns would have to have been higher than the canonical value of @xmath7 in order to declare that the binary evolution of this system is fully understood . by running some 700 supplementary models with initially higher - mass nss",
    ", we found that to successfully produce a system like psr j1614 - 2230 requires a minimum initial neutron star mass of at least @xmath104 , as well as initial donor masses and @xmath2 of @xmath11@xmath12 and @xmath11@xmath13 hrs , respectively .    for completeness in regard to producing high neutron - star masses ,",
    "we point out that a number of the dynamically stable case b evolution tracks that we have generated yield mass transfer rates in excess of several times @xmath105 yr@xmath37 that last for intervals of several thousand years .",
    "if ` hypercritical accretion ' , where the gravitational energy is carried off in neutrinos and the eddington limit is thereby circumvented , is able to occur during these intervals ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then perhaps there is a chance for the neutron stars to grow during this phase of the evolution .",
    "however , it is not clear to us that the hypercritical accretion scenario , which was developed for spherical accretion onto a neutron star , would be applicable to accretion via a disk ( but , see * ? ? ?",
    "a more general conclusion from this l / imxb study is that there is a subclass of systems which start with intermediate mass donor stars ( of @xmath106 ) , with @xmath2 well above the ` bifurcation period ' ( in the range of @xmath51 days ) , which leads to systems like cyg x-2 and psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "such systems terminate their mass transfer before the donor star develops a degenerate core , and they end up with @xmath2 well below the @xmath107 relation .",
    "( see also @xcite ; prp02 ; @xcite ) .",
    "another important general lesson that we can take from this broad look at l / imxb evolution is that _ intermediate_-mass donor stars can evolve to virtually all the known types of lmxb systems that exist at the current epoch .",
    "these include cv - like evolution paths , ultracompact x - ray binaries , and systems with giant donor stars .",
    "this is an important finding because it is significantly easier for intermediate - mass stars to successfully eject the envelope of their massive companion progenitors of the nss , and then remain bound during the ensuing supernova explosion .",
    "finally , we have provided a perspective on where in the @xmath27 and white dwarf mass plane we can expect to find the he white dwarfs that follow the @xmath34 relation , as well as where the systems with the most massive neutron stars should be found .",
    "depending on the upper mass limit to a neutron star , @xmath108 , fig.[fig : nsmass ] shows that there should be a fair number of black holes with mass between @xmath109 and @xmath11@xmath110 in binaries with he or he / co white dwarfs that range between @xmath110.2 and 0.4 @xmath22 and with orbital periods in the range of @xmath111 days .",
    "one way to detect such important relics of stellar evolution is to search for white dwarfs with interestingly high orbital velocities ( i.e. , @xmath112 km s@xmath37 ) and unseen companions .",
    "an important caveat to this is that if such low - mass black holes form in significant numbers in lmxbs that are still undergoing mass transfer , they would be directly detected by their accretion .",
    "however , there is no evidence for lmxbs with low - mass black holes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
