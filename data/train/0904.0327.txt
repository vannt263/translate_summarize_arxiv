    "such equations find their most significant physical realization as models of large - area laser cavities , where the cq combination of the loss and gain is provided by the integration of linear amplifiers and saturable absorbers @xcite .    in most above - mentioned works @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , localized pulses and vortices",
