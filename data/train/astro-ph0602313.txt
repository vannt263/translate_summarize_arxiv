    "* ) but no reports exist for sne ia . dust _ destruction _",
    "is intrinsically linked to sn activity , through sputtering in gas heated by energetic blast waves and through betatron acceleration in radiative shocks @xcite .",
    "dust destruction in snrs can be studied by its strong influence on thermal ir emission from collisionally heated dust .",
    "the iras all sky survey provided fundamental data on galactic snrs @xcite .",
    "this prompted extensive theoretical work on dust heating , emission , and destruction within hot plasmas , summarized by @xcite .",
    "theory is broadly consistent with iras observations , but limitations of those observations ( low spatial and spectral resolution and confusion with the galactic ir background ) precluded any detailed comparisons . in particular , while it is clear that thermal dust emission is prevalent in snrs , our understanding of dust destruction is quite poor .",
    "to examine the nature of dust heating and destruction in the interstellar medium , we conducted an imaging survey with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "( sst ) of 39 snrs in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "we have selected a subset of our detections , four remnants of type ia supernovae , to address questions of dust formation in type ia ejecta , dust content of the diffuse ism of the lmc , and dust destruction in snr shocks .",
    "both dem l71 ( 0505 - 67.9 ; rakowski , ghavamian , & hughes 2003 ) and 054870.4 ( hendrick , borkowski , & reynolds 2003 ) show x - ray evidence for iron - rich ejecta in the interior , and both have well - studied balmer emission from nonradiative shocks @xcite .",
    "two smaller remnants , 050967.5 and 051969.0 , also show prominent h@xmath2 and ly@xmath3 emission from nonradiative shocks ( tuohy et al .",
    "1982 ; smith et al .  1991 ; ghavamian et al . 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "there appears to be little or no optical contribution from radiative shocks .",
    "confusion in ir is widespread in the lmc , but our remnants are less confused than typical , easing the task of separating snr emission from background .",
    "we observed all four objects in all four bands of the infrared array camera ( irac ) , as well as with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) at 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath0 m .",
    "the 160 @xmath0 m images contain only emission from the general ism , so we do not discuss them here .",
    "each irac observation totaled 300 s ( 10 30-s frames ) ; at 24 @xmath0 m , 433 s total ( 14 frames ) ; and at 70 @xmath0 m , 986 s total ( 94 frames ) for all but 054870.4 , for which we observed a total of 546 s in 52 frames .",
    "the observations took place between november 2004 and april 2005 .",
    "images are shown in figure  [ images ] .",
    "confusion from widely distributed warm dust made many 70 @xmath0 m observations problematic , but we obtained useful data on both dem l71 and 054870.4 .",
    "mips images were processed from basic calibrated data ( bcd ) to post - bcd ( pbcd ) by v.  11 of the ssc pbcd pipeline .",
    "for the 24 @xmath0 m images , we then re - mosaicked the stack of bcd images into a pbcd mosaic using the ssc - provided software mopex , specifically the overlap correction , to rid the images of artifacts .",
    "for the 70 @xmath0 m data , we used the contributed software package gert , provided also by the ssc , to remove some vertical streaking .",
    "irac images were also reprocessed using mopex to rid the image of artifacts caused by bright stars .",
    "all four remnants were clearly detected at 24 @xmath0 m , with fluxes from indicated regions reported in table  [ fluxtable ] .",
    "as figure  1 shows , emission is clearly associated with the x - ray - delineated blast wave , though not with interior x - ray emission .",
    "since we expect line emission from fine - structure transitions of low - ionization material to be a significant contributor only in cooler , denser regions identified by radiative shocks , we conclude that the emission we detect is predominantly from heated dust .",
    "none of our objects was clearly detected at 8 @xmath0 m , with fairly stringent upper limits shown in table  [ fluxtable ] .",
    "we modeled the observed emission assuming collisionally heated dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the models allow an arbitrary grain - size distribution , and require as input parameters the hot gas density @xmath4 , electron temperature @xmath5 , ion temperature @xmath6 , and shock sputtering age @xmath7 .",
    "the models use an improved version of the code described by @xcite , including a method devised by @xcite to account for transiently - heated grains , whose temperature fluctuates with time and therefore radiate far more efficiently .",
    "the energy deposition rates by electrons and protons were calculated according to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used dust emissivities based on bulk optical constants of @xcite .",
    "our non - detections in irac bands showed that small grains are destroyed , so it was not necessary to model emission features from small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) grains .",
    "the preshock grain size distribution was taken from the `` provisional '' dust model of @xcite , consisting of separate carbonaceous and silicate grain populations , in particular their average lmc model with maximal amount of small carbonaceous grains .",
    "sputtering rates are based on sputtering cross sections of @xcite , augmented by calculations of an enhancement in sputtering yields for small grains by @xcite .",
    "we have modeled 1-d shocks , that is , superposed emission from regions of varying sputtering age from zero up to a specified shock age @xcite .    to estimate shock parameters",
    ", we used the non - radiative shock models of ghavamian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to model the broad component h@xmath2 widths and broad - to - narrow h@xmath2 flux ratios measured by @xcite and @xcite for the lmc snrs .",
    "results for electron and proton temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath8 are quoted in table  [ inputs ] . for 050967.5",
    ", we assumed @xmath9 at the shock front , consistent with the observed ly@xmath3 fwhm of 3700 km s@xmath10 ( ghavamian et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) . for sedov dynamics",
    ", the sputtering age @xmath11 ( which is also the ionization timescale ) reaches a maximum of about @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the true age of the blast wave @xcite .",
    "therefore we use an `` effective sputtering age '' of @xmath14 when calculating effects of sputtering .",
    "these two remnants have been well - studied in x - rays ( dem l71 : rakowski et al .",
    "2003 ; 054870.4 , hendrick et al .",
    "they have ages of 4400 and 7100 yr , respectively , derived from sedov models . for dem l71 , ghavamian et al .",
    "( 2003 ) were able to infer shock velocities over much of the periphery , ranging from 430 to 960 km s@xmath10 , consistent with x - ray inferences @xcite .    to model dem l71 , we used parameters deduced from _",
    "observations @xcite , averaged over the entire blast wave since different subregions were fairly similar .",
    "we find a predicted 70/24 ratio in the absence of sputtering ( @xmath15 ) of about 2.3 ( including only grains larger than 0.001 @xmath0 m in radius ) , compared to the observed 5.1 .",
    "using an effective age of 1/3 the sedov age gave a value of 5.1 .",
    "table  [ results ] also gives the total dust mass we derive , and the total ir luminosity produced by the model .",
    "for 054870.4 , both the east and west limbs and some bright knots of interior emission are visible at 24 @xmath0 m , but only the north half of the east limb is clearly detected at 70 @xmath0 m . only fluxes from this region were measured ; the results are summarized in table  [ fluxtable ] . using a 1-d model for coulomb heating of electrons by protons",
    ", we calculate a mean electron temperature in the shock region of @xmath16 kev .",
    "a model using the postshock density of 0.72 @xmath17 obtained by hendrick et al .  ( 2003 ) for the whole limb ( including sputtering ) gives too high a 70/24 @xmath0 m ratio .",
    "that ratio is very sensitive to density ; we found that increasing @xmath18 by a factor @xmath19 adequately reproduced the observed ratio .",
    "that fitted density appears in table  [ inputs ] and the corresponding results are in table  [ results ] .",
    "gas mass was derived from the x - ray emission measure of the east limb @xcite , scaled to the region shown in figure  1 , and using electron density in table  [ inputs ] .",
    "our other two objects are much smaller ; x - ray data suggest young ages @xcite .",
    "detections of light echoes @xcite indicate an age of about 400 yr for 050967.5 and about 600 yr for 051969.0 , with @xmath20% errors .",
    "much higher shock velocities inferred by ghavamian et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) mean that plasma heating should be much more effective .",
    "higher dust temperatures , hence lower 70/24 @xmath0 m ratios , should result .",
    "in fact , we did not detect either remnant at 70 @xmath0 m , with upper limits on the ratio considerably lower than the other two detections ( table  [ fluxtable ] ) .    in the case of 0509 - 67.5",
    ", optical - uv observations fix only @xmath8 , so we regarded the density @xmath18 as a free parameter , fixing @xmath11 at @xmath14 and finding @xmath5 assuming no collisionless heating .",
    "our 70 @xmath0 m upper limit gives a lower limit on @xmath18 , shown in table  [ inputs ] , as well as an upper limit on the total dust mass ( table  [ results ] ) .",
    "the analysis of 0519 - 69.0 was identical to that done for 0509 - 67.5 .",
    "however , for 0519 - 69.0 we divided the remnant up into two regions : the three bright knots ( which we added together and considered one region , accounting for 20% of the total flux ) and the rest of the blast wave . optical spectroscopy ( ghavamian et al .",
    "2006 ) allowed determination of parameters separately for the knots and the remainder .",
    "again regarding @xmath18 , @xmath5 and @xmath11 as free parameters , we place lower limits on the post - shock densities and @xmath5 , and upper limits on the amount of dust mass , including sputtering . for both remnants ,",
    "density limits assume the effective sputtering age ; if there is no sputtering at all , we obtain firm lower limits on density lower by less than a factor of 2 .",
    "the ir emission in the balmer - dominated snrs in the lmc is spatially coincident with the blast wave .",
    "it is produced within the shocked ism by the swept - up lmc dust heated in collisions with thermal electrons and protons .",
    "we find no evidence for infrared emission associated with either shocked or unshocked ejecta of these thermonuclear snrs .",
    "while detailed modeling of small grains is required to make a quantitative statement , apparently little or no dust forms in such explosions , and any line emission produced by ejecta is below our detection limit .",
    "this is consistent with observations of type ia sne where dust formation has never been observed .",
    "it is also consistent with the absence in meteorites of presolar grains formed in type ia explosions @xcite .",
    "the measured 70/24 @xmath21 mips ratios in dem l71 and 0548 - 70.4 , and the absence of detectable emission in the irac bands in all 4 snrs , can be accounted for with dust models which include destruction of small grains . without dust destruction ,",
    "numerous small grains present in the lmc ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would produce too much emission at short wavelengths when transiently heated to high temperatures by energetic particles .",
    "destruction of small grains is required to reproduce the observed 70/24 @xmath21 mips ratios in dem l71 and 0548 - 70.4 : 90%  of the mass in grains smaller than 0.030.04 @xmath0 m is destroyed in our models .",
    "even with this destruction , we infer pre - sputtering dust / gas mass far smaller than the 0.25% in the weingartner & draine model .",
    "the two young remnants , 050967.5 and 051969.0 , have been detected only at 24 @xmath21 , but our rather stringent upper limits at 70 @xmath21 suggest the presence of much hotter dust than in the older snrs dem l71 and 0548 - 70.4 . such hot dust is produced in our plane shock models only if the postshock electron densities exceed @xmath22 @xmath17 and 3.47.7 @xmath17 in 050967.5 and 051969.0 , respectively ( table  [ inputs ] ) .",
    "050967.5 is asymmetric , and the quoted lower density limit needs to be reduced if an average postshock electron density representative of the whole snr is of interest .",
    "we measure a flux ratio of 5 between the bright and faint hemispheres , depending primarily on the gas density ratio between the hemispheres , and on the ratio of swept - up ism masses . for",
    "equal swept - up masses , our models reproduce the observed ratio for a density contrast of 3 or less ; the actual density contrast is lower because more mass has been swept up in the brighter hemisphere .",
    "the nearly circular shape of 050967.5 also favors a low density contrast .",
    "the densities derived here are several times higher than an upper limit to the postshock density of @xmath23 @xmath17 obtained by @xcite who used hydrodynamical models of @xcite to interpret _ chandra _ x - ray observations of this snr .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is currently unknown .",
    "possible causes include : ( 1 ) neglect of extreme temperature grain fluctuations in our dust models for 050967.5 , ( 2 ) modification of the blast wave by cosmic rays as suggested for the tycho snr by @xcite , ( 3 ) contribution of line emission in the 24 @xmath21 mips band .    the measured 24 and 70 @xmath21 ir fluxes , in combination with estimates of the swept - up gas from x - ray observations ,",
    "imply a dust / gas ratio a factor of several lower than typically assumed for the lmc . in order to resolve this discrepancy",
    ", one needs much higher dust destruction rates and/or a much lower dust / gas ratio in the pre - shock gas .",
    "most determinations of dust mass come from higher - density regions , but type ia snrs are generally located in the diffuse ism , where densities are low .",
    "both the dust content and the grain size distribution might be different in the diffuse ism . in the milky way",
    ", the dust content is lower in the more diffuse ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most likely due to dust destruction by sputtering in fast snr shocks ( more prevalent at low ism densities ) and by grain - grain collisions in slower radiative shocks .",
    "grain - grain collisions are the more likely destruction mechanism for large grains @xcite , so such grains might be less common in the diffuse ism .",
    "smaller grains are more efficiently destroyed by sputtering in snrs , so dust destruction will be more efficient for a steeper preshock grain size distribution ( more weighted toward small grains ) . this in combination with the lower than average preshock dust content mostly likely accounts for the observed deficit of dust in the balmer - dominated snrs in the lmc .",
    "apparently dust in the ambient medium near these snrs has been already affected ( and partially destroyed ) by shock waves prior to its present encounter with fast snr blast waves .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up is required in order to confirm preliminary conclusions presented in this work and learn more about dust and its destruction in the diffuse ism of the lmc .",
