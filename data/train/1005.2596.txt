    "the nmr signature of spin - precessing modes of superfluid a - like phase immersed in a uniaxially deformed aerogel attracts vivid interest . an important information was collected from nmr spectra of the a - like phase in axially compressed @xcite and axially stretched @xcite cases . in this situation the orbital anisotropy axis @xmath1 of the order parameter of superfluid @xmath2he - a is pinned either along cylindrical axis ( in axially compressed aerogel ) , or in the transverse plane ( in axially stretched aerogel ) .",
