    "the lightest scalar mesons @xmath5 and @xmath6 , discovered more than thirty years ago , became the hard problem for the naive quark - antiquark ( @xmath7 ) model from the outset .",
    "really , on the one hand the almost exact degeneration of the masses of the isovector @xmath5 and isoscalar @xmath6 states revealed seemingly the structure similar to the structure of the vector @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons , and on the other hand the strong coupling of @xmath6 with the @xmath10 channel pointed unambiguously to a considerable part of the strange quark pair @xmath11 in the wave function of @xmath6 .",
    "it was noted late in the 1970s that in the mit bag model there are light four - quark scalar states and suggested that @xmath5 and @xmath6 might be these states @xcite . from that time @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "resonances came into beloved children of the light quark spectroscopy , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "ten years later there was proposed in ref.@xcite to study radiative @xmath12 decays @xmath13 and @xmath14 to solve the puzzle of the lightest scalar mesons . over the next ten years before the experiments ( 1998 ) , this question was examined from different points of view @xcite .",
    "now these decays have been studied not only theoretically but also experimentally .",
    "the first measurements have been reported by the snd @xcite and cmd-2 @xcite collaborations which obtain the following branching ratios @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 more recently the kloe collaboration has measured @xcite @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 in agreement with the novosibirsk data @xcite but with a considerably smaller error .    in this work we present the new analysis of the recent kloe data on the @xmath0 decay @xcite . in contradistinction to @xcite , we    \\1 ) treat the @xmath2 mass @xmath22 as a free parameter of the fit ;    \\2 ) fit the phase @xmath23 of the interference between @xmath13 ( signal ) and @xmath24 ( background ) reactions ;    \\3 ) use new more precise experimental values of the input parameters .    all formulas for the @xmath25 reaction taking the background into account",

    "@xcite , that the relation between branching ratios of @xmath2 and @xmath153 production in @xmath12 radiative decays essentially depends on a @xmath160 mass splitting .",
    "this strong mass dependence is the result of gauge invariance , the ( photon energy)@xmath84 law on the right slope of the resonance .",
    "our present analysis confirms this conclusion .",
    "note that a noticeable deviation from the naive four - quark model equality @xmath158 is not crucial .",
    "what is more important is the mechanism of the production of the @xmath2 and @xmath153 through the charged kaon loop , i.e. the four - quark transition .",
    "as is shown in ref.@xcite , this gives strong evidence in favor of the four - quark model of the @xmath161 .",
    "note that the constant @xmath162 also can differ a lot from those obtained in @xcite .",
    "the point is that the extraction of this constant is very model dependent .",
    "for example , fitting with taking into account the mixing of the resonances can decrease the value of @xmath162 considerably .",
    "for instance , fitting the data of @xcite without mixing one has @xmath163",

    "note also that in @xcite the phase @xmath165 of the background is taken from the work @xcite , where it is obtained by the simultaneous fitting the @xmath166 spectrum and the phase @xmath167 of the @xmath168 scattering , taking into account the mixing of the resonances . in @xcite",
