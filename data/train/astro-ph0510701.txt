    "early type stars ( o- , early b- , wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ) are hot stars ( @xmath3  k ) with masses @xmath4 .",
    "they are known to possess some of the strongest sustained winds among galactic objects . as a class wolf - rayet stars have the highest known mass loss @xmath5yr of any stellar type .",
    "the supersonic winds of massive stars may reach terminal velocities of @xmath6  km / s @xcite , their kinetic energy @xmath7 , however , rarely exceed 1% of the bolometric radiative energy output of typically @xmath8  erg / s .    in recent years",
    "massive stars have been connected to several high energy phenomena : they are suspected to be the progenitor of some type of @xmath0-ray bursts @xcite , and are known to be an interacting medium for the blast wave expelled from supernova explosions .",
    "triggered by the detections of several @xmath0-ray sources by egret that are not unambiguously identified yet but found in positional coincident with massive binary systems @xcite , and motivated by the detection of synchrotron radiation from the collision region in some massive binaries , these systems have also been proposed as potential sites of non - thermal high - energy photon production @xcite .    unlike in a wind of a single massive star where particles has been proposed to be accelerated by either multiple weak shocks from line - driven instabilities @xcite to compensate for the expansion and radiative losses even close to the stellar photosphere , or at the terminal shocks created by the interaction with the swept up interstellar medium @xcite ,",
    "the collision of supersonic winds produces strong shocks where both electrons and protons can be efficiently accelerated to high energies through first order fermi acceleration @xcite .    in this latter scenario the shock region",
    "is exposed to both , a strong radiation field in the uv range from the participating hot stars , and their magnetic fields .",
    "the detection of synchrotron radiation from such collision regions , implied by the flat or negative spectral indices and brightness temperatures of @xmath9  k , proofs the existence of magnetic fields as well as relativistic electrons in the collision region of some massive binary systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , observations of radio emission reveal an extended region of the synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "in fact , in some binaries ( e.g. , , ) the collision region between the main sequence stars has been resolved in the radio band showing an extended , slightly elongated non - thermal feature on vla and merlin images @xcite in addition to the free - free emission from the spherical wind of the stars .",
    "recently , the extended wind - wind collision region from wr  147 has even been detected in the x - ray band by chandra @xcite .",
    "those electrons with energy @xmath10 will inevitably also be responsible for a non - thermal high energy component at @xmath11 produced through inverse compton scattering of the dense stellar radiation field with characteristic energy @xmath12 .",
    "interestingly , recent xmm and simultanous vla observations of the wr - star 9  sgr might already lurk the hint of a non - thermal x - ray component . while the hard x - ray component of 9  sgr could be equally well fitted by either a hot multi - temperature thermal model with @xmath13  kev , or a steep power - law with power - law index @xmath14 , suggesting a compression ratio @xmath15 , the vla spectrum at the time of the xmm - observations was clearly non - thermal , thus indicating a similar compression ratio @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the relativistic electrons will also loose some fraction of their energy due to non - thermal bremsstrahlung in the field of ions that are embedded in the stellar winds .",
    "it has been estimated , however , that the resulting non - thermal bremsstrahlung component in the @xmath0-ray domain at @xmath17 from electrons of energy @xmath10 will be a minor contribution to the overall emission because of the ambient gas densities involved @xcite .",
    "if electron acceleration is also accompagnied with acceleration of protons out of the thermal pool of wind material , then proton interactions with the ambient ions will produce @xmath0-rays through the hadronic neutral pion decay channel @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "additionally , radiation from the secondary pairs , generated through the decay of charged mesons that are produced by the hadronic @xmath20-collisions , is expected to contribute also to the overall broad band spectrum .",
    "the @xmath1-decay radiative channel has already been considered in the past in the context of winds from massive stars ( @xcite ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the case of single o - stars ) , however , no propagation effects inside the extended collision region nor competing loss mechanisms ( such as expansion losses in the wind ) has been taken into account here .",
    "the goal of this work is to extend the model of non - thermal emission in the high - energy domain from the colliding wind region of binary systems of massive stars to include all relevant energy losses and simultanously also consider the propagation effects that affect a relativistic particle distibution in such an environment . after a brief discription of the geometrical model considered in this work ( sect .",
    "2 ) , we evaluate the evolution of both , proton and primary electron spectra , on the basis of a simplified diffusion - loss equation . in sect .  3 we calculate the expected photon emission due to the inverse compton process ( for the first time including klein - nishina and anisotropy effects ) , relativistic bremsstrahlung and the @xmath0-rays from the decay of @xmath1 that is produced in hadronic proton - proton collisions .",
    "the total expected gamma - ray spectrum is corrected for photon absorption in the uv radiation field of the massive stars .",
    "we apply our model to the famous long - period binary system wr  140 and the above mentioned wr  147 in sect.4 .",
    "our conclusions summarize our results and provide an outlook on the detectability of colliding wind binary systems with upcoming instruments like glast , and contemporary imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) .",
    "the typical radial velocity profile @xmath21 of winds from hot massive stars obeys the relation @xmath22 @xcite with @xmath23 , @xmath24 the radius of the star and @xmath25 the terminal velocity .",
    "recent observations indicate the existence of clumping in the wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for our schematic picture here we shall postpone the effects of clumping to later work and will consider a homogeneous uniform wind .",
    "we also neglect any small - scale shocks within the wind .",
    "the winds from binary systems flow nearly radially until they collide to form a discontinuity at the location of ram pressure balance , and forward and reverse shocks . in the shock region",
    "the gas is heated to temperatures of @xmath26  k @xcite which causes strong thermal x - ray emission . behind the shock the gas expands sideways from the wind collision region along the contact surface out to larger @xmath27 .",
    "it is therefore suggestive to distinguish two regions of the extended emission site ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : in the acceleration zone @xmath28 ( first - order ) diffusive acceleration provides high - energy particles out of a thermal pool . while the stellar winds prohibit the escape of energetic particles on the upstream side of the shocks , we anticipate that in the downstream region spatial diffusion is more efficient than convective / advective motion ( which we call `` convection '' in the following ) in transporting particles to the boundary of the acceleration zone at @xmath29 .",
    "subsequent to their diffusive escape from the acceleration zone , the energetic particles enter the convection dominated zone @xmath30 .",
    "the characteristic radius @xmath29 is defined by equality of the convection time scale @xmath31 and the diffusion time scale @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , we demand that the distance of the emission region from the low - momentum - wind source is large compared to the longitudinal extension of the emission region .",
    "while in reality the form of the contact surface is bent towards the star that shows the lower wind momentum , observed as arcs of emission on radio images ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider here the simplified geometry of a cylinder disk ( see fig .",
    "[ schema ] ) . this may be justified by the rapid particle energy loss rates that do not allow the transport of energetic particles to large distances from their acceleration site . in other words ,",
    "most particle energy losses are expected to appear close to the acceleration zone where a cylinder geometry appears a reasonable approximation .",
    "the thickness @xmath33 of the cylinder - like emission region is governed by the velocity of the hitting winds .",
    "we shall further neglect here the interaction of the stellar radiation fields on the wind structure @xcite which is justified for long - period binaries .    in the case of a collision between the spherical wind of a primary ( e.g. a wr - star ) and a secondary companion ( e.g. a ob - star ) which has reached their terminal velocities ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) ,",
    "the location of the shock is determined by the balance of the ram pressure of both winds @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the densities of the gas ahead of and near the shock of the stellar winds of the ob- and wr - stars . in this case",
    "the distance of the shock front from the wr - star , @xmath39 , and from the ob - star , @xmath40 , is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the separation of the binaries and @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the mass loss rates of the wr- and ob - star , respectively . since @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the shock location is rather close to the ob - star , i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "this appears to be in excellent agreement with the observed locations of the collision region in the radio domain of e.g. @xcite , and this also implies that the shocked gas of the winds of both the ob- and the wr - star have a comparable mass density .",
    "if the wind collision occurs at a distance smaller than the alfvn radius @xmath49 @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the star s surface magnetic field ) from the ob - star , significant deceleration of the wr - wind in the ob - radiation field is expected @xcite . in this case , the colliding winds do not reach their terminal velocities . typically , @xmath53 leading to @xmath54 for ob - stars @xcite .",
    "for the present work we limit ourselves to situations , where the binary winds reach their terminal velocities at the shock location .    the external magnetic field @xmath55 of a star changes in an outflow from the classical dipol field @xmath56 to a radially dominated one at the alfvn radius @xmath57 and finally to a toroidally dominated one for @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the surface rotation velocity with typical values of order @xmath61 for early type stars @xcite .",
    "we use these equations to determine the magnetic field at the location of the collision front .",
    "this value is held constant throughout the emission zone .",
    "the surface magnetic field of massive stars are not well known .",
    "@xcite report the detection of a 1.1  kg dipolar magnetic field of presumably fossil origin at the surface of the young o star @xmath62 ori  c. @xcite argues for surface magnetic field strengths of order @xmath63  g in wr - stars . on the other hand from the non - detection of the zeeman effect for many o- and b - stars only upper limits of order a few @xmath64  g exist @xcite . for this work",
    "we shall fix the surface magnetic field at a reasonable value of @xmath65  g unless stated otherwise .",
    "the plane of the binary system is inclined by an angle @xmath66 with respect to the observer ( @xmath67 corresponds to an observer in the plane of the stars ) , and @xmath68 , the angle between the projected sight line and the line connecting the stars is a measure of the orbital phase of the system . in the following , periastron passage is defined by the orbital phase @xmath69 , and @xmath70 for the wr - star being in front of the ob - star along the sight line .    in the co - rotating system centered on the ob - star",
    "the location of the emission site is defined in polar coordinates by the azimuthal angle @xmath71 and the polar angle @xmath72 for @xmath73 ( see fig .  1 ) . in the same star - centered frame the line - of - sight to the observer",
    "is described by the angles @xmath74 with @xmath75 , and @xmath76 with @xmath77 .    the radiation yield of inverse compton scattering depends on the angle @xmath78 between the directions of the incoming ( from the ob - star ) and outgoing photons , which obviously depends on the location of the scattering electron as well as the orbital phase .",
    "we find @xmath79    the corresponding azimuthal angle @xmath80 is irrelevant for the scattering process .",
    "we expect two standing shocks and a discontinuity between them . for typical massive stars",
    "the wind velocities are of comparable value and in addition the ram - pressure balance ( eq .  [ 1 ] ) ensures a similar upstream gas density for both the ob- and the wr - wind shocks .",
    "it thus appears justified as assume the two shocks as well as the corresponding acceleration and escape rates to be identical .",
    "as motivated above we distinguish two zones of the extended emission region . in the acceleration zone",
    "suprathermal particles of energy @xmath81 from the stellar winds are energized through diffusive shock acceleration at a rate @xmath82 where @xmath83 @xcite with @xmath84 is the upstream velocity of the standing shock , @xmath85 the compression ratio and @xmath86 the ( assumed ) energy - independent diffusion coefficient perpendicular to the wind contact surface . in this region diffusion",
    "dominates over the convective flow along the wind contact surface .",
    "the acceleration region can in good approximation be treated as a leaky box with a free escape boundary at @xmath87 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "introducing an energy - independent escape time @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the diffusion coefficient along the wind contact surface , the continuity equation for this zone then reads : @xmath90 where @xmath91 includes energy gain through diffusive acceleration as well as continuous energy losses .",
    "the solution @xmath92 consists of a power law that is modified at the high - energy end of the spectrum : @xmath93 where @xmath94 depends on the radiative energy losses employed , and @xmath95 where energy losses are negligible .",
    "adjacent to the acceleration zone is the so - called convective zone , where convection along the wind contact surface is a faster transport process than is diffusion . for the convective flow",
    "we assume for simplicity a constant velocity , @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",

    "we considered first order fermi acceleration out of a pool of thermal particles , and took into account radiative losses ( synchrotron , inverse compton including klein - nishina effects , bremsstrahlung and coulomb losses ) , ( energy - independent ) diffusion by introducing a constant escape time @xmath164 and convection / advection with constant speed . above a certain distance from the stagnation point",
    "convection dominates over diffusion with the transition point determined by balancing the diffusion and convection loss time .",
    "correspondingly , we devided the emission region into a region where acceleration / diffusion dominates , the  acceleration zone  , and the outer region where convection / advection dominates , the  convection zone ",
    ".    electrons may reach relativistic energies , once they overcome the heavy coulomb losses in the dense shocked material , through diffusive shock acceleration up to the bohm diffusion limit . for wide binary systems",
    "this latter constraint is often severe , while for close binaries , radiative losses mostly cause the cutoff . taking into account existing upper limits of the stellar surface magnetic field strength of massive stars , inverse compton losses in general",
    "dominate over synchrotron losses if in the thomson loss regime .",
    "we have shown , however , that losses may well extend into the transition region leading to the extreme klein - nishina regime .",
    "the flattening of the compton loss rate there may in some cases cause the synchrotron losses dominate eventually . _",
    "thus a rigorous treatment of the compton losses must include klein - nishina effects .",
    "_ for this purpose we have derived analytical approximations for klein - nishina losses that are suitable for massive binary systems , and allow at the same time to solve the relevant diffusion - loss equation analytically . despite the high density environment of the emitting collision region , non - thermal bremsstrahlung losses prove general to be of minor importance .",
    "this turns out to be true also for the corresponding radiation .",
    "we have studied inverse compton radiation , the main emission channel for relativistic electrons in these systems , in severe detail .",
    "the use of the full klein - nishina cross section leads to a spectral softening at the high - energy end of the emitted radiation .",
    "since the stellar target photons for inverse compton scattering arrive at the collision region from a prefered direction , the full angular dependence of the scattering process has to be considered .",
    "its anisotropic nature leads to variations of the flux level by up to several orders of magnitude ( depending on system inclination and eccentricity ) as well as cutoff energy with orbital phase . the maximum flux and",
    "cutoff energy occurs when the wr - star lies behind the ob - star .",
    "we consider therefore massive binary systems as @xmath0-ray sources that are variable on the time scale of their orbital period even in the absence of a strong system eccentricity .",
    "the inclusion of convection / advection effects into the calculation of the particle spectra reveals a possibly visible spectral feature , too .",
    "because of a deficit of low - energy particles in the convection zone , a softening of the volume - integrated radiation spectrum may occur if the convection zone is sufficiently large compared to the acceleration zone",
    ". a detection of this feature would give valuable information about the particle propagation properties in the emission region .",
    "since thermal protons are most likely wind constituents as well , diffusive shock acceleration implies the presence of relativistic protons in the wind collision region .",
    "if they reach energies of several gev , their presence may show up as @xmath1-decay @xmath0-rays produced through inelastic proton - proton collisions .",
    "their detectability , however , depends not only on the relativistic electron - to - proton ratio and the instrument capabilities , but also on the importance of the competing radiation mechanisms .",
    "e.g. in the case of wr  140 close to periastron , the otherwise dominating inverse compton radiation most likely cease to reach sufficient high energies that would allow mev - gev emission , which increases the chance of detecting @xmath1-decay @xmath0-rays .    finally , we find that photon - photon pair production can not be neglected if the produced radiation exceeds energies of @xmath358 tev , which lies typically at 50 - 100 gev .",
    "the absorption optical depth thereby depends sensitively on orbital phase and system inclination .",
    "although many free parameters are involved in the presented model for high energy emission from the wind collision region of massive binaries , few are those which are unrelated to observations , and even fewer those which  if changing",
    " may have a significant impact on the predicted @xmath0-ray intensity . indeed , since ic emission seems the dominant emission process at high energies in most cases , the high energy output can directly be deduced from the knowledge of the synchrotron emission . while the non - thermal radio flux level provides information on",
    "the required injected energy in form of electrons if the magnetic field is known , its radio spectrum constrains acceleration and propagation parameters .",
    "equipartition arguments together with lower magnetic field limits from the razin - tsytovich effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and observational limits on the stellar surface magnetic field in connection with a plausible dipole field configuration can be used to estimate the magnetic field strength in the collision region . the fact that relativistic electrons exist , supplies a lower limit on the acceleration rate , while an upper limit is given by the bohm diffusion regime for the likely case of diffusive shock acceleration operating in these objects .",
    "we applied our model to two archetypical wr - systems : wr  140 is arguable the most popular among these sources .",
    "we predict wr  140 to be detectable with glast and magic , except at phases close to periastron due to an early cutoff of the electron spetrum already at @xmath252  mev .",
    "this may lead to the dominance of bremsstrahlung and hadronically produced @xmath0-rays above @xmath359mev , at this phase , while at phases far from periastron inverse compton radiation is predicted to dominate at all energies .",
    "orbital flux variations at high energies far from periastron are expected with amplitudes that vary by a factor @xmath216 .",
    "the @xmath314factor 10 wider binary system wr  147 is notable for being the brightest ( because closest ) system at radio frequencies , and for being one of the few systems where the thermal and non - thermal radio emission are observed to arise from spatially different resolved regions . due to a lack of knowledge of the system parameters we model wr  147 face - on with no significant eccentricity .",
    "the low target photon density at the collision location makes photon absorption negligible here , and at the same time allows the electron spectrum to extend up to sub - tev - energies if the acceleration efficiency is favorable .",
    "this would lead to radiation up to the 100 gev - region on a flux level possibly detectable even with veritas at some orbital phases , while glast has good chances to trace this system at all phases .",
    "integral s sensitivity at @xmath0-ray energies will most likely be insufficient to discover these sources as @xmath0-ray emitter given the finite amount of observation time in individual instrumental pointings .    in this work we concentrated on the emission from a steady - state particle spectrum .",
    "being time - dependent systems in general , a time - dependent diffusion - loss equation shall give a more realistic description of the emitted intensity .",
    "in this case we expect that , similar to supernova remnants , the electron spectrum will slowly be built up with the maximum particle energy increasing with time .",
    "typically the electron spectrum is fully developped after a few tens of hours .",
    "the uncertainty of a given phase corresponding to the here calculated steady - state emission therefore lies typically in this time range .",
    "a more comprehensive discussion of the behaviour of massive colliding wind systems in the framework of a time - dependent diffusion - loss equation will be considered in a forthcoming paper .    in conclusion , we consider colliding wind regions of massive binary systems that are wide enough to avoid radiative braking , as promising sources of high energy emission that may extend far beyond the x - ray band .",
    "high energy observations of these systems by sensitive , low - threshold iacts and satellite instruments can be used not only to derive geometrical details but also to explore the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration at densities much higher than in other astronomical objects with high mach number shocks , e.g. supernovae .",
