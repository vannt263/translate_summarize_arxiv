    "the combined analysis of all solar neutrino experiments @xcite gives firm evidence for neutrino oscillations .",
    "all data are well described using just two neutrino mass eigenstates and imply a mass squared difference between @xmath6ev@xmath2 and @xmath7ev@xmath2 and a mixing angle between @xmath8 and @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this region of parameter space is referred to as the large mixing angle solution ( lma ) .",
    "the rate and spectrum of reactor anti - neutrino interactions in the kamland experiment  @xcite are also well reproduced for these mixing angles and some of these @xmath10 . over the @xmath10 range of the lma ,",
    "solar @xmath11b neutrinos are @xmath12100% resonantly converted into the second mass eigenstate by the large matter density inside the sun  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the survival probability into @xmath13 is @xmath14 .",
    "however , due to the presence of the earth s matter density , the oscillation probability at an experimental site on earth into @xmath13 differs from @xmath15 during the night .",
    "since super - kamiokande experiment is primarily sensitive to @xmath13 s , this induces an apparent dependence of the measured neutrino interaction rate on the solar zenith angle ( often a regeneration of @xmath13 s during the night ) .",
    "recently , super - kamiokande employed a maximum likelihood fit to the expected solar zenith angle dependence on the neutrino interaction rate  @xcite .",
    "herein , the statistical uncertainty was reduced by 25% compared to previous measurement of the day / night asymmetry  @xcite which consists of two flux measurements in two separate data samples ( day and night ) .",
    "it would require almost three more years of running time to obtain a similar uncertainty reduction . also the gno , sage , and sno collaborations  @xcite reported updated neutrino interaction rates .",
    "super - kamiokande ( sk ) is a 50,000 ton water cherenkov detector described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "sk measures the energy , direction , and time of the recoil electron from elastic scattering of solar neutrinos with electrons by detection of the emitted cherenkov light .",
    "super - kamiokande started taking data in april , 1996 . in this report , the full sk - i low energy data set consisting of 1496 live days ( may @xmath16 , 1996 through july @xmath17 , 2001 )",
    "is used .",
    "is @xmath18ev@xmath2 .",
    "the gray band is the @xmath19 sk measurement .",
    "the hatched area corresponds to the @xmath19 uncertainty of the @xmath11b flux by junghans et al  @xcite .",
    "the solid black line shows the oscillation prediction of the day / night asymmetry.,width=288 ]",
    "the solar zenith angle @xmath20 between the solar direction and the vertical direction defines the path length of the solar neutrino inside the earth . during the day ( @xmath21 ) this path length is zero , during the night ( @xmath22 ) it varies between zero and ( up to ) the diameter of the earth .",
    "the day / night rate asymmetry is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) refers to the average neutrino interaction rate during the day ( night ) .",
    "if the neutrino interaction rate during the night varies significantly from the average night rate @xmath25 , and if the functional form ( shape ) of this variation is known , the amplitude of this time variation of the rate can be determined more accurately then just calculating @xmath26 from the average rates .",
    "these conditions are met for two - neutrino oscillations in the lma region . in",
    "@xcite a maximum likelihood fit to the sk data finds a day / night amplitude equivalent to @xmath27(stat)@xmath4(syst)% . the fit assumes @xmath28ev@xmath2 and @xmath29 .",
    "the asymmetry calculated from the measured average day and night rates on the other hand is @xmath30(stat)@xmath4(syst)%  @xcite .",
    "it assumes a step function for the time variation and therefore does not reflect any oscillation parameters .",
    "the dependence of the fitted day / night amplitude on the mixing angle @xmath31 is shown in figure  [ fig : dnsin ] . overlaid",
    "are the predicted asymmetries and the solar model constraint of the @xmath11b neutrino flux from junghans et al  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 dependence is stronger as can be seen in figure  [ fig : dndm ] .",
    "overlaid are the predicted asymmetries and bands ( typically called lma-0 , lma - i , lma - ii , etc ) corresponding to the kamland 95% allowed contours : the sk day / night measurement excludes lma-0 , and favors lma - i .    .",
    "the gray band is the @xmath19 sk measurement .",
    "the hatched area corresponds to the 95% allowed contours reported by the kamland collaboration .",
    "the solid black line shows the oscillation prediction of the day / night asymmetry.,width=288 ]",
    "an oscillation analysis of the sk data by itself is found in  @xcite .",
    "it describes the solar zenith angle variation with a likelihood , while the spectrum is fit with a @xmath32 method .",
    "since the combined solar neutrino oscillation analysis of  @xcite was performed , the neutrino interaction rate measurements of several experiments improved in precision . in particular , the sno collaboration reported a more precise neutral - current interaction rate on deuterium employing salt to enhance neutron detection .",
    "figure  [ fig : sol3 ] shows in ( dark gray ) the allowed regions at 95% c.l . resulting from the combination of experimental data from gallex / gno , sage , the homestake experiment and sk .",
    "it relies on the @xmath11b flux from junghans and six low energy neutrino fluxes of the standard solar model  @xcite .",
    "also shown is a combined fit to sk data , the new salt - enhanced sno rate measurements , and the sno day / night asymmetry .",
    "this fit does not rely on any neutrino flux prediction .",
    "both analyses yield a unique allowed region  the lma solution  and agree very closely in mixing .",
    "the sk / sno analysis provides somewhat stronger constraints on @xmath10 . assuming cpt invariance , both fits",
    "are then combined with a binned likelihood analysis  @xcite of the kamland reactor anti - neutrino measurements  @xcite , the results of which are shown in the right panel . in either case , only lma - i remains allowed .",
    "the dark gray areas / solid lines use the solar neutrino data from gallex / gno , sage , homestake & sk the ssm neutrino fluxes ( and the junghans @xmath11b flux constraint ) , the light gray areas / dashed lines ) solar measurements from sk & sno and no neutrino flux constraints from solar models.,width=302 ]    sno has also published a combined oscillation analysis , which uses the sk zenith spectrum @xmath32 instead of the likelihood employed in this report .",
    "figure  [ fig : osc ] compares allowed areas of the combined fit to all data using the sk likelihood ( dark gray areas ) with sno s contours at 95% c.l . and @xmath33 : the @xmath10 constraints get stronger when the sk zenith spectrum is replaced by the sk likelihood .",
    "when combined with kamland , the lma - i is favored over all other solutions by @xmath34 . the @xmath33-allowed lma - ii contour from sno",
    "s analysis disappears , when the sk likelihood is used .",
    "the oscillation @xmath32 is gaussian ; the parameters are determined as @xmath1ev@xmath2 and @xmath0 . at those parameters ,",
    "the day / night asymmetry is expected to be @xmath5 while the amplitude fit to sk data yields @xmath3(stat)@xmath4(syst)% .",
