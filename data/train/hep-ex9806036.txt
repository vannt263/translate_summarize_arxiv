    "bose - einstein correlations ( bec ) between pairs of identical bosons , mainly the @xmath54 system , have been extensively studied in a large variety of interactions and over a wide range of energies @xcite .",
    "these correlations , which are present when the bosons are near to one another in phase space , are used to estimate the size of the emitter of the particles and more recently in qcd - based models to describe fragmentation and hadronisation in high energy reactions @xcite .",
    "the two - pion bec effect has lately also been discussed @xcite in connection with the measurement of the w mass in the reaction @xmath55 at lep2 .    in systems of more than two identical bosons , bec",
    "are also expected to be present .",
    "these higher - order correlations may affect the multi - hadron production and are also of interest in intermittency studies @xcite .",
    "detection of the `` genuine '' multi - boson bec is complicated by the fact that they have to be isolated from the lower - order boson correlations and therefore require large data samples .",
    "in addition , systems of several identical charged bosons , placed nearby in phase space , are subject to a relatively large repulsive coulomb interaction which may suppress the bec effect . as a consequence , only relatively few higher order bec studies of three and more charged pions",
    "have been reported @xcite . in those studies , mainly due to lack of statistics , it was not possible to isolate and verify the genuine multi - boson bec from the lower - order ones .",
    "attempts have been made to infer from the measured bec of the multi - boson systems the individual contribution of each of the higher order correlations by model dependent formulae .",
    "a significant genuine bec signal of three identical charged pions , @xmath56 , has been reported in a hadron - proton interaction experiment @xcite and more recently in a lep experiment @xcite where , however , the coulomb effect was neglected .",
    "here we report on a bec study of the @xmath56 system carried out with a large sample of approximately @xmath0 hadronic @xmath1 decays , recorded by the opal detector at the @xmath57 lep collider during the years 1991 to 1995 . in this analysis , which takes into account the coulomb effect ,",
    "we have isolated the genuine three - pion bec and estimated the size of the emitter . in section 2",
    "we introduce the extension of the two - boson bec to the system of three identical bosons .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the procedure used for the coulomb correction of the three - pion bec and in section 4 the experimental details are given . in section 5",
    "we describe our method for the extraction of the genuine @xmath56 bec and present the results obtained from our analysis .",
    "the relations between the two - pion and the genuine three - pion bec parameters are explored in section 6 .",
    "finally , the summary and conclusions are presented in section 7 .",
    "in describing the three - boson bec we follow the approach which was also adopted , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the bec of pairs of identical bosons can be formally expressed in terms of the normalised function @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the total boson production cross section , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the single - boson density in momentum space and the inclusive cross section , respectively . similarly @xmath62 and @xmath63 are respectively the density of the two - boson system and its inclusive cross section .",
    "the product of the independent one - particle densities @xmath64 is referred to as the reference density distribution , or reference sample , to which the measured correlations are compared .",
    "the inclusive two - boson density @xmath62 can be written as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 represents the two - body correlations . in the simple case of two identical bosons the normalised density function @xmath67 , defined in eq .",
    "[ eq_1 ] , already describes the genuine two - body correlations and has been referred to in previous bec studies of opal @xcite as the @xmath68 correlation function .",
    "thus one has @xmath69 where @xmath70 $ ] is the normalised two - body correlation term . since bose - einstein correlation are present when the bosons are close to one another in phase space , one natural choice is to study them as a function of the variable @xmath71 defined by @xmath72 which approaches zero as the identical bosons move closer in phase space . here",
    "@xmath73 is the four - momentum vector of the @xmath74th particle , @xmath75 is the boson mass and @xmath76 is the invariant mass squared of the two - boson system .    in the parametrisation proposed by goldhaber et al .",
    "@xcite , @xmath68 has the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 estimates the size of the two - boson emitter which is taken to be of gaussian shape .",
    "the strength of the bec effect , frequently referred to as the chaoticity parameter , is measured by @xmath79 which varies in the range @xmath80 .",
    "the inclusive density of three bosons , @xmath81 , includes the three independent boson momentum spectra , the two - particle correlations @xmath82 and the genuine three - particle correlations @xmath83 , namely : @xmath84 where the summation is taken over all the three possible permutations .",
    "the normalised inclusive three - body density , is then given by @xmath85 here @xmath86 represents a mixed three - boson system in which only two of them are correlated , and @xmath87 represents the three - boson correlation . in analogy with @xmath68 , one can define a correlation function @xmath88 , which measures the genuine three - boson correlation , by subtracting from @xmath89 the term which contains the two - boson correlations contribution . thus @xmath90 which depends only on the genuine three - boson correlations . for the study of the three - boson correlations",
    "we use the variable @xmath91 which is defined as @xmath92 where the summation is taken over all the three different @xmath93 boson pairs and @xmath94 is the invariant mass squared of the three - boson system . from the definition of this three - boson variable",
    "it is clear that as @xmath91 approaches zero so do the three @xmath95 values which eventually reach the region where the two - boson bec enhancement is observed .",
    "the genuine three - pion correlation function @xmath96 can be parametrised by the expression @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath4 , which can vary within the limits @xmath98 , measures the strength of the three - boson bec effect and @xmath6 estimates the size of the three - boson emitter .",
    "the factor two which multiplies @xmath4 arises from the presence of two possible diagrams with exchange of all the identical pions within a triplet . to extract from the data values for the strength @xmath4 and the emitter size @xmath6 , we modified eq .",
    "[ eq_c3q ] to read @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a normalisation factor and the linear term @xmath101 accounts for the long range correlations arising from charge and energy conservation and phase space constraints .",
    "higher - order @xmath91 terms for the long range correlations were found not to be needed in the present analysis .",
    "the observed bec of identical charged bosons is suppressed by the coulomb repulsive force . to account for this effect a correction to the measured bec distribution is required .",
    "if @xmath102 is the two - boson correlation in the presence of the coulomb effect then it is related to the true @xmath103 through the function @xmath104 , so that @xmath105 in the case that the reference sample is a monte carlo generated data without the coulomb effect , @xmath104 can be expressed by the gamow factor @xcite : @xmath106 where @xmath107 . here",
    "@xmath108 and @xmath109 are the charges , in positron units , of the two bosons having a mass of @xmath75 , and @xmath110 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "recently alternative coulomb corrections @xcite for the two - boson system have been proposed , which are based on non - gaussian parametrisations .",
    "these could not be extended to the three - pion system and therefore were not used in our analysis .",
    "for a given three charged bosons system , with boson pairs having @xmath71 values of @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the coulomb correction @xmath114 can be approximated , in terms of the @xmath115 function by @xcite : @xmath116 where the average is taken over all experimentally accessible values of @xmath95 which satisfy the condition @xmath117  .",
    "the function @xmath118 can be evaluated through eq .",
    "[ eq_g33 ] or by using a slightly more precise formulation proposed in @xcite . in our analysis",
    "the differences between the results of these two methods were smaller than the statistical errors so that the simpler method was sufficiently accurate for our purposes .",
    "details of the opal detector and its performance at the lep @xmath57 collider are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we will describe briefly only those detector components pertinent to the present analysis , namely the central tracking chambers .    besides a silicon microvertex detector , the central tracking chambers consist of a precision vertex detector , a large jet chamber , and additional @xmath119-chambers surrounding the jet chamber . the vertex detector is a @xmath120 long , two - layer cylindrical drift chamber that surrounds the beam pipe - axis points to the centre of the lep ring , and positive @xmath119 is along the electron beam direction .",
    "the angles @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the polar and azimuthal angles respectively . ] .",
    "the jet chamber has a length of @xmath123 and a diameter of @xmath124 .",
    "it is divided into 24 sectors in @xmath122 , each equipped with 159 sense wires parallel to the beam ensuring a large number of measured points even for particles emerging from a secondary vertex .",
    "the jet chamber also provides a measurement of the specific energy loss , @xmath125 , of charged particles @xcite .",
    "a resolution of @xmath126 on @xmath125 has been obtained , allowing particle identification over a large momentum range .",
    "the @xmath119-chambers , @xmath123 long , @xmath127 wide and @xmath128 thick , allow a precise measurement of the @xmath119-coordinate of the charged tracks .",
    "they cover polar angles in the region @xmath129 and @xmath130 of the azimuthal angular range .",
    "all the chambers are contained in a solenoid providing an axial magnetic field of 0.435 t. the combination of these chambers leads to a momentum resolution of @xmath131 , where @xmath132 in @xmath133 is the transverse momentum with respect to the beam direction .",
    "the first term under the square root sign represents the contribution from multiple coulomb scattering @xcite .",
    "the analysis was performed with the opal data collected at lep with centre of mass energies on and around the @xmath1 peak with the requirement that the jet and @xmath119-chambers were fully operational .",
    "the hadronic @xmath1 decays were selected according to the number of charged tracks and the visible energy of the event @xcite .",
    "we applied the same track quality and @xmath125 cuts described in a former opal bec study of two identical charged pions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , events with a thrust angle of @xmath134 with respect to the beam axis were rejected .",
    "finally we accepted only events with a relative charge balance of @xmath135 , where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are respectively the observed numbers of positively and negatively charged tracks . following these criteria a total of @xmath138 hadronic @xmath1 decay events",
    "were used in the analysis .    to avoid configurations with overlapping tracks",
    ", we rejected pion pairs if their invariant mass was less than @xmath139 and if the opening angle between them in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis was less than @xmath140 . in the present analysis",
    "all charged tracks are assumed to be pions . from monte carlo ( mc ) studies @xcite",
    "we have estimated that the average pion purity of our charged track sample is @xmath141 with a systematic uncertainty of @xmath142 and a negligible statistical error .",
    "thus the pion purity of the three charged track system is @xmath143 .",
    "the bec analysis used the hadronic @xmath1 decay data of opal where in each event all possible @xmath56 combinations were taken as the data sample . for the reference distribution we used a",
    "monte carlo generated sample @xcite of @xmath0 jetset  7.4 events which have passed a full detector simulation @xcite but do not include bec and coulomb effects .",
    "this jetset monte carlo program , which includes most of the known resonances which decay into the @xmath144 and @xmath145 final states , was carefully tuned to the opal data @xcite . here",
    "one should note that the systems of the measured data contain one pair of identical pions and therefore can not be used as a reference sample .",
    "thus : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the number of the @xmath56 data combinations and @xmath148 is the corresponding number of monte carlo @xmath56 combinations at the same @xmath91 value .",
    "the monte carlo sample was normalised to the data in a @xmath91 region far away from any observable bec enhancement .",
    "this was achieved by requiring that the integrated number of the monte carlo entries in the @xmath91 range @xmath149 was equal to that of the data . the measured @xmath150 distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_3p]a in the range of @xmath151 .",
    "the data points below @xmath152 have relatively large errors , and a lower three - track separation efficiency of identical charged tracks .",
    "therefore a lower limit of @xmath152 was imposed on the analysis . in the figure",
    "a clear enhancement is observed in the region below @xmath153 .",
    "this enhancement can be interpreted as coming from both the known two - pion and from the genuine three - pion bec .      to extract the genuine three - pion bec one has to subtract from @xmath150 the contribution coming from the well known two - pion bec . in our analysis",
    "this last contribution is evaluated from the mixed - charged @xmath154 combinations of the data . to this end , it is convenient to rewrite @xmath150 as follows : @xmath155 the total excess @xmath156 above the monte carlo expectation has two contributions .",
    "the first from the two - pion bec , @xmath157 , and the second from the genuine three - pion bec , @xmath158 , so that : @xmath159 from this it follows that what should be subtracted from @xmath150 to obtain the genuine three - pion bec , is : @xmath160 because we utilise for the subtraction the same events used for the @xmath150 measurement , there exists in every event with given charged multiplicity @xmath161 and charge balance @xmath162 values a relation between @xmath157 and @xmath163 . here",
    "@xmath164 is the number of @xmath154 combinations in the data and @xmath165 is the corresponding number of combinations for the mc generated sample properly normalised to the data in the @xmath91 range of @xmath166 .",
    "if we define @xmath167 as the number of @xmath154 combinations in a given event , then it can be related to @xmath168 , the number of @xmath56 combinations .",
    "a straightforward combinatorial calculation yields that for an event with given @xmath161 and @xmath169 values , one has : @xmath170 in our analysis we utilise , after the application of the appropriate cuts , all the hadronic @xmath1 decays lying within a wide range of multiplicity and charge balance .",
    "if we define @xmath171 as the ratio @xmath172 averaged over all multiplicity and charge balance values in our data , then : @xmath173 the integrations are carried out over the @xmath91 region where @xmath157 and @xmath174 are different from zero .",
    "we further verified from mc studies that , to a good approximation , relation ( [ eq_delpppi ] ) holds also in its differential form , that is : @xmath175    the average @xmath171 depends on the multiplicity @xmath161 and the charge balance @xmath169 distributions of the data sample . using the mc hadronic @xmath1 decay sample we determined , by counting the number of combinations in the @xmath91 range of @xmath149 , that @xmath176 with a negligible statistical error .",
    "the same value is obtained when the mc sample is replaced by the data sample .",
    "this value shifts to @xmath177 when the @xmath91 range is enlarged to @xmath178 .",
    "we also studied the variation of this ratio on the pion purity .",
    "to this end we evaluated this ratio from the mc sample using only tracks which were generated as pions with the result that @xmath179 .",
    "the effect of the shift from 3.69 to 3.71 on the bec parameters was found to be negligible in comparison to the statistical errors and to other systematic uncertainties ( see table [ tab_sys ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_del ] we show the @xmath156 and the @xmath180 distributions as a function of @xmath91 .",
    "as can be seen , the two distributions are similar in the higher @xmath91 region , namely between @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the slight difference between the two distributions can be attributed to the systematic uncertainties given in table [ tab_sys ] , in particular those listed as items ( f ) and ( g ) .",
    "thus in this @xmath91 range the excess of @xmath56 combinations is fully accounted for by the excess seen in the @xmath154 due to the two - pion bec . in the lower @xmath91 region",
    "an excess of @xmath156 over @xmath183 is observed which can no longer be attributed to the two - pion bec and is therefore identified as the genuine three - pion bec contribution , @xmath158 .",

    "<S> bose - einstein correlations ( bec ) of three identical charged pions were studied in @xmath0 hadronic @xmath1 decays recorded with the opal detector at lep . </S>",
    "<S> the genuine three - pion correlations , corrected for the coulomb effect , were separated from the known two - pion correlations by a new subtraction procedure . a significant genuine three - pion bec enhancement near threshold was observed having an emitter source radius of @xmath2 and a strength of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb correction was found to increase the @xmath4 value by @xmath5 and to reduce @xmath6 by @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath4 corresponds to a value of @xmath8 when one takes into account the three - pion sample purity . </S>",
