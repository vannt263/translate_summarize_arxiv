    "it is well established that mg0.1emii  @xmath7 absorption , detected in background quasar / galaxy spectra , arises from gas associated with foreground galaxies and thus provides a unique means to directly observe mechanisms by which galaxies acquire , chemically enrich , expel , and recycle their gaseous component ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the ion is ideal since it traces metal - enriched low - ionization gas with @xmath8   @xcite and , as a result , is detected out to projected galactic radii of @xmath9 kpc @xcite .",
    "a significant quantity of gas is probed by absorption in galaxy halos with roughly 15% of the gas residing in dlas and 5% of the total hydrogen in stars @xcite .",
    "a large body of evidence suggests that absorption traces both outflows from star - forming galaxies @xcite and accretion onto host galaxies @xcite .",
    "while it is clear both processes are occurring , it is difficult to disentangle which absorption systems may be uniquely associated with either process . since outflows are presumably metal - enriched , whereas accreting material should be metal - poor , comparing the absorption - line and host galaxy metallicity provides one suitable test for discriminating winds from accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however it is not yet feasible to perform this experiment for a large sample of galaxies .",
    "the spatial distribution relative to their host galaxies also provides a promising test .",
    "outflows are expected to extend along the galaxy minor axis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas accretion would progress along filaments more planer to the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "modeling the morphologies of 40 _ hst _ imaged absorbers , @xcite found that the rest - frame  @xmath10 equivalent width , @xmath3 , is dependent on galaxy inclination , suggesting a co - planer geometry .",
    "furthermore , the kinematics are consistent with being coupled to the galaxy angular momentum @xcite .",
    "these results provide evidence that some absorbing gas is accreting co - planer to galaxies .",
    "stacking @xmath11 background galaxy spectra , @xcite showed that , statistically , unresolved -doublet equivalent widths are larger along the galaxy projected minor axis than along the projected major axis within @xmath12@xmath13  kpc , suggesting that the strongest absorption is ejected within winds along the minor axis . using 10 absorbers , @xcite showed that absorption arises along the projected minor and major axes of the host galaxies , suggesting that is primarily detected in outflows and accretion , however , the inclusion of a control sample of non - absorbers is necessary to validate the bimodal claim .",
    "both works were further validated by @xcite who , using 65 galaxies , found that absorption arises preferentially along the galaxy major axis and then along the galaxy minor axis as @xmath3 increases ; they also found that for @xmath1   , the galaxy inclinations and azimuthal angles with respect to the quasar sight - line are consistent with random distributions .    in view of these results , we aim to further explore the azimuthal distribution of absorption for a large sample of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we compute the mean azimuthal angle probability distribution function for galaxies hosting @xmath0   absorption and show that it is bimodal , peaking near the galaxy minor and major axes .",
    "we also show that the distribution is flat for galaxies with @xmath1   ( i.e. , non - absorbers ) .",
    "we further study this distribution in terms of galaxy colors and equivalent widths .",
    "we adopt a @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 cosmology .",

    "the galaxies were selected to be isolated ; group and double galaxies are not included .",
    "the @xmath21   cut maximizes the number of absorbers , while retaining a significant number of non - absorbers .",
    "galaxy ab magnitudes and colors were determined following the methods of @xcite .",
    "rest - frame @xmath22 or @xmath23 were determined from the measured apparent magnitudes . when only one color was measured , we applied a conversion determined from a linear least - squares fit to the average colors from galaxy spectral energy distribution templates of @xcite .",
    "we obtained rest - frame colors for all but one galaxy .    for this work",
    ", all galaxy morphological properties were obtained using gim2d @xcite .",
    "56 galaxies were imaged with _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 , for which we adopt the morphologies and orientations measured by @xcite and @xcite . for the @xcite galaxies imaged with sdss , we adopt the gim2d morphologies and orientations measured by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the sdss galaxies taken from @xcite have a median redshift of @xmath24 .",
    "given the short sdss image exposure times and the high redshifts , we studied the reliability of the gim2d models .",
    "we identified 13 sdss galaxies that had also been imaged with _",
    "hst _ from our previous work ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "all sdss galaxies in our sample are resolved with @xmath2620 pixels at @xmath27 above the background in the @xmath28-band . using the sdss @xmath28-band images",
    ", we computed azimuthal angles using gim2d and then also from the @xmath27 isophotes using source extractor @xcite . in order to minimize the number of gim2d free parameters , we fitted the data using an exponential disk only , with zero bulge contribution .",
    "we found that both the gim2d and isophotal azimuthal angles of the sdss galaxies are consistent with the gim2d azimuthal angles of the _ hst _ galaxies ( within @xmath29 uncertainties of the _ hst _ values ) .",
    "in general , the errors on the gim2d sdss values are a factor of a few larger , whereas it is difficult to quantify uncertainties for the isophotal values .",
    "thus , we modeled the sdss @xmath28-band imaged galaxies as an exponential disk with gim2d , applying the modeling prescription of @xcite .",
    "we modeled all galaxy morphological types since 86% of early - types have regular stellar rotation ( 14% exhibit slow rotation ) , spanning the full range of apparent ellipticities , with 90% being kinematically and photometrically aligned ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt the convention of the azimuthal angle @xmath30 to be along the galaxy major axis and @xmath31 to be along the galaxy minor axis .",
    "direct binning of the azimuthal angles , the approach taken by @xcite , applies only when the measured uncertainties are smaller than the bin size .",
    "further complications arise when the uncertainties are asymmetric , as is the case for gim2d model parameters . here",
    "we take a different approach : we represent the measured azimuthal angles and their uncertainties as univariate asymmetric gaussians ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus creating an azimuthal angle probability distribution function ( pdf ) for each galaxy . from the continuous azimuthal pdfs , we then compute the mean pdf as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "the mean pdf represents the probability of detecting absorption at a given @xmath32 .",
    "this technique provides higher weight per azimuthal angle bin for galaxies with well determined @xmath32 .",
    "however , even the less robustly modeled galaxies provide useful information ; the method is equivalent to stacking low signal - to - noise spectra or images to search for a coherent signal .",
    "-0.25 in   confidence intervals based upon a jackknife analysis in which 10% of the sub - sample was removed at random .",
    "given galaxies exist in multiple bins , the size of the @xmath33 confidence intervals does not simply scale as the square - root of the number of galaxies per bin . however , the sizes of the confidence intervals will increase if more galaxies are removed in the jackknife analysis .",
    "the non - absorbers are consistent with a random distribution within the expected poisson noise .",
    "the bimodal distribution suggests a preference for absorbing gas toward the galaxy major axis ( @xmath30 ) and along the minor axis ( @xmath31 ) .",

    "note the higher covering fractions along the major and minor axes.,title=\"fig : \" ]    -0.05 in",
    "in figure  [ fig : main ] , we present the binned mean azimuthal angle pdf for the 88 absorbing and 35 non - absorbing galaxies .",
    "the binned pdfs have been normalized to the total number of galaxies in each sub - sample .",
    "the shaded regions about each bin are the @xmath29 deviations produced by a jackknife analysis in which we randomly removed 10% of the sample for a million permutations .    the non - absorbers exhibit a relatively flat distribution , as expected for random @xmath32 , and the fluctuations are consistent with poisson noise .",
    "this result confirms the work of @xcite , who showed that the azimuthal angle distribution is random for @xmath1   .    the absorbing galaxies exhibit a bimodal @xmath32 distribution , with",
    "one peak corresponding to the background quasars probing the galaxy projected major axis and a second , higher and broader peak , when the galaxy is probed along the projected minor axis .",
    "the shape of the mean pdf indicates that absorbing gas is preferentially located along the projected major and minor axes of galaxies .",
    "our result confirms the innovatory work of @xcite based upon 10 galaxies .",
    "a plausible scenario is that wind / outflow gas is distributed about the galaxy minor axis with relatively high frequency , whereas accreting / infalling gas is frequently found in a co - planer geometry . for the remainder of the discussion",
    ", we refer to major axis absorption as infalling or accreting gas and to the minor axis absorption as outflowing or wind gas .",
    "we further divided our sample of absorbing galaxies into two impact parameter sub - samples , those with @xmath34 kpc and @xmath35 kpc , and found that the bimodal shape of the mean pdf is well preserved for both impact parameter sub - samples .",
    "this implies that outflowing and accreting gas maintain their major and minor axis orientation preferences , respectively , far out into the halo .",
    "the width of each peak in the mean pdf provides rough constraints on the geometry of outflowing and inflowing gas .",
    "the peak at @xmath30 suggests that accreting gas is found within @xmath36 of the galaxy plane . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the peak is initially narrow , suggesting the majority of galaxies expel gas within @xmath37 of their minor axis .",
    "the much broader tail of the @xmath31 peak suggests that the opening angle of outflowing gas may be as large as @xmath38 , but also the frequency at which this gas is detected decreases for larger opening angles .",
    "our estimated outflow opening angle is consistent with other published values determined using different techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio of the area between the outflowing and infalling gas , bifurcated at @xmath5 , suggests that @xmath39% of absorbing gas is outflowing .    in figure",
    "[ fig : main ] , we plot the gas covering fraction , which is the ratio of the number of absorbers to the sum of absorbers and non - absorbers in each azimuthal bin . this first presentation of the covering fraction as a function of azimuthal angle shows a peak at 0.80.9 along the projected minor axis , a decrease of 2030% at intermediate @xmath32 , and an increase again toward the projected major axis .",
    "the mean covering fraction of our sample , 72% , is consistent with previous results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the color selection adopted from @xcite of @xmath40 represents late - type galaxies ( dashed blue line ) and @xmath41 represents early - type galaxies ( dotted red line ) .",
    "shaded regions are @xmath33 confidence intervals based upon a jackknife analysis . the data are consistent with star - forming galaxies being dominated by outflows .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    -0.05 in    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      we separated the sample of absorbers into early - type and late - type galaxies based on their rest - frame @xmath23 colors .",
    "following @xcite , we adopted the color cut @xmath40 to represent late - type ( blue ) galaxies and @xmath41 to represent early - type ( red ) galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : colors ] , we present the mean azimuthal angle pdf broken down by galaxy color . the early - type galaxies exhibit a relatively flat distribution with @xmath42 fluctuations across bins . however , the elevated frequency at @xmath30 is suggestive that gas is accreted along the major axis , which may provide the cool gas reservoirs observed around early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the late - type galaxies clearly dominate the overall bimodal distribution .",
    "this result is intuitive if we speculate that red galaxies have significantly less accreting gas , and therefore little fuel for star formation , resulting in no outflowing gas . for blue galaxies , the accretion is higher , providing fuel for star formation that then produces outflows .",
    "we also split the absorber sample by galaxy color to yield equal numbers of red and blue galaxies in each sub - sample ; the same trend appears .",
    "the azimuthal bimodality of blue galaxies and the flat distribution of red galaxies is consistent with the picture in which blue star - forming galaxies exhibit outflows due to accreted gas fueling star formation .",
    "one might argue that red galaxies may have a preference for weaker absorption ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we thus investigated whether the @xmath3 distribution depends on galaxy color and @xmath43 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ew ] , we show the area - normalized distribution of @xmath3 for red galaxies and for blue galaxies with @xmath35 kpc and @xmath34 kpc ( we have too few red galaxies to separate them into impact parameter bins ) .",
    "the blue galaxies at smaller @xmath43 have a higher optimally weighted mean @xmath3 than blue galaxies at larger @xmath43 .",
    "this is consistent with the well - known anti - correlation between equivalent width and impact parameter ( cf .",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the sub - sample of red galaxies has a mean @xmath3 consistent with the blue galaxies at larger @xmath43 .",
    "interestingly , figure  [ fig : ew ] shows a paucity of @xmath44   absorption at smaller @xmath43 for blue galaxies compared to both blue galaxies at larger @xmath43 and to all red galaxies .",
    "also , note the paucity of @xmath45   absorption at larger @xmath43 for blue galaxies as compared to both blue galaxies at smaller @xmath43 and to all red galaxies .",
    "however , a ks test yields that the @xmath3 distribution of blue galaxies at smaller @xmath43 are statistically consistent with the @xmath3 distributions of both the red galaxies and the blue galaxies at larger @xmath43 ( 2.0  @xmath46 , a high significance level is difficult to achieve with small number statistics ) .",
    "the suggested weaker absorption associated with red galaxies and with blue galaxies at larger @xmath43 in our sample is consistent with the findings of @xcite , who interpret this as winds extending out to projected distances of @xmath12@xmath13  kpc .",
    "however , the bimodality in the azimuthal distribution is present for our @xmath34  kpc absorber sample , suggesting winds persist beyond @xmath47  kpc , but with smaller @xmath3 indicating that the wind gas thins out at larger @xmath43 .",
    "we further investigated whether the distribution of @xmath3 differs for infalling gas or outflowing gas by splitting the @xmath35  kpc and @xmath34  kpc absorbers into the two azimuthal bins , @xmath48 for inflowing gas and @xmath49 for outflowing gas .",
    "the value @xmath50 is the point of inflection in the mean azimuthal angle pdf . in figure",
    "[ fig : ew ] , we present the area - normalized @xmath3 distributions .",
    "for @xmath49 , the mean @xmath3 differ by a factor of 3.3 for the smaller and larger @xmath43 sub - samples .",
    "similarly , for @xmath48 , the mean @xmath3 differ by a factor of 3.8 for the smaller and larger @xmath43 sub - samples . the @xmath3 distribution for outflowing gas at smaller @xmath43 is characterized by a paucity of @xmath44   absorption and a higher abundance of @xmath45   absorption , whereas the @xmath3 distribution for outflowing gas at larger @xmath43 is characterized by an abundance of @xmath44   absorption and a paucity of @xmath45   absorption . a ks test yields that the populations differ at the @xmath51 significance level .",
    "comparing the @xmath35 kpc @xmath3 distributions for wind versus accreting gas , we note a similar trend ; at smaller impact parameters , accreting gas exhibits a higher abundance of @xmath44   absorption and a paucity of @xmath45   absorption .",
    "ks tests yield that the outflowing gas with @xmath49 and @xmath35  kpc differs from the inflowing gas with @xmath48 and @xmath34  kpc at the @xmath52 significance level .",
    "qualitatively , these combined results may imply that either there is less column density and/or velocity spread of gas in projection along the galaxy major axis than along the minor axis , _ and/or _ , the gas may be more metal - enriched along the galaxy minor axis than along the galaxy major axis .",
    "these trends would be expected for the accretion / wind scenario we have described .",
    "we have demonstrated that the distribution of absorption around galaxies exhibits an azimuthal angle bimodality when compared to non - absorbing galaxies , whereby absorption is preferred near the projected major and minor axes .",
    "outflows and accretion likely extend beyond 40  kpc , but with smaller mean @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the blue star - forming galaxies drive the bimodality , suggesting that the accretion of gas drives star - formation that produce outflows .",
    "red galaxies may exhibit some gas accretion along the major axis . under these assumptions , we compute opening angles of outflows and inflows to be @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .    in addition , the data suggest that star - forming galaxies at low impact parameters exhibit higher mean @xmath3 than red galaxies and star - forming galaxies with larger impact parameters .",
    "also , the @xmath3 distribution for the infalling gas along the major axis exhibits a smaller mean @xmath3 than outflowing gas along the minor axis .",
    "this could result from less gas being probed along the major axis than the minor axis , less velocity structures / dispersions expected for winds , or higher metal enrichment along the minor axis , as expected for wind driven material .",
    "the probability of detecting outflows is @xmath660% , implying that winds are more commonly observed , likely because the opening angle of outflows is 2.5 times larger than for accreting gas .",
    "the data paint a picture that is consistent with the general idea of how the buildup and evolution of galaxies occurs as well as how galaxies enrich their gaseous halos .",
    "our results signify that additional _ hst _ imaging of absorbing and non - absorbing galaxies will substantially increase our understanding of galactic scale feedback and accretion of intergalactic gas .",
