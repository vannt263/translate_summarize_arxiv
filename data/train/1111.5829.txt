    "the magnetic field is calibrated by performing spin flips between  and  as described above , recording the rf resonance frequency at different currents applied through the coils .",
    "because the coils are not in a geometrically ideal helmholtz configuration , the field creates an anti - trapping potential for  and a trapping potential for , with a curvature of about 0.1  g/@xmath72 for a field of 1  g. this curvature primarily affects the axial trap frequency . the decrease ( ) and increase ( ) of the axial trap frequency is 19% at 450  g for the loss rate measurements presented in this paper and is corrected for in the analysis .",
    "furthermore , the curvature effectively leads to a decrease of the trap depth for atoms in the  state , so that for a particular odt power there is a maximum magnetic field beyond which all bose - condensed  atoms escape from the trap .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field across the bec in the odt is on the order of 1  mg and plays no role in this study .",
    "the number of trapped @xmath0he@xmath7  atoms is measured by turning off the odt , which causes the atoms to fall and be detected by a micro - channel plate ( mcp ) detector , which is located 17  cm below the trap center and gives rise to a time - of - flight of approximately 186  ms . from a bimodal fit to the mcp signal , the bec and thermal fraction are extracted as well as the temperature and the chemical potential , @xmath39 , of the trapped gas  @xcite .",

    "the reason for performing this initial spin - flip is that absorption imaging showed that , unlike  atoms , hot atoms in the  state would remain trapped in the wings of the crossed odt due to the additional trapping force resulting from the residual magnetic - field curvature . after 500  ms of rethermalization time , either another spin - flip procedure is performed in which case trap loss experiments for  atoms are investigated , or , atoms remain in the  state .",

    "our measured @xmath50 coefficient is interesting in the context of universal few - body physics  @xcite , as the interactions in a spin - polarized @xmath0he@xmath7  gas are governed by a large two - body scattering length with @xmath54 .",
    "we note that recent theoretical few - body studies have focussed on ground state @xmath0he and alkali atoms with tunable scattering length around a feshbach resonance . even though spin - polarized @xmath0he@xmath7  atoms do not provide a tunable scattering length",
    ", it does provide an interesting benchmark system because of very accurate knowledge of the two - body potential  @xcite and can be used to study effects beyond universal theory ( i.e. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "future experiments will advance in the direction of ultracold @xmath5he@xmath7-@xmath0he@xmath7  mixtures  @xcite .",
    "@xmath5he@xmath7  has nuclear spin , but because of its inverted hyperfine splitting , the lowest spin state is spin - stretched .",
    "therefore , a mixture of @xmath5he@xmath7-@xmath0he@xmath7  prepared in the lowest spin channel is also stable against penning ionization as well as sr and ripi which are energetically not allowed .",
    "this stability provides an ideal starting point to prepare an ultracold mixture in the dipole trap at large magnetic fields in order to explore the recently - predicted 800-g broad interspecies feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
