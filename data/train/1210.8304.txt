    ", we consider the causality constraints for the scattering of two charged particles with an arbitrary finite - range interaction .",
    "our analysis is the first study of causality bounds that takes into account the long - range coulomb force .",
    "the results presented here are relevant to studies of low - energy scattering of nuclei and nucleons using effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "in particular , they are important for the application of effective field theory to nuclear halo systems ( cf .  refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this so - called halo eft utilizes the separation of energy scales between the internal excitations of the core nucleus and soft halo physics .",
    "an effective lagrangian is built order by order from local interactions and used to describe low - energy phenomena such as shallow bound states , charge radii , near - threshold resonances , radiative capture reactions , and soft photodissociation .",

    "@xcite have been studied as well as various two - neutron halo systems  @xcite .",
    "there is an important connection between causality bounds and the convergence of effective field theory calculations with increasing order  @xcite . for local contact interactions ,",
    "the range of the effective interaction is controlled by the momentum cutoff scale of the effective theory . in effective theories with non - perturbative renormalization , which typically occur in nuclear physics , exact cutoff - independence",
    "can generally not be achieved .",
    "there is a `` natural '' value of the cutoff at which all higher - order corrections scale as expected from dimensional analysis .",
    "if the cutoff is taken larger , `` new physics '' intervenes , the corrections scale unnaturally , and unitarity violations may occur .",
    "this is different from what one encounters in high - energy particle physics where the renormalization is typically perturbative and cutoff momenta can be taken arbitrarily large . for calculations using dimensional regularization ,",
    "the renormalization scale plays a similar role in regulating ultraviolet physics .",
    "the term `` new physics '' , in this context , refers to details left out ( integrated out ) in the effective theory . in the case of halo eft ,",
    "these details are the finite size of the core nucleus and its internal excitations as well as the exponential tail of the pion - exchange interaction . problems with convergence of the effective theory can occur if the cutoff scale is set higher than the scale of the new physics .",
    "however , it is useful to have a more quantitative measure of when problems may appear , and this is where the causality bound provides a useful diagnostic tool . for each scattering channel",
    "we use the physical scattering parameters to compute a quantity called the causal range , @xmath7 .",
    "it is the minimum range for finite - range interactions consistent with the requirements of causality and unitarity . for any fixed cutoff scale ,",
    "the causality bound marks a branch cut of the effective theory when viewed as a function of physical scattering parameters  @xcite .",
    "the coupling constants of the effective theory become complex when scattering parameters violating the causality bound are enforced .",
    "these branch cuts do not appear in perturbation theory ; however , a nearby branch point can spoil the absolute convergence of the perturbative expansion .",
    "our results can be viewed as a guide for improving the convergence of halo eft calculations . in particular ,",
    "if the cutoff momentum used in a calculation is too high , then problems with convergence may appear in some observables .",
    "consequently , the causal range can be used to estimate the `` natural '' ultraviolet cutoff @xmath8 of the effective theory as @xmath9 .",
    "the natural cutoff is optimal in the sense that no known infrared physics is left out of the theory and that all corrections involving the ultraviolet cutoff scale naturally  @xcite .",
    "increasing the cutoff beyond the natural value will not improve the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "the causality bounds also have an impact in the regime of bound states . for two - body halo states , or more generally whenever there is a shallow two - body bound state close to threshold , the same integral identity that yields the causality bound for the effective range can be used to derive a relation between the asymptotic normalization constant ( anc ) of the bound - state wave function , the binding momentum , and the effective range for the scattering of the two halo constituents .",
    "this relation can be shown to be equivalent to a result previously derived by sparenberg  _ et al . _",
    "its significance lies in the fact that the anc is an important input parameter for the calculation of near - threshold radiative capture and photodissociation reactions .",
    "the causality bounds also constrain the range of model potentials that are fitted to scattering data in order to extract ancs .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first review the general theory of scattering for two charged particles with additional short - range interactions .",
    "our analysis includes both attractive and repulsive coulomb forces . in the next section",
    "we derive the charged - particle causality bounds for arbitrary values of the orbital angular momentum . using the causality bounds , we extract and discuss the causal range for several nuclear scattering processes including proton  proton , proton ",
    "deuteron , proton@xmath10he , proton  alpha , and alpha  alpha scattering .",
    "we then elucidate the relation for the anc and extract the ancs of the excited @xmath0 and @xmath1 states in @xmath2o from @xmath3c scattering data as an application .",
    "we conclude with a summary of the main results and provide an outlook . in the appendices , we provide technical details of the derivation as well as numerical examples .",
    "in this section , we review some preliminaries that we will need later in order to derive the desired causality bounds .",
    "we consider a two - particle system with reduced mass @xmath11 interacting via a finite - range potential with range @xmath12 .",
    "we write the interaction as a real symmetric operator with kernel @xmath13 satisfying the finite - range condition , @xmath14 in particular , we assume that the interaction is energy - independent . after giving a detailed formal derivation of the causality bounds in what follows , we will come back to the question what the above assumptions mean for the application to ( halo ) eft calculations in sec .",

    "similar to the case of neutral particles without coulomb interaction  @xcite , our considerations lead to a constraint on the maximum value of the coulomb - modified effective range .    while conceptionally straightforward , the calculation of the wronskians of the wave functions required for the derivation of the bound is intricate .",
    "we have calculated them through term - by - term integration of the power series expansion of the zero - energy wave functions and additionally determining the integration constants that are not generated by this process .",

    "if the momentum cutoff used in a calculation is too high , then problems with convergence of higher order corrections can appear .",
    "for example , the convergence pattern might be such that an improvement in higher orders of the eft can only be sustained through large cancellations between individual terms",
    ". such an unnatural pattern would be especially undesirable for the stability of numerical ( lattice ) calculations .",
    "our results can thus be viewed as a guide for improving the convergence pattern of eft calculations with contact interactions . in lattice simulations of halo eft , the lattice spacing should not be taken smaller than the causal range .",
    "we have analyzed the causal ranges for a variety of systems ranging from proton  proton scattering to alpha  alpha scattering .",
    "our results for causal ranges in different partial waves in these systems typically vary by factors of 2 - 3 .",
    "the precise values are quite sensitive to small uncertainties in the effective range parameters . in channels with",
    "a large negative effective range the causal range is very close to zero , which implies that causality provides almost no constraints on the range of the interaction in this case .",
