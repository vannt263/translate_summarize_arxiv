    "collisions of high - energy heavy - ions , at the brookhaven relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , allow us to create and study the properties of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the laboratory .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy in particle production is , at these energies , an observable which provides experimental information on the equation of state and the transport properties of the qgp .",
    "this anisotropy is usually characterized by the fourier flow - coefficients  @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the azimuthal angle of the particles , @xmath6 is the @xmath7-order flow plane ( or named final state symmetry plane ) angle and @xmath8 denotes an average over the selected particles and events .",
    "experimental measurements together with comparisons to theoretical calculations show that anisotropic flow sheds new light on the initial conditions and is sensitive to the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath9 of the qgp .",

    "the comparisons to hydrodynamic and ampt model calculations will be discussed below .",
    "the data used in this analysis were recorded with the alice detector in november 2015 in run 2 at the lhc with pb - pb collisions at @xmath11 tev .",
    "about 140 k pb  pb events were recorded with a minimum - bias trigger , based on signals from two vzero detectors ( -3.7@xmath12 - 1.7 for vzero - c and 2.8@xmath125.1 for vzero - a ) and on the silicon pixel detector .",
    "the vzero detectors were also used for the determination of the collision centrality in pb  pb collisions .",

    "both two - particle correlations with pseudorapidity and multi - particle cumulants methods are used in these measurements .",

    "@xmath23 0.002 ( syst . ) .",
    "similar centrality dependence is observed in the measurements of multi - particle cumulants @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and results are agree within 1% . assuming that non - flow effects are suppressed by the pseudorapidity gap , the remaining differences between two- and multi - particle cumulants of @xmath19 can be attributed to the different sensitivities to elliptic flow fluctuations .",
    "compared to @xmath0 , higher harmonics i.e.  @xmath1 and @xmath2 are smaller and the centrality dependence is much weaker . in addition , the hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite which combine the changes in initial spatial anisotropy and the hydrodynamic response are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "( a ) for comparison .",
    "the calculations are found to be compatible with the measured anisotropic flow @xmath18 coefficients .",
    "furthermore , using a new set of lund string fragmentation parameters and partonic cross section 3 mb , the ampt model with string melting scenario can quantitatively reproduce the anisotropic flow measurements  @xcite .    to better illustrate the energy evolution of anisotropic flow , fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) shows the ratios of @xmath18 measured at 5.02 tev to 2.76 tev .",
    "it is observed that the increase of @xmath19 and @xmath20 from the two energies is rather moderate , while for @xmath21 it is more pronounced .",
    "considering none of the ratios of flow harmonics from two energies exhibit a significant centrality dependence in the centrality range 050% , a fit with a constant value are performed for these ratios .",

    "for these fully @xmath14 integrated coefficients , an increase of @xmath36 is observed going from @xmath28 to 5.02 tev , which is close to values of the previously - mentioned hydrodynamic calculations @xcite .",
