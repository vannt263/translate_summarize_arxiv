    "in the last few years a new solar problem has emerged .",
    "recent determinations of the photospheric heavy element abundances @xcite indicate that the sun metallicity is lower than previously assumed @xcite .",
    "solar models that incorporate these lower abundances are no more able to reproduce the helioseismic results . as an example , the sound speed predicted by standard solar models ( ssms ) implementing the heavy element admixture of @xcite disagrees at the bottom of the convective envelope by @xmath0 with the value inferred by helioseismic data ( see e.g. @xcite and black dashed line in fig.[fig1 ] ) . in addition , the predicted surface helium abundance is lower by @xmath1 and the radius of the convective envelope is larger by @xmath2 with respect to the helioseismic results .",
    "detailed studies have been done to resolve this controversy , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the latest determinations of the solar photospheric composition @xcite alleviate the discrepancies but a definitive solution of the `` solar composition problem '' still has to be obtained .",
    "the main effect of changing the heavy element admixture is to modify the opacity profile of the sun .",
    "it is , thus , evident that the comprehension of the solar composition problem is intimately related to understanding the role of opacity in solar modelling .",
    "several authors have investigated the effects of opacity changes on the solar structure by using different methods and assumptions ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . here , we continue their work , completing and extending the analysis of @xcite by using a different and original approach .",
    "the final goal is to provide the instruments to analyze in transparent and efficient way the role of the opacity in the sun and to perform a critical `` step - by - step '' discussion of the present constraints on opacity ( and composition ) provided by observable properties of the sun .    in order to calculate the effects of arbitrary opacity changes on the sun , we use the linear solar model ( lsm ) approach , presented in @xcite and briefly summarized in the appendix . in this approach ,",
    "the structure equations of the present sun are linearized and , by estimating the ( variation of ) the present solar composition from the ( variation of ) the nuclear reaction rates and elemental diffusion efficiency in the present sun , we obtain a linear system of ordinary differential equations that can be easily solved and that completely determines the physical and chemical properties of the sun .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this kind of approach reproduces with good accuracy the results of non - linear evolutionary solar models and , thus , can be used to study the role of parameters and assumptions in solar model construction .    by considering localised opacity changes in lsm approach ,",
    "we determine numerically the kernels that , in a linear approximation , relate an arbitrary opacity variation to the corresponding modification of the solar observable properties",
    ". these opacity kernels are useful in several respects .",
    "first , they allow us to individuate the region of the sun whose opacity is probed with maximal sensitivity by each observable quantity .",
    "then , they permit us to show that effects produced by variations of opacity in different region of the sun can compensate among each others .",
    "finally , they will be used to discuss how the different pieces of observational information cooperate to determine the present constraints on the opacity profile of the sun .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sect .",

    "moreover , effects produced by variations of opacity in distinct zones of the sun may compensate among each other . in this respect , we noted that _ the sound speed @xmath50 and the depth of the convective envelope @xmath8 are practically insensitive to a global rescaling of the opacity .",
    "_    _ iv ) _ as a consequence of the above result , we have seen that the discrepancy between the ssm predictions for @xmath50 and @xmath8 and the helioseismic inferred values can be equally solved by a @xmath222 decrease of the opacity a the center of the sun or by a @xmath223 increase of the opacity in the external radiative region .",
    "the degeneracy between these two possible solutions is broken by the `` orthogonal '' information provided by the measurements of the surface helium abundance and of the boron and beryllium neutrino fluxes , that fix the scale of opacity and indicate that only the second possibility can effectively solve the solar composition problem .",
