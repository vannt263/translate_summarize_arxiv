    "like many accreting pulsars , the history of the pulse period of 4u  0352 + 309 shows both episodes of spin - up and spin - down ( * ? ? ?",

    "the neutron star experienced a large apparent torque reversal around 1978 .",
    "4u  1626@xmath1167 @xcite and gx  1 + 4 @xcite have exhibited similar torque reversals , and in both sources the mean spin - up and spin - down rates were similar in absolute magnitude .",
    "previous to 1978 the spin history of 4u  0352 + 309 was erratic ; however , there was a general trend toward spin - up at a rate of @xmath12yr@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "since 1978 , although the spin period measurements have been infrequent the star has been spinning down at an average rate of @xmath14yr@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately there are not enough spin period measurements to distinguish between steady spin down , as might be due to disk accretion , or the erratic torque fluctuations that would be expected from wind accretion .",
    "an unusual aspect of 4u  0352 + 309 is the source s x - ray  spectrum .",
    "most accreting x - ray  pulsar spectra are well described by a standard model : a simple power - law with a photon index of @xmath01 that is exponentially cutoff above @xmath020kev @xcite .",
    "4u  0352 + 309 , on the other hand , does not follow this standard spectral shape and as a result has been fit with a variety of different models .",
    "observations lacking response below @xmath02kev have typically been fit with thin thermal bremsstrahlung emission in the temperature range 712kev @xcite or thermal bremsstrahlung with a high energy tail @xcite .",
    "observations obtained with the _ tenma _",
    "@xcite , _ exosat _",
    "@xcite , and _",
    "ginga_@xcite satellites were fit by the standard model for binary x - ray  pulsars , but required very low cutoff energies ( in the range of 0.61.7kev ) that are atypical of most accreting pulsars @xcite .",
    "furthermore the _ ginga _  result , where the data extended to higher energies , showed evidence for a hard tail above @xmath015kev .",
    "recently @xcite fit the broad band ( 0.1200kev ) _ _ beppo__sax  x - ray  spectrum with a combination of two power - laws .",
    "the first , which was important at lower energies , had a simple high - energy cutoff and was identical in form to the standard spectral model for accreting pulsars .",
    "the second power - law , which dominated above @xmath015kev , had both high and low - energy cutoffs .    with the broad energy ranges and good spectral resolution of satellites such as the _ rxte _  and _ _ beppo__sax , several new cyclotron resonance scattering features(crsfs )",
    "have been discovered in well known accreting pulsars .",
    "two of the most notable recent discoveries are cen  x@xmath113 @xcite and 4u  1626@xmath1167 @xcite .",
    "these line - like spectral features are thought to be due to resonant scattering by electrons in landau orbits in the @xmath0@xmath15 g magnetic field of the neutron star . the crsf  centroid energy is given by @xmath16kev , where @xmath9 is the gravitational redshift in the scattering region and @xmath17 is the magnetic field in units of @xmath15 gauss .",
    "thus crsfs  give a direct measurement of the average magnetic field in the scattering region near the neutron star surface .",
    "without a crsf  the magnetic dipole moment of the star can only be inferred from measurements of the luminosity ( a function of the often uncertain distance ) and spin period using accretion torque theory @xcite .",
    "even the radio pulsar magnetic fields are estimated , not directly measured , assuming dipole radiation and measuring the period and period derivative @xcite .",
    "the observations of 4u  0352 + 309 studied here were made using the two pointed instruments on the _ rxte_. the proportional counter array(pca , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a set of five identical xenon proportional counters ( proportional counter units , or pcus ) sensitive in the energy range 260kev .",
    "the pca  can , and sometimes does , operate with one or more of the individual pcus  turned off .",
    "this is done to extend the lifetime of the instrument , but reduces the effective area during those observations .",
    "the high energy x - ray timing experiment(hexte , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) consists of two clusters of 4 nai(tl)/csi(na ) phoswich scintillation detectors ( 15250kev ) that rock on and off source , simultaneously measuring both source and background counts .",
    "one of the detectors in cluster b suffered a failed pulse height analyzer early in the mission and no longer provides any spectral information , effectively reducing the area of that cluster by 25% .",
    "the pca  and hexte  fields of view are co - aligned on - source and are collimated to the same 1full width half maximum ( fwhm ) region .",
    "we have used data from 40 pointings from the _ rxte _  public archive ( see table  [ table : obs ] ) spanning from 1998 july 1 through 1999 february 27 , roughly one binary orbit of the system .",
    "this is a subset of the observations used by @xcite , allowing us to use their orbital ephemeris in our timing analysis .",
    "these observations were chosen for their relatively short intervals between pointings ( on average 6 days ) , which minimizes the possibility of long - term spectral variability and yet provides enough data for a suitable detection of the source .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : asm ] for the _ rxte_/asm  history of the source , along with the times of the _ rxte _  pointings .    for the pca  we used goodxenon mode data with pcus  0 , 1 , and 2 only , as these were the only pca  detectors that were on during all of the observations .",
    "the total pca  on - source exposure was 161ks with 3 pcus , and the on - source livetime in hexte  was 54.6ks per cluster .",
    "the average pca  325kev counting rate was 20.6@xmath100.1@xmath18 .",
    "in hexte  the counting rate was 1.78@xmath100.06@xmath19  in cluster a and 1.30@xmath100.05@xmath19  in cluster b. the average 3100kev x - ray  flux from the source over the course of the observations was 3.9@xmath20@xmath21 . at a distance of 0.95kpc @xcite the source luminosity is 4.2@xmath22@xmath2 .",
    "this is at least two orders of magnitude less than the typical @xmath23-@xmath24@xmath2  luminosities seen in other persistent accreting pulsars or transient pulsars while in outburst .",
    "the phase averaged pca  and hexte  spectra were accumulated using version 5.0.1 of the heasoft tools .",
    "even though the average pca  counting rate was below the 40@xmath18  threshold for using the faint source background model , the large pulse modulation often brought the instantaneous counting well above , at times over 100@xmath18 .",
    "since we can not , at this time , phase resolve the background spectra of the pca , we were forced to use the bright - source skyvle model .",
    "the faint source model , which relies partly on average counting rates , significantly over - predicted the background level . in particular , the modeled faint source background was larger than the measured source plus background for the phase minimum at all energies . the skyvle model ,",
    "on the other hand , predicted a background rate that was less than source plus background for all four phases .",
    "these models also gave background subtractions that were consistent with zero at high energies , where 4u  0352 + 309 was too weak to detect .",
    "therefore we concluded that it was appropriate to use the the skyvle models for our pca  background subtraction .",
    "since the hexte  uses a measured background accumulated in the same way as the source pointings , it did not suffer these problems .",
    "the estimated error of the hexte  background subtraction is a few tenths of a percent @xcite , while the source flux of 4u  0352 + 309 is 1.7% of background .    in order to study the evolution of the spectrum through the pulse , and to aid in the search for crsfs , we performed pulse phase resolved spectral analysis as well .",
    "the spectra of accreting x - ray  pulsars can vary considerably with pulse phase @xcite .",
    "this is easily seen in the folded light curves ( flcs ) of these sources , where the general trend is toward more complicated pulse shapes at lower energies , and larger pulsed fractions at higher energies .",
    "this two dimensional nature can make interpreting spectra averaged over an entire pulse period problematic .",
    "we corrected photon arrival times to both the solar system and the binary system barycenters using the ephemeris of @xcite and accumulated spectra using a locally modified version of the _ fasebin _  phase resolved accumulation ftool .",
    "the _ fasebin _",
    "ftool produces a two dimensional counts histogram versus both phase and energy , allowing for an analysis of spectra as a function of phase , or folded light curves as a function of energy .",
    "modifications to the _ fasebin _  ftool were made to take the hexte  deadtime corrections into account properly and to allow for phase resolving the hexte  background files .",
    "phase resolving the background is important for long period pulsars , where the background level can vary over the course of a single pulse . given the relatively simple , saw - tooth like pulse shape of 4u  0352 + 309 and the faintness of the source , we divided the pulse into four phase bins ; peak , fall , min , and rise ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pca_hardness ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the pca  spectra , with its large collecting area and thus excellent counting statistics , are dominated by the systematic errors in the response matrix and background modeling @xcite . to estimate the size of the systematic errors in the pca  version 2.43 response matrix ,",
    "we analyzed observations of the crab nebula and pulsar as recommended by the pca  team @xcite . to be able to compare directly to our 4u  0352 + 309 composite spectrum , we summed 10 crab observations taken between 1998 july 27 and 1999 february 24 , for a total pcaexposure of 8ks .",
    "to fit these data , we used a combination of two power - laws .",
    "the first power - law , with a best fit photon index of @xmath25 , was to account for the nebular flux .",
    "the second , which modeled emission from the pulsar , had a photon index of @xmath26 and a 210kev normalization fixed to be 10% of the first @xcite .",
    "we then examined the best fit and increased the size of the systematic errors as a function of energy until we achieved a reduced @xmath27  of unity .",
    "the second power - law is important in this type of analysis , since ignoring the contribution of the pulsar would have led us to estimate larger systematic errors .",
    "the systematic errors we used were 0.4% in the range 212.5kev , 0.3% in 12.520.5kev , and 2.4% above 20.5kev .",
    "these are slightly smaller than the errors used by other authors ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , due in part to the dual power - law model used and improvements in the current response matrices ( pcarsp v2.43 ) .",
    "the effects of increasing the systematic errors reduces the formal significance of the crsf  by improving @xmath27 , as well as increasing the uncertainties of the fit parameters .",
    "however , such an increase does not affect the overall shape of the residual errors , especially the line - like shape in the hextedata around 30kev .",
    "the errors of the hexte  data are dominated by the counting statistics @xcite , so systematic errors were not applied .    in our analysis of 4u  0352 + 309",
    "we truncated the pca  energy range at 25kev .",
    "this was done to minimize the effects of the large systematic errors above 20kev , while still allowing a significant overlap between the pca  and hexte  energy ranges .",
    "we fit the pca  simultaneously with data from both hexteclusters in the range 16100kev , with the overall normalization of each hexte  cluster allowed to vary with respect to the pca  in the fits .",
    "one of our major concerns was the validity of summing a large number of short pointings , taken over the course of 8 months , into a single set of spectra .",
    "this is especially dangerous when searching for crsfs , as averaging different power - law slopes could artificially create a dip - like or inflection feature in the spectrum .",
    "the pulse profile of 4u  0352 + 309 is also known to vary from pulse to pulse @xcite , and due to the long pulse period there are fewer than 6 pulses in any given 5ks observation .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray  spectra of accretion powered pulsars , especially wind fed systems , can vary dramatically with both time and luminosity @xcite .",
    "we took great care to ensure that the spectra we analyzed were free from these effects .    since the separation of 4u 0352 + 309 and x  per is quite large ( 2.2au , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the system is almost certainly wind fed .",
    "but because of the modest eccentricity ( e=0.11 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we did not expect the effects of the stellar wind to vary dramatically with the orbit .",
    "furthermore , the small inferred inclination angle ( @xmath28 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies that the system is not being viewed through a ( possibly variable ) stellar or accretion disk .",
    "because of this we did not expect significant variations in the absorption column , and thus in low energy spectral shape , over time . additionally , although no single observation was long enough to make a significant detection of a crsf , the longest single pointing suggested that there might indeed be one .",
    "therefore we were motivated to investigate whether we could discuss the average spectrum of 4u  0352 + 309 .",
    "first we tested whether or not the pulse shape converged to an average , repeatable shape .",
    "we divided the 40 pointings into 5 contiguous sets of observations , with each segment containing approximately 38 pulses .",
    "we then did a two component fit of each of the five 325kev flcs to the average flc , allowing for both an additive offset in rate and an overall multiplicative factor .",
    "this allowed for possible errors in the background subtraction and tested the repeatability of the overall shape , but was insensitive to changes in pulsed fraction .",
    "the fit offsets were small , only 34% of the rate in each phase bin .",
    "the scatter around the mean flc  gave reduced @xmath27s of 1.05 , 0.66 , 0.59 , 0.67 , and 0.91 in the 5 data segments .",
    "so , as with other accreting pulsars , the pulse shape variations of 4u  0352 + 309 converge to an average pulse shape that is stable at least over several months .",
    "next we sought to verify whether the average pulse was similar to previous observations .",
    "in particular 4u  0352 + 309 has shown a peak in hardness at pulse minimum @xcite . using the spectra from our phase",
    "resolved analysis we generated folded light curves in the 24 and 411kev bands and created a hardness ratio through the pulse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pca_hardness ] ) . as in previous observations ,",
    "we see a nearly constant hardness ratio though the peak of the pulse as well as a hard spike at pulse minimum .",
    "this consistent behavior suggests that summing a series of short observations would be nearly equivalent to a single long pointing .",
    "we also note that the hard spike is very prominent in our data , similar to what was observed with _",
    "exosat_@xcite and _ ginga _",
    "@xcite , while the spike was much less pronounced during the _ _",
    "beppo__sax  observation @xcite .",
    "lastly , we investigated whether or not the spectral shapes in the five data segments were consistent with the average spectral shape . to account for the fact that the 5 intervals had different amounts of time in different parts of the pulse , we used background subtracted spectra that were also resolved into our 4 phase bins ( see above ) , giving a total of 20 spectra to be tested . then , for the 5 segments in each phase bin , we took the ratio of the 325kev pca  counts to that of the total counts spectrum ( also background subtracted ) for that phase bin , and calculated the reduced @xmath27  assuming a constant ratio .",
    "this was done for all 4 phases .",
    "see table  [ table:5segfits ] for the results of this analysis .",
    "we found that the spectral shape in the 5 data segments , at least in the 325kev range , is consistent with being constant .",
    "therefore , due to the stability of the pulse and spectral shapes over the course of our observations , we concluded that summing data from all of the observations would not introduce a significant artifact in a given phase bin or for the phase averaged spectrum .",
    "identifying crsfs  in the spectrum of accreting pulsars can be problematic , especially when the underlying continuum is unknown . however , in the case of 4u  0352 + 309 a large feature is clearly visible at @xmath050kev in the counts spectra of the source ( fig .",
    "[ fig : counts ] ) , and is especially evident in the falling edge of the pulse peak . this same feature is also visible in a shorter observation ( @xmath010ks ) made early on in the _ rxte_mission .",
    "this feature is not present in counts spectra successfully fit with the standard model of accreting pulsars , but would be expected if there were also resonant cyclotron scattering present in the source .",
    "we were therefore motivated to find a simple and physically reasonable continuum spectrum that would describe the data .",
    "in our fits we fixed the neutral hydrogen column to be @xmath29@xmath30 , based on measurements from satellites with significant response below 1kev ( for example _ rosat _ , @xcite , _ bbxrt _ , @xcite , _ copernicus _ , @xcite , and _",
    "_ beppo__sax , @xcite ) .",
    "this is an order of magnitude smaller than measurements made by instruments lacking response below @xmath02kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is difficult for these instruments ( e.g. _ ginga _  and _ rxte _ ) to measure such a low column .",
    "the fitting is also complicated by the fact that there is a change or break in spectrum at @xmath02kev , as revealed by instruments such as _ exosat _",
    "@xcite and _ bbxrt _  @xcite .",
    "this change can explain why instruments without low energy response systematically measure a column which is larger by an order of magnitude .",
    "starting with models used historically for 4u  0352 + 309 ( see   [ sec : intro ] ) , we first attempted to fit the _ rxte _  data with a thermal bremsstrahlung model both with and without a power - law tail .",
    "we found that these models gave poor fits to the data when the absorption column was fixed at 1.5@xmath31@xmath30 . when the amount of absorption was allowed to vary we achieved acceptable fits , but these required an unreasonably large column ( @xmath32@xmath30 ) and were consistent with previous observations where a thin thermal plasma model has been applied to @xmath33kev data .",
    "the thermal model also suffers from no iron line ever being detected in this source ( with an upper limit on the equivalent width of @xmath06ev , @xcite ) .",
    "because of this and the large inferred absorption column we have rejected the bremsstrahlung and bremsstrahlung plus power law tail continuum models .    in the _ rxte _  band , the standard model used to describe accreting x - ray  pulsars is a power - law that breaks into a power - law times an exponential at a characteristic cutoff energy .",
    "historically this has been realized in the plcut  form @xmath34 where @xmath35  is the photon power - law index , and @xmath36  and @xmath37are the cutoff and folding energies respectively .",
    "other analytical forms have been used as well , such as the fermi - dirac form of the cutoff ( fdco , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the negative and positive power - law exponential  model ( npex , * ? ? ?",
    "for a full review of the various phenomenological models see @xcite .",
    "this generic spectral shape can be interpreted as due to comptonization of soft photons by the hot accreting electrons , with the cutoff and folding energies determined by the temperature of the infalling electrons .    when we applied these models ( plcut , fdco , and npex ) we found that they were inadequate to describe the shape of the spectra .",
    "as with _ ginga _",
    "@xcite , there appeared to be a power - law tail extending beyond @xmath015kev .",
    "our inferred values of cutoff energy were below 3kev ( and outside the pca  energy range ) , also consistent with previous results .",
    "moreover , the `` tail '' at higher energies was still present when we fit the pulse peak minus pulse minimum , confirming that it is pulsed emission from 4u  0352 + 309 and not a contaminating background source such as an agn .",
    "however , the simple addition of an extra power - law to the model , or even a second plcut , still gave unacceptable fits .",
    "specifically these were unable to account for the dip seen at @xmath035kev .",
    "this motivated us to try other two component models .    di salvo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) fit the _ _",
    "beppo__sax  spectrum of 4u  0352 + 309 with a dual plcut  model .",
    "the first plcut  had a cutoff energy of @xmath02kev .",
    "the second , which was only important above @xmath015kev where there was `` extra '' emission , had a cutoff energy of 66kev and an exponentially shaped low - energy absorption term with a 44kev folding energy .",
    "the cross over of the two components was at @xmath015kev , and the second component fits the excess `` tail '' not described by the lower energy component .",
    "we applied this model to our observations as well and achieved a reduced @xmath27  of 1.25 for 79 degrees of freedom for the phase averaged spectrum .",
    "the shape of the spectrum , however , was noticeably different from that obtained by @xcite .",
    "in particular , the high energy photon index we obtained was smaller ( although within errors , 1.5@xmath100.6 vs. 2.6@xmath101.1 ) and the low energy exponential absorption folding energy an order of magnitude less ( @xmath38 vs. 44.3@xmath104.5kev ) .",
    "furthermore , the _ rxte _  fits using this model were improved by the addition of a crsf  at @xmath030kev , giving a reduced @xmath27of 0.753 for 76 degrees of freedom .",
    "this difference between the spectra obtained with the _ _",
    "beppo__sax  and the _ rxte _  satellites could be real , possibly connected with variations of the source luminosity . the 110kev flux during the _",
    "beppo__sax  observation was 1.7@xmath20@xmath21  @xcite , while the 1.710kev flux in our observation was 2.1@xmath20@xmath21 , or 23% higher .",
    "furthermore , the _ rxte_/asm  source flux in the week spanning the _ _",

    "[ fig : asm ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the spectrum of accreting low - luminosity neutron stars ( @xmath39@xmath21 ) could exhibit a cyclotron _ emission _ line .",
    "this feature is expected to be broad ( @xmath40 ) , peak at energies below the fundamental cyclotron energy of the magnetic field , and be sharply cutoff above the cyclotron energy .",
    "di salvo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) interpreted the second plcut  in their spectrum as evidence for this feature . since the second component in our fits was different from that obtained with the _ _",
    "beppo__sax , and quite unlike an emission line , we attempted to test the @xcite prediction with some slightly different models .",
    "we fit the phase averaged spectrum with the standard plcut  and fdco  forms , plus an additional gaussian shaped emission line , both with and without a high - energy cutoff .",
    "the gaussian was meant to fit the peak near 50kev , while the cutoff was used to truncate the high - energy wing of the gaussian to simulate the predicted steep fall at the cyclotron energy .",
    "the folding energy of the cutoff associated with the gaussian component was allowed to vary , but constrained to be within 0.110kev .",
    "we found that the presence of a cutoff did nt change the fits significantly , and we were unable to achieve any reasonable fits using an emission line model .",
    "we have found a two component model that both best described the data and had a simple physical interpretation .",

    "see table  [ table : bbodyfits ] for the best fit parameters and fig .",
    "[ fig : phavg ] for the phase averaged spectrum .",
    "as in previous observations of the source we found no evidence of an fe - k line in the spectrum , with a 90% confidence upper limit on the equivalent width of 13ev for a gaussian line centered at 6.4kev and with a 0.5kev sigma .",

    "the black - body temperature remained constant , to within errors , with pulse phase .",
    "we note , however , that the formal errors on the black - body component are small ( only 20ev for the temperature ) .",
    "factors such as the fixed value for the absorption column and the spectrum below 1kev , which is not measured with the _ rxte _  and was fit with a slightly different shape in the _ _",

    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] for the two model components in the inferred phase average photon spectrum .",
    "the absorption line model used in the fits was a multiplicative exponential of the form @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the optical depth of the absorption as a function of energy .",
    "the functional form of @xmath44 is given by the gaussian @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the centroid energy ( also called line energy ) , @xmath47 is the width , and @xmath48  is the optical depth at the crsfenergy .",
    "we interpret this feature as a 29kev crsf .",
    "it was present in all four phases ; however , it was only weakly detected during the rise of the pulse . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] we plot the ratio of the data to the best fit model , both before and after the addition of a crsf  to the model . because there are simply more counts at energies below the centroid energy , the errors are smaller and have a greater effect on the fitting process .",
    "when fitting without a crsf , these smaller errors drive the continuum to fit the low side of the line and under predict the continuum at higher energies .",
    "this gives rise to a dip followed by a rise in a ratio plot  a classic signature of a crsf .",
    "these dips are especially evident in the pulse fall and minimum in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] .",

    "additionally , when we take the ratio of the 4u  0352 + 309 counts spectrum to that of the crab , we still see a line - like structure . since the spectrum of 4u  0352 + 309 is a power - law ( with the exception of the crsf ) in the hexte  band , this ratio is , to first order , free of instrumental effects .",
    "lastly , we fit the data using a set of intermediate response matrices provided by the hexte  instrument team .",
    "the released version of the hexte  response matrices are derived from these , but have had the diagonal elements adjusted slightly to give a smooth fit to the crab and account for calibration errors near the k - edge .",
    "the intermediate matrices , which are based solely upon modeling of the detectors and calibration data , have residual errors that are @xmath102% in the region of the k - edge .",
    "when we fit our 4u  0352 + 309 spectrum with these unreleased matrices @xmath27  becomes worse ; however , the line width and energy remain unchanged . due of this analysis",
    "we conclude that the feature is intrinsic to the source , and not due to any instrumental problems or artifacts .",
    "we further conclude that the crsf  fit parameters are not significantly affected by the instrumental calibration .    from the pulse peak through minimum",
    "the crsf  energy is constant to within errors and is quite broad .",
    "the fit parameters are also consistent with the phase averaged spectrum . at pulse minimum",
    "a feature can be clearly seen in the pattern of ratios , although the statistics in this phase bin are quite low .",
    "the addition of a crsf  is not formally required by the fits , since a reduced @xmath27  of 0.96 can be achieved without it .",
    "however , the addition of a crsf  at 30@xmath106kev greatly improves the fits , with an f - test chance probability of @xmath49 .",
    "the fit crsf  during the pulse rise is quite different than the other phases .",
    "specifically , it appears at a lower energy than in the other three phases ( 21 instead of @xmath029kev ) and with a shallower depth .",
    "the crsf  also falls in the region of overlap between the pca  and hexte  instruments , and due to its width is not completely resolved by either instrument . because of this the fitted crsf  might be an artifact .",
    "we do note , however , that the width of the crsf  is , as a percentage of the centroid value , similar to the other three phases , and the temperature of the soft component and power - law index are consistent with the other pulse phases .",
    "we also conducted a search for a crsf  second harmonic .",
    "multiple harmonics have been detected in sources such as 4u  0115 + 63 @xcite and 4u  1907 + 09 @xcite , and so it is not unreasonable to search for one in this source as well .",
    "there appears , however , to be no evidence for a higher harmonic at @xmath060kev .",
    "our statistics in that range are poor and resolving a line would be difficult . using the phase average spectra we added a crsf  fixed at twice the energy and width of the fundamental .",
    "we then increased the depth parameter until the @xmath27  changed by 2.7 ( for one interesting parameter ) , and were able to obtain a 90% confidence upper limit of 0.25 on the depth of a second harmonic .",
    "since the discovery of the first cyclotron resonance scattering feature in the spectrum of her  x-1 @xcite , there have been only about a dozen firm detections of crsfs  out of the @xmath050 known accreting x - ray  pulsars @xcite . with this analysis we have added another , namely 4u  0352 + 309 .",
    "the magnetic field at the polar cap implied by a 29kev crsf  is @xmath50 g ( where @xmath9 is the gravitational redshift in the scattering region ) . assuming the radius and mass of the neutron star to be 10 km and 1.4@xmath51  respectively , and that the cyclotron scattering is occurring at the magnetic polar cap ,",
    "then the magnetic field is @xmath52 g .",
    "this field strength is well within the range of other accreting pulsars as measured by crsfs , and also near the @xmath53 g peak in the distribution of radio pulsar fields @xcite .",
    "this implies that there is nothing unusual about the magnetic field strength of 4u  0352 + 309 .",
    "it is often useful to discuss the magnetic dipole moment @xmath54 of the neutron star since the magnetic field strength is a strong function of position . for a purely dipolar field ,",
    "the dipole moment is given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the magnetic field strength at the polar cap and @xmath57 the radius of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "so , for a polar cap field of 3.3@xmath58 g , the magnetic dipole moment of 4u  0352 + 309 is 1.7@xmath59@xmath60 .    in our two component continuum",
    ", we identify the power - law as the normal accreting pulsar continuum shape in the low accretion rate limit .",
    "while the spectrum of most accreting pulsars are exponentially cutoff above a characteristic energy @xmath36@xcite , our fits of 4u  0352 + 309 did not strongly require such a cutoff .",
    "when we substituted a plcut  for the simple power - law in our model ( see   [ sec : specfit ] ) , the cutoff and folding energies were @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively , with an f - test chance probability of 6@xmath63 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite when fitting _ _",
    "beppo__sax  data : @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    ". however , when we used the slightly different fdco , the cutoff and folding energies were completely unconstrained . because of the large errors and model dependence , we find there is at most weak evidence for an exponential cutoff in our spectrum of 4u  0352 + 309 .    assuming that the bulk motion of the electrons is small , as might be the case below an accretion shock @xcite , then the power - law component could be a comptonized spectrum due to the electrons in the accretion column . in the case of 4u  0352 + 309 the low accretion rate would lead to less efficient cooling of the infalling electrons , and therefore a higher electron temperature @xcite . in this model",
    "the exponential cutoff is at the electron temperature @xcite , which could explain the high energy ( @xmath66kev ) of any roll over in the spectrum : the temperature of the infalling electrons has increased the cutoff energy to beyond our sensitive detection band . using the the photon index @xmath35  and cutoff energy @xmath36 , the electron scattering depth @xmath67",
    "can be estimated @xcite .",
    "for an index of @xmath68 and a 60kev cutoff , the optical depth to electron scattering is @xmath69 .",
    "these hotter electrons can also account for the broad width of the crsf .",
    "it is thought that line widths are due , at least in part , to thermal doppler broadening by the electrons @xcite . because the motion of the electrons responsible for the scattering is quantized perpendicular to the field lines but free parallel to them , the width of the line should increase as the viewing angle approaches the field direction .",
    "@xcite predict that the width should go as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the electron temperature , @xmath72 is the electron rest mass , and @xmath73 is the viewing angle with respect to the field .",
    "if we assume that the electron temperature is @xmath66kev ( as indicated by the cutoff energy ) , then the crsf  width is @xmath74 .",
    "@xcite estimate the inclination angle of the system to be @xmath75 , so if the magnetic and spin axes are not greatly offset then @xmath76 .",
    "therefore the width of the crsf , while being quite wide , is roughly consistent with the estimates of the infalling electron temperature and viewing geometry .",
    "the value of @xmath77@xmath60  for the dipole moment derived from the crsf  is very different from what is estimated from accretion torque theory if the pulsar is spinning in equilibrium with the inner edge of an accretion disk @xcite . in the case of 4u  0352 + 309 , with 837s spin period and 4.2@xmath22@xmath2  luminosity , the implied magnetic dipole moment is @xmath784.1@xmath79@xmath60  ( depending on the model used for the magnetospheric radius ) , or at least 24 times larger than what we measure . using the observed luminosity and magnetic field strength , accretion torque theory predicts the equilibrium spin period to be in the range 2050s .",
    "however , instead of spinning up to this period the general trend is currently towards spinning down ( although it has been measured only infrequently , * ? ? ?",
    "one explanation for this is to assume that the star is _ not _ currently spinning in equilibrium with an accretion disk .",
    "indeed , it is unlikely that a persistent accretion disk is even present in this system . for a disk to form ,",
    "the radius at which the captured wind material would go into a keplerian orbit should be larger than the magnetospheric radius @xcite . for typical wind velocities ( @xmath80 km s@xmath13 ) and wide binary separations ( @xmath81days )",
    ", a disk will be unable to form .",
    "instead the accretion is quasi - spherical beyond the magnetospheric radius , while inside the behavior of matter is governed by the magnetic field .",
    "therefore accretion torque theory does not apply in the case of 4u  0352 + 309 , and there is no discrepancy between the magnetic field strength and pulse period .",
    "we have discovered a cyclotron resonant scattering feature at 29kev in the spectrum of 4u  0352 + 309 .",
    "the feature is strongest in the peak and falling edge of the pulsed emission , but also evident in the phase average spectrum .",
    "the crsf  energy implies a magnetic field strength at the polar cap of @xmath52 g .",
    "4u  0352 + 309 is also the lowest luminosity pulsar in which a crsfhas been observed .",
    "we have fit the continuum spectrum with a combination of a black body plus a power - law .",
    "both of the components exist in the on - pulse minus off - pulse spectra , showing that they are indeed coming from the pulsar magnetic polar cap .",
    "the inferred area of the soft component is @xmath41@xmath42 , consistent with being emission from the magnetic polar cap of the pulsar .",
    "the power - law component , although being quantitatively different than other , more luminous accreting x - ray  pulsars , is at least qualitatively similar .",
    "the main differences are a steeper photon index ( @xmath82 ) and the apparent lack of an exponential cutoff .",
    "we find that accretion torque theory does not fit the values of luminosity , spin period , and magnetic field strength , implying that the pulsar is not spinning in equilibrium with an accretion disk .",
