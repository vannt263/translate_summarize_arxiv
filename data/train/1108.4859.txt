    "the lyapunov functional used is a superposition of two copies  one for each soliton  of the classical functional , built from energy , momentum and mass , employed by weinstein @xcite to prove orbital stability of single solitons .",
    "this superposition was previously used by martel - merle - tsai @xcite in their study of the orbital stability of spreading multiple solitons .",

    "roughly , we prove that if @xmath127 is a ( densely defined ) functional such that the derivative is of order @xmath128 on @xmath129 , and if we define @xmath130 to be the quadratic part of @xmath131 above @xmath129 , then @xmath132 is essentially the quadratic part of the poisson bracket @xmath133 above @xmath129 , which we show is of order @xmath134 .",
    "let us note that @xmath135 losses occur in several estimates , which were not necessarily indicated in the above introduction , owing to the fact that in the attractive case @xmath136 can exceed @xmath137 by a factor of @xmath138 and @xmath139 decreases below @xmath140 , as well as the presence of an @xmath141-multiplication factor in terms involving @xmath142 in both the attractive and repulsive cases .",
    "we indicate the presence of such losses by writing , for example , @xmath143 .",
    "these losses are more carefully quantified in the concluding summary of the proof in  [ s : conclusion ] .",
    "we emphasize that the methods in  [ s : eff - dyn ] and  [ s : lyapunov ] , although stated only for the problem at hand , are fairly general and widely applicable to problems in orbital stability of single @xcite and multiple @xcite solitons and the dynamics of solitons in slowly varying potentials @xcite , weak rough potentials @xcite , and the interaction of two soliton tails , as considered here . the portion of the analysis most specific to the problem at hand appears in ",
    "[ s : approx - sol ] , where the approximate solution is constructed . in this section ,",
    "we consider the two components of the double - soliton separately and exploit the group structure of each individual soliton to pull - back to a nearly - stationary problem , which can be solved by operator inversion .",
    "this method was introduced by holmer - zworski @xcite to produce an improvement of the result by frhlich - gustafson - jonsson - sigal @xcite on the dynamics of single solitons in a slowly - varying potential , eliminating the uncontrollable errors in the odes appearing in @xcite .",
    "let us point out some related papers .",
    "marzuola - weinstein @xcite consider the dynamics of symmetric and antisymmetric states in a double well - potential .",
    "krieger - martel - raphal @xcite construct two - soliton solutions with separating components asymptotically as @xmath144 for the nonlinear hartree equation , where the long - range effects of the nonlinearity complicate the analysis but also lead to nonnegligible perturbations of the asymptotic trajectories .",
    "our analysis is similar in several ways to that of @xcite , although our priorties are different  we study the dynamics for a finite ( but dynamically significant ) time of an initial data that is close to a double - soliton , wheras they provide infinite time dynamics for an exact double - soliton solution .",
    "the problem of stability of nonintegrable nls multiple solitons , with components that separate as @xmath145 , has been considered by perelman @xcite , rodnianski - soffer - schlag @xcite , and martel - merle - tsai @xcite",
    ".    we now remark on where we rely upon the even / odd symmetry assumption on the solution . while the arguments in  [ s : eff - dyn ] yielding apply in general , in  [ s : approx - sol ] , when constructing the solution @xmath124 to the approximate equation , we do make use of the symmetry assumption , although we have sketched an argument ( not included in this paper ) showing how one can adapt the argument to the general case .",
    "the symmetry assumption also greatly simplifies the computations carried out in appendix a which ultimately yield the odes , , in theorem [ t : main1 ] .",
    "the integrals in the general case appear very complicated , and we are less confident that we could control the propagation of @xmath92 errors , as previously remarked .",
    "however , the one place where the symmetry assumption is used critically is in obtaining the _ upper _ bound on the lyapunov function used in  [ s : lyapunov ] to show the closeness of the true solution @xmath12 and the solution @xmath124 of the approximate equation .",
    "our guess is that to resolve this issue , one would need to restructure the martel - merle - tsai lyapunov function in a substantial way .",
    "the lower bound on the lyapunov function , however , carries through in general .",
