    "scattering of particles are present in many physical processes in a broad area of physics , as atomic ( e.g.  @xcite ) , plasma ( e.g.  @xcite ) , astrophysics ( e.g.  @xcite ) , active matter ( e.g.  @xcite ) , etc .",
    "a seminal paper was published by ernest rutherford in 1911 @xcite , in which he studied the deflection of @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles by an atom .",
    "he calculated analytically the angle of deflection of the ( positively charged ) incident particles with the ( charged ) nucleus .",
    "his calculations , compared to experimental data ( see @xcite for references ) , permitted to conclude that the atom is basically `` empty '' with a charge concentrated in the center , surrounded by the electron cloud , which lead to the `` planetary '' model of the atom .",
    "these two - body collisions plays also a central role in the collisional relaxation of coulomb plasmas ( see e.g. @xcite ) and self - gravitating systems ( or more generally of systems of particles with long range interactions ) , as pointed out by chandrasekhar in a seminal paper @xcite .",
    "when studying the relaxation of system of particles interacting with generalized power - law interaction ( see e.g. @xcite ) , it is necessary to generalize the chandrasekhar approach .",
    "this paper is devoted to the rigorous mathematical study of the generalization of the classical scattering of two particles interacting with the generic power - law interaction [ pot - def ] v(r)=. such process is well known only on the qualitative level or in particular cases ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in the case of a pure repulsive interaction , the angle of deflection @xmath7 ( defined in fig .",
    "[ coll ] ) is always well defined for any value @xmath4 and impact factor @xmath8 ( see also fig .",
    "[ coll ] ) , and varies between @xmath9 ( the particle comes back in its original direction with opposite velocity ) and @xmath10 ( the trajectory of the particle suffers no perturbation ) . in the case of attractive interactions ,",
    "the angle of deflection varies in the interval @xmath11 . in this case",
    "two different situations arise : if @xmath12 , the angular momentum  which scales with the distance as @xmath13  produces an effective repulsive interaction ( the so - called centrifugal potential barrier ) which always dominates the potential for @xmath14 and the angle of deflection is finite for any @xmath8 .",
    "however , for @xmath15 , the attractive interaction is stronger at small distances than the centrifugal barrier and particles can crash for values of the impact factor smaller than a critical quantity . for impact factors larger than this critical one",
    ", particles can make an arbitrarily large number of revolutions one around the other .",
    "this phenomenon is called in the literature _ orbiting _ ( see e.g. @xcite for a general discussion ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider interacting potentials of the form with @xmath1 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath16 is positive for repulsive interactions and negative for attractive ones .",
    "analytical simple calculations are not possible except for some particular cases for integer @xmath4 in term of circular functions ( see @xcite ) . in the other cases , only asymptotic expansions can be performed .",
    "for this reason , we will derive the asymptotic expressions for the angle of deflection of the particles for the two limiting cases which are determined by the value of the impact factor @xmath8 ( defined in fig .",
    "[ coll ] ) : the regime of _ soft scattering _ , in which the trajectories of the particles are weakly perturbed , and the regime of _ strong scattering _ , in which the particles suffer a large deflection .",
    "moreover , we will study in detail the introduction of a regularization ( usually called _ softening _ in the astrophysical literature ) at small scales in the potential .",
    "this is of primarily interest when studying the relaxation in systems of particles with long range interaction , in which the effect of the regularization at small scales can play a key role ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we will review definitions and standard formulas of the interaction of two particles in a central force field . in the subsequent section , we will explain the analytically tractable @xmath17 ( coulomb or gravitational ) case .",
    "then , we will study mathematically the case @xmath18 .",
    "we will then first explain our general approach with the already known ( see e.g. @xcite ) _ soft scattering regime _ , for which we extend the domain of validity to arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "then , we will derive expressions for the _ hard scattering regime _",
    ", in which we will obtain different classes of solution as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "in the subsequent section we will explain the physical implications of the mathematical results , compare them with the exact numerical integration of the equation of motion and show typical trajectories for the different regimes .",
    "then , we will study how the trajectories change when introducing a regularization at small scales in the potential .",
    "we conclude the paper with a summary of the results , conclusions and perspectives .",
    "let us consider the scattering of two isolated particles .",
    "it is convenient to use the center of mass frame to transform the two - particle problem in a one - particle one .",
    "let us consider that particles have masses @xmath19 and @xmath20 and their position @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "we define their relative position as [ relative - vector ] = _ 1-_2 and fix the origin of the frame at the center of mass , i.e. , [ center - of - mass ] m_1_1+m_2_2=0 . the relation between the position of the particles in the center of mass frame @xmath23 and in the laboratory frame is , using eqs .   and : [ change_coord ] @xmath24 where we have defined the reduced mass m=.    in the center of mass frame , the collision occurs as depicted in fig .",
    "[ coll ] , in which appears the definition of the impact factor @xmath8 , the angle of closest approach @xmath25 and the angle of deflection @xmath7 , which is @xmath26 . in order to define the angles with the usual mathematical signs ,",
    "the incident particle comes from @xmath27 .",
    "this picture assumes that the two particles are far away from each other for @xmath28 and for @xmath29 .",
    "the angle @xmath25 can be calculated , as a function of the impact factor @xmath8 , using the classical formula @xcite [ phi ] ( b)=_r_min^ , where @xmath30 is the asymptotic velocity of the incident particle at @xmath27 ( @xmath31 ) .",
