    "reduced decompositions of permutations are classical objects in combinatorics that appear throughout the literature . following the work of rodica simion and frank schmidt in @xcite , the study of permutation patterns , particularly pattern avoidance , has become a frequently studied field as well .    in @xcite , sara billey , william jockusch , and richard stanley",
    "relate these two concepts , possibly for the first time .",
    "there they show that @xmath0-avoiding permutations are exactly those permutations where the subsequence @xmath1 never occurs in a reduced decomposition .",
    "relatedly , victor reiner shows in @xcite that the number of @xmath2 occurrences in reduced decompositions of the longest element in the symmetric group , which has the maximal number of occurrences of @xmath0 , is equal to the number of such reduced decompositions .",
    "stanley had previously shown that this is the number of standard young tableaux of a staircase shape in @xcite .    inspired by these results , and more generally by the relationship they suggest between the two aspects of permutations , this paper studies elements of the symmetric group from the combined perspectives of their reduced decompositions and their patterns .",
    "while these aspects of a permutation appear extensively in combinatorial literature , they are not often treated together .",
    "this paper strives to remedy that fact , addressing several questions where reduced decompositions and permutation patterns together lead to interesting results .    after introducing basic terminology and notation in section  [ section defs ] , section  [ section vexillary ]",
    "generalizes the result of billey , jockusch , and stanley , via a new characterization of vexillary permutations in theorem  [ vexthm ] .",
    "this characterization is based on the reduced decompositions of the permutations _ containing _ the permutation in question , and is strikingly different from all previous equivalent characterizations .",
    "in addition to requiring that each of the permutations containing the vexillary permutation has a certain kind of reduced decomposition , the proof of theorem  [ vexthm ] explicitly constructs such a reduced decomposition .",
    "there are three algorithms which appear in this paper , the first of which occurs in the proof of theorem  [ vexthm ] .",
    "it should be noted that these are not deterministic , and include a certain amount of choice .",
    "for instance , example  [ vex ex ] describes only one possible route that the algorithm may take on a particular input .",
    "there is an equivalence relation , sometimes known as the commutation relation , on the set of reduced decompositions of a particular permutation .",
    "this and an associated graph are discussed in section  [ section eq ] .",
    "theorem  [ 1 lbm ] and corollary  [ 1 ulbm ] characterize permutations with graphs and commutation classes having certain properties .",
    "these results are strengthened in theorem  [ chainthm ] .    the results in sections  [ section polygon ] and [ section poset ] discuss permutation patterns with respect to a polygon defined by serge elnitsky in @xcite .",
    "the rhombic tilings of this polygon are in bijection with the commutation classes of a permutation .",
    "new results include that the number of commutation classes of a permutation is monotonically increasing with respect to pattern containment ( theorem  [ monotone ] ) , and several results pertaining to a poset associated with tilings of the polygon . finally , section  [ section fb ] completely describes this poset in the case of a freely braided permutation , as defined by richard green and jozsef losonczy in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main definitions and notation that appear throughout the paper are discussed below . for more information about these objects , including proofs of elementary facts , see @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the symmetric group @xmath3 is the coxeter group of type @xmath18 , and it is generated by the adjacent transpositions @xmath19 .",
    "the adjacent transpositions satisfy the coxeter relations : @xmath20    equation   is called the _ short braid relation _ , and equation   is the _ long braid relation_. a map is written to the left of its input , so @xmath21 interchanges the positions of values @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the permutation @xmath22 , while @xmath23 interchanges the values in positions @xmath16 and @xmath17 in @xmath22 .",

    "[ max elt ] the poset @xmath385 has a @xmath396 if and only if @xmath22 is @xmath397- , @xmath249- , and @xmath250-avoiding .    the definition of the poset @xmath385 and theorem  [ 2k - gon ] indicate that @xmath385 has a @xmath396 if and only if the union of any two decreasing subsequences that intersect at least twice is itself a decreasing subsequence .",
    "suppose there are decreasing subsequences in @xmath22 of lengths @xmath398 that intersect @xmath399 times , for @xmath400 .",
    "let @xmath401 , and choose a @xmath275 element subsequence of @xmath402 that includes @xmath403 and one more element from each descending subsequence .",

    "the permutation @xmath46 is always vexillary , so theorem  [ vexthm ] implies that @xmath385 will not have a @xmath396 if @xmath22 contains such a @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , considering the permutation @xmath46 for each possible @xmath407 , the poset @xmath385 has a @xmath396 if and only if @xmath22 is @xmath397- , @xmath249- , and @xmath250-avoiding .",

    "if a permutation @xmath22 is freely braided with @xmath234 distinct @xmath0-patterns , then there exists @xmath203 with @xmath234 disjoint long braid moves .",
    "[ fb tiles ] this means that there is a tiling of @xmath278 with @xmath234 sub - hexagons , none of which overlap .",
