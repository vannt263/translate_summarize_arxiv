    "the search for exotic phases of correlated quantum systems have become one of the most promising  but also very challenging  topic within condensed matter theory .",
    "it is believed that the interplay of strong quantum fluctuations and frustrated interactions plays the most important role in stabilizing such unconvential phases . however , the most common quantum phases in condensed matter physics display spontaneous symmetry breaking and long - range order .",
    "exotic phases are then often close in parameter space to these ordered phases and it is a notable challenge and an important task to develop strategies and tools allowing to extract quantitative information of such more conventional phases in order to characterize real systems and to guide experiments toward more exotic phases .",
    "a perfect microscopic test bed for this question is the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model at zero temperature in two dimensions , since it is expected to display various ordered and disordered ground states depending on the degree of geometric frustration and on the value of the total spin . at the same time it is the relevant microscopic description for many experiments .",
    "important examples are the unfrustrated spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the square lattice which shows long - range nel order  @xcite as well as the same model on the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice which has been studied extensively over the last decades and exhibits a three - sublattice @xmath0 ordered ground state  @xcite . in both cases",
    "the su(2 ) symmetry is spontaneously broken and one has gapless spin - wave exitations according to the goldstone theorem  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , on the highly frustrated kagome lattice , the spin-1/2 heisenberg model is believed to realize a quantum spin liquid ground state with exotic topological order @xcite while the ground state of the spin-@xmath1 cousin is most likely a spontaneous trimerized phase with long - range singlet order  @xcite and gapped excitations . for larger spins @xmath2 ,",
    "the ground - state of the heisenberg model on the kagome lattice is again magnetically ordered  @xcite .",
    "numerically , there are several techniques which can be applied to two - dimensional quantum many - body systems which all have strengths as well as complications .",
    "one promising tool which is under active development in recent years are so - called non - perturbative linked - cluster expansions ( nlces)@xcite , which are non - perturbative variants of perturbative linked - cluster expansions ( lces ) where high - order series expansions ( se ) are derived in the thermodynamic limit using a full - graph decomposition and the linked - cluster theorem . in ,",
    "perturbation theory on graphs is replaced by non - perturbative tools like exact diagonalization ( ed ) , density matrix renormalization group  @xcite or continuous unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "all current nlces are real - space approaches . as a consequence ,",
    "one expects convergence in gapped quantum phases due to the finite correlation length and complications for gapless systems .",
    "however , as shown recently @xcite , even in gapped phases like the trimerized phase of the spin-@xmath1 heisenberg model on the kagome lattice , the nlce data sequences can become erratic due to peculiar quantum criticalities of lower - dimensional subsets of graphs . here the trimerized order of the two - dimensional system is not reflected in the calculation on one - dimensional graphs leading to the wrong assignment of fluctuations which are not present in the two - dimensional system .",
    "it is therefore necessary to extend the nlces in such a way that each cluster `` remembers '' the quantum order out of which it is taken from . for the ordered phase of the transverse - field ising model on the square lattice",
    "this has been already realized successfully in ref .  .",
    "in this work we present an extended scheme which also realizes this line of reasoning .",
    "we consider clusters to be taken out of a long - range ordered reference state .",
    "this state can either be a classical spin - ordered configuration like the nel state or a valence bond solid breaking translational symmetry like a trimerized state .",
    "these reference states introduce symmetry - breaking edge - fields in the ed of clusters which enable us to perform nlces in gapped and gapless ordered quantum phases .",
    "we test our scheme on various lattices using either quantum spins 1/2 or 1 .    this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sect : nlce ] we explain briefly the main idea behind nlces .",
    "the edge - field nlce for ordered quantum systems is introduced in sect .",
    "[ sect : models ] and the tested scaling behaviors of nlce data is given in sect .",
    "[ sect : scaling ] , followed by the results for the spin-@xmath3 and spin-@xmath1 heisenberg models on the square and triangular lattice in sections  [ sect : results : squareonehalf ] to  [ sect : results : triangularone ] displaying long - range magnetic order . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sect : spin1kagome ] , the edge - field approach is applied to the trimerized and gapped spin-@xmath1 kagome heisenberg model . the paper concludes with a brief summary of the main results .",
    "the essential idea of nlces is to exploit the linked - cluster theorem so that actual numerical calculations are done on finite linked clusters , but the final results are valid directly in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "generically , nlces consist of three steps : i ) choosing and generating the families of clusters or topologically distinct graphs used in the lce , ii ) performing numerical calculations on graphs extracting the physical quantities of interest , and iii ) determining the reduced contributions specific to each graph and embed these contributions into the infinite lattice .",
    "the details of the choice of graphs ( i ) will be given below .",
    "concerning ii ) , we are using ed with the lanczos algorithm  @xcite to determine the ground - state energy @xmath4 ( as well as the sublattice magnetization for spin - ordered phases ) on each graph . apart from the exponential increase of graphs with the number of sites @xmath5 ,",
    "the memory needed for ed is the limiting factor of nlces .    in the third step iii ) we concentrate on the ground - state energy per site @xmath6 and the appropriate order parameter in the thermodynamic limit , e.g.  the sublattice magnetization in long - range spin - ordered phases .",
    "in this technical part we only discuss @xmath6 which can be expressed as @xmath7 where the sum runs over all linked graphs @xmath8 .",
    "the integer number @xmath9 is the so - called embedding factor specifying the combinatorical number how often graph @xmath8 can be embedded into the infinite lattice .",
    "the reduced contribution @xmath10 specific to graph @xmath8 results from subtracting all contributions of subgraphs in order to avoid double counting .",
    "one has @xmath11 note thate the sum runs over all connected subgraphs of @xmath8 without identifying topologically equivalent contributions . depending on the lattice , different resummation schemes could be useful . here",
    "we apply the following four different expansions :      in the full - graph expansion all topological distinct graphs with up to @xmath5 ( effective ) sites are generated .",
    "we define the order of the expansion as the maximum number of sites @xmath5 taken into account .",
    "note that the sites can be either single spins or a collection of spins like dimers or trimers which function then as effective sites for the graph expansion . in this scheme",
    "the number of graphs grows quickly with the order but the hilbert spaces for ed are typically small for the considered @xmath5 . at the same time it seems impossible to assign typical length scales to graphs which complicates a scaling towards the infinite - order limit .",
    "in contrast to the full - graph expansion where the number of graphs grows very quickly , the rectangular - graph expansion  @xcite is restricted to graphs which are rectangular with linear dimensions @xmath12 and @xmath13 so that .",
    "the number of this type of graphs grows much less fast with the number of sites @xmath5 . at the same time the subtraction and",
    "embedding procedure becomes trivial for rectangular graphs .",
    "the rectangular - graph expansion is by construction especially useful for the square lattice , since rectangular graphs respect the space - symmetries of this lattice .",
    "the order is still defined as the number of sites @xmath5 , but now the limiting factor is not the number of graphs , but the ed .",
    "in contrast to the full - graph expansion , as shown in ref .  , it is possible to introduce the typical length scale @xmath14 for each order which allows scalings to the infinite - order limit .",
    "however , as we detail below , this scaling is still complicated , since the behavior of the rectangular - graph expansion is not smooth with the nlce order .",
    "another scheme , which we call arithmetic expansion , uses again only rectangular graphs , but defines the order as the spatial dimension along the diagonal in a manhattan - distance sense .",
    "the order of an @xmath15 rectangular graph is then defined as @xmath16 . the @xmath17 is chosen , so that the smallest graph , which is a single two - site chain segment , has the order @xmath1",
    ". therefore the arithmetic order counts the number of links along two of the edges .    for all scalings to the infinite - order limit",
    "we introduce the length scale @xmath18 for the arithmetic expansion .",
    "since the number of sites is not the same for each graph within each order of the arithmetic expansion , we use @xmath19 for all scalings , since this corresponds to the average linear extension of the largest quadratic graph in each nlce order .",
    "as we will see below , only even nlce orders are taken into account in the scalings and therefore @xmath18 is an integer number .      within the rectangular - graph expansion the graphs with the largest spatial extension in one direction are very long chain graphs",
    "this can become problematic for two - dimensional systems , since these one - dimensional graphs might direct the nlce in the wrong direction .",
    "the arithmetic expansion corrects this to a certain extent . here",
    "the maximal chain graph in a given order has the same length as the manhattan distance of the more quadratic graphs .",
    "the square - graph expansion goes one step further . here",
    "the order is defined as the maximum number @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 ) of sites into one direction of the rectangular graphs . in order to perform a valid graph expansion all subgraphs of the largest graph",
    "must also be taken into account . as a consequence ,",
    "there are still chain graphs contained in the square - graph expansion , but their length will never be greater than the length of the largest quadratic graph .    again , as in the arithmetic expansion , the number of sites is not the same for each graph in the expansion .",
    "but now it is clear that the quadratic graph with @xmath20 sites has the maximum number of sites in a given order .",
    "therefore we use @xmath21 as the appropriate length scale for the square - graph expansion when performing scalings to the infinite - order limit .",
    "one problem within nlces is , that the graphs themself are not `` aware '' of the ordered ground state on the infinite lattice .",
    "while the full symmetries of the lattice are restored through the embedding process , single graphs ( or subsets of graphs ) could show an entirely different behavior compared to the physics of the full lattice , as it has been shown in ref .   for the spin-@xmath1 kagome antiferromagnet .",
    "there one - dimensional subsets of graphs behave differently , since the one - dimensional subsystem undergoes a different quantum phase transition in a relevant parameter regime .",
    "this situation can be expected generically in quantum many - body systems , especially in the presence of geometric frustration where many different phases compete with each other . as a consequence",
    ", it can happen that any partial finite nlce order displays an erratic behavior and the nlce essentially breaks down .    to overcome this issue we want to incorporate the following line of reasoning .",
    "the nlce is intended to expand non - perturbatively about the expected quantum phase of a given model which in our case is two - dimensional and long - range ordered .",
    "each graph treated in the nlce should then contribute the fluctuations specfic to this graph _ being part _ of the ordered phase for the physical quantities of interest , e.g.  the ground - state energy per site .",
    "this is only possible if in the calculation on graphs one includes the couplings to the expected ordered state _",
    "outside _ the graph .    in practice , we assume that the hamiltonian can be expressed in the following form @xmath22 so that @xmath23 has a symmetry broken ground state which is a product state and is adiabatically connected to the ordered quantum phase expected to be present at finite values of @xmath24 ( often @xmath25 is targeted ) .",
    "let us mention that the parameter @xmath24 might be already part of the original model under study or is introduced `` by hand '' corresponding to a deformation of the hamiltonian to the desired form .    for the nlce , the elementary site",
    "is then chosen according to the product - state structure of @xmath23 .",
    "the graphs @xmath26 are considered to be surrounded by the state @xmath27 .",
    "all couplings between a site @xmath28 of @xmath26 and a site @xmath29 outside @xmath26 are called the `` edge - couplings '' @xmath30 of @xmath26 .",
    "these edge - couplings are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : edgefieldlattice ] for a particular graph on the square lattice .",
    "all couplings within the graph are treated as usual during the ed . however , the operator @xmath30 of an edge - coupling reduces to the edge - field @xmath31 on site @xmath28 of @xmath26 . as a consequence",
    ", the correct symmetry - breaking is incorporated inside the nlce scheme .",
    "the strength of the total edge - field influencing the results on a graph scales with the perimeter of the graph . as a result ,",
    "the influence on one - dimensional chain graphs is maximal while it is minimal on the most two - dimensional graphs .",
    "this is exactly inline with the above reasoning .",
    "let us stress that due to the subtraction and embedding procedure within nlce the impact of edge - fields becomes less and less for increasing graph sizes , since the size of the bulk of a graph scales much faster with the number of sites @xmath5 ( again , one - dimensional chain graphs are special ) .",
    "in practice , however , the treated graphs are typically not in this limit .",
    "we therefore introduce the parameter @xmath32 so that the edge - field @xmath33 can be tuned in a flexible fashion .",
    "physically , a value @xmath34 corresponds to a different mean - field product state @xmath35 . in the limit @xmath36",
    "the edge - field is so strong that no fluctuations take place on graphs and the system remains in the product state @xmath27 of @xmath23 . in the opposite limit @xmath37 , the standard nlce without edge - fields",
    "is recovered with the above mentioned problems . in practice ,",
    "one expects @xmath38 , since the true ground state of @xmath39 contains quantum fluctuations giving smaller values compared to @xmath40 .",
    "it is important to note , that the contribution of these edge - fields must be subtracted from the ground - state energy within the nlce .",
    "additionally , as the clusters are getting bigger the contribution of the edge - fields is getting smaller since they are only present at the boundary of the graphs .",
    "therefore the edge - field contribution to the ground - state energy is sub - extensive .    in this work",
    "we consider two types of ordered phases which we treat with the edge - field nlce .",
    "the first class are magnetically ordered phases .",
    "the quantum ground state can then be considered as a dressed version of the associated classical order , both having the same kind of order parameter corresponding to a finite sublattice magnetization . in this case",
    "one can always perform an appropriate sublattice rotation so that the classically ordered state is given by the perfect polarized state where all spins point in @xmath41-direction . after the sublattice rotation and assuming two - site interactions ( a generalization is straightforward ) , the hamiltonian",
    "can then be written as @xmath42 which is of the desired form eq .   with the edge - field",
    "is therefore a local magnetic field operator on the sites @xmath28 of the edge of any graph @xmath43    the second class of quantum phases are non - magnetic valence bond solids ( vbs ) which break the translational symmetry of the system . in the most common form",
    "the system dimerizes , i.e.  pairs of spins form dimers which themselves order on the lattice .",
    "a generalization of this is a trimerization which is important for the spin-@xmath1 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the kagome lattice .",
    "@xcite here three spins on a triangle build a low - energy singlet state and it is the trimer entity which is the elementary building block of the ordered state . in both cases ( dimerization and trimerization )",
    "it is always possible to introduce a parameter @xmath24 so that for @xmath44 one gets a hamiltonian @xmath23 having a ground state of decoupled singlet dimers or trimers .",
    "therefore , the elementary `` sites '' in the nlce are chosen to be these dimers or trimers .",
    "in contrast to the edge - field nlce in the spin - ordered phases described above , the hamiltonian @xmath23 is completely local in terms of sites . as a consequence ,",
    "there are no edge - couplings of the form @xmath30 for @xmath44 . in this case",
    "it is mandatory to consider the limit of infinitely small @xmath24 where edge - couplings appear naturally in second - order perturbation theory in @xmath24 of the form @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the singlet projector on dimer or trimer @xmath28 at the edge of a given graph .",
    "the edge - fields in the nlce are then given by @xmath47        the implementation of edge - fields is now straightforward : we only take `` strong '' graphs  @xcite into account .",
    "`` strong '' graphs are graphs where all possible couplings between the sites are set .",
    "this is necessary to make the edge - field configuration unique for each graph and not embedding - dependent . for each graph",
    "the outgoing couplings of site @xmath28 then lead to the above defined edge - fields .",
    "the next step involves the calculation of extensive ground - state quantities ( e.g.  the energy or the sublattice magnetization ) via ed . in the last step",
    "the considered quantities are reduced and embedded onto the infinite lattice .",
    "remember , that it is important to subtract the edge - field contributions from the ground - state energy .",
    "for example , if the reference state is the polarized ferromagnet the subtraction is quite easy , since each edge - coupling leads to a subtraction of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the spin of a single site .",
    "this can be seen as a subtraction of single - site contributions , because the edge - fields are local terms which act only on single sites .",
    "the question that remains is , what is the `` optimal '' value of the edge - field strength @xmath50 ?",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    ", in this work we apply the following two different schemes : i ) the first is based on a self - consistent solution for the order parameter , e.g.  the sublattice magnetization for the spin - ordered phases .",
    "ii ) the second targets @xmath50-values with a minimal sensitivity with respect to the ground - state energy .",
    "\\i ) physically , it is reasonable to assume that a good choice for @xmath50 is of the order of the true order parameter of the quantum phase . and",
    "indeed , we find that one obtains very good results if @xmath50 is determined self - consistently as the value of the sublattice magnetization @xmath51 for the spin - ordered phases .",
    "we will call this scheme the fixpoint - method ( abbreviated by `` fix '' ) , since we are looking for the fixpoint @xmath52 .    to find this fixpoint we use the secant - method of root finding for each nlce order , i.e.  for a fixed order we choose two starting values @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for both @xmath50-values",
    "we calculate the sublattice magnetization of all graphs which contribute to this nlce order",
    ". then we subtract and embed them according to the linked - cluster theorem to obtain the values @xmath55 of the sublattice magnetization . in the final step the secant - method",
    "is used to construct an improved choice of @xmath50 . in the iteration",
    "one has @xmath56 from which we calculate the corresponding @xmath57 . we stop this iterative process if @xmath58 .",
    "\\ii ) the second approach to determine a proper @xmath50 is to use the criterium of minimal sensitivity with respect to the ground - state energy per site .",
    "physically , this is based on the observation that the effect of @xmath50 reduces for increasing graph sizes , since it is a subextensive quantity .",
    "so in principle the nlce should converge for each value of @xmath50 in the limit of large graphs . as a consequence",
    ", it makes sense to choose the @xmath50 in each nlce order so that the ground - state energy per site depends only minimally on @xmath50 .",
    "we therefore check in each nlce order for a local minimum in the function @xmath59 . at this minimum",
    "the variation with respect to @xmath50 is minimal .",
    "note that there exist nlce orders which do not display a local minimum . in this case case",
    "we discard this nlce order for any further extrapolation to the infinite - order limit .",
    "this scheme is called the minimum - method abbreviated by `` min '' .",
    "the nlce is performed directly in the thermodynamic limit , which is one important aspect compared to other numerical tools .",
    "therefore there are no finite - size effects but each nlce order corresponds to a different truncation of the real - space fluctuations in the infinite system .",
    "nevertheless , one is interested in a proper scaling of the nlce data towards the infinite - order limit .",
    "such scalings of nlces are a challenging task and a priori no scaling laws are known for nlces to the best of our knowledge . in this section",
    "we list two different scaling behaviors which we test below : ( i ) the first is known from conventional finite - size scaling of gapless spin - ordered heisenberg models @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the second stems heuristically from the coupled - cluster method ( ccm ) @xcite which is , similar to nlces , a tool which works directly in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "\\(i ) if we consider a long - range ordered antiferromagnetic ground state in two dimensions with gapless spin - wave excitations , then the finite - size scaling for the ground - state energy per site @xmath6 and the sublattice magnetization @xmath51 is given by @xcite @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the linear length of the considered finite system , @xmath62 are fitting parameters , and @xmath63 denotes higher - order terms in @xmath64 .",
    "\\(ii ) in ccm , the following heuristic scaling laws have been deduced @xcite @xmath65 which allows an optimal scaling of ccm data obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit . here",
    "@xmath66 are fitting parameters , and @xmath63 denotes again higher powers in @xmath64 .    in the following",
    "we will test these scaling laws of type ( i ) and ( ii ) for the edge - field nlce data squences by identifying the length scale @xmath61 with the typical length scales @xmath67 , @xmath18 , and @xmath68 of the different nlces .",
    "in the following we present the results obtained by our edge - field nlce for various models and lattices .",
    "we start by benchmarking our approach for the nel - ordered ground state of the spin-1/2 heisenberg square lattice , which is well - studied and allows us to identify the optimal set ups concerning the type of cluster expansion and the choice of the edge - field @xmath50 .",
    "afterwards , we concentrate on the optimal set ups and discuss the results for the other considered systems .      the spin-@xmath3 heisenberg model on the square lattice is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is chosen antiferromagnetic and the sum runs over all pairs of nearest neighbors .",
    "the zero - temperature ground state is the long - range ordered nel state @xcite which represents a true challenge for any real - space approach due to the infinite correlation length and the gapless spin - wave excitations . on the other side",
    "the system is geometrically unfrustrated which is expected to help for the convergence of the nlce .     for the spin-@xmath3 square lattice heisenberg model as a function of the edge - field @xmath50 using the ( a ) full - graph , ( b ) rectangular - graph , ( c ) arithmetic , ( d ) square - graph nlce .",
    "different symbols correspond to different nlce orders .",
    "the lines between symbols are guide to the eyes .",
    "the horizontal black line illustrates the qmc - value from ref .  .",
    "]    as in standard spin - wave calculations , we perform a sublattice rotation to obtain the following hamiltonian @xmath71 this form is well - suited for our edge - field nlce .",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath24 which interpolates between the ising ( @xmath44 ) and the heisenberg ( @xmath25 ) limit .",

    "the reference state is then chosen as one of the fully polarized ising ground states along the @xmath41-direction and the definition of the edge - fields   are straightforward .",
    "we focus first on the most challenging gapless case @xmath25 for the nlce .",
    "the simpler case of the gapped xxz - model for @xmath73 is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "we start the discussion with the ground - state energy per site @xmath6 and we use the value obtained by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations  @xcite @xmath74 to gauge our edge - field approach .",
    "note that the qmc value has been obtained by the scaling law of type ( i ) introduced in sect .",
    "[ sect : scaling ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlce_squareonehalf ] ( a ) we show the ground - state energy per site for the full - graph expansion up to @xmath75 sites as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "one clearly observes that the nlce diverges for small @xmath76 ( including zero ) , which already signals the importance to include the effects of the long - range order in the nlce .",
    "in contrary , large values of @xmath76 stabilize the expansion , as expected .",
    "if one compares the results to the qmc value , it can be seen that the edge - field nlce gets closer to the qmc - value with increasing order ( which equals to the number of sites @xmath5 for the full - graph expansion ) .",
    "still , the expansion is not yet well converged and for @xmath77 an odd - even effect is present .",
    "the curves of even order possess no optimal @xmath50-value , e.g.  no local minima exist .",
    "this is different for the odd orders where well - defined minima are present which can serve as the optimal @xmath50-values .",
    "next we turn to the results of the rectangular - graph expansion which are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlce_squareonehalf ] ( b ) .",
    "this expansion is much better converged , which , however , is mainly due to the larger number of sites included in the higher order clusters .",

    "if one takes a closer look at these minima in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlce_squareonehalf ] ( b ) , the minima converge well to the qmc - value .",
    "a problematic feature of the rectangular - graph expansion is a proper scaling or extrapolation in the order , which has already been observed in other nlce studies using rectangular graphs @xcite . since @xmath14 is used to define the typical length scale in the rectangular - graph expansion , energy `` plateaus '' are visible as can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : nlce_squareonehalf_scaling ] , i.e.  different orders have almost the same value for the energy and only at certain orders the value changes from one plateau to the one at lower energy .",
    "this behavior results due to the fact that certain orders , e.g.  12 and 13 , only differ in the contribution from one chain graph ( in the example the one with 13 sites ) which typically have a very small reduced contribution to the two - dimensional energy per site . as a consequence ,",
    "the extrapolation to the infinite - order limit is difficult for the rectangular - graph expansion .",
    "nevertheless , a scaling of type ( i ) ( see solid line in the inset of fig .  [",

    "an odd - even effect , as in the full - graph expansion , is again visible and minima as a function of @xmath50 exist only for the even orders in this expansion .",

    "in contrast , the edge - field nlce shows an almost constant difference to the ipeps values with constant bond dimension @xmath240 for @xmath242 $ ] which we attribute mostly to uncertainties in the scaling ( as well as to the finite @xmath243 ) . for @xmath25  corresponding to the isotropic heisenberg model on the kagome lattice  our best result from ref .   using a reorganized graph expansion",
    "was @xmath244 .",
    "the full - graph expansion with edge - fields yields the scaled value @xmath245 which is nearly within the error estimations of the value @xmath246 obtained by the ipeps calculations .",
    "furthermore it also compares well to the dmrg - value @xmath247 from ref .  .",
    "in this work we have presented a generic scheme to perform nlces in long - range ordered quantum phases .",
    "the essential idea is to incorporate the effect of the long - range order into the exact diagonalization on graphs .",
    "then each graph `` remembers '' the ordered quantum phase out of which it is taken from and the correct quantum fluctuations are captured in the nlce .",
    "this is achieved by assuming an appropriate ordered reference state outside each graph so that the edge - couplings give rise to an effective edge - field .",
    "the edge - field breaks the relevant symmetry , which corresponds to the underlying long - range order , and it ensures that the nlce is carried out for each graph inside the correct quantum phase .",
    "the field is subextensive , since it scales with the perimeter of the graphs . as a consequence ,",
    "the nlce is regularized and fluctuations from different quantum phases and different quantum critical behavior on lower - dimensional subgraphs are excluded .",
    "we have implemented four different nlces .",
    "the full - graph expansion as well as the rectangular - graph expansion are complicated to extrapolate to the infinite - order limit , since in the full - graph expansion no proper length scale can be defined while the nlce data squences are not smooth for different nlce orders in the rectangular - graph expansion .",
    "notably , we found heuristically for the full - graph expansion in the trimerized ground state of the spin-@xmath1 heisenberg model on the kagome lattice , that the nlce data sequence of the ground - state energy is approximately linear in @xmath248 .",
    "this suggests that scalings might be also valuable for nlces using a full - graph expansion .",
    "in contrast , both the arithmetic as well as the square - graph expansion give satisfactory results and scalings towards the infinite - order limit can be performed successfully .",
    "however , we have observed that the scaling is more complicated in the arithmetic expansion which can be traced back to the fact that different clusters of the same nlce order have almost the same typical length scale but different aspect ratios .",
    "this is different for the square - graph expansion where each order is clearly dominated by the length scale of the largest quadratic cluster . in this work",
    "we have also investigated two different scaling laws for the nlce data .",
    "although the quality of both scaling types is very similar ( especially for the ground - state energy per site ) .",
    "we are strongly convinced that it is an important but challenging task to formulate proper scaling laws for nlces from first principles .",
    "we have applied the edge - field nlce to the long - range spin - ordered phases of the spin-1/2 and spin-1 heisenberg model on the square and triangular lattice as well as to the trimerized valence bond crystal of the spin-1 heisenberg model on the kagome lattice . in all cases",
    "we have found that edge - fields are essential to obtain a well - behaved nlce for the ground - state energy per site and the sublattice magnetization .",
    "we have chosen the unfrustrated spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the square lattice to test four different cluster expansions and we formulated two strategies to determine the optimal value of the edge - field .",
    "it is found that all nlces compare reasonably well with state - of - the - art numerical qmc data .",
    "furthermore , the arithmetic and the square - graph expansion perform best and both approaches to determine the edge - field yield similarly good results .",
    "we find it interesting that the square - graph expansion works , in contrast to the arithmetic expansion , even better for the geometrically frustrated spin-1/2 triangular lattice compared to the unfrustrated square lattice in the sense that no even - odd effect is present and therefore scalings can be performed through more nlce data points",
    ". it would be nice if one could formulate a reorganized nlce with different elementary clusters which does not show this even - odd effect on the square lattice .",
    "overall , we are convinced that the edge - field nlce can be extended successfully into several directions which we hope to tackle in future works .",
    "first , it would be interesting to apply other numerical tools to extract quantitatively physical quantities for larger open clusters .",
    "this would allow to improve the quality of the infinite - order scaling considerably resulting in even better nlce results .",
    "second , one should apply the edge - field nlce to systems where several quantum phases compete with each other .",
    "a comparison of different nlce energies and their convergence behavior should allow the determination of the ground - state phase diagram .",
    "third , one might speculate whether a formulation of edge - field nlces can be achieved where the mean - field reference product state is replaced by more complex entangled tensor networks .",
    "this would open the fascinating perspective to tackle also exotic quantum disordered phases with nlces .",
