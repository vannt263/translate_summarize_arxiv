    "400  gev jets can be reached and thus the accurate separation of @xmath4 and @xmath5 hadronic decays will be possible . for optimal performance of this technique , calorimeters with very fine lateral and longitudinal segmentation must be employed .",
    "one of the proposed technology is a micromegas ( micro - mesh gaseous structure ) detector with 1  cm@xmath1 pads that are readout by embedded digital electronics processing only 1 or 2 bit information per channel .",
    "this concept , which is also called digital calorimetry , makes easier the construction of a high granular sampling hadron calorimeter with single shower imaging capability .",
    "feasibility of the concept will be validated by a performance test of a 1  m@xmath2 calorimeter prototype consisting of 40 layers , each equipped with 1  m@xmath1 large micromegas chamber , and having about 370,000 readout channels in total .",
    "main outputs of the r&d program towards the construction of this 1  m@xmath2 calorimeter prototype are described in what follows .",
    "several micromegas chambers have been produced so far by use of the bulk micromegas technique  @xcite .",
    "their size varies from @xmath7  cm@xmath1 up to @xmath8  cm@xmath1 .",
    "each chamber consists of a pcb with top conductive layer segmented into 1 cm@xmath1 anode pads , woven mesh supported by insulating pillars 128  @xmath9 m above the anode plane , 3  mm thick plastic frame which defines the drift region , and 2  mm thick grounded steel cover with a drift copper electrode glued on its internal side .",
    "gas distribution is provided by two holes for input and output in the plastic frame .",
    "a detailed description of the prototype design can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the first prototypes have been equipped with an analog readout which was intended mainly for chamber characterization and definition of necessary parameters for future prototypes with digital readout chips embedded on the external side of the chamber pcb .",
    "three 64-channel asics providing digital readout were designed : hardroc  @xcite , dirac  @xcite , and microroc  @xcite .",
    "they can operate in a power pulsing mode which is intended for matching the ilc beam time structure and therefore to reduce the power consumption down to 10@xmath9w / channel .",
    "the first two chips have been already used for prototype readout and their performance has been evaluated during test beam campaigns . a design of the last chip , which will equip future chambers , has been completed and its production has just started .",
    "fundamental characteristics of the prototype chambers , such as energy resolution , electron collection efficiency , gas gain and signal dependency on the environmental conditions , were measured at laboratory by use of an @xmath10fe x - ray source .",
    "the measurements were performed in ar / ic@xmath11h@xmath12 ( 95/5 ) and ar / co@xmath13 ( 80/20 ) gas mixtures and the signals from x - rays were processed by the analog readout .",
    "the energy resolution of the chamber @xmath14 was measured to be 7.5  % at 5.9  kev which corresponds to a fwhm of 17.6  % .",
    "the maximum electron collection efficiency is reached for an optimal ratio between amplification and drift electric field .",
    "it was measured that the maximum of the signal is obtained for the field ratio about 150200 for both gas mixtures . at this field ratio",
    ", the collection efficiency should be maximum .",
    "a maximum gas gain of @xmath15 and @xmath16 has been achieved in ar / ic@xmath11h@xmath12 ( 95/5 ) and ar / co@xmath13 ( 80/20 ) gas mixtures , respectively .",
    "in addition , the gas gain depends strongly on the amplification gap thickness .",
    "it is estimated from test beam data analysis that gap size irregularities are smaller than 3  @xmath9 m r.m.s .. finally , the sensitivity of the gas gain to the ambient variables were measured and quantified as @xmath17%/k@xmath18 and @xmath19%/mbar@xmath18 for temperature and atmospheric pressure , respectively .",
    "these values correspond well to ones predicted from a gas gain model  @xcite .      during the last years",
    "the chambers prototypes were tested in particle beams .",
    "the major objectives of these experiments were the functional test of new prototypes in real data taking condition and evaluation of the main chamber properties such as gain uniformity , detection efficiency and hit multiplicity , and study of the prototype response in hadronic and electromagnetic showers .",
    "the test beams were carried out at cern ps and sps lines where chambers were exposed to low momentum electrons of 2  gev / c and hadrons up to 10  gev / c as well as to high momentum muons and pions of 200  gev / c .",

    "three chambers with an active area of @xmath20  cm@xmath1 and one with @xmath21  cm@xmath1 , with analog readout were assembled in a stack placed perpendicularly to the beam .",
    "an electronics noise of 0.3  fc corresponding to 2000  @xmath22 was measured .",
    "the most probable value of the deposited charge is around 22  fc with a variation of 11.3  % over all 672 readout channels .",
    "relatively large dispersion in gain among the channels is mainly due to drift or / and amplification gap non - uniformity .",
    "a detection efficiency larger than 97  % was reached at 1.5  fc readout threshold in three of four chambers with an efficiency disparity of less than 1  % per channel .",
    "the last one had efficiency around 91  % as a consequence of a higher electronic noise .",
    "the efficiency is decreasing with increasing readout threshold as is shown in fig .",
    "[ efficiency ] .",
    "the hit multiplicity was measured to be between 1.06 to 1.1 at 1.5  fc readout threshold .",
    "its dependency on the threshold is displayed in fig .",
    "[ multiplicity ] , where the raised values of multiplicity above 50  fc are due to the hits from long range @xmath23-rays .    in order to verify that the prototypes also detect multi - hits events ,",
    "shower profiles have been measured with the @xmath21  cm@xmath1 chamber and a variable number of 2  cm thick stainless steel absorber plates placed in front of it .",
    "this configuration allows to measure lateral and longitudinal shower profiles and also , by applying a threshold on the recorded charge signals , to compare the deposited energy and number of hits in a chamber .",
    "an example of the measured longitudinal shower profile for 2  gev / c electrons and its comparison with geant4 monte carlo data is shown in fig .",

    "]      two stacks with embedded digital readout were assembled and exposed to 2  gev / c electrons .",
    "the first one consists of four chambers with @xmath24  cm@xmath1 pads read out by hardroc chips .",
    "a clear image of the beam profile has been seen in each chamber . because of the short shaping time of the hardroc chip , only little of the signal can be seen and , consequently , the measured efficiency is about 6  % .",
    "the second stack was assembled by four @xmath7  cm@xmath1 chambers with dirac chips .",
    "unfortunately , due to insufficient spark protection , the life - time of the dirac chips in a beam was limited .",
    "nevertheless , an efficiency up to 50% and a hit multiplicity between 1.06 and 1.13 have been measured .",
    "these results are affected by low statistics and therefore serve only as a first performance indication .",
    "that is why one of the main aim of the next generation readout electronics development is to obtain a reliable spark protection .",
    "an essential step towards the 1m@xmath2 technological prototype of dhcal , which will be made of 40 micromegas chambers with embedded readout electronics interleaved by stainless steel absorbers , is the construction and test of a 1m@xmath1 prototype , the largest micromegas chamber so far built .",
    "the chamber is formed by 6 active sensor units ( asu ) of 48@xmath2532 readout pads of 1cm@xmath1 , see fig .",
    "[ m2photo ] .",
    "each asu is equipped with a mesh and 24 hardroc readout chips .",
    "these asus are glued on a 2  mm thick stainless steel supporting plate and the chamber is closed by another 2  mm thick stainless steel plate that carries the cathode . in this arrangement , all the asus share the same gas volume .",
    "the drift gap is defined by a plastic frame around the chamber and spacers that are placed between the asus resulting in very small dead zones of around 1.6% .",
    "the gas distribution is provided by one inlet and outlet in the chamber frame .",
    "the readout of two asus is chained serially and connected to the data acquisition system by a detector interface board ( dif ) .",
    "the dif is a mezzanine board which allows to configure hardrocs by setting readout thresholds and preamplifier gains , to readout the hardorc data , and also to provide the distribution of the system clock and high voltages through another dedicated board , called inter - dif , which stands between the dif and the asu .",
    "the total active area of the complete 1m@xmath1 chamber is 96@xmath2596cm@xmath1 corresponding to 9216 readout channels .",
    "the channel signals are processed by 144 hardroc chips and three dif boards .",
    "the effective thickness of the chamber , if one does not count the 4 mm of the supporting plates material that can be considered as a part of the calorimeter absorber , is equal to 8 mm and complies well with the ilc specification .    a beam profile of 150  gev / c muons traversing the 1m@xmath1 micromegas chamber .",
    "]    a beam profile of 150  gev / c muons traversing the 1m@xmath1 micromegas chamber . ]",
    "prior to the 1m@xmath1 assembly , the electronics characteristics of the readout chips are measured and the overall asu functioning is verified in a test gas chamber .",
    "the electronics tests consist of the determination of the pedestals and noise level of each channel to achieve the lowest detection threshold , and the determination of the channel preamplifier gains .",
    "the determination of the pedestals and noise level is done by measuring the trigger efficiency of each channel as a function of threshold ( so - called s - curve ) .",
    "as the threshold is common to all chip channels , it is determined by the s - curve with the highest inflexion point . by changing the preamplifier gain of each chip channels ,",
    "it is possible to squeeze the s - curves close together and lower the detection threshold to minimum ( typically down to 34  fc ) .",
    "the determination of the channel preamplifier gain is performed by injecting different test charges in the hardroc circuitry .",
    "once the gain distribution per chip is known , equalization constants are calculated to reduce the spread .",
    "the equalization procedure has been validated as shown in fig .",

    "a dedicated gas chamber , which can house one asu , has been fabricated to perform tests of the asus with @xmath10fe x - rays before they are mounted into the 1m@xmath1 chamber .",
    "it has a perforated aluminum cover onto which is glued a cathode foil with a few nm thin conductive deposit on one side .",
    "it is therefore transparent to @xmath10fe quanta which are almost all absorbed in the 3  cm thick drift gap . by collimating the x - ray beam and by measuring the number of hits recorded per unit time on one pad , relative variations of efficiency can be inferred .",
    "the impact of the chip settings and detector voltages can be quantified this way . as an example , the strong influence of the mesh voltage ( gas gain ) on the detection rate is depicted in fig .",
    "[ hitsvsvmesh ] .",
    "moreover , the box allows to perform the high voltage burn - in in air , which effectively reduces asu s sparking rate by washing out the impurities remaining in the amplification gap after the bulk production .",
    "the first 1m@xmath1 prototype has been successfully built and tested in a particle beam in summer this year .",
    "this experiment has provided precious information for future mass production . during one month operation in a beam ,",
    "the functionality of the daq system and chamber readout electronics has been verified .",
    "gas gains up to 15.000 has been reached with very few high voltage trips and the first test in a power pulsing mode of the readout electronics has been done successfully .",

    "in order to have better understanding of the physics performance of a digital hadron calorimeter with very fine segmentation and its capability to separate hadronic showers , detailed monte carlo simulations of a realistic sid - like calorimeter module  @xcite have been performed  @xcite .",
    "these studies have been focused on the calorimeter response and linearity , energy resolution , shower profiles , and the impact of the leakage .",
    "results obtained for digital readout with different thresholds were compared against the standard analog readout .",
    "fig.[engres ] depicts the energy resolution for single pions as a function of their energy for analog and digital readout with a readout threshold of 15  fc .",
    "superior energy resolution observed for digital readout is due to the suppression of the landau and particle path length fluctuations . on the other hand , due to the saturation in calorimeter response , the linearity of a digital calorimeter is not as good as it is in case of analog one , see fig.[linearity ] .",
    "the saturation effect can be reduced by use of semi - digital readout with two or three thresholds .",
