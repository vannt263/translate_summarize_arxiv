    "gravitational collapse is expected to result in the formation of a black hole , which then evaporates by hawking radiation @xcite . during this process ,",
    "any information contained in the initial state is lost , since black hole evaporation leads to thermal radiation which is uncorrelated with the initial state .",
    "if the initial state is chosen to be a pure quantum state , the final state would be described by a density matrix and would not be a pure state .",
    "the evolution of a pure quantum state into a mixed state violates the tenets of quantum mechanics ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "these problems of black hole formation , evaporation and information loss have been central to discussions of combining general relativity and quantum mechanics over the last several decades .",
    "a number of approaches have been made to resolve the issues that arise in combining black holes and quantum field theory , including more sophisticated calculations of the emitted radiation , modifications of quantum mechanics , modifications of quantum field theory , lower dimensional calculations , loop gravity , and string theory ( _ e.g. _ for some reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "depending on the approach and the new ingredient in the calculation , the conclusions have varied , and no concensus has emerged so far .",
    "the issues have become ever more pressing with discussion of black hole formation in highly energetic collisions in lhc @xcite and by ultra - high energy cosmic rays colliding with the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "in contrast to earlier studies in which a black hole spacetime is adopted as an arena for quantum field theory , we wish to study the temporal development of an initial state that does not contain a black hole . from the laws of quantum mechanics",
    ", the initial state will evolve unitarily in time .",
    "if unitary evolution leads to black hole formation then , as has been described by hawking and others @xcite , unitarity will be lost .    the 3 + 1 dimensional analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite used the functional schrodinger formalism to study the temporal evolution of a scalar field in the _ classical _ background of a gravitating , collapsing , spherical domain wall .",
    "it was found that the collapse was accompanied by quantum radiation of scalar particles , called `` pre - hawking '' radiation , with a non - thermal spectrum .",
    "the analyses in refs .",
    "@xcite were clearly limited by their use of the semiclassical approximation , in which the backreaction of the scalar radiation on the gravitational collapse spacetime is ignored .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to attempt to remedy this shortcoming within the functional schrodinger formalism .",
    "the aim of the present work is to provide a framework to study quantum gravitational collapse beyond the semiclassical approximation .",
    "the framework includes backreaction of the scalar radiation on the collapse dynamics ( see fig .",
    "[ systemfig ] ) .",
    "the specifics of the domain wall plus scalar field system are not expected to be very important for the questions we are interested in .",
    "for example , the hamiltonian for a collapsing wall that is close to forming a black hole reduces to the form for an ultra - relativistic particle @xcite , which is expected to be true for any form of matter .",
    "so the choice of a collapsing domain wall does not affect the near - horizon dynamics .",
    "the scalar field can also be thought of as representing one degree of freedom of a photon or a graviton .",
    "one assumed property that is special though , is the assumed masslessness of the scalar field .",
    "if the scalar field has a mass and/or carries a global or gauge charge , we do expect some differences that we discuss briefly in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "in general , the schrodinger formulation yields a functional differential equation for the wavefunctional , @xmath0 $ ] , where @xmath1 is the metric , @xmath2 the domain wall position , and @xmath3 the scalar field .",
    "we will truncate this problem to minisuperspace , considering only spherical domain walls described by a radial function , @xmath4 , the metric fixed to the schwarzschild form though with variable schwarzschild radius , @xmath5 , and @xmath3 decomposed into modes with mode coefficients @xmath6 .",
    "then the wavefunctional gets replaced by an ordinary wavefunction , @xmath7 .",
    "we are interested in finding the time evolution of this minisuperspace wavefunction , starting from black hole free initial conditions , and in determining if there is a breakdown of the evolution at some time .    in any treatment of the gravitational collapse problem , it is necessary to choose a time coordinate since the collapse , by its very definition , is an evolution problem . in the current analysis",
    ", we have chosen to work with the schwarzschild time coordinate . however , there is the possibility that we may miss some portion of spacetime due to this choice of slicing .",
    "if this were the case , we would expect some sickness ( _ e.g. _ geodesic incompleteness ) to show up in the temporal evolution of the wavefunction . if the temporal evolution remains well - behaved at all times , the evolution is no different from that of an ordinary star for which schwarzschild coordinates are valid and commonly used . in other words",
    ", the schrodinger formulation simply evolves the system forward in time , without assuming the presence or absence of an event horizon in the future .",
    "this is different from other approaches where quantum field theory is used on a spacetime background , where the entire spacetime must be assumed at the onset and then sliced using some coordinate system .",
    "however , it would be worthwhile to re - work gravitational collapse in the schrodinger formalism with a different choice of time coordinate .",
    "the backreaction problem , even for classical point charges , is notorious for its non - local nature , since the trajectory depends on the radiative losses over the entire past .",
    "however , this problem only occurs in a perturbative treatment of a point charge , since there is then a zeroth order trajectory due to which there is radiation , and then backreaction to first order in some coupling constant , then a first order correction to the trajectory , then radiation and backreaction to second order , _",
    "ad infinitum_. instead , if the classical point charge is replaced by a regular solution to some field theory , as in a t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopole , a classical solution of the field theory will include the full dynamics and radiation of the point ( magnetic ) charge .",
    "similarly , the wavefunction for the spherical wall and radiation in the schrodinger formalism , includes the full dynamics of the wall and the radiation and non - locality is absent for this reason . however , there are two other reasons that make the analysis difficult and lead to non - locality .",
    "the first is that the pre - hawking scalar radiation not only affects the dynamics of the collapse but also contributes to the precise form of the metric . in the minisuperspace approach",
    "we have adopted , a form of the metric needs to be specified .",
    "this is chosen to be of the schwarzschild form and thus amounts to the assumption that the energy - momentum tensor in the pre - hawking radiation only causes negligible departures from the minisuperspace .",
    "we expect this approximation to be justified for large collapsing mass where we know that the energy - momentum density of the radiation is comparitively small .",
    "this has also been explicitly verified in the semiclassical calculation @xcite . also , the present approach is similar to that taken in calculating radiation backreaction on an accelerating charge in electrodynamics where the backreaction is taken to affect the dynamics of the charge but the effects on the coulomb electric field of the charge is not considered .",
    "the second factor that complicates the analysis is the non - linear nature of gravity . in particular",
    ", the minisuperspace hamiltonian depends on the mass of the collapsing object , and this is itself related to the hamiltonian . in order to isolate the hamiltonian",
    ", we need to invert the momentum operator and this leads to an integro - differential form for the hamiltonian .",
    "solutions of the corresponding integro - differential schrodinger equation are hard to find in general but we are able to transform the problem to a purely differential equation in the `` incipient limit '' where the collapse approaches black hole formation .",
    "we discuss energy eigenstates in sec .",
    "[ stationary ] and the time - dependent gravitational collapse problem in sec .",
    "[ gravcollapse ] .    in order to solve the gravitational collapse problem",
    ", we need to solve the schrodinger equation to obtain a wavefunction that describes the collapsing wall and radiation .",
    "the first task , however , is to specify an initial value for the wavefunction , such that the initial state itself does not contain a black hole .",
    "this means that we need to specify a criterion for deciding if a given wavefunction is black hole free . to answer this question , we propose a `` black hole operator '' in sec .",
    "[ bhfstate ] .",
    "eigenvalues of the black hole operator signify the `` black holeness '' of the state .",
    "interestingly we find that the black hole operator does not commute with the hamiltonian , implying an uncertainty relation between energy and black holeness .",

    "even when we include the scalar field , we will continue to use the metric in the ipser - sikivie form described above .",
    "this assumes that the dominant effect of backreaction on the metric is to change the wall energy which enters the metric via @xmath5 .",
    "this is not rigorously true since the scalar field also contributes a non - vanishing energy - momentum density .",
    "however , we assume that this contribution is small compared to the energy in the wall . in the conventional case of evaporation from an existing black hole , this corresponds to the assumption that hawking radiation causes the black hole to evaporate and lose mass , but the black hole metric remains schwarzschild to a very good approximation .",

    "that the collapsing mass is large ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ introduction ] ) , the hamiltonian is given by eq .",
    "( [ quantumh ] ) .",
    "a striking feature of the hamiltonian is that it involves the operator @xmath56 which is an integral operator , for which we are also able to find an explicit representation ( eq .  ( [ alphaboperator ] ) )",
    ".    our analysis in the incipient limit should be sufficient to study the problem of quantum collapse and pre - hawking radiation .",
    "however , unlike in the semiclassical approximation where the wall radius takes on a definite value , the wavefunction is defined over the entire range of possible wall radii , including very large radii . in a fuller treatment of the problem",
    ", it may become necessary to extend the hamiltonian that we have found in the incipient limit to large values of the radius .",
    "the precise extension is not expected to be important , as long as the incipient limit of the extended hamiltonian matches the hamiltonian found here .",
    "once we have the minisuperspace schrodinger equation , we need the relevant solutions to it that represent a solution to the gravitational collapse problem",
    ". such a solution would contain the fate of matter that is collapsing towards forming a black hole .",
    "however , the initial conditions have to be chosen to be `` black hole free '' and some measure of `` black holeness '' has to be defined . we have discussed some possible black hole operators , an example of which is the operator @xmath78 that coincides with @xmath56 in the incipient limit .",
    "we find eigenstates of @xmath56 and the eigenvalue @xmath85 may be used as a measure of black holeness .",
    "states with @xmath86 can be said to be black hole free .",
    "however , the black hole operator does not commute with the hamiltonian , thus implying an energy - black holeness uncertainty relation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the eigenfunction @xmath91 of the operator @xmath56 oscillates infinitely fast as @xmath118 which corresponds to the domain wall tending to the event horizon ( see eq .",
    "( [ beigenstate ] ) ) .",
    "naively , if we start with a wavefunction that overlaps only with states with some finite range with @xmath86 , to get an overlap with states with @xmath119 , it would seem that we would need to go through the infinitely oscillating state at @xmath120 .",
    "quantum mechanically , though , this is not clear .",
    "an analogy might help clarify this situation .",
    "in the case of a non - realativistic schrodinger particle , our initial state may be a wavepacket having overlap with only positive momentum eigenstates @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "suppose at some later time , we find that there is non - zero overlap with a negative momentum eigenstate , @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "classically this would mean that the particle s momentum has reversed and so , at some point in time , the particle had to pass through zero momentum .",
    "in quantum mechanics , however , this is not essential since the particle need not even have a well - defined momentum at intermediate times .",
    "so it seems that the singular state at @xmath125 can not be used to argue , at least straightforwardly , that there is an obstruction to the formation of a black hole .",
    "while we have limited ourselves in this paper to a massless scalar field , it is interesting to consider how the analysis might change if the scalar field has a non - vanishing mass . in that case , the spectrum of eigenmodes of the scalar field would contain bound states in addition to scattering states . gravitational collapse of the domain wall would then populate both the scattering and bound states , transferring energy from the wall to pre - hawking radiation and also to an atmosphere of self - gravitating scalar particles .",
    "presumably , the bound states will result in a boson star , though the details are not clear since boson stars as solutions of free or interacting scalar field theory are themselves known to have instabilities if their mass is large @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ stationary ] we have discussed eigenstates of the hamiltonian and in sec .",
    "[ gravcollapse ] we have set up a differential equation that describes the gravitational collapse problem .",
    "the differential equation contains mixed @xmath22 and @xmath41 derivatives , and it may also become singular along curves in the @xmath113 plane .",
    "these characteristics make the equation hard enough that we have postponed attempts at its solution for future work . in its solution , though , might lie answers to some of the questions we have raised in the introduction , and we may be able to see if the unitary evolution contained in the schrodinger equation is self - limiting . on the other hand , it may be that the schrodinger equation always yields unitary evolution , and since it is expected that black holes violate unitarity , it may be impossible to get to the black hole state as suggested by the semiclassical calculation .",
    "i am grateful to gia dvali , gil paz , al shapere and dejan stojkovic for discussions of various aspects of quantum collapse and black holes .",
    "this work was supported by the u.s .",
    "department of energy and nasa at case western reserve university .",
    "the hamiltonian in the incipient limit contains the momentum operator but the variable @xmath41 lies in the interval @xmath95 .",
    "thus @xmath54 resembles the radial momentum operator which is known to have problems with self - adjointness @xcite . for us",
    ", however , @xmath54 only arises in the incipient approximation and there are issues if we blindly use this hamiltonian over the entire range of variables . here",
    "we consider the hermiticity of @xmath54 and @xmath56 , listing the boundary conditions on the wavefunctions necessary to ensure hermiticity .    for the momentum operator we have @xmath126_0^\\infty \\nonumber\\ ] ] the boundary term vanishes",
    "if the functions @xmath127 and @xmath128 vanish at @xmath129 and as @xmath130 .",
    "so @xmath131 when acting ( only ) on this set of functions .",
    "next we find @xmath132 by using the hermiticity of @xmath104 and @xmath54 .",
    "this gives @xmath133_0^\\infty \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so @xmath61 is also hermitian provided @xmath134 and @xmath135 vanish sufficiently rapidly at the origin and do not grow at infinity .",
    "next we find @xmath136 .",
    "@xmath137_0^\\infty          \\nonumber \\\\   & &   \\hskip -2 cm   = \\int_0^\\infty dr ( { \\hat b}f)^\\dag   g            -i 2 g [ ( { \\hat b}f)^\\dag ( { \\hat b}g)/r ] _ 0^\\infty          \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore @xmath138 on functions for which the boundary term vanishes .    if acting on a space of wavefunctions such that the boundary terms are not zero , the operator @xmath56 will not be hermitian .",
    "this need not invalidate the formalism we have developed since the explicit expression for @xmath56 is only really valid in the incipient limit , and does not remain valid at @xmath129 and @xmath139 .",
    "the hamiltonian we have found would also need to be extended beyond the domain of an incipient black hole .",
