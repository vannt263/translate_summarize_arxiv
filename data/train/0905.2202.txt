    "we will use the theory of unbounded hermitian operators with dense domain in hilbert space in a study of infinite weighted graphs with view to limits at infinity .",
    "we begin with introducing the tools from operator theory as developed by h. m. stone , john von neumann , kurt friedrichs , and tosio kato with view to our particular setup .",
    "we stress that a hermitian operator may not be selfadjoint , and that the discrepancy is measured by deficiency - indices ( details below and the books @xcite and @xcite , and more recently @xcite and @xcite . ) in physical problems , see e.g. , @xcite , these mathematical notions of defect take the form of boundary conditions ;  for example waves that are diffracted on the boundary of a region in euclidean space ; the scattering of classical waves on a bounded obstacle @xcite ; a quantum mechanical particle  in a repulsive potential that shoots to infinity in finite time ; or in more recent applications ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) random walk on infinite weighted graphs @xmath2 that wander off  to points on an idealized boundary of @xmath2 . in all of the instances ,",
    "one is faced with a dynamical problem : for example , the solution to a schrdinger equation , represents the time evolution of quantum states in a particular problem in atomic physics .",
    "the operators in these applications will be hermitian , but in order to solve the dynamical problems , one must first identify a selfadjoint extension of the initially given operator .",
    "once that is done , von neumann s spectral theorem can then be applied to the selfadjoint operator .",
    "a choice of selfadjoint extension will have a spectral resolution , i.e. , it is an integral of an orthogonal projection valued measure ; with the different extensions representing different physical  boundary conditions .",
    "hence non - zero deficiency indices measure degrees of non - selfadjointness , and deficiency spaces measure  boundary obstructions or scattering on an obstacle .",
    "the variety of applied problems that lend themselves to computation of deficiency indices and the study of selfadjoint extensions are vast and diverse . as a result",
    ", it helps if one can identify additional structures that throw light on the problem .",
    "our results are inspired in part by the following recent developments in related areas : fractals in the small and in the large @xcite , representation theory @xcite , operator algebras @xcite , harmonic analysis @xcite ; and multiresolutions / wavelets @xcite .",
    "we will further use notions from dynamics , infinite matrix products , to prove essential selfadjointness of families of hermitian operators arising naturally in reproducing kernel hilbert spaces .",
    "the latter include graph laplacians for infinite weighted graphs @xmath3 with the laplacian in this context presented as a hermitian operator in an associated hilbert space of finite energy functions on the vertex set in @xmath2 .",
    "other examples include hilbert spaces of band - limited signals .",
    "further applications enter into the techniques used in discrete simulations of stochastic integrals , see @xcite .",
    "we encountered the present operator theoretic results in our study of discrete laplacians , which in turn have part of its motivation in numerical analysis .",
    "a key tool in applying numerical analysis to solving partial differential equations is discretization , and use of repeated differences ; see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "specifically , one picks a grid size @xmath4 , and then proceeds in steps : ( 1 ) starting with a partial differential operator , then study an associated discretized operator with the use of repeated differences on the @xmath4-lattice in @xmath5 .",
    "( 2 ) solve the discretized problem for @xmath4 fixed . ( 3 ) as @xmath4 tends to zero , numerical analysts evaluate the resulting approximation limits , and they bound the error terms .",
    "for this purpose , one must use a metric , and the norm in hilbert space has proved an effective tool , hence the hilbert spaces and the operator theory .",
    "this procedure connects to our present graph - laplacians : when discretization is applied to the laplace operator in @xmath6 continuous variables , the result is the graph of integer points @xmath7 with constant weights .",
    "but if numerical analysis is applied instead to a continuous laplace operator on a riemannian manifold , the discretized laplace operator will instead involve infinite graph with variable weights , so with vertices in other configurations than @xmath7 .",
    "inside the technical sections we will use standard tools from analysis and probability .",
    "references to the fundamentals include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is a large literature covering the general theory of reproducing kernel hilbert spaces and its applications , see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "such applications include potential theory , stochastic integration , and boundary value problems from pdes among others . in brief summary ,",
    "a reproducing kernel hilbert space @xmath8 consists of two things : a hilbert space of functions @xmath9 on a set @xmath0 , and a reproducing kernel @xmath10 , i.e. , a complex valued function @xmath10 on @xmath11 such that for every @xmath12 in @xmath0 , the function @xmath13 is in @xmath8 and reproduces the value @xmath14 from the inner product @xmath15 in @xmath8 , so the formula @xmath16 holds for all @xmath12 in @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , there is a set of axioms for a function @xmath10 in two variables that characterizes precisely when it determines a reproducing kernel hilbert space . and conversely there are necessary and sufficient conditions that apply to hilbert spaces @xmath8 and decide when @xmath8 is a reproducing kernel hilbert space .",
    "here we shall restrict these reproducing  axioms and obtain instead a smaller class of reproducing kernel hilbert spaces .",
    "we add two additional axioms : firstly , we will be reproducing not the values themselves of the functions @xmath9 in @xmath8 , but rather the differences @xmath17 for all pairs of points in @xmath0 ; and secondly we will impose one additional axiom to the effect that the dirac mass at @xmath12 is contained in @xmath8 for all @xmath12 in @xmath8 .",
    "when these two additional conditions are satisfied , we say that @xmath8 is a relative reproducing kernel hilbert space .",
    "it is known that every weighted graph ( the infinite case is of main concern here ) induces a relative reproducing kernel hilbert space , and an associated graph laplacian . under certain conditions ,",
    "the converse holds as well : given a relative reproducing kernel hilbert space @xmath8 on a set @xmath0 , it is then possible in a canonical way to construct a weighted graph @xmath2 such that @xmath0 is the set of edges in @xmath2 , and such that its energy hilbert space coincides with @xmath8 itself . in our construction , the surprise is that the edges in @xmath2 as well as the weights on the edges may be built directly from only the hilbert space axioms defining the initially given relative reproducing kernel hilbert space .",
    "since this includes all infinite graphs of electrical resistors and their potential theory ( boundaries , harmonic functions , and graph laplacians ) the result has applications to these fields , and it serves to unify diverse branches in a vast research area .",
    "this section contains the precise definitions of the terms used above , and to be used in later sections : the particular discrete networks , the weights on edges , the associated hilbert spaces , and the infinite laplacians .",
    "we open with two lemmas which establish links between the graph theoretic networks on one side , and the operator theory ( unbounded hermitian operators ) on the other .",
    "this will allow us to encode certain boundaries  with two subspaces of an associated hilbert space .",

    "<S> we prove that there are two closed subspaces in reproducing kernel hilbert space @xmath1 which measure quantitative notions of limits at infinity in @xmath0 , one generalizes finite - energy harmonic functions in @xmath1 , and the other a deficiency index of a natural operator in @xmath1 associated directly with the diffusion . </S>",
