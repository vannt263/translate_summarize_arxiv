    "correlated systems with competing on - site and intersite coulomb interactions  @xcite and fillings away from one electron per site ( @xmath11 , half filling ) are presently a subject of intensive investigation due to the appearance of complex phases such as unconventional charge and magnetic orders .",
    "these systems become even more challenging when novel lattice structures emerge out of the original lattice in the region of strong correlations  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is often found in geometrically frustrated systems , such as triangular and kagome lattices .    on the triangular lattice , for instance ,",
    "large on - site @xmath0 and nearest - neighbor @xmath1 coulomb interactions generate effective honeycomb and enlarged triangular lattices at @xmath12 filling ( @xmath13 ) by inducing charge disproportionation  @xcite . when @xmath14 the system tends to create a honeycomb lattice of empty sites and an enlarged triangular lattice of doubly occupied sites , while at smaller ratios of @xmath15 the system evolves into a honeycomb lattice of singly occupied sites with long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "a similar charge ordered state with noncollinear magnetic order has also been proposed in the kondo lattice system  @xcite .",
    "while these states are insulating , such exotic charge and magnetic orders become metallic away from the commensurate filling  @xcite . furthermore , at quarter filling ( @xmath16 ) , metallic states , named pinball liquids , have been also recently proposed  @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by a three - sublattice structure , in which the carriers of one sublattice are essentially localized ( pins ) , with the remaining charges ( balls ) building an itinerant liquid on the interstitials . recently , other mechanisms than direct charge disproportionation have been also proposed to generate new lattice structures such as the emergence of a kagome lattice via spontaneous ferrimagnetic order coexisting with a @xmath17 charge order pattern in a triangular kondo lattice  @xcite .",
    "similarly , on the kagome lattice , large values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been discussed to induce nearly isolated six - site rings and an enlarged kagome lattice at @xmath12 filling ( @xmath13 )  @xcite . specifically , when @xmath18 and @xmath19 , each corner - sharing triangle possesses charge order characterized by two singly occupied sites and an empty site .",
    "the empty site randomly sits on one of the three vertices of a triangle , which gives macroscopic charge degeneracy .",
    "nonzero hopping @xmath9 lifts the charge degeneracy and appears to stabilize a @xmath17 charge pattern , whose unit cell contains nine sites  @xcite .",
    "recently , by mapping the system into a hard - core boson hamiltonian , a topological liquid was also proposed  @xcite .    reported realizations of such emergent lattices are for instance the generation of a honeycomb structure through charge disproportion in the metallic magnet @xmath20",
    "@xcite or the appearance of effective spin-@xmath21 chains in the heavy - fermion spinel @xmath22  @xcite .    actually , even when the lattice structures themselves are not geometrically frustrated , such a formation of new lattices is possible due to strong electron correlations .",
    "for example , in the cubic lattice , a staggered @xmath23 charge order generates doubled face - centered - cubic lattices  @xcite",
    ". moreover , effective spin and charge interactions in such systems may acquire additional geometrical frustrations .",
    "indeed , unconventional noncoplanar magnetic orders have been proposed in the periodic anderson model on the cubic lattice at @xmath3 filling  @xcite .",

    ", we investigate the possible emergence of correlation - induced new lattice structures both in a bipartite and in a geometrically frustrated lattice at fillings that , to our knowledge , have not been investigated before .",
    "in particular , we perform an extensive analysis of the spinful extended hubbard model on honeycomb and triangular lattices away from half filling , and focus on the interplay between on - site @xmath0 and intersite nearest- and next - nearest coulomb interactions @xmath1 and @xmath4 , respectively . by using the hartree - fock approximation , as well as perturbation theory and the variational monte carlo method",
    ", we find that a triangular structure emerges from charge order on the honeycomb lattice for large values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at @xmath2 filling ( @xmath3 , three electrons per two sites on average ) .",
    "charge - poor sites possess spin degrees of freedom , and their spin correlations are found to be antiferromagnetic in most of the phase diagram , while they become ferromagnetic when @xmath0 is much larger than @xmath1 .    on the other hand , for the triangular lattice with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath4 interactions at @xmath5 filling ( @xmath6 , three electrons per four sites on average ) , considering large values of @xmath0 and a finite @xmath4 ( we set @xmath24 ) , we find that the system shows rich charge orders : a kagome structure emerges for intermediate values of @xmath1 , while a one - dimensional structure is stabilized for large values of @xmath1 .",
