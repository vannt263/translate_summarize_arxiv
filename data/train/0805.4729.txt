    "the recent realization that some extended objects in fundamental string theory @xcite can have cosmological size has triggered a lot of interest both in the fundamental string and the cosmic string community . in braneworld scenarios ,",
    "big quantities of two types of cosmic size `` strings '' ( cosmic superstrings ) can be produced @xcite when bane - antibrane pairs annihilate each other : fundamental ( f ) strings and dirichlet ( d ) strings , which can be either a one dimensional brane ( d1-brane ) or a higher dimensional brane with all but one dimension compactified .",
    "these two kinds of strings interact with each other @xcite forming bound states : @xmath0 f - strings can interact with @xmath1 d - strings to form ( p , q ) bound states , resulting in a network of f- , d- and fd - strings",
    ".    networks of ( p , q ) string have been investigated in several papers lately , both analytically and numerically , and both in the realms of fundamental strings and solitonic gauge strings @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of ( p , q ) network is more complicated than `` usual '' ( solitonic ) cosmic strings : the intercommutation of solitonic strings is almost always one , whereas in ( p , q ) strings it is usually less than one , and often much less than one .",
    "generally , solitonic strings do not form bound states , so that 3-way y junctions do not form , whereas ( p , q ) strings are known to form stable bound states , and therefore create y junctions .",
    "all strings in a network of ordinary solitonic strings have the same tension , whereas there is a whole range of different tensions in a ( p , q ) network .",
    "properties of ordinary ( solitonic ) comics strings have been thoroughly studied , and their network properties are better understood than those of ( p , q ) strings .",
    "they are known to be generically formed in supersymmetric hybrid inflation @xcite and grand unified based inflationary models @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable effort in numerically modelling networks to obtain observables ; for example , modeling field theoretical cosmic strings to obtain cmb power spectra @xcite .",
    "the gravitational properties of solitonic cosmic strings have also be studied in detail by minimally coupling the abelian higgs model to gravity . far away from the core of the string ,",
    "the space - time has a deficit angle , i.e. corresponds to minkowski space - time minus a wedge @xcite .",
    "the deficit angle is in linear order proportional to the energy per unit length of the string .",
    "if the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field is sufficiently large ( corresponding to very heavy strings that have formed at energies much bigger than the gut scale ) , the deficit angle becomes larger than @xmath2 .",
    "these solutions are the so - called `` supermassive strings '' studied in @xcite and possess a singularity at a maximal value of the radial coordinate , at which the angular part of the metric vanishes .",
    "interestingly , it was realized only a few years ago @xcite that both the globally regular string solution as well as the supermassive solution have `` shadow '' solutions that exist for the same parameter values .",
    "the string - like solutions with deficit angle @xmath3 have a shadow solution in the form of so - called melvin solutions , which have a different asymptotic behaviour of the metric and have higher energies than their string counterparts ( and are thus very likely cosmologically not relevant ) .",
    "the supermassive string solutions on the other hand have shadow solutions of kasner - type .",
    "kasner solutions possess also a singularity at some finite radial distance , the difference is that for kasner solutions , the @xmath4-component of the metric vanishes at this maximal radial distance , while the angular part of the metric diverges there . since both supermassive as well as kasner solutions contain space - time singularities they are surely of limited interest for cosmological applications .",
    "it is partly due to the fact that advanced machinery exists to study solitonic strings that different authors have tried to capture properties of ( p , q ) string networks using field theoretical models .",
    "one can construct field theory models that give rise to solitonic strings that share some of the properties of cosmic superstrings .",
    "for example , abelian higgs strings can have a reconnexion probability which is less than one when the strings meet at very high velocities @xcite .",
    "also , type - i abelian higgs strings can form bound states ( and have strings of different tensions ) when they meet at low velocities @xcite , or if a network of ( type i ) strings with high winding numbers forms in a thermal phase transition @xcite . in models with susy flat directions strings with type i properties can also be formed @xcite .",
    "a maybe more realistic approximation is given by the models of saffin @xcite and rajantie , sakellariadou and stoica @xcite , where two independent abelian higgs string models are coupled via an interacting potential .",
    "the strength with which the strings interact and form bound states can be controlled by the parameters in the potential , giving rise to numerically more feasible and controllable simulations , including network simulations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we couple minimally the models of saffin and rajantie  to gravity , and investigate the gravitating properties of this field theoretical approximations of ( p , q ) cosmic superstrings . in the next section",
    "we describe the models and set up the anstze and boundary conditions . in section [ nr ]",
    "we report the numerical solutions found for the models studied , and then conclude .",
    "the models we are studying are given by the following action : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the ricci scalar and @xmath7 denotes newton s constant .",
    "the matter lagrangian @xmath8 reads : @xmath9 with the covariant derivatives @xmath10 , @xmath11 and the field strength tensors @xmath12 , @xmath13 of the two u(1 ) gauge potential @xmath14 , @xmath15 with coupling constants @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    ". the fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 are complex scalar fields ( higgs fields ) .",
    "we will study two different potentials , corresponding to saffin @xcite ( @xmath20 ) and rajantie  @xcite ( @xmath21 )    v_1(,)=(^*-^2_1)^2 + ( ^*-^2_2)^2 -_3(^*-^2_1)(^*-^2_2 ) and v_2(,)= ( ^*-^2_1)^2 + ^*(^*-^2_2)^2    in the first model ( @xmath20 ) the interaction term makes the strings form a bound state depending on the value of @xmath22 @xcite : for @xmath23 bounds states will be formed . in this paper",
    "we will investigate the special case where the parameters correspond to the bogomolnyi limit ( more explicitly , to what would be the bogomolnyi limit if @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) _",
    "1=2e_1 ^ 2_2=2e_2 ^ 2 and we will eventually rescale parameters such that @xmath26 , though we will keep them explicit throughout our equations .",
    "it is also worth reminding that by setting @xmath24 we recover two non - interacting abelian higgs strings in curved space - time .    for the second case",
    ", the interaction ensures that it is energetically favourable to form bound states for @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( otherwise , the potential will not be bounded from below ) .",
    "this is clearly seen by observing that the potential energy of the @xmath19 field vanishes where @xmath29 , therefore favouring that both string cores lie on top of each other .      in the following",
    "we shall analyse the system of coupled differential equations associated with the gravitationally coupled system described above .",
    "this system will contain the euler - lagrange equations for the matter fields and the einstein equations for the metric fields . in order to do that ,",
    "let us write down the matter and gravitational fields as shown below .",
    "the most general , cylindrically symmetric line element invariant under boosts along the @xmath30direction is : @xmath31 the non - vanishing components of the ricci tensor @xmath32 then read @xcite : @xmath33 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath34 .    for the matter and gauge fields",
    ", we have @xcite : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 are integers indexing the vorticity of the two higgs fields around the @xmath30axis .",
    "we define the following dimensionless variable and function :    @xmath41    then , the total lagrangian only depends on the following dimensionless coupling constants    @xmath42    varying the action with respect to the matter fields and metric functions , we obtain a system of six non - linear differential equations .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for the matter field functions read : @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 where the prime now and in the following denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath47 .",
    "we use the einstein equations in the following form : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the trace of the energy momentum tensor @xmath50 and the non - vanishing components of the energy - momentum tensor are ( we use the notation of @xcite ) with @xmath51 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 corresponding to the choice of potential @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",

    "where @xmath59 and @xmath60 the boundary conditions ( [ eom1 ] ) change according to : @xmath61 while for a @xmath62 , @xmath63 string , they read @xmath64    by letting the derivatives of the non - winding scalar field be zero at the origin instead of imposing the boundary conditions for the fields themselves , the non - winding scalar field can take non - zero values at the origin and , as it is indeed the case , a `` condensate '' of the non - winding scalar field will form in the core of the winding string .",
    "the finiteness of the energy per unit length requires : @xmath65    we define as inertial mass per unit length of the solution @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the determinant of the @xmath68-dimensional space - time given by @xmath69 .",
    "this then reads : @xmath70    as mentioned earlier , for saffin s model @xmath20 , @xmath71 corresponds to two non - interacting strings . in the bps limit (",
    "the limit we are dealing with ) the inertial mass ( in units of @xmath2 ) of the @xmath72 string is just @xmath73 .",
    "this is because the mass is equal to the sum of the masses of the @xmath74-string and of the @xmath75-string , which is @xmath76 .",
    "correspondingly , the deficit angle ( in units of @xmath2 ) is just @xmath77 .",
    "we can then define the binding energy of an @xmath78 string as @xmath79",
    "the solutions for @xmath80 , i.e. in flat space - time have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite . when @xmath81 is increased from zero , the ( p , q)-strings get deformed by gravity .",
    "if @xmath81 is not too large , globally regular solutions exist .",
    "these solutions fall into two categories @xcite : the string solutions and the melvin solutions , where the latter have no flat - space counterpart .",
    "the string solutions are those of astrophysical interest since they describe solutions with a deficit angle and because the melvin solutions are heavier than their string counterparts .",
    "the metric functions then have the following behaviour at infinity : @xmath82 where the @xmath83 , @xmath84 are constants that depend on the choice of @xmath81 , @xmath85 , @xmath84 , @xmath1 and @xmath86 .",
    "the solution has a deficit angle which is given by @xmath87 if the deficit angle @xmath88 , @xmath89 and the solution would have a singularity at a finite , parameter - dependent value of @xmath90 with @xmath91 , while @xmath92 stays finite .",
    "these solutions are the so - called supermassive string solutions @xcite ( or inverted string solutions ) .",
    "the melvin solutions exist for the same parameter values as the string solutions , but have a different asymptotic behaviour : @xmath93 where again @xmath94 and @xmath95 are parameter dependent constants .",
    "this latter solution is thus not a cosmic string solution in the standard sense since it corresponds to a solution for which the circumference of circles will decay in the asymptotic region .",
