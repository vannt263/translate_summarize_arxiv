    "the ism interacts with supernova explosions , protostellar jets , winds and outflows , which shape its structure and drive the turbulence we observe via atomic and molecular line observations of the ism .    in many simulations that include an ism ( e.g. , *",

    "it has also been studied by employing a heating and cooling curve @xcite .",

    "the exponent @xmath33 of the @xmath23 relation , however , is significantly steeper with @xmath34 for @xmath21 and @xmath35 for @xmath27 , compared to the isothermal case , where @xmath36 provides the best fit to the data .",
    "thus , we see that the exponent @xmath33 in the density variance ",
    "mach number relation is @xmath29-dependent .    in order to provide a heuristic relation that describes the behaviour of @xmath23 in adiabatic gases",

    "the result is @xmath30 .",
    "the actual dependence might be somewhat different , but to determine a better fit would require us to measure @xmath33 for a range of @xmath29 values , in much smaller steps @xmath38 .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : result ] ) naturally simplifies to the well - studied isothermal case ( @xmath32 ) given by equation  ( [ relation1 ] ) , but also approximately covers cases with @xmath20 , up to @xmath27 .",
    "in  [ sec : case1][sec : sumad ] , we found that the density variance ",
    "mach number relation for adiabatic gases with @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , deviates significantly from the isothermal case , equation  ( [ relation1 ] ) .",
    "we quantified the discrepancy by fitting an alternative function , equation  ( [ eq : newfit ] ) , to the data , with the power - law exponent @xmath33 as a free fit parameter .",
    "we find that the power law provides excellent fits , with power - law exponents increasing with @xmath29 from @xmath36 for the isothermal case ( @xmath32 ) to @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "a heuristic function was obtained to provide a new @xmath23 relation that takes the dependence on @xmath29 into account , given by equation  ( [ eq : result ] ) .",
    "we now compare this results to a recent theoretical model for the density variance ",
    "mach number relation , in order to explain the differences of our adiabatic case to the isothermal and polytropic cases .",
    "the detailed derivation of the relation can be found in @xcite and @xcite , where this relation has been explored for magnetized isothermal and polytropic gases respectively , with the latter representing a special case , where the pressure and temperature of the gas are both uniquely related to the density via @xmath40 we emphasize that this is different from the adiabatic eos , equation  ( [ eq : eos ] ) , used here , in that the pressure depends on both density and temperature , @xmath41 .",
    "thus , for any given value of density , the pressure can vary depending on the temperature , while a polytropic eos will give only a single value of @xmath42 for a given input @xmath14 .",
    "the basic idea of the theoretical model is to relate the density jump in a single shock to the ensemble of shocks / compressions in a turbulent medium . for that purpose , @xcite and",
    "@xcite applied the equations of mass , momentum and energy conservation across a shock , @xmath43 to derive the density contrast @xmath44 between the pre - shock gas ( denoted with index 0 and on the left - hand side of the equations ) and the post - shock gas ( no index ; right - hand side of the shock jump equations ) .",
    "the equation of state , equation  ( [ eq : eos ] ) , enters through the pressure @xmath42 and specific internal energy @xmath45 in these expressions .",
    "combining these equations leads to the well - known rankine - hugoniot shock jump conditions as the solution for the density jump across the shock @xcite , @xmath46 note that we have already introduced the geometrical @xmath17-parameter , because these shock jump conditions only apply to the plane - parallel component of the shock , parametrized by the parallel component of the sonic mach number @xmath47 @xcite . following the detailed derivation in @xcite , equation  ( [ eq : shockjump ] )",
    "just needs to be inserted into the general expression for the ensemble of such shocks , @xmath48 which leads to the density variance ",
    "mach number relation , @xmath49 we immediately see that this new @xmath29-dependent density variance ",
    "mach number relation reduces to the isothermal case , equation  ( [ relation1 ] ) , if we set @xmath37 . in the adiabatic case , however , @xmath20 , which leads to our theoretical prediction as a function of @xmath29 , given by equation  ( [ eq : theory ] ) .        fig .",
    "[ fig : theory ] shows the theoretical prediction given by equation  ( [ eq : theory ] ) for different values of @xmath29 together with the isothermal solution and together with our simulation data for @xmath21 and @xmath27 .",
    "we see that the new relation qualitatively follows the trend of a slightly steeper rise with increasing @xmath29 for low mach number .",
    "it also predicts that at high mach number , the density variance saturates at lower @xmath1 for increasing @xmath29 .",
    "this is reasonable , because the density jump across shocks reduces significantly with increasing @xmath29 as derived in equation  ( [ eq : shockjump ] ) .",
    "this regime needs to be tested in follow - up simulations that reach higher mach numbers .",
    "however , the problem is that the adiabatic heating increases with increasing mach , such that it quickly counteracts the effect of an increased driving amplitude .    despite these reasonable qualitative trends produced by our new theoretical relation , equation  ( [ eq : theory ] ) , we see that the actual simulation data with @xmath20 still follow a somewhat steeper curve at low mach number , @xmath6 in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane .",
    "we speculate that this discrepancy arises , because the theoretical model does not contain any information about the temporal evolution of the gas , in particular about its temperature changes along the evolutionary curve",
    ".    however , we can qualitatively argue that any shock will immediately experience the temperature and pressure increase associated with the adiabatic compression . this will reduce the density jump significantly , such that the density variance will be smaller with increasing @xmath29 almost immediately when these shocks are about to form , ( e.g. , the theoretical limit for @xmath27 is @xmath50 ) .",
    "thus , shocks in high-@xmath29 gas will be significantly reduced and so will be the statistical variance of density fluctuations , @xmath1 .",
    "the important point here is that this process almost instantaneously reduces the density variance .    at the same time",
    ", each shock dissipates energy , locally increasing the temperature and internal energy of the ideal adiabatic gas .",
    "this increases the sound speed , but at first only locally in the shocks , which leads to a decreasing pre - shock sonic mach number over time , resulting in the time evolution ( shown as arrows ) in figs .",
    "[ fig : g1.4 ] and  [ g1.66 ] .",
    "we can thus qualitatively understand the time dependence and resulting @xmath23 relations for @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath23 relation is steeper , because @xmath1 responds almost instantaneously to the local pressure and temperature increase in shocks , while the mach number reduction is delayed , because the sound speed increases only in the post - shock gas , while our theoretical equation  ( [ eq : theory ] ) is based on the large - scale , volume - weighted pre - shock mach number .        in order to substantiate our findings , we show density , temperature , pressure , and entropy slices of our highest - resolution simulation with @xmath0 grid cells and adiabatic @xmath27 in fig .  [",
    "fig : slices ] .",
    "we see two important points .",
    "first , the pressure and temperature are not unique functions of the density , but for a given density , the gas can have a range of temperatures and pressures , as implied by equation  ( [ eq : eos ] )",
    ". this is substantiated by the entropy slice shown in the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : slices ] , which is not uniform , demonstrating that the gas is not barotropic , but that the pressure depends on density _ and _ temperature .",
    "there is clearly viscous heating , which is primarily due to shocks in the @xmath8 regime , while turbulent dissipation ( eddy viscosity ) becomes a more important heating mechanism when @xmath51 .",
    "quantifying both contributions is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "second , the adiabatic heating primarily occurs in the post - shock gas .",
    "the rise of the internal energy does not immediately reduce the global post - shock mach number , but slowly diffuses to large scales , before it affects @xmath2 , leading to the steeper - than - isothermal @xmath23 relations we found for @xmath20 .        finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : corrpdfs ] shows density  temperature correlation probability density functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "it is evident that for any given density , there is a wide range of temperatures and that the heating indeed primarily occurs in the densest gas , i.e. , in the post - shock regions .",
    "also note the continuous increase in the overall temperature of the gas between @xmath52 ( left - hand panel ) and @xmath53 ( right - hand panel ) , which leads to the slowly decreasing @xmath2 over time .",
    "we performed hydrodynamical simulations of supersonic and subsonic turbulence , employing an ideal equation of state ( eos ) with adiabatic indices @xmath54 ( nearly isothermal ) , @xmath21 ( diatomic molecular gas ) , and @xmath27 ( monatomic gas ) .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] provided a detailed analysis of the density variance ",
    "mach number relation , @xmath23 , which is a key ingredient for theoretical models of the star formation rate and the initial mass function .",
    "unlike previous studies of purely isothermal and polytropic turbulence , we find that an ideal gas eos leads to a steeper dependence of the density variance @xmath1 on the rms sonic mach number @xmath2 .",
    "we find a new combined approximate relation of the form given by equation  ( [ eq : result ] ) for low mach numbers , @xmath6 , which reduces to the well known isothermal solution for the special case @xmath32 , but also covers cases @xmath20 .",
    "we argue that the steeper - than - isothermal dependence for @xmath6 is a result of the local heating of the gas in post - shock regions , with the global sonic pre - shock mach number in the relation being affected later in the evolution .",
    "this is because the turbulent driving keeps increasing the internal energy reservoir , leading to an ever increasing global sound speed in adiabatic gases .",
    "this is in stark contrast to isothermal and polytropic gases , where the sonic mach number reaches a statistical steady state rather than continuously decreasing .",
    "we derived a theoretical model , equation  ( [ eq : theory ] ) , for the @xmath23 relation in section  [ sec : discussion ] , which is based on the rankine - hugoniot shock jump conditions and provides reasonable fits to all our data .",
    "it furthermore predicts a saturation of @xmath1 for @xmath55 , which is not yet in reach by numerical simulations .",
    "such a saturation is reasonable for @xmath20 , given the fact that adiabatic shocks always have a finite jump in density , while isothermal shocks can theoretically have an infinitely large jump in density across the shock .",
    "both equation  ( [ eq : result ] ) for @xmath6 and equation  ( [ eq : theory ] ) for @xmath8 naturally simplify to the standard isothermal relation , equation  ( [ relation1 ] ) for @xmath37 .",
    "we conclude that changes in the adiabatic exponent @xmath29 can introduce important modifications in the density variance ",
    "mach number relation and we provide an approximation of that behaviour in equation  ( [ eq : result ] ) . however , we emphasize that the real ism is a mixture of atomic and molecular phases and that the effective eos is determined by a complex balance of heating and cooling processes , which in turn depend on the chemical evolution and exposure to interstellar and local radiation fields ( e.g. , from massive stars ) .",
    "thus , our systematic study sheds some light on the dependence of turbulent density fluctuations on the thermodynamics and composition of interstellar gas and more detailed studies including realistic heating and cooling are required to make further progress .",
    "we hope that this work provides a more general understanding of the density variance ",
    "mach number relation in the ism .",
    "this is especially true for the warm , atomic part of the ism , where the gas is clearly not isothermal and may be approximated with an adiabatic equation of state with @xmath56 , which was not covered by previous density variance ",
    "mach number relations in the literature .",
    "our new relations in this paper attempt to cover this regime and do seem to approximately do so , as tested with the set of simulations presented here .",
    "we hope that the new relations will provide useful generalisations of the previous ( purely isothermal ) relations , which are key ingredients for theoretical models of star formation ( see e.g. , the review by * ? ? ?",
