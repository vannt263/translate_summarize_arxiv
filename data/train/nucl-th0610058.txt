    "such mass shifts in nuclear matter can be used to calculate the pion - nucleus optical potential @xcite which are different for different charged states .",

    "pion propagation in anm is qualitatively different from snm .",
    "this , as we show , is due to the possible splitting and mixing of the collective modes .",
    "both the splitting of isospin multiplets and the coupling of the isoscalar and isovector oscillations are related to the ground state induced isospin symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "clearly charged and neutral pion masses will be non - degenerate once the density dependent dressings of the pion propagators in anm are considered . such splitting may also be observed in vacuum due to virtual nucleon - antinucleon excitations if the mass(m ) splitting of neutron(@xmath9 ) and proton(@xmath10 ) are taken into account ( or at the quark level @xmath11-@xmath12 mass difference ) .",
