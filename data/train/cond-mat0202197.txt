    "_  @xcite reported on a measurement of the transmission phase through a quantum dot ( qd ) .",
    "these authors used an aharanov  bohm ( ab ) interferometer with the qd embedded in one of its arms .",
    "the device is schematically shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the current through the device is made up of coherent contributions from both arms and is , therefore , a periodic function of the magnetic flux @xmath0 through the ab interferometer .",
    "a sequence of coulomb  blockade resonances in the qd was swept by adjusting the plunger gate voltage @xmath1 on the qd .",
    "( the plunger gate is not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the phase shift @xmath2 of the oscillatory part of the current was measured as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to this phase shift as to the transmission phase through the qd .",
    "as expected , @xmath2 showed an increase by @xmath3 over each coulomb  blockade resonance .",
    "the ab interferometer of ref .",
    "@xcite was attached to six external leads .",
    "the complexity of this arrangement was caused by the failure of an earlier two  lead experiment  @xcite also aimed at measuring @xmath2 . instead of a smooth rise by @xmath3 over the width of each resonance , a sudden jump by @xmath3 near each resonance was observed .",
    "this feature was later understood to be caused by a special symmetry property of the two  lead experiment  @xcite : the conductance @xmath4 and , therefore , the current are symmetric functions of @xmath0 and , hence , even in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , @xmath5 is a function of @xmath6 only , and the apparent phase jump of @xmath2 by @xmath3 is actually due to the vanishing at some value of @xmath1 near resonance of the coefficient multiplying @xmath7 .    2    following the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , theoretical attention was largely focused on the least expected feature of the data of ref .",
    "@xcite : a sequence of coulomb  blockade resonances displayed very similar behavior regarding the dependence of both , the conductance and the transmission phase , on @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 displayed a rapid drop between neighboring coulomb ",
    "blockade resonances . for references , see ref .",
    "it is only recently that entin ",
    "wohlman , aharony , imry , levinson , and schiller  @xcite drew attention to the behavior of @xmath8 at a _ single _ resonance . in ref .",
    "@xcite the first four authors consider a three  lead situation .",
    "two leads are attached to the ab interferometer in a fashion analogous to figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the third lead connects directly to the qd .",
    "the authors take the arms of the ab interferometer and the three external leads as one  dimensional wires .",
    "they consider an isolated resonance due to a single state on the qd . solving this model analytically , they come up with a disturbing result : the transmission phase increases by @xmath3 over an energy interval given by that part of the width of the qd which is due to its coupling to the third lead . as this coupling",
    "is gradually turned off , the rise by @xmath3 of @xmath2 becomes ever more steep , and eventually becomes a phase jump by @xmath3 as the coupling to the third lead vanishes . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model is extended to include additional one  dimensional wires directly attached to the ab ring and coupled to it in a special way .",
    "again , it is found that the transmission phase reflects the resonance phase shift only `` for specific ways of opening the system''@xcite .",
    "these results immediately poses the following questions : what is the behavior of @xmath2 for a single resonance in the six  lead case and , more generally , for any number of leads in a geometry like the one shown in figure  [ fig1 ] ? does the rise of @xmath2 by @xmath3 occur over an energy interval given by the actual width of the resonance or only by part of that width ? and",
    "what happens to @xmath8 as the number of leads is gradually reduced to two ?",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to answer these questions within a theoretical framework which is more closely patterned after the experimental situation than is the work of ref .  @xcite . in particular",
    ", our work differs from that of refs .",
    "@xcite in the following respects : we do not assume that the qd is directly coupled to a lead , we do not make any specific assumptions about the way in which the leads are coupled to the ab ring , and we allow for an arbitrary number of leads ( as long as this number is at least equal to two ) and of channels in each lead .",
    "in one of the first theoretical papers  @xcite addressing the data of ref  @xcite , the transmission phase @xmath2 was calculated in the framework of a model designed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for the geometry shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "inspection of the curves published in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the transmission phase rises roughly by @xmath3 over an energy interval roughly equal to the width of each coulomb  blockade resonance .",
    "the curves shown in ref .",
    "@xcite were , however , calculated in the framework of specific assumptions on a number of parameters and do not , therefore , constitute a general answer to the questions raised at the end of section  [ int ] .",
    "still , it is useful to employ again the model used in these calculations",
    ". as we shall see , the model yields a completely general expression for the conductance and its dependence upon @xmath1 and @xmath0 in the framework of the geometry displayed in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "starting point for the study of a case with @xmath9 leads where @xmath9 is integer and @xmath10 is the landauer ",
    "bttiker formula @xmath11 the formula connects the current @xmath12 in lead @xmath13 , @xmath14 with the voltages @xmath15 applied to leads @xmath16 .",
    "the conductance coefficients @xmath17 are given by @xmath18 \\ .",
    "\\label{eqg}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 are the elements of the scattering matrix @xmath20 connecting channel @xmath21 in lead @xmath13 with channel @xmath22 in lead @xmath16 at an energy @xmath23 of the electron .",
    "we have used the terminology of scattering theory and identified the transverse modes of the electron in each lead with the channels .",
    "the function @xmath24 is the fermi function .",
    "we simplify our reasoning by considering very low temperatures where the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eqg ] ) can be replaced by @xmath25 $ ] , identifying the fermi energy parametrically with the plunger gate voltage @xmath1 .",
    "we do so because this brings out the energy dependence of the transmission phase most clearly .",
    "subsequent averaging over temperature does not change the essential aspects .",
    "we recall that the landauer ",
    "bttiker formula is restricted to the case of independent electrons .",
    "this is the approximation used throughout the paper .    to proceed , we must introduce a model for the scattering matrix @xmath26 . we consider a geometrical arrangement of the type shown schematically in figure  [ fig1 ] without , however , limiting ourselves to six channels .",
    "we emphasize that this geometry differs from the one considered in ref.@xcite where , as mentioned above , the qd is directly coupled to one of the leads .",
    "the electrons move independently in the two  dimensional area defined by the leads , the ab interferometer , and the qd .",
    "a homogeneous magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the plane of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the two  dimensional configuration space is divided into disconnected subspaces defined by the interior of the qd , of the ab interferometer without the qd , and by each of the leads .",
    "the free scattering states in lead @xmath13 carry the labels @xmath27 for energy and @xmath21 for the channel , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 the corresponding creation and destruction operators .",
    "the bound states in the closed ab ring have energies @xmath30 , @xmath31 and associated operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the qd supports a single bound state with energy @xmath34 and associated operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this last simplification is introduced because we wish to investigate the behavior of @xmath2 at an _ isolated _ coulomb  blockade resonance . at the expense of an increase of the number of indices ,",
    "this assumption can easily be removed , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the single  particle hamiltonian @xmath37 is accordingly written as the sum of two terms , @xmath38 here , @xmath39 describes free electron motion in each of the disconnected subspaces , @xmath40 the coupling between the various subspaces , and the influence of the magnetic field are contained in the coupling hamiltonian @xmath41 the matrix elements @xmath42 describe the coupling between channel @xmath21 in lead @xmath13 and the state @xmath43 in the ab ring .",
    "there are no barriers separating the leads from the ab ring .",
    "therefore , the coupling to the leads will change the states @xmath43 into strongly overlapping resonances .",
    "we will accordingly assume later that the resulting terms depend smoothly on energy @xmath27 .",
    "we also assume that on the scale of the mean level spacing in the ab ring , the energy dependence of the @xmath44 s is smooth and , in effect , negligible .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath45 describe the coupling between the states @xmath43 and the state in the qd with energy @xmath34 .",
    "the upper index @xmath46 with @xmath47 distinguishes the two barriers which separate the qd from the ab ring , see figure  [ fig1 ] . in our model ,",
    "the topology of the ab ring enters via the occurrence of two independent amplitudes for decay of the state with energy @xmath34 on the qd into each of the states @xmath43 of the ab ring .",
    "because of gauge invariance , the entire dependence of @xmath37 on the applied magnetic field can , without loss of generality , be put into one of the matrix elements @xmath48 .",
    "we accordingly assume that the amplitudes @xmath42 and @xmath49 are real and write @xmath50 in the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is real .",
    "the phase @xmath0 is given by @xmath53 times the magnetic flux through the ab ring in units of the elementary flux quantum . eqs .",
    "( [ eq3],[eq4 ] ) imply that the electron picks up the phase factor @xmath54 as it leaves the qd through barrier @xmath55 . here and likewise in section  [ sca ]",
    ", we neglect all other effects that the magnetic field may have on the motion of the electron , and take account of the aharanov ",
    "bohm phase only .",
    "the hamiltonian used in ref .",
    "@xcite differs from our @xmath39 in that it also contains the coulomb interaction between electrons within the qd in a mean  field approximation .",
    "this interaction is known  @xcite to be important for the behavior of the phase of the transmission amplitude through the qd between resonances .",
    "it is not expected , however , to affect this phase in the domain of an isolated coulomb  blockade resonance , or the width of such a resonance .",
    "one may wonder whether the model defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) to ( [ eq4 ] ) is sufficiently general to give a completely satisfactory answer to the questions posed at the end of section  [ int ] .",
    "it is for this reason that we now derive the form of the scattering matrix from very general principles . these are unitarity , time ",
    "reversal invariance , the topology of the ab interferometer , gauge invariance , and the single  level approximation for the passage of electrons through the qd . as remarked above , the last of these assumptions can easily be lifted . at the end",
    ", it will turn out that the scattering matrix determined in this way has indeed the same form as the one calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) to ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the total scattering matrix @xmath20 for the passage of electrons through the ab interferometer is the sum of two terms .",
    "we consider first the contribution @xmath56 from that arm of the interferometer which does not contain the qd .",
    "( in the scheme of figure  [ fig1 ] , the total scattering matrix @xmath57 would become equal to @xmath58 if the barriers @xmath59 and @xmath55 separating the qd from the ab ring were closed ) .",
    "we neglect the dependence of @xmath56 on energy over an interval given by the width of the resonance due to the single level in the qd in the other arm and , therefore , consider @xmath60 as independent of energy .",
    "since @xmath20 is unitary , and since the contribution from the other arm vanishes for energies far from the resonance , @xmath56 must also be unitary .",
    "moreover , @xmath56 is not affected by the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "( as in the model of eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) to ( [ eq4 ] ) , the entire dependence on the magnetic field will be contained in the amplitude coupling the qd to the ab ring through barrier @xmath55 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) below ) .",
    "hence , @xmath56 is time ",
    "reversal invariant and , thus , symmetric .",
    "as is the case for every unitary and symmetric matrix , @xmath56 can be written in the form  @xcite @xmath61 the symbol @xmath62 denotes the transpose of a matrix , and the matrix @xmath63 is unitary .",
    "it is the product of an orthogonal matrix which diagonalizes @xmath56 , and of a diagonal matrix .",
    "the elements of the latter have the form @xmath64 where the @xmath65 s are the eigenphaseshifts of @xmath56 .",
    "we now use the more explicit notation introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) to write @xmath56 as @xmath66 , and @xmath63 as @xmath67 . with @xmath68",

    "wigner form .",

    "is contained explicitly in the phase factors .",

    "thus , the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) accounts for the topology of the ab ring and for gauge invariance . in writing eq .",

    "this term is even in the magnetic flux @xmath0 and has a zero close to the resonance energy @xmath34 . it does not , however , display the smooth increase of the resonance phase phase shift @xmath126 over the width @xmath79 of the resonance .",
    "if , on the other hand , the number of leads @xmath9 is large compared to unity , then it is reasonable to expect that the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) are large compared to the term in eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) .",
    "this is because the number of contributions to the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) is proportional to @xmath152 . in this case , the transmission phase faithfully reflects the energy dependence of the resonance phase shift @xmath126 .",
    "deviations from this limit are of order @xmath153 . as we gradually turn off the coupling to the leads @xmath16 with @xmath134 , the terms  ( [ eq21 ] ) gradually vanish . nevertheless , it is possible  within experimental uncertainties that become ever more significant as the terms  ( [ eq21 ] ) become smaller  even in this case to determine the resonance phase shift @xmath126 from the data on the transmission phase .",
    "we propose the following procedure .",
    "add formulas  ( [ eq20 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) and fit the resulting expression to the data .",
    "this should allow a precise determination of @xmath126 and of @xmath79 also in cases where the coupling to the leads @xmath16 with @xmath134 is small .",
    "this statement holds with the proviso that the number of channels must be large enough to allow us to consider the total width @xmath79 as independent of @xmath0 . whenever the coupling to the leads @xmath16 with @xmath154 is small , the energy dependence of the transmission phase is quite different from that of the resonance phase shift",
    "nevertheless , the transmission phase @xmath2 does reflect the energy dependence of the resonance phase shift @xmath155 whenever the number of leads is larger than two .",
    "in particular , this energy dependence is governed by the total width @xmath79 .",
    "in conclusion , we have seen that in a theoretical model which is more closely patterned after the geometry of figure  [ fig1 ] than is the model of ref.@xcite , the transmission phase does reflect the value of the total width .",
    "this statement applies whenever the number of leads exceeds the value two , and whenever the total number of channels is large compared to one .",
