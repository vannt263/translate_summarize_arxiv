    "brownian fluctuation of multi - layer coatings on a mirror is a dominant noise source in interferometric gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "one way to reduce coating thermal noise is mechanical separation of the first few layers from the rest of the coatings  @xcite@xcite .",
    "this so - called khalili - cavity will be useful in precision measurements like the sub - sql measurement experiment  @xcite or a future - generation gravitational - wave detector like einstein telescope  @xcite@xcite . replacing a single mirror by a cavity",
    "will , however , increase the complexity of the system , and a way to ease this problem is to use an etalon instead of the double - mirror cavity . the front surface and the back surface of the etalon",
    "are not mechanically separated , but as we will show in this paper , the separation is good enough to reduce the noise level of the whole system better than a single conventional mirror .    figure  [ fig : mirror ] shows our model .",
    "the test mass is a cylindrical mirror made of silica and its motion is probed by an axisymmetric gaussian beam .",
    "both sides of the mirror are coated by silica - tantala doublets and the distance of the two surfaces is controlled to be anti - resonant for the carrier light utilizing the temperature dependence of the refractive index of the substrate",
    ". a larger fraction of the light is reflected back by the front surface but the thermal - noise level on the front surface is lower than that of the back surface because of the fewer coating layers .",
    "each surface of the etalon is probed less than a fully reflective surface of a conventional mirror ; the front surface of the etalon is probed by @xmath0 , and the back surface is probed by @xmath1 .",
    "total coating thermal noise of the etalon is the sum of noise on the front surface and noise on the back surface , which are caused by the thermal energy stored in the coating layers .",
    "in fact , it is not only the energy stored in the front ( back ) surface coatings that causes the phase fluctuation on the beam reflected at the front ( back ) surface of the etalon .",
    "the thermal energy stored in the coatings of the other surface contributes to the phase fluctuation on the beam via the substrate . for the etalon",
    ", we should thus consider four elements to calculate total coating thermal noise .",
    "one is the fluctuation of the front surface caused by the thermal energy in the front surface coatings .",
    "this process is the same as that of coating thermal noise of a conventional mirror .",
    "second is the fluctuation of the front surface caused by the thermal energy in the back surface coatings that is _ mechanically transferred _ to the front surface .",
    "the other two are the fluctuation of the back surface coatings caused by the thermal energy in the front surface coatings and that in the back surface coatings , which are probed by the beam transmitting through the substrate or in other words _ optically transferred _ to the front surface .",
    "the fluctuations caused by the thermal energy in the coatings of a same surface are correlated .    according to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ,",
    "the fluctuation caused by the thermal energy is given by calculating dissipation of the elastic energy caused by an imaginary force that is intentionally applied to the measured surface  @xcite@xcite .",
    "in the case of a conventional mirror , a single imaginary force is applied to the reflective front surface , and the elastic energy is integrated over the coatings on the surface . in the case of an etalon , an imaginary force shall be applied to each reflective plane with a weight coefficient @xmath2 , which is given from the response from the motion of each surface to the phase change of the reflected light .",
    "the elastic energy is then integrated over the coatings on both surfaces .",
    "the thermal - noise level is proportional to the dissipated power , which is given by the elastic energy multiplied by the mechanical loss angle .    to calculate the elastic energy of the etalon",

    "this is also true for the back surface coatings .",
    "the question is about the front surface coatings , but let us ignore the difference for the simplicity .",
    "this simplification is valid as the anti - resonant etalon accommodates little light circulating in it .",

    "in addition , the phase shift due to the motion of the front mirror from its initial position should be taken into account .",

    "there could be a better parameter set to realize more significant improvement by the compensation , but we shall leave this for a future work .          in this paper , we approximated the multi - layer coatings as a single thick layer of silica or tantala .",
    "this mono - layer approximation is used in ref .",
    "reference  @xcite explains that the stress tensor and the strain tensor of each layer are given by those of interface between the substrate and the neighboring layer if we assume the stress is equal within each thin layer , thus the square - sum of the elastic energy in each layer is equal to that of a single thick layer .",
    "this approach is based on the assumption that the light reflects on the first surface of the coatings and the light propagates without reflections in the coatings . while this assumption is a good approximation , the light is actually reflected on each boundary between the layers .",
    "each displacement @xmath145 of the @xmath146-th boundary of the layers contributes to the phase shift of the reflected light .",
    "the total displacement @xmath147 read out by the reflected beam is given as @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the coefficient that represents a contribution of each boundary . with this approach , recently demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the power spectrum of coating thermal noise for a conventional mirror can be corrected by a few percent . in the case of an etalon ,",
    "the correction of the power spectrum is more than the conventional mirror : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is calculated with the mono - layer approximation ( used in this paper ) and @xmath152 is calculated with this approach with multi - layers .",
    "in this paper we have shown a semi - analytical method to calculate coating thermal noise of an etalon , which can be used to lower the total thermal - noise level with the same reflectivity as a conventional mirror if we put a few coatings on the front surface and more on the back surface ( _ khalili etalon _ ) .",
    "we used the fluctuation - dissipation theorem with probes on both sides of the etalon so that the thermal motion due to the same dissipation source can be summed up coherently .",
    "the result revealed a strong dependence of the noise contribution on the thickness of the etalon .",
    "in fact , the noise level of the etalon can be as low as that of a separate 2-mirror system , if the etalon is sufficiently thick .",
    "the result was verified with numerical calculations by a finite - element analysis code .",
    "the deviation was less than 5  % below mechanical resonance of the mass .",
    "we also checked if it is possible to compensate thermal motions caused by the same dissipation by changing the resonant condition of the light in the etalon .",
    "the compensation is possible but the noise level actually increases due to the circulation of the light in the etalon .",
    "the khalili etalon has clear application , for example , in a future gravitational - wave detector .",
    "the method we developed can be used also to calculate thermal noise of partially transmissive optics like a beamsplitter . in the case one",
    "uses a separate - type khalili cavity  @xcite , instead of the etalon , our method is useful to calculate the influence of the back surface of the first mirror .",
    "there are several additional factors to be investigated before the khalili etalon is ready to be implemented in a future gravitational - wave detector .",
    "several other kinds of thermal noise will be added by the use of the etalon .",
    "the etalon parameters should be optimized according to the magnitude of other thermal noise . from the experimental side ,",
    "thermal lensing and light scattering might be a problem .",
    "these issues are out of scope of this paper but the investigation will be done in the near future  @xcite .",

    "in this appendix we derive eq .",
    "( [ eq : tot_noise ] ) with the parameter of mechanical transfer @xmath122 .",
    "we start with the application of forces @xmath153 to the front of the front coating and @xmath154 to the back surface of the substrate ( @xmath155 and @xmath156 in fig . [",
    "fig : mirror ] ) . due to the small spatial dimensions of the coatings we can assume stress and strain to be independent from the cylindrical axis in the coatings .",
    "this refers to a situation where the forces @xmath153 and @xmath154 are applied to the front and back surface of the substrate , respectively . in the approximation of thin coatings , the elastic response of the khalili etalon",
    "is calculated in this paper by neglecting their influence .",
    "then , a force acting on the front affects the back surface in exactly the same way as a force applied onto the back affects the front surface .",
    "finally , the elastic energy in the coatings is obtained via transition conditions at the substrate coating boundary ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : strain1 ] ) and ( [ eq : strain2 ] ) ) .",
    "the linearity of the elastic equations allows us to divide the situation with two applied forces into two problems with only one force acting .",
    "this results in the following expressions @xmath157 for the energy density at position @xmath158 due to force @xmath159 .",
    "if only force @xmath153 is acting on the front we obtain @xmath160 the same considerations for the force on the back @xmath154 leads to @xmath161 the coefficient @xmath122 represents the mechanical transfer of a force on one side of the etalon that increases / decreases the elastic energy of the coatings on the other side of the etalon .",
    "the symmetry of this problem is represented by the identical coefficient @xmath162 . but note the parameter @xmath123 breaks the symmetry of the system .",
    "this parameter is introduced due to the fact that the stress component @xmath96 is assumed to be zero in the back coating ( i.e. the force @xmath154 is acting on the boundary between substrate and coating ) in contrast to the front coating .",
    "examining thermal noise of the etalon demands knowledge of the dissipated energy in the coating , which depends on thickness and mechanical loss @xmath20 .",
    "we combine both effects into one averaged parameter @xmath163 for each coating @xmath158 .",
    "we arrive at the following expressions for the dissipated energies @xmath164 , @xmath165    to combine these two results to the case of energy loss with two applied forces leads to an interferometric term .",
    "stress and strain behave linearly with respect to the amplitude of the applied probes . but due to the spatial separation of the probe forces the associated energies will not add linearly .",
    "a close examination of the problem reveals an analogy to the model of the classical optical interferometry and finally yields @xmath166 in the above expressions @xmath125 and @xmath126 determine the strength of the superposition . due to the different conditions for @xmath96 in the front and",
    "back coatings the calculation of energies differs leading to a different parameter @xmath167 for the total energy of the front and back coating . also note the relation @xmath168 that limits the interval of possible energy values .",
    "the exact values depend on the solution of the elastic equations for the khalili etalon .",
    "we want to compare this result to the situation of a conventional mirror . for this purpose",
    "we virtually remove the back coating ( @xmath169 ) and only consider the front coating of the etalon .",
    "this leads to the case of only a single force on the front surface ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "because our calculation only considers the response of the substrate , we can use eq .",
    "( [ equ : ediss1 ] ) for this case , too .",
    "this yields the total dissipated energy @xmath170 the same considerations hold for a conventional mirror only consisting of the back coating . with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdt ] ) we can replace the dissipated energy by the noise spectrum and obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : tot_noise ] ) : @xmath171 @xmath172 and @xmath173 characterize the noise spectra of conventional mirrors possessing the etalon s front or back coating stack , respectively .    from eq .",
    "( [ equ : ediss1 ] ) it is clear how to determine the coefficient @xmath122 .",
    "integrating the energy on the front coatings for two situations is sufficient : calculate the dissipated energy of the front coating @xmath174 for a force applied ( a ) on the back surface ( @xmath175 , @xmath176 ) and ( b ) on the front surface ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) . dividing the result of ( a ) by the result of ( b ) gives the factor @xmath177 .",
    "if we repeat this procedure for the energy dissipation in the back coating we obtain @xmath178 .",
