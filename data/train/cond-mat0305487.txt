    "the properties of skyrmions in two - dimensional magnets and thin magnetic films have been widely investigated in last few decades .",

    "the main result of this work is the numerical evidence that the bubble domain of the 50 nm size initiated by a strong magnetic tip in a thin magnetic film shrinks into a very small , few nanometers metastable skyrmion . for this purpose",

    "strong localization of the skyrmion magnetic field makes possible to read the information stored by skyrmions if the distances between them and between them and empty spaces are more than @xmath234 , where @xmath36 is skyrmion radius .",
    "such a distance is sufficient to ensure that skyrmions do not perturb the magnetization around .",
    "limitations on exchange constants accepted in our work stem from the requirement of the skyrmion stability .",
