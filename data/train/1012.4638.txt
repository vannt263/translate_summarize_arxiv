    "experiments with polarized antinucleons may substantially add to our knowledge of the nucleon - antinucleon ( @xmath7 ) interaction .",
    "however , generating of polarized @xmath8 is a complex task .",
    "very recently it was proposed in ref.@xcite to produce polarized @xmath8 at @xmath6 colliders in the reaction @xmath9 . for longitudinal polarization of @xmath6 beams considered in ref.@xcite , helicity conservation in the annihilation along with",
    "the fact that @xmath10 pair is produced near the threshold mainly with zero angular momentum provide high polarization degree of nucleon and antinucleon .",
    "estimates done in ref.@xcite with parameters of @xmath11-factory reported in ref.@xcite show that it is possible to probe a spin - dependent part of the @xmath7 inelastic scattering cross section using appropriate polarized targets .",
    "the spin - dependent part of the proton - antiproton , @xmath12 , cross section is important at calculations of the polarization buildup rate in the @xmath13 beam interacting with a polarized target in a storage ring ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a recent renewal of interest in low - energy @xmath7 physics has been stimulated , in particular , by experimental investigation of the proton ( antiproton ) electric , @xmath2 , and magnetic , @xmath3 , form factors in the process @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "namely , it was found that the ratio @xmath15 strongly depends on @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the energy in the center - of - mass frame ) nearby the reaction threshold at @xmath18 .",
    "the most natural explanation of this phenomenon is final state interaction of the proton and antiproton , since a strong dependence at small @xmath19 addresses the interaction at distances much larger than @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , it is possible to use some phenomenological @xmath7 optical potentials for theoretical description of the process @xmath9 as well as of other processes at low energy ( see recent reviews @xcite ) .",
    "such potentials have many parameters which are determined by fitting existing experimental data .",
    "the imaginary part of these potentials is known worst of all . therefore , new data on @xmath7 annihilation , especially the spin data , may essentially upgrade quality of theoretical predictions .    in the present paper ,",
    "the paris @xmath7 optical potential suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and then upgraded in @xcite is applied to calculate @xmath2 and @xmath3 by the method used in @xcite .",
    "we use the latest version of the paris @xmath7 optical potential presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . having the form factors at disposal",
    ", we analyze the hadron polarization @xmath1 arising in the reaction @xmath9 for arbitrarily polarized @xmath6 beams .",
    "it is shown that both the ratio @xmath15 and the relative phase of the form factors @xmath21 can be extracted from data on @xmath22 and the differential cross section . in a wide energy range above the threshold ,",
    "the polarization degree is rather high for transversally and especially for longitudinally polarized beams .",
    "it turns out that the polarization is not too small even if both @xmath23 and @xmath24 beams are unpolarized .",
    "using a standard definition @xcite of the electromagnetic hadronic current , one easily obtains the differential cross section of @xmath25 annihilation in the center - of - mass frame @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the nucleon velocity , @xmath16 , and @xmath28\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the nucleon momentum , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the unit vector parallel to the collision axis ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 are polarizations of the @xmath24 and @xmath23 beam , respectively .",
    "the cross section ( [ cross ] ) is independent of the phase @xmath36 .",
    "small terms of the order of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the electron mass ) were neglected in obtaining ( [ cross ] ) . as a result , the quantity @xmath39 defined by eq.([tt ] ) vanishes along with the cross section if both @xmath35 and @xmath34 are collinear with @xmath33 and @xmath40 .",
    "so the expression([tt ] ) for @xmath39 is valid if @xmath41 .",
    "if a polarization of only one of the created particles ( nucleon or antinucleon ) is measured , the polarization vector @xmath1 reads @xmath42(\\bm \\nu\\cdot\\bm n)(1+\\bm \\zeta^-\\cdot\\bm \\zeta^+)+[\\bm n\\times\\bm \\zeta^+_\\perp ] ( \\bm \\zeta^-\\cdot\\bm n_\\perp)+[\\bm n\\times\\bm \\zeta^-_\\perp](\\bm \\zeta^+\\cdot\\bm n_\\perp)\\}\\nonumber\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 .",
    "since @xmath1 depends on the phase @xmath21 , measurement of the nucleon polarization along with the differential cross section allows one to pin down the complex function @xmath44 , that is to measure both @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    to find the polarization @xmath1 from eq.([zetan ] ) , one should first estimate the quantities @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    "here they are estimated using an approach described in detail in ref.@xcite , where the dirac form factors @xmath47 and @xmath48 were considered .",
    "the form factors @xmath2 and @xmath3 are expressed via dirac form factors by ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) relations : @xmath49 , @xmath50 . from these relations we have at the threshold @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the scheme of calculations is as follows .",
    "the bare form factors @xmath53 and @xmath54 are introduced which address a short - range interaction .",
    "they weakly depend on @xmath55 and can be considered as phenomenological constants in the vicinity of the threshold . starting with a seed set of these constants ,",
    "the dressed form factors @xmath56 are obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for the wave function of the @xmath4 system with the total spin one and isospin one or zero .",
    "the @xmath4 interaction is described by an optical potential . in that way",
    "the cross section of @xmath57 and @xmath58 production is expressed via bare form factors .",
    "the final set of constants @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath54 is that which provides the best fit to experimental data for these cross sections . using this scheme and the latest version of the paris optical potential @xcite",

    "the ratio @xmath59 was also calculated in ref.@xcite using the previous version @xcite of the paris optical potential .",
