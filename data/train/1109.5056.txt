    "ultraintense laser pulses can generate high energy protons when irradiating a thin foil target  @xcite .",

    "the laser pulse parameters , i.e. , pulse energy , peak intensity and pulse duration , are , however , currently not optimized for practical applications .",
    "the determination of scaling laws in both the characteristics of the accelerated ion beams itself and in the resulting fusion yield is crucial for such an optimization . in this respect , we restrict our study on the scaling laws of fusion yields derived empirically from the currently available experimental data .",
    "we do not consider the acceleration mechanism of rediation pressure acceleration  @xcite that could be important to obtain higher energy ion beams for the oncological proton(or hadron)-therapy  @xcite , because such a mechanism is not feasible at current technology . clarifying the scaling laws of the fusion yield promises to extend the result even to estimate fusion yield for not well - investigated nuclear reactions by means of the ultrahigh - intensity laser - matter interactions , e. g. , aneutronic fusion reactions  @xcite and deuteron - induced reactions  @xcite . especially deuteron - induced reactions are expected to induce enough yields for the radioactive isotope production for pet diagnostics using laser - induced ions . for the purpose of the radioactive isotope production for pet diagnostics , monochromatic ion beam with an energy as high as 200 mev for oncological hadron - therapy is not necessary .    on this issue , scaling laws of the maximum energy and conversion efficiency of laser - accelerated protons from thin foil targets",
    "have been studied  @xcite . when a laser of intensity higher than 10@xmath0  w/@xmath1 is irradiated on an aluminum foil target ,",
    "a simple power scaling of the form @xmath2 with @xmath3 is found  @xcite , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the maximum proton energy and the laser pulse intensity , respectively .",
    "more in general the maximum proton energy is derived also as a function of the laser power  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the conversion efficiency on the laser energy is found to be linear , as it is shown in fig . 2 in  @xcite .    the scaling feature of the accelerated protons is obviously reflected in the yield of the laser - induced nuclear reactions .",
    "the neutron yield in deuterium cluster explosions is found to scale as a function of the laser pulse energy  ( @xmath6 )  @xcite and it follows a quadratic power law dependence .",
    "the other examples are the @xmath7zn yield  @xcite and the @xmath8c yield  @xcite for the reactions @xmath7cu(@xmath9)@xmath7zn and @xmath8b(@xmath9)@xmath8c , respectively .",
    "both reactions are obtained with proton beams generated at the vulcan laser of the rutherford appleton laboratory  ( ral ) .",

    "the @xmath7zn and @xmath8c activities are determined by detecting the 0.51 mev @xmath10-rays .",
    "the @xmath7zn activity shows again a quadratic power dependence on the laser pulse energy ( fig . 3 in  @xcite ) .",
    "the above mentioned experiments use different types of primary targets : solid - aluminum foils and deuterated clusters .",
    "the mechanisms of the ion acceleration from these targets are thought to be not unique , i.e. , in the case of the foil targets , the target normal sheath acceleration  ( tnsa ) mechanism  @xcite is responsible for the ion acceleration . within this mechanism electrons on the target",
    "laser - irradiated surface are accelerated by the laser pulse in the direction of the laser propagation .",
    "the electrons pass through the target , ionizing the surface contaminants , and form a sheath on the rear surface .",
    "the charge separation due to the motion of electrons causes the electrostatic field which accelerates the protons in the surface contaminants . while , in the case of deuterated cluster target irradiation , the deuteron - acceleration is attributed to the bound - electron expulsions from the clusters by laser - irradiations  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the obtained experimental data on the fusion yield show a similar quadratic dependence on the laser pulse energy . two characteristic commons to those experiments",
    "are the spectra of the accelerated ions which have a maxwellian - like shape  @xcite and the fact that the fusion reaction occurs in the beam - target mechanism  @xcite .",
    "these data have not been investigated comprehensively , because of the apparent difference in the ion acceleration mechanisms . in this paper",
    "we analyze these data assuming hydrodynamic scaling  @xcite and show that the scaling laws in fusion yields can be explained inclusively . for this purpose",
    "we reformulate the scaling of proton acceleration found in the maximum proton energy and the conversion efficiency  @xcite .",
    "these two features are related with the temperature , i.e. , the width of the maxwellian - like spectra , of the accelerated ions and the total number of the accelerated ions : both scale as functions of the laser power .",
    "these two parameters are , indeed , more fundamental than the maximum proton energy in the sense of characterizing the energy spectra of the accelerated ions and estimating the nuclear reaction rate , as is described in  [ sec : rrppa ] . in this context",
    "we stress the importance of determining the plasma temperature for the yield evaluation .",
    "we begin with the scaling features of the neutron yield from deuterium cluster explosions , which indeed motivated us studying the scaling of the yield from laser - induced nuclear - reactions .",
