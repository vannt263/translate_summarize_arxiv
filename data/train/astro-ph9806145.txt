    "the study of high - redshift galaxies and clusters is interesting because the light we see from them was emitted when galaxies and clusters were billions of years younger , and likely very different , than they are today . since deep field galaxy surveys have only begun to identify large numbers of @xmath9@xmath101 galaxies ( @xcite ) , it is useful to seek other efficient methods to find galaxies and clusters at @xmath101 .",
    "one such possible method is to look for galaxies associated with quasars , specifically radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) .",
    "radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) are rarely found in clusters at any redshift , but @xmath1135% of intrinsically luminous ( m@xmath12@xmath13@xmath1425 ) rlqs are located in clusters of abell richness class 01 ( and occasionally 2 ) at @xmath9=0.50.7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , little work has previously been done on rlq environments at @xmath100.7 .",
    "some rlqs show possible additional evidence for being located in rich environments , in the form of an excess number of `` associated ''  ( @xcite ) or 2  ( @xcite ) absorption systems .",
    "( for our purposes we define `` associated absorption '' to mean  or 2  systems located within @xmath155000  km  s@xmath16 of the quasar redshift . )",
    "these systems may arise in gas expelled at high velocity from the quasars or in galaxies in clusters at or near the quasar redshifts . in the last few years high - resolution keck spectra",
    "have shown that some associated  systems are unlike the typical intervening  absorption systems .",
    "these `` intrinsic '' systems show unusually smooth and broad line profiles , or well - resolved optically thick but shallow lines indicating partial coverage of the background emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "variability has also been seen in a few cases ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . associated  absorbers with these characteristics are almost certainly produced by gas associated with the quasar central engine .",
    "it is also possible that the excess associated 2  absorbers of aldcroft , bechtold & elvis ( 1994 ) are intrinsic to their low - luminosity steep - radio - spectrum sample , since it is the only sample to date to show an excess of associated 2 .",
    "however , as the number of quasars with associated absorption which have been studied in detail is small , it remains possible that a substantial fraction of such quasars reside in clusters which produce associated absorption .    in 1994",
    "we embarked upon a project to extend studies of quasar environments beyond @xmath110.6 .",
    "the goals of this project are to study the environments of rlqs from @xmath9=0.62.0 , to study the correlation , if any , between rlq environment and other quasar properties such as the presence of associated absorption , and to study any examples of high - redshift galaxies and/or clusters found in high - redshift rlq fields .",
    "to study galaxies at redshifts @xmath9@xmath100.6 requires deep imaging , preferably in the rest - frame optical and near - ir where galaxies emit most of their stellar light .",
    "thus this project used  band ( 2.02.3@xmath17 m ) imaging to sample the rest - frame near - ir at the quasar redshifts , supplemented by gunn @xmath18 ( 0.60.7@xmath17 m ) imaging to sample the rest - frame near - uv .",
    "early - type galaxies which formed at @xmath9@xmath192 will have very red colors in @xmath20  at @xmath9@xmath101 , which helps to distinguish any clustering around the quasars from the field galaxy population .",
    "this paper discusses our observations for a study of rlq environments at @xmath9=12 .",
    "a = 0.61 sample will be presented in a future paper . in  [ sample ]",
    "we outline the selection of targets , in  [ datared ]",
    "we discuss the observations and the data reduction and analysis techniques used , and in  [ systematics ] we compare the galaxy counts in our fields to those in random fields . in paper 2 ( @xcite )",
    "we examine the properties of galaxies in = 12 rlq fields , present the evidence for an excess population of faint galaxies which are plausibly associated with the quasars , and discuss the properties of these candidate high - redshift galaxies and clusters .",
    "our quasar sample was designed to cover the redshift range @xmath9=0.62.0 fairly evenly , to contain comparable numbers of flat- and steep - radio - spectrum sources and sources of various radio morphologies , and to span a similar range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , allowing us to study how environment correlates with such properties at a given redshift and thus disentangle such effects from redshift evolution .",
    "we preferentially selected objects with known high-@xmath9 intervening absorption properties , giving even more preference to objects with few such absorbers , to reduce confusion about with which system any detected excess galaxies are associated .",
    "the sample was split into three redshift ranges .",
    "the @xmath9=0.61.0 subsample was intended to extend previous quasar environment studies ( which reached z@xmath110.60.7 ) to the highest redshift feasible using the steward 61@xmath21 and 90@xmath21 telescopes .",
    "data and analysis for this subsample will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the @xmath9=1.42.0 subsample was selected to feasibly allow investigation of intrinsic  absorption systems with the kpno 4-m telescope .",
    "the @xmath9=1.01.4 subsample was selected to link the low- and high - redshift samples to provide a view of quasar environments over the entire redshift range @xmath9=0.62.0 .",
    "figure [ fig_zg1_z ] shows the redshift histogram of the @xmath9@xmath101 quasars .      in order to study the dependence of environment on as many factors as possible , in each redshift subsample we desired to span a similar range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and to have an even split between flat and steep radio spectrum sources and between objects of different radio morphologies .",
    "radio properties are given in table [ tab_rad ] .",
    "steep radio spectrum sources were defined as having @xmath22@xmath230.5 , where @xmath24 ( @xcite ) .",
    "radio spectral indices were taken from stickel ( personal communication ) or from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) . radio flux densities @xmath25 at 5  ghz were also taken from ned , and were converted to the radio power ( luminosity ) at 5  ghz rest frequency using @xmath22 and assuming isotropic emission .",
    "figure [ fig_pradz ] is a graph of  vs. @xmath9 for the @xmath9@xmath101 objects .",
    "the average  is 27.41@xmath150.57 for the @xmath9=11.4 sample , and 27.56@xmath150.36 for the @xmath9=1.42.0 sample , so they are well matched . however , because radio emission is not always isotropic ( e.g. in the case of beaming ) , and again because radio variability affected both the measured @xmath25 and @xmath22 , our values of  should be considered representative only .      in this subsample",
    "we tried to exclude quasars with known associated and/or intervening 2  or , although in practice not many objects in our sample in this redshift range have been surveyed for absorption of either kind .",
    "candidate objects for this redshift range were rlqs from the large bright quasar survey ( @xcite ) , 1  jy rlqs ( @xcite ) with existing @xmath27 images obtained by stickel , and hst qsoals key project targets ( @xcite ) , supplemented with rlqs from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which had little or no absorption along the line of sight . due to poor weather",
    ", the final sample of observed @xmath9=1.01.4 quasars consists of only 12 objects : 5 flat - spectrum , 6 steep - spectrum , and 1 of unknown radio spectral slope .",

    "three objects are known not to have associated absorption , and one is ; the rest have no published associated absorption information .",
    "this subsample is further divided in two : the `` absorbed '' subsample of quasars with associated  absorption of rest - frame equivalent width ( rew ) @xmath101.5    within 5000  km  s@xmath16 of the quasar emission redshift z@xmath28 and the `` unabsorbed '' subsample of quasars without such absorption .",
    "we selected targets from the unpublished radio - loud survey of foltz _ et al _ , targets with z@xmath29@xmath10z@xmath28 absorption as listed by @xcite , and targets from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "targets were prioritized based on lack of high - redshift intervening absorption and having  and  in a range comparable to targets in the unabsorbed subsample .",
    "the unabsorbed subsample contains quasars at @xmath9=1.42.0 with no  absorption of any strength within 5000  km  s@xmath16 of @xmath30 .",
    "quasars with known associated 2  absorption were also excluded as a precaution .",
    "targets were selected from the catalogs of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , based on the same criteria as the absorbed subsample .",
    "the presence of intervening 2  absorption systems was considered less problematic than  because the work of steidel , dickinson & persson ( 1994 ) shows that intervening 2  absorbers can be statistically identified and excluded from the analysis , even at these high redshifts .",
    "the final sample of observed @xmath9=1.42.0 quasars is given in table [ tab_zg1 ] and consists of 21 quasars : 8 flat - spectrum and 13 steep - spectrum ; 14 with and 7 without associated  absorption .",

    "to aid in the reduction of infrared array data , a collection of routines collectively entitled phiirs ( pat hall s infrared imaging reduction system ) was developed to work within iraf .",
    "phiirs is available at the world wide web url _ http://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/web/contrib.html _ or by contacting the first author . in general , `` standard '' data reduction techniques for infrared arrays were used ( e.g. cowie _ et  al .",
    "the specific routines used are in some cases directly derived from those in the dimsum package ( stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1995 ) which is also available from the www url given above .",
    "a brief outline of the steps used to reduce infrared array data follows .",
    "\\1 ) nonlinearity correction ( irim data only ) .",
    "\\2 ) dark subtraction .",
    "\\3 ) first - pass flattening , using a  running skyflat \" or domeflats .",
    "\\4 ) first - pass sky subtraction , using a  running sky \" .",
    "\\5 ) determination of image shifts and first - pass coadding .",
    "\\6 ) creation of individual - image object masks out of coadded image .",
    "\\7 ) second pass flattening ( unless domeflats were used ) and sky subtraction using object masking and photometric scaling .",
    "\\8 ) cosmic ray removal ( optional ) .",
    "\\9 ) make and apply throughput correction to account for light reaching the detector without being focussed by the telescope ( steward 61@xmath39 and 90@xmath39 only ) .",
    "\\10 ) rotate and resample from different observing runs or telescopes to a common scale ( if necessary ) .",
    "\\11 ) coadd second - pass ( and possibly rotated ) images with 2x2 pixel resampling .",
    "\\12 ) calculate appropriate scaling factors for nonphotometric data and re - coadd .",
    "\\13 ) remove low - level striping from coadded image , if necessary ( irim only ) .",
    "\\14 ) photometric calibration .",
    "where necessary , the reduction steps are now discussed in detail .      to correct for nonlinearity in the kpno irim array at high signal levels , sequences of varying exposure time images of the illuminated flatfield screen was taken through a narrow 2.2@xmath17 m filter during each run .",
    "a fit was made to the observed dark - subtracted signal versus the expected signal extrapolated from low light levels , accounting for the delay between biasing and the first ( non - destructive ) read of the array , when the array is accumulating charge which is not reflected in the final output value for each pixel .",
    "the fits were consistent between runs , so the results from all runs were combined to find a nonlinearity correction which was applied to all images .      the  running sky \" method of flattening and/or sky - subtracting was first described by cowie _",
    "et  al . _",
    "each image of the field , offset by a few arcseconds from the others , is first flattened using a median of the raw images taken immediately before and after it , and then sky - subtracted using a median of the flattened versions of the same images .",
    "( the order of these two operations can be reversed . )",
    "typically 8 images total , 4 before and 4 after , were used ( 20 or 22 for nsfcam ) .    running sky - subtraction",
    "was used for all data , but domeflattening was used for irim and nsfcam data . using running skyflats alone or along with",
    "domeflats gave similar results of rms noises @xmath1110% higher than domeflats alone .",
    "this is probably because domeflats were typically constructed from a set of images with total signal @xmath1120% higher than the skyflats .",
    "extensive experimentation was done to determine the optimal parameters for coadding the data such that cosmic rays and other bad pixels were excluded , the photometry of both bright and faint objects was not significantly different from a simple average , and the rms noise of the output image was as low as possible , to optimize the detection of faint objects .",
    "the weights used to make the final coadded image were the  optimal weights \" of each 2 ) and the images coadded using integer shifts in units of these new pixels .    our detection algorithm requires a constant rms noise across the image ( see  [ focas ] ) . thus along with each coadded image",
    "an exposure map was created , giving the total exposure time at each pixel assuming a constant sky background during the observations , at each pixel the coadded image will have rms noise proportional to ( exposure time)@xmath40 , i.e. higher at the edges of the image where the exposure time was less . by multiplying the square root of the exposure map image by the coadded image ,",
    "the coadded image is normalized to constant rms noise .",
    "however , when the sky background varies and the rms noise does not scale as ( exposure time)@xmath40 , a more elaborate method must be used to construct the normalization image ; see  [ optcoadd ] .      when running flatfielding and/or sky - subtraction is used , small negative residuals in the final coadded image are present around the position of each such object , in the pattern of the dithering used to make the observations , because faint objects are not completely excluded when the median is determined .",
    "these residuals are eliminated by masking out objects detected in the first - pass coadd and making a second pass .    to make this object mask image , each first - pass coadded image was normalized to uniform pixel - to - pixel rms using the square root of the exposure map .",
    "the normalized image was boxcar smoothed and pixels above @xmath115 times the smoothed - image rms noise were flagged as objects , along with rings of width one pixel around these flagged pixels .",
    "individual - image object masks were then copied from the coadded - image mask using the known offsets of each image .",
    "these masks were used in the second - pass flatfielding and sky - subtraction , and the second - pass images were used to make the final coadd .",
    "since we wish to detect the faintest objects possible , we need to coadd many infrared images , possibly taken at very different airmasses .",
    "thus it was decided to incorporate airmass corrections as multiplicative scalings to the individual images before coadding .",
    "our  extinction coefficient was either 0027 or 0120 per airmass , ( see  [ photkpno ] ) , so corrections applied to different images typically differ by @xmath13005 and always by @xmath13012 .",
    "as is usual , our magnitudes and fluxes represent exoatmospheric values , i.e. values at zero airmass .",
    "it should be noted that the extinction coefficient derived from observations at airmasses @xmath101 _ underestimates _ the extinction which occurs at airmasses @xmath131 , i.e. in the upper atmosphere ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the forbes effect : light at wavelengths with large monochromatic extinction coefficients is removed at small ( @xmath131 ) airmasses , leaving primarily light at wavelengths with smaller monochromatic extinction coefficients at airmasses @xmath101 .",
    "the forbes effect is small in the optical but strong in the ir due to the many h@xmath41o absorption lines . to avoid potential systematic errors ,",
    "carefully designed photometric passbands should be used ( @xcite ) .",
    "nonphotometric data were scaled to photometric data on the same field by identifying several relatively bright objects ( excluding the quasars whenever possible ) in the coadded image of all data on the field .",
    "photometry was then performed on these objects in the individual images , discarding objects which fell on bad pixels .",
    "the relative scalings and weights for each image were then interactively examined and adjusted as necessary .",
    "also , at this point , if necessary , data from different detector / telescope combinations with different zeropoints were multiplicatively scaled to a common zeropoint .",
    "this results in a higher weighting for data from more efficient detector / telescope combinations .",
    "the images were then re - coadded with these adjusted scalings and weights , yielding a coadded image calibrated to the photometric data in the field .      on some 4-meter irim images ,",
    "a pattern of  striping \" is evident .",
    "this pattern is fixed on the sky but varies from field to field , so it is thought to be caused by scattered light from bright stars well out of the field of view ( m. dickinson , personal communication ) .",
    "subtraction of smoothed versions of the object - masked images removed this pattern . running this procedure on images which showed no striping showed that it did not introduce any systematic error in the photometry , but simply increased the photometric uncertainties by at most @xmath115% .",
    "instrument rotations relative to n - s on the sky are not exactly the same between runs and telescopes .",
    "thus the images from each separate filter or observing run were first coadded independently , and these coadded images were used to determine the rotations between different observing runs or filters , as well as the relative pixel scale between different telescopes ( see  [ resample ] ) .",
    "typically the rotation was @xmath421 degree , and the maximum observed value was @xmath113 degrees .",
    "one set of  images for each field was arbitrarily taken to have an angle of zero relative to true north , so the angle of the coordinate systems in these fields are expected to be good to only @xmath151 degree rms .",
    "when images are rotated with linear interpolation , a gridlike pattern is evident on the final image , caused by the differing noise characteristics in regions where pixels are linear combinations of several original pixels .",
    "rather than rotating the final coadd and having such a pattern present , cosmic - ray cleaned images were rotated with linear interpolation before coadding , despite the low s / n of the individual frames , so that the patterns on individual images were averaged over in producing the final coadd .",
    "all data in @xmath35 and @xmath36 was resampled to the  pixel scale .",
    "the final ir images have half the  pixel scale , or 0.3015/pixel , since they have been expanded 2x2 for better registration during coadding (  [ coadd ] ) .",
    "the resampling was done in the same step as the rotation , on the cosmic - ray cleaned images .",
    "observations in the gunn _",
    "r _ band were made for almost all z@xmath101 targets observed in the  band .",
    "a few fields were observed in the @xmath43 , @xmath33 , and @xmath9 bands .",
    "standard reduction procedures for ccd data were used .",
    "additional tasks for interactively removing fringes and for coadding optical images in an accurate manner were developed to work within iraf .",
    "a package containing these tasks , entitled phat ( pat hall s add - on tasks ) , is available at the www url _ http://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/web/contrib.html _ or by contacting the author .",
    "the overall philosophy of the optical reductions is our desire for extracting realistic magnitudes and errors over the maximum area and depth possible from our imaging data .",
    "extensive experimentation was done at all steps of the reduction process .",
    "one important point is that we found no method to reliably coadd images with substantial seeing variations and reject cosmic rays without rejecting valid pixels in the cores and/or wings of many objects and affecting photometry at the @xmath115% level .",
    "( mcleod ( 1994 ) also experienced this problem ) .",
    "thus we removed cosmic rays before coadding .",

    "\\10 ) calculate appropriate scaling factors for nonphotometric data and re - coadd .",
    "\\11 ) photometric calibration .    where necessary , the reduction steps are discussed in detail below .",
    "twilight flats were often used to improve the domeflattening . for the steward",
    "800x1200 ccd , and occasionally the 2kx2k ccd , it was necessary to also use sky flats from disregistered images taken at each position .",
    "even then , some 800x1200 images showed gradients of up to 5% .",
    "the worst of these images were discarded , but in the interests of reaching the faintest magnitudes , images flat to only a few percent were sometimes used in producing the final coadds .",
    "data taken in @xmath9 and some @xmath43 filters showed considerable fringing .",
    "fringe images were created by medianing affected frames together and subtracting a heavily smoothed background . the fringe image",
    "was then scaled and subtracted from the affected images , using an iterative procedure until satisfactory results were obtained .",
    "bright scattered light was sometimes subtracted from individual object - masked images using a similar procedure . other , fainter scattered light was masked out using the very useful iraf task xray.ximages.plcreate .      as with the infrared images , we chose to remove extinction by scaling the individual images to a common airmass rather than determining a mean airmass for the final coadded image .",
    "see  [ photcal ] for a discussion of the photometric calibration and determination of the extinction coefficients .      unlike the near - ir images , where the fwhm of stellar images was 23 pixels ( at a pixel scale of 0.6/pixel or larger ) , in the optical images ( 0.3/pixel ) the fwhm was often 5 pixels or more .",
    "the optical images also were taken over longer time spans , almost always including data from different nights , resulting in greater seeing variations between images .",
    "no method could be found to reliably coadd images with substantial seeing variations and reject cosmic rays without rejecting valid pixels in the cores and/or wings of many objects and affecting photometry at the @xmath115% level ( mcleod ( 1994 ) also experienced this problem ) .",
    "such a method is possible when two or more images are taken at the same position , e.g. crrej in stsdas . in principle",
    "this task could be adopted to cope with dithered images , but for our optical images cosmic rays were always removed prior to coadding .",
    "the best method we found for removing cosmic rays was a slightly modified version of the dimsum task xzap ( @xcite ) .",
    "the procedure was to subtract off a median - smoothed version of the image , identify the peaks on the resultant image as cosmic rays , and replace them on the original image with the median of the surrounding pixels .",
    "typically a first pass was made using an object mask and a second pass without object masking but with a more restrictive cosmic ray detection criterion . visual inspection and editing",
    "was done to remove the few obvious cosmic rays which survived the automated removal .",
    "the optical images were then coadded with a simple averaging and minimal ( or no ) pixel rejection .",
    "another difference between coadding infrared and optical data arises from the variable sky level in the optical .",
    "the sky background is higher in the infrared , but its variability at  is usually not extreme .",
    "however , variable night sky emission lines are present in the @xmath43 and @xmath9 bands , and the presence of the moon or of thin cirrus can affect the sky brightness in the optical on a short timescale , a problem exacerbated by the fewer number of optical images available for coadding . because the sky level ( and thus the rms ) varies between individual images , the coadded - image rms no longer scales with the exposure time at each pixel .",
    "thus instead of multiplying by the square root of the exposure time to normalize the image , it is necessary to multiply by the inverse of the expected rms for each pixel .",
    "this normalization map was constructed by creating individual normalization images with a constant pixel value equal to the measured image variance , and then coadding together these images using a weighted average and offsets identical to those used to make the coadded image .",
    "optical observations of a few fields were obtained somewhat differently from most fields .",

    "prior to running object detection software on the final coadded images , several important steps must be taken to ensure easy production and calibration of accurate output catalogs .      first ,",
    "the photometrically calibrated final coadded images of each field in each filter are normalized to uniform rms pixel - to - pixel noise using the exposure or normalization maps , as appropriate ( see  [ coadd ] and  [ optcoadd ] ) .",
    "the images have already been rotated and resampled onto the same coordinate system ( see  [ rotate ] ,  [ resample ] and  [ optoutline ] ) ; they are now shifted to a common origin .",
    "the images are then masked so that only areas with a certain minimum exposure time ( typically 0.25 times the maximum exposure time in the coadded image ) are included in the trimmed image .",
    "pixels outside such regions are set to zero . for fields with images in multiple filters ,",
    "the images are masked to exclude pixels where any image has been set to zero .",
    "for these trimmed images with uniform rms , the detection significance of objects is constant across the image , i.e. , a 3@xmath55 detection is a 3@xmath55 detection regardless of location on the image .",
    "however , the magnitude scale and thus the limiting magnitude is not constant across the 1 to achieve constant rms .",
    "this complication is worth overcoming , as this procedure increases the useful area of our coadded images by about a factor of 2 compared to the standard procedure of using only the area with maximum exposure , because of the small sizes of the ir arrays and ccds used .",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1994 ) and bershady , lowenthal & koo employed similar techniques for object detection , although not for photometry .",
    "another approach to the same problem is to modify object detection programs to handle spatially varying rms noise , e.g. focas ( @xcite ) or sextractor ( @xcite ) .",
    "once a catalog of objects is generated , the true magnitudes are computed by taking the central pixel of each object , determining the factor by which that pixel was multiplied to make the normalized image , and correcting the object s magnitude to account for this factor .",
    "a similar procedure is used to calculate the area of sky surveyed as a function of limiting magnitude .",
    "we are interested in galaxies detected in even just a single filter and wish to study such galaxies properties consistently ( i.e. within the same aperture ) in all filters .",
    "in particular , we are interested in objects in the @xmath9@xmath101 quasar fields detected only in the near - ir .",
    "thus we created a summed @xmath18 +  image ( or @xmath18+@xmath35 +  where good @xmath35 data was available ) in each field . to give each filter s image equal weight at the faintest magnitudes ,",
    "all the input images were normalized to the same rms before summing .",
    "it is possible that an object detected just at the detection limit in one filter could fall below the detection limit in the summed image , since the summing would effectively just be adding noise to such a galaxy .",
    "we used the focas task clean to replace the isophotal area of all catalogued objects in the individual filter images with random sky values , and then inspected the images visually .",
    "typically only one or two faint ( @xmath135@xmath55 ) blue galaxy candidates were overlooked in each field .",
    "the candidates were often smaller than the minimum area or were classified as `` noise , '' and the number of such candidates was consistent with the number of noise spikes seen by displaying the negative side of the sky histogram .",
    "we chose not to smooth the images to the same psf before summing and determing isophotes for photometry , despite its attractiveness for matching isophotes in different filters and reducing noise to assist in faint object detection .",
    "tests of smoothing using iraf immatch.psfmatch and focas showed that there was a systematic shift in the magnitudes of objects after smoothing , such that the objects were apparently fainter in the smoothed image .",
    "the shift was magnitude - dependent : fainter objects had a larger magnitude offset .",
    "this is understandable since smoothing will reduce noise , and at the faintest levels objects are difficult to distinguish from noise . it might be possible to avoid this bias for e.g. @xmath105@xmath55 objects by using a smaller convolution kernel than the 15@xmath3815 pixel ( @xmath114.5@xmath384.5 ) box we used , or by simply matching the fwhm of different images instead of the complete psf shape as we attempted .",
    "object detection , classification , and photometry was performed with focas ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we used the built - in smoothing filter and required all detected pixels ( in the smoothed image ) to be at least 2.5 times the iterative image rms above sky .",
    "we required initial detections to have a minimum area of 21 pixels ( 1.9 arcsec@xmath57 ) , although during the splitting phase a reduced criterion of 10 pixels was used to better separate overlapping objects .",
    "these values are appropriate for our typical seeing conditions . for fields where the 2.5@xmath58 limit resulted in too many spurious detections",
    ", we retroactively excluded objects less than 3@xmath58 above sky . for a handful of fields with spurious pixel - to - pixel correlations from destriping of subpixel resampling and shifting , or with poor seeing , focas was rerun with a larger mininum area .",
    "these detection criteria adjustments were carefully chosen to ensure that they eliminated no obviously real objects down to our 5@xmath55 detection limits , and a negligible number to our 3@xmath55 limits .      to isolate the galaxies in our fields from noise and stars as best as possible , we broke object classification down into several steps .",

    "such changes should have negligible effects on star or galaxy counts .",
    "the isophotes from the summed - image focas catalog for each field were used to create catalogs for each individual filter , so that each object is measured within the same area in all filters .",
    "focas total magnitudes ( see next paragraph ) are not expected to be affected by the small differences between psfs in the summed and individual images ; we have verified this by running focas directly on the individual images .",
    "images not used to make the summed image typically had worse seeing than those which were . nonetheless , we still used the summed - image focas total magnitude isophotes for these images .",
    "the same tests as above showed scatter consistent with photometric errors alone and no systematic errors in these cases as well , except for the @xmath35-band observations of q  2345 + 061 ( 268 seeing ) .    for our magnitudes we used focas total magnitudes , which have been shown to be unbiased estimates of the true magnitudes of unresolved and gaussian - profile objects ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "focas total magnitudes are derived by growing each object s original detection isophote until it doubles in size and then measuring the flux above the local sky in this aperture .",
    "we make a minor correction to the focas total magnitudes for split objects , whose total magnitudes are derived by apportioning the original object s total counts among the split objects according to their isophotal areas .",
    "this does not take surface brightnesses into account . a bright star and a low surface brightness galaxy with equal isophotal areas will have erroneous magnitudes ( too low and too high , respectively ) if they were originally detected as one object and later split by focas .",
    "also , the detection isophote can be rather bright for objects very close together which were barely split by focas , leaving considerable flux outside it to be apportioned with the same problems as above .    to better estimate the total magnitudes of split objects , we examine the difference between their total and isophotal magnitudes on the summed image , @xmath60 and @xmath62 . as seen in figure [ fig_datared5 ] , objects which were never split have low values of ( @xmath62@xmath14@xmath60)/@xmath63 where @xmath63 is the uncertainty of the total magnitude @xmath60 ( see next paragraph ) .",
    "however , at bright magnitudes the uncertainties from photon statistics are quite small , and so this quantity is sensitive to erroneous estimates of @xmath60 .",
    "thus we empirically identified objects with ( @xmath62@xmath14@xmath60)/@xmath63@xmath1010 and ( @xmath62@xmath14@xmath60)@xmath1003 as objects whose @xmath60 values are affected by splitting . for these objects we replaced the total counts @xmath64 with @xmath64=@xmath52 + 1.5@xmath38@xmath65 , where @xmath52 is the isophotal counts ( in adu ) and @xmath65 is the uncertainty of the focas total magnitude , in adu ( see next paragraph ) .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig_datared5 ] , this approximates the average `` aperture correction '' of @xmath111.5@xmath63 between @xmath64 and @xmath52 for objects which were never split more accurately than a fixed value would ( compare figure [ fig_datared5]a and b ) .",
    "we have also replaced the total counts with the isophotal counts in cases where the total counts were smaller , since the total magnitude should be brighter .",
    "we thank the referee for pointing out that such cases are expected since the total magnitude will have a larger uncertainty due to its larger aperture .",
    "thus our correction has introduced a statistical bias to brighter magnitudes .",
    "however , only a small percentage of objects are affected ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_datared5]a ) and so the estimated effect of the bias is an erroneous brightwards shift in our magnitude bin centers of only 001003 .",
    "this shift is not enough to significantly change any of our conclusions , so we have not recalculated all our magnitudes at this time .",
    "we plan to make our catalogs public in a future paper , and will correct this error at that time .    after these corrections to the focas total counts",
    "were made , total magnitudes were calculated from them .",

    "the average 3@xmath55 limiting magnitude was estimated for each filter from the magnitude - error graph before correction for rms normalization (  [ trim ] ) .",
    "magnitudes fainter than this limit were set to the limiting value .",
    "the true normalization - corrected magnitudes were then computed by determining the factor by which the central pixel of the object was multiplied to make the normalized image , and adjusting the object magnitude ( or 3@xmath55 limit ) appropriately .",
    "this assumes that the exposure time does not vary dramatically over the size of a typical object .",
    "we take the color excess  from burstein & heiles ( 1978 , 1982 ) and @xmath69 from mihalas & binney ( 1981 ) .",

    "for each field , the individual filter catalogs were used to construct a catalog of objects with a @xmath233@xmath55 detection within the focas total magnitude aperture in either the @xmath18 , , or ( when available ) @xmath35 filters .",
    "this is the faintest feasible catalog limit , since unresolved objects at the 3@xmath55 limit have only a @xmath1150% chance of detection ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use our  3@xmath55 catalog \" to compare n(m ) counts with the literature .",
    "however , for reliable comparative studies of galaxy colors and counts between our different fields , this catalog was found to include too many spurious objects , since a spurious object in any filter becomes part of the catalog whereas most real objects are common to all catalogs .",
    "in addition , the errors on the colors become very large for objects below 5@xmath55 .",
    "thus for most of our science we used a ",
    "5@xmath55 catalog , \" consisting of all objects in the 3@xmath55 catalog brighter than the average 5@xmath55 @xmath71 limit in each field .",
    "this catalog is essentially magnitude limited ; but as long as the exposure time at the edges is @xmath2336% of the maximum , the average 5@xmath55 @xmath71 magnitude limit will be greater than the 3@xmath55 detection limit across the entire field .",
    "we now consider several points of importance in understanding the reliability of our catalogs before making use of them scientifically .    _",
    "( 1 ) are our magnitudes and colors correct and on a system directly comparable to published data ? _ as mentioned in ",
    "[ phot ] , focas total magnitudes have been shown to be robust estimators of the true magnitudes of most types of faint galaxies , with the exception of large , low surface brightness objects near the detection limit",
    ". however , see  [ systematics ] for a discussion of possible systematic errors in photometric calibration in our work and the literature .    _ ( 2 ) how many spurious objects are contained in the catalogs ? _ we interactively removed obviously spurious objects in the halos and diffraction spikes of bright stars .",
    "faint cosmic rays may make some objects spuriously bright , but the cosmic ray rate and our flux threshold for identifying them are both low enough that this should be a neglible effect .",
    "misclassified stars will contaminate the galaxy catalog below our star - galaxy classification limit .",
    "the contamination from stars is relatively small at faint magnitudes , but our fields are scattered over a wide range of galactic latitude and longitude ( see table [ tab_zg1 ] ) and so stellar contamination can not be ignored .",
    "we address the statistical subtraction of faint star counts from our fields in  [ sky ] .",
    "we make no correction for truly spurious objects in our @xmath72 catalogs .",
    "we reject objects classified as `` noise '' or `` long '' by focas , and simulations ( @xcite ) and observations by other researchers ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have shown that contamination by spurious objects in single - filter data is @xmath425% at the 3@xmath55 magnitude limit for the default focas detection threshold , decreasing to essentially zero at the 5@xmath55 limiting magnitude .",
    "thus we expect that essentially no @xmath105@xmath55 objects are spurious , and that at most @xmath4210% of objects in our 3@xmath55 catalog with magnitudes fainter than the 5@xmath55 limit are spurious ( @xmath4215% for the four fields with @xmath35 data ) .",
    "_ ( 3 ) how many real galaxies do we miss , as a function of magnitude ? _ galaxies can be overlooked due to magnitude errors scattering them below our detection limits , due to crowding , and due to misclassification as noise or `` long '' objects by focas or as bright stars by the r parameter .",
    "misclassification is unlikely to exclude a significant number of galaxies ( see  [ sum ] ) .",
    "thus by the _ completeness _ of our galaxy catalogs we refer to only the effects of crowding and magnitude errors .    the most sophisticated way to calculate the completeness is to calculate the completeness matrix @xmath73 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which gives the probabilities @xmath74 that a galaxy of true magnitude @xmath62 is detected with magnitude @xmath75 .",
    "while this is still possible with our image normalization procedure , it is rather complicated .",
    "we opt instead to calculate just the completeness as a function of magnitude @xmath76 , accounting for the variation in limiting magnitude across the image as follows .    at magnitudes well above our limiting magnitudes",
    "we assume that the completeness @xmath76 is affected only by crowding : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the area on the sky covered by objects with magnitudes brighter than @xmath46 .",
    "this conservatively assumes that a simulated object added to the images would not be split by focas if it overlapped an existing object . at fainter magnitudes where it is possible",
    "that objects have been missed due to noise fluctuations , we must account for the variation in limiting magnitude across the image .",
    "we assume that completeness is a function of signal - to - noise only , ignoring its dependence on surface brightness . in each filter",
    ", we calculate the fraction @xmath79 of simulated objects recovered by focas as a function of counts in the normalized image , or equivalently as a function of @xmath80@xmath81z.p.@xmath142.5@xmath38log10(counts ) , the magnitude measured on the normalized constant - rms image .",
    "( the technical details of this procedure are given in the following paragraph . )",
    "we want to convert this to the recovery fraction @xmath82 as a function of @xmath83 , the real magnitude of an object after the normalization correction .",
    "we know the area @xmath84 of the image as a function of @xmath85=@xmath83@xmath14@xmath80 .",
    "thus we calculate @xmath82 by summing over the fractional area at each @xmath85 multiplied by the fraction @xmath79 of recovered simulated objects with a magnitude on the normalized image corresponding to that real magnitude : @xmath86 we also accounted for galactic extinction @xmath70 in each filter of each field so that the final completeness values @xmath87=@xmath88 were for identical values of @xmath89 in each field .",
    "the exact procedure followed in adding simulated objects to the images of each field was as follows .",
    "we took the normalized images from all filters which went into the summed image .",
    "we used focas clean to remove from the normalized images objects with fewer total counts in the  filter than an object @xmath305 fainter than the 3@xmath55 limit in the summed image .",
    "( this step was of course repeated for brighter counts bins spaced every 0.5 in magnitude . )",
    "we then added unresolved objects 30 at a time to the cleaned images in each filter simultaneously , using the psf of each image , a base color of @xmath90=4 and @xmath91=1.5 for the objects , and a random magnitude offset within the magnitude bin in each filter .",
    "( thus the range of colors simulated is @xmath1505 around the base values . )",
    "we summed these altered images and reran focas .",
    "simulated objects should thus be recovered unless they merged with an object brighter than themselves in  and were not split by focas .",
    "( strictly speaking , this step should be repeated for each filter , each time removing objects fainter than the simulated objects _ in that filter_. ) this procedure yields the completeness in all filters simultaneously , albeit in different magnitude bins given by the average galaxy colors used .",
    "we repeated this procedure 34 times in each counts bin , each time including different randomly generated poisson noise appropriate to the object s counts and the image gain .",
    "we repeated the entire procedure for each field , taking into account its galactic extinction .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig_complete ] , plotted against @xmath92 to enable direct comparison of fields of different limiting magnitudes .",
    "unusually low completeness is typically due to poor seeing ; unusually high completeness can be due to good seeing or to destriping ( see  [ destripe ] ) .",
    "the 50% completeness magnitudes have a range of @xmath1505 around the average 3@xmath55 limiting magnitude , or equivalently the completeness at the 3@xmath55 limiting magnitude has a range of @xmath1530% .",
    "we use these completeness fractions to correct our observed counts . using point sources to determine completeness correction provides only a lower limit to the true counts of finite - sized galaxies ( @xcite ) , and will bias the results near the detection limit .",
    "however , small average sizes are found for galaxies at the magnitudes we reach by deep ground - based imaging ( @xcite ) and by @xmath61 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , so point sources will reasonably approximate the morphology of faint galaxies in the @xmath111.5  seeing of our data .",
    "an obvious first step in comparing our data to previous work is to compare the number of galaxies as a function of magnitude , but prior to that a correction for contamination by stars will be necessary .",
    "sources of uncertainty in number - magnitude counts include surface brightness threshold effects , confusion of multiple objects as a single object , splitting of a single object into several spurious components , incompleteness in the galaxy catalog , inclusion of spurious objects in the galaxy catalog , errors in the measured galaxy magnitudes , misclassification of stars as galaxies ( and vice versa ) , field - to - field variations due to clustering , and poisson noise due to the finite number of galaxies detected .",
    "as discusssed in the previous section , the first three effects should be well accounted for by our completeness corrections , and the contribution of spurious objects should be small ( @xcite ) .",
    "magnitude errors are best accounted for by the completeness matrix which we have not calculated , but the simple @xmath76 approach is acceptable .",
    "poisson noise and field - to - field clustering variations are unavoidable but their expected strengths can be computed ( see  [ angcorr ] ) .    the misclassification of stars as galaxies at faint magnitudes can be corrected statistically if the observed stellar counts at bright magnitudes can be extrapolated to fainter magnitudes using a model of the galaxy .",

    "( blue stars can be identified to fainter than @xmath95 by using information in the @xmath18 images , but at @xmath71@xmath13@xmath95 all stars should have been identified , regardless of color . ) we binned in 05 wide bins the counts of all objects in our fields , of stars only , and of galaxies only .",
    "the stellar n(m ) at @xmath13@xmath95 matched the predictions from sky to within the observational errors in all fields except q  0736@xmath14063 .",
    "the predictions were too high for this field , and we exclude it from the following analyses . to obtain the final n(m ) for each field , for each magnitude bin with @xmath13@xmath95 we subtracted the observed stellar counts from the counts of all objects .",
    "for @xmath10@xmath95 we conservatively subtracted the larger of the observed stellar counts in that bin or the counts as predicted by sky .",
    "the 1@xmath55 errors for each magnitude bin were calculated using the number of all original objects in the bin , star or galaxy , and the tables of gehrels ( 1986 ) .",
    "we consider briefly the q  0736@xmath14063 field .",
    "the galactic extinction = 0.27 for this field is only an estimate , but this can not explain the discrepancy . to bring the observed n(m ) in line with predictions would require our @xmath71 magnitudes to be at least 05 too faint , or @xmath231.85 .",
    "the @xmath18@xmath14@xmath71 vs. @xmath71 diagram for this field is if anything biased toward a bluer color distribution than average , suggesting an overestimated rather than underestimated , and unequivocally rules out @xmath231.85 .",
    "thus in this field the predicted stellar n(m ) was scaled to the observed stellar n(m ) at @xmath13@xmath95=16.5 before subtraction from the the galaxy n(m ) .",
    "the scaling factor was 0.545 , or @xmath140.263 in the log .",
    "the sky counts are estimated to be uncertain by @xmath110.16 in the log ( @xcite , figure 2 ) .",
    "the resulting galaxy counts are consistent with those of mcleod  ( 1995 ) , but we do not consider this field in future analyses since its  is only an estimate .    figure [ fig_nmb4after1 ] shows the n(m ) relations for all our individual fields before and after correction for stellar contamination as detailed above . the striking feature of the graph is the large field - to - field scatter at a given magnitude .",
    "post - correction fields are not plotted beyond the 50% completeness magnitude , explaining the apparently reduced scatter in those fields at @xmath1019 .",
    "the stellar contamination correction , which noticeably reduces the counts at @xmath1318.5 , only slightly reduces the field - to - field scatter .",
    "the field - to - field scatter spans a factor of @xmath110.4 in the log at = 2021 ; i.e. the highest measured surface density per bin is @xmath112.5 times the lowest . as shown in ",

    "were coadded at each magnitude , weighting by the area of each contributing field .",
    "we excluded the fields of q  0736@xmath14063 ( uncertain ) and q  1508@xmath14055 ( shallow @xmath71 and no @xmath18 data ) , and magnitude bins with @xmath1350% completeness .",
    "the average n(m ) for all 31 good rlq fields with @xmath97@xmath1020  ( covering a total area of 221 arcmin@xmath57 ) is shown in figure [ fig_knm1 ] ( solid squares + solid line ) , along with counts from the literature ( open or half - filled symbols ) .",
    "our counts lie within the range found in the literature . at 16@xmath98@xmath9819 ,",
    "our n(m ) agrees quite well with the hawaii surveys ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the survey of mcleod  ( 1995 ) . at @xmath2319 ,",
    "our results are higher than average and agree most closely with the counts of soifer  ( 1994 ) , which are as high or higher than any others in the literature , possibly due to their target fields being around known objects at high redshift .",
    "the excess is large enough that it can not be explained by spurious objects fainter than the 5@xmath55 limit in each field even if they contaminate the catalog by 10% ( 0.04 dex ) at those magnitudes ( see  [ catalog ] ) .      as mentioned in ",
    "[ sky ] , the field - to - field variation in galaxy counts is quite large .",

    "this result is expected , and is due to galaxy clustering .",
    "we follow djorgovski  ( 1995 ) in estimating the contribution of faint galaxy clustering to the field - to - field variation in our counts ( see @xcite for a more exact method ) .",
    "we assume an angular correlation function @xmath99=@xmath100 ( all @xmath101 measured in arcsec ) and a simple circular top - hat window function of angular radius @xmath102=@xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the mean area of the fields in arcsec@xmath57 .",

    "we adopt this relation for our fields .",
    "note that this clustering amplitude is about a factor of two higher than for optically selected galaxies in equivalent magnitude ranges .",
    "this is likely due to preferential selection of blue galaxies ( which are less strongly clustered ) at optical wavelengths .",
    "the observed rms field - to - field variation in our stellar - contamination - corrected quasar field galaxy counts agrees with the predictions of the carlberg   @xmath99 to within @xmath1525% in various subsets of the data considered ( magnitude limits from = 19 to 21 , all fields , all 1994 or 1995 fields , all @xmath101.4 or @xmath131.4 fields ) .",

    "values range from less than or equal to the lowest field survey values in the literature to above the highest .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig_knm1 ] that at @xmath319 our galaxy counts are higher than those of field surveys ; i.e. , there is an excess of galaxies in our combined rlq fields .",
    "the larger excess at fainter magnitudes argues that the overall excess is not simply a random fluctuation in the counts , and in paper 2 we will show that the excess does not have the same  color distribution as the field population and that at least part of it is spatially concentrated around the quasars .",
    "however , the similarity of the slope of our fields n(m ) counts and the literature counts is suggestive of a systematic offset in magnitude scales being responsible for at least some the difference in the counts . before we can quantify the strength of the galaxy excess in these fields",
    ", we must consider the effects of systematic errors in our comparison of our n(m ) results with the literature .",
    "three `` @xmath2 '' filters have been used for faint galaxy work : @xmath2 , @xmath110 ( @xcite ) , and @xmath71 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these are different passbands by definition , but the effective passbands can also be significantly altered by differences between filter sets at different observatories ( see @xcite ) and by the atmospheric transmission at the telescope site .",
    "fortunately , most faint galaxy studies have been calibrated to one of two @xmath2-band photometric systems : the cit system ( @xcite ) to which the elias  ( 1982 ) standards are calibrated , or the ukirt system ( @xcite ) .",
    "casali & hawarden give the transformations @xmath111 typical faint galaxies with @xmath35@xmath14@xmath2=1.5 should be 003 fainter on the @xmath112 scale than on the @xmath113 scale .",
    "our photometric calibration is to the @xmath112 scale , though we have retained the notation  since our observations were in that filter .",
    "soifer  ( 1994 ) , minezaki  ( 1998a ) , and dickinson  ( 1998 ) also observe in  and calibrate to @xmath112 .",
    "minezaki  find no color term between  and @xmath112 , but from the different isophotal wavelengths of the filters they estimate : @xmath114 like minezaki , we do not make this correction , instead assuming = @xmath112 for the ukirt standards . if the above relation is correct , then our = @xmath112 + 0.02 , assuming a typical color of = 0.5 .",
    "in other words , our @xmath71 magnitude scale ( and those of soifer , minezaki , and dickinson ) may be 002 fainter than the @xmath112 scale to which we claim we are calibrated .",
    "however , that one of us ( mc ) calculates @xmath71=@xmath112@xmath140019@xmath150013 for ( ) @xmath115=0 , so the average difference between @xmath71 and @xmath112 may be less than + 002 for faint galaxies",
    ". we will assume a + 002 difference to be conservative .    of the @xmath2 surveys",
    "to which we have compared our data , those of mcleod  ( 1995 ) , ees97 , and the hawaii group ( @xcite ; @xcite ) are on the cit system .",
    "the mcleod  data were obtained using a @xmath71 filter , and so may require a color term in the transformation to the cit system , although they did not detect one in their data . combining equations [ eq_kcit ] and [ eq_ks ] above , with the same assumed average colors , we estimate @xmath71=@xmath113 + 0.05 .",
    "most of the remaining surveys , namely djorgovski  ( 1995 ) , glazebrook  ( 1994 ) , moustakas  ( 1997 ) , minezaki  ( 1998a ) , soifer  ( 1994 ) , and the hdf ( @xcite ) , are on the ukirt system , with the caveat for the latter three discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "lastly , the eso surveys ( saracco  1997 ) are on the @xmath110 system as derived from observations of elias standards and the relation @xmath116 given by wainscoat & cowie ( 1992 ) . combining this with equation [ eq_kcit ]",
    ", we obtain @xmath117 assuming average = 1.5 and = 0.5 as above , the eso magnitude scale can be put on the cit system by subtracting 010@xmath15002 and on the ukirt system by subtracting 007@xmath15002 .",
    "these average transformations between systems are accurate to only a few percent since faint galaxies will show a range of colors .",
    "the differences between systems are rarely larger than the @xmath11005 typical zeropoint uncertainty quoted for the various surveys , although the actual uncertainty in the correction to exoatmospheric magnitudes may be larger if extinction coefficient uncertainties are large .",
    "even if the systematic magnitude scale offsets are not large , they may be enough to explain the difference between our quasar field counts and the literature control field counts .    to test the effects of systematics",
    ", we attempt to place all available data on the ukirt @xmath2 magnitude scale .",
    "( we choose the ukirt scale because accurate flux zeropoints are available for it ; see appendix  [ photsys ] ) . we adjust data from this work , dickinson , soifer , and minezaki  brightwards by 002 .",
    "we adjust the mcleod  data brightwards by 002 , and the eso data ( @xcite ) brightwards by 007 .",
    "we adjust all other literature data on the cit system ( namely the hawaii surveys ) faintwards by 003 .",
    "we then linearly interpolate the counts back to the original bin centers where necessary and find the area - weighted average of the n(m ) from the different surveys . since the eso ( @xcite ) and minezaki  ( 1998a ) surveys are each @xmath11170 arcmin@xmath57 in size , they are the dominant contributors to the literature control field counts at 17@xmath13@xmath2@xmath1319 .",
    "in figure [ fig_nmsysvslit ] we plot @xmath118 for our data and for the area - weighted average of all published random - field imaging surveys which reach @xmath112@xmath2317 ( i.e. excluding soifer  1994 , ees97 , and dickinson  1998 ) , including formal uncertainties on the magnitudes .",
    "area - weighted rms error bars are plotted for the literature data , but they probably underestimate the true rms fluctuations at each magnitude between fields of size similar to ours ( @xmath118  arcmin@xmath57 ) . since much of the area at @xmath2@xmath4219 comes from large surveys which are treated as single fields when computing the rms .",
    "we also plot data from our 1994 and 1995 kpno 4 m runs separately for comparison .",
    "even with everything calibrated onto the same magnitude scale , there is a significant offset between our quasar - field data and the control - field data .",
    "even if our simple offsets have in fact brought all surveys magnitudes onto a common scale , it is probable that there are more systematics present in these various datasets than we have removed ( cf .",
    "the discussion of aperture correction differences by djorgovski  ( 1995 ) and the discussion of the true cit and ukirt magnitude scale offsets above ) .",
    "in particular , near the faint end of all surveys there may be nonlinear offsets which depend on how `` total '' magnitudes were estimated .",
    "however , the only control fields we have reason to prefer are our own , and they are too noisy to use by themselves . thus our best option is to compare our data to the average of all available random - field data and to remove those systematics we believe we can estimate .      from figure [ fig_nmsysvslit ]",
    "we see that in the range = 1719 our 1994 and 1995 data agree well in slope , but not in normalization .",
    "figure [ fig_nmsysvslit2]a shows a closeup of this magnitude range .",
    "the rms errors on the control field data are large enough that essentially all our data are in agreement with the control field data in this magnitude range , but the 1995 data lies consistently above the other datasets .",
    "a systematic offset of our 1995 data brightwards of our 1994 data is consistent with the possible zeropoint and extinction coefficient systematics discussed in  [ photkpno ] .",
    "the conservative assumption would be that the offset between our 1994 and 1995 data and between those data and the literature is due to systematic errors .",
    "however , a complication in untangling systematic effects from real differences is that the 1994 data are composed almost exclusively of @xmath101.4 quasars , and the 1995 data of @xmath131.4 quasars . based on the  relation of powerful radio galaxies , a brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg )",
    "might be expected to have @xmath1117 at = 1 and @xmath1118 at = 1.4 .",
    "thus it is plausible that the difference between our 1994 and 1995 datasets is real , caused by the appearance of cluster galaxies at brighter apparent magnitudes in the 1995 ( @xmath131.4 ) dataset .",
    "since we can not @xmath119 discriminate between these two possibilities , we will quantify the galaxy excess for both of them .",
    "our liberal assumption is that no further systematics exist once all surveys have been put on the ukirt @xmath2 magnitude scale as described in ",
    "[ syslit ] .",
    "thus our @xmath120 magnitudes are @xmath112 magnitudes , which we estimate are equal to as @xmath14002 as discussed in  [ syslit ] , and whose n(m ) relation is shown in figure [ fig_nmsysvslit ] .",
    "our conservative assumption is that our 1994 and 1995 data should be matched to each other and to the control field data at 17@xmath13@xmath1318 ; i.e. that systematic errors are responsible for the offsets between our two datasets and the control fields .",
    "we offset our 1994 @xmath112 magnitudes 006 faintwards and our 1995 @xmath112 magnitudes 012 faintwards to form our @xmath121 magnitudes .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig_nmsysvslit2]b , with these offsets our 1994 data exactly match the control field data at = 17.518 , our 1995 data match at = 1717.5 , and all three datasets lie within each others 1@xmath55 ( rms ) error bars at = 1718 . our conservative magnitude scale n(m ) relation is shown in figure [ fig_nmsys2vslit ] .",
    "we give our control field counts in table [ tab_knm_cf ] and the area - weighted average of the published literature counts in table [ tab_knm_puball ] , both converted to the  system as detailed above .",
    "we have presented optical and infrared data for a sample of 33 radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) at = 12 , discussed our data reduction procedures , and shown that the galaxy number counts in our fields lie above those of random - field surveys in the literature .",
    "paper 2 ( hall & green 1998 ) presents an analysis and discussion of the excess galaxy population in these fields .    an unusual feature of our data reduction procedure is the image normalization procedure (  [ coadd ] ) which allows useful results to be obtained from the edges of the fields which have less than the full exposure time .",
    "the complications introduced by this procedure were in the end worth enduring , since otherwise we would have had very little data at @xmath1080@xmath39 from the quasars .",
    "data at such large angular distances was extremely useful for confirming the existence and extent of the large - scale excess galaxy population and for measuring the richnesses of the smaller - scale excesses seen in many fields ( see paper 2 ) .",
    "the complications faced in establishing the random - field @xmath2-band counts for comparison with our quasar - field data (  [ syslit ] ) arose from two sources : first , the higher field - to - field variation in @xmath2-band counts compared to optical counts ; and second , lack of a commonly used well - defined photometric system at @xmath122 . regarding the first point , it is worth investigating whether random - field @xmath35 and @xmath36-band observations show substantially smaller field - to - field variations than @xmath2-band observations . regarding the second point",
    ", we echo the call of cohen  ( 1992 ) for the adoption of a truly standard system of ir passbands designed to minimize site - to - site differences due to atmospheric variations .",
    "one such system is described by young , milone & stagg ( 1994 ) . at the least , until such time as such",
    "a system is widely available , we encourage extragalactic @xmath122 observers ( including ourselves ) to pay more attention to photometric calibration of their data than typically done in the past . it would also be useful to have standard star measurements in @xmath71 as well as @xmath2 , since there can be a few percent difference between magnitudes in the two filters .",
    "such data should be forthcoming shortly from the denis ( @xcite ) and 2mass ( @xcite ) surveys .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig_knm1 ] that at @xmath319 there is an excess of galaxies in our combined rlq fields .",
    "the reality of this excess is not in doubt , but its magnitude is (  [ systematics ] ) .",
    "@xmath71 data from our 1995 kpno 4 m run lies consistently above the 1994 dataset and the control fields , and a systematic brightwards offset of our 1995 data is consistent with possible systematic uncertainties in the @xmath71 zeropoint and extinction coefficient for that run (  [ photkpno ] ) .",
    "thus we will conduct much of our analysis in paper 2 in parallel for two magnitude scales : conservative ( ukirt @xmath2 magnitudes , but corrected for each dataset so that its bright - end n(m ) relation matches the literature control fields , i.e. assuming the offsets are purely systematic errors ) and liberal ( ukirt @xmath2 magnitudes , i.e. assuming no systematics exist beyond those between our natural @xmath71 and ukirt @xmath2 magnitudes as described in  [ syslit ] ) .",
    "future photometric snapshots of our fields in a @xmath2 filter on a well - calibrated system would reduce the uncertainties on the surface density of the excess galaxy population in these fields .",

    "<S> [ begin ]    we have conducted an optical / near - infrared study of the environments of radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) at redshifts = 0.62.0 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the sample selection and observations for the = 1.02.0 subsample and the reduction and cataloguing techniques used . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss technical issues at some length , since few detailed descriptions of near - ir data reduction and multicolor object cataloguing are currently available in single literature references .    </S>",
    "<S> our sample of 33 rlqs contains comparable numbers of flat- and steep - radio - spectrum sources and sources of various radio morphologies , and spans a similar range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , allowing us to disentangle dependence of environment on optical or radio luminosity from redshift evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the standard `` shift - and - stare '' method of creating deep mosaiced images where the exposure time ( and thus the rms noise ) at each pixel is not constant across the mosaic . </S>",
    "<S> an unusual feature of our reduction procedure is the creation of images with constant rms noise from such mosaics . </S>",
    "<S> we adopted this procedure to enable use of the focas detection package over almost the entire mosaic instead of only in the area of deepest observation where the rms noise is constant , thereby roughly doubling our areal coverage .    </S>",
    "<S> we correct the object counts in our fields for stellar contamination using the sky model of cohen ( 1995 ) and compare the galaxy counts to those in random fields . even after accounting for possible systematic magnitude offsets </S>",
    "<S> , we find a significant excess of @xmath2@xmath319 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> analysis and discussion of this excess population is presented by hall & green ( 1998 ) .    </S>",
