    "the late time accelerated expansion of the universe has attracted much attention in recent years .",

    "some other observations , such as cosmic microwave background fluctuations @xcite , baryon acoustics oscillations @xcite , large scale structure @xcite and weak lensing @xcite provide a strong support in favour of cosmic acceleration .",
    "these observations led to so many novel ideas and changed the concept regarding the matter - energy budget of universe .",
    "the accelerated expansion is usually attributed to a strong negative pressure due to an exotic dark energy form . despite a lot of success , einstein s general relativity ( gr ) in its usual form",
    "fails to explain the late time acceleration .",
    "however , a cosmological constant ( may be time varying ) in the source term can be a good candidate for dark energy .",
    "it is now believed that the universe is mostly dominated by the presence of dark energy ( @xmath5 ) and dark matter ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the baryonic matter comprises only of 4.9% .",
    "of late , modified theories of general relativity seem attractive in the understanding of the exotic nature of dark energy and the consequent late time cosmic acceleration .",
    "gr can be modified in two different ways . either the matter source can be modified ( by considering scalar field contribution or by including an exotic energy source term in the usual field equations ) or by modifying the underlying geometry .",
    "the later method , of late , has gained much interest where the standard einstein - hilbert action is replaced by an arbitrary function may be of ricci scalar @xmath7 ( @xmath8 gravity ) , of scalar torsion @xmath9 ( @xmath10 gravity ) , of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 gravity and @xmath13 gravity ) or of inclusion of some other matter field lagrangian along with some geometrical features .",
