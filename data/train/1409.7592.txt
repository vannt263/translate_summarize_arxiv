    "the concept of wave localization due to disorder , known as anderson localization ( al ) , has been around for quite some time  @xcite , and several reviews have been written on this topic recently ( _ cf_. refs  @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon appears as a consequence of the destructive interference of multiple scattered waves and has been observed in such different physical contexts as electronics , photonics , bose - einstein condensates ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , to name a few . whenever the corresponding physical system can be modeled with a tight - binding hamiltonian with time - invariant potential for non - interacting particles , al can be found .",
    "this is particularly the case for the propagation of light in evanescently coupled optical waveguide arrays . here ,",
    "over recent years , impressive progress in experimental development in one ( 1d ) and two dimensions ( 2d ) has been made  @xcite .",
    "diverse quantum , and condensed matter , phenomena have been reproduced in these -clean and macroscopic- setups , by using electromagnetic waves  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been possible to incorporate controlled disorder during the fabrication of these photonic structures , and different studies concerning al have been carried out  @xcite .",
    "in general , localization properties depend strongly on the dimensionality of the system  @xcite . in difference to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) case , in 1d and 2d already the slightest amount of uncorrelated disorder leads to a complete exponential localization for all eigenmodes without any mobility edge , even though the localization length is much larger for 2d systems  @xcite .",
    "but when correlations are included in the system , the picture changes dramatically  @xcite and long - range transport may be still possible , even in low dimensions ( for a recent review see  @xcite ) .",
    "the paradigmatic example in 1d is the _ random dimer model _ ( rdm )",
    "@xcite , where the pairing of adjacent on - site energies ( dimers ) , at random positions in the lattice , leads to two - site correlations for an otherwise random binary model . for finite lattices of length @xmath0",
    ", the rdm shows that , below a certain threshold of the disorder strength , there are @xmath1 extended ( thus transparent ) states , resulting in super - diffusive wave - packet evolution below the threshold , and diffusive transport exactly at the threshold region  @xcite .",
    "these delocalized eigenstates were shown in experiments  @xcite , whereas a direct observation of the transport properties was reported only recently  @xcite .",
    "a two - dimensional rectangular optical waveguide array can be thought as a classical analog to study quantum transport of two interacting particles in an one - dimensional chain , in the context of a bose - hubbard model .",
    "the problem is mapped to a 2d lattice , where the interaction between particles is described by taking the propagation constants at the lattice diagonal ( @xmath2 ) different to the rest of the lattice  @xcite .",
    "recently  @xcite , it was shown that the interaction between particles could promote a metallic two - particle state in a 1d quasiperiodic lattice , whereas the single - particle ( classical ) regime presented no transport  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of a 2d random dimer lattice presents an interesting possibility to observe similar features in a model presenting a well defined transport transition .    in the present work",
    ", we will use a special construction of disorder in two dimensions , called pseudo 2d , to map our system described by a tight - binding hamiltonian for non - interacting particles onto 1d chains .",
    "this enables us to access the super - diffusive transport properties in such arrays .",
    "we will first , in section  [ model ] , present the model of pseudo - two - dimensional lattices using a separation ansatz ; then , in section  [ modes ] , we use the extension of eigenmodes in smaller lattices to show the threshold behavior and its dependence on system size . in section  [ evol ]",
    "we show the super - diffusive transport in the numerical long - time evolution of correlated arrays and compare the localization volume of random binary pseudo-2d arrays to 1d lattices .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclu ] we conclude the present work .",
    "we start from a 2d discrete linear schrdinger equation corresponding to a tight - binding hamiltonian for non - interacting particles , which also describes , e.g. , the evolution of the field envelope amplitude of light propagating in the longitudinal direction @xmath3 in a 2d linear waveguide array  @xcite : @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 corresponding to the onsite - propagation constant at site @xmath7 . linear coupling , between different lattice sites of a square lattice , is defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the nearest - neighbor hopping constant . without loss of generality , we set @xmath10 , having in mind its rescaling effect on site energies and the effective propagation time / distance .",
    "now , by restricting our study to the case @xmath11 , we make a dimension reduction by means of a separable ansatz : @xmath12 .",
    "thus , we obtain two _ independent _ set of equations  @xcite for each separable dimension : @xmath13 the propagation constants @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are chosen in random pairs ( dimers ) as follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is chosen randomly in the interval @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "@xmath19 corresponds to the index ( energy ) contrast , which defines the differences in propagation constants ( energies ) between two different sites . in the following",
    ", we will consider four different cases of disorder realizations :    1 .   equally correlated random dimers ( ecoradi ) : @xmath20 [ sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "2 .   different correlated random dimers ( dicoradi ) : @xmath21 [ sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] .",
    "3 .   a binary case of uncorrelated random monomers ( uncoram ) ;",
    "i.e. , the case where the onsite propagation constants in model ( [ dls2d ] ) are chosen randomly between two precise values : @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "4 .   a binary case of pseudo-2d uncorrelated random monomers ( ramps ) , where the onsite propagation constants _ for each site _ in model ( [ eq1d2d ] )",
    "are chosen randomly between the precise values : @xmath22 or @xmath19 .     and",
    "@xmath24 are shown on both axis .",
    "( 0,0 ) circle ; @xmath25 , ( 0,0 ) circle ; @xmath26 , ( 0,0 ) circle ; @xmath27 . ]",
    "to understand the fundamental properties of different lattices , it is crucial to get some information about the eigenmodes of every system . by analyzing their spatial localization features , we could gain a good insight of possible transport properties on the particular lattice . in order to investigate the spatial extension of a wave - packet in a square lattice of @xmath28 sites with fixed boundary conditions , we define the normalized participation ratio as @xmath29 with @xmath30 being a conserved quantity of model ( [ dls2d ] ) . in an optical waveguide array context",
    ", @xmath31 corresponds to the optical power ( in other contexts as bec s , this quantity is usually named as norm or number of particles ) .",
    "the participation ratio @xmath32 is a very useful quantity  @xcite , which helps us to identify the number of effectively excited sites of a given profile , it can be understood as well as an effective occupied area of the profile . for a highly localized wave packet , @xmath32 approaches @xmath33 , and tends to @xmath34 for the case of a completely homogeneous array excitation .",
    "we use it here to calculate the extension of the @xmath35 eigenmodes of a 2d square array with given disorder distribution .",
    "following the arguments presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , in an 1d array of @xmath0 lattice sites governed by the rdm , a fraction of @xmath36 eigenmodes are extended over the whole lattice , as long as @xmath37 .",
    "thus , long - range transport is possible below a certain threshold .",
    "therefore , in a separable pseudo-2d array described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq1d2d ] ) , with system size @xmath28 , we expect the same behavior , but for @xmath38 states . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot @xmath39 versus the contrast degree @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath40 is defined as the average participation ratio for the @xmath0 most extended ( with largest @xmath32-value ) eigenmodes , of a given realization and given @xmath19 .",
    "then , @xmath39 is obtained by averaging over @xmath41 realizations for each @xmath19-value , for different system sizes ( @xmath35 ) . for this computation ,",
    "we choose small systems sizes ( @xmath42 ) to trace the appearance of the threshold behavior .",
    "this is done in order to estimate the smallest @xmath35value required to observe the predicted phenomenology , which is important when thinking on a experimental implementation of the presented problem .",
    "vs. @xmath19 for ( a ) uncoram , ( b ) dicoradi , ( c ) uncoram and ( d ) ramps cases .",
    "all values are averaged over @xmath41 realizations of disorder .",
    "the dot - dashed ( thin dashed , thick dashed , thin full , thick full ) curve corresponds to @xmath43 , respectively . ]",
    "the participation ratio for all cases ( i)-(iv ) is displayed in figs .",

    "this corresponds roughly to an average size of the eigenmodes larger than @xmath46 of the lattice , what actually implies very delocalized states [ for the ordered case ( @xmath47 ) and for very small @xmath19 extended linear modes cover around @xmath48 of the lattice ] . for @xmath49 ,",
    "@xmath39 drops abruptly , especially for larger lattices .",
    "this phenomenon can be clearly attributed to the threshold behavior of the rdm  @xcite , what is highly dependent on the system size . in order to indeed observe more modes with a localization length larger than the extension of the lattice , a larger system size is required . from this figure",
    ", it is difficult to determine the emergence of the al because this is a dynamical effect which is associated with the absence of diffusion across the lattice .",
    "however , we could identify that its appearance must occur for @xmath50 , where larger lattices have a @xmath51 .",
    "a rather similar scenario , but without a clear plateau and without such a pronounced threshold , is observed for the case dicoradi [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] . for all system sizes ,",
    "we observe a smooth decrement of @xmath39 , as a function of @xmath19 , with some change on the curvature around @xmath52 ( a more abrupt decrement is observed after this region ) . for the uncoram and ramps cases ,",
    "the curves of @xmath39 show a rather smooth and fast decrement , without any threshold signature ; they show only a reduction of the mode participation ratio as disorder grows , as uncorrelated disordered systems must show .",
    "furthermore , for the ramps case we observe a smaller participation ratio for growing @xmath19 than for the uncoram case , suggesting a difference in localization volume for these cases , as will be confirmed in the following section [ evol ] .",
    "for all the cases , we observe that for @xmath53 results converge , and that the transition threshold becomes evident .",
    "to characterize and determine the diffusion of a wave - packet , we study the evolution of the _ second moment _ , which measures the size of a given profile in terms of its width with respect to a given center of mass . for two dimensional lattices ,",
    "we compute this quantity for each dimension separately .",
    "first of all , we define the center of mass in the horizontal and vertical directions @xmath54 respectively .",

    "the second moment evolves super - diffusively as @xmath59 , while at the threshold the transport becomes diffusive with @xmath60 . above the threshold , the expansion is diffusive up to the localization length and then the second moment saturates , and diffusion is stopped . to prove the validity of the separation ansatz",
    ", we numerically integrate the original model equations ( [ dls2d ] ) with the initial excitation @xmath61 , located at the central site @xmath62 for an value of @xmath63 below the threshold . to compute the long - time evolution up to @xmath64",
    ", we implement a symplectic solver with a @xmath65 integration scheme  @xcite .",
    "the lattice sizes are chosen in such a way that the wave - packet spreading never reaches the border , reaching a maximum lattice extension of @xmath66 for the ecoradi and dicoradi cases , and @xmath67 for the uncoram case .",
    "we average over @xmath68 realizations for each case .",
    "this may appear as an insufficient number of realizations at first glance ; but , since every second moment , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , includes the summation over the other dimension , curves are very smooth with nearly undistinguishable standard deviation , which is actually plotted with shadows for all cases in fig [ fig3 ] .     vs. @xmath71 , for ecoradi ( green ) , dicoradi ( blue ) and uncoram ( red ) .",
    "the dashed lines represent @xmath72 ( green ) and @xmath73 ( red ) .",
    "ramps for @xmath20 and @xmath21 are shown in black and gray , respectively .",
    "all curves are a result of averaging over @xmath68 realizations of disorder with @xmath63 , the shadows show the corresponding standard deviation .",
    "inset : saturation in random binary 1d arrays ( blue ) vs. ramps lattices .",
    "( red),scaledwidth=46.0% ]    our main result , the evolution of @xmath74 for @xmath63 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for ecoradi , dicoradi , uncoram and two ramps cases , in green , blue , red , black and gray , respectively .",
    "we can confirm , that both the overlapping ecoradi and dicoradi evolve superdiffusively parallel to the green dashed line @xmath75/2 $ ] showing no sign of change in curvature for growing @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , they behave as their one - dimensional counterparts @xcite .",
    "the case of uncoram evolves still sub - diffusively ( see that results are below the red dashed line ) .",
    "this can be understood by thinking about the localization length @xmath76 properties . in a completely random @xmath77 array ,",
    "@xmath76 scales exponentially  @xcite with the mean free path @xmath78 as @xmath79 , in contrast to a @xmath80 array for which @xmath81 . in our case ,",
    "the @xmath67 arrays are just too small to observe saturation of transport for a @xmath77 array .",
    "therefore , we also show the results for two kind of ramps arrays , with @xmath20 ( black ) and @xmath21 ( gray ) , that show earlier saturation , as expected for uncorrelated binary disorder .",
    "since we observe the huge difference between localization length in the uncoram and ramps cases , we furthermore explored the localization behavior of ramps vs. _ real _ 1d random binary arrays  @xcite . in order to give a qualitative measure of the localization length",
    ", we define a mean value @xmath82 , which is computed by averaging over the interval @xmath83 .",
    "the results are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . we observe a saturation tendency for the random binary 1d array and the 2d ramps lattice tending to almost the same value of @xmath82 for each contrast of disorder @xmath19 . by doing this ,",
    "we demonstrate that the behavior of the pseudo 2d array is essentially one - dimensional , as was suggested by the construction of the disorder .",
    "along this work we showed that a restriction of the distribution of on - site disorder facilitates the separation of dimensions in an originally two - dimensional array without interaction .",
    "this so - called pseudo-2d arrays show the same threshold behavior as the 1d case for a value equal to the sum of two 1d threshold values . if interaction would be included ( leading to an effective nonlinearity )",
    ", we would expect the threshold to increase in certain regions due to the renormalization of eigen - energies  @xcite .",
    "we found out that in order to observe a threshold behavior for a pseudo-2d lattice , a minimum system size is required @xmath84 , what is crucial when thinking on the experimental implementation of this problem and observation of our findings .",
    "we also showed that , in a long - time evolution for short - range correlated arrays ( ecoradi and dicoradi ) and for @xmath63 , a super - diffusive long - range transport is observed , while for the uncoram case transport becomes sub - diffusive and is expected to saturate for higher evolution times .",
    "the localization length behavior in the pseudo-2d random binary arrays is shown to be comparable to an one - dimensional lattice , which could be very useful to tune the localization volume in such setups .",
