    "the question of solitary - wave solutions in trapped atomic bose - einstein condensed gases has received considerable attention in recent years . remarkably , solitary waves have been created and observed experimentally in both one - component @xcite and two - component systems @xcite .",
    "the easiest problem that one can consider is that of a quasi - one - dimensional bose - einstein condensate which extends to infinity with an effective repulsive interaction . in this case and within the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the system is described by the nonlinear schrdinger equation , which supports solitary - wave solutions , as was shown initially by tsuzuki @xcite , and by zakharov and shabat @xcite .",
    "if one imposes periodic boundary conditions in a finite period of some fixed length , there are significant differences .",
    "it is no longer possible to work in the thermodynamic limit , and it is necessary to impose the particle number normalization condition as well as the constraint of periodicity .",
    "this problem has been addressed within the mean - field approximation by carr et al.@xcite , for static solutions and by the authors of this study for the more general case of moving solutions @xcite .",
    "these were shown to be jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the many - body problem of a single - component bose gas interacting via a contact potential has also been studied by lieb @xcite .",
    "this study assumed periodic boundary conditions and also considered the limit of an infinite period @xmath0 and an infinite number of particles @xmath1 with @xmath2 constant .",
    "the excitation spectrum was found to consist of two branches , one of which was later identified as corresponding to solitary - wave excitation @xcite .",
    "the problem of solitary - wave solutions in binary mixtures of bose - einstein condensates has also been studied theoretically by many people , see , e.g. , @xcite . in the case of strictly one - dimensional motion with the two condensates extending over an infinite line , the coupled system of two non - linear schrdinger equations that describe the two order parameters ( within the mean - field approximation ) has been studied in the context of integrable systems by manakov @xcite .    in the present study we present mean - field solitary - wave solutions for a two - component bose - einstein condensate with repulsive interatomic interactions for a periodic system of finite length @xmath0 . to determine these solutions we impose constraints on the particle number for each component as well as the constraint of periodicity for each species .",
    "this formidable set of constraints is necessary to determine the solution and the dispersion relation , i.e. , the energy versus the angular momentum , of this system .",
    "as in the case of a single component , the solitary - wave solutions are again found to be jacobi elliptic functions @xcite . in this case , however , the presence of the second component permits several qualitatively different solutions , i.e. ,  gray - gray \" and  gray - bright \" solitons .",
    "we will argue that the gray - bright solution has the lowest energy for particular choices of the phase winding numbers and for interactions which are weak in comparison with the kinetic energy of the atoms .",
    "the numerical solution of the equations which result from these constraints also suggests that the choice of the winding numbers does not change for moderate couplings .",
    "this problem is also intimately connected with the  yrast \" problem , i.e. , with the evaluation of the state of lowest energy with some fixed angular momentum .",
    "the yrast state was determined in refs.@xcite and coincides @xcite with the gray - bright solution found below .",
    "the connection with the results of refs.@xcite , obtained directly by minimization of the energy at fixed angular momentum , is clarified and gives further support to the belief that the yrast states are indeed the gray - bright solutions .",
    "although gray - gray solutions are also possible , the gray - bright solution has a lower energy .",
    "the qualitative explanation of this result is simple .",
    "the density depression found in the gray component is ( at least partially ) filled by the bright component .",
    "this leads to a more uniform total density and thus to a lower energy provided that the interatomic interaction is repulsive .",
    "finally , in the particular case of weak interatomic interactions , the complete energy spectrum of the system is determined by diagonalization the many - body hamiltonian .",
    "this is done by identifying certain bilinears of the annihilation and creation operators with angular momentum operators . under the assumption of weak coupling , the interaction terms in the hamiltonian",
    "can be re - expressed in terms of casimir operators and thus permit the analytic diagonaliztion of the hamiltonian .    in the following we first present our model in sec.ii and adopt an ansatz that allows us to solve the two coupled nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equations . in sec.iii",
    "we evaluate the energy and the angular momentum of these solutions . in sec.iv",
    "we impose the constraints that are set by particle normalization and periodicity .",
    "in sec.v we consider the nature of these solutions in the limit of weak interactions , and in sec.vi we present numerical results for our solutions for stronger coupling . in sec.vii",
    "we present the results from diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian .",
    "conclusions and an overview are given in sec.viii .",
    "within the mean - field approximation , the order parameters of the two distinguishable species ( labelled as @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) satisfy the coupled system of the following integrable non - linear equations ( manakov system ) , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and the masses of the two species are assumed to be equal ( and are also set to unity ) .",
    "in addition @xmath7 is the matrix element for collisions between species @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the solitary - wave solutions have the form of traveling waves with the particle density of each species moving with a constant velocity , @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the particle densities , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the chemical potentials of the two species . here",
    "@xmath17 is the spatial variable which is assumed to be periodic on the interval @xmath18 .",
    "following standard procedures , we separate the real and imaginary parts of these equations to find that @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constants of integration , and also @xmath22 making the ansatz @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are parameters independent of the space and time variables , we can integrate these equations . with",
    "this ansatz , the left side of eqs.([eq : ra ] ) and ( [ eq : rb ] ) become functions of @xmath26 and @xmath14 respectively that can be integrated to yield @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are integration constants .",
    "consistency of the ansatz translates into three equations that relate the integration constants and the chemical potentials of the two species together with the condition arising from the identification of the coefficients of @xmath30 @xmath31 our ansatz constrains the integration constants , thus restricting the full solution space of our system of equations . in the generic case",
    "there are six integration constants in eqs.([eq : na ] ) and ( [ eq : nb ] ) , namely @xmath32 and @xmath21 as well as the two constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 arising from the ansatz .",
    "there are also four consistency conditions which reduces the number of free constants to four for any given propagation velocity , @xmath10 .",
    "the integration constant arising from the integration of eqs.([eq : na ] ) and ( [ eq : nb ] ) is not included in this counting since it merely corresponds to a translation of the solution .",
    "however , the solution must also satisfy five constraints , namely two constraints of particle - number normalization , two phase - matching constraints , and one constraint which sets the period of the solution to @xmath0 . in short , there are too many constraints",
    ".    one possible way out of this dilemma would be to view the velocity of propagation , @xmath10 , as a parameter to be set by the constraints .",
    "this , however , would lead to the unphysical result that the velocity of the waves can not be changed without altering the properties of the atoms involved .",
    "if we ignore the ansatz , @xmath10 is expected to be a free parameter , since we have a total of six integration constants ( including the chemical potentials ) and six constraints ( i.e. , two particle number normalizations , two phase matchings and two density matchings . ) the restriction on @xmath10 must be viewed as an artifact of the ansatz .",
    "a more satisfactory way to deal with this problem is to fine tune the coupling constants .",
    "if the masses of the two components are equal , it follows that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are trivially equal .",
    "if , however , @xmath35 ( i.e. , if the scattering lengths between the same and the different species are all equal ) , then the condition of eq.([condition ] ) becomes trivial , and we have five free constants and five constraints .",
    "this allows the velocity of propagation to be a free parameter .",
    "we thus proceed under the assumption that all the coupling constants are equal .",
    "note that in this case eq.([condition ] ) implies that @xmath36 .",
    "it is convenient to factorize the right sides of eqs.([eq : na ] ) and ( [ eq : nb ] ) to obtain the equations @xmath37 where the roots in these equations are written in ascending order .",
    "compatibility between eqs.([eq : na ] ) and ( [ eq : nb ] ) and eqs.([eq : na2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : nb2 ] ) requires that @xmath38 since both densities have maximum and minimum values where their derivatives must vanish , all roots must be real . because of the positivity of @xmath39 , the solution of eq.([eq : na2 ] ) is trapped between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , i.e. , between the minimum and the maximum densities of species @xmath3 .",
    "there are two possibilities for eq.([eq : nb2 ] ) .",
    "for one of these , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . for the other , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the first case corresponds to a gray - gray solution ; the second corresponds to a gray - bright solution .    for the gray - gray solution",
    ", we note that eq.([eq : nb2 ] ) reduces to eq.([eq : na2 ] ) if @xmath48 the solution of eqs.([eq : na2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : nb2 ] ) can then be expressed in terms of jacobi elliptic functions as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and where the first elliptic integral @xmath51 satisfies the periodicity constraint @xmath52 equation ( [ eq : ggrho3 ] ) implies that @xmath53 is the same in eqs.([eq : ggna ] ) and ( [ eq : ggnb ] ) . in this general form ,",

    "hence , the elliptic functions @xmath64 , and @xmath65 become the regular trigonometric functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",

    "the remainder of this paper will focus on the analysis of this solution only .",

    "therefore , a solution of the phase matching constraints involves not only a choice of the winding numbers @xmath101 and @xmath102 , but also a choice for the signs of @xmath109 .",

    "a reasonable measure of this size is the ratio of the complex to the real period of the doubly periodic jacobi solution , since the complex period controls the exponential decay of the solution . in fig.2",

    "the issue of finding solitary - wave solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation is an old problem with varying degrees of difficulty .",
    "the most elementary question is that of a single component which extends to infinity .",
    "the case of a single component with periodic boundary conditions introduces some interesting complications . in the presence of a second component ,",
    "the similar questions introduce additional complications , as there are now two coupled equations . here",
    "we have considered the case of solitary - wave solutions in a two - component bose - einstein condensed gas , which is confined to a zero width ( i.e. , one dimensional ) ring of finite radius , therefore requiring the imposition of periodic boundary conditions .    within the mean - field approximation and with the use of a reasonable ansatz for the solution , we have integrated the coupled nonlinear equations describing order parameters to find two analytic solutions which can be expressed in terms of jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "this problem is also connected to the determination of the yrast state , i.e. , the state of lowest energy state solution given some fixed value of the expectation value of the angular momentum .",
    "we have shown explicitly that the yrast state for this problem is the gray - bright solution , in accordance with general arguments @xcite .",
    "the corresponding phase winding numbers that describe the global minima depend on the angular momentum of the system , giving rise in this way to various sectors of the dispersion relation , which nevertheless remains continuous . for weak coupling ,",
    "this is shown analytically , however the numerical solution of the constraints suggests that the situation does not change qualitatively for stronger couplings .",
    "going beyond the mean - field approximation , we have also diagonalized the many - body hamiltonian exactly in the limit of weak interactions , which allows us to truncate the hamiltonian to the two lowest - angular momentum modes .",
    "we have thus managed to derive the entire excitation spectrum of this many - body system , which in a sense corresponds to a  quantum \" solitary - wave solution .",
    "ideally we would like to find solutions for arbitrary masses @xmath254 and @xmath255 , for arbitrary coupling constants @xmath256 , @xmath257 , and @xmath33 , and for arbitrary @xmath10 .",
    "we have found analytic solutions by imposing the `` artificial '' constraints that @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "we expect that small violations of these constraints would lead to new ( linear ) equations that would be non - singular and well - behaved .",
    "this suggests that the present constrained solutions are broadly representative of all solutions which do not violate the constraints `` violently '' .",
