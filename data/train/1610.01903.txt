    "figure [ fig : avecurrintmott]b demonstrates that it is this shift of the occupied bands to higher frequency that aligns occupied states in the interacting side to open states in the non - interacting side , allowing particles to flow . as @xmath30 is increased further , eventually only the tail of the occupied band is aligned with open states , thus giving a decreasing  but nonzero  current solely due to many - body interactions .",
    "when the spatial dependence of the density of states is of interest , the probe can be used in a regime analogous to a `` scanning - mode '' : the probe can be coupled to the system at any point along its length through a right angle construction , as shown in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : avecurrintinhomo]c shows the occupied and unoccupied ldos of this inhomogeneous lattice as a function of position .",
    "the spatial decrease of the interactions forces particles to the region with small interactions , where at the very end the lattice has an ldos similar to a non - interacting system . just near the non - interacting boundary , however , a large peak in occupied density of states forms , i.e. , states pinned well below the fermi level . on the interacting side , the number of particles is small with an ldos just below the fermi level .",
    "a superimposed even - odd effect is visible , which is due to finite lattice effects , creating oscillations away from the boundaries .",
    "there is a direct correspondence between the particle occupation and the integrated occupied ldos , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : occupation ] .",
    "we conclude by noting that the density of states is a central concept in our description of matter . we have provided an operational definition of the ldos for many - body systems , applicable to in- and out - of - equilibrium cases , fermionic or bosonic systems , etc .",
    "the core principle is that for a current to flow  whether in a steady state or not  into an empty , narrow probe band , there must be occupied states at that energy ( similarly for a full narrow band and unoccupied states ) .",
    "the measurement is resolved in both energy and space , as well potentially in other characteristics ( e.g. , spin - resolved ) .",
    "we demonstrate that a cold - atom setup will allow for the measurement of this operational definition : the many - body ldos can be extracted with minimal disturbance to the system . while cold - atom systems allow for tunability , issues still can arise regarding , e.g. , the orbital character of the local states and higher energy excitations . unlike solid - state systems , however , the effect of these issues can be reduced in this setup .    a related approach , where tunable cold - atom systems are used to more controllably  i.e . , with less disturbance to the native state ",
    "implement eqs .   and , is also beneficial , but the narrow band setup we propose minimizes the total current flowing and all other disturbances , more so than that of the stm . the energy - resolved atomic scanning probe will complement the quantum - gas microscope @xcite , which resolves the spatial location of atoms . moreover , there is also recent interest in using quantum gases to simulate the physics of the early universe @xcite , for which the energy - resolved probe can help shed light on the nature of high - energy excitations and symmetry breaking .",
    "the ability to probe  both experimentally and numerically  the undisturbed density and occupation of states as a function of energy and position illuminates the structure of many - body systems and will help advance the theoretical description of underlying physical processes .",
    "the non - interacting lattice is exactly solvable for both the current and the ldos .",

    "@xmath87 denotes the chosen spin species , and @xmath43 is the filling factor .",
    "the poles of the green s function lead to the energy dispersion , which has the form @xmath88 with @xmath89 giving the two bands : @xmath90 the retarded green s function in real space is @xmath91 . since the green s function is for a uniform , translational invariant system , we may choose @xmath92 . by using the identity @xmath93 with @xmath94 denoting the cauchy principle integral",

    "one may view the prefactors as the weight of wavefunctions at @xmath98 and the delta functions pick the frequencies that matches the two energy bands . in the isolated - site limit",
