    "gravity - assisted agglomeration of planetesimals in the protoplanetary disks around young stars is a backbone of a currently widely accepted paradigm of terrestrial planet formation , despite many uncertainties in the details of specific processes involved . in many respects our understanding of the planetesimal disk evolution",
    "heavily relies on the numerical investigations , and these studies significantly grew in complexity in recent years ( wetherill & stewart 1989 , 1993 ; kenyon & luu 1998 , 2002 ; inaba 2001 ) . on one hand ,",
    "the sheer scale of simulated systems has expanded considerably , which was made possible by the increase in computing power ; on the other hand , a wider range of concomitant physical phenomena ( fragmentation , migration , etc . )",
    "can now be routinely followed simultaneously with the evolution of planetesimal mass and velocity distributions .",
    "unfortunately , very often this complexity creates a problem when one tries to understand a _ relative _ role of each of the specific processes in shaping the planetesimal mass and velocity spectra . disentangling the contributions of different physical nature in the results of numerical simulations",
    "certainly is a tantalizing task which can often yield very confusing conclusions .",
    "thus it is very important to be able to isolate different physical processes operating in the planetesimal disks and to study their effects on the disk evolution separately .",
    "one way to do this is to build simple but realistic models which are easy to analyze and at the same time are able to grasp the main features of the physics involved .",
    "such approach would grant us good analytical understanding of relevant processes , and we are going to follow this route in our study .",
    "behavior of planetesimal velocities is one of the crucial ingredients of the terrestrial planet formation picture because of the very important role played by the gravitational focusing ( which depends on planetesimal velocities ) in assembly of the big bodies in planetesimal disks .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the evolution of inclinations and eccentricities ( which represent planetesimal random velocities ) caused by the mutual gravitational scattering of planetesimals .",
    "this is a clean and well - posed problem .",
    "the effects of gas drag and inelastic collisions are initially neglected but later on we discuss how their inclusion affects our results . to keep things as clear as possible we have opted not to try coupling self - consistently planetesimal velocity evolution to the evolution of the mass spectrum in this study .",
    "instead , we follow changes of random velocities in a disk with a distribution of planetesimal sizes which evolves in some _ prescribed _ manner",
    ". however simplistic this assumption seems to be , in adopting it we try to use mass spectra which are similar to those produced by self - consistent coagulation simulations , and to study a wide variety of such mass distribution models .    another argument in favor of this approach is the fact that the dynamical relaxation time in a disk of gravitationally interacting planetesimals is much shorter than the physical collision timescale ( characterizing evolution of the mass spectrum ) if relative random velocities of planetesimals are smaller than the escape velocities from their surfaces ( which is very often the case ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution of planetesimal disk can then be approximated as that of a system with a quasi - stationary planetesimal mass spectrum .",
    "understanding this problem is a logical step necessary to provide a clearer perspective on how to build a fully self - consistent theory of planet formation .",
    "we describe the statistical approach to the problem of the evolution of planetesimal random velocities in  [ sect : velev ] .",
    "our model of planetesimal mass spectrum is introduced ",
    "[ sect : mass_spec ] . in ",
    "[ sect : scaling ] we outline the results for the distribution of planetesimal random velocities vs. planetesimal masses as functions of the input mass distribution and time ; we also compare these analytical predictions with numerical results .",
    "table [ table2 ] summarizes our major findings in a concise form . in  [ sect : dissipative ] we comment on how gas drag and inelastic collisions between planetesimals can affect planetesimal velocity spectra .",
    "we conclude in  [ sect : disc ] by the discussion of our results and comparison with previous studies .",
    "when the number of planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk is very large and their masses are not sufficient to induce strong local nonuniformities in the disk ( ida & makino 1993 ; rafikov 2001 , 2003b , 2003c ) , statistical approach and homogeneous `` particle in a box '' assumption are very helpful in the treatment of planetesimal evolution ( wetherill & stewart 1989 ) .",
    "we assume that planetesimals with mass @xmath2 have velocity dispersions of eccentricity and inclination @xmath3 and @xmath4 associated with them .",
    "it is natural to characterize planetesimal disk by its mass distribution , and we assume that @xmath5 is the _ surface number density _ of planetesimals with masses between @xmath2 and @xmath6 .    in studying the dynamics of planetesimal disks",
    "we make the following natural assumptions :    * disk is locally homogeneous in radial direction and azimuthally symmetric ; it is in keplerian rotation around central star , * epicyclic excursions of planetesimals in horizontal and vertical directions are small compared with the distance to the central object , * planetesimal masses are much smaller than the mass of the central object @xmath7 .",
    "two important consequences immediately follow from this set of assumptions .",
    "first , the gravitational scattering of planetesimals during their encounter can be studied in the framework of hill approximation ( hnon & petit 1986 ; ida 1990 ; rafikov 2003a ) . in this approach ,",
    "gravitational interaction between two bodies with masses @xmath2 and @xmath8 introduces a natural lengthscale  hill radius^{1/3}$ ] often used in the literature ( e.g. ida 1990 ; stewart and ida 2000 ) . ]",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 is the distance from the central object .",
    "numerical estimate made in ( [ eq : hill ] ) assumes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and is intended to illustrate that typically @xmath13 .",
    "hill approximation yields two significant simplifications :    * the outcome of the interactions between two bodies depends only on their _ relative _ velocities and distances . *",
    "if all relative distances are scaled by @xmath14 and relative velocities of interacting bodies are scaled by @xmath15 , then the outcome of the gravitational scattering depends only on the initial values of scaled relative quantities .",
    "second , numerical studies ( greenzweig & lissauer 1992 ; ida & makino 1992 ) have demonstrated that in homogeneous planetesimal disks the distribution function @xmath16 of absolute values of planetesimal eccentricities @xmath17 and inclinations @xmath18 is well represented by the rayleigh distribution : @xmath19 , \\label{eq : gauss}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the aforementioned dispersions of eccentricity and inclination .",
    "it also follows from azimuthal symmetry that horizontal and vertical epicyclic phases @xmath22 and @xmath23 are distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath24 .",
    "these facts have important ramifications as we demonstrate below .",
    "let s consider the gravitational interaction of two planetesimal populations : one with mass @xmath2 and eccentricity and inclination dispersions @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the other with mass @xmath8 and dispersions @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "when the velocity distribution function of planetesimals has the form ( [ eq : gauss ] ) it can be shown ( rafikov 2003a ) that the evolution of @xmath20 and @xmath21 due to the gravitational interaction with population of mass @xmath8 proceeds according to @xmath27,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_i^2}{\\partial t}=    \\frac{m^\\star}{m+m^\\star}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left [ \\frac{m^\\star}{m+m^\\star}k_1 + 2\\frac{\\sigma_i^2}{\\sigma_i^2 +   \\sigma_i^{\\star 2}}k_2\\right ] , \\label{eq : homog_heating}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the surface number density of planetesimals of mass @xmath8 , and @xmath29 is a measure of shear in the disk [ in keplerian disks @xmath30 . scattering coefficients @xmath31",
    "are defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the dispersions of relative eccentricity and inclination normalized in hill coordinates [ see ( [ eq : hill ] ) ] , @xmath34 is a semimajor axes difference of interacting bodies scaled by @xmath14 , and @xmath35 are the relative eccentricity and inclination _ vectors _ in hill units ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; ida 1990 ) .",
    "function @xmath36 represents a change of @xmath37 produced in the course of scattering , which is a function of not only absolute values of @xmath38 , and @xmath34 , but also of the relative epicyclic phases ( for which reason we use vector eccentricities and inclinations here ) .",
    "the distribution function of relative eccentricities and inclinations of planetesimals @xmath39 is analogous in its functional form to ( [ eq : gauss ] ) , but with @xmath40 replaced by _ relative _ velocity dispersions @xmath41 .",
    "expressions analogous to ( [ eq : stirring_coeffs ] ) can be written down also for inclination scattering coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "note that the only assumption used in deriving ( [ eq : homog_heating ] ) is that of the specific form ( [ eq : gauss ] ) of the distribution function of planetesimal eccentricities and inclinations ( rafikov 2003a ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq : homog_heating ] ) describe dynamical evolution driven only by gravitational scattering of planetesimals , implicitly assuming that they are point masses",
    ". physical size of planetesimal @xmath44 ( for physical density @xmath45 ) is very small compared to the corresponding hill radius ( [ eq : hill ] ) , which often justifies the neglect of physical collisions between planetesimals .",
    "however , at high relative velocities  higher than the escape speed from planetesimal surfaces  one can no longer disregard highly inelastic physical collisions which strongly damp planetesimal random motions . in this study",
    "we proceed by assuming first that velocities of planetesimals are below their escape velocities , and then discussing in  [ sect : dissipative ] how abandoning this assumption affects our conclusions .    equation ( [ eq : homog_heating ] ) and definitions ( [ eq : stirring_coeffs ] ) have been previously derived by other authors in a slightly different form ( wetherill & stewart 1988 ; ida 1990 ; tanaka & ida 1996 ; stewart & ida 2000 ) : @xmath46 .",
    "\\label{eq : ida_form}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this form the first term in brackets on the r.h.s .",
    "describes the so - called _ viscous stirring _ which is proportional to the phase space average of @xmath47 ( see definitions of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) . depending on @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "it can be either positive or negative .",
    "second term represents the phenomenon of _ dynamical friction _",
    "well known from galactic dynamics . in the limit @xmath52",
    "its contribution is proportional to the mass of particle under consideration and to the surface mass density of field particles , but is independent of individual masses of field particles ( cf .",
    "binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "this term is negative since it represents the gravitational interaction of a moving body with the wake of field particles formed _ behind _ it as a result of gravitational focusing ; thus @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "finally , the third term describes the increase of random velocities of a particular body at the expense of random motion of field planetesimals it interacts with .",
    "this effect is analogous to the first order fermi mechanism of the cosmic ray acceleration via scattering of energetic particles by randomly moving magnetic field inhomogeneities ( fermi 1949 ) .",
    "note that in previous studies of planetesimal scattering it is the combination of the second and third terms on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : ida_form ] ) that is called the dynamical friction ( stewart & wetherill 1988 ; ida 1990 ) . the combined effect of these two terms",
    "is to drive planetesimal system to equipartition of random energy between planetesimals of different mass ( which would be realized in the absence of viscous stirring ) .    in this work",
    "we analyze planetesimal velocity evolution with the aid of equation ( [ eq : homog_heating ] ) .",
    "we call the first ( positive ) term on its r.h.s .",
    "_ gravitational stirring _ or _ heating _ ( different from viscous stirring ) , while second ( negative ) term is called _ gravitational friction _ or _ cooling _ ( different from dynamical friction ) . in this sense terms",
    "`` stirring '' and `` friction '' are only used to describe positive and negative contributions to the growth rate of planetesimals random motion .",
    "use of equations ( [ eq : homog_heating ] ) rather than ( [ eq : ida_form ] ) has two obvious advantages : ( 1 ) gravitational stirring and friction have different dependences on @xmath55 which considerably simplifies analysis of velocity evolution equations , and ( 2 ) stirring and friction terms have definite signs ( unlike viscous stirring and dynamical friction used in previous studies of planetesimal dynamics )",
    ".    gravitational scattering of planetesimals can proceed in two rather different velocity regimes , shear - dominated and dispersion - dominated .",
    "the former one is realized when @xmath56 , while the latter holds when @xmath57 .",
    "analytical arguments and numerical calculations demonstrate that in the dispersion - dominated regime @xmath20 and @xmath21 are of the same order and evolve in a similar fashion ( e.g. ida 1990 ; stewart & ida 2000 ) .",
    "this happens because scattering in this regime has a three - dimensional character making different components of velocity ellipsoid comparable to each other .",
    "thus , rough idea of the dynamical evolution in this case can be obtained by studying only one of the equations ( [ eq : homog_heating ] ) . moreover ,",
    "the behavior of the scattering coefficients in the dispersion - dominated regime can be calculated analytically as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath51 in two - body approximation ( stewart & wetherill 1988 ; tanaka & ida 1996 ) , and one finds that @xmath58 where @xmath59 are positive functions of inclination to eccentricity ratio @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is a coulomb logarithm ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , which in our case can be represented as ( rafikov 2003a ) @xmath62 with @xmath63 being some constants .",
    "explicit analytical expressions for coefficients @xmath59 have been derived by stewart & ida ( 2000 ) .",
    "one can deduce a specific useful property of these functions by considering a single - mass planetesimal population : in dispersion - dominated regime the distribution of random energy between the vertical and horizontal motions tends to reach a quasi - equilibrium state ( see e.g. ida & makino 1992 ) .",
    "then the ratio @xmath64 is almost constant and both @xmath65 and @xmath66 grow with time , meaning that [ see ( [ eq : homog_heating ] ) & ( [ eq : h1h2 ] ) ] @xmath67 this property will be used later in  [ sect : scaling ] & [ app : subsect : steep ] .    in the shear - dominated regime @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "evolve along different routes : eccentricity is excited much stronger than inclination because in this regime disk is geometrically thin and forcing in the plane of the disk is stronger than in perpendicular direction .",
    "eccentricity evolution is also quite rapid in this case because of the vigorous scattering ( relative horizontal velocity increases by @xmath68 in each synodic passage of two bodies initially separated by @xmath69 in semimajor axes ) .",
    "simple reasoning confirmed by numerical experiments suggests the following behavior of scattering coefficients in the shear - dominated regime : @xmath70 where @xmath71 are some positive constants , which can be fixed using numerical orbit integrations , see appendix [ app : numerical_procedure ] .",
    "simple qualitative derivation of ( [ eq : h1h2 ] ) and ( [ eq : cold_coeffs ] ) can be found in ida & makino ( 1993 ) and rafikov ( 2003c ) .    for further convenience ,",
    "we now reduce evolution equations to a dimensionless form .",
    "we relate planetesimal masses to the smallest planetesimal mass are not important for the disk evolution . in the case",
    "considered here the choice of @xmath72 is dictated by the mass at which distribution would depart from the given power law form towards shallower scaling with mass ( see also ",
    "] @xmath72 by using dimensionless quantity @xmath73 . instead of @xmath74",
    "we introduce dimensionless mass distribution function @xmath75 such that @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the total _ mass _ surface density of planetesimals in the disk , which is a conserved quantity .",
    "we also rescale eccentricity and inclination dispersions : @xmath78 this is equivalent to rescaling all distances by hill radius of smallest planetesimals . in this notation the boundary between the shear- and dispersion - dominated regimes is given by conditions @xmath79 we also introduce dimensionless time @xmath22 by @xmath80 is a timescale for the stirring of planetesimal disk composed of bodies of mass @xmath72 only , on the boundary between the shear- and dispersion - dominated regimes .",
    "numerically , for @xmath11 one finds that @xmath81 where we assumed that @xmath82 ( hayashi 1981 ) .",
    "dynamical timescale is rather short when @xmath83 , but it grows very rapidly as epicyclic velocities of planetesimals increase ( @xmath84 in the dispersion - dominated regime ) .",
    "random velocities of planetesimals of mass @xmath85 evolve due to the interaction with all other bodies spanning the whole mass spectrum . using our dimensionless notation we can rewrite equations ( [ eq : homog_heating ] ) , ( [ eq : h1h2 ] ) , & ( [ eq : cold_coeffs ] ) in the following general form : @xmath86 , \\label{eq : homog_heating_integr0.5}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial s_z^2}{\\partial \\tau}= \\int\\limits_1^{\\infty}dx^\\star f(x^\\star ) x^\\star(x+x^\\star)^{1/3}\\nonumber\\\\ \\times\\left[\\frac{x^\\star}{x+x^\\star } k_1 + 2\\frac{s_z^2}{s_z^2 +   s_z^{\\star 2}}k_2\\right ] , \\label{eq : homog_heating_integr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and similarly for @xmath88",
    "; in the shear - dominated regime [ @xmath89 @xmath90 and in the dispersion - dominated regime [ @xmath91 @xmath92    we explore this system in  [ sect : scaling ] using two approaches : asymptotic analysis utilizing analytical methods , and direct numerical calculation of velocity evolution .",
    "starting from ( [ eq : homog_heating_integr0.5])-([eq : d - d ] ) one would like to obtain the behavior of @xmath93 and @xmath94 as functions of @xmath85 and @xmath22 , given some planetesimal mass spectrum @xmath75 as an input .",
    "in general , to do this one has to evolve equations ( [ eq : homog_heating_integr])-([eq : d - d ] ) numerically . however , it is usually true that the planetesimal size distribution spans many orders of magnitude in mass ; thus one would expect that some general predictions can be made analytically about the _ asymptotic _ properties of planetesimal velocity spectrum .    in this study",
    "we assume that planetesimal mass distribution has a `` self - similar '' form ; specifically we take @xmath95 where @xmath96 is some fiducial planetesimal mass which steadily grows in time as a result of coagulation , @xmath97 is a temporal modulation , and function @xmath98 represents a self - similar shape of the mass spectrum . we also assume in this study that asymptotically @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "such scaling behavior is often found in coagulation simulations .",
    "we will see in  [ sect : scaling ] that for clarifying the asymptotic properties of planetesimal velocity spectrum it is enough to know only the asymptotic behavior of @xmath101 and not its exact shape . moreover , in ",
    "[ sect : disc ] we demonstrate how our results for power - law size distributions can be generalized for other mass spectra .",
    "normalization @xmath97 is not an independent function .",
    "it is related to @xmath102 because of the conservation of the total ( dimensionless ) planetesimal surface density @xmath103 taking this constraint into account one finds that @xmath104 in the case @xmath105 mass spectrum behaves as @xmath106 for @xmath107 ; only the position of the high mass cutoff @xmath102 shifts towards higher and higher masses with time .",
    "one of the interesting features exhibited by self - consistent coagulation simulations is the development of the tail of high mass bodies beyond the cutoff of the bulk distribution of planetesimals ( wetherill & stewart 1989 ; inaba 2001 ) .",
    "this is interpreted as the manifestation of the _ runaway _ phenomenon taking place in a coagulating system . to explore the possibility of the runaway scenario we add to the mass spectrum ( [ eq : mass_spec ] ) a tail of high mass planetesimals extending beyond the exponential cutoff @xmath115",
    "( see appendix [ app : numerical_procedure ] ) . in doing this",
    "we always make sure that runaway tail contains a negligible part of the system s mass and does not affect its dynamical state ( i.e. stirring and friction caused by these high mass planetesimals are small ) which is true if biggest bodies are not too massive ( rafikov 2003c ) . under these assumptions",
    "the explicit functional form of the runaway tail is completely unimportant . throughout this study",
    ", we use the term `` planetesimals '' for bodies belonging to the power - law part of the spectrum ( @xmath116 ) , and `` massive '' or `` runaway '' bodies to denote the constituents of the tail ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "we do not restrict the variety of possible functional dependences of @xmath115 on time @xmath22 .",
    "it will turn out that all our results can be expressed as some functions of @xmath115 which leads to the time - dependence of planetesimal velocities in a very general form . in some cases",
    "it will be important that @xmath102 does not grow too fast , which , however , we believe is a fairly weak constraint ( see discussion in  4.1.2 ) .",
    "to facilitate our treatment of planetesimal velocities we introduce a set of simplifications into our consideration :    * we split mass spectrum into several regions , such that in each of them planetesimal interactions can be considered as dominated by a single dynamical regime ( shear - dominated or dispersion - dominated ) .",
    "transitions between such regions are not considered but in principle might be treated by interpolation . * when studying the dispersion - dominated regime we neglect the difference between the vertical and horizontal velocity dispersions , and treat them by a single equation .",
    "we also set coulomb logarithm equal to constant , because of its rather weak dependence on @xmath118 or @xmath85 .",
    "the validity and impact of these assumptions on the velocity spectrum are further checked using numerical techniques .",
    "since we are mostly interested in qualitative behavior of solutions , we do not expect numerical constants to be correctly reproduced by our analysis ; they can be trivially fixed using numerical calculations .",
    "mass distributions are parametrized by the value of power law exponent @xmath119 [ see ( [ eq : mass_spec ] ) ] .",
    "we split our investigation according to the value of @xmath119 into @xmath120 cases : _ shallow _ mass spectrum , @xmath121 , _ intermediate _ mass spectrum , @xmath122 , and _",
    "spectrum , @xmath123 ( this regime splits into two more important subcases , see  4.3 ) .",
    "note that for the sake of avoiding additional complications we do not consider borderline cases @xmath124 ; they can be easily studied in the framework of our approach if the need arises .    in our analytical work planetesimals",
    "are started with large enough @xmath93 and @xmath94 so that they interact with each other in the dispersion - dominated regime .",
    "we then also assume that planetesimals with masses @xmath125 ( containing most of the mass ) stay in the dispersion - dominated regime w.r.t .",
    "each other also at later time , i.e. @xmath126 this is a reasonable assumption for all mass spectra at the beginning of evolution , although for steep size distributions it may break down when maximum planetesimal mass becomes very large ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "planetesimal mass distributions shallower than @xmath127 result from coagulation of high - velocity planetesimals , when gravitational focusing is unimportant and collision rate is determined by geometrical cross - section of colliding bodies ( wetherill & stewart 1993 ; kenyon & luu 1998 ) .",
    "it is worth remembering however that in highly dynamically excited disks ( 1 ) energy dissipation in inelastic collisions must be important , see  [ sect : dissipative ] , and ( 2 ) planetesimal fragmentation can not be ignored . despite that , the case of shallow mass spectrum is interesting because it facilitates understanding of the disks with other planetesimal size distributions .",
    "we start by considering planetesimals , @xmath125  part of the size distribution containing most of the mass . regarding them as interacting in the dispersion - dominated regime [ i.e. the condition ( [ eq : condit ] )",
    "is fulfilled ] we may write using ( [ eq : homog_heating_integr ] ) & ( [ eq : d - d ] ) that @xmath128 \\label{eq : dd_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath107 . since we use a single equation to describe the evolution of both @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the values of constants @xmath129 are not well defined but this is not important for deriving general properties of the velocity spectrum",
    ".    we can represent ( [ eq : dd_eq ] ) asymptotically in the following form : @xmath130 .",

    "represent correspondingly the gravitational stirring and friction by bodies smaller than @xmath85 .",
    "the last term is responsible for the combined effect of stirring and friction produced by bodies bigger than @xmath85 . from this equation",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath131 independent of @xmath85 is a legitimate solution of ( [ eq : dd_eq1 ] ) in the case @xmath121 . indeed , assuming @xmath93 to be independent of @xmath85 we find that all integrals over @xmath132 in ( [ eq : dd_eq1 ] ) are dominated by their upper limits when mass spectrum is shallow . using ( [ eq : s_sim])-([eq : red_m_def ] )",
    "we can estimate that @xmath133 note that in deriving this expression we have extended the integration range of the last term in ( [ eq : dd_eq1 ] ) from @xmath134 to infinity ( not from @xmath135 ) .",
    "this is legitimate because this integral is dominated by the contribution coming from @xmath136 and , thus , adding interval from @xmath134 to @xmath135 to integration range would introduce only a subdominant contribution to the final answer . clearly , two first terms in ( [ eq : dd_eq2 ] ) are negligible compared to the third one for @xmath137 , and third term is positive [ see ( [ eq : property ] ) ] and independent of @xmath85 , meaning that @xmath131 is also independent of mass , in accord with our assumption .",
    "one can then easily find that the velocity dispersion of smallest planetesimals and @xmath138 is different for different mass spectra , see ( [ eq : vel_spec2 ] ) and ( [ eq : vel_spec4 ] ) below . ]",

    "the second equality holds only for @xmath121 , according to ( [ eq : time_func ] ) & ( [ eq : red_m_def ] ) .",
    "thus , in the case of mass spectrum shallower than @xmath141 random velocities are independent of planetesimal masses and uniformly grow with time .",
    "both gravitational stirring and friction are dominated by biggest planetesimals ( @xmath142 ) , with stirring being more important ; friction by small bodies is completely negligible and energy equipartition between planetesimals of different mass is not reached .",
    "for this reason , planetesimal velocity expressed in physical units using ( [ eq : s_def ] ) , ( [ eq : tau ] ) , & ( [ eq : vel_spec1 ] ) is independent of the choice of @xmath72 .",
    "a schematic representation of velocity spectrum for the shallow mass distribution is displayed in figure [ fig : shallow ] .",
    "now we turn our attention to the runaway bodies , @xmath143 . by assumption , this tail contains so little mass , that it can not affect velocities not only of planetesimals but also of runaway bodies themselves .    because of our assumption of the dispersion - dominated interaction between all planetesimals with @xmath116 it is natural to expect that at least those runaway bodies which are not too heavy still experience dispersion - dominated scattering by planetesimals with masses @xmath144 . assuming that the velocity dispersion of these runaway bodies is much smaller than that of the bulk of planetesimals",
    " natural consequence of the tendency to equipartition of random epicyclic energy between bodies of different mass  we can rewrite ( [ eq : dd_eq ] ) as @xmath145 although the integration range of all terms in the r.h.s .",
    "is extended to infinity , the exponential cutoff of @xmath75 at @xmath146 effectively restricts the integration range to be from @xmath134 to @xmath146 .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath147 can not be a solution of ( [ eq : dd_eq_tail ] ) because dynamical friction is too strong .",
    "indeed , if we were to assume the opposite , we would find that @xmath148 is still given by ( [ eq : vel_spec1 ] ) .",
    "however , direct substitution of ( [ eq : vel_spec1 ] ) into ( [ eq : dd_eq_tail ] ) shows that the gravitational friction term exceeds other contributions for @xmath143 .",
    "this might tempt one to suggest that heating ( first ) term in r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : dd_eq_tail ] ) should be neglected compared to the friction ( second ) term . in this case",

    "effect of the collisions should be most pronounced for small planetesimals for which relative encounter velocities can be much higher than their @xmath264 .",
    "threshold mass at which highly inelastic collisions become important must constantly increase in time as planetesimal disk is heated up by massive planetesimals .",
    "one should also remember that planetesimal fragmentation in high velocity encounters may become important in this regime which would significantly complicate simple picture we described here .    in summary ,",
    "dissipative effects are unlikely to affect the dynamics of massive planetesimals .",
    "however , they become important for small mass planetesimals and lead to positive correlation between random velocities of planetesimals and their masses ( unlike the case of pure gravity studied in  [ sect : scaling ] ) , which has been previously observed in self - consistent coagulation simulations ( wetherill & stewart 1993 ) .",
    "it is thus fairly easy to modify our simple picture developed in ",
    "[ sect : scaling ] to incorporate the effects of gas drag and inelastic collisions .",
    "although our study has concentrated on a particular case of power - law size distributions ( most of the mass is locked up in the power - law part of the planetesimal mass spectrum ) its results have a wider range of applicability .",
    "the reason for this is that the velocity scalings derived in ",
    "[ sect : scaling ] depend only on what part of planetesimal spectrum dominates stirring and friction and not on the exact shape of mass distribution .",
    "for example , suppose that @xmath265 does not have a self - similar power law form of the kind studied in  4.2 ( intermediate mass spectrum ) but its first moment @xmath185 is still dominated by the smallest masses ( most of the mass is locked up in smallest planetesimals , which dominate friction ) , while the second moment @xmath266 is mainly determined by highest masses ( heating is determined by biggest planetesimals @xmath146 ) .",
    "then it is easy to see from our discussion in  4.2.1 that the velocity distribution has a form of a broken power - law in mass , changing its slope from @xmath195 at small masses to @xmath196 at high masses [ see ( [ eq : vel_spec2 ] ) and ( [ eq : vel_spec3 ] ) ] . if , on the contrary , most of the mass is not in smallest bodies but in largest ones ( @xmath185 and @xmath266 converge near the cutoff of planetesimal spectrum , @xmath146 ) , then both friction and stirring are dominated by biggest planetesimals and velocity spectrum must have zero slope for the entire range of planetesimal masses , in accord with our consideration of shallow mass distributions (  4.1.1 ) . whenever both stirring and cooling of planetesimals of mass @xmath2 are dominated by planetesimals of similar mass",
    ", we go back to the case 1 of  4.3 . finally , in all cases",
    "when stirring and friction are produced by planetesimals much smaller than those under consideration , velocity profile scales like @xmath267 ( energy equipartition , see case 2 in  4.3 ) .",
    "similar rules can be derived on the basis of the results of  [ sect : scaling ] for more complicated mass spectra , and this makes our approach very versatile .",
    "one of the interesting features found in our study of purely gravitational scattering ( see  [ sect : scaling ] ) is the development of a plateau at the low mass end of planetesimals velocity distribution for shallow and intermediate mass spectra ( @xmath221 ) .",
    "these mass spectra are among the most often realized in the coagulation simulations which makes this prediction quite important for interpretation of numerical results .",
    "one should be cautious enough not to confuse these plateaus with the manifestations of dissipative processes such as gas drag or inelastic collisions which tend to endow velocity distribution with only very weak ( positive ) dependence on mass , see  [ sect : dissipative ] .",
    "another observation which can be made based on our results is that the bulk of planetesimals ( power law part where most of the mass is locked up ) rarely reaches a complete equipartition in energy .",
    "equipartition is realized when @xmath268 , or in our notation @xmath269 .",
    "our calculations (  4.3 ) show that when @xmath116 such a velocity spectrum is only possible for very steep mass distributions , @xmath234 , when both dispersion - dominated stirring and friction are due to the smallest planetesimals with masses @xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "mass distributions that steep are not often encountered in self - consistent coagulation or n - body simulations ( wetherill & stewart 1993 ; kenyon 2002 ; kokubo & ida 1996 , 2000 ) and yet the equipartition argument is very often used to draw important conclusions about the bulk of planetesimal population ( see below ) .    at the same time , random energy equipartition is ubiquitous for runaway bodies in the high mass tail ( @xmath143 ) if they still interact with the rest of planetesimals in the dispersion - dominated regime .",
    "since , by our assumption , runaway tail contains very little mass , this equipartition is very similar to the case of @xmath234 , because in both situations stirring as well as friction are driven by planetesimals much lighter than the bodies under consideration .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that this conclusion changes when runaway bodies start interacting with small planetesimals in the shear - dominated regime ( see e.g.  4.1.2 ) .",
    "although we did not follow the evolution of the planetesimal mass spectrum self - consistently we can already constrain some of the theories explaining mass distributions in coagulation cascades .",
    "for example , n - body simulations of gravitational agglomeration of @xmath270 massive planetesimals by kokubo & ida ( 1996 , 2000 ) produce roughly power law mass spectrum with an index of @xmath271 within some range of masses . to explain this result makino ( 1998 ) explored planetesimal growth in the dispersion - dominated regime with strong gravitational focusing .",
    "they postulated epicyclic energy to be in equipartition and found that planetesimal mass distribution has a power - law form with a slope of @xmath272 .",
    "however , using the results of  4.2.1 one can immediately pinpoint the contradiction with the basic assumptions which lead to this conclusion .",
    "indeed , slope of @xmath273 corresponds to the intermediate mass spectrum ( see  4.2 ) which can never reach energy equipartition .",
    "moreover , this mass spectrum can not even have a power - law velocity distribution with a continuous slope necessary for a theory of makino ( 1998 ) to work . as a result ,",
    "the explanation provided by these authors for the mass spectrum found in n - body simulations can not be self - consistent .",
    "more work in this direction has to be done .    although theory developed in ",
    "[ sect : scaling ] is in good agreement with our numerical calculations , one should bear in mind that our analytical results are asymptotic by construction , i.e. they are most accurate when planetesimal disk has evolved for a long time and when planetesimal size distribution spans a wide range in mass ( this can be easily seen by comparing figures [ fig : num_2.3 ] and [ fig : num_2.7 ] )",
    ". real protoplanetary disks during their evolution might not enjoy the luxury of having such conditions been fully realized ; this can complicate quantitative applications of our results to real systems .",
    "we believe however that this does not devalue our analytical results because they provide basic understanding of processes involved in planet formation , allow one to clarify important trends seen in simulations , and enable quick and efficient classification of possible evolutionary outcomes for a wide range of parameters of protoplanetary disks .",
    "several previous studies have concentrated on exploring velocity equilibria in systems with nonevolving mass spectra in which inelastic collisions between planetesimals acted as damping mechanism necessary to balance gravitational stirring ( kaula 1979 ; hornung , pellat , & barge 1985 ; stewart & wetherill 1988 ) .",
    "we have outlined a qualitative picture of the effects of dissipative processes in ",
    "[ sect : dissipative ] and it agrees rather well with these previous investigations .",
    "n - body calculations and `` particle in a box '' coagulation simulations represent another class of studies in which velocity distributions have been routinely computed . as we already commented in  [ sect : intro ] these calculations usually absorb a lot of diverse physical phenomena which makes them not easy targets for comparisons .",
    "still , there are several generic features almost all simulations agree upon such as ( 1 ) roughly power - law mass spectra typically with slopes @xmath221 within some mass range , ( 2 ) velocity dispersion is constant or slowly increases with mass for small planetesimals , and ( 3 ) it decreases with mass for large bodies .",
    "this general picture is in good agreement with our analytical predictions .",
    "we have carried out an exhaustive census of the dynamical properties of planetesimal disks characterized by a variety of mass distributions . here",
    "we briefly summarize our results for the case velocity evolution driven by gravitational scattering of planetesimals .",
    "whenever planetesimal mass distribution in a disk has a power law slope shallower than @xmath274 , we find that planetesimal velocity is constant up to the upper mass cutoff . for slopes between @xmath274 and @xmath275 velocity dispersions",
    "are constant at small masses but switch to @xmath276 dependence above some intermediate mass . as a result ,",
    "mass spectrum exhibits a pronounced `` knee '' at this mass .",
    "distributions with slopes between @xmath275 and @xmath277 have purely power - law velocity spectra with slope @xmath278 satisfying @xmath279 , which can be determined numerically using equation ( [ eq : i1i2_cond ] ) . finally , planetesimals in disks characterized by mass spectra steeper than @xmath0 are in energy equipartition , i.e. velocity dispersions scale as @xmath267 . such a difference in behaviors",
    "is caused by the fact that gravitational stirring and dynamical friction receive major contributions from different parts of planetesimal mass spectra in different cases .",
    "we also consider a possibility that mass distribution has a tail of massive `` runaway '' bodies sticking out beyond the exponential cutoff of the power - law mass spectrum .",
    "we have found that the low mass end of the tail experiencing dispersion - dominated scattering by all planetesimals exhibits complete energy equipartition : @xmath268 .",
    "most massive runaway bodies interact with all planetesimals in the shear - dominated regime , which leads to highly anisotropic velocity distributions of these bodies : @xmath280 while @xmath281 .",
    "time dependence of velocities is determined mainly by the evolution of the cutoff of the power law mass spectrum @xmath282 .",
    "these asymptotic results derived using analytical means are in good agreement with numerical calculations of planetesimal dynamical evolution presented in ",
    "[ sect : scaling ] .",
    "they can be easily generalized to cover more complicated planetesimal mass distributions .",
    "finally , we investigate qualitatively the impact of damping processes such as gas drag or inelastic collisions on the planetesimal disk dynamics .",
    "we find that manifestations of these effects are only important for small mass planetesimals ; they exhibit themselves in the form of gentle increase of planetesimal random velocities with mass which has been previously observed in `` particle in a box '' coagulation simulations ( wetherill & stewart 1993 ) .",
    "future work in this direction should target the self - consistent coupling of the evolution of planetesimal velocities to the evolution of mass spectrum of planetesimals due to their coagulation .",
    "successful solution of this problem would greatly contribute to our understanding of how terrestrial planets grow out of swarms of planetesimals in protoplanetary disks .",

    "runaway tail is assumed to have a power - law form with the same slope @xmath119 but much smaller normalization than planetesimal mass distribution .",

    "initial distribution of planetesimal eccentricities and inclinations is set to @xmath295 .",
    "in the case of intermediate mass spectrum runaway bodies with masses @xmath85 between @xmath200 [ defined in ( [ eq : x1def ] ) ] and @xmath153 interact with small planetesimals [ less massive than @xmath203 defined by ( [ eq : xsx_def ] ) ] in the dispersion - dominated regime , but with large ones ( heavier than @xmath203 ) in the shear - dominated regime . as a result , the equations for @xmath93 and @xmath94 are now hybrid versions of ( [ eq : dd_eq_tail ] ) and ( [ eq : sd_eq ] ) : @xmath296 following the approach taken in  4.1.2 we neglect l.h.s . of both equations and use ( [ eq : vel_spec2 ] ) and ( [ eq : vel_spec3 ] ) to evaluate integrals in evolution equations .",
    "after careful comparison of different contributions in the r.h.s .",
    "we find that @xmath297 equation ( [ eq : hybrid1 ] ) implies that eccentricity stirring of runaway bodies in the mass range @xmath298 is done mainly by planetesimals with masses @xmath146 , for which the interaction proceeds in the _",

    "converges at the upper end of its range , near @xmath115 .",
    "when @xmath207 this integral is contributed roughly equally by equal logarithmic intervals in mass between @xmath300 and @xmath146 ; then the second term in the l.h.s . of ( [ eq : hybridz1 ] )",

    "substituting our guess ( [ eq : assume ] ) into ( [ eq : dd_eq ] ) and going through all possibilities appropriate for @xmath123 we find that self - consistent solutions of power - law type can exist in only two cases :            in this case one can easily see that integrals in the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : dd_eq ] ) are mostly contributed by @xmath231 .",

    "a self - consistent power - law solution for @xmath93 exists only if integral in ( [ eq : dd_eq6 ] ) is equal to zero .",
    "this leads to the following constraint on the required value of @xmath232 : @xmath313 solving this equation for given @xmath119 and @xmath314 one can find the slope of the mass spectrum @xmath315 . at a first sight it is not at all clear that equation ( [ eq : i1i2_cond ] )",
    "should in general possess a solution for @xmath232 .",
    "however , closer look at the problem reveals some interesting patterns .",
    "first of all , it follows from ( [ eq : property ] ) that r.h.s . of ( [ eq : i1i2_cond ] )",
    "has to be bigger than @xmath134 .",
    "second , in the case of energy equipartition @xmath316 .",
    "third , @xmath317 as @xmath318 , while @xmath319 stays finite .",
    "these observations prove that ( [ eq : i1i2_cond ] ) _ always _ has a solution for @xmath232 satisfying the constraint posed by equation ( [ eq : constr ] ) . combining restriction ( [ eq : constr ] ) with initial constraints of case 1 we find that case 1 is only possible for mass spectra with power law slope @xmath230 .",
    "in fact , one can do things even better by considering separately eccentricity and inclination scalings with mass , i.e. using both equations ( [ eq : homog_heating_integr ] ) .",
    "assuming that the ratio of inclination to eccentricity @xmath320 is still constant for @xmath116 , one would obtain in addition to ( [ eq : i1i2_cond ] ) another equation dictated by the inclination evolution .",
    "it would be identical to ( [ eq : i1i2_cond ] ) , but with @xmath129 replaced by @xmath321 . since both @xmath129 and @xmath321 depend only on @xmath320 ( see  [ sect : velev ] )",
    "one would have two equations for two unknowns : @xmath232 and @xmath320 .",
    "solving them one can uniquely fix both the power law index of planetesimal velocity dependence on mass and the ratio of inclination to eccentricity of planetesimals ( which is left undetermined in our simplified analysis of  [ sect : scaling ] ) .",
    "restrictions imposed on @xmath119 and @xmath232 by the conditions of case 2 imply that all integrals in the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : dd_eq ] )",
    "are dominated by the lower end of their integration range , i.e. by masses @xmath322 . neglecting time derivative in ( [ eq : dd_eq ] ) and balancing contributions in the r.h.s .",
    "we find that @xmath235 and @xmath323 this solution demonstrates that for @xmath312 our omission of the l.h.s . of ( [ eq : dd_eq ] )",
    "is justified for arbitrary behavior of @xmath102 .",
    "it also imposes important restriction on the mass spectra for which this scaling can be realized : @xmath119 mus be bigger than @xmath324 .",
    "this means that we have found solutions for all possible positive values of @xmath119 and our study is complete in this sense .",
    "velocity evolution of runaway bodies in the case 1 is similar to the situation with the intermediate mass spectrum .",
    "one finds that when mass @xmath85 satisfies @xmath325 velocity profile is shaped by the dispersion - dominated interaction with _ all _ small mass planetesimals ( @xmath116 ) : @xmath326 the biggest contribution to both stirring and dynamical friction comes the most massive planetesimals with masses @xmath146 .",
    "going to heavier bodies , @xmath327 , one finds scattering to be in mixed state : some planetesimals [ those heavier than @xmath328 interact with big bodies in the shear - dominated regime while the other part ( those lighter than @xmath329 ) is in the dispersion - dominated regime relative to runaway bodies .",
    "it turns out that when @xmath230 the biggest contributors to both the heating and friction of big bodies are planetesimals of mass @xmath300 .",
    "since this is just at the boundary between the shear- and dispersion - dominated regimes , one can expect @xmath94 to behave in the same way as @xmath93 does [ similar to ( [ eq : vel_tail_spec8 ] ) ] .",
