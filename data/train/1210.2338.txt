    "micrornas ( mirnas ) are 21 - 23 nucleotides ( nt ) long , endogeous , non - coding rna molecules , that perform post - transcriptional regulation by specifically binding target messenger rnas ( mrnas ) , typically leading to a reduction in the levels of the corresponding proteins @xcite .",
    "they are transcribed from independent mirna genes or from introns of protein - coding transcripts . after being processed into maturity , a mirna",
    "is loaded onto a specialized class of proteins to form the rna - induced silencing complex ( risc ) , which specifically binds mirna response elements ( mres ) located in target mrnas ( usually in their 3 untraslated region or 3-utr ) through a base - pairing recognition mechanism which requires at least 6-nt complementarity .",
    "the whole process , known as rna interference ( rnai ) , results in gene silencing through translation inhibition and mrna destabilization @xcite .",
    "each mrna can typically interact with several mirnas , and each mirna can target many different mrnas . within the complex network of potential interactions that ensues , mirnas have long been thought to function mainly as fine - tuners for regulation by weakly dampening the protein output @xcite .",
    "this view is supported by the fact that the statistically over - represented motifs ( feed - forward or feed - back loops ) that have been identified in the known mirna ",
    "mrna interaction network are indeed capable of buffering the noise level in the output layer ( proteins ) @xcite .",
    "more recently the attention has been directed to system - level effects . in particular , it has been realized that mirna - based regulation is strongly affected by global properties like the total concentration of available targets ( a feature known as _ dilution effect _",
    "the combination of the repressive effects of mirnas on their targets and of the weakening of such repression due to dilution effects lead to effective , positive interactions between joint targets of a given mirna ( _ cross - talk interactions)_. in addition , it is now known that pseudo - genes and other long non - coding rnas ( lncrnas ) also possess mres and can be bound by the risc .",
    "this implies that , besides mrnas , non - coding rnas sharing identical mres compete for common mirnas @xcite .",
    "thus , mirnas appear to mediate the cross - talk between a broad class of competing endogenous rnas ( cernas ) which includes both mrnas and lncrnas commonly targeted by mirnas , leading to a large - scale network of indirect interactions across the transcriptome @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that such interactions play a central role in many biological contexts , from muscle differentiation @xcite to cancer @xcite .    despite the body of experimental evidence , a clear quantitative understanding of mirna - mediated regulation is still lacking . to address this issue",
    ", we formulate a minimal model of post - transcriptional regulation and analyze its steady state , aiming at quantifying the intensity of the interactions arising from competition through an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in the cerna transcription rates .",
    "we show that binding free energies and repression mechanisms are the key ingredients for the cross - talk between cernas to arise .",
    "the emergent interactions can be symmetrical ( one cerna influences another and vice - versa ) or asymmetrical ( one cerna influences another but not the reverse ) and may be highly selective , although possibly hampered by noise .",
    "we furthermore argue that the identification of cross - talk from gene expression data can be hindered by the fact that statistically significant correlations among cernas can emerge in the experimental readouts simply due to transcriptional fluctuations .",
    "we start by considering a highly simplified system formed by @xmath0 different species of cerna molecules , labeled @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , targeted by a single mirna species labeled @xmath3 .",
    "each @xmath1 can reversibly bind @xmath3 in complexes labeled @xmath4 . conforming to the experimental evidence @xcite",
    ", we assume that translational repression is fast and precedes mrna destabilization , implying that complexes can not be translated and repression of translation simply occurs by sequestration of free cernas . taking a constant translation rate , the levels of unbound cerna can be used as a direct proxy for protein concentrations at steady state .",
    "the allowed processes with their respective rates are then as follows ( see fig .",
    "1 ) :     cerna species and one mirna.,width=302 ]      note that complexes are assumed to be degraded either through a catalytic channel ( which gives back the mirna to the cytosol ) or through a stoichiometric channel ( where both molecules are degraded with the complex ) . this choice serves the purpose of keeping the model as general as possible .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 measures the degree of stoichiometricity of complex decay : it ranges between @xmath7 ( in case of fully catalytic degradation , @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 ( in case of fully stoichiometric degradation , @xmath10 )",
    ". it will play an important role in our theory and we will refer to as _",
    "stoichiometricity ratio. _ the exact mechanism of target repression is still a matter of debate , and in the past years several mechanisms have been reported @xcite .",
    "generically , mirnas incorporated into the risc do not seem to decay with their target , thus becoming again available for a new round of target rna silencing .",
    "nevertheless complexes may enter in specific cellular structure - like p - bodies thus resulting in an effective stoichiometric sequestration of both the mirna and the target .",
    "clearly , this setup represents a coarse - graining of the real biological processes , which typically requires multiple catalyzed elementary steps ( e.g. in the formation of the risc ) .",
    "however , such details may be disregarded if , in presence of many different targets , the only rate - limiting factor is the mirna concentration .",
    "this will indeed be our main assumption ( together with the fact that @xmath1 s can only interact through @xmath3 ) .",
    "on the other hand , one sees that the quantity @xmath26 defined in ( [ tre ] ) ( which only depends on the kinetic parameters of cerna @xmath1 ) gives the mirna level for which the concentrations of free cernas and of complexes equal half of their theoretical maxima .",
    "therefore , in practice , we have the following situation :    1 .",
    "if @xmath27\\ll\\mu_{0,i}$ ] ( or @xmath27/\\mu_{0,i}=\\mathcal{o}(\\epsilon)$ ] ) , then @xmath28\\simeq m_i^\\star$ ] and @xmath29\\ll c_i^\\star$ ] : here the levels of free cernas are largest , while complexes are roughly absent ; spontaneous degradation is the dominant channel of cerna decay .",

    "it is reasonable to expect that in cases a. and c. the steady state level of free cerna @xmath28 $ ] will only be weakly sensible to ( small ) variations in @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "we shall call these regimes ` free ' and ` bound ' ( @xmath33and @xmath34 for brevity ) , respectively . in case b. , instead , the microrna concentration lies in the dynamical range of @xmath35 , so that @xmath28 $ ] will respond to ( small ) variations in @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "we will the call this regime ` susceptible ' ( @xmath36 for brevity ) .",
    "the outlook is that once the kinetic parameters of the cernas are given , the @xmath26 s are given as well , and the mirna level suffices to know whether a cerna is in the @xmath33 , @xmath36 or @xmath34 regime .",
    "biologically reasonable values of the model parameters ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 as used in @xcite ) suggest that @xmath39 should approximatively have nanomolar order of magnitude , which is comparable to the range of mirna concentrations @xcite .",
    "note however that analysis of the rnai enzyme complex has shown that its kinetics can vary substantially across different targets and that it is strongly affected by the degree of complementarity @xcite .",
    "this means that , in principle , different targets may have very different @xmath26 s and may thus be located in distinct regimes of regulation at fixed @xmath27 $ ] and that the three states ( @xmath40 ) are actually assumed by cernas . furthermore , different mirnas species may have concentrations spanning many orders of magnitude in a given cell type @xcite . for instance",
    ", it has been experimentally demonstrated that only the most abundant mirnas have significant impact on gene expression and mediate target suppression @xcite , suggesting that cernas are free from mirnas when their regulators have very low concentrations .",
    "moreover , it has been observed that protein production in presence of mirna is highly repressed below a given threshold level for mrna transcriptional activity and it responds sensitively to transcription above this threshold @xcite , suggesting the transition from an unexpressed , bound regime to an expressed , susceptible one .    to illustrate the emergent interactions between cernas , we plot in figure 2 the steady - state levels of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath3 as a function of @xmath43 in a system with @xmath44 in which all other kinetic parameters are fixed .",

    "the dynamical range of the cross - talk interaction between the two cernas corresponds to the window where free and bound molecules have similar concentration , i.e. to the @xmath36 regime .",
    "parameters for this case ( in their respective units ) are as follows : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54.,width=321 ]    one clearly sees that , even within this basic model , a change in the transcription rate of a cerna can affect the steady state concentration of a different cerna .",
    "the shaded area in the top panel of figure 2 highlights the difference between the steady state level of cerna2 with or without ( i.e. for @xmath55 ) its competitor @xmath41 : @xmath56 $ ] is sensible to variations of @xmath43 ( via the change of the free mirna concentration @xmath27 $ ] , which is correspondingly dropping ) only in an intermediate , narrow interval .",
    "we will show that the intensity of such a cross - talk depends on the regimes to which the cernas belong .",
    "in essence , strong interactions can be achieved only ( i ) ( symmetrically ) between cernas in the @xmath36-regimes , and ( ii ) ( asymmetrically ) from a cerna in the @xmath34-regime to a cerna in the @xmath36-regime .",
    "this scenario will define a selective , possibly asymmetric channel of communication which links cernas targeted by a common mirna .",
    "our goal here is to characterize cross - talk interactions quantitatively by computing the ` susceptibilities ' ( @xmath57 ) @xmath58}{\\partial b_j}~~,\\ ] ] which for @xmath59 measure the magnitude of the interaction between cerna @xmath1 and cerna @xmath60 . using ( [ sseq ] )",

    "finally , for @xmath59 all of the elements of @xmath87 are of order @xmath89 or smaller except @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which are of order 1 .",
    "this implies that , in this scenario , two types of effective interactions arise : the first one encodes the response of a cerna in the @xmath36-regime to a perturbation of another cerna in the @xmath36-regime , and it is symmetric ; the second one encodes the response of a cerna in the @xmath36-regime to a perturbation of a cerna in the @xmath34-regime , and it is not symmetric ( i.e. perturbing the ` susceptible ' cerna the ` bound ' one will not respond ) .    in words",
    ", the scenario described here corresponds to a linear response theory in which a change in the transcription rate of a cerna ( i.e. @xmath92 ) induces a shift in @xmath93 $ ] ( i.e. @xmath93\\to [ m_j]+\\chi_{jj}\\delta b_j$ ] with @xmath94 ) and a shift in the level of mirna ( i.e. @xmath27\\to[\\mu]+\\chi_{\\mu j}\\delta b_j$ ] with @xmath95 ) . in turn , this affects @xmath28 $ ] ( i.e. @xmath28\\to [ m_i]+\\chi_{ij}\\delta b_j$ ] with @xmath96 ) .",
    "so for instance if @xmath97 then @xmath93 $ ] increases , @xmath27 $ ] decreases and @xmath28 $ ] increases .",
    "the quantities @xmath98 can be seen to induce a hierarchy of interactions : cernas in the @xmath34-regime ( higher binding affinity ) can unidirectionally affect cernas in the @xmath36-regime , which in turn may influence other cernas in the @xmath36-regime . on the other hand , cernas in the @xmath33 regime ( lower binding affinity ) interact weakly with the rest of the system and fluctuations in their transcription rates do not propagate to other cernas .",
    "it is important to remark that cross - talk appears only when the mirna level is in a specific range , implying that the structure of the emergent interaction network is flexible and dynamical : the set of cerna species that interact may change upon varying @xmath27 $ ] .    the emergence of selectivity and directionality as features of the cross - talk can be seen in a concrete case in figure 3 , where we plot the susceptibilities for a system of @xmath99 cernas .     in a system of @xmath99 cernas , as a function of mirna transcription rate @xmath100 (",
    "all other parameters being fixed ) . in this example cernas",
    "are cast in two groups : group a , formed by cernas @xmath41 and @xmath101 , and group b , formed by cernas @xmath42 and @xmath102 .",
    "cernas belonging to the same group share identical kinetic parameters . in particular , @xmath103 .",
    "while for @xmath100 smaller than about 500 no cross - talk is observed , as @xmath100 increases a symmetric interaction between cernas in group a ( of magnitude comparable to the self - susceptibilities ) appears : @xmath104 .",
    "as @xmath100 increases further , this interaction is switched off , and cernas in group b begin to cross - talk instead : @xmath105 . in this region , a change of transcription of a cerna in group a can affect the level of cernas in group b , but not viceversa ( asymmetric cross - talk ) : @xmath106 .",
    "finally , for sufficiently large @xmath100 all no cross - talk takes place.,width=321 ]    one sees that different interactions are switched on in different ranges of values for the mirna transcription rate , leading to a gradual modification of the structure of the interaction network as @xmath100 changes .",
    "notice that heterogeneity in the quantities @xmath26 leads to interaction asymmetry",
    ". a schematic summary of the cross - talk in this system is given in figure 4 .",
    "we notice that the intensity of the cross - talk described by ( [ chitot ] ) is modulated by the factor @xmath107 } \\simeq \\frac{b_i w_j } { 4 [ \\mu]\\delta + \\sum_{k\\in \\mathcal{s } } b_k w_k}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath27\\simeq \\mu_{0,k}$ ] for @xmath108 and neglected the contribution to @xmath27 $ ] due to cernas in the @xmath33-regime ( see ( [ muu ] ) ) , which is of order @xmath89 .",
    "again , we see that an effective interaction requires some degree of stoichiometric degradation : if @xmath109 ( i.e. if the complex decays in a purely catalytic manner ) the cross - susceptibility vanishes .",
    "in addition , ( [ kjh ] ) suggests that the magnitude of the interaction is weakened only by cernas lying in the @xmath36-regime , so that , even in presence of a large number of interacting cerna species , cross - talk can be large if the overall population of cernas in the @xmath36-regime is restricted . on the other hand",
    ", many factors , such as the overall population of cernas in the @xmath34-regime , affect the rate of mirna transcription required in order for a given cerna to be susceptible .",
    "a rough approximate expression for the range @xmath110 of values of the mirna transcription rate where cerna @xmath1 is most responsive to the mirna can be derived considering as ` susceptible ' a window @xmath111 of @xmath27 $ ] values such that @xmath112<3\\mu_{0,i}/2 $ ] .",
    "if so , then @xmath113 where we used @xmath114 .",
    "one sees that @xmath115 mainly depends on the transcription rate of the overall population of cernas in the susceptible regime and on the degree of stoichiometricity of degradation .",
    "finally , we observe that an analogous cross - talk scenario emerges for a system in which @xmath116 mirna species share the same target rna : the level of a mirna species may be highly susceptible to a change in the transctiption rate of a different mirna when the level of the target rna lies in a specific window ( for details see section _ the mirror system : one target , m mirna species _ in the supporting text ) .          by analogy with the case @xmath139 , we will say that a cerna is free with respect to mirna @xmath117 ( and write @xmath142 ) if @xmath143\\ll\\tilde\\mu_{0,i\\alpha}$ ] ; it will be ` susceptible ' with respect to @xmath117 ( or @xmath144 ) if @xmath143\\simeq \\tilde\\mu_{0,i\\alpha}$ ] ; it will be ` bound ' with respect to @xmath117 ( or @xmath145 ) if @xmath143\\gg\\tilde\\mu_{0,i\\alpha}$ ] . note that being bound with respect to a mirna species is sufficient for a cerna to be translationally repressed . for consistency , a cerna can only be bound with respect to one mirna species ( in that case it will be free with respect to all other mirnas ) . separating the different regimes we have @xmath146^{-1}(1-[\\mu_\\alpha]/\\tilde\\mu_{0,i\\alpha } ) & i\\in \\mathcal{f}(\\alpha)\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}[z_{i}^{(\\alpha)}]^{-1}[1-(\\mu-\\tilde\\mu_{0,i\\alpha})/(2\\tilde\\mu_{0,i\\alpha } ) ] & i\\in\\mathcal{s}(\\alpha)\\\\ \\tilde \\mu_{0,i\\alpha}/[\\mu_\\alpha ] & i\\in \\mathcal{b}(\\alpha ) \\end{cases}\\ ] ] in turn , for the levels of free mirnas we obtain @xmath147\\simeq\\frac{\\beta_\\alpha-\\sum_{i\\in \\mathcal{b}(\\alpha ) } b_i   w_{i\\alpha }   -\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{i\\in \\mathcal{s}(\\alpha ) } b_i w_{i\\alpha}}{\\delta_\\alpha+ \\sum_{i\\in \\mathcal{f}(\\alpha ) } b_i \\tilde z_{i\\alpha}+ \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{i\\in \\mathcal{s}(\\alpha ) } b_i \\tilde z_{i\\alpha}}\\ ] ] where @xmath148 and @xmath149 $ ] .",

    "cross - talk of the type discussed so far may either result in an amplification of upstream fluctuations or represent an efficient noise buffering mechanism . to analyze this issue in some detail , we focus on the role of transcriptional noise , the primary cause of variability in gene expression among cells in isogenic populations @xcite . if one assumes that extrinsic transcriptional noise is the dominant source of stochasticity and neglects molecular noise entirely , it is possible to estimate concentration fluctuations in the cerna - mirna networks at steady state , obtaining expressions valid in the linear response regime .",

    "more refined detection methods are likely to be needed in order to identify cross - talk among cernas from gene expression data .",
    "recent experimental studies have suggested that the mirna - mediated competition between cernas could constitute an additional level of post - transcriptional regulation , playing important roles in many biological contexts .",
    "trying to achieve a clear quantitative understanding of the emergence of this effect has been the goal of this work .",
    "we have presented a minimal , rate equation - based model that is able to describe the cross - talk arising from competition at steady state through a systematic analytical characterization of the sensitivity to small changes in the transcription rates . to keep mathematical complexities to a minimum",
    ", we have adopted a coarse - grained view of the real biological process , even neglecting details of the mirna - mediated regulation that could impact the emergence of cross - talk among cernas .",
    "for instance , binding to the argonaute / ago protein ( the catalytic component of the risc ) may represent a significant rate - limiting step @xcite , and the competition for ago has been shown to contribute to the emergence of cerna - cerna cross - talk @xcite .",
    "the emerging scenario , valid in the linear response regime , is rather rich and complex .",
    "interestingly , the competitive interactions can give rise to a rather selective communication channel : only cernas in an intermediate , susceptible regime are responsive to mirna perturbations and significantly contribute to diluting the strength of the interaction .",
    "thus , even in case of a dense mirna - cerna network , the resulting cerna - cerna cross - talk pattern may be rather sparse .",
    "moreover , interactions switch on only in specific ranges of mirna concentrations , so that the structure of the emergent cerna - cerna network can adjust in response to variations in the mirna levels . perhaps unexpectedly ,",
    "heterogeneity of kinetic parameters can give rise both to symmetric and asymmetric couplings .",
    "furthermore , an analogous cross - talk scenario emerges between different mirna species sharing the same target rna . and , finally , the topology of the cerna - mirna network may play an important role as strong correlations in connectivity in that network can enhance the cerna - cerna cross - talk .",
    "the above picture requires that mirna - cerna complexes decay , at least partially , through a stoichiometric channel of degradation : for purely catalytic decay no cross - talk is possible at stationarity , and perturbations of transcription rates only cause a transient response .",
    "dynamical effects may nevertheless play an important role on the time - scales of many cellular processes , and will be explored in a forthcoming work .    in order to evaluate the robustness of the mirna - mediated coupling",
    ", we have also performed a basic analysis of the impact of noise .",
    "assuming extrinsic transcriptional noise as the dominant source of stochasticity , we estimated level fluctuations in the cerna - mirna networks at steady state , again obtaining expressions valid in the linear response regime .",
    "it turns out that mirna - mediated cross - talk , coupled with correlated transcriptional inputs , represents a powerful noise processing mechanism that can lead to either noise reduction or amplification .",
    "it is interesting to observe that a circuit displaying specific transcriptional correlations has been discussed in @xcite , where a muscle - specific mirna ( mir-133b ) embedded in a non - coding transcript ( linc - md1 ) has been identified .",
    "clearly , linc - md1 s transcript acts as a very efficient decoy for mir-133b . a theory for this case",
    "is worked out in section _ the mirna - decoy transcript _ of the supporting text",
    ".    it would be important to carry the analysis of the role of noise beyond the steps discussed here .",
    "post - transcriptional regulation based on stoichiometric repression has been shown to cause large intrinsic fluctuations in intermediate regimes of repression @xcite , effectively posing a limit to the possibility of having an efficient quantitative signaling between cernas .",
    "our analysis suggests on the other hand that cross - talk mediated by large number of mirnas might be more robust",
    ". a more thorough mathematical / computational analysis , including molecular noise , may be able to shed light on this important aspect .",
    "we have finally shown that non - trivial correlations among cernas can emerge in experimental readouts due to transcriptional fluctuations even in absence of mirna - mediated cross - talk .",

    "<S> it has recently been suggested that the competition for a finite pool of micrornas ( mirna ) gives rise to effective interactions among their common targets ( competing endogenous rnas or cernas ) that could prove to be crucial for post - transcriptional regulation ( ptr ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied a minimal model of ptr where the emergence and the nature of such interactions can be characterized in detail at steady state . </S>",
    "<S> sensitivity analysis shows that binding free energies and repression mechanisms are the key ingredients for the cross - talk between cernas to arise . </S>",
    "<S> interactions emerge in specific ranges of repression values , can be symmetrical ( one cerna influences another and vice - versa ) or asymmetrical ( one cerna influences another but not the reverse ) and may be highly selective , while possibly limited by noise . </S>",
