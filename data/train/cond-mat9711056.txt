    "in recent years one observes a renewed interest in the metal - insulator transition of the mott - hubbard type , with a particular emphasis on the effect of orbital degeneracy and associated with it hund s rule coupling , both appearing as additional factors @xcite .",
    "this interest is induced by the new works on perovskites @xcite , nis@xmath4se@xmath5 @xcite , as well as on the canonical system v@xmath6o@xmath7 @xcite . in most of these compounds",
    "one observes an anomalous metallicity even in the paramagnetic state @xcite . among them",
    "is the metamagnetism and a relatively strong applied magnetic field dependence of thermodynamic properties @xcite , in addition to the field induced metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "these phenomena of localization occur in compounds of various crystal structure and even in the same magnetic phase , as in the case of nis@xmath4se@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , it seems that the underlying microscopic mechanism is rather general , neither strongly dependent on a particular crystallographic structure , nor on the form of the density of states near the fermi energy and the type of magnetism .",
    "additionally , electronic properties of the system nis@xmath4se@xmath5 are well described by considering a half - filled @xmath8 band @xcite composed of @xmath9 states ( due to ni@xmath10 ions ) , which hybridize with completely filled @xmath11 states due to s@xmath12 or se@xmath12 ( the last states are believed to play only a passive role near mit ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to carry out a simplified analysis for a system composed of orbitally degenerate but otherwise equivalent band states that nonetheless addresses some of the principal phenomena in an applied magnetic field and at nonzero temperature .",
    "thus , one can examine the system behavior as a function of experimentally controllable parameters .",
    "the analysis of mott - hubbard localization in the nondegenerate band case was based on the hubbard model and provides a continuous transition at @xmath13 @xcite and a discontinuous transition at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these results were subsequently confirmed in the limit of infinite dimensions @xcite .",
    "this means that this quantum phase transition possesses an upper critical dimension and the gutzwiller approach represents a correct mean - field theory .",
    "also , close to the localization , depending on the band filling , one observes metamagnetism @xcite or metamagnetic behavior @xcite , spin - split effective masses @xcite , and a transition from an antiferromagnetic semimetal to an antiferromagnetic insulator @xcite .",
    "the related gutzwiller approximation scheme for a doubly degenerate hubbard model provides a discontinuous transition already at @xmath13 @xcite , a change induced by the hund s rule coupling .",
    "obviously , the hund s rule should make the localization easier ( i.e. diminish the critical value @xmath14 of the intraatomic interaction ) , since it favors energetically the high - spin atomic state against any normal fermi - liquid state . hence , we can separate the effects associated with the coulomb interaction from those due to the hund s rule coupling .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce a slave - boson approach combined with the hartree - fock approximation for the hunds - rule term , which reproduces in a simple manner the similar results of the full slave - boson analysis by hasegawa @xcite in the paramagnetic state for zero field and temperature .",
    "additionally , this representation provides a correct expression of the energy a fermionic quasiparticles in the applied magnetic field . within this scheme",
    "we determine the magnetic susceptibility , metamagnetic properties , spin - dependent effective masses , as well as determine the mott - hubbard boundary at nonzero temperature , and its shift towards lower temperatures in the applied field .",
    "the similarities and differences with the nondegenerate - band case are stressed . in the second part",
    "we propose a simple rotationally invariant formulation of the problem for an arbitrary orbital degeneracy of electron states and compare it with the gutzwiller approach . within this approach ,",
    "a difference between the hund s rule and intersite magnetic coupling appears naturally , although the last point is not discussed in detail in the present paper .",
    "the correlated metal - paramagnetic insulator transition takes place at any integer filling @xmath15 and is discontinuous for @xmath16",
    "doubly degenerate hubbard model in the situation with equivalent orbitals is described by hamiltonian :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the annihilation operator of electron from lattice site @xmath19 on orbital @xmath20 and with spin @xmath21 @xmath22 is the particle number and @xmath23 is the spin operator , @xmath24 is the hopping integral , assumed for simplicity the same for the two orbitals ( we choose also @xmath25 ) .",
    "parameters @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 are respectively , the intraband coulomb , the interband coulomb and the hunds - rule - exchange integrals . for @xmath8 band",
    "we have : @xmath29 finally , in the last term @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the applied magnetic field . because of the vanishing orbital moment in the first order , the magnetic field affects the spin degrees only ( we neglect also the landau quantization effects for low fields ) .",
    "we make the mean - field approximation for the exchange term .",
    "likewise , we decouple in the same manner the interorbital term , since @xmath32 therefore , we have    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the average value of operator @xmath35 with hamiltonian @xmath36 :    @xmath37    in this equation we have added the chemical potential part @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the number of electrons in the system .",

    "we employ the slave boson representation of kotliar and ruckenstein @xcite in the form :    @xmath47    where we introduced new boson - fermion vacuum @xmath48 instead of the fock - space vacuum @xmath49 .",
    "so , we have added only the orbital index to the original formulation .",
    "the operators @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are boson operators and @xmath53 is fermion operator .",
    "this representation must be supplemented by the constraints    @xmath54    and    @xmath55    relation between original @xmath56 and new @xmath57 fermion operators is :    @xmath58    the constraints given by eqs .",

    "equivalently , one could utilize the bose representation @xmath65 but then only the z - component is well defined and the result in the saddle - point approximation does not provide the quasiparticle energies with the proper zeeman term ( see the discussions of this point in ref.6b , where the full spin rotation invariant form of the sb representation is invoked ) .",

    "we see also a typical reentrant metallic behavior at high temperatures .",
    "namely , with rising temperature the system evolves from a metal through an insulator back to the metallic state . in the inset",
    "we display the temperature dependence of the free energies for pm and pi states .",
    "the shape of the phase boundary is essentially the same as in nondegenerate - band case @xcite .",

    "the upper part of the curve is only qualitative , particularly if realistic dos is used , as higher - order contribution in @xmath209 will become important .",
    "in fact , the solution of the hubbard model in infinite - dimension limit @xcite provides only a crossover behavior , not a weakly discontinuous retrograde behavior .",
    "one may ask if the low-@xmath1 analysis is realistic , since in the mean - field slave - boson analysis the low - energy spin fluctuations ( quantum gaussian fluctuations around the saddle - point here ) have been neglected .",
    "those spin fluctuations lead to the contribution @xmath224 in the free energy @xcite .",
    "this contribution is of higher order than the @xmath225 contribution coming from the quasiparticle excitations across the fermi surface .",
    "therefore , the analysis is realistic , but only to the leading order in low-@xmath1 expansion , as we have done it .",
    "the evolution of the almost localized fermions discussed above for the half - filled band case can be explained nicely from a physical point of view .",
    "namely , for @xmath226 the renormalized band ( @xmath227 ) and the correlation ( @xmath228 ) energies _ almost compensate each other . _ in such situation , much smaller entropy ( @xmath229 ) or applied field ( @xmath230 ) energies tip the balance towards either m or i phase . explicitly ,",
    "at low temperatures , the spin - disordered magnetic insulator has much larger entropy contribution ( @xmath231 per orbital ) than that of the almost localized fermi liquid ( @xmath232 , with @xmath233 ) .",
    "this circumstance tips the balance from pm state ( with @xmath234 but small entropy contribution ) towards pi state ( with @xmath235 but much larger entropy contribution ) . at much higher temperatures",
    "the balance is tipped back towards pm phase , since eventually the entropy of the metallic state grows and approaches the asymptotic value @xmath236 per orbital .",
    "thus the reentrant metallic behavior is driven by the entropy .",
    "it is observed in both ( v@xmath237cr@xmath5)@xmath238o@xmath7 @xcite and nis@xmath4se@xmath5 @xcite systems .",
    "it can be applied also to explain the low - temperature reentrant liquid behavior in liquid @xmath239he @xcite . in our view",
    "the reentrant behavior appearing either as a crossover or as a discontinuous transition ( @xmath239he ) uniquely present in the mott - hubbard systems defined as systems , for which the band and the coulomb parts of their energy almost compensate each other .",
    "the exchange contribution tips the balance further towards the localized state .",
    "obviously , the first - order nature of the transition will lead to the coexistence of the two phases , with localized and itinerant electrons , respectively .",
    "however , this mixed phase can be discussed only when the magnetism is included , and we will not elaborate on it here .",
    "as mentioned at the beginning , the present formulation represents for @xmath240 a simplified version of the full slave - boson and gutzwiller treatments @xcite discussed recently . in fig.8",
    "we have compared the hartree - fock ( hf ) , ours ( sb - hf ) and full slave - boson ( sb ) results for the ground state energies for @xmath106 and @xmath241 the arrows denote the position of the mott - hubbard boundary in the two latter schemes .",
    "the energy difference diminishes rapidly with growing @xmath219 the difference for physical quantities is only quantitative , not qualitative , though the sb approach @xcite has slightly lower energy , since it contains many more variational parameters . in the next section",
    "we extend the main features of our solution to arbitrary @xmath242 and higher degeneracy @xmath2 of equivalent orbitals and an arbitrary filling .",
    "we now generalize the principal features of our argument to the case of orbital degeneracy .",
    "first , we represent the intraatomic part in terms of global ( site ) representation . for that purpose",
    "we start from the following expression of that part    @xmath243    where now @xmath244 and @xmath245 assume the values @xmath246 , and the primed summation is taken for @xmath247 we introduce the global spin and particle number operators through the relations    @xmath248    and    @xmath249    we have the following relations between global and previously introduced operators    @xmath250    and @xmath251    hence , up to constant @xmath252 takes the form    @xmath253    where @xmath254    for particular example of @xmath8 band we have    @xmath255    the first term represents charge fluctuations , the second the atomic hund s rule .",
    "moreover , unlike in a nondegenerate band the intraorbital intraatomic ( hubbard ) parameter ( @xmath256 ) is much smaller than @xmath117 additionally , the first two terms are proportional to @xmath150 while the third is @xmath257 hence , the last term can become the smallest , particularly for highly degenerate systems .",
    "in general , the hamiltonian ( [ 6 ] ) expresses the so - called minimum polarity model of van vleck ( charge fluctuations suppressed by growing @xmath258 ) , as well as the separation of the dynamic processes into inequivalent charge and spin degrees of freedom in the effective one - band model introduced by hubbard @xcite . for highly degenerate systems we can approximate    @xmath259    noting that    @xmath260    where @xmath261 is unit vector along an arbitrarily oriented spin quantization axis for the spin @xmath262 one has finally    @xmath263    where @xmath264 for a particular case of a nondegenerate band @xmath265 ,",
    "@xmath266 we recover the earlier results @xcite with @xmath267 and @xmath268 for @xmath269 the last term is absent and the correlated paramagnetic state at @xmath13 is described by two variational parameters :    @xmath270    and @xmath271    note that in this section @xmath41 represent the local - moment magnitude .",
    "the third parameter describing the long - range order is obtained by making the hartree - fock approximation @xmath272    the collinear magnetic ordering is expressed then through @xmath273 since in this section we consider only a paramagnetic state at @xmath274 we neglect in our analysis the last term .",
    "note however , that the present parameters @xmath275 @xmath41 and @xmath276 for arbitrary @xmath2 correspond directly to the parameters @xmath277 @xmath278 and @xmath279 in the preceding section ( @xmath280 is removed via the completeness condition @xmath281      in direct analogy to the doubly degenerate case discussed in section ii , we express the ground state energy in the form    @xmath283    where now the band narrowing factor @xmath145 depends on @xmath284 and @xmath285 represent the average band energy for a degenerate system . without a loss of generality one can assume that @xmath286 in accordance with our simple derivation of the mean - field ( gutzwiller ) approach in the half - filled band case @xcite we make an expansion :    @xmath287    and @xmath288    note that @xmath289 the expansion has the meaning of a landau expansion , and the coefficients can be determined by calculating @xmath290 explicitly in limiting situations .",
    "for example , in the hartree - fock approximation we have @xmath291 and thus elementary analysis provides us with    @xmath292    and @xmath293 where @xmath40 is the band filling ( @xmath294 corresponds to the half - filling ) .",
    "analogously , for @xmath295 and @xmath296 the quantities @xmath297 and @xmath298 will approach their atomic values @xmath299",
    "@xmath300    @xmath301    and @xmath302    additionally , applying the equilibrium conditions    @xmath303    we obtain the expression    @xmath304 , \\\\ m & = & m_0\\left [ 1+\\frac j{2g_2m_0\\left| \\bar{\\epsilon}\\right| \\lambda \\left ( \\lambda \\right ) } \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as in nondegenerate case , the charge fluctuations are suppressed with increasing @xmath305 on the contrary , the magnetic moment grows with increasing @xmath306 additionally , using the conditions @xmath307 we obtain that    @xmath308    the coefficients @xmath309 and @xmath310 are determined from the condition that for any integer band filling @xmath311 we have that @xmath312 and @xmath313 ( this result is valid for the paramagnetic configuration only and reflects the pauli exclusion ) .",
    "so , finally we have    @xmath314    and @xmath315    substituting these expressions to the expression ( [ speg ] ) for @xmath140 we obtain the explicit form in the terms of variational variables @xmath284 and",
    "@xmath151 making use of the conditions @xmath316 we arrive at the algebraic equations , which may be transformed into the following equations for the functions @xmath317 and @xmath318 taken at the extremal points :    @xmath319 + g\\frac{\\tilde{u}}{u_0}\\left ( \\frac{\\tilde{u}}{u_0}-2\\right ) -\\left ( \\frac{\\tilde{u}}{u_0}\\right ) ^2=0,\\ ] ]    and @xmath320 + \\lambda \\frac j{j_c}\\left ( \\frac j{j_c}% + 2\\right ) -\\left ( \\frac j{j_c}\\right ) ^2=0,\\ ] ] with @xmath321 and @xmath322 these two equations can be transformed into each other by changes @xmath323 @xmath324 and @xmath325 hence , it is sufficient to solve numerically one of them and adapt it subsequently for the second equation .",
    "one should notice that the nondegenerate - band - case result @xmath326 ( i.e. @xmath121 ) is recovered for @xmath327    before going into the numerical analysis let us summarize the above subsection .",
    "we have developed a relatively simple scheme of calculating the magnitudes of local moment @xmath328 and of the charge fluctuations @xmath329 which is equivalent to gutzwiller - brinkman - rice scheme @xcite for @xmath330 these magnitudes are calculated from a relative balance between the renormalized band energy from one side , and the correlation energies ( @xmath331 ) from the other .",
    "the method involves an interpolation between low- and high - correlation regimes ( note that the mean - field slave boson theory requires such an interpolation to the @xmath332 limit @xcite ) .",
    "we define the reduced variables    @xmath333    and @xmath334    in this manner , the values @xmath335 corresponds to the hartree - fock approximation , whereas the limit with @xmath336 correspond to the exact atomic limit , which for an integer @xmath311 corresponds to the mott - hubbard insulator . in fig.9",
    "we have plotted @xmath290 as a function of @xmath337 for @xmath338 which corresponds to @xmath339 the bare band energy for the featureless density of states is @xmath340 one sees that @xmath341 for a critical value of @xmath342 at this point the values @xmath343 and @xmath344 are reached for @xmath3 in a discontinuous way , as illustrated in figs.10ab .",
    "the localization threshold diminishes with @xmath345 this is because the band energy varies roughly @xmath346 while the interaction energy is @xmath347 the transition to the localized - moment state is determined by the interplay between the exchange and the coulomb interaction .",
    "this is illustrated in figs.11ab , where the band - narrowing factors @xmath318 and @xmath317 have been specified . in most situations",
    "the part @xmath348 changes from its hartree - fock value only a little .",
    "this provides an a posteriori justification of the hartree - fock approximation for the exchange term .",
    "the dominant role of the term @xmath349 over the hund s rule term gives some support to the interpretation of the local - moment formation in the terms of a nondegenerate hubbard model .",
    "this becomes clear if one notices that in that case    @xmath350    and hence @xmath351 correspond to the limit @xmath121 ( @xmath352 ) .",
    "in the situation depicted in fig.11a @xmath353 at the transition . however , unlike in nondegenerate system , the spin - charge fluctuation coupling is leading to the discontinuous character of this transition for @xmath16    the discontinuous nature of the metal - insulator transition induces only a weak enhancement of the effective mass close to the transition ( the curves in fig.10b are physically meaningful only below the discontinuity points ) .",
    "the results in this respect are valid universally for arbitrary @xmath354 and @xmath355",
    "in this paper we have put an emphasis on the similarities and differences of the mott localization in degenerate - band system with the extensive analysis of mit existing for the nondegenerate band case . for that purpose",
    "we have made in the first part the hartree - fock approximation for the exchange interaction .",
    "this approximation is applicable in the limit when @xmath256 is substantially smaller than @xmath26 as is usually the case for @xmath9 bands .",
    "this scheme provides us with the physically plausible conclusion that the metal - insulator transition is mainly driven by the intraatomic coulomb interaction ; the intraatomic exchange is responsible for the first - order nature of the transition already at @xmath356 also , with this approach one can see that the correlated systems , whether orbitally degenerate or not , can in the mean - field approximation be described as systems of fermionic quasiparticles with spin - split masses ( in the magnetically polarized state ) and a nonlinear molecular field coming from the correlations , in addition to the usual exchange field .",
    "the fundamental question is whether the present approach ( as well as those listed in ref.1 ) provide a proper mean - field theory of a correlated state near the metal - insulator transition .",
    "it seems so and the proper order parameter in the orbitally nondegenerate paramagnetic system is either @xmath357 or @xmath150 , which are nonzero in the metallic phase and vanish in the insulating state .",
    "what is more important , since for @xmath195 the band - narrowing factor @xmath145 in pm state can be directly related @xcite to the physical quantity @xmath358 representing the discontinuity of the fermi - dirac distribution at the fermi energy , the order parameter is a measurable quantity for this quantum phase transition at @xmath356 in the magnetically ordered state the system is additionally characterized by a staggered moment @xmath359 in the second part of this paper we have shown that even in the paramagnetic state the orbitally degenerate system is additionally characterized by the parameter @xmath328 describing the local moment magnitude .",
    "thus , in our view , the set of the parameters : @xmath360 @xmath361 and @xmath362 compose a _",
    "minimal set _ describing the metal - insulator transition in the degenerate system and associated with it magnetic transition ( in nondegenerate system @xmath363 ) .",
    "obviously , the full slave boson and gutzwiller approaches @xcite provide an essentially the same qualitative picture , although contain more parameters , which are eliminated by implementing the constraints appearing as consistency conditions . in this respect ,",
    "our simplified approach provides a didactical guidance for more complicated analysis .",
    "for example , the effect of quantum gaussian fluctuations in auxiliary bose fields neglected so far will introduce intersite exchange interactions , which will not introduce any additional order parameter , though the detailed thermodynamic properties will contain the contribution coming from the interaction between the quasiparticles with the novel characteristics ( @xmath364 @xmath365 @xmath366 ) , which appeared on the mean - field level .",
    "the slave boson approach has been recently extended @xcite to describe the antiferromagnetic phase in the doubly degenerate hubbard model . however , the temperature dependence of mit in the paramagnetic phase is still important , since in nis@xmath4se@xmath5 @xcite one observes a transition to the semiconducting phase upon heating the system , when system crosses the nel point ( cf .",
    "fig.7 for @xmath367 , where m@xmath368i transition is observed upon heating the system ! ) .",
    "the detailed analysis requires the discussion of antiferromagnetic insulating and metallic states at @xmath0 before any direct comparison with the experiment is made .",
    "we see that for @xmath387 the susceptibility is always rising with temperature .",
    "note that for dos smoothly varying around the fermi energy this increase is solely due to the correlations and corresponds to the approaching the localization boundary depicted in fig.7 . in the nondegenerate case and for @xmath146",
    "the corresponding brinkman - rice formula reads :      now we derive @xmath150 in small magnetic field and temperature .",
    "because of time reversal symmetry @xmath150 depends only on even power of @xmath219 we determine nonvanishing term @xmath389 at @xmath356 substituting into eq .",
    "( [ ded ] ) first the expression for @xmath41 in the first order of @xmath157 given by ( [ m2hj ] ) and subsequently differentiating twice , thus obtained formula we see that doubly - occupancy probability diminishes with growing @xmath1 and/or @xmath157 according to :",

    "namely , one has @xmath431 , where @xmath432 is a constant divergent at the localization point .",
    "this increase is connected with the narrowing of the band with the growing field ( @xmath433 ) .",
