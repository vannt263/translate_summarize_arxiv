    "one of the most remarkable achievements of the _ chandra _ x  ray observatory is the serendipitous discovery of bright , extended x  ray emission from large scale agn jets , thanks to its exceptional angular resolution .",

    "ray emission is strongly correlated with the jet s radio morphology . in low  power and/or misaligned sources such as radio galaxies ( both of the fri and frii types ) , as well as some bl lacs",
    ", the observed x  ray flux is usually consistent with an extrapolation of the non  thermal synchrotron emission responsible for the radio and optical data . on the other hand ,",
    "the x  ray flux observed in the beamed and powerful extended jets of flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) is several orders of magnitude above such an extrapolation , and therefore in these jets a second radiative component is required .",
    "the origin of this second radiative component is still debated .",
    "both ssc and bremsstrahlung are easily ruled out due to unphysical requirements ( chartas et al . 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , in analogy with the standard leptonic model for the core region of radio  loud agn , tavecchio et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and celotti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) proposed that the high energy emission is due to external inverse compton ( ec ) scattering of soft photons by the same population of electrons responsible for the low ",
    "frequency synchrotron emission . for extended jets hundreds of kiloparsecs",
    "away from the host galaxy , the only viable target photon field is the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the ec / cmb model has been used to successfully fit the seds of several fsrq jets ( tavecchio et al .",

    "2005 , jester et al .",
    "2006 , uchiyama et al .",
    "2006 , meyer and georganopoulos 2014 , meyer et al .",
    "2015 ) , and in some of these works alternative radiative models have been proposed .",
    "a key requirement of the ec / cmb model is that the jet needs to remain highly relativistic ( @xmath1 ) on very large scales ; in this case , the energy density of the cmb is boosted by a factor @xmath2 , making ec / cmb an efficient radiative mechanism capable of reproducing the bright fluxes observed in the _ chandra _ band .",
    "the requirement of a highly relativistic jet naturally implies strong relativistic beaming ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "therefore , in this paper we only focus on the jets of fsrqs , and ignore radio galaxies and ssrqs , for which strong beaming is not expected .",
    "the goal of this paper is to re - examine some aspects of the ec / cmb model , in order to reconcile it with recent data and to provide predictions testable with current and upcoming instruments .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in  2 we review the state of the ec / cmb model , and discuss possible alternatives to it ; in  3 we illustrate our updated ec / cmb model ; in  4 we apply our new model to two notable sources ; in  5 we discuss the implications of our new model , and in  6 we draw our conclusions .    throughout the paper ,",
    "the following cosmological parameters are assumed : @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "despite its early success and general acceptance , in recent years the ec / cmb model has come under criticism from several authors .",
    "the two main issues raised are the diffuse emission problem ( tavecchio and ghisellini 2003 ) and the missing @xmath0ray problem ( meyer and georganopolous 2014 , meyer et al .",
    "2015 ) ; further arguments against the ec / cmb model come from in  depth study of individual sources that show complex behavior ( in particular 3c273 , jester et al .",
    "2006 ; uchiyama et al .",
    "2006 ; and pks1136135 , sambruna et al . 2004",
    "; sambruna et al . 2006 ; cara et al .",
    "2013 ) , for which x  ray spectral data and optical polarimetry shows that a significant part of the high energy flux is produced by electron synchrotron emission .",
    "notably , such behavior is not seen in other well studied sources like pks 0637752 and pks 1150 + 497 ( chartas et al .",
    "2000 ; mueller and schwartz 2009 ; sambruna et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "a point in favour of the ec / cmb model comes from the recent serendipitous discovery of a bright x  ray jet in the intermediate redshift ( @xmath8 ) quasar b3 0727 + 490 .",
    "simionescu et al .",
    "( 2015 ) reported the detection of the jet with the _ chandra _ telescope , despite the lack of an extended radio counterpart .",
    "such behavior is fairly intuitive in the context of an external compton model ( schwartz 2002 ) , as the cmb energy density strongly increases with redshift , and therefore we expect unusually bright x  ray jets at higher redshifts ( @xmath9 ) which are not observed in the current sample of closer sources ( @xmath10 ) .      the diffuse emission problem results from considering particle cooling in the emitting knots ( tavecchio and ghisellini 2003 ) . if the x  ray flux is produced by ec / cmb , the electrons up scattering the cmb need to have low energies ( @xmath11 ) , much lower than those producing the observed radio ( @xmath12 ) or ir - optical emission ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "because the radiative cooling time scale depends on electron energy ( @xmath14 ) , we would expect to observe different morphologies in different bands .",
    "the ir and optical emission , produced by high energy electrons , would come from very compact zones , while radio and especially x  ray emission should come from more diffuse regions .",
    "we would also expect to observe relic knots that are leftovers of aged particle populations , and therefore bright in x ",
    "rays but faint in radio and optical bands .",
    "such a behavior hasnt been observed ; available radio , optical and x  ray data generally shows that the emission regions looks remarkably similar at very different wavelengths ( sambruna et al .",
    "2004 ; sambruna et al .",
    "2006 ; marshall et al .",
    "however , this could be caused by selection bias in the current sample of extended jets with available x - ray data ( see sec .",
    "5 for further discussion ) . a small amount of diffuse x  ray emission unrelated to the radio knots",
    "is sometimes observed ( sambruna et al .",
    "2004 ; sambruna et al .",
    "2006 ; schwartz et al .",
    "2006 ; perlman et al .",
    "2011 ) , but such detections are somewhat tentative except for two jets ( jorstad and marscher 2004 ; simionescu et al .",
    "2016 ) ; typically the emission regions in the radio and x ",
    "rays appear very similar .",
    "a possible solution is the existence of unresolved clumps in the jets ( tavecchio & ghisellini 2003 ) . if the emission region is a few orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath15 cm size typically assumed , and rapidly expanding , then adiabatic cooling can dominate over radiative losses .",
    "adiabatic cooling is independent of particle energy , and therefore electrons with different lorentz factors can cool at nearly identical rates . as a result , jet knots would have the same size in every observed band .",
    "however , we find this explanation to be unsatisfactory due to energy budget requirements .",
    "jet power is typically computed for each knot as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the radius of each emitting region , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the energy densities of the magnetic field , electrons and protons , respectively ( celotti and fabian 1993 ) .",
    "one cold proton per electron is assumed . for a given magnetic field and bulk lorentz factor , we need the same total number of particles in order to produce the observed synchrotron and ec luminosities .",
    "therefore , by changing the size of the emitting region , we change the particle density ( but not the magnetic energy density , assumed to be constant ) .",
    "if the emitting region is assumed spherical , we have that @xmath21 , and thus @xmath22 .",
    "the magnetic power is instead always @xmath23 .",
    "[ power ] illustrates this point .",
    "small emitting regions ( for example , @xmath24 cm rather than @xmath25 cm ) correspond to higher kinetic powers .",
    "the same argument also holds if each knot contains several clumps instead of one : the electron energy density necessarily increases because the same number of electrons is concentrated in a smaller volume .",
    "however , regardless of the number of clumps the number of particles is constant , and so their contribution to the jet s energy remains unchanged .",
    "therefore the _ average _ power of the jet ( energy per unit of time ) remains constant .",
    "-0.7 cm ) and magnetic field ( @xmath26 @xmath27 g ) .",
    "the blue , green and red dash - dotted lines correspond to the power carried by electrons , protons and magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the black lines represent the total power in a single knot including the proton rest - mass energy density ( thick black line ) or excluding it ( dashed black line ) .",
    "smaller radii correspond to extremely high power .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]      the @xmath0ray issue originates from recent _ fermi_/lat data .",
    "the low magnetic fields invoked by the ec / cmb model require high energy electrons ( @xmath28 ) to reproduce the observed optical flux ; these electrons should scatter cmb photons to gev energies ( @xmath29 hz ) .",
    "the ec / cmb model therefore predicts that extended jets should be fairly powerful gev emitters .",
    "however the extended jet emission is still 12 orders of magnitude more faint than the bright quasar core , and the _ fermi_/lat telescope does not have the angular resolution necessary to resolve the two components .",
    "therefore , timing  based techniques are required : the bulk of the emission originating from blazars comes from small emission regions , and is therefore highly variable ; on the other hand , the knots observed likely originate in large emitting regions , and therefore they are not expected to show significant variability on time scales of a few years . in their recent work , meyer and georganopolous ( 2014 ) and meyer et al .",
    "( 2015 ) analyzed the 6year light curves from the 3fgl catalogue of two fsrqs : pks0637752 and 3c273 .",
    "for both objects they claim that _ fermi _ did not detect a steady emission component , presumably associated with the extended jet , and that the available upper limits to this emission are lower than the predictions of ec / cmb , thus ruling it out .",
    "this is a rather strong point against the standard ec / cmb model , particularly in the case of pks 0637752 , which historically has been considered the benchmark extended fsrq jet .    in light of these findings",
    ", the interest in alternative emission models has increased .",
    "the two favoured candidate models invoke a more complex synchrotron model for the high energy component , either due to radiative cooling ( dermer and atoyan , 2002 ) from a separate population of electrons ( uchiyama et al .",
    "2005 , uchiyama et al .",
    "2006 , jester et al .",
    "2006 ) , or from very energetic protons ( aharonian , 2002 ) .",
    "these models can satisfactorily reproduce the observed seds , but suffer from two drawbacks : the presence of a second population of emitting particles is a rather ad  hoc assumption , and they are incapable of producing predictions that can be tested in the short term with current or upcoming instruments ( meyer et al .",
    "nevertheless , they remain a viable alternative .",
    "historically , the sed of extended jets has been computed by assuming an ad  hoc shape for the electron distribution ( either a single or a broken power law ) , in order to reproduce the observed fluxes and spectral indices with reasonable physical parameters ( e.g. sambruna et al .",
    "2006 ) . in this work",
    "instead we compute the evolution of an injected electron distribution by solving the continuity equation , accounting for both radiative and adiabatic cooling , in order to study the evolution of extended jets as a function of both time and redshift .",
    "this approach leads to more robust and consistent estimates of key quantities , such as the synchrotron peak luminosity and frequency . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the entirety of the observed emission comes from a single spherical  blob \" of radius @xmath30 , moving with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath31 and expanding adiabatically with a speed @xmath32 .",
    "we define @xmath33 as the number of electrons with a given lorentz factor @xmath0 , contained in a spherical blob of radius @xmath30 and with an initial radius @xmath34 .",
    "the blob is assumed to be moving with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath31 .",
    "the evolution of the particle distribution is given by the continuity equation ( sikora et al .",

    ", time has been replaced by the distance travelled : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the time measured in the comoving frame ( tavecchio and ghisellini 2003 ) .",
    "the electrons lose energy through both adiabatic and radiative losses .",
    "ec / cmb is the dominant mechanism for radiative losses , and synchrotron cooling is negligible .",
    "this can be shown by comparing the magnetic and cm energy densities in the comoving frame of the jet : @xmath40 which can be inverted to write the cmb energy density in terms of an equivalent magnetic field : @xmath41    for typical parameters ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 is roughly 1 order of magnitude higher than the magnetic field inferred from fitting the synchrotron part of the sed .",
    "therefore , compton losses dominate over sychrotron ones .",
    "the timescales for radiative and adiabatic losses are given by : @xmath45 @xmath46 the matching point between the two regimes , where the electron population is expected to change slope , is found by comparing the two time scales : @xmath47 the break lorentz factor depends strongly on the source s bulk lorentz factor , assuming a typical expansion speed and size .",

    ", we take the injection term to be a power - law ( eq .",
    "[ steady2 ] ) , and then consider the effects of cooling on such a particle distribution . because the jet shows bright synchrotron emission , we assume for simplicty that the emission of knots is produced by a stationary state particle population .    due to the short radiative time scale ( eq .

    "we have shown that evolution of the particle energy distribution of the emitting electrons can have a key role in shaping the resulting synchrotron and ec / cmb components .",
    "in fact , the effects of cooling in the particle population can account for both the diffuse emission and the missing @xmath0ray issues that have been raised against the ec / cmb model .    as the sed of pks 0637752 shows , the flux of the external compton component in the _",
    "fermi_/lat is tightly constrained by available optical and ir data on the synchrotron peak , as both are generated by the same electrons .",
    "if as data suggests the particle population shows signs of cooling , then the total number of high energy electrons responsible for optical / ir and @xmath0ray emission is lower .",
    "this effect is most noticable around the peak synchrotron and inverse compton peaks , both of which are lower than in the case without cooling .    in light of this , we suggest that solid criteria to distinguish candidate @xmath0ray bright extended jets from fainter sources are a ) the jet knots display bright optical and ir emission in several bands b ) the overall spectrum of most knots is fairly hard in the optically thin radio and the x  ray bands ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "these criteria correspond to young sources in which radiative cooling is negligible ( a ) and for which the bulk of the x  ray emission can be produced by low energy electrons , which are expected to follow the same distribution as those emitting in the radio band ( b ) . out of every extended jet",
    "studied so far , the only source that matches these criteria is the jet of pks 1150 + 497 ( sambruna et al . 2006 ) .",
    "most of the other observed sources only have one or two measurements in the ir ",
    "uv bands , and therefore the peak synchrotron emission is not well constrained . as _",
    "fermi_/lat gathers more data , further observations with _",
    "hst _ and ( in the future ) with jwst will be crucial in identifying @xmath0ray bright candidates .",
    "multi  wavelength data on extended quasar knots are currently limited to relatively nearby jets ( @xmath81 ) selected through radio criteria ( sambruna et al .",
    "2004 , marshall et al .",
    "2005 , hogan et al .",
    "2011 ) . in this kind of sources",
    ", cooling is only important for the high energy end of the particle population , while the radio  synchrotron emission has not been suppressed by energy losses yet .",
    "this is consistent with the 40% optical detection rate of jets that are bright in both radio and x ",
    "rays ( sambruna et al . 2004 ) . in the context of ec / cmb models such radio  bright jets are therefore fairly young , and we would not expect relic knots ( i.e. with x  ray , but no radio emission ) to be commonly observed .",
    "indeed , only one jet ( 0827 + 243 , jorstad and marscher 2004 ) displays x  ray bright , radio  silent knots . due to all these considerations ,",
    "we propose that the diffuse emission problem can be entirely due to selection effects in the surveys conducted thus far .",
    "the main result of this paper is the prediction of the existence of a new class of radio  silent extended quasar jets that have been missed in observations conducted thus far due to selection bias .",
    "the prototype of such a source is the jet of b3 0727 + 490 , whose emission can be satisfactorily reproduced by computing electron cooling in an ec / cmb model . due to the strength of radiative cooling ,",
    "radio - silent jets are expected to be very common and easily detectable with _",
    "chandra _ , particularly at intermediate redshifts .",
    "such a prediction greatly differs from the expectations of alternative models that invoke synchrotron as the dominant mechanism for x  ray emission in extended quasar jets . because of radiative cooling , the extremely high energy electrons responsible for synchrotron x ",
    "rays should cool on timescales much shorter than those producing radio emission : therefore , far away ( @xmath82 ) jets are expected to either be completely undetectable at all frequencies ( if they are old sources ) , or at most bright in radio but faint in x  rays ( if the emitting particle population is younger ) . such radically different behaviors offer a very strong diagnostic to distinguish between the radiative models proposed so far , which are all capable of reproducing the seds of nearby , radio  bright jets .",
    "in this paper we have briefly reviewed the state of the standard model for the broad band emission of powerful , extended jets in beamed sources ( flat spectrum radio quasars ) , which invokes inverse compton scattering with cmb photons in order to reproduce the observed x  ray fluxes .",
    "the two main issues raised with the standard model are the lack of @xmath0ray detections by the _ fermi_/lat telescope ( which we call the missing @xmath0ray problem ) , and the apparent similar size of the emitting regions in the radio , x  ray and optical bands ( the diffuse emission problem ) .",
    "we find that the proposed solution of tavecchio and ghisellini ( 2003 ) to the diffuse emission problem leads to unphysical powers for the jet knots , and is therefore an unlikely scenario .    in order to account for both issues we proposed an extension of the standard ec / cmb model , in which the particle population responsible for the observed emission is computed self  consistently through the continuity equation in order to correctly account for radiative and adiabatic cooling .",
    "we find that our approach can both solve the missing @xmath0ray issue for the benchmark extended jet in the fsrq pks 0637752 , and can reproduce the sed of the peculiar radio - silent jet of the intermediate redshift ( @xmath8 ) fsrq b3 0727 + 490 .",
    "furthermore , we propose that the diffuse emission problem is a product of selection bias favouring younger sources .",
    "our updated model also produces a very strong testable prediction on a new class of sources , which have been missed in surveys conducted thus far .",
    "due to the effects of radiative cooling we expect a large amount of extended radio  silent jets that display significant amounts of x  ray emission , particularly at intermediate and high redshifts thanks to the increased cmb energy density and k  correction effects .",
    "popular alternative models to ec / cmb can very easily reproduce the observed seds of nearby ( @xmath83 ) sources , but they predict an opposite trend of very limited x  ray luminosity at higher redshift .",
    "therefore , particle cooling leads to a very powerful diagnostic for broad band radiative models in these sources .",
