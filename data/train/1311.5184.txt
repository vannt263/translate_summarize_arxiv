    "cognitive radio ( cr ) is a promising wireless technology to resolve the growing scarcity of the indispensable electromagnetic spectrum resources . by use of cr , secondary users ( sus ) without explicitly assigned spectrum resources can co - exist with primary users ( pus ) licensed with particular spectrum . in practice , some major communications regulators like the federal communications committee ( fcc ) in u.s . and the office of communications ( ofcom ) in u.k .",
    "have allowed secondary access for unlicensed devices to the terrestrial tv broadcast bands . among various forms of cr implementation ,",
    "spectrum - sharing cr is especially appealing for practical deployment since it does not involve complex spectrum - sensing mechanisms .",
    "more specifically , spectrum - sharing cr limits only the transmit power of sus such that their harmful interference onto pus remains below prescribed tolerable levels @xcite .",
    "because of the interference power constraint dictated by pus , the transmit power of sus in spectrum - sharing systems has to be very low , which limits the coverage area of secondary transmission . in order to extend the coverage area of secondary transmission and guarantee reliable communication ,",
    "cooperative relaying techniques can be exploited . using relaying techniques , a single or multiple idle users ( either pus or sus )",
    "can be involved in forwarding messages between a secondary source and its destination .",
    "the relaying can be implemented using two main techniques , amplify - and - forward ( af ) and decode - and - forward ( df ) .",
    "in particular , assuming df protocol and simple dual - hop transmission , system performance of dual - hop relaying in spectrum - sharing systems was extensively studied , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . nevertheless , apart from its implementation simplicity , the af relaying can outperform the df protocol when a relay is closer to its receiver @xcite . until lately , dual - hop af relaying was integrated into spectrum - sharing systems and its performance",
    "was explored @xcite .    in order to further extend the coverage area of the secondary transmitters",
    "yet reduce their interference region and its negative impact on pus , multi - hop af relaying can be implemented in real - world spectrum - sharing systems . for an efficient implementation of such techniques , performance evaluation and design",
    "are necessary .",
    "however , when analyzing system performance of multi - hop relaying , the simplistic dual - hop model does not capture many important features of multi - hop systems .",
    "for example , from the viewpoint of sus , system performance of multi - hop relaying will be inevitably affected by the interference - power constraint dictated by pus , which should be guaranteed by all intermediate nodes between a secondary source and its final destination . in order to mitigate this constraint ,",
    "dynamic power allocation at the secondary transmitters is necessary , but how about the effect of power allocation on the end - to - end performance of secondary multi - hop link ?",
    "in particular , compared to the simple dual - hop case , how will the increasing number of relaying hops affect system performance ?",
    "these issues are critical for an efficient implementation and deployment of multi - hop relaying in spectrum - sharing systems and will be explicitly addressed in this paper .",
    "accurate performance analysis of spectrum - sharing multi - hop af relaying is hardly tractable in closed - form due to extremely high mathematical difficulty . actually , even for the conventional multi - hop af relaying without spectrum sharing , closed - form performance analysis is still an open problem . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the lower and upper bounds on the end - to - end signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of spectrum - sharing multi - hop af relaying systems . in order to gain illuminating insights into system performance",
    ", we exploit extreme value theory and study limiting distribution functions of the said bounds , which are further applied to analyze the performance in terms of the outage probability , the diversity gain , the coding gain , and the achievable data rate .",
    "in particular , our results disclose that the diversity gain of the system under study is always unity , irrespective of the number of relaying hops . on the other hand ,",
    "the coding gain is proportional to the water level of the optimal water - filling power allocation at each secondary transmitter along the multi - hop link and to the large - scale path - loss ratio of the desired link to the interference link at each hop , yet is inversely proportional to the accumulated noise at the destination , namely , the product of the number of relays and noise variance .    in detailing the above highlighted contributions",
    ", the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ section : systemmodel ] describes the system model .",
    "section  [ section : powerallocation ] is devoted to the optimal transmit power allocation .",
    "subsequently , in section  [ section : e2esnr ] , the exact distribution functions of the end - to - end snr are derived and , for further processing , the limiting distribution functions of the lower and upper bounds on the end - to - end snr follow . with the resultant distribution functions ,",
    "the system performance is extensively analyzed and discussed in section  [ section : performanceanalysis ] .",
    "concluding remarks are provided in section  [ section : conclusion ] and , finally , some mathematical tools and detailed derivations are relegated to appendices .",

    "it is assumed that all nodes are equipped with a single half - duplex omnidirectional antenna each . in order to share the spectrum resources originally licensed to pus",
    ", the transmit power of sus is strictly limited by the prescribed tolerable interference power at the primary receiver .",
    "more details on the optimal power allocation at the secondary nodes along the multi - hop relaying link will be given in the next section .",
    "for the secondary multi - hop af relaying link , all sus work in a time - division multiple access ( tdma ) fashion and equal time slots of a transmission frame are allocated to each su along the multi - hop path .",

    "moreover , it is seen from - that the actual power values will greatly affect the end - to - end snr at the destination node @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , in the next section we establish the optimal transmit power at @xmath26 .    * remark 1 ( relay gain ) : * for a multi - hop relaying system , if the relay gain is set to the inverse of the channel gain of the previous hop , eq . is the exact expression of the end - to - end snr ( cf .",

    "acts an upper bound on the end - to - end snr .",
    "the former enables mathematical tractability and serves as a benchmark for all practical multi - hop af relaying schemes .",
    "in particular , a comparison of the outage probability between multi - hop systems with these two different relay gains demonstrated only a slight performance difference even in the low and medium snr regions ( cf .",
    "* remark 2 ( the interference coming from the primary transmitter ) : * for ease of mathematical tractability , the interference coming from the primary transmitter is not separately counted but treated as noise , as shown in eq . .",
    "this is feasible if the interference is weak , for example , when the primary transmitter is located far from the secondary users as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.systemmodel ] @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the interference can be treated as noise if the primary transmitter s signal is generated by random gaussian codebooks @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the validity of the methodology treating non - gaussian interference as noise was originally proven in @xcite . for an elaborate investigation into the effect of the interference on the end - to - end performance of dual - hop relaying",
    ", we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "in this section , the criterion for power allocation at the secondary nodes along the multi - hop relaying link ( including the source @xmath1 and its consecutive relaying nodes @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath28 ) is firstly established .",
    "then , based on this criterion , the value of the optimal transmit power during each transmission slot at each secondary node is determined .      in this part , the criterion for optimal power allocation at the secondary nodes @xmath14 , @xmath29 , is established .",
    "assume that the average tolerable interference power at the primary receiver is @xmath30 db with respect to the noise power .",
    "also , the distances corresponding to the desired link and the interference link at each hop are assumed to remain fixed during a communication between the secondary source and its destination ( cf .",
    "[ fig.systemmodel ] ) .",
    "thus , to maximize the achievable data rate at the @xmath9 hop , we need to optimize the transmit power at @xmath14 with respect to @xmath30 and the instantaneous fast - fading fluctuations of the corresponding desired channel and interference channel . to this end , it is easy to show that the first - order derivative of the end - to - end received snr @xmath31 given by with respect to @xmath8 is strictly positive and , hence , @xmath31 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , in order to maximize the achievable data rate @xmath32 at the @xmath9 hop , the optimal transmit power @xmath19 at @xmath14 is determined as the solution to the optimization problem : @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the distance and the channel fast - fading coefficient of the interference link from @xmath14 to @xmath5 , and the operator @xmath37 means statistical expectation . clearly , the optimal transmit power @xmath19 at secondary node @xmath14 is a function of the parameters of the desired link and the interference link ( i.e. @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.systemmodel ] ) , the noise variance ( @xmath20 ) , and the average tolerable interference power at the primary receiver ( @xmath30 ) .    in spectrum - sharing systems ,",
    "the tolerable interference power at the primary receivers can be generally defined by means of average interference power , peak interference power , or both @xcite .",
    "also , the maximum output - power for sus is constrained in practice .",
    "however , the effect of the maximum output - power constraint on system performance is essentially equivalent to the peak interference - power constraint , except for a scaling factor given by the interference channel gain .",
    "furthermore , it is already demonstrated that `` imposing a constraint on the peak interference power does not yield a significant impact on the ergodic capacity as long as the average interference power is constrained '' @xcite . as a result ,",
    "only the average interference - power constraint is considered in the optimization problem above .    applying the well - known lagrangian multiplier method ( * ? ? ?",

    "remarkably , this power allocation parameter has a significant effect on the system performance , as will be discussed further in the following section  [ subsection : diversitycodinggains ] . on the other hand , the ceiling operator @xmath41^+$ ] in implies that the transmit power is zero if the gain of the desired channel is smaller than a lower bound , i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "in such a case , no data will be transmitted . in other words , only when @xmath49 can @xmath14 transmit to its next node @xmath15 .",
    "this makes the spectrum - sharing multi - hop relaying system more energy efficient than the conventional multi - hop relaying system where the transmission between two consecutive nodes is totally regardless of the channel fluctuations in between .",
    "* remark 3 ( channel estimation ) : * it is noteworthy that , according to , when performing the optimal water - filling power allocation at secondary node @xmath14 , the channel parameters of the desired link @xmath22 and the interference link @xmath23 have to be efficiently estimated . among them , the parameters @xmath22 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be readily obtained by using the conventional training - sequence based methodology . on the other hand ,",
    "the parameters @xmath23 between @xmath14 and primary user @xmath24 can be attained at @xmath14 , for example , by periodically sensing the pilot signals transmitted by @xmath24 under the assumption of channel reciprocity @xcite , or by indirect feedback from a third - party such as a band manager which coordinates between the primary and secondary users @xcite .",
    "although the acquisition of this channel state information ( csi ) requires additional cost at sus , it enables them to strictly comply with the prescribed interference power constraint at pus and to maximize the achievable data rate at each hop .",
    "also , we note that in practice , there must be errors when estimating the csi",
    ". a further inspection of this issue is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "* remark 4 ( on the optimality of power allocation ) : * for the cognitive multi - hop relaying under study , all sus along the multi - hop link work in a tdma fashion and there is no central node .",
    "thus , it is impossible to collect all csi before performing optimal power - allocation among all sus along the multi - hop path .",
    "actually , for the node @xmath26 along the path , it has only the csi pertaining to the desired link @xmath50 and the interference link @xmath51 .",
    "accordingly , the optimal power allocation can only be performed with respect to these csi . in other words ,",
    "the optimal power allocation can only be performed within a single hop instead of the end - to - end link .",
    "this optimization strategy is essentially to `` make best efforts '' at each relaying hop .      according to , in order to determine the power allocation parameter @xmath42",
    ", we derive the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath53 . since all channels in the system under study are supposed to be subject to rayleigh fading with unit - mean , it is straightforward that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are exponentially distributed with unit - mean .",

    "next , we investigate the distribution functions and moment generation function ( mgf ) of the end - to - end snr at the secondary destination .",

    "here , we derive the exact distribution functions and mgf of the end - to - end snr at the secondary destination . by virtue of the end - to - end snr expression shown in , in order to determine its distribution functions , we need to firstly derive the distribution functions of its component @xmath8 given by . more specifically , substituting the obtained optimal transmit power @xmath19 shown in into the expression ,",
