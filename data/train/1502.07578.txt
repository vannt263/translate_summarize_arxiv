    "sec.ii is related to the general equation of the model .",
    "the friedmann equations and conservation equation are expressed in this section .",
    "then , in two subsections , the hamilton - jacobi and attractive behavior of the model are discussed . in sec.iii , for more specific results , two typical functions are introduced for the hubble parameter in two separate subsection , as power - law and exponential function , and the observational constraints on the model are explained .",
    "the results of the work are summarized in sec.iv .",
    "in born - infeld form , the effective action for tachyon could be described by @xcite @xmath0 in which @xmath1 is the ricci scalar , derived from metric @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the tachyon scalar field with minimal coupling to gravity .",
    "the potential of the scalar field is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "also , @xmath5 is the planck mass . in this work",
    ", we are going to consider the universe evolution at one of the earliest times , namely , inflation . in this period of time",
    ", it is assumed that the scalar field dominates the universe and derives inflation . + taking a variation of action with respect to two independent variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 leads to two main dynamical equations .",
    "based on recent observational data , the universe is isotropic , homogeneous , and spatially flat .",
    "the common metric to describing such a geometry is the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric , which is read as @xmath6 the energy - momentum tensor for such a spatially flat flrw universe is described by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are tachyon energy density and pressure , respectively and given by @xmath10 the friedmann equation keeps its usual form as @xmath11 and the acceleration could be derived easily from eq.([04 ] ) as @xmath12 the universe stays in the accelerated expansion phase as long as @xmath13 .",
    "this condition is different from its corresponding condition in standard inflation where @xmath14 because there is no mention of a potential @xcite .",
    "+ the equation of motion of the tachyon scalar field comes from eq.([01 ] ) as @xmath15 which could be rewritten as a familiar form of the conservation equation @xmath16 .",
    "the tachyon inflation should begin with a very small value of @xmath17 , namely , @xmath18 , to get enough inflation .",
    "+ there are two known approaches for studying the inflation scenario .",
    "the first approach is `` slow - rolling , '' which has been widely used . in this formalism",
    ", it is assumed that the potential of the scalar field dominated over the kinetic term , and the scalar field slowly rolls down to the minimum of its potential .",
    "the slow - rolling approximation comes to an almost flat potential during inflation , which leads to enough expansion to solve standard cosmology problems .",
    "moreover , it is necessary to introduce a form of the potential to arrive at the final results of the model .",
    "the second approach is known as hamilton - jacobi . instead of a potential",
    ", we need only to introduce a function of the scalar field for hubble parameter @xmath19 .",
    "then , one can derive almost the whole of the parameters of the model . in the present work ,",
    "the hamilton - jacobi approach is picked out for considering the universe evolution in the inflationary epoch .",
    "+      the hubble parameter is supposed as a function of the scalar field , namely , @xmath19 . then , the time variable of @xmath20 could be rewritten as @xmath21 , where the prime denotes derivative with respect to the scalar field . by using eqs.([03 ] ) and",
    "( [ 04 ] ) , the time derivative of the scalar field could be obtained in terms of scalar field as follows @xmath22 it is clear that , if @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , the scalar field increases ( decreases ) by passing time , namely , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "+ using eq.([07 ] ) and friedmann equations ( [ 04 ] ) , one can obtain @xmath27^{2}-{9 \\over 4}h^{4}(\\phi)+({4 \\pi \\over m^{2}_{p}})^{2}v^{2}(\\phi)=0.\\ ] ] equation ( [ 07a ] ) is the hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "the potential of the model is easily obtained as a function of the scalar field from eq .",
    "( [ 07a ] ) as @xmath28 as the tachyon field grows up , its potential tends to zero [ @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; , however , the exact form of the potential is unknown yet @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the exponential potential could explain the qualitative dynamics of string theory of the tachyon @xcite .",
    "later , it was suggested that a desirable cosmology could be constructed by a runaway potential with the tachyonic equation of state @xcite . + to avoid an imaginary potential , the term @xmath31 must always be smaller than unity .",
    "therefore , it comes to a condition as @xmath32 , which must be satisfied . +",
    "in comparison to ordinary single scalar field inflation , the slow - roll parameters are defined by @xcite @xmath33 it is assumed that during inflation the universe undergoes a quasi - de sitter expansion , in which the slow - roll parameters are much smaller than unity : @xmath34 ( known as the slow - roll approximation ) .",
    "inflation ends when @xmath35 vanishes or , equivalently , when the slow - roll parameter @xmath36 arrives at unity .",
    "hence , at the end of inflation , we have @xmath37 therefore , the scalar field at the end of inflation could easily be read .",
    "another important parameter is the scale factor of the universe , which is denoted by @xmath38 . by using eq.([07 ] ) and",
    "relation @xmath39 , the scale factor is expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the constant of integration . the number of _ e_-folds , which describe the amount of expansion , is described as @xmath42 in which the subscript `` _ _ e _ _ '' and `` _ _ i _ _ , '' respectively , denote the end and beginning of inflation .",
    "it seems that , in the hamilton - jacobi approach , the main parameters of model could be derived more easily than the slow - rolling approach , with less assumptions . + during inflation , the scalar field and gravitons underwent quantum fluctuations .",
    "one of the most important advantages of inflation is that this theory not only can solve the problem of standard cosmology , it also is able to provide a mechanism to explain the observed anisotropy .",
    "the main fluctuation are known as scalar and tensor fluctuations , which are , respectively , known as curvature and gravitational perturbationa .",
    "these perturbation for tachyon inflation are derived by using a similar method as original scalar field inflation .",
    "the scalar perturbation for the tachyon scalar field gets a different equation because of its different coupling to geometry .",
    "however , the tensor perturbation part , which describes the propagation of gravitational waves , possesses the same equation as the original scalar field , since there it has no coupling to matter . both of these equations and their answers are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in more detail .      by using the hamilton - jacobi approach , it is easy to consider whether all possible trajectories ( or solutions ) converge to a common attractor solution .",
    "doing so , we are going to follow ref .",
    "@xcite and assume a homogeneous perturbation to a solution @xmath43 . if the homogenous perturbation part @xmath44 becomes small by passing time , it could be said that the attractor condition is satisfied .",
    "+ substituting @xmath45 into eq.([07a ] ) and linearizing , one arrives at @xmath46 the solution of the above differential equation is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the initial value of perturbation at @xmath49 .",
    "having @xmath50 , one could investigate the behavior of perturbation @xmath51 .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi approach makes it easy to consider attractive behavior of solutions .",
    "+ in the following section , a few typical examples are expressed for @xmath50 , and the consequences will be discussed in more detail .",
    "up to now , the general forms of parameters have been derived , and some crude results were obtained . in this section , in order to get more specific results , we are going to introduce two functions for the hubble parameter in terms of the scalar field , as a power - law function and an exponential function .",
    "+      as the first case , we assume the hubble parameter is a power - law function of scalar field @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are constant . by using eq.([07 ] ) , the scalar field could be expressed by @xmath55 therefore , it clearly could be seen that , the scalar field has a decreasing ( increasing ) behavior for @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) . regardless of the @xmath54 sign , the general form of potential could be derived from eq.([08 ] ) : @xmath58 the condition of having a real potential leads to the following expression : @xmath59 which should be satisfied during the inflation .",
    "it easily could be checked that the potential condition is satisfied for all values of @xmath54 except for @xmath60 , where one encounters an imaginary potential .",

    "in contrast with parameter @xmath54 , the magnitude of the tensor spectral index increases by enhancement of @xmath73 and reduces by increasing @xmath72 .",
    "another perturbation is tensor perturbation , which is also known as gravitational waves .",
    "the produced tensor fluctuations induce a curled polarization in the cmb radiation and increase the overall amplitude of its anisotropies at a large scale .",
    "the physics of the early universe could be specified by fitting the analytical results of the cmb and density spectral to corresponding observational data . at first",
    ", it was thought that the possible effects of primordial gravitational waves are not important and might be ignored . however , a few years ago , it was found out that the tensor fluctuations have an important role and should be more attended for determining best - fit values of the cosmological parameters from cmb and lss spectra @xcite .",
    "the imprint of tensor fluctuation on the cmb brings this idea to indirectly determine its contribution to power spectra by measuring cmb polarization @xcite .",
    "such a contribution could be expressed by the @xmath75 quantity , which is known as the tensor - to - scalar ratio and represents the relative amplitude of the tensor to scalar fluctuation : @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , constraining @xmath75 is one of the main goals of a modern cmb survey . on the other hand , determining an exact value for @xmath75 , which represents the existence of gravitational waves , is very difficult .",
    "based on planck satellite data , we were able only to put an upper bound for @xmath75 as @xmath77 .",

    "this quantity is about @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the differential equation of the tensor perturbation for the tachyon scalar field is the same as the ordinary scalar field , because there is no coupling between the tensor perturbation and matter term .",
    "then one could arrive at the same results for the amplitude of the tensor perturbation as @xmath82 @xcite . by using this relation , and",
