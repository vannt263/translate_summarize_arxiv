    "moreover they showed that any vassiliev invariant of classical knots can be extended to virtual knots and calculated via gauss diagrams formulas .",
    "braids are a fundamental part of knot theory , as each link can be represented as the closure of a braid @xcite ( alexander s theorem ) and there is a complete characterization of the closure of braids given by markov s theorem @xcite .",
    "l. kauffman defined virtual braids and virtual string links and he also gave a virtual version of alexander s theorem @xcite .",
    "independendtly s. kamada also proved a virtual version of alexander s theorem and a full characterization of the closure of virtual braids , i.e. a virtual version of markov s theorem @xcite .",
    "goussarov , polyak and viro defined gauss diagrams for virtual string links .",
    "all though they stated that , up to virtual and mixed moves , each gauss diagram defines a unique virtual string link diagram @xcite , it is not clear that this statement is still true for virtual braids .    in section 2",
    "we describe the braid version of gauss diagrams and then we prove that each braid - gauss diagram defines , up to virtual and mixed moves , a unique virtual braid diagram .",
    "then we introduce the @xmath1 moves in braid - gauss diagrams and we show that there is a bijection a bijection between the @xmath1 equivalence classes of braid - gauss diagrams and the virtual braids .",

    "this result is quite technical and it has been considered as folklore in literature , even though it was missing a rigorous proof .",
    "gauss diagrams allow us to manage global information with much more liberty as they express the interaction among all strands along the time . on the other hand , on gauss digrams we can obvious the virtual crossings , as the valuable information of virtual objects underlies on how the strands interacts with themselves through regular crossings , this information is expressed on the arrows of the gauss diagrams . in particular",

    "they proved that abstract links are in bijective correspondence with virtual links .    a representation of a virtual knot in a closed surface",
    "is called a _ realization _ of the virtual knot .",
    "the stable equivalence identifies different realizations , which means that a virtual knot may be realized in different surfaces .",
    "g. kuperberg proved that any virtual link admits a realization in a surface of minimal genus and , up to diffeomorphism and reidemeister moves , this realization is unique @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we provide a topological interpretation of virtual braids inspired by @xcite . in section 3",
    "we introduce the notion of abstract braid diagrams , that are braid diagrams in a surface with two distinguished boundary components and a real smooth function satisfying some conditions .",
    "we also introduce the stable equivalence of abstract braid diagrams .",
    "the _ abstract braids _ are the abstract braid diagrams identified up to compatibility , stable equivalence and reidemeister moves . we prove that abstract braids are in bijective correspondence with virtual braids .    the notion of abstract braid diagram must not be confused with the definition given in @xcite , even if the concept is quite similar .",
    "an abstract diagram in @xcite is a pair @xmath2 , with @xmath3 an oriented , compact surface and @xmath4 is a diagram in @xmath3 such that @xmath4 is a deformation retract of @xmath3 . in any case , what we define as abstract braid diagram corresponds to the realization of an abstract diagram in @xcite .    in section 4 ( theorem [ thm:3 ] ) we prove that given an abstract braid , there is a unique abstract braid diagram ( up to reidemeister moves and compatibility ) of minimal genus .",
