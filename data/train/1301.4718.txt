    "recently , the investigation of spin - orbit ( so ) coupling in neutral atoms has attracted much attentions @xcite . in particular , a one - dimensional ( 1d ) equal rashba and dresselhaus so coupling has been first realized in the ultracold @xmath0rb atoms by a couple of raman lasers @xcite . by applying the same laser technique , this 1d so",
    "coupling has been also achieved experimentally in the degenerate fermi gas with @xmath1k @xcite and @xmath2li @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations have been revealed that in the presence of so coupling , the degenerate fermi gas can exhibit the interesting physics in both three jpv , gm , yzq , hh , jpv1,iskin , lj , wy1,ld , li , ks , kz , rl , zhangp1,peng1,hly1,ld1 and lower dimensions @xcite .",
    "for example , by increasing the strength of so coupling , the density of state at the fermi surface is increased , and the cooper paring gap can be thus enhanced significantly @xcite .",
    "more importantly , this system may be changed from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid to the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) with a new two - body bound state called rashbon @xcite . when an effective zeeman field is applied , the 2d degenerate fermi gas with the rashba so coupling exhibits an exotic topological superfluid supporting the majorana fermions @xcite , which is the heart for realizing the topological quantum computing @xcite .",
    "recently , a universal midgap bound state in the topological superfluid has been predicted @xcite .    to illustrate the so - driven fundamental physics ,",
    "a generalized one - channel model has been introduced in all previous considerations jpv , gm , yzq , hh , jpv1,iskin , lj , wy1,ld , li , ks , kz , rl , zhangp1,peng1,hly1,ld1,chen , mg , hly2,jz , wy2,xyang , zjn , fw . in this one - channel model ,",
    "only the atoms tuned via the feshbash - resonant technique are taken into account .",
    "however , it is valid for the _ broad _ feshbash - resonant regime with @xmath3 @xcite , where the dimensionless parameter is defined as @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the bohr magneton , @xmath6 is the atom mass , @xmath7 is the background @xmath8-wave scattering strength , @xmath9 is the resonant width and @xmath10 is the fermi energy .",
    "in fact , to get a more realistic and complete description of the degenerate fermi gas , especially in the _ narrow _ feshbash - resonant limit with @xmath11 , we must introduce a two - channel model @xcite , which includes both the atoms in the open channel and the molecules in the closed channel .",
    "moreover , in the narrow feshbash - resonant regime , some fundamental properties can be observed experimentally by detecting the striking molecular signature @xcite , additional to measuring the superfluid pairing gap applied usually in the one - channel model @xcite .",
    "more importantly , new quantum phase transitions have been predicted yn , zs , attributed to the existence of extra u(1 ) symmetry for the molecular field . on the experimental side ,",
    "the degenerate fermi gas in the narrow feshbach - resonant regime has been also reported successfully in @xmath2li @xcite and the fermi - fermi mixture of @xmath2li and @xmath1k @xcite .",
    "thus , it is crucially important to explore the so - induced exotic physics in this regime @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the so - induced bound state and molecular signature of the degenerate fermi gas in the narrow feshbach resonance .",
    "the main results are given as follows .",
    "( i ) without the atom - atom interactions , only one bound state can be found even if so coupling exists .",
    "moreover , the corresponding bound - state energy depends strongly on the strength of so coupling , but is influenced slightly on its type .",
    "( ii ) with the increasing of the strength of so coupling , the critical point at which the molecular fraction vanishes shifts from zero to the negative detuning . in the weak so coupling ,",
    "this shifting is proportional to the square of its strength .",
    "( iii ) finally , we also show that the molecular fraction can be well controlled by so coupling .",
    "we believe that in experiments it is a good signature to detect the so - induced physics .",
    "for the so - driven two - channel model , the total hamiltonian can be written formally as @xmath12 in hamiltonian ( [ total h ] ) , @xmath13is the atom hamiltonian , where @xmath14 is the creation operator for a atom with the momentum @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and @xmath17 * *  * * is the kinetic energy of the atom . @xmath18is",
    "the molecular hamiltonian , where @xmath19 is the creation operator of a molecule with the momentum @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath22 is the kinetic energy of the molecule , and @xmath23 is the bare detuning determined by the feshbash - resonant position @xmath24 via a relation @xmath25without so coupling , the system has the bcs superfluid in the positive detuning ( @xmath26 ) , and enters into the bec regime in the negative * *  * * detuning ( @xmath27 ) * *  * * @xcite*. * at lower energy , the position is given approximately by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the magnetic field at which the resonance is at zero energy , and @xmath30 is the tunable magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the atom - molecule interconversion term is governed by the following hamiltonian @xmath31where @xmath32 is the coupling constant that measures the amplitude of the decay of the molecule in the closed channel into a pair of the open - channel atoms . * *  * * finally , the so coupling is chosen as a generalized rashba and dresselhaus type .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is given by @xmath33   \\label{hs}\\]]with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the so coupling strengths for the rashba and dresselhaus types , respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath38 is the generalized strength of so coupling and the dimensionless parameter @xmath39reflects the competition between these different types of so coupling .",
    "for example , for @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , the 2d rashba so coupling can be found . whereas , for @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , the 1d equal rashba and dresselhaus so coupling can be generated .",
    "fortunately , this 1d so coupling has been realized experimentally in the ultracold neutral atoms @xcite .    in the absence of so coupling ,",
    "the limit @xmath44 can be applied usually to discuss the standard two - channel model including the effective zeeman field @xcite . however , in the presence of so coupling , the result is quite complicated .",
    "if both so coupling and the effective zeeman field are taken into account , the parity and time - reversal symmetries are broken . as a result , the @xmath20-dependent order parameter should be introduced dfa . however , in this paper we do not consider the effect of the effective zeeman field and thus may focus on the case of @xmath44 .",
    "we begin to discuss the two - body bound state of the generalized two - channel model ( [ total h ] ) by introducing the ansatz wavefunction . in the absence of so coupling ( @xmath45 ) ,",
    "hamiltonian ( [ total h ] ) reduces to the standard two - channel model @xmath46 @xcite , in which only the singlet cooper paring can be formed .",
    "however , in the presence of so coupling , both the singlet and triplet cooper parings can coexist @xcite . as a result",
    ", the ansatz wavefunction should be written formally as @xmath47where @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) represent the probability amplitude of the singlet ( triplet ) cooper paring , @xmath52 stands for the probability amplitude of the molecule , and @xmath53 is the direct multiple of the fermion vacuum with spin flipping and the molecule vacuum . substituting the wavefunction in eq .",
    "( [ ws ] ) into the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath54we find that the six coefficients determining the ansatz wavefunction @xmath55 and the energy @xmath56 are governed by the following equations : @xmath57where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "( [ eqc ] ) can not be solved directly because of lack of a coefficient equation . if we define the spin symmetry and anti - symmetry vectors as @xmath60the stationary schrdinger equation is rewritten as @xmath61 in the representation of @xmath62^{t}$ ] .",
    "this leads to another equations for the coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 , that is , @xmath65substituting eq .",

    "1(a ) , the red open symbol corresponds to the analytical result ( ar ) and the black solid line represents the direct numerical simulation ( ns).,width=283 ]    equation ( [ meq ] ) , which is the main result of this paper , determines the so - induced bound - state energy of the generalized two - channel model ( total h ) .",
    "the procedure is given as follows .",
    "( i ) we first obtain the energy @xmath56 from eq .",
    "( [ meq ] ) .",
    "( ii ) then , we introduce the threshold energy @xmath72 , which is the lowest energy of the free particle ( i.e. , the lowest band ) , to judge whether this energy is the bound - state energy or not . if @xmath73 , the bound state exists and the corresponding energy @xmath56 is called the bound - state energy , and vice versa @xcite . according to its definition ,",
    "the threshold energy @xmath72 of the generalized two - channel model ( [ total h ] ) is evaluated as @xmath74 in the absence of so coupling ( @xmath45 ) , this threshold energy becomes @xmath75 , as expected . in the following discussions , we mainly consider two interesting cases , including the 2d rashba so coupling ( @xmath40 ) and 1d equal rashba and dresselhaus so coupling ( @xmath42 ) , to reveal the fundamental properties of the bound state .",
    "we first address the case of the 2d rashba so coupling ( @xmath40 ) . in the absence of so coupling ( @xmath45 ) ,",
    "the analytical bound - state energy is derived from eq .",
    "( [ meq ] ) by @xmath76it implies that in such a case only one bound state can be found @xcite . in the presence of so coupling ( @xmath77 ) , the explicit expression for the bound - state energy",
    "can not be obtained . however , for the weak so coupling , eq .",
    "( [ meq ] ) is simplified as @xmath78}{8\\pi \\hbar ^{5}\\sqrt{-e}}=\\frac{e-\\delta } { g^{2 } }   \\label{eeq}\\]]with the help of a taylor expansion with respect to the strength of so coupling . in this case , hamiltonian ( [ total h ] ) also exhibits one bound state , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . by further solving eq .",
    "( [ eeq ] ) approximately , we find that the bound - state energy is proportional to @xmath79",
    ". this behavior agrees well with the numerical simulation , as also shown in fig .",
    "it implies that the bound - state energy can decrease by increasing the strength of so coupling . for the strong so coupling",
    ", the perturbation method is invalid .",
    "here we numerically solve eq .",
    "( [ meq ] ) to evaluate the bound - state energy @xmath56 .",
    "even if the strong so coupling exists , only one bound state can be found , as shown in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c )     for the different types of so coupling including @xmath80 ( the 2d rashba so coupling ) and @xmath81 ( the 1d equal rashba and dresselhaus so coupling ) when @xmath71 and @xmath82.,width=279 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the bound - state energy with respect to the detuning @xmath24 for the different types of so coupling including @xmath83 ( the 2d rashba so coupling ) and @xmath42 ( the 1d equal rashba and dresselhaus so coupling ) . it can be seen clearly that the bound - state energy is affected slightly by the type of so coupling .",
    "when the feshbach - resonant width parameter @xmath84 increases , the system changes from the narrow limit ( @xmath11 ) to the broad limit ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "especially , for the broad limit ( @xmath3 ) , eq .",
    "( [ meq ] ) becomes @xmath86which is similar to the result of ref .",

    "this figure shows again that for the broad limit our considered two - channel model reduces to the single - channel model .",
    "however , it should be remarked that the energy @xmath56 for the broad feshbach resonance is not a bound - state energy , but is a two - body interaction energy approaching infinitely the bound - state energy @xcite     as a function of the detuning @xmath67 for the different feshbach - resonant widths ( a ) @xmath89 , ( b ) @xmath90 , and ( c ) @xmath88 when @xmath91 . in ( b ) and ( c ) , the red dash line corresponds to the numerical solution of eq .",

    ", the similar conclusion can be also found.,width=298 ]",
    "having obtained the bound - state energy in the generalized two - channel model , it is conveniently to discuss the experimentally - measurable molecular signature . in terms of the hellmann - feymann theorem ,",
