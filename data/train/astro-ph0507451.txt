    "the veritas collaboration is building an array of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes for ground - based gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "phase - i of the project consists of four , @xmath0 telescopes sited at horseshoe canyon on kitt peak , arizona , at an altitude of @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ tel1 ] shows the first of these telescopes temporarily installed at the base camp of the whipple observatory at mt .",
    "hopkins ( altitude=@xmath2 ) .",
    "the veritas telescopes follow a davies - cotton optical design with @xmath0 aperture and @xmath0 focal length .",
    "the mechanical structure consists of an altitude - azimuth mount and a steel optical support structure ( oss ) .",
    "the mount is a commercial unit manufactured by rpm - psi ( northridge , california ) ; the oss is custom designed by m3 engineering ( tucson , arizona ) and fabricated by amber steel ( chandler , arizona ) @xcite .",
    "the tracking is measured to be accurate to @xmath3 with a maximum slew speed of @xmath4 .",
    "tests with a slightly modified drive system have enabled us to reach maximum slew speeds of @xmath5 ; the remaining telescopes will have this modification installed as standard .",
    "the 350 individual mirror facets are hexagonal , each with an area of @xmath6 , providing a total mirror area of @xmath7 .",
    "they are made from glass , slumped and polished and then coated with aluminium and anodized at a dedicated facility on - site .",
    "reflectivity is @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "each facet is shaped with a @xmath10 radius of curvature and arranged on a spherical surface of @xmath0 radius . throughout most of the observations presented in this paper ,",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) at the position of polaris was measured to be @xmath11 fwhm .",
    "recently , the telescope alignment has been optimized , and the current psf is @xmath12 .",
    "a prototype version of the telescope started operations in early 2004 , and the completed telescope has been operating since january 2005 .",
    "the structure is robust and the positioning precision very reliable .",
    "we envisage no problems or major changes to the design for the remaining veritas telescopes .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     an observing campaign , complementary to that of the whipple 10  m continued until june 2005 , resulting in @xmath13 detections of the known gamma - ray sources mkn  421 and mkn  501 @xcite and data sets on various potential tev sources .",
    "a full online analysis package enables us to detect strong flaring behaviour within minutes .",
    "the first veritas telescope has been operating throughout 2005 , has met all technical specifications and detected a number of tev gamma - ray sources .",
    "the kitt peak site for veritas phase - i has undergone significant development ; site clearance , power line installation and construction of all four telescope pads has been completed .",
    "the major mechanical components of all four telescopes have been delivered to the mt hopkins base camp .",
    "because of a temporary delay in access to the kitt peak site , we have decided to install the second veritas telescope at the whipple base camp , @xmath14 away from the first telescope on an east - west baseline . by operating these two telescopes together beginning autumn 2005",
    ", we will be able to reject the muon background and dramatically increase sensitivity , as well as test the array trigger electronics ."
