    "a recent influx of academic monographs @xcite and popular books @xcite manifests a keen cultural and scientific interest in complex networks , which appeal to both applied and theoretical problems in national defense , sociology , epidemiology , computer science , statistics , and mathematics .",
    "the erds  rnyi random graph @xcite remains the most widely studied network model .",
    "its simple dynamics endow it with remarkable mathematical properties , but this simplicity overpowers any ability to replicate realistic structure .",
    "many other network models have been inspired by empirical observations .",
    "chief among these is the _ scale - free _ phenomenon , which has garnered attention since the initial observation of power law behavior for internet statistics @xcite .",
    "celebrated is barabsi and albert s preferential attachment model @xcite , whose dynamics are tied to the _ rich get richer _ or _ matthew effect_. citing overlooked attributes of network sampling schemes , other authors @xcite have questioned the power law s apparent ubiquity .",
    "otherwise , watts and strogatz @xcite proposed a model that replicates milgram s _ small - world _",
    "phenomenon @xcite , the vernacular notion of _ six degrees of separation _ in social networks .",
    "networks arising in many practical settings are dynamic , they change with time .",
    "consider a population @xmath0 of individuals . for each @xmath1",
    ", let @xmath2 indicate a social relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath4 and let @xmath5 comprise the indicators for the whole population at time @xmath6 .",
    "for example , @xmath2 can indicate whether @xmath3 and @xmath4 are co - workers , friends , or family , have communicated by phone , email , or telegraph within the last week , month , or year , or subscribe to the same religious , political , or philosophical ideology . within the narrow scope of social networks ,",
    "the potential meanings of @xmath2 seem endless ; expanding to other disciplines , the possible interpretations grow . in sociology ,",
    "@xmath7 records changes of social relationships in a population ; in other fields , the network dynamics reflect different phenomena and , therefore , can exhibit vastly different behaviors . in each case , @xmath7 is a time - varying network .",
    "time - varying network models have been proposed previously in the applied statistics literature .",
    "the _ temporal exponential random graph model _ ( tergm ) in @xcite incorporates temporal dependence into the _ exponential random graph model _ ( ergm ) .",
    "the authors highlight select properties of the tergm , but consistency under subsampling is not among them . from the connection between sampling consistency and lack of interference",
    ", it is no surprise that the exponential random graph model is sampling consistent only under a choking restriction on its sufficient statistics @xcite .",
    "mccullagh @xcite argues unequivocally the importance of consistency for statistical models .",
    "presently , no network model both meets these logical requirements and reflects empirical observations . in this paper , rather than",
    "focus on a particular application , we discuss network modeling from first principles .",
    "we model time - varying networks by stochastic processes with a few natural invariance properties , specifically , exchangeable , consistent markov processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section : modeling preliminaries ] , we discuss first principles for modeling time - varying networks ; in section  [ section : informal description ] , we describe the rewiring process informally ; in section  [ section : rewiring maps ] , we introduce the workhorse of the paper , the rewiring maps ; in sections  [ section : discrete ] and [ section : exchangeable rewiring maps ] , we discuss a family of time - varying network models in discrete - time ; in section  [ section : continuous ] , we extend to continuous - time ; in section  [ section : poissonian structure ] , we show a poisson point process construction for the rewiring process , and we use this technique to establish the feller property ; and in section  [ section : concluding remarks ] , we make some concluding remarks .",
    "we prove some technical lemmas and theorems in section  [ section : proof ] .",
    "for now , we operate with the usual definition of a graph / network as a pair @xmath8 of vertices and edges . we delay formalities until they are needed .",
    "let @xmath9 be a random collection of graphs indexed by @xmath10 , denoting _ time_. we may think of @xmath11 as a collection of social networks ( for the same population ) that changes as a result of social forces , for example , geographical relocation , broken relationships , new relationships , etc . , but our discussion generalizes to other applications .    in practice , we can observe only a finite sample of individuals . since the population size is often unknown , we assume an infinite population so that our model only depends on known quantities .",
    "thus , each @xmath12 is a graph with infinitely many vertices , of which we observe a finite sub - network @xmath13}_t$ ] with @xmath14 vertices .",
    "since the vertex labels play no role , we always assume sampled graphs have vertex set @xmath15:=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] , where @xmath16 is the sample size , and the population graph is infinite with vertex set @xmath17 , the natural numbers .",
    "the models we consider are _ markovian _ , _ exchangeable _ , and _",
    "consistent_.      the process @xmath11 has the _ markov property _",
    "if , for every @xmath18 , its pre-@xmath6 and post-@xmath6 @xmath19-fields are conditionally independent given the present state @xmath12 .",
    "put another way , the current state @xmath12 incorporates all past and present information about the process , and so the future evolution depends on @xmath20 only through @xmath12 .",
    "it is easy to conceive of counterarguments to this assumption : in a social network , suppose there is no edge between individuals @xmath21 and @xmath22 or between @xmath23 and @xmath24 at time @xmath18 .",
    "then , informally , and @xmath25 for the sake of illustration . ]",
    "we expect the future ( marginal ) evolution of edges @xmath26 and @xmath25 to be identically distributed .",
    "but if , in the past , @xmath21 and @xmath22 have been frequently connected and @xmath23 and @xmath24 have not , we might infer that the latent relationships among these individuals are different and , thus , their corresponding edges should evolve differently .",
    "for instance , given their past behavior , we might expect that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are more likely than @xmath23 and @xmath24 to reconnect in the future .    despite such counterarguments ,",
    "the markov property is widely used and works well in practice .",
    "generalizations to the markov property may be appropriate for specific applications , but they run the risk of overfitting .      structure and changes to structure drive our study of networks .",
    "vertex labels carry no substantive meaning other than to keep track of this structure over time ; thus , a suitable model is _ exchangeable _ , that is , its distributions are invariant under relabeling of the vertices .    for a model on finite networks ( i.e. , finitely many vertices )",
    ", exchangeability can be induced trivially by averaging uniformly over all permutations of the vertices .",
    "but we assume an infinite population , for which the appropriate invariance is _ infinite exchangeability _ , the combination of exchangeability and consistency under subsampling ( section  [ section : consistency ] ) .",
    "unlike the finite setting , infinite exchangeability can not be imposed arbitrarily by averaging ; it must be an inherent feature of the model .      for any graph with vertex set @xmath27",
    ", there is a natural and obvious restriction to an induced subgraph with vertex set @xmath28 by removing all vertices and edges that are not fully contained in @xmath29 .",
    "the assumption of _ markovian consistency _ , or simply _ consistency _",
    ", for a graph - valued markov process implies that , for every @xmath30 , the restriction @xmath31}$ ] of @xmath11 to the space of graphs with vertex set @xmath15 $ ] is , itself , a markov process .",
    "note that this property does not follow immediately from the markov assumption for @xmath11 because the restriction operation is a many - to - one function and , in general , a function of a markov process need not be markov .",
    "also note that the behavior of the restriction @xmath31}$ ] can depend on @xmath11 through as much as its exchangeable @xmath32-field , which depends only on the `` tail '' of the process .",
    "markovian consistency may be unjustified in some network modeling applications .",
    "this contrasts with other combinatorial stochastic process models , for example , coalescent processes @xcite , for which consistency is induced by an inherent _ lack of interference _ in the underlying scientific phenomena .",
    "nevertheless , if we assume the network is a sample from a larger network , then consistency permits out - of - sample statistical inference @xcite . without markovian consistency in a time - varying markov model ,",
    "the sampled process can depend on the whole ( unobserved ) process , leaving little hope for meaningful inference .",
    "we can envision at least two kinds of network dynamics that correspond , intuitively , to _ local _ and _ global _ structural changes .",
    "local changes involve _ only one _ edge , global changes involve a _ positive fraction _ of edges .",
    "we say the _ status _ of edge @xmath33 is _ on _ if there is an edge between @xmath21 and @xmath23 ; otherwise , we say the status is _",
    "off_.    a local change occurs whenever the status of exactly one edge changes , called a _ single - edge update_. an easy way to generate single - edge updates is by superposition of independent rate-1 poisson processes . for each pair",
    "@xmath34 , we let @xmath35 be the arrival times of a rate-1 poisson point process . at each arrival time , the status of the edge between @xmath21 and @xmath23 changes ( either from ` off ' to ` on ' or the reverse ) . doing this independently for each pair results in an infinite number of changes to the network in any arbitrary time interval , but only finitely many changes within each finite subnetwork .",
    "we call a process with this description a _ local - edge process _ ; see section  [ section : local - edge ] .",
    "a global change occurs whenever the status of a positive proportion of edges changes simultaneously . in practice ,",
    "such an event might indicate a major external disturbance within the population , for example , spread or fear of a pandemic .",
    "modeling such processes in continuous - time requires more preparation than the local - edge process .    for an example , consider generating a discrete - time markov chain @xmath36 on the finite space of graphs with vertex set @xmath15 $ ] . at any time @xmath37 ,",
    "given @xmath38 , we can generate a transition to a new state @xmath39 as follows . independently for each pair @xmath34 , we flip a coin to determine whether to put an edge between @xmath21 and @xmath23 in @xmath39 : if @xmath33 is _ on _ in @xmath40 , we flip a @xmath41-coin ; otherwise , we flip a @xmath42-coin .",
    "this description results in a simple , exchangeable markov chain on finite graphs , which we call the _ erds  rnyi rewiring chain _ ( section  [ section : er ] ) .",
    "more general transitions are possible , for example , edges need not evolve independently .",
    "we use the next markov chain as a running example of a discrete - time rewiring chain .",
    "we fix @xmath30 and regard an undirected graph @xmath40 with vertex set @xmath15 $ ] as a @xmath43-valued symmetric matrix @xmath44 such that @xmath45 for all @xmath46 ; that is , we represent a graph by its adjacency matrix with @xmath47 . for any pair of graphs @xmath48",
    ", we can compute the statistic @xmath49 , where for @xmath50 , @xmath51 for example , @xmath52 is the number of pairs @xmath53 for which the status of @xmath33 changes from @xmath54 to @xmath55 from @xmath40 to @xmath39 .",
    "we use @xmath56 as a sufficient statistic to define the transition probability @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the sufficient statistic @xmath56 is invariant under joint relabeling of the vertices of @xmath48 and so the transition law is exchangeable .",
    "furthermore , @xmath60 is reversible with respect to @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the distribution @xmath64 arises as a mixture of erds  rnyi random graphs with respect to the @xmath65 distribution .",
    "furthermore , @xmath66 is a consistent collection of transition probabilities and , therefore , determines a unique transition probability ( and hence markov chain ) on the space of infinite graphs with vertex set @xmath67 .",
    "though consistency is not immediately obvious for the above family , the savvy reader might anticipate it : the formula for @xmath68 involves rising factorials ( i.e. , gamma functions ) , which also appear in other consistent combinatorial stochastic processes , for example , the chinese restaurant process @xcite and the beta - splitting model for fragmentation trees @xcite .",
    "we need not prove consistency explicitly for this model ; it follows from our more general construction of rewiring processes , all of which are consistent ( theorem  [ thm : consistent rewiring chain ] ) .",
    "we discuss the above family further in section  [ section : er ] .      throughout the paper ,",
    "we construct exchangeable and consistent markov processes using a special _ rewiring measure _",
    "( section  [ section : exchangeable rewiring maps ] ) . in continuous - time",
    ", markov processes can admit infinitely many jumps in arbitrarily small time intervals ; however , by the consistency assumption , any edge can change only finitely often in bounded intervals . in this case",
