    "one of the central paradigms in extragalactic astronomy is that today s galaxies host supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at their centers and have a symbiotic evolution with them @xcite .",
    "the central black holes seeded in proto - galaxies at high redshift grow in mass during cosmic history through a sequence of mergers of massive black holes and accretion episodes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the massive black holes grow in such a way that they co - evolve with the galactic bulges @xcite but do not seem to do so with the galaxy disks @xcite or dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "the growth of smbhs is dominated by the quasar phase @xcite during which they accrete from their large gas reservoir via geometrically thin accretion disks which are radiatively efficient @xcite as suggested by different lines of evidence @xcite .",
    "the quasar population has a strong cosmological evolution with its density decreasing by a factor of @xmath0 from @xmath1  where the density reaches its peak  to the present time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the present - day universe ,",
    "smbhs are underfed compared to the ones at high @xmath2 and are `` sleeping '' .",
    "most of smbh activity at low @xmath2 is dominated by the weak end of the agn luminosity function in the form of low - luminosity agns ( llagns ; @xcite ) .",
    "though the llagn phase dominates the time evolution of smbhs , it contributes little to their mass growth @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the llagn population ( @xmath3 ; @xcite ) reside in low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ; @xcite ) .",
    "llagns are extremely sub - eddington systems which are many orders of magnitude less luminous than quasars , with average bolometric luminosities @xmath4 and an average eddington ratio of @xmath5 @xcite where @xmath6 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "the observational properties of llagns are quite different from those of more luminous agns . regarding the broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , llagns seem not to have the thermal continuum prominence in the ultraviolet ( uv )  the `` big blue bump ''  which is one of the signatures of the presence of an optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disk @xcite",
    ". regarding the emission - lines , llagns typically have weak and narrow fe k@xmath7 emission @xcite and a handful of liners display broad double - peaked h@xmath7 lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; these properties of the emission - line spectrum are consistent with the absence of a thin accretion disk , or a thin accretion disk whose inner radius is truncated at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "last but not least , with the typical fuel supply of hot diffuse gas ( via bondi accretion ) and cold dense gas ( via stellar mass loss ) available in nearby galaxies , llagns would be expected to produce much higher luminosities than observed on the assumption of standard thin disks with a @xmath9 radiative efficiency @xcite .",
    "taken together , this set of observational properties favors the scenario in which the accretion flow in llagns is advection - dominated or radiatively inefficient .",
    "advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ; for reviews see @xcite ) are very hot , geometrically thick , optically thin flows which are typified by low radiative efficiencies ( @xmath10 ) and occur at low accretion rates ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "smbhs are thought to spend most of their lives in the adaf state @xcite , the best studied individual case being sgr a * ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in many llagns , another component in the accretion flow besides the adaf is required in order to account for different observations , including a `` red bump '' in the seds @xcite and as mentioned before the double - peaked balmer emission lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) : the emission from a thin accretion disk whose inner radius is truncated at the outer radius of the adaf . in many llagns the accretion flow may begin as a standard thin disk but somehow at a certain transition radius the accretion flow abruptly switches from a cold to a hot adaf mode .",
    "the details of how this transition might happen are still not well understood @xcite , but it seems to be analogous to the transition between the different spectral states in black hole binary systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite challenged the scenario of the central engines of llagns consisting of adafs and truncated thin disks .",
    "maoz argues that llagns in liners have uv / x - ray luminosity ratios similar on average to those of brighter seyfert 1s and based on that observation he posits that thin disks extending all the way down to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbits ( isco ) persist even for llagns , despite their smaller accretion rates .",
    "@xcite showed that the seds compiled by @xcite are naturally fitted by adaf models with the addition of a truncated thin disk and also discussed on theoretical grounds why the adaf model has a superior explanation capability than the pure thin disk model .",
    "the adaf model is the only model that can naturally account for the set of observational properties of llagns within a self - contained theoretical framework .",
    "hence , it is the physical scenario adopted in this work .",
    "adafs are relevant to the understanding of agn feedback since they are quite efficient at producing powerful outflows and jets , as suggested by theoretical studies including analytical theory @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite ) .",
    "this is in line with the different observational studies which demonstrate that llagns are generally radio - loud @xcite and accompanied by powerful jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the so - called `` radio mode '' of agn feedback invoked in semi - analytic and hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) would presumably correspond to the adaf accretion state actively producing jets as explicitly incorporated in some works @xcite .",
    "it is clear that an understanding of the physical nature of llagns in liners will shed light on the nature of black hole accretion , outflows and consequently black hole growth and agn feedback in present - day galaxies .",
    "one of the best ways of exploring the astrophysics of black hole accretion and outflows is by using multiwavelength observations of black hole systems and comparing the spectra predicted by specific models with the data .",
    "the goal of this work is therefore to probe the physics of accretion and ejection in the llagn population , by modeling their nuclear , broadband , radio to x - rays seds which provide constraints on physical models for the emission of the accretion flow and the jet .",
    "furthermore , with a large enough sample of systems , we can derive from the fits to the data the parameters that characterize the central engines and build a census of the `` astrophysical diet '' of low - state agns .    in this work",
    ", we will present how the currently favored model for the central engines of weakly accreting black holes is able to account for the observed seds of llagns .",
    "we will also present the typical accretion / ejection  or feeding / feedback  properties of llagns in liners as inferred from our detailed sed fits . with these parameters",
    ", we will then be able to draw a connection between the smbhs in nearby active galaxies and the one in the milky way , sgr a*. we will also present the inferred production site of the continuum emission and other properties inferred from the fits .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : sample ]",
    "we describe the sample of 21 llagns in liners that we used , the data and classifications .",
    "section [ sec : models ] describes the physical model that we adopted in order to interpret and fit the seds and derive the central engine parameters . in section [ sec : seds ] we describe the model fits to the seds , explaining in more detail the sed models for 5 objects which we consider the `` reference '' or fiducial llagn examples .",
    "section [ ap : seds ] presents the model fits to the other 16 seds in our sample . in section [ sec : pars ] we describe the distributions of central engine parameters resulting from our detailed model fits .",
    "we present the average sed resulting from our fits  including the predicted emission in wavebands which can be observed with future facilities such as alma and the james webb space telescope  and the inferred nature of the broadband emission in each wavelength in [ sec : avgsed ] .",
    "we discuss in [ sec : disc ] which model is favored to explain our llagn sample , in particular which component in the flow dominates the x - ray emission .",
    "we conclude by presenting a summary of our results in [ sec : end ] and comparing the smbh `` diet '' of massive black holes in liner agns and sgr a*.",
    "@xcite ( hereafter ehf10 ) compiled a sample of 35 seds of llagns found in liners which include high spatial resolution optical and uv observations with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) , as well as x - ray observations with _",
    "most of the seds studied by ehf10 have also high - resolution radio ( observed with the very large array ",
    "vla  or vlba / vlbi ) and infrared observations available .",
    "in order to select the best seds to be modelled from the sample of ehf10 , we applied the following selection criteria : we selected only those objects for which their x - ray flux is not an upper limit .",
    "we also demand that there is a determination of the black hole mass .",
    "these selection criteria leave us with 24 liners . in three of these objects ( ngc 404 , ngc 5055 and ngc 6500 )",
    "the emission is likely to be dominated by a stellar population ( ehf10 ) .",

    "group a contains the objects that have the data with the best quality available .",
    "for instance , the radio , optical and uv bands have each at least one data point which is not an upper limit to the luminosity .",
    "obviously , the objects in this group provide better constraints to the accretion - jet models .",
    "group b comprises the sources that provide not as good contraints to the models , because they lack observational constraints in the radio to uv region of the spectrum .",
    "some objects in this group have only upper limits to the flux in the uv , others have no data points or only upper limits in the radio band .",
    "all the objects in both groups have observations in the near - ir band which are treated as upper limits .",
    "we take this approach because the observations in the near - ir were taken with lower spatial resolutions , i.e. larger apertures that include considerable contamination from the emission of the host galaxy . therefore , near - ir observations can only be considered as upper limits to the nuclear emission .",
    "the masses of the smbhs were estimated from the stellar velocity dispersions using the @xmath63 relationship @xcite , with the exception of ngc 266 , whose black hole mass was estimated from the measured 5 ghz radio and the 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosities using the correlation of @xcite ( the `` fundamental plane of black hole activity '' ) , and ngc 3031 ( m81 ) and ngc 4486 ( m87 ) whose black hole masses were estimated from the stellar and/or gas kinematics ( @xcite ; see table [ tab : sample ] ) . as ehf10 note , for the objects with multiple mass determinations using different methods , the estimated masses are consistent with each other within a factor of 2 . due to the intrinsic scatter in the fundamental plane ,",
    "the mass estimated for ngc 266 is subject to an uncertainty by a factor of @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the optical - uv data of all objects were corrected for extinction as discussed in ehf10 . in order to compute the bolometric luminosities from the seds ,",
    "ehf10 used two methods .",
    "for the objects with the best sampled seds , they computed @xmath65 by integrating the seds directly , ignoring upper limit data points .",
    "the objects with well - sampled seds are ngc 3031 , ngc 3998 , ngc 4374 , ngc 4486 , ngc 4579 and ngc 4594 .",
    "for these objects they assumed that pairs of neighboring points in the seds defined a power law , integrated each segment individually and summed the segments to obtain @xmath65 .",
    "from this set of best sampled seds they estimated the average `` bolometric correction '' from the 2 - 10 kev luminosity to the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath66 ) , which they used to obtain @xmath65 for the remaining objects , for which the seds are not as well sampled .",
    "these bolometric luminosities are listed in table [ tab : sample ] .",
    "we fit the observed broadband seds of the llagns in our sample using a model which consists of three components : an inner adaf , an outer truncated thin accretion disk and a jet .",
    "the components of the model are illustrated in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "we describe here the main features of this model .",
    "the inner part of the accretion flow is in the form of an adaf which is a hot , geometrically thick , optically thin two - temperature accretion flow , which has low radiative efficiency ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "adafs are characterized by the presence of outflows or winds , which prevent a considerable fraction of the gas that is available at large radii from being accreted onto the black hole .",
    "this has been suggested by numerical simulations @xcite and analytical work @xcite .",
    "in addition , observational studies suggest that winds coming from the inner parts of accretion flows are ubiquitous in agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) and it is natural to take them into account when studying the llagn population .    in order to take this mass - loss into account ,",
    "we follow @xcite and introduce the parameter @xmath67 by @xmath68 to describe the radial variation of the accretion rate @xmath69 measured at the outer radius of the adaf , @xmath70 . following the results of numerical simulations of the dynamics of adafs , in our models we allow @xmath67 to vary over the range @xmath71 , taking into account the current uncertainty in the determination of the amount of gas that is lost via winds in the accretion flow .",
    "the other parameters that describe the adaf solution are the black hole mass @xmath72 ; the viscosity parameter @xmath7 ; the modified plasma @xmath73 parameter , defined as the ratio between the gas and total pressures , @xmath74 ; @xmath75 , the fraction of energy dissipated via turbulence that directly heats electrons ; and the adiabatic index @xmath76 . in our calculations , we adopt @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "traditional adaf models adopted @xmath75 to be small ( @xmath80 ; e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been argued that the value of @xmath75 can be potentially increased due to different physical processes - such as magnetic reconnection - that affect the heating of protons and electrons in hot plasmas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "given the theoretical uncertainty related to the value of @xmath75 , we allow it to vary over the range @xmath81 .    the case in which @xmath82 and @xmath83 deserves special attention , since these values were obtained from fitting current adaf models to the sed of sgr a * @xcite .",
    "we note that while @xcite fix the values of @xmath75 and @xmath67 in their fits , we leave these parameters free taking into account the theoretical uncertainties",
    ". there are degeneracies between @xmath67 and @xmath75 when fitting the data with adaf models @xcite , such that different combinations of the values of these parameters may result in similar seds .",
    "the cooling mechanisms incorporated in the calculations are synchrotron emission , bremsstrahlung and inverse comptonization of the seed photons produced by the first two radiative processes .",
    "given the values of the parameters of the adaf , in order to compute its spectrum we first numerically solve for the global structure and dynamics of the flow , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "obtaining the global solution of the differential equations for the structure of the accretion flow is a two - point boundary value problem .",
    "this problem is solved numerically using the shooting method , by varying the eigenvalue @xmath84 ( the specific angular momentum of the flow at the horizon ) until the sonic point condition at the sonic radius @xmath85 is satisfied , in addition to the outer boundary conditions .",
    "there are three outer boundary conditions that the adaf solution must satisfy , specified in terms of the three variables of the problem : the ion temperature @xmath86 , the electron temperature @xmath87 and the radial velocity @xmath88 ( or equivalently the angular velocity @xmath89 ) .",
    "following @xcite , when the outer boundary of the adaf is at the radius @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 is the schwarzschild radius ) we adopt the outer boundary conditions @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , where the virial temperature is given by @xmath95 , @xmath96 is the mach number and @xmath97 is the adiabatic sound speed .",
    "when the outer boundary is at @xmath98 we adopt the boundary conditions @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "after the global solution is calculated , the spectrum of the accretion flow is obtained ( see e.g. , @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we verified that if these boundary conditions are varied by a factor of a few , the resulting spectrum does not change much .",
    "outside the adaf there is an outer thin accretion disk with an inner radius truncated at @xmath102 and extending up to @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , in practice the outer radius of the adaf corresponds to the transition radius to the thin disk .",
    "the other parameters that describe the thin disk solution are the inclination angle @xmath104 , the black hole mass and the accretion rate @xmath69 ( the same as the accretion rate at the outer boundary of the adaf ) . in the cases where @xmath105 we simply ignore the contribution of the thin disk spectrum .",
    "the thin disk emits locally as a blackbody and we take into account the reprocessing of the x - ray radiation from the adaf .",
    "this reprocessing effect has only a little impact on the spectrum of the thin disk though , with the resulting sed being almost identical to that of a standard thin disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the seds of llagns are generally radio - loud ( @xcite ; ehf10 ) ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "the radio prominence of these seds is usually explained by invoking the synchrotron emission of relativistic jets , since the the accretion flow does not produce enough radio emission to account for the observed radio luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some authors even argue that the entire sed of llagns may be explained by the jet component ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore include in our modelling the contribution from the emission from a relativistic jet .",
    "we adopt a jet model based on the internal shock scenario which is used to interpret gamma - ray burst afterglows ( e.g. , @xcite ; see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this model has been adopted in previous works to understand the broadband seds of x - ray binaries and agns @xcite . according to this jet model",
    ", some fraction of the material in the innermost regions of the accretion flow is transferred to the jet producing an outflow rate @xmath106 and a standing shock wave in the region of the jet closest to the black hole is formed .",
    "this shock wave is created from the bending of the supersonic accretion flow near the black hole in the direction of the jet .",
    "we calculate the shock jump ( rankine - hugoniot ) conditions to find the electron and ion temperatures of the plasma ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) .",
    "we find that the jet spectrum is not very sensitive to changes in @xmath107 and @xmath108 , since the emission is completely dominated by non - thermal electrons ( see below ) .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath109 and @xmath110 in our calculations of the jet emission .",
    "the jet is modelled as having a conical geometry with half - opening angle @xmath111 and a bulk lorentz factor @xmath112 which are independent of the distance from the black hole .",
    "the jet is along the axis of the adaf and makes an angle @xmath104 with the line of sight .",
    "the internal shocks in the jet are presumably created by the collisions of shells of plasma with different velocities .",
    "these shocks accelerate a small fraction @xmath113 of the electrons into a power - law energy distribution with index @xmath114 .",
    "the energy density of accelerated electrons and the amplified magnetic field are described by two free parameters , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt in our calculations of the jet emission the values @xmath117 radians , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , which corresponds to @xmath120 ( except in the case of m87 , which has an independent estimate of @xmath112 available ) .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we adopt @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , there are four free parameters in the jet model : @xmath106 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in our calculations",
    "we consider the synchrotron emission of the jet , with the optically thick part of the synchrotron spectrum contributing mainly in the radio and the optically thin part contributing mainly in the x - rays .",
    "when fitting the observed seds with our coupled accretion - jet model , we have eight free parameters .",
    "four of these parameters describe the emission of the accretion flow : the accretion rate @xmath69 , the transition radius between the inner adaf and the outer truncated thin disk @xmath122 , the fraction of viscously dissipated energy that directly heats the electrons @xmath75 and the strength of the wind from the adaf @xmath67 .",
    "the other four parameters characterize the jet emission : the mass - loss rate in the jet @xmath106 , the electron energy spectral index @xmath114 , and the electron and magnetic energy parameters @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath106 are obviously expected to be correlated , but given our ignorance about the mechanism of jet formation we vary these parameters independently in our fits .",
    "we require for consistency that @xmath123 . since the adaf loses mass via winds ( equation [ eq : massloss ] ) , it is also of interest to check the value of @xmath124 , in which the accretion rate is calculated at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit for a schwarzschild black hole .    throughout this paper",
    "we will use the dimensionless mass accretion rates @xmath125 , noting that the eddington accretion rate is defined as @xmath126 assuming a @xmath9 radiative efficiency .",
    "we will also express the black hole mass in terms of the mass of the sun , @xmath127 , and the radius in terms of the schwarzschild radius , @xmath128 .",
    "our fitting procedure can be summarized as follows .",
    "we vary the free jet parameters in order to fit the radio observations , since the radio is emitted predominantly by the jet .",
    "once we fit the radio band with the jet model , we try to fit the truncated thin disk model to the ir - optical data , in order to constrain the transition radius and @xmath69 ( keeping in mind that the theoretical spectrum should not exceed the observed luminosities ) .",
    "we then use the x - ray data to constrain the adaf component in order to refine the estimates of @xmath122 and @xmath69 , and to estimate @xmath67 and @xmath75 . depending on the combination of parameters that we use",
    ", the jet can have an important contribution to the emission not only in the radio , but also in the x - ray band .",
    "we sum the emission of the inner adaf , outer thin disk and jet , and compare this sum with the observed seds .",
    "we explore the parameter space of the models considering the many possible fits to the data .",
    "we search the literature for independent constraints from other works on the values of the model parameters , such as the mass accretion rate , inclination angle and the transition radius , as well as the jet power which is obtained from the jet model .",
    "we describe in this section the results obtained from fitting our coupled accretion - jet model to the seds that were selected using our selection criteria in section [ sec : sample ] .",
    "we describe in more detail the results for ngc 4594 ( [ sec : n4594 ] ) , ngc 4374 ( [ sec : m84 ] ) , ngc 4486 ( [ sec : m87 ] ) , ngc 3031 ( [ sec : m81 ] ) and ngc 3998 ( [ sec : n3998 ] ) .",
    "these five objects will serve as the `` reference '' examples that will illustrate the general results for the whole sample .",
    "these objects were chosen for a more detailed discussion because of their good multiwavelength sampling .",
    "we show the model fits to the other 16 seds and the resulting model parameters in section [ ap : seds ] .    in the sed plots that follow below , the error bars",
    "represent the uncertainty in the extinction corrections applied to the the optical - uv data by ehf10 .",
    "the lower bars correspond to the measurements without any extinction correction , while the upper bars represent the same observations after a maximal extinction correction ( see ehf10 ) .",
    "the arrows represent upper limits to the nuclear luminosity .",
    "these upper limits are caused by either non - detections , or because the corresponding observations were taken at lower spatial resolutions . in the latter case ,",
    "the upper limits include a potentially significant contamination by the emission from the host galaxy .",
    "this happens particularly for the observations in the near - ir band .",

    "for instance , this procedure was carried out by ehf10 who also computed a bolometric correction for the x - ray luminosity . in our case , we have physically motivated fits for the 21 seds . therefore , for each liner in our sample , we calculated @xmath65 by integrating the total sed . carrying this out using the seds obtained according to the ad scenario we obtain the average value of @xmath298 with a standard deviation of @xmath284 dex . for the sed fits computed according to the jd scenario",
    "we find a corresponding average of 41.3 with a similar standard deviation , which gives the same average as the one computed using the bolometric luminosities estimated by ehf10 .",
    "figure [ fig : lumbol ] displays the distribution of values of @xmath65 resulting from the models compared with the one estimated by ehf10 .        defining the x - ray bolometric correction as @xmath299 , we calculated the average bolometric correction @xmath300 resulting from our models as 1.45 and 1.35 according to the ad and jd scenarios respectively , with standard deviations of 0.36 dex ( ad ) and 0.46 dex ( jd ) .",
    "the corresponding geometric means of @xmath301 are 28 ( ad ) and 22 ( jd ) , the mean values are 43 ( ad ) and 47 ( jd ) and the medians are 22 ( ad ) and 14 ( jd ) .",
    "our models result in values of @xmath301 which are somewhat lower than those estimated by ehf10 .    using our sed models we can calculate what is the typical fraction of the accreted matter that is converted into the combined radiation of the accretion flow and the jet , i.e. the radiative efficiency @xmath302 ( note that the accretion rate in the definition of this efficiency is the one at the outer radius of the adaf ) .",

    "the reason for the smaller jet powers in the ad fits compared to the jd ones is that the mass - loss rates required in the former fits are systematically smaller than in the ones in which the jet has a higher degree of contribution in the x - rays .",
    "based on our results and given the degeneracy in the fits , we can say that the typical kinetic to radiative power ratio of llagns is @xmath309 ( i.e. the average of the value from the ad and jd fits ) .",

    "first and foremost , since the observed seds are the main observables that we use to derive the central engine parameters via our fitting , as a consistency check the average model seds should reproduce the average sed obtained directly from the observed ones .    secondly , seds obtained from averaging observed data points are obviously limited by the observed bands . outside the observed bands different authors adopt _ ad - hoc _ interpolations between the data , usually a linear interpolation in log - log space ( @xcite ; ehf10 ) , which might not reflect the actual physical processes involved in the emission .",
    "the average from the ad and jd scenarios that we obtained can hence serve as guidelines  with a physical justification  to the typical shape of the seds in the bands which have not been constrained yet .    motivated by the reasons above , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : avgsed]a the average seds computed separately for the ad and jd scenarios .",
    "we first normalized the individual seds to the same x - ray luminosity of @xmath310 in the band 2 - 10 kev .",
    "this value is approximately the average x - ray luminosity for the liners in our sample .",
    "after normalizing the seds , for each frequency bin we computed the geometric mean of the model seds corresponding to the particular model class as @xmath311 .",
    "following ehf10 we choose to compute the average of the logarithm of the luminosities instead of using the values of @xmath312 themselves in order to reduce the effect of outliers in the resulting average .",
    "the different bumps in the average model seds reflect the different physical processes that operate in the flows . in the average ad model",
    "sed , the different bands are dominated by different radiative processes in the flow as described below :    1 m  1 mm : :    jet optically thick synchrotron emission",
    ". 1 mm  @xmath313 m : :    the first bump and usually the strongest one in the average ad sed is    due to the adaf synchrotron emission .",
    "@xmath314 m  @xmath315 m : :    the second bump is due to the thermal emission from the truncated thin    disk .",
    "@xmath316 m  0.1 kev : :    there is a weak uv bump due to the first inverse compton scattering of    synchrotron photons in the adaf .",
    "@xmath317 kev  100 kev : :    the last bump in x - rays is dominated by the second inverse compton    scattering of synchrotron photons in the adaf .",
    "the average jd sed is more simple and has only one bump in the ir between a few @xmath318 m  a few @xmath319 m which is due to the truncated thin disk .",
    "the rest of the emission is due to synchrotron photons from the jet .",
    "overall , the spectral shapes of the average jd and ad seds are quite similar in the radio and x - rays above 1 kev . in between these bands the shapes are slightly dissimilar .",
    "the bumps in the average seds are much less pronounced than the bumps in the individual seds .",
    "this occurs because the bumps in the individual seds do not peak at the same place and when the seds are averaged these bumps are smoothed out . for this reason , the average model seds will not resemble any one of the individual seds .",
    "figure [ fig : avgsed]a also displays the average data points computed from the observed seds in a similar way by ehf10 where the error bars represent the uncertainty in the emission due to the uncertainty affecting the amount of extinction correction involved .",

    "there are some details that are worth mentioning .",
    "the shape of the x - ray spectrum of the average jd sed is slightly softer than the corresponding shape of the average ad sed .",
    "both are within the @xmath320 uncertainty in the photon index of the average observed sed . in the ouv , even though the model seds agree with the observed constraints they are quite different from each other .",
    "for instance , the red bump is stronger in the average jd sed .",
    "the average jd sed predicts a lower level of uv flux . in the radio band ,",
    "the model seds are quite similar to each other .",
    "figure [ fig : qsoavg ] shows the average ad and jd seds compared to the average ones of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars computed by @xcite .",
    "the average quasar seds computed by @xcite are very similar to the ones of @xcite but the former include more detailed features , and are based on more recent data obtained with improved instrumentation . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : avgsed]a , the seds were normalized such that they all have the same x - ray luminosity in the 2 - 10 kev band of @xmath310 .",
    "the uv excess in the quasar seds ( the big blue bump ) is clearly apparent in comparison to the llagn ones .",
    "it is also interesting that for @xmath321 hz the average ad , average jd and the radio - loud quasar seds are quite similar .",
    "in our ad models , the x - rays are produced predominantly by inverse compton scattering by the adaf of seed synchrotron photons produced in the accretion flow itself ; in contrast , in our jd models , the x - rays are dominated by the optically thin synchrotron emission in the base of the jet . in this regard ,",
    "the _ chandra _ x - ray spectrum is one of the most important constraints for the origin of high - energy photons in llagns .",
    "there are only two objects for which the ad or the jd can be ruled out , within the observational uncertainties and the explored model parameter space : ngc 1553 ( [ sec:1553 ] ) and ngc 4552 ( [ sec:4552 ] ) . for ngc 1553",
    ", the jd model does not reproduce the hardness of the x - ray spectrum whereas for ngc 4552 the ad model is not able to account for the corresponding x - ray softness .",
    "for the remaining objects , by inspecting the sed fits we can see that both the ad and the jd models are able to reproduce with varying degrees of success the whole sed from radio to x - rays , in particular the x - ray portion .    in order",
    "to quantify which model systematically fits better the broadband seds we use as a goodness - of - fit parameter a modified @xmath322 .",
    "we define this modified @xmath322 simply as @xmath323 where @xmath324 and the sum is carried over the observed data points .",
    "we sample the x - ray continuum using 3 data points from 0.5 kev to 10 kev and we do not take into account upper limit data points .",
    "the values of @xmath322 for each model are displayed in table [ tab : models ] .",
    "considering the 20 objects for which we were able to obtain both jd and ad fits , we find that @xmath325 for 9 objects and @xmath326 for the remaining 8 .",
    "in other words , for 9 objects ( 10 including ngc 4552 for which we did not find an appropriate ad fit ) the jd results in better sed fits as opposed to 8 for which the ad model is a better fit .",
    "the results from this goodness - of - fit test show that 52% of the seds in our sample are better fitted by the jd model whereas 38% are better reproduced by the ad scenario .",
    "for the 3 objects with @xmath327 ( ngc 1097 , ngc 3998 and ngc 4374 ) it is hard to tell  based on the broadband sed alone  which model provides a better fit .",
    "we should point out a number of caveats involved when considering which scenario better accounts for the nature of the x - ray emission . from an observational point of view , even though we are carrying the largest systematic analysis of the seds of llagns in liners done up to date , the size of our sample is limited .",
    "we need to extend our modeling to a larger number of llagns in order to increase the statistics and draw further conclusions .",
    "secondly , for many sources we only have a few data points available to fit , so clearly for these objects we need to obtain more measurements to better constrain the models .",
    "in addition , in our modeling we find that one of the main observables that help to pinpoint the dominant source of x - rays is the hardness of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "adaf models tend to predict harder x - ray spectra while jet models predict softer ones . in most of the llagns in our sample there is a significant observational uncertainty in the x - ray hardness derived from the _ chandra _ observations which make it difficult to determine which whether the ad or jd is favored based on the x - ray spectrum .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", there are considerable theoretical uncertainties involved in the the adaf - jet models . for instance , the values of the model parameters that affect the microphysics and dynamics of the adaf and jet are not sufficiently constrained .",
    "in particular , @xmath75 and @xmath114 have a large impact on the hardness of the x - ray spectrum predicted by adaf / jet models but there is a considerable uncertainty in the range of possible values of these parameters despite recent progress ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "considering the overall goodness - of - fit of the ad and jd models , it is important to point out that our jet model is basically a phenomenological one .",
    "uncertainties affecting for example the jet model could translate in larger values of @xmath322 .",
    "for instance , when we find @xmath325 , that could be possibly because the jd model is less well constrained than the ad one , i.e , we have more freedom in the jet fitting compared to the adaf model .    taking into account these caveats ,",
    "it is still premature to favor one model over the other based only on the sed . the nature of the x - ray emission in llagns has been debated in the last few years by several authors favoring in some cases the ad or jd models based on the analysis of individual sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) or in a statistical sense based on the fundamental plane of black hole activity @xcite .",
    "we suggest different routes to clarify this issue in the future .",
    "the ad and jd models should predict different characteristic radio and x - ray variability timescales ( e.g. , @xcite ) , hence we should be able to test which component is dominant in x - rays by carrying out a simultaneous monitoring of the variability of radio and x - rays . by comparing the variability pattern predicted by jet / adaf models we could pinpoint the x - ray dominant component .",
    "this promising strategy is quite similar to what the observational campaigns carried out for m81 @xcite and the radio - quiet seyfert 1 ngc 4051 @xcite and could be applied to many other llagns .",
    "we note that in the case of m81 , @xcite favor a scenario in which the x - rays originate in the transition region between the thin disk and the adaf ; ngc 4051 is a different case since it is a relatively bright agn accreting at the @xmath328 level @xcite and its jet - disk coupling is quite distinct compared to llagns .    the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope can be quite helpful in this regard .",
    "llagns are potential sources of @xmath76-rays @xcite and in fact one of the source in this sample ( ngc 4486 ) has already been detected by the _ fermi _",
    "lat @xcite . by using the model parameters that we derived in our radio - to - x - rays fits we should be able to predict the @xmath76-ray spectrum @xcite and compare with future _ fermi _ detections . in this way",
    "we should be able to compare ad / jd predictions and through @xmath76-ray observations place further constraints on the production site responsible for the high - energy emission and the jet - disk connection in llagns .",
    "observations in the mm and sub - mm are also very helpful because they constrain the adaf synchrotron emission and hence also the x - ray emission .",
    "this follows because the synchrotron photons in the adaf are inverse - compton - scattered to x - rays .",
    "finally , further refinements and a better understanding of the fundamental plane of black hole activity @xcite should make the fundamental plane a better tool for constraining the radiative processes shaping the radio and x - ray emission in sub - eddington black hole source and by consequence llagns .",
    "we performed detailed modeling of the broadband  radio - to - x - rays  spectral energy distributions of a sample of 21 low - luminosity agns in liners selected from ehf10 . with this exploratory modeling ,",
    "our goal is to constrain the general properties of the central engines of the dominant population of agns at @xmath329 .",
    "our coupled accretion - jet model consists of an accretion flow which is radiatively inefficient in the inner parts and becomes a thin disk outside a certain transition radius .",
    "the relativistic jet is modeled in the framework of the internal shock scenario .",
    "we demonstrated that there are two classes of models that can explain the majority of the observed seds .",
    "we call the first one ad which stands for `` adaf - dominated '' since the adaf dominates most of the broadband emission , particularly the x - rays . in the second class of models , the jet component dominates the majority of the continuum emission and for this reason we call this scenario jd as in `` jet - dominated '' .",
    "the seds predicted by the ad models have a more complex shape than the jd ones , given the richer variety of radiative processes involved in adafs .",
    "for both scenarios though , the radio band is almost always dominated by the synchrotron emission from the jet and the near ir to optical band is dominated by the truncated thin disk thermal emission .",
    "mass accretion rates : :    based on the ad models , the values of the accretion rates supplied to    the accretion flow lie in the range    @xmath330 in eddington units with a mean    @xmath278 or    alternatively    @xmath279    ( standard deviations of @xmath308 dex respectively ) .    of that gas supply , typically only @xmath331 is accreted    onto the black hole with the remaining gas being lost due to outflows .",

    "kinetic to radiative output ratio : :    llagns typically release @xmath309 times more kinetic    power in the jets than the total energy radiated away .",

    "there are theoretical and observational sources of uncertainty in the values of the derived parameters .",
    "for instance , there are degeneracies between the effect of the model parameters on the resulting seds @xcite . the uncertainty in the ouv  due to uncertain degree of extinction correction  and",
    "the x - ray data also contribute to uncertainty in the estimated parameters .",
    "furthermore , our sample is currently limited to 21 objects . in spite of these caveats ,",
    "the estimates we obtained for the properties of central engines of liner agns should be illustrative of the general behavior of the class .",
    "we can draw a link between the supermassive black holes in liners and the quiescent black hole in our galaxy , sgr a*. by modelling the sed of sgr a * with adaf models , an accretion rate of @xmath341 was estimated @xcite .",
    "this value is two orders of magnitude below the typical accretion rate of liners that we estimated .",

    "<S> low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagns ) represent the bulk of the agn population in the present - day universe and they trace the low - level accreting supermassive black holes . in order to probe the accretion and jet physical properties in llagns as a class , we model the broadband radio to x - rays spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of 21 llagns in low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) with a coupled accretion - jet model . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion flow is modeled as an inner adaf outside of which there is a truncated standard thin disk . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the radio emission is severely underpredicted by adaf models and is explained by the relativistic jet . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the x - ray radiation in most sources can be explained by three distinct scenarios : the x - rays can be dominated by emission from the adaf , or the jet , or the x - rays can arise from a jet - adaf combination in which both components contribute to the emission with similar importance . for 3 objects both the jet and adaf fit </S>",
    "<S> equally well the x - ray spectrum and can be the dominant source of x - rays whereas for 11 llagns a jet - dominated model accounts better than the adaf - dominated model for the data . </S>",
    "<S> the individual and average sed models that we computed can be useful for different studies of the nuclear emission of llagns . from the model </S>",
    "<S> fits , we estimate important parameters of the central engine powering llagns in liners , such as the mass accretion rate and the mass - loss rate in the jet and the jet power - relevant for studies of the kinetic feedback from jets . </S>"
