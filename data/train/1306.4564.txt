    "branched cyclic covers of @xmath0 have played a major role in topology , and continue to appear in a wide variety of contexts . for example , branched cyclic covers of @xmath0 branched over two - bridge knots have recently appeared in combinatorial work bounding the matveev complexity of a 3-manifold @xcite , in algebraic and topological work determining relations between @xmath1-spaces , left - orderability , and taut foliations @xcite , and in geometric work giving information on maps of character varieties @xcite .",
    "they provide a wealth of examples , and a useful collection of manifolds on which to study conjectures . given their wide applicability , and their continued relevance , it is useful to have many explicit descriptions of these manifolds .    in this paper , we give a new and particularly elegant construction of the branched cyclic covers of two - bridge knots , using the bi - twist construction of @xcite .",
    "while other presentations of these manifolds are known ( see , for example @xcite ) , we feel our descriptions have several advantages , as follows .",
    "first , they follow from a recipe involving exactly the parameters necessary to describe a two - bridge knot , namely , continued fraction parameters .",
    "our descriptions apply uniformly to all two - bridge knots , and all branched cyclic covers of @xmath0 branched over two - bridge knots .",
    "second , they are obtained from a description of a two - bridge knot using a particularly straight - forward bi - twisted face pairing construction , as in @xcite .",
    "bi - twisted face - pairings are known to produce all closed orientable 3-manifolds .",
    "the examples of this paper show , in addition , that bi - twist constructions are often efficient and natural . while a generic face - pairing will yield a pseudomanifold , which , with probability 1 , will not be an actual manifold  @xcite , bi - twisted face - pairings avoid this problem . in this paper",
    ", we will review necessary information on bi - twisted face pairings , so no prior specialized knowledge is required to understand our constructions .",
    "third , our description leads to immediate consequences in geometric group theory .",
    "we obtain a simple proof of the fact that the fundamental group of the @xmath2-fold branched cyclic covering of @xmath0 , branched over a two - bridge knot , has a cyclic presentation .",
    "our description also gives immediate presentations of two well known families of groups , the fibonacci and sieradski groups .",
    "these are known to arise as fundamental groups of branched cyclic covers of @xmath0 branched over the figure - eight and trefoil knots , respectively .",
    "these groups have received considerable attention from geometric group theorists ; see , for example  @xcite for further references , and section  [ sec - history ] for more history .",
    "our methods recover the fact that the first homology groups of sieradski manifolds are periodic .",
    "we also give a proof that their fundamental groups are distinct using milnor s characterization of these spaces .",
    "we consider orders of abelianizations of fibonacci groups , as well .",
    "these orders form an interesting sequence related to the fibonacci sequence , which we shall see .",
    "we will see that the bi - twist description of any two - bridge knot is encoded as the image of the north - south axis in a ball labeled as in figure  [ fig - tbf1 ] , along with an associated vector of integer multipliers . for the branched cyclic",
    "cover , the description is encoded by adding additional longitudinal arcs to the sphere .",

    "the multiplier @xmath30 is usually forbidden , but in this case indicates that the two edges of edge - class @xmath28 must be collapsed to a point before the bi - twist construction is engaged .",

    "first , subdivide each edge in the edge cycle @xmath16 into @xmath32 sub - edges .",

    "see  @xcite for an elementary exposition .",
    "a rational tangle is determined up to isotopy by a single rational number , which we call the rational number invariant of the tangle .",

    "because of this and milnor s result that @xmath46 is an @xmath207-manifold for @xmath208 , to prove that the groups @xmath137 are distinct , it suffices to prove that the groups @xmath137 are distinct for @xmath208 .",
