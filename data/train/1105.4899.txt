    "<S> a low energy effective field theory model for qcd with a scalar color octet field is discussed . </S>",

    "<S> the model suggests that the restoration of chiral symmetry and the deconfinement transition occur at the same temperature and that , near the transition , the critical exponent for the condensate is twice the gluon mass one . </S>",
    "<S> the model also favors the decoupling like solution for the gluon propagator .    ,    and    qcd , gluon mass , chiral symmetry breaking    the use of effective field theories is a common practice in physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are many examples in the literature of such type of approach for low energy hadronic physics from chiral perturbation theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) , to quark models with contact interactions and quark models including pions and meson fields ( see e.g.@xcite ) . in this work , we discuss an effective model , invariant under local @xmath1 color , for the non - perturbative regime of qcd which uses as degrees of freedom the gluon , the quark and a color octet scalar field @xmath2 . the scalar field can be viewed as multi - gluon and multi - quark excitation of the vacuum , i.e. it should be interpreted as a collective excitation of the qcd vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> given that the scalar field is not a color singlet , @xmath2 does not contribute directly to the s - matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar field resumes the non - perturbative properties of qcd and there is no need to specify in detail its dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 contribution to the quark and gluon dynamics comes via the color singlet condensate @xmath3 which , according to our estimates , turns out to be of the order of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar field generate a gluon mass @xmath5 , shifts the current quark mass and contributes to the quark condensate @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the shift in the quark mass and the quark condensate are all proportional to the effective gluon mass . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the model links the presence of an effective gluon mass with chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath7 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the studies of the phase diagram of qcd @xcite suggest that the restoration of chiral symmetry and the deconfinement phase transition occur at similar values for the temperature and chemical potential , at least for small enough values of the chemical potential @xmath8 mev . in the model under discussion </S>",
    "<S> either the gluon gets a dynamically generated mass , quarks are confined and chiral symmetry is broken or the gluon mass vanish , quarks become deconfined and chiral symmetry is restored . the model predicts that the restoration of chiral symmetry and deconfinement transition occur simultaneously at low baryon density , in close agreement with the study of the qcd phase - diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> some of the results obtained here can be tested comparing the predictions with non - perturbative solutions of qcd , namely with the results from schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) and lattice simulations . for pure gauge </S>",
    "<S> , the recent solutions of the sde can be classified into two classes . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling solution @xcite which predicts a vanishing gluon propagator at zero momenta and has no connection with a dynamical generated gluon mass . the decoupling solution @xcite which describes the gluon as a massive particle in the low energy regime , with the non - vanishing mass being related with gluon confinement . </S>",
    "<S> other authors have also contributed to the understanding of the solutions of the sde , see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two solutions agree in the ultraviolet region but differ significantly in the infrared region , with the decoupling solution being closer to the results of lattice qcd simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> lattice qcd simulations @xcite also suggest that the gluon behaves as a massive particle in the low energy regime and becomes massless in the high energy regime . </S>",
    "<S> a non - vanishing gluon mass is welcome to regularize infrared divergences and to solve unitarity problems . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a dynamically generated gluon mass is related with the presence of a @xmath9 gluon condensate . </S>",
    "<S> a non - vanishing gluon condensate is a clear sign of the non - perturbative sector of qcd - see , for example , @xcite and references therein . besides the theoretical support for a gluon mass , diffractive phenomena @xcite and inclusive radiative decays of @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite also suggest a massive gluon . </S>",
    "<S> the precise value for the gluon mass depends on the definition used to compute it . </S>",
    "<S> lattice qcd simulations and schwinger - dyson equations suggest an infrared gluon mass of @xmath12 mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenology points towards a gluon mass between @xmath13 gev and @xmath14 gev , depending on how the mass is defined ; see table 15 in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective model predicts a constituent light quark mass @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be tested looking at the ratio @xmath16 , as a function of momenta , using the decoupling solution of the sde . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison was performed using the results of @xcite , which rely on quenched lattice gluon and ghost propagators to solve the quark gap equation in the chiral limit . </S>",
    "<S> the decoupling solution depends on the ansatz used for the quark - gluon vertex . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the authors explore two different definitions for the quark - gluon vertex . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that , in both cases , the ratio of the constituent quark mass over the effective gluon mass squared is compatible with an essentially constant @xmath16 in the infrared region . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of our model get some support from the non - perturbative solution of the qcd schwinger - dyson equations .    in the formulation of the effective model </S>",
    "<S> we assume flavor independence to reduce the number of independent parameters . </S>",
    "<S> flavor independence of color interaction has phenomenological implications that have been checked experimentally at slac @xcite , measuring the strong coupling constant @xmath17 in @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that , within errors , @xmath17 is flavor independent . </S>",

    "<S> it is precisely the gluon sector which contains terms of third and fourth order in the gluon field @xmath23 . </S>",

    "<S> the vertices associated with the new interactions do not verify this property and can be viewed as mimicking the longitudinal part of the quark - gluon vertex , which is not constraint by slavnov - taylor identities . </S>",
    "<S> the effective model has phenomenological implications which have not been explored here and will be the subject of further publications . for example </S>",
    "<S> , the dressing of the quark - photon vertex due to @xmath2 can give rise to quark anomalous magnetic moments of the type discussed in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the model building blocks are the color octet field @xmath2 , the quark and the gluon fields . </S>",
    "<S> the hadronic matter is essentially quark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental situation for pure glue states is not so clear . </S>",
    "<S> one has to understand why there are no physical states than can be associated with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> an explanation could be its low mass and the weak couplings to the quarks . </S>",
    "<S> looking at the lagrangian , one can estimate the contribution of the new terms to the mass of @xmath2 as @xmath134 . for @xmath135 gev@xmath104 and @xmath136 </S>",
    "<S> , it follows that @xmath137 mev . </S>",
    "<S> curiously , recently the authors of @xcite have analyzed the babar bottomonium decay data and found an excess of signal which could be explained by a light scalar particle with a mass of 38 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the model , being a valid description for low energy qcd , predicts a behavior for the infrared gluon propagator which distinguish between the so - called scaling solutions and decoupling solutions of sde . </S>",
    "<S> the model is in close agreement with the decoupling like solution . </S>"
