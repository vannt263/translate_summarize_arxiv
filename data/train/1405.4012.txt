    "opacity quantifies photon absorption in matter and plays a crucial role in many high energy density ( he d ) plasmas , including inertial fusion plasmas and stellar interiors . modeling opacity is especially challenging when the plasma is composed of partially - ionized atoms with many bound electrons .",
    "first , one must accurately compute atomic data ( e.g. , energy level structures , photoionization cross - sections , and oscillator strengths ) ; then , atomic level populations have to be computed for the given conditions including a sufficiently - complete set of atomic levels ; and finally , line shapes and spectral formation must be taken into account in order to compute the frequency - dependent opacity .",
    "the complexity of such models makes experimental tests critical .",
    "however , the range of plasma conditions where opacity models are experimentally validated is extremely limited because opacity measurement requirements are also challenging .",
    "opacity measurements at he d conditions , such as those found in stellar interiors and inertial fusion ablators , are particularly rare@xcite .    without accurate opacity measurements ,",
    "the systematic uncertainties of modeled opacities are not known .",
    "this limits our understanding of plasmas and sometimes complicates the interpretation of plasma hydrostatic / hydrodynamic simulations when they disagree with measurements or observations . around 1980",
    ", it was reported that simulated cepheid variable stars could not reproduce the observed pulsations in certain regimes@xcite . in an attempt to resolve the discrepancies , various modifications to the cepheid models",
    "were tested , such as reducing mass , increasing helium abundance , and introducing magnetic fields .",
    "however , it turned out that the discrepancies were not caused by the cepheid models but mostly by inaccuracy of the calculated opacities used in the models .",
    "opacities re - computed using improved models were significantly larger at cepheid envelope conditions and resolved the discrepancies@xcite .",
    "calculating opacities is difficult , and this example illustrates the possible consequences of their inaccuracy .    more recently , calculated solar interior opacities , especially at the base of the solar convection zone ( cz ) , are in question@xcite .",
    "standard solar models ( i.e. , hydrostatic models ) were in excellent agreement with helioseismic measurements until the solar metal abundances were reduced in early 2000s @xcite .",
    "this lowered the abundances of c , n , o , ne , and ar by 35 - 45% , which lowered the calculated solar mixture opacities accordingly .",
    "the downward shift in the opacity altered the radiative heat transfer in the solar models , affecting their agreement with helioseismic measurements , especially at the cz base ( i.e. , @xmath5)@xcite .",
    "as with the cepheid variable problem , the inaccuracy of calculated opacity has been suggested as the origin of this cz problem ; a 10 - 30% increase in opacity would bring solar models and helioseismology into agreement@xcite .    until high - accuracy opacity measurements are conducted",
    ", opacity uncertainty will continue to be a potential explanation for many he d and astrophysical model - observation discrepancies .",
    "while a discrepancy often suggests how much the mean opacity should be increased ( or decreased ) , it does not provide anything conclusive on calculated opacity accuracy .",
    "are the discrepancies really caused by opacity inaccuracy ?",
    "exactly how are calculated opacities different from true opacities ? performing benchmark experiments",
    "measuring opacity is crucial to answer these questions and to guide potential opacity model refinements .",
    "such refinements would help to improve our understanding of the sun , many other stars , and a variety of other he d plasmas .",
    "opacity measurement techniques have been developed and refined over the past two decades@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , performing reliable experiments is demanding , and few high quality measurements exist .",
    "there are many sources of difficulty@xcite .",
    "first , one has to tailor the sample to the target conditions while also achieving sample uniformity , steady state , and local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "when transmission is measured through significant gradients , it is difficult to derive definitive conclusions on opacity .",
    "steady state and lte are common assumptions in opacity models , and thus have to be realized in the sample . to achieve lte , the experiment must either reach high densities or include a strong external radiation field that is reasonably close to equilibrium with the sample plasma , and these conditions must be maintained over a duration sufficient to establish steady - state ( i.e. , @xmath6 for each level population @xmath7 ) .",
    "second , once the sample is tailored to the target conditions , the sample transmission has to be accurately measured . to benchmark the detailed atomic and plasma physics in modern opacity models ,",
    "it is necessary to measure the frequency - resolved transmission .",
    "this requires a backlighter that is bright , to mitigate the sample self - emission effects on the emergent transmission spectra@xcite , and spectrally smooth , to avoid unnecessary complications due to instrumental broadening@xcite .",
    "reliable frequency - resolved opacity measurement also requires spectrometers with high resolving power to observe detailed bound - bound line features .",
    "these spectrometers must be free of any artifacts such as crystal defects and film scanning flaws that could result in disturbing the data .",
    "finally , the fe plasma conditions have to be independently measured to model the fe opacity and compare it with the measurement .    in 2007 , fe opacity experiments were performed to constrain the cz problem discussed earlier , and fe transmission spectra were successfully measured at charge state distributions similar to fe at the cz base for the first time@xcite .",
    "fe was studied for two reasons .",
    "first , fe is one of the biggest opacity contributors at the cz base .",
    "second , fe at the cz base has many bound electrons , making it more difficult to model than many other elements in the solar matter . uncertainty of modeled fe opacity may therefore be larger than the other elements .",
    "the fe samples were heated by the z - pinch dynamic hohlraum ( zpdh ) radiation source at the sandia national laboratories z - machine .",
    "the backlighter was provided by the stagnation of the zpdh implosion and was characterized as a smooth 314 ev blackbody radiator .",
    "this backlighter was bright enough to mitigate sample self - emission at the measured fe conditions .",
    "the fe reached an electron temperature , @xmath0 , of 156 ev and an electron density , @xmath8 , of 6.9@xmath910@xmath10 .",
    "the conditions were independently measured by k - shell transmission spectroscopy of mg mixed with the sample .",
    "fe l - shell transmission spectra computed from detailed opacity models were shown to match reasonably well with the measurements .    in order to benchmark fe opacity models at the cz base ,",
    "more experiments are needed .",
    "first , while the fe transmission spectra were measured at the charge state distribution similar to that of fe at the cz base , the inferred @xmath0 and @xmath8 were significantly lower than the conditions at the cz base ( i.e. , 185 ev and 9@xmath910@xmath11 ) .",
    "thus , fe opacity models need to be tested at higher @xmath0 and @xmath8 .",
    "this is important because additional effects become important as @xmath0 and @xmath8 increase . in lte",
    ", the same average ionization can be achieved by increasing both @xmath0 and @xmath8 . however , since population within each charge state is distributed following the boltzmann relation , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy difference between the excited and ground states , ions produced by higher @xmath0 and @xmath8 would produce more population in the excited states .",
    "this makes the accuracy of opacity calculations more sensitive to the accuracy of the atomic data of excited levels and to the treatment of highly - excited levels ( doubly , triply , .. , multiply excited levels ) . as density increases ,",
    "high density effects such as ionization potential depression and stark line broadening become more important . in particular ,",
    "stark line broadening in l - shell line transitions has not been explored as extensively as that of k - shell lines .",
    "furthermore , even detailed modern opacity models employ rather simple approximations similar to the formalism discussed in griem _ _ et al.__@xcite . in order to disentangle these physical details and benchmark opacity models",
    ", it is crucial to control the plasma conditions and repeat fe opacity experiments at several different @xmath0 and @xmath8 while maintaining similar charge state distributions .",
    "such a collection of measurements would promote investigations of how the effects of higher @xmath0 and @xmath8 gradually change the opacity and how well opacity models can predict them .",
    "it is also important to make direct measurements of the sample uniformity . in bailey _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite , the sample uniformity assertion was supported by the use of volumetric heating provided by zpdh radiation and by the fact that the mixed fe / mg transmission spectra were successfully modeled by a single @xmath0 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , it is preferable to experimentally quantify the level of the sample non - uniformity .    in this article",
    ", we describe measurements addressing three of the key requirements for opacity experiments : i ) control of the fe conditions , ii ) independent plasma diagnostics , and iii ) verification of the sample condition uniformity .",
    "the fe sample conditions can be controlled by the thickness of the tamping plastic ( @xmath14 ) as suggested by hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "thus , we performed fe opacity experiments with three different @xmath14 tamper thicknesses : i ) 10 @xmath15 m , ii ) 35 @xmath15 m , and iii ) 68 @xmath15 m",

    "these conditions nearly reproduced the charge state distribution of fe at the cz base , but with different levels of high temperature and density effects . also , one experiment was designed and performed to directly investigate the sample non - uniformity . for this particular experiment ,",
    "al was mixed into the side of the fe sample facing the radiation source and mg in the opposite side .",
