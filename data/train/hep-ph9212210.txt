    "the reported enhancement of strange particle production in heavy ion collisions relative to proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions @xcite tells us that we are dealing with a state of matter which is _ i ) _ very dense or _ ii ) _ relatively long - lived , or in which _ iii ) _ strangeness production cross sections are enhanced , or which _ iv ) _ possesses some combination of these three factors . in order to be able to be more specific about the nature of the dense matter , the relative production abundances of strange and multi - strange baryons and anti - baryons were studied .",
    "they turned out to be particularly sensitive probes of the thermal conditions of their source @xcite .",
    "studies of the properties of a hadron resonance gas fireball including strange particles have shown @xcite that the constraint of vanishing net strangeness of the emitting source leads to similar thermal and chemical conditions for both a hadronic gas ( hg ) and a deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) fireball , if the temperature is taken to be near @xmath0 mev .",
    "this value was extracted @xcite from the @xmath1-spectra from 200 geva s  w and s  pb collisions under the assumption that their slope is dominated by the thermal motion of the particles at freeze - out and does not contain a collective flow component @xcite . we will discuss that the observed smallness of the strange quark chemical potential appears to be inconsistent with the presence of a strong flow component in the spectra .",
    "it has already been pointed out @xcite that near @xmath2 mev further information , such as the particle multiplicity per participant nucleon , may help to distinguish qgp from the hg . following this route , we will show here in detail @xcite that the data of emulsion experiment emu05 @xcite indeed appear to be incompatible on these grounds with the hadronic gas fireball model .",
    "further support for a new physical state such as the quark - gluon plasma as the source of these anti - baryons may be obtained by studying the response of the measured parameters to changes in beam energy or size of the colliding nuclei .",
    "our work has been in part motivated by the imminent extension of the experimental program at cern and bnl to heavy nuclear projectiles ( pb and au , respectively ) , and by the prospect of higher ( and lower ) beam energies becoming available , in particular towards the end of the decade at brookhaven with rhic and possibly at cern with lhc . therefore , in addition to @xmath3 mev appropriate for the cern  sps energy range , we also include in our discussion the parameter range ( @xmath4 mev ) suitable for the current bnl heavy - ion experiments at 1015 geva and for potential future low beam energy runs at cern , as well as @xmath5 mev , which we judge appropriate for the future rhic and lhc facilities @xcite .",
    "our expectation is that , as the conditions of the experiments are changed , we will be able to study the response of the statistical parameters such as the strange quark chemical potential @xmath6 or the strangeness saturation factor @xmath7 .",
    "these parameters show characteristic differences in a hadron gas and a qgp : @xmath7 , for example , is expected to rapidly approach unity for increasing four - volume of the qgp fireball , while remaining small in hg fireballs @xcite .",
    "the strange quark chemical potential @xmath6 , on the other hand , has the characteristic property that it is exactly zero in a strangeness - zero qgp fireball , independent of its baryon density .",
    "in contrast to this , @xmath6 is generally different from zero in conventional hadronic gas reactions , except for the special case of baryon - free matter with @xmath8 ; however , if @xmath9 is not too large ( @xmath10 mev ) , for each value of the temperature a certain value of baryochemical potential @xmath11 can be found for which also @xmath12 .",
    "this value generally depends on the detailed form of the equation of state ( eos ) , and for the case of a conventional ( hagedorn type ) hg it has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . while the large values of @xmath7 which are characteristic of the fast chemical kinetics in a qgp are largely preserved during hadronization ,",
    "the value of @xmath6 is usually subject to modifications , in particular if the phase transformation occurs slowly .",
    "experimentally , the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are reflected in the observed strange hadron ratios ( where , as we will discuss , in the case of qgp certain model assumptions for the hadronization process are necessary in order to quantify this relationship ) , which allows for a rather straightforward experimental test of the fireball picture , of the concept of ( absolute or relative ) chemical equilibrium , and of the nature ( hg or qgp ) of the collision fireball .    in order to distinguish between the two phases by studying particle production as the conditions of the experiments",
    "are changed we need to understand also in the hg phase how the strange chemical potential @xmath6 relates to the baryochemical potential @xmath13 in the collision fireball .",
    "such a relationship is required by the fact that the total strangeness in the initial state is zero , and that strangeness is conserved by strong interactions .",
    "thus , up to ( presumably small ) pre - equilibrium emission effects which can introduce a small strangeness asymmetry @xmath14 , the number of strange and anti - strange quarks in the fireball are equal ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we work out in detail how the strange chemical potential is determined at fixed temperature by the baryochemical potential and a given ( small ) fraction @xmath16 of net strangeness in the fireball .",
    "we find that at a fireball temperature around @xmath17 mev , there is a peculiar behavior of @xmath6 which causes a particular insensitivity of the strange anti - baryon ratios alone to the structure of the source . in order to be able to reach a conclusion about the internal structure of the source",
    ", we then study the entropy content of the particle source .",
    "we also show that the kaon to hyperon ratio is a poor signature for the nature of the source , but could be a good measure of the baryochemical potential @xcite .",
    "the hg part of our work is similar in spirit , but different in detail from the parallel effort of cleymans and satz @xcite of the ( anti-)hyperon number , while we prefer to work directly with the strange quark chemical potential @xmath6 .",
    "the relationship between their @xmath18 and our @xmath6 is given by @xmath19.[foot1 ] ] .",
    "we study particle ratios at fixed transverse mass @xmath20 gev .",
    "we allow for the strangeness phase space to be only partially saturated and show how the degree of saturation @xmath7 can be experimentally measured in order to later serve as a test for the kinetic theory of strangeness production .",
    "we allow the strangeness to be slightly unbalanced ( up to 10% ) and discuss the corresponding variations in the observables .",
    "furthermore we compare the entropy content for the two different scenarios ( hg and qgp ) and confront the findings with the observed particle multiplicity .",
    "in particular we consider the ratio of net charge to total charged multiplicity , @xmath21 , which can be measured ( without identifying particles ) with any tracking device within a magnetic field ; we show that this ratio is directly related to the specific entropy @xmath22 of the fireball , which should be considerably larger for a qgp than for a hg @xcite . since , due to the different stopping , the experimental results from s  s and s  w collisions at 200 geva are not in the same class , we avoid combining these results because this would weaken the conclusions from our analysis .",
    "we do not combine in our analysis the global kaon data with anti - hyperon data , since low @xmath23 kaons , unlike strange anti - baryons , can also arise from peripheral , spectator related processes and other rescattering processes and are therefore not necessarily messengers from the same stages of the collision .",
    "instead we consider the @xmath24 and @xmath25 as well as @xmath26 and @xmath27 ratios which , as we will explain , provide independent tests of the degree of strangeness saturation  @xmath7 .    at this point",
    "it is worth recording that if a qgp state was formed ( as may be indicated by the relatively large value of @xmath7 , see below ) , the strangeness pair abundance per participating baryon in this state would be about a factor 2.5 larger compared to hadronic gas interactions . on the other hand , there would be a similar enhancement in the produced entropy ( which will manifest itself in the total multiplicity ) , resulting in a difficulty to identify the absolute enhancement of both quantities : the simplest observable , the @xmath28 ratio , is therefore not a very good discriminator in this context @xcite .",
    "as we will show , measurement of the specific entropy @xmath29 , either globally via the total particle multiplicity per participating nucleon , or ( better , see below ) in the same kinematic range where the produced strange particles are observed via the ratio @xmath30 , can remove this ambiguity .",
    "one of the important objectives we pursue is to present a large number of predictions for ( strange ) particle production which are capable to test the internal consistency of the model developed here and can shed new light on the problem of distinguishing the hg and qgp fireballs .",
    "these predictions are quantitative for the s ",
    "w collision system at 200  geva , but are of a more qualitative nature for the yet unexplored pb ",
    "pb collisions where we can not predict precisely the governing statistical parameters ( temperature , chemical potentials ) .",
    "we also discuss the systematic behavior of the different statistical model observables in changing environments .",
    "perhaps the most notable conclusion we reach concerns the model of hadronization of the fireball : we conclude that the only consistent model of the reaction involves explosive disintegration of a qgp as the source of the observed strange anti - baryons .",
    "this allows the chemical potentials of the quarks in the qgp phase to get transferred without modification to the observed high-@xmath31 strange baryons and anti - baryons , via quark coalescense , and explains naturally the observed vanishing of the strange chemical potential .",
    "since only high @xmath31 domain of strange anti - baryon spectra has been experimentally explored , the simple picture of a complete explosion is not absolutely necessary .",
    "it is conceivable that at low @xmath31 , in particular for low-@xmath32 pions , another slower hadronization mechanism also plays a role .",
    "we do see the need for some mechanism that produces additional pions , in excess over those obtained from the explosive quark coalescence picture , in order to save the entropy balance and to account for the relatively large observed multiplicity densities .",
    "these excess pions ( plus perhaps some other light mesons ) could easily arise from the gluons in the qgp which carry a large fraction of its entropy .",
    "a quantitative formulation of such a hadronization model , however , is not yet available and would require additional data on the detailed origin of the excess multiplicity and its distribution in momentum space .",
    "naturally , these conclusions rest on the assumed validity of the thermal fireball model .",
    "while at present the number of parameters just equals the number of independent observables , the model has considerable predictive power and , with the help of the predictions presented in this paper , its validity will be ( hopefully soon ) tested .",
    "other pictures for the source of the observed hadrons , such as an equilibrated hg or a qgp fireball which evolves slowly and in full equilibrium into a hg fireball , can not account consistently for certain important experimental features of strange anti - baryon production .",
    "in section [ sect2 ] we present our thermal model with special attention given to the parameters describing the chemical equilibrium .",
    "we take into account the @xmath33-@xmath34 asymmetry and study the condition of stangeness balance . in section [ sect3 ]",
    "we determine the thermodynamical parameters using the wa85 data on strange baryon and anti - baryon production ( with and without taking into account resonance decays ) . in section [ sect4 ]",
    "the implication of these parameters on the entropy content of the qgp and hg fireballs and on the multiplicity are discussed .",
    "we then confront our model with emu05 and na35 data . in section [ sect5 ]",
    "we discuss the implications of our results regarding the nature of the initial fireball and the dynamic of its evolution .",
    "we give some concluding remarks concerning the distinction we draw between qgp and hg .",
    "the use of thermal models to interpret data on particle abundances and spectra from nuclear collisions is motivated by the hope and expectation that in collisions between sufficiently large nuclei at sufficiently high energies a state of excited nuclear matter close to local thermodynamic equilibrium can be formed , allowing us to study the thermodynamics of qcd and the possible phase transition from a hg to a qgp at a critical energy density .",
    "since we do not yet reliably know how big the collision system and how large the beam energy has to be for this to occur ( if at all ) , thermal models should be considered as a phenomenological tool to test for such a behavior .",
    "even if successful , the validity of such an approach must be checked later by a more detailed theoretical analysis of the kinetic evolution of the collision fireball .",
    "it has been noted repeatedly that , especially in collisions involving heavy nuclear targets , the observed particle spectra , after correcting for resonance decay effects @xcite , resemble thermal distributions with a common temperature @xmath9 ( although a flow component can not presently be excluded and is actually quite likely @xcite ) , and that so far the interpretation in terms of a generalized thermal model , which assumes equilibration only of the momentum distributions and the light quark abundances , but allows for deviations in particle abundances from _ absolute chemical _ equilibrium , in particular in the strange sector , appears to be consistent with the observed particle ratios @xcite . in this section",
    "we will discuss this model as far as it is relevant for our analysis .",
    "let us assume that in collisions between two nuclei a region with nearly thermal equilibrium conditions is formed near `` central '' rapidity , _",
    "i.e. _ at rest in the center of momentum frame of the projectile and a target tube with the diameter of the projectile .    this central fireball from which the observed particles emerge is described by its temperature @xmath9 and by the chemical potentials @xmath35 of the different conserved quark flavors @xmath36 .",
    "since the conserved quantum numbers of hadrons are simply the sum of the corresponding quantum numbers of their quark constituents , the hadronic chemical potentials are given as the sum of constituent quark chemical potentials .",
    "since the strong and electromagnetic interactions do not mix quark flavors , @xmath37 and @xmath38 quarks are separately conserved on the time scale of hadronic collisions , and they can only be produced ( or annihilated ) in pairs : @xmath39 .",
    "this implies that in _ absolute chemical equilibrium _",
    "the chemical potentials for particle and anti - particle flavors are opposite to each other .",
    "this observation can be restated in terms of the particle fugacities which are convenient for counting particles and are related to the chemical potentials by : @xmath40 since the quantum numbers of a hadron are simply the sum of the corresponding quantum numbers of their constituent quarks , the fugacity of each hg species is simply the product of the quark fugacities , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath41 , etc .",
    "consequently the relation between particle and anti - particle fugacity is in general : @xmath42    if absolute equilibrium is not reached , this relationship can still be maintained by introducing an additional parameter characterizing the approach to equilibrium . for strange particles ,",
    "specifically , absolute chemical equilibrium is not easy to obtain : due to the higher mass threshold , the production of @xmath43 pairs usually proceeds much more slowly than that of @xmath44 and @xmath45 pairs .",
    "this is true both in hadronic interactions and in the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "in fact , the @xmath46 equilibration time scale is estimated to be of the same order of magnitude as the total lifetime of the collision fireball in the qgp phase @xcite , and much longer than that in the hadronic phase @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , once a certain number of strange - anti - strange pairs has been created in such a hadron gas , their redistribution among the various strange hadronic species is no longer hindered by any thresholds and occurs relatively fast .",
    "it thus makes sense to introduce the concept of _ relative chemical equilibrium _ , in which the strange phase space is not fully saturated , but whatever strangeness has already been created is distributed among the available strange hadron channels according to the law of maximum entropy . parametrizing the approach to strange phase space saturation by a factor @xmath47 ,",
    "the individual hadron fugacities are then given by @xmath48 where the @xmath49 still satisfy the chemical equilibrium condition ( [ lam ] ) , and where the power @xmath50 counts the total number of strange valence quarks _ plus _ anti - quarks in hadron species @xmath51 .",
    "altogether , within the thermal model the fireball is thus described by 5 parameters : its temperature @xmath9 , its baryon chemical potential @xmath52 the strangeness chemical potential @xmath6 , the light quark asymmetry potential @xmath53 ( see subsection  [ 2.1 ] ) and the strangeness saturation factor @xmath7 .",
    "the value of the temperature can be extracted from the observed transverse momentum spectra whose exponential slope is governed by a combination of thermal motion and collective expansion of the fireball @xcite .",
    "the separation of these two contributions , _",
    "i.e. _ the isolation of @xmath9 , is not straightforward , but has been studied extensively in @xcite .",
    "given @xmath9 , the number of independent variables is further reduced by studying the @xmath33@xmath34 asymmetry in the fireball and relating it to the asymmetry potential @xmath53 , and by the condition of strangeness conservation .",
    "this leaves us with two independent variables , say @xmath13 and @xmath7 , which have to be determined from measured particle ratios .",
    "the various parameters described above enter the thermodynamic description through the partition function from which all observables are derived .",
    "for the hadronic gas state we follow here the conventional hadronic gas model first developed by hagedorn @xcite in which the equation of state of any hadronic system is obtained from a partition function which sums over all hadronic resonances .",
    "it is believed that by including a complete set of intermediate scattering states in the form of ( usually zero - width ) hadronic resonances the dominant interactions within the hadronic system are automatically taken into account .",
    "however , an important but tacit approximation is made in this approach , concerning the parameters such as mass ( and sometimes widths ) of the resonances which are inserted with their free space values .",
    "this neglects the possibility that in particular at high temperature and particle or baryon density , there may occur significant shifts from the free space values ",
    "one often speaks in this context of the melting of hadronic masses as one approaches extreme conditions .",
    "while we do our computations entirely within the conservative framework of the conventional model , our general physics discussion will be shaped in such a way that our conclusions should not critically depend on the exact validity of the model used .",
    "the standard hadronic gas model is certainly not sufficiently precise for our purpose if we were to ask questions concerning the absolute values of energy , entropy , baryon density , etc . which depend either on the ever increasing mass spectrum of particles or on the proper volume occupied by the particles @xcite .",
    "however , the condition of zero strangeness and quantities such as the entropy per baryon , which involve ratios of extensive variables , are independent of the absolute normalization of the volume and of the renormalization introduced by the diverging particle spectrum and hence can safely be considered in our approach .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the constraints which limit the number of the free thermal parameters in the fireball .      in our calculations",
    "we will distinguish between the @xmath33 and @xmath34 quarks by introducing separate fugacities , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , instead of @xmath56 in the partition function .",
    "since even in the heaviest nuclei there is only a small @xmath33@xmath34 asymmetry due to the neutron excess , we find it convenient to work with the variables : @xmath57 here , @xmath58 is the `` light quark '' chemical potential ( @xmath59 in terms of the baryochemical potential ) and @xmath53 describes the asymmetry in the number of up and down quarks due to the neutron excess in the heavy ion collision .",
    "the ratio of the net number of down and up quarks in the fireball is @xmath60 in a central s ",
    "w collisions , where a tube with the transverse area of the s projectile is swept out from the w target and participates in the fireball @xmath61 ; in pb ",
    "pb collisions @xmath62 .",
    "the value of @xmath53 is at each fixed @xmath9 determined by the value of @xmath63 , but depends on the assumed structure of the source , _ i.e. _ the eos .",
    "we have investigated this relation for the two cases considered here : the conventional hg and the qgp .",
    "@xmath64    in the hg phase we include in the partition function all non - strange mesons up to a mass of 1690 mev , all nucleons up to 1675 mev and all @xmath65 s up to 1900 mev .",
    "[ we note that higher resonances would matter only if their number were divergent ( as is the case in the bootstrap approach of hagedorn @xcite ) and if the hg was sufficiently long lived to populate all high mass resonances ] .",
    "in addition strange hadrons are included as described in eq.([4a ] ) below , which we expand in calculations to allow to distinguish between @xmath33 and @xmath34 quarks within the various strange hadron multiplets .    in fig.[f1 ]",
    "we show how in the conventional hadron gas the difference @xmath66 induced by the isospin asymmetry of the fireball depends on the temperature , for two selected values @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( appropriate for s  w and pb  pb collisions , respectively ) , and for three fixed values of @xmath69 and 1.05 .",
    "@xmath64    @xmath64 the curves shown correspond to non - trivial solutions ( _ i.e. _ solutions with @xmath70 ) of the strangeness balance equation with the given values for @xmath71 ; as we will explain below , these solutions cease to exist ( since we require @xmath72 ) above a certain critical temperature , which is given by @xmath73 mev for @xmath74 and smaller ( larger ) for smaller ( larger ) values of @xmath71 .",
    "we see that , while for @xmath75 the ratio @xmath66 vanishes in the hadron gas , it is of the same order as the deviation from unity of @xmath63 once @xmath9 reaches values around 200 mev which are of interest here .    for the qgp",
    "the ratio @xmath66 is independent of @xmath71 , due to the decoupling of the strange and non - strange chemical potentials in the partition function . for @xmath76",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath77 such that @xmath66 is exactly equal to @xmath78 .",
    "it is remarkable that towards the maximum temperature consistent with strangeness conservation the hg and qgp based results for @xmath53 at a given @xmath63 nearly agree .",
    "we thus find that , although small , the difference between the chemical potentials of @xmath33 and @xmath34 quarks is not always negligible .",
    "we note for later applications that in the region of interest to us here ( @xmath79 mev ) we have irrespective of the nature of the fireball : @xmath80      in the boltzmann approximation , it is easy to write down the partition function for the strange particle fraction of the hadronic gas , @xmath81 , and we follow the notation of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , given the recently measured values of the thermal parameters ( which allow in particular for a rather high temperature @xmath79 mev ) it is necessary to sum over some more strange hadronic particles than was done in eq.([eq4 ] ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . including the possibility of only partially saturated strange phase space through the factor @xmath7 above , but neglecting for the moment the isospin asymmetry @xmath82",

    "the phase space factors @xmath88 of the various strange particles are : @xmath89 where the @xmath90 are the spin - isospin degeneracy factors , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the modified bessel function .    for the quark - gluon plasma ,",
    "on the other hand , the strange contribution to the partition function is much simpler , because the strange quarks and anti - quarks are isolated and do not occur in clusters with non - strange quarks as in the hadron gas : @xmath93\\ , .",
    "\\label{lnzs}\\ ] ] with the strange quark spin - color degeneracy factor @xmath94 for the value of the strange quark mass we take @xmath95 150180 mev ; in eq.([lnzs ] ) @xmath7 and @xmath71 do not factorize as has been the case for the hadron gas , because @xmath9 is of order @xmath96 and the boltzmann approximation is not always satisfactory and can produce errors of the order of 20% . recall that in general the strange particle density in a qgp is larger by a factor 25 than in a hg , due to the lower threshold ( @xmath97 ) and the presence of the color degeneracy factor in eq.([gs ] ) .",
    "we will now discuss the reduction of the number of free parameters caused by the condition of strangeness balance .",
    "since the net strangeness of the colliding nuclei in the initial state is zero , and strangeness is conserved by strong interactions , the net strangeness of the collision fireball will stay close to zero throughout the collision , except for corrections due to possible strangeness asymmetry in pre - equilibrium and asymmetric surface radiation of strange hadrons @xcite .",
    "if these processes can be neglected , the resulting condition of vanishing total strangeness takes the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the net strangeness density , @xmath100 with @xmath101 being the strangeness of particle species @xmath51 having density @xmath102 , and the sum going over all particle species @xmath51 existing in the respective phase ( qgp or hg ) .",
    "while for the qgp this relation leads always to the result @xmath103 or @xmath104 ( as one easily verifies by inserting eq.([lnzs ] ) ) , for the hadron gas it is an implicit equation relating @xmath71 to @xmath56 in a way which depends on the temperature @xmath9 @xcite .    in order to also be able to account for pre - equilibrium and surface emission fluctuations ,",
    "we introduce the net strangeness fraction @xmath105 and will also consider solutions for the analogue of eq.([eq6 ] ) , where the left hand side is given by @xmath106 . in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to asymmetries @xmath107 which might be accessible by purely statistical fluctuations caused by surface emission , without  strangeness distillation \" during qgp hadronization @xcite which arises when chemical equilibrium is enforced during a slow qgp hadronization process .",
    "an analysis of the phase diagram and the strangeness balance conditions for systems with very large net strangeness is presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we note briefly the practical consequences of @xmath108 : for the fireball created in central s ",
    "w collisions one has about 108 baryons in the interaction tube .",
    "if we consider a hadron gas with the thermal parameters ( without flow component ) as determined for these s  w collision data @xcite , we find a strange pair abundance of about 0.4 per baryon or about 40 strange pairs in total .",
    "the maximum asymmetry considered here in the hg phase at @xmath3 mev is thus about @xmath109 strange quarks .",
    "fluctuations of this magnitude are expected to occur in about half of the collision systems .",
    "since the vanishing of @xmath6 for all values of @xmath9 and @xmath13 in a strangeness neutral qgp appears to be such a unique feature of this state , it is interesting to ask to what extent this condition could arise in a hg .",
    "we will therefore first study the mechanisms which lead in a hg model to a small strange quark chemical potential in a restricted region of temperatures . of course , for a baryon - free system ( @xmath8 ) even in the hadron gas @xmath110",
    "is a natural consequence of strangeness neutrality . for systems with non - vanishing baryon number ( like the central rapidity fireballs created at ags and sps energies ) this is no longer true .",
    "we therefore ask ourselves under which conditions @xmath110 , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath103 , allows for non - zero values of @xmath111 to be consistent with strangeness neutrality .",
    "this question can be answered analytically : inserting the partition function ( [ 4a ] ) into the strangeness neutrality condition ( [ eq6 ] ) , we see that at @xmath103 the phase space for @xmath87 and @xmath112 cancels out , giving the exact result @xmath113 there is a real solution only when the argument on the right hand side is larger than unity .",
    "it turns out that this condition is a sensitive function of the temperature @xmath9 and of the hadronic resonances included ( and therefore of the masses of the resonances ) .",
    "in particular , for any given resonance mass spectrum used to compute the phase space factors @xmath88 , there is a temperature @xmath114 beyond which no such solution is possible  this occurs since @xmath115 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath9 ( see fig.1 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the case of exact strangeness neutrality ( @xmath116 ) in a hg in absolute chemical equilibrium ( @xmath117 ) was considered in @xcite , and for this choice of parameters our following theoretical analysis essentially agrees with that work .      an important aspect to consider is the value of @xmath6 observed and how it is compatible with the picture of the reaction .",
    "the reason that @xmath6 is of such importance is the expected value @xmath104 associated with qgp .",
    "we first will address the question under what circumstances this value is accessible to a hg fireball , and then turn to discuss more generally how different dynamical scenarios can be distinguished .",
    "we expect that there is a domain of temperatures for which even a considerable change of @xmath13 between @xmath118 and @xmath111 does not induce a significant change of @xmath6 .    for the extensive set of resonances included here",
    "this quite peculiar behavior occurs at @xmath119 mev for @xmath116 and at @xmath120 mev for @xmath121 . in figs.[f2]a , [ f2]b , [ f2]c we present the constraint between @xmath6 and @xmath13 at fixed @xmath122 mev ( solid curves ) , 150 mev ( long - dashed curves ) , 300 mev ( short - dashed curves ) and 1000 ( @xmath123 ) mev ( dotted curves ) for @xmath116 ( fig.[f2]a ) , @xmath124 ( fig.[f2]b ) , and @xmath125 ( fig.[f2]c ) , all for @xmath126 .",
    "the choice @xmath117 would not change our results significantly .",

    "specifically , for a stationary fireball one finds for the ratio of particles @xmath51 and @xmath135 , for each of which the invariant cross section is experimentally known at a certain rapidity @xmath136 in the region @xmath137 : @xmath138 here we used the identity @xmath139 for the particle energy ( with @xmath134 measured relative to the center of mass of the collision fireball ) to rewrite the transverse mass integral over the boltzmann distribution @xmath140 ( the factor @xmath141 results from starting with the lorentz - invariant cross section @xmath142 ) .",

    "qgp and hg states are easily distinguishable in the regime of values @xmath249 of interest here .",
    "the entropy per baryon in the hg is @xmath250 .",
    "consequently , the pion multiplicity which can be expected from such a hg fireball is at best @xmath251 .",
    "this is less than half of the qgp based expectation , which we can easily estimate by considering the perturbative qgp equation of state : up to corrections of order @xmath252 , the leading term of the specific entropy from light quarks and gluons is : @xmath253   \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\hspace{-0.6cm}= 17\\ , ( t/\\mu_q)\\quad \\mbox { for } \\alpha_s=0.6\\quad .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] adding to this the considerable entropy content of the strange quarks ( neglecting for technical reasons the @xmath254-corrections in this case ) , we find for the qgp a specific entropy of about 45 units at the same value of @xmath255 .",
    "poor knowledge of the value of @xmath254 and the strange quark mass in the qgp phase make this estimate uncertain by about @xmath256% .",
    "still , the difference to the hg result is considerable in terms of experimental sensitivity .",
    "checking the theoretical sensitivity we note that the point at which the entropy of hg and qgp coincide _ and _ strangeness vanishes _ and _ @xmath257 is at @xmath258 mev , @xmath259 mev , quite different from the region of interest here .",
    "we therefore consider now an observable which is capable to distinguish between the hg and qgp via their entropy content .",
    "total charged particle multiplicities ( excluding target / projectile fragments ) _ above _ 600 in the central region have been observed by emu05 @xcite in 200 geva s  pb collisions , corresponding possibly to a total particle multiplicity of as large as 1000 .",
    "we believe that such large multiplicities are implied by a qgp scenario for the central fireball , while being hardly compatible with the corresponding hg interpretation .",
    "the data of the emu05 collaboration @xcite were obtained with a high multiplicity `` trigger '' which makes them useful in comparison with the wa85 results which are also triggered on high multiplicity .",
    "some of these charged multiplicity data from emulsions are shown as a function of rapidity in fig.[f5 ] .",
    "we depict the quantity @xmath260 , the difference in the number of positively and negatively charged particles normalized by their sum @xcite : @xmath261    the data points correspond to 15 fully scanned  central \" events of 200 geva s  pb interactions , with the trigger requirement being a total charged multiplicity @xmath262 .",
    "reaction spectators ( target fragments ) are not observed in this experiment . at central rapidity",
    "a value of 0.080.09 is found for @xmath263 .",
    "we note the rise of @xmath263 in the projectile and target pseudorapidity regions , indicating a more rapid decrease of the particle multiplicity ( mostly pions ) than of the positive particle excess ( protons ) .",
    "obviously this feature proves the partial transparency at cern energies of the pb nucleus to the incoming sulphur projectile ; it will be quite interesting to see if this feature persists for heavier projectiles and in particular how the shape is in pb  pb collisions .",
    "@xmath64    [ f5 ]    [ f6 ]     +    [ f7 ]    @xmath64    in our theoretical work we address primarily the central region , in which the smallest values of @xmath263 indicate the highest multiplicity production .      the numerical evaluation of @xmath263 in a hg at @xmath264 , where we fix the temperature for each @xmath13 such that strangeness is conserved , is shown in fig.[f6 ] .",
    "we see that approximately @xmath265 this hg result is extremely simple , considering the complexity of the calculation .",
    "we thus see that in the only permissible hg scenario for the strangeness source which ( according to eq .",
    "( [ chempot ] ) ) _ has to have _",
    "@xmath266 gev , eq.([dq ] ) would predict a value of @xmath267 ; this is incompatible with the emu05 results , see fig.[f5 ] , where the central value is @xmath268 . at this value of @xmath263",
    "the hg phase would have @xmath269 mev , rather than the @xmath270 mev we have extracted from the strange baryon data . despite the fact that both measurements use different targets we believe that we can draw the conclusion that a hg fireball is incompatible with the combined emu05 and wa85 data .",
    "physically the variable @xmath263 represents essentially the inverse of the specific entropy .",
    "the measured very small value of @xmath263 thus implies a very large value for @xmath271 . in fig.[f7 ] we show the specific entropy as a function of @xmath272 for a zero - strangeness hadron gas at @xmath273 .",
    "we see the very strong direct correlation between these two quantities .",
    "we supplement this observation in figs.[f8]a , [ f8]b , and [ f8]c by also showing @xmath271 as a function of @xmath272 at fixed @xmath274 150 , 200 , 300 mev , varying @xmath275 . we observe that , within the range of these parameters , the small observed value of @xmath263 always requires a rather large specific entropy @xmath276",
    ". thus @xmath272 effectively measures the entropy per baryon , independent of the specific thermal conditions of the source .",
    "please note that in this connection it is essential to correctly account for the strange particles . to illustrate this point and to understand the value of @xmath263 we show in fig.[f9 ] the product @xmath277 as a function of @xmath13 for fixed @xmath278 ,",
    "where akin to fig.[f7 ] , the lower set of curves was obtained without strange particles .",
    "we see that strange particles have considerable impact on the result .",
    "both the limiting value and near constancy of the result obtained without strange particles can be easily understood since in this case @xmath277 is effectively the entropy per pion . to see this note that in absence of strange particles we have ( neglecting the small @xmath33@xmath34 asymmetry and assuming pion symmetry @xmath279 ) : @xmath280 where the last term in the denominator involves the sum over all initial charged particles other than pions , in particular heavy mesons , protons and anti - protons , etc . considering the product of @xmath263 with @xmath29 , the baryon content cancels and the result is effectively entropy per pion renormalized ( as it turns out numerically with a factor 2 ) by the degeneracy factors and resonance contributions .",
    "this also explains why the product is rather constant as @xmath13 ( and along with it @xmath9 ) changes : there is a slow increase in the entropy per pion with increasing @xmath13 since the resulting decrease in @xmath9 enhances the relative importance of the heavier baryon resonances with the associated larger entropy per particle .",
    "the question arises whether the qgp fireball model would be in better agreement with the combined wa85 and emu05 data , or if the disagreement of the hg picture with the data is rather an indication for the failure of the fireball model in general . in order to be able to answer this question in detail we need in principle to have a sophisticated model for the hadronization of a qgp .",
    "however , as long the final state is one with thermal momentum distributions , the relationship between @xmath263 and @xmath271 is likely to be similar to that of fig.[f7 ] even if the observed hadrons result from a hadronizing qgp .",
    "the reason is that the product @xmath281 ( in other words , the entropy per pion ) will not deviate drastically from its equilibrium hadron gas value even in a state which is considerably out of chemical equilibrium . noting that there is little entropy production in the qgp hadronization  process  @xcite  we  can    @xmath64     + @xmath64",
    "thus subsume that after hadronization the result would be a point close to the curve shown in fig.[f7 ] .",
    "we see that the value @xmath282 implies @xmath283 50 , which is indeed of the order required by a hadronizing qgp with the thermal parameters extracted in section 3 .",
    "we note that entropy per baryon is a dimensionless function of the dimensionless quantity @xmath284 and hence different qgp scenarios with the same @xmath284 all have the same value of the entropy per baryon .    as the result of this study",
    "we conclude that the charge flow ratio with the charged particle multiplicity is an excellent experimental measure of the entropy per baryon in the source , and that the current results are suggestive of a much more entropy - rich emitter at central rapidity than can be expected in hadronic gas models .",
    "@xmath64      even though the use of thermal model is less convincing for the small collision system s  s , we will shortly consider the results obtained by the na35 collaboration @xcite in s ",
    "s interactions at 200 geva . in this case",
    "we can base our discussion on the reported charged particle rapidity densities @xcite and the measured @xmath221 ratio @xcite .",
    "s  s interactions show at central rapidity visibly less baryon number stopping than s ",
    "w collisions ; from the data on @xmath285 and @xmath286 in @xcite we read off a central rapidity value of @xmath287 . the raw @xmath221 ratio ( uncorrected for @xmath86-decays )",
    "is strongly peaked at central rapidity and rises there to a value @xmath288 ( with error bars of order 50% ) @xcite . the observed transverse mass spectra can again be interpreted in terms of a thermal , longitudinally expanding central    [ f9 ]    @xmath64    fireball with @xmath289  200220  mev @xcite or , including a transverse flow component , by @xmath290 mev combined with a flow velocity @xmath291 @xcite .",
    "following eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) , the asymmetric @xmath292 ratio implies a non - zero combination of chemical potentials , @xmath293 .",
    "we note that the experimental ratio decreases when averaged over a larger rapidity interval , implying even larger chemical potentials .",
    "if @xmath294 mev , both the hg and qgp model imply @xmath295 for strangeness neutral systems , and we thus obtain @xmath296 mev . for the  flow \"",
    "scenario with @xmath183 mev , strangeness conservation in a hg allows the above relation to be satisfied with @xmath297 mev at @xmath298 mev , again with rather large experimental errors .    for the  thermal \" case we can use fig .  [ f6 ] to translate @xmath13 into @xmath263 ; with @xmath299",
    "mev we obtain @xmath300 . although the central value of @xmath263 extracted in this way is twice the measured value for this ratio , due to the large experimental uncertainty of the @xmath221 ratio the two numbers still agree within one standard deviation .",
    "we note that a hg with @xmath301 possesses a specific entropy @xmath22 = 35 , while @xmath263 = 0.065 requires @xmath22 = 6575 . for the  flow \"",
    "scenario , on the other hand , we compute with the conventional hg - eos ( with @xmath302 mev , @xmath303 mev ) a value @xmath304 , consistent with the measured value 0.065 .",
    "as this discussion demonstrates , the current na35 strange particle data are neither precise enough nor do they provide sufficiently complete information to allow for a similar analysis as done for the wa85 data above . in particular the lack of data on @xmath191 and @xmath305 production in s ",
    "s collisions prevents us from determining the values of @xmath7 and @xmath6 . in the absence of such information ,",
    "the validity of a hg description for the na35 s  s data can at the present moment not be excluded .",
    "so far we have extracted , with the help of thermodynamical concepts , from various sets of nuclear collision data the characteristic statistical properties of the source of the emitted particles . in the following",
    "we will comment on what our findings imply for the possible formation of a quark - gluon plasma , for its evolution and ultimately its dissociation into the final state hadrons .",
    "we have seen that a hg interpretation of the wa85 data on strange baryon production is not consistent with the large multiplicity densities observed by emu05 which indicate a much larger specific entropy than implied by the hg picture . in this context",
    "we have discussed both a  purely thermal \" interpretation of the data ( which identifies the slope of the transverse mass spectra directly as the fireball temperature ) and a  flow scenario \" , where part of the observed slope is due to a blueshift factor caused by transverse collective expansion of the fireball .",
    "independent of which version of the hg picture we used , we found from the wa85 data a surprisingly large degree of strangeness saturation @xmath7 , ranging from 75% in the purely ",
    "purely thermal \" interpretation to 90% in the  flow scenario \" .",
    "these are hard to understand in a hg scenario , because the time scale for strangeness producing processes is usually believed to be much too slow to achieve that kind of saturation during the lifetime of the collision , unless a qgp is formed .    within the hg picture ,",
    "the dynamical aspects connected with the flow seem to be required for consistency with the freeze - out kinetics @xcite .",
    "for this reason the  flow scenario \" has been highly favored before .",
    "however , we have shown here that within the hg picture the value @xmath110 constrains the liberty to interpret the slope of the transverse mass spectra in terms of a temperature which is blueshifted by flow .",
    "the observed values @xmath110 and @xmath306 are inconsistent with strangeness neutrality of the observed system of hadrons at the rather low value of @xmath307 mev resulting from the `` flow '' picture .",
    "to recover consistency with the strangeness neutrality of the fireball under these conditions , the hg equation of state would have to be very different from the conventional hagedorn resonance gas which we employed here .",
    "while such a major modification of the physics of the hadron phase can not at present be completely excluded , it would invalidate a large body of successful phenomenological work based on the conventional hg picture .",
    "thus , if the experimental result @xmath110 should be confirmed via other particle ratios , in our opinion it practically eliminates within the framework of a conventional hg - eos the flow interpretation of the spectra as a viable alternative to the purely  thermal \" interpretation .",
    "we therefore conclude that within a hg picture the interpretation of the @xmath1-slope of @xmath308 mev as the true temperature of the fireball appears to be the only possibility consistent with the constraint of ( approximate ) strangeness neutrality .",
    "this excludes the possibility of transverse flow , however , and thus causes consistency problems for the freeze - out process .",
    "in addition , it does not lead to the observed value of @xmath263 .",
    "therefore a hg interpretation of the data appears to be excluded .",
    "if one tries instead to interpret the observations in terms of qgp formation , one faces the problem to understand how the hadronization process can lead to a final state with the observed values for the thermodynamic parameters .",
    "we have seen that the conditions of strangeness neutrality and of a fixed up - down asymmetry in general lead , at the same temperature , to different values for the chemical potentials @xmath309 , @xmath310 , @xmath6 in the two phases . while a vanishing value of @xmath6 is a natural consequence of strangeness neutrality in the qgp , it is not at all natural in the hadron gas , where @xmath110 solves the strangeness neutrality condition only for very specific pairs of @xmath9 and @xmath13 , and thus in general it is not a value expected to arise in an interpretation of the experiments involving hg fireballs . on the other hand , while the values of the chemical potentials assumed in a hadron gas can be directly determined from the measured abundance ratios between the various hadronic species emitted by the gas , this is not automatically true for the qgp chemical potentials .",
    "how @xmath309 , @xmath310 , and @xmath6 inside the qgp are related to the abundance ratios of the finally observed hadrons depends on the dynamical and kinetic details of the hadronization process .    to illustrate this problem ,",
    "let us consider the limiting case of a very long - lived and slowly hadronizing quark - gluon plasma , where hadronization proceeds through a mixed phase providing intimate contact between the two sub - phases .",
    "in this case chemical equilibrium not only within the hadronic sub - phase ( with respect to processes which transform the hadrons among each other ) and within the quark sub - phase ( with respect to processes transforming quarks and gluons into each other ) , but also between the two phases ( with respect to processes which create hadrons out of quarks and gluons or dissociate them again into quarks and gluons ) can be maintained . as a consequence ,",
    "the chemical potentials change smoothly from their values originally assumed in the qgp phase into the chemical equilibrium values of the hadron gas , and only the latter ( and not the former ) would be observable by studying particle ratios .",
    "in such a scenario , the value of the strange quark chemical potential @xmath6 extracted from a suitable combination of strange hadron abundances @xcite would in general not be zero ( although it started out as zero in the original qgp phase ) , but would be given by the solution to the strangeness balance constraint ( [ eq6 ] ) in an equilibrated hadron gas .",
    "however , as demonstrated in this paper , the strange particle yields from the wa85 collaboration @xcite indeed do point to a value of @xmath110 , and in view of the naturalness of this value in the context of a qgp we are inclined to believe that this result may not be entirely accidental .",
    "therefore we ask under which conditions @xmath110 could have survived the qgp hadronization process after all .    one possibility to transfer the qgp values for the chemical potentials and temperature directly to the final state hadrons",
    "is to assume rapid break - up of the qgp combined with statistical quark recombination @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition for the preservation of the qgp thermodynamic parameters is that sequentially produced hadrons escape sufficiently rapidly such that there is no formation of a intermediate hg phase in which the chemical potentials and/or momentum distributions could re - equilibrate .",
    "one can view this process as the peeling of the qgp surface into the vacuum  since there is no barrier , the surface regions of the qgp fireball are peeled off in form of rapidly escaping hadrons , carrying in their abundances the information about the thermal and chemical properties of the qgp .",
    "one problem with such a picture is that the system of radiated hadrons , described by thermal distributions with chemical potentials and temperature as given originally in the qgp phase , by definition is characterized by the same particle abundance ratios and by the same value of the specific entropy as an equilibrium hg at the same temperature .",
    "the radiation obtained from this quark recombination picture is in general neither strangeness neutral , nor does it carry away the correct amount of entropy per baryon ( as fixed by the original qgp ) it is well known that the entropy balance can be saved by considering the entropy contained in the gluons of the qgp , letting them materialize as hadrons via gluon fragmentation into additional quark - anti - quark pairs . in @xcite the additional quarks from gluon fragmentation where hadronized according to the same laws of combinatorics as the thermal quarks from the qgp ; as a result the qgp chemical potentials were not preserved , but the quark chemical potentials were modified during hadronization in the direction of their hg equilibrium values .",
    "the minimal dynamical picture could consist of a primordial explosive production of the few high @xmath1 strange anti - baryons , followed by equilibrium hadronization of the remaining fireball at nearly constant entropy . to test such a picture requires the simultaneous measurement of the abundances and momentum spectra of ( strange and non - strange ) baryons and anti - baryons and of ( fully identified ) pions and kaons . only with such a complete set of data on produced hadrons",
    "can a full understanding of the evolution of the primordial dense phase ( qgp ? ) be achieved .",
    "of course , our contention that the presently available data are inconsistent with a hg picture for the collision and rather point to a very entropy - rich source of particle emission , possibly a quark - gluon plasma , must appear provocative at the present stage .",
    "our findings show that it is necessary to widen the investigation of strange anti - baryon ratios to higher _ and _ lower nuclear beam energies and to study simultaneously the particle multiplicity and charge flow at high and low @xmath1 , in order to confirm the now very suggestive conclusion of qgp formation in the collisions of s ions at 200 gev a with heavy nuclear targets at near zero impact parameter . in view of the ambiguity between the hg and qgp picture , as far as the consistency of a vanishing strange quark chemical potential with the condition of strangeness neutrality is concerned , the presently available beam energies at cern turn out to be somewhat unfortunate , due to the observed particular value of around 210 mev for the @xmath31-slope ; this ambiguity could be easily resolved if @xmath104 were still observed in cases where the @xmath31-slope ( apparent temperature ) is lower or higher .",
    "it is natural to expect such a variation in the slope parameters ( combined by an inverse variation of the baryon chemical potential ) once collisions at lower or higher beam energies are studied ( for example with a 50 gev a pb - beam at the cern sps or with 100 + 100 gev a au - beams at rhic ) .",
    "we are also looking forward with anticipation to the forthcoming pb  pb collisions at about 170 gev a projectile energy , which will allow to check and extend the results of our analysis by going to the largest possible thermodynamic systems using nuclear collisions .",
