    "<S> a relevant point when dealing with finite systems is that actually neither the size of the bath is important ( only matters in limiting the recurrence time ) nor the local density of modes has any significant influence on memory effects .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , unexpected results have been found when increasing temperature leading to opposite behavior inside and outside the band with a ( linear in t ) nm increase in the band - gap while inside the band memory effects become negligible for temperatures larger than the environment frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> finally we have quantified nm when departing from the ohmic case , considering positive and negative algebraic spectral densities @xmath103 for @xmath104 ( being @xmath105 a recently measured value @xcite ) showing an enhancement of memory effects for both positive and negative values of @xmath96 , with the ohmic case ( s=1 ) not being necessarily the most markovian one .    financial support from micinn , mineco , csic , eu commission and feder funding under grants fis2007 - 60327 ( fisicos ) , fis2011 - 23526 ( tiqs ) , post - doctoral jae program and cost action mp1209 is acknowledged .    10    u. weiss , _ quantum dissipative systems _ world scientific publishing , 2008 ) ; h .- </S>",
