    "after dirac proposed the theory of negative energy solutions of his equation @xcite , it was realized that photons can interact with other photons by polarizing the vacuum .",
    "photon - photon scattering was qualitatively considered in this context by halpern @xcite , and its cross section , for the case of photon energies low compared to the electron mass , was determined by euler and kockel in 1935 @xcite . if the energy of each of the colliding photons is @xmath2 in the frame in which their total momentum vanishes , the low - energy differential cross section is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the fine structure constant and @xmath5 is the electron mass .",
    "high energy scattering was considered soon afterward @xcite . a thorough analysis of the scattering at all energies , including partial cross sections for various polarization states ,",
    "was carried out in @xcite , using the then new diagrammatic technique of feynman . since then",
    ", the photon - photon scattering cross section has been confirmed with other methods , and even higher - order qed corrections have been computed @xcite .",
    "results obtained up to 1971 are reviewed in @xcite and more recent developments are summarized in @xcite .    very recently , the classic result for the low - energy cross section ( [ eq : correctcross ] ) has been questioned @xcite . in those papers , the cross section is found to be many orders of magnitude larger , since it is not suppressed by powers of @xmath6 , but is proportional to @xmath7,@xmath8 as we will demonstrate in this paper , this claim is incorrect .",
    "it has already been pointed out @xcite that it contradicts existing laboratory bounds on the the photon - photon cross section , obtained by colliding laser beams .",
    "we show in addition that a cross section increasing with the inverse squared energy of the colliding photons limits the mean free path of visible light due to collisions with the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) to less than the distance between earth and jupiter .",
    "thus the fact that we can sharply see much more distant astronomical objects proves that the low - energy photon - photon scattering must be significantly suppressed , as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : correctcross ] ) .    the matrix element for the photon - photon scattering is absent at the tree level since photons are neutral .",
    "it arises only at the loop level .",
    "the sum of all contributing loop diagrams must be finite since there is no parameter in the qed lagrangian whose renormalization could absorb a divergence . refs .",
    "@xcite found an incorrect result because of the assumption that if the sum of those diagrams is finite , they can be calculated without any regularization . in fact , even though the sum of the diagrams is finite , each of them separately is divergent . calculating the sum is somewhat delicate and is easiest done with regularized loop integrals ( see , however , an alternative calculation in @xcite and another point of view on avoiding regularization in @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , a similar error @xcite has recently cast doubt over the rate of the higgs boson decay into two photons .",
    "that process , too , is loop induced , and the sum of contributing loops is finite .",
    "but individual loop integrals are divergent and must be regularized , as has already been thoroughly discussed in this context @xcite .",
    "the cmbr is a gas of photons with the spectrum of a black body at a temperature of @xmath9 k. here we want to compute how far a visible - light photon with energy @xmath10 ev can travel in such a gas before scattering , from the point of view of an observer in whose frame the cmbr is isotropic .",

    "an earth - based observer is a good approximation . )",
    "consider one mode of the cmbr radiation , characterized by its energy @xmath11 and inclination angle @xmath12 with respect to the direction from which the visible photon is incident .",
    "the relative velocity of the two photons ( as seen in the lab frame ) is @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( we use the units @xmath15 ) . in the frame where the total momentum of the photons vanishes , each has the energy @xmath2 given by@xmath16 that energy determines the scattering cross section .",
    "collisions with photons in this particular mode will occur at the rate@xmath17 where @xmath18 is the density of cmbr photons with energy @xmath11 , and @xmath19 is the scattering cross section . integrating over the energies and directions of the cmbr photons we find the mean free path . between collisions ,",
    "the visible - light photon will travel on average the distance @xmath20^{-1}.\\label{eq : meanfreepath}\\ ] ] we now consider the two formulas for the low - energy cross section . if we use the classical result ( [ eq : correctcross ] ) , we find the total cross section@xmath21 and the mean free path@xmath22^{-1}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\pi^{2}\\left[\\frac{973\\alpha^{4}e_{\\gamma}^{3}}{10125\\pi m^{8}}\\cdot\\frac{4}{9}\\cdot\\frac{8\\pi^{6}}{63\\beta^{6}}\\right]^{-1}=\\frac{820125m^{8}\\beta^{6}}{4448\\pi^{3}\\alpha^{4}e_{\\gamma}^{3}}.\\label{eq : freepathclassic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath23 mev we find @xmath24 meters , a distance that would take light about @xmath25 times more time to travel than the age of the universe . in other words ,",
    "the cmbr is a rather transparent medium at visible frequencies .",
    "however , if we take instead the cross section suggested in @xcite , we find from eq .",
    "@xmath26 which gives a much shorter mean free path ,    @xmath27^{-1}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\pi^{2}\\left[\\frac{29\\alpha^{4}}{540\\pi e_{\\gamma}}\\cdot4\\cdot\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6\\beta^{2}}\\right]^{-1}=\\frac{810\\pi\\beta^{2}e_{\\gamma}}{29\\alpha^{4}},\\label{eq : freepathfk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    or @xmath28 meters , equivalent to about 15 light minutes . for comparison , the orbital radius of jupiter is about @xmath29 meters . if the mean free path of the visible light were so much shorter than even the radius of jupiter s orbit , no stars would be visible on the night sky . clearly , the result eq .",
    "is at odds with experience .",
    "the situation with eq .",
    "is actually even worse .",
    "since the cross section is not suppressed by the mass of the electron , there would be additional positive contributions from other charged fermions that would differ only by the coupling constant , and would further decrease the mean free path .",
    "this lack of suppression by the inverse mass of the loop particle contradicts the appelquist - carazzone decoupling theorem @xcite .",
    "in this section we present a derivation of the photon - photon scattering matrix element in two regularization schemes : dimensional and pauli - villars .",
    "we consider the box diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : virtual - electron - loop ] .",
    "external photons carry momenta @xmath30 which we will consider as incoming , @xmath31 .    ]",
    "there are six ways in which the four momenta can be arranged around the oriented electron loop .",
    "however , diagrams that differ only by the direction of the electron line give identical results so it is enough to compute three of them , corresponding to three cyclic permutations of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "( if there was an odd number of photons coupling to the electron loop , the diagrams differing by the direction of the electron would cancel one other , resulting in a vanishing amplitude .",
    "this is the theorem due to furry @xcite . )    at low energies of external photons it is especially easy to compute the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : virtual - electron - loop ] .",
    "we simply taylor - expand the electron propagators in the external momenta , so that each propagator s denominator becomes simply @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the loop momentum .",
    "such expansion does not lead to any spurious divergences , and commutes with the integration over @xmath35 .",
    "we now explain how this integration is performed in two regularization schemes .",
    "now that @xmath35 is present in the denominators only through @xmath36 , also in the numerator we can replace all scalar products of @xmath35 with other vectors by powers of @xmath36 times products not involving @xmath35,@xmath37 here @xmath38 is the space - time dimension and @xmath39 is a sum of products of @xmath40 metric tensors @xmath41 , totally symmetric in all indices @xmath42 ; it has @xmath43 terms .",
    "terms odd in @xmath35 vanish upon integration .",
    "the powers of @xmath36 resulting from can be canceled against the denominators and the loop integration can be completed using@xmath44 each of the three diagrams contains terms with the exponent @xmath45 , leading to a divergence @xmath46 .",
    "the divergences cancel when we add all three contributions .",
    "but individual diagrams containing singularities @xmath47 have also @xmath38-dependent factors , arising from the averaging in eq . .",
    "the resulting finite contributions _ do not _ cancel among themselves .",
    "how do these remaining terms depend on @xmath5 ?",
    "we remember that they arise from the @xmath45 sector , therefore they scale like @xmath48 ( the overall dimension of the @xmath0 amplitude ) .",
    "there are other terms that scale with this power , arising from convergent integrals like @xmath49 .",
    "the essential point is that the sum of all @xmath48 terms , including the remnants of singularities , adds up to zero .",
    "the total result for the amplitude turns out to be suppressed by four powers of @xmath50 .",
    "another way of carrying out this calculation is to stay in four dimensions but add another amplitude , with the electron replaced by a very heavy particle of mass @xmath51 , and with an opposite sign than the electron loop .",
    "the calculation proceeds very similarly to the case of dimensional regularization , with two changes . in averaging over the loop momentum directions we replace @xmath52 by its value at @xmath53 , @xmath54",
    "the formula for the loop integration is also replaced by its @xmath53 value , except in the divergent case @xmath45 . in the dimensional regularization ,",
    "this divergent integral gives @xmath55 . in the pauli - villars approach one finds a convergent combination@xmath56=\\frac{i}{16\\pi^{2}}\\ln\\frac{m^{2}}{m^{2}}.\\label{eq : log}\\ ] ] when the three diagrams are added , this logarithm cancels , but now there are no finite remnants of the singularities .",
    "instead , the @xmath48 terms from the convergent diagrams are canceled by the @xmath57 terms from the pauli - villars subtraction . since they are independent of the electron mass , they are the same in the amplitudes with the electron and with the very heavy particle , and cancel in the difference .    in both regularization schemes , the only remaining result is suppressed by the electron mass .",
    "we have just seen that the regularization is crucial in computing the photon - photon scattering amplitude , even though the final result does not contain divergences .",
    "we now want to inspect more closely the part of the amplitude that does not contain external photon momenta , and thus scales like the zeroth power of the electron mass ,    @xmath58\\epsilon_{1\\mu}\\epsilon_{2\\nu}\\epsilon_{3\\rho}\\epsilon_{4\\sigma},\\label{eq : nopowerofm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath59    where the terms not shown in @xmath60 have the other five distributions of indices so that both @xmath61 and @xmath60 are totally symmetric in @xmath62 .",
    "the second line in contains four powers of the loop momentum @xmath35 and thus represents divergent integrals . without regularization ,",
    "these divergent integralssimply do not have a meaning .",
    "if we apply the averaging procedure to these terms , we find @xmath63 so that if @xmath53 , the second line of vanishes , as does the term @xmath64 in its first line . thus , if the regularization is neglected , one is left with only the first term @xmath65 which , after the @xmath35 integration , gives a result independent of the electron mass , scaling like @xmath48,@xmath66 where @xmath67 are the polarization vectors of the four photons .",
    "this dependence of the amplitude only on the polarization vectors ( and not on the photon momenta ) means that the induced coupling of the photons involves only their vector potential ( the induced effective operator is proportional to @xmath68 ) , and not its derivatives .",
    "it is not possible to construct such a coupling in a gauge invariant way .",
    "this violation of gauge invariance may also generate photon s mass .",
    "for example , if two of the external photon lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : virtual - electron - loop ] are contracted , the resulting two - loop diagram generates an operator @xmath69 , thus giving the photon a mass .    in order to see how the cross section in eq",
    ".   follows from the amplitude , we define two transverse polarization vectors for each photon , @xmath70 , with @xmath71 perpendicular to the scattering plane and @xmath72 lying in that plane .",
    "we do not include here the longitudinal photon polarizations , present if the photon becomes massive , even though they may dominate the cross section ; however , our goal here is merely to explain how the result is related to the gauge - invariance violating amplitude . for the eq . to give a non - zero result",
    ", each polarization must be represented an even number of times ( otherwise there will always be a factor 0 in every term ) .",
    "there are eight possible such polarization assignments , giving the following values of the three terms in , @xmath73 and the last three amplitudes enter with a weight factor of 2 , due to the symmetry @xmath74 .",
    "the various amplitudes differ by the polarization of some photons , so they do not interfere .",
    "the sum of their squares gives @xmath75 , the angular structure of the ( incorrect ) result quoted in . in fact , a sum over the polarizations of the final state photons and an average over the polarizations of the initial state photons , leads to the cross section given in eq . .    what went wrong in the above procedure ?",
    "the formulas can not be applied to the divergent integrals in the second line of in @xmath53 , without regularization .",
    "if we stay in @xmath38 dimensions , the terms we found to be zero in the @xmath76 limit given finite contributions that cancel against the first term of the integrand , @xmath77 .",
    "in this correct treatment the resulting amplitude is suppressed by four powers of @xmath50 .    the recent incorrect claim about the decay @xmath78 @xcite originated with a similar , but somewhat simpler integral .",
    "an example of a contribution to that process is shown in fig .  .",
    "there are only three propagators , and the divergent integrals are present in the combination @xcite@xmath79 without dimensional regularization , if we take @xmath53 , it seems that this integral vanishes after averaging over @xmath35 with help of . as we have seen with the example of @xmath1 scattering , and as has already been discussed in the literature @xcite , such manipulations with unregulated , divergent integrals are unjustified . in the case of the higgs decay , they lead to the incorrect conclusion that @xmath80 vanishes .",
    "in fact , in the limit of a very heavy higgs boson , the correct finite result of @xmath81 gives the most important contribution .",
    "boson loop mediating the higgs boson decay into two photons .",
    "[ fig : virtual - electron - loop-1 ] ]      the correct result of the loop integration in the @xmath0 amplitude contains scalar products among photon momenta @xmath82 , in addition to the polarization vectors @xmath83 .",
    "the effective photon - photon coupling induced in this way is described by operators involving the electromagnetic field tensor and is gauge invariant .",
    "we know calculate the scattering cross sections for various polarization situations . instead of the linear polarizations we have just considered",
    ", the scattering amplitudes will be presented in terms of circular polarization states .",
    "thus we introduce@xmath84 describing right- and left - handed polarization states , respectively .",
    "there are four possible initial polarization states , but it is sufficient to consider just two of them , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we get three independent scattering amplitudes , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "we describe kinematics in terms of mandelstam variables @xmath90 and @xmath91 and find    @xmath92    we note that the amplitude @xmath88 vanishes at the leading order in @xmath93 expansion at which the other amplitudes are finite . in order to compute it",
    ", we have to evaluate two more terms in the taylor expansion",
    ".    all other amplitudes can be obtained from eq . using space and/or time reversal and the crossing symmetry .",
    "for example , @xmath94 and @xmath95      once the polarized amplitudes have been evaluated , the unpolarized cross section can be easily found .",
    "we quote here only the leading low - energy result ( thus we neglect @xmath88 and seven amplitudes related to it ) for the cross section averaged over initial and summed over final polarizations,@xmath96 in agreement with the classic result .",
    "when integrated over both @xmath12 and @xmath97 from 0 to @xmath98 ( we integrate only over one hemisphere since the two final - state photons are identical ) , this gives the total photon - photon scattering cross section , @xmath99 in agreement with @xcite .",
    "other texts seem to have misprints in these results @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the recently claimed result for the @xmath0 scattering cross - section must be wrong .",
    "the photon - photon coupling is induced by virtual loops with charged particles and is suppressed at low photon energy by the inverse power of the electron mass .",
    "the result lacks this suppression and yields a very large cross - section , therefore a short mean free path of visible photons even in the rare cosmic microwave radiation background .",
    "such short path would obscure all astronomical objects as close as jupiter .",
    "we have showed that the error resulted from manipulating unregulated divergent integrals .",
    "a similar error misled the authors of @xcite in the context of the higgs decay to two photons .",
    "both processes arise only at the loop level and their amplitudes must be finite , since there are no parameters in the lagrangian that could absorb a divergence .",
    "however , both processes are usually computed from a sum of several diagrams , among which some are divergent . for this reason ,",
    "a regularization of individual contributions is necessary .",
    "interestingly , the mistakes in these recent studies of @xmath0 and @xmath78 led to confusions about various types of decoupling . the correct result for the former process does respect appelquist - carazzone decoupling theorem in the limit of low photon energies or large electron mass , whereas the incorrect result of @xcite does not . on the other hand ,",
    "the correct result for the higgs decay does not vanish , as one could naively expect , in the limit of large higgs mass @xcite ( or , equivalently , low @xmath100 boson mass ; this type of decoupling affects for example quarks but not the longitudinal @xmath100 components ) , while part of the reason why @xcite believed their result was that it did vanish in that limit .",
    "we have also showed how the @xmath0 amplitude can be calculated in the low - energy regime , and how an expansion in powers of the photon energy to the electron mass ratio can be organized .",
    "this tutorial illustrates useful techniques of loop calculations : averaging over loop momentum direction , loop momentum integration , and various regularizations .",
    "we hope it will be helpful for other similar loop calculations .",
