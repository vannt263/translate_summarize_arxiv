    "since the individual light curves are too noisy for a direct comparison , we have to combine many data points and analyse their moments .",
    "let us define @xmath17 , the @xmath18-th light curve moment of each individual transit as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the times and occulted fluxes belonging to each data points , @xmath22 is the transit duration and @xmath23 is the calculated mid - time of the transit , based on the ephemeris in borucki 2011 .",

    "[ fig : zetabeta ] , onto the distribution of the reciprocal transit length ( which is the actual output of the light curve fit algorithm ) .",
    "we now describe the details of how the light curves were analyzed .    first , every transit was fitted independently using the analytic models of @xcite .",
    "this fit invokes symmetric templates which can not fit the known asymmetry of the light curves ; but since the asymmetry appears similarly in each transits , we expect no time - dependent bias in the results .",
    "the free model parameters are : the transit time , the relative radius of the planet , the reciprocal of the half duration , @xmath25 , and the square of the impact parameter , @xmath26 .",
    "these parameters are almost uncorrelated to each other ( pl 2008 ) .",
    "indeed , our analysis shows that the inverse duration @xmath25 follows a secular trend ( see fig .",
    "the derived values of these parameters are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : zetabeta ] . that the decrease in @xmath25 , indicating a lengthening of the transit duration , is due to the increasing orbital inclination ( i.e. due to decreasing impact parameter ) .",
    "the observed linear trend in @xmath25 is @xmath27 . since the relation between @xmath25 , @xmath28 and @xmath26 is @xmath29",

    "* ) , we can compute the time derivative of @xmath30 as @xmath31 this was obtained by re - ordering equation  ( [ eq : arzeta ] ) and assuming that @xmath28 is constant . by substituting our best - fit @xmath32 into this equation",

    "as known from the theory of satellite motions @xcite , higher order moments of the gravitational potential of a host body yield periodic and secular perturbations in the orbits of nearby companions .",
    "the external gravitational potential of an extended body can be expressed as @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the total mass , @xmath37 is the equatorial radius , @xmath38 are constants and @xmath39 are the legendre polynomials .",
    "the most prominent perturbation is caused by @xmath40 , due to the oblateness of the host body .",
    "maccullagh s theorem allows us compute @xmath40 using @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the principal moments of inertia .",
    "it is known that a non - zero @xmath40 results in secular perturbations in the angular orbital elements .",
    "namely , the secular term in @xmath43 ( argument of ascending node ) is computed as @xmath44 here @xmath18 denotes the orbital mean motion , @xmath45 is the semi - major axis and @xmath46 is the orbital eccentricity .",
    "it is known from vector geometry , that if an unit vector @xmath47 precesses around the unit vector @xmath48 with an angular frequency of @xmath49 , the time derivative of @xmath47 will be @xmath50 in our case , @xmath47 is the unit vector parallel to the orbital angular momentum of the transiting body . since the components of @xmath47 are @xmath51 and the only observable quantity is @xmath52 , we can write @xmath53 by substituting @xmath54 and @xmath55 and the components @xmath56 and @xmath57 from equation  ( [ eq : ncomponents ] ) , we obtain @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the ascending node of the stellar equator , and @xmath60 is the longitude of the planet s ascending node , relative to that of the ascending node of the stellar equator by definition .      assuming a circular orbit for the transiting companion and substituting the above relation and equation  ( [ eq : cosmutuali ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : j2omega ] ) , and by taking @xmath61 as the precession rate inducted by @xmath40 , we finally obtain @xmath62 since transits are observed , we can say here that @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , @xmath64 , thus the above equation can be rearranged to give @xmath65 as @xmath66 for @xmath40 we obtain @xmath67 substituting the derived stellar parameters we find @xmath68 , and @xmath69/day .",
    "the distortion of a rotating star is @xmath70 @xcite , where @xmath37 and @xmath71 are the radii at the equator and the poles , respectively .",
    "thus , the expected value of @xmath40 is in the range suggested by the theory of secular perturbations , supporting our interpretation .",
    "with high - precision _ kepler _ photometry , we detected photometric and dynamical effects of stellar rotation in the exoplanet host koi-13 . from photometry alone , we have detected the following three phenomena for the first time :    * stellar rotation in a probable resonance with the orbital period of the close - in substellar companion ; * long - period transit duration variations ; and * precession of the orbital plane of an exoplanet candidate .",
    "variations in transit duration were found from the fit of the consecutive light curves to transit shape models .",
    "simultaneously , we fitted other model parameters such as the relative radius of the planet , the impact parameter and the timings of transits , and no variations were found in these quantities .",
    "the negative ttv detection is plausible because secular variations can be detected more easily in tdv than in transit timings for short time coverage @xcite .",
    "an argument against the reality of tdv can be that we fitted symmetrical templates to a transit with known slight asymmetry .",
    "however , we consider that the detected trend is not an artifact of this kind , because ( i ) there is no visible time - dependent trend in the asymmetric part of the light curves ; ( ii ) the errors contain the ambiguity introduced by the asymmetric part , while the detection is still significant , and ( iii ) it is rather unlikely that the varying asymmetries affect only the transit duration , and leave the other parameters unchanged .    in interpreting the cause of transit duration variations ,",
    "our hypothesis of secular @xmath40 perturbations is a probable scenario , but other processes can not be excluded ( e.g. perturbations from an unreported outer planet ; the presence of a moon around koi-13.01 ) .",
    "however , the stellar rotation is the most plausible reason for tdv , because it does not invoke other bodies into the explanation , and the inferred @xmath40 is fully compatible with the expected value . in other words",
    ", one would predict secular @xmath40 perturbations of koi-13.01 at the rate detected , taking into account the rapid rotation of the host star and the close proximity of its substellar companion .",
