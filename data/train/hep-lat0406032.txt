    "i.e. _ , only two species of light @xmath79 and @xmath80 quarks of the same mass and a single @xmath81 quark .",
    "the s@xmath3pt treats only the case in which quark multiplets come in multiples of four .",
    "absent a rigorous treatment of fractional powers in s@xmath3pt , we adopt the replica trick : assume that an analytic continuation in the flavor number @xmath74 reproduces the effect of taking a fractional power of the determinant .",
    "that is , we replace @xmath82 by 2 and @xmath83 by 1 in the expression above .",
    "the susceptibility for @xmath78 flavors is then @xmath84 of course , this result is valid only in leading order chiral perturbation theory , but at large quark mass it interpolates smoothly @xcite to the quenched result predicted for pure gauge theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath85 at small @xmath86 the susceptibility is dominated by the pion mass . without taste breaking we recover the conventional formula @xmath87 we see that the effect of taste breaking at leading order is simply to replace the masses of the goldstone mesons in the conventional expression with the masses of the corresponding taste - singlet non - goldstone states .",
    "the squared masses of these states vary linearly with quark mass and have a nonzero intercept .",
    "therefore , at nonzero lattice spacing , the topological susceptibility does not vanish at zero quark mass .",
    "however , in the continuum limit , the expected zero is recovered .",
    "the topological susceptibility has been determined recently for gauge configurations generated with an improved staggered fermion action@xcite .",
    "it was found that at nonzero lattice spacing the lattice susceptibility is higher than that predicted by chiral perturbation theory , but ( at least within the available statistical errors and an extrapolation based on limited data ) it is consistent with the continuum prediction .",
    "two principal causes for disagreement at nonzero lattice spacing were proposed : ( 1 ) dislocations in the gluon field could imitate small instantons and participate in screening of the topological charge . these and small instantons are erased in the smoothing ( cooling ) process , possibly leaving behind larger , unscreened instantons .",
    "the latter would then increase the smoothed susceptibility .",
    "( 2 ) the would - be zero modes are not at zero because of taste - symmetry breaking , so are not fully effective in suppressing the topological charge at small quark mass .",
    "the latter effect is taken into account in eq ( [ eq : suscept_tb ] ) .    in light of our result",

    "the reanalysis is described in detail elsewhere @xcite . in this work",
    "we are concerned with the taste - breaking artifact .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "we see that correcting for staggered fermion artifacts removes roughly half the scaling violation in this range of pion masses .",
    "the rest can be attributed to the definition of the topological charge density operator , including smoothing @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that those corrections decrease as @xmath90 .",
    "we assume this form in carrying out the rough continuum extrapolation .",
    "the extrapolation to the continuum starts by fitting the measured points for each lattice spacing to the curve @xmath91 and then performing an extrapolation linearly in @xmath49 of the thus smoothed values of @xmath3 . in the left panel",
    "the extrapolation was done at constant goldstone pion mass @xmath92 ; in the right panel , at fixed @xmath93 . because staggered fermion artifacts contribute to scaling violations at fixed goldstone pion mass , and those artifacts decrease as @xmath94 , rather than @xmath90 , the extrapolation in fig  [ fig : chi_vs_mpi2](a ) is somewhat less plausible than the extrapolation in fig  [ fig : chi_vs_mpi2](b ) .    to make further progress we need simulations at a smaller lattice spacing .",
