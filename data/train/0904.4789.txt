    "this method is often refereed to as _ `` multi - code transmission , '' _ and has been considered in the high speed packet access ( hspa ) system @xcite . in mimo cdma systems ,",
    "multi - code transmission offers a spectrum efficiency that linearly increases in the order of the number of spreading codes and transmit antennas .",
    "this is achieved by assigning the same spreading code group to all transmit antennas . however , in severe frequency selective fading wireless channels , the performance of this scheme can dramatically deteriorate due to co - antenna interference ( cai ) and inter - chip interference ( ici ) .",
    "this results in a large delay ( due to multiple transmissions ) when an arq protocol is used in the link layer .",
    "motivated by this limitation , we investigate efficient hybrid ",
    "arq receiver schemes that allow to reduce the number of arq rounds required to correctly decode a data packet in mimo cdma arq systems with multi - code transmission .",
    "recently , cyclic - prefix ( cp ) aided single carrier ( sc ) cdma transmission with chip - level minimum mean square error ( mmse)-based frequency domain equalization ( fde ) has been introduced @xcite .",
    "it is a transceiver scheme that allows to achieve attractive performance with affordable computational complexity cost .",
    "turbo mmse - fde for cp - cdma has then been proposed to cope with severe ici @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", mmse fde has been applied to perform packet combining for multi - code cp - cdma systems with arq operating over severe frequency selective fading channels .",
    "it has recently been demonstrated that arq presents an important source of diversity in mimo systems @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown in @xcite that for both short and long - term static arq channel dynamics , multiple transmissions improve the diversity order of the corresponding mimo arq channel . the case of block - fading mimo arq , i.e. , multiple fading blocks are observed within the same arq round , has been reported in @xcite .",

    ", we consider chase - type arq with multi - code cp - cdma mimo transmission over broadband wireless channel .",
    "we propose two iterative ( turbo ) packet combining schemes where , at each arq round , the data packet is decoded by iteratively exchanging soft information in the form of log - likelihood ratios ( llrs ) between the soft - input  soft - output ( siso ) packet combiner and the siso decoder . in the first turbo packet",
    "combining scheme , we exploit the fact that both the cp chip - word and data packet are retransmitted at each arq round .",
    "this allows us to view each transmission as a group of virtual receive antennas , and build up a virtual mimo channel that takes into account both multi - antenna and multi - round transmission .",
    "we therefore perform combining of multiple transmissions jointly with chip - level soft mmse fde .",
    "this scheme is called _ chip - level packet combining_. in the second scheme , both chip - level soft mmse fde and despreading are separately carried out for each transmission . combining is then performed at the level of the soft symbol demapper .",
    "we analyze both the computational complexity and memory required by the proposed techniques , and show that they are less sensitive to the arq delay , i.e. , maximum number of arq rounds . finally , we evaluate and compare the throughput performance of the proposed schemes for some representative load factors ( i.e. , number of parallel codes with respect to the spreading factor ) and antenna configurations .    throughout this paper ,",

    "the number of rounds only influences the number of arithmetic additions required in the update procedures corresponding to recursions ( [ eq : y_update ] ) , ( [ eq : d_update ] ) , and ( [ eq : llr_comb ] ) . at each arq round ,",
    "the chip - level turbo combining algorithm involves @xmath116 arithmetic additions to update @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",

    "note that the number of additions does not have a great impact on receiver computational complexity .",
    "the required memory size is the major implementation constraint to take into account when choosing between chip - level and symbol - level combining . in the case of low - order modulations",

    "the broadband mimo channel has @xmath146 chip - spaced equal power taps , and the cp length is @xmath147 .",
    "the @xmath148 ratio appearing in all figures is the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) per chip per receive antenna .",

    "we observe that both combining schemes have similar throughput performance for quarter and half loads . in the case of full load",
    ", chip - level combining outperforms symbol - level combining in the region of low snr .",
    "for instance , the performance gap is around @xmath150db at @xmath151bit / s / hz throughput .",
    "also , note that for all configurations , the slopes of the throughput curves of both techniques are asymptotically similar to that of the mfb .",
    "therefore , both combining schemes asymptotically achieve the diversity order of the corresponding cp - cdma mimo arq channel .    in fig .",
