    "in recent years , we have seen many new experimental measurements in the neutral @xmath4 meson system both from the b - factories and the tevatron .",
    "while most observations agree well with the standard model ( sm ) , there are a few disagreements at the 2 or 3@xmath5 level .",
    "recently , the d@xmath6 collaboration has announced evidence for a charge asymmetry in the number of like - sign dimuon events @xcite , which can be interpreted as a @xmath0 violating asymmetry in @xmath1 meson oscillation rates and semileptonic decays .",
    "such an asymmetry could result from a phase difference @xmath7 between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , _",
    "s^sl ( -m^12_s/^12_s ) , where @xmath8 is the off diagonal term in the @xmath1 decay matrix resulting from interference between @xmath1 and @xmath10 decays , and @xmath9 is the @xmath2 mass mixing term . in the sm ,",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath9 is proportional to the weak cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix elements @xmath11 while @xmath8 is approximately proportional to @xmath12(v^{\\phantom{*}}_{cb } v^*_{cs } + v^{\\phantom{*}}_{ub } v^*_{us } ) v^{\\phantom{*}}_{cb } v^*_{cs}$ ] .",
    "ckm unitarity constrains @xmath13 to equal @xmath14 , predicting @xcite _ s^sl(sm ) _",
    "s^j/(sm)arg(- ) = 0.00420.0014 , therefore the sm prediction for the asymmetry is unmeasurably small , making the charge asymmetry an interesting place to look for new physics .",
    "several other observables in the @xmath1 system are in marginal disagreement with the sm . from the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , the average lifetime of the neutral @xmath1 mesons is @xmath15  ps and the lifetime of the neutral @xmath16 mesons is @xmath17  ps . the ratio of those two lifetimes is @xmath18 , which exhibits a @xmath19 deviation from the sm prediction of @xmath20  @xcite . using the measured width of the @xmath16 ( we assume that new physics does not modify the mixings in the @xmath16 system throughout this paper ) , the sm model prediction of the average width of @xmath1 is _ s(sm)=0.6540.008  ^-1 , while the measured average width is @xmath21 .",
    "the time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetry in @xmath22 decay also determines various mixing parameters in the @xmath1 mesons . using the combined results from d@xmath6 and cdf  @xcite with 0 - 2.8  fb@xmath23 luminosity , the two extracted quantities are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the @xmath0 violating phase difference between the mixing amplitude and the decay amplitude , and @xmath27 , the width difference , is predicted by the sm to be _ s(sm)=0.0980.024",
    "^-1  .the latest results from cdf with 2.8 - 5.2  fb@xmath23 luminosity are @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xcite . combining the results",
    ", we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 , differing by a modest @xmath32 from the sm .",
    "the recent like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry @xmath33 of semileptonic @xmath3-hadron decays from d@xmath6 is @xmath34  @xcite for 6.1  fb@xmath23 luminosity . using the sm predicted value of @xmath35 ( we assume that the new physics contribution in the @xmath16 system is small ) and combining with the explicit measurement @xmath36  @xcite , the charge asymmetry for  wrong - charge \" semileptonic @xmath1-meson decay is @xmath37 .",
    "the sm prediction is @xmath38  @xcite , which is off from the measured quantity by @xmath39 .",
    "the three quantities @xmath27 , @xmath7 and @xmath40 are not independent .",
    "we have the following relation among them  @xcite a^s_sl= =   .",
    "[ eq : aslbetas ] the mass difference is measured very precisely : @xmath41 .",
    "using the central value of @xmath42 and combining the measured values of @xmath40 and @xmath27 , we find a good fit with _",
    "s=0.1340.031  ^-1 , _",
    "s^sl=-1.660.64 , which are off from the sm predictions by @xmath43 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "as we are anticipating new physics contributions to @xmath8 which do not necessarily contribute to @xmath22 decays we distinguish the fit to @xmath44 from the fit to @xmath7 .    in constrast , the measured mass difference in the @xmath1 system and the ratio of the mass differences between the @xmath1 and @xmath16 systems can be used to extract ckm matrix elements which are in fair agreement with those extracted from other observables , although there is room for an @xmath45 contribution to either mass difference from new physics  @xcite .",
    "new physics can in principle contribute to both @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is not possible to get a good fit to the dimuon asymmetry obtained by d@xmath6 in terms of a new contribution to @xmath46 alone @xcite . when the sm value of @xmath8 is used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : aslbetas ] ) , fitting the leptonic asymmetry requires an unphysical value for the phase @xmath7 , _",
    "s^sl=-2.31.3   .a better fit is obtainable via a new contribution to @xmath8 , which also can better fit the modest deviations of @xmath47 and @xmath27 from the sm .",
    "a general feature of models with new contributions to @xmath8 is that , in contrast with models which only modify @xmath9 , the relation @xmath48 does not hold  @xcite .",
    "effective higher dimension operators offer a general approach to any short distance new physics .",
    "most attempts to explain the charge asymmetry have considered new short distance contributions  @xcite . in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath10 and decays into sm light particles , one can incorporate new physics by writing down effective operators and finding their allowed new decay channels .",
    "this approach reveals the difficulty of obtaining large new contributions to @xmath8 , and of obtaining a good fit to all available data .",
    "new dimension 6 contributions to @xmath2 operators contribute only to @xmath46 .",
    "it is theoretically straightforward to construct theories which will produce such contributions which are comparable to those of the sm , since the sm @xmath2 operators occur only at the one - loop level and furthermore are proportional to small off - diagonal @xmath49 elements .",
    "obtaining a new short distance contribution to @xmath8 requires @xmath50 operators which can contribute to @xmath3 quark decay .",
    "the sm @xmath50 operators are produced at tree level and so for new short distance physics to be important , there must be new tree level contributions to @xmath3 quark decays which are comparable to the contribution of the sm weak interactions .",
    "this is difficult to reconcile with the many successes of the sm in predicting lifetimes and branching fractions of @xmath4 hadrons .",
    "furthermore any new particles contributing to @xmath3 quark decays at the tree level also can produce @xmath2 operators at the one loop level , and so should give a large contribution to @xmath9 .",
    "a recent analysis of the constraints on nonstandard @xmath50 operators which could contribute to @xmath51 has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is however conceivable that new physics could also occur at longer distance scales , and would have escaped notice so far provided it is sufficiently weakly coupled to the sm particles . in this paper , we explore in a concrete model how new , weakly coupled physics at the several gev scale can give a large contribution to @xmath8 while giving a contribution to @xmath9 which is smaller than that of the sm .",
    "in particular , we assume that there is a new spin - zero particle , called @xmath52 , which can mix together with @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",
    "although the amount of mixing could be small ( otherwise a large modification on @xmath42 is anticipated ) , provided @xmath52 has a much larger width than the @xmath1 , @xmath27 can be increased to match the experimental value even with a very small mixing between @xmath52 and @xmath1 , @xmath10 .",
    "as the amount needed to increase @xmath27 is comparable to the amount needed for the discrepancy in @xmath47 , such a model may explain both anomalies .",
    "furthermore , if the mixing parameters between @xmath52 and @xmath1 , @xmath10 contain new @xmath0 violation phases of order unity , a large @xmath7 may be obtained to explain the charge asymmetry .    this new light scalar particle @xmath52 , which has a weak coupling to the sm particles , has many possible origins from a model building point of view . in this paper , we take a purely phenomenological approach .",
    "we treat this particle as a generic pseudoscalar , which for instance could be a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) .",
    "for example , it may behave as a familon  @xcite from some spontaneously broken approximate family symmetry . or it may be a meson in a hidden sector , perhaps composite .",
    "the @xmath52 particle may decay directly into sm particles or into other hidden states , which then decay into sm particles .    to have new contributions to @xmath27",
    ", one should have @xmath52 mixed with @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",
    "such mixing can also modify @xmath42 .",
    "simply from perturbation theory , one can estimate that the modifications on the widths are proportional to the square of the mixing angles , while the modifications on the masses have an additional factor proportional to the mass difference of @xmath52 and @xmath1 or @xmath10 .",
    "so , without doing detailed calculations , if the anomalies can be explained by mixing with another state , the contribution to @xmath42 can be reduced provided the new particle mass is close to the average @xmath1 meson mass : @xmath53 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will first describe the interactions of this new scalar field in section  [ sec : interactions ] , then we will diagonalize this three - particle system in section  [ sec : diagonalize ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "fit ] , we perform a @xmath54 based analysis to determine the best - fit region of the model parameter space . after that , we discuss various viable decay channels and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we will focus on flavor changing interactions of the new spinless particle with @xmath3 and @xmath55 quarks and leave its interactions with other particles for section  [ sec : conclusion ] .    for our analysis ,",
    "it is convenient to take @xmath52 to interact with sm fermions dominantly through derivative couplings , as would be the case for a pngb .",
    "general flavor changing interactions may be written as & = & _ ^-m_^2 ^ 2 + _ _",
    "i^(g^ij_v+g_a^ij_5)_j + h.c.+ , + & = & _ ^-m_^2 ^ 2- _ i_j + h.c.+ . here",
    ", @xmath56 is the pngb mass ; @xmath57 denotes mass eigenstate sm fermions ; and @xmath58 is a parameter which could be the spontaneous symmetry breaking scale of some global symmetry . the flavor - dependent couplings @xmath59 and @xmath60 are in general complex numbers . other couplings could also exist , but will not be relevant for this part of our analysis .",
    "we will consider some other interactions in section  [ sec : fit ] and [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the general interaction terms to describe the off - diagonal couplings with second and third generation quarks are -_^(g^bs_v+g_a^bs_5)s -_^(g^tc_v+g_a^tc_5)c + h.c . .",
    "[ eq : operators ] in a model where @xmath52 is related to the breaking of global flavor symmetries , we would anticipate @xmath61 , if the up - type quarks and down - type quarks transform similarly . in principle , this new particle @xmath52 can also couple to the first - generation quarks .",
    "we assume that such couplings are small and neglect them .",
    "for the first operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : operators ] ) , we integrate it by parts and use the following matrix element _ 0| ^_5 s ( 0 ) |b_s ( p ) = f_b_sm_b_s^2 , yielding mass mixing terms between @xmath52 and @xmath1 , @xmath10 e^if^2b_s + e^-if^2_s , with @xmath62 and @xmath63 . with @xmath64  gev  @xcite and @xmath65  gev , we have f=0.0026 ( ) ^-1/2  .",
    "[ eq : fandf ] we work in a basis where @xmath9 is real in order to give physical , reparameterization invariant , meaning to the phase @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath66 is not zero , a new source of @xmath0-violation enters the @xmath1 and @xmath10 system .",
    "the @xmath52 field may decay into other light particles in its own hidden sector , or into sm particles . at this moment , we will simply assume it has a non - negligible width @xmath67 and come back its decays later .",
    "so , in the model we are considering , there are four parameters needed to compute the effects of mixing with @xmath52 on the @xmath1 system : @xmath56 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath66 .",
    "the mass - squared matrix can be written in the basis @xmath69 as         the new decay modes should account for approximately 3.5% of the total width of the @xmath1 using the best - fit region in fig  [ fig : massivewidth ] .",
    "so , if future experimental results find those new decay modes of @xmath1 in table  [ tab : decaymodes ] but not for @xmath16 , our prediction for this new state @xmath52 would be confirmed .",
    "before we end our paper , we make comments about the second operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : operators ] ) .",
    "this operator can induce flavor changing neutral current type decays of the top quark : @xmath70 . depending on the final states of @xmath52 decay , there may exist a decay channel like @xmath71 , with the invariant mass of the @xmath72 pair around 5 gev .",
    "the branching ratio of this new decay channel is calculated as ( t c + ) = 1.010 ^ -7 ( ) ^2 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fandf ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : massivewidth ] , we see that if @xmath73 the explanation of anomalies in the @xmath1 symmetry in the familon framework predicts this branching ratio should be around @xmath74 , which may be tested at the lhc .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that several anomalies in the @xmath1 system can be explained simultaneously if there is a new pseudoscalar , the @xmath52 , mixing with @xmath1 mesons . from fitting to the five observables : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath47 , @xmath7 and @xmath77 , this pseudoscalar is predicted to have a mass around @xmath78  gev and a width around @xmath79  gev .",
    "many viable decay modes can be found for the new pseudoscalar . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath16 , and @xmath80 should have non - negligible branching ratios of around @xmath81 into a kaon ( or other fragmentation modes of @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) plus the decay modes of the @xmath52 , such as those listed in table  [ tab : decaymodes ] .",
    "likewise the @xmath1 should have a branching fraction of around @xmath81 into @xmath84 fragmentation states such as @xmath85 or @xmath86 , plus the decay modes of the @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath1 branching fraction into the @xmath52 decay modes ( with no additional particles ) should be about @xmath87 .",
    "our model can be tested at the tevatron and the lhc , particularly lhcb .",
    "we also emphasize that @xmath88 in our model , in constrast with models in which new physics contributed only to @xmath9 .",
    "more precise measurements of those two quantities would therefore distinguish our explanation of anomalies in the @xmath1 system from other approaches .",
    "our motivation for this model is to better fit experimental data , and we have not attempted to justify the naturalness of the model or to discuss the theoretical implications of such a new particle or particles , other than to make sure the model can be consistent with other experimental results .",
    "however we note that light pseudoscalars resulting from spontaneously broken approximate symmetries are common in models of flavor physics and/or dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking at the weak scale , as well as in models with new strongly coupled hidden sectors , which have a variety of theoretical motivations .",
    "it may seem somewhat surprising or coincidental that an exotic hidden meson should have a mass which is rather close to that of the @xmath1 , however this is the simplest viable way we are aware of to get a large contribution to @xmath8 .",
