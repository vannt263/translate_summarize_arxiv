    "both in classical and quantum physics , a complete framework for the description of equilibrium properties of arbitrary physical many - body systems exists , although the explicit calculation of many - body equilibrium properties is an often unsolved challenge .",
    "the situation is much less satisfactory when it comes to the study of the non - equilibrium properties of many - body systems , where such a general framework is missing and may not even exist .",
    "research in this field has therefore focussed on relatively specific issues and types of non - equilibrium .",
    "one of the issues taking center stage is whether quantum many - body systems in non - equilibrium evolving coherently under a local hamiltonian equilibrate or not .",
    "if so , one may ask whether the equilibrium states can in some sense be described by a thermal state .",
    "this old and fundamental question of the equilibration of quantum many - body systems has enjoyed quite a renaissance recently [ 136 ] .    a specific setting of coherent non - equilibrium quantum dynamics is provided by quantum _ quenches _ , where one starts from an eigenstate of some initial hamiltonian and pushes the system out of equilibrium by a sudden change ( or  quench \" ) of system parameters , leading to a new hamiltonian .",
    "one then considers the evolution of the system under the new hamiltonian . a further restriction is provided by the assumption that the quantum system under consideration is _ closed _",
    ", i.e. ,  has no coupling to a bath of degrees of freedom that might assist the relaxation process .",
    "time evolution ( and hence the potential relaxation to some equilibrium ) will obviously be constrained by the constants of motion , i.e. ,  hermitian operators commuting with the new hamiltonian whose expectation values are fixed by the initial state ; in that sense , any relaxed state will to a certain degree show some memory of the initial state .",
    "it has been conjectured that  in some sense the quantum system should relax to the maximum entropy state consistent with the expectation values of the constants of motion fixed by the initial state ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , also referred to as a generalized gibbs ensemble @xcite .",
    "this may be attractive because it reminds of jaynes derivation of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "this observation is in conflict with the fact that obviously , if the system can be meaningfully treated as a _ closed _ quantum system , one can not expect the whole system to relax : initially pure states will remain so in time under a unitary time evolution [ 26 ] . after all ,",
    "the entire information about the initial condition is still stored in the system , albeit in a dilute fashion . yet",
    ", this observation is by no means in contradiction with the possibility that in any local observation , the system may appear perfectly relaxed , even without invoking a time average @xcite .",
    "the key point is that _ locally _ , one may well expect the relaxation to be true @xcite : for any subset of sites in a sufficiently large lattice system , the reduced state may well converge to the reduced state of the maximum entropy state , given the conserved quantities of motion , and stay relaxed for an arbitrary long time .",
    "indeed , for such a subset it is , under suitable assumptions about its interactions with the rest of the world , easy to make contact to jaynes formulation of statistical mechanics .    ref .",
    "@xcite considers a variant of the question in which this local relaxation of subsystems , referred to as _ local relaxation conjecture _ , can in fact be rigorously proven to hold exactly : this is the one where one evolves a state deep in a mott phase according to a bose - hubbard hamiltonian corresponding to the deep superfluid phase  treated as a non - interacting system . in this setting",
    ", the local relaxation is in fact true : the reduced state of a block @xmath1 of consecutive sites indeed converges to a maximum entropy state @xmath2 ( in trace norm ) for large systems and large times , having maximum entropy consistent with the constants of motion @xcite .",
    "note that there is no time average and the initial state is not a gaussian state .",
    "also , for free bosonic and fermionic systems , and for gaussian initial states , it has been shown rigorously in refs.@xcite under which conditions the local relaxation conjecture is true .",
    "it turns out that in these cases , the presence and speed of local relaxation depends crucially on the single - particle spectrum and the dimensionality of the systems .",
    "the in some sense inverse case of a quench from the superfluid phase to the mott insulating phase , but generally at finite interaction strengths , has been studied in ref.@xcite . in this non - integrable system , numerically two distinct non - equilibrium regimes have been found where equilibrated states resembled thermal states or states with memory .    the physical intuition why local relaxation happens is the following : if one switches to a new hamiltonian , the system is no longer in equilibrium .",
    "hence , one has local excitations at each point [ 2 , 3 , 1216 ] .",
    "they can not travel arbitrarily fast , however , as there is a finite speed of information transfer in lattice systems @xcite .",
    "at each site , in time more and more `` waves '' of farther and farther away sites can possibly have a significant influence on this site .",
    "this is related to a finite speed of sound or of information transfer in a lattice system @xcite .",
    "then , local relaxation may be a consequence of the incommensurate influence of these excitations generating mixing and thermalization .",
    "thermalization \" time scale is hence governed by the speed of information transfer @xcite .",
    "this also links to kinematical approaches to the problem [ 37 , 4751 ] , arguing that most states anyway look locally very much relaxed in that they have large entropy . a random pure state ( as taken from the haar measure ) will locally have a large entropy .",
    "specifically , in interacting systems one should expect such a local relaxation to be true , too , an aspect that will be studied in this work .",
    "so far the discussion has not taken into account the recurrence happening in any closed quantum or classical system @xcite . for finite , but large system sizes , recurrence times",
    "will however become so long that recurrence effects become negligible , in that the quantum many - body system can be effectively locally equilibrated on a much shorter time scale than the recurrence time .",
    "we will see that while settings exhibiting local relaxation may be generated in various fashions , it is a greater challenge to actually probe signatures of local relaxation .",
    "this apparent dilemma  that to demonstrate local relaxation appears to necessitate local addressing  will be resolved in this work , by making use of a period-@xmath0 setting , further developing the idea of ref .",
    "the taken path opens up a way to experimentally explore local relaxation effects using atoms in optical superlattices .",
    "we systematically investigate various aspects of local relaxation in such a setting , both using analytical as well as numerical methods , based on a time - dependent density - matrix renormalization - group ( t - dmrg ) approach .",

    "the current surge of interest in the relaxation of quantum systems after a quench is mainly motivated by the advent of ultracold atoms in optical lattices [ 5256 ] .",
    "these systems are highly attractive as they allow for sudden controlled manipulations of system parameters , hence quenches , are strongly interacting , hence non - trivial , are on experimental time scales essentially closed quantum systems , and therefore show coherent quantum dynamics .",
    "systems are also sufficiently large to show non - trivial many - body behavior .    in the present context ,",
    "however , the major drawback of ultracold atoms is that despite the unprecedented possibilities of manipulation the study of _ local relaxation _ provides an experimental challenge .",
    "this is due to the fact that local ( i.e. ,  site - resolved ) measurements on ultracold atoms in optical lattices are still not satisfactory , albeit rapid progress is being made . in this work , we propose to study instances of local relaxation even in a setting where strictly local quantities can not easily be studied by using _ optical superlattices _ [ 5760 ] .    following the setup very recently realized by bloch and coworkers @xcite",

    "allows for the preparation of _ patterns _ of atoms and for extracting _ local _ quantities to the degree that odd and even sites can be distinguished from each other :    * _ preparation of periodic patterns _ is achieved by loading the superlattice while introducing a bias between odd and even sites such that due to a shifting of particles all particles are on either odd or even sites after loading . using further experimental techniques @xcite , multiple occupancies on the occupied sites",
    "can be eliminated , leaving a sequence of empty and single - occupied sites .",
    "* _ period-@xmath0 local _ measurements can be obtained by mapping odd and even sites to different brillouin zones : assuming completely decoupled double wells , each part of the double well has multiple bands separated by well - defined energies .",
    "biasing , say , the odd sites relative to the even sites by an energy in excess of the separation energy of the band - separation energy , odd - site particles are reloaded into the higher band of the even sites , whereas the even - site particles stay in the lower band .",
    "a standard time - of - flight mapping then shows the even - site particles in the first brillouin zone , the odd - site particles in the higher brillouin zones . *",
    "_ more sophisticated measurements with period-@xmath0 _ can also be performed in principle .",
    "when letting the system evolve for some defined hold time , and then freezing the time evolution by ramping up the barrier , one can also measure nearest - neighbor correlations in the lattice @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to proceed here : on the one hand , one can isolate double wells , let them dephase .",
    "then upon free expansion , the average correlations can be measured as in a double slit experiment .",
    "one the other hand , correlations can be mapped to densities . to the extent that the barrier between the wells is sufficiently high such that the time evolution can be described by a collection of double well systems ( and higher wannier bands",
    "do not have to be taken into account ) , we can investigate the time evolution in each individual double well . up to the presence of a confining potential , the total time evolution",
    "then reflects the time evolution in each of the double wells .",

    ", one can also measure the real part .",
    "if one has small interactions ( because of the wannier band problem  a description in terms of wannier functions still has to be valid , accompanied by a non - vanishing @xmath17 ) , then this leads to a small dephasing in this mapping .",
    "direct numerical simulation can take this properly into account , allowing for a correct interpretation of the experimental observation .",

    "the time scale is @xmath147 , as this is when the first collisions happen and establish correlations .",
    "the second time regime is associated with _",
    "local relaxation_. there is fast oscillating dynamics between neighboring sites , happening at a time scale dictated by the hopping @xmath21 , which also governs the speed of sound .",
    "local relaxation as such is slow , in the exact analysis a slow polynomial decay : the bessel function fulfills @xmath148 as a strict bound , with an asymptotic envelope @xmath149 one finds relaxation ( _ not _ due to decoherence but due the dilution of information over the lattice ) to the true local equilibrium . for finite @xmath17 , numerics is consistent with polynomial decay , which for intermediate @xmath17 seems to be much _",
    "faster _ , but still polynomial .",
    "+ the intuition is that this local relaxation is due to influences of excitations travelling with the speed of information propagation from farther and farther lattice sites , broadened by _",
    "dispersion_. this means that this time scale , even in the interacting case of @xmath150 , should be defined by the _ speed of information propagation _ in the system .",
    "note that to date , there is no rigorous bound known to the speed of information propagation in the fully interacting bose - hubbard model ( this being a consequence of the lattice sites having an unbounded number of particles , see also comments in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . on physical grounds , yet , it should be expected to be similar to @xmath21 , i.e.  `` ballistic '' transport at the high energies provided by the quench , slightly modified by @xmath17 ( possibly the resulting bounds can only be formulated for specific initial states having small local particle number ) .",
    "this is also what the numerics shows .",
    "note that the low - energy speed of sound need not be relevant here .",
    "the third ( very large ) time is the _ recurrence time _ , which seems to be shortened substantially in the presence of a realistic trap .",
    "as in the presence of a trap , the excitations no longer travel with a constant speed ( the speed of sound ) , but are slowly reflected , one should expect a quicker relaxation , and this is also the behavior the analytics exhibits .",
    "generally , for moderate to large system sizes it is already beyond the reach of our simulations .",
    "it would be interesting to see , possibly in exact diagonalization , whether the recurrences are weakened compared to the free solutions due to interactions in the system , see also ref.@xcite .    while these findings are essentially independent of the interaction strength @xmath17 , we also find three local relaxation regimes for different @xmath17 :    * for very small values of @xmath17 ( up to @xmath151 ) relaxation dynamics is quite close to the non - interacting bosonic limit .",
    "* for larger values of @xmath17 the system seems to show a behavior very similar to the hard core bosonic or free fermionic limit with similar relaxation exponents of order @xmath152 .",

    "the case of intermediate @xmath153 appears to be a special case for various observables , marking the `` boundary '' between the `` free bosonic case '' @xmath11 and the `` hard core boson case '' @xmath36 , so the fermionic one .",
    "collisions lead to the most efficient relaxation in this case .",
    "to summarize , the dynamics of local quantities shown is consistent with the limiting @xmath11 and @xmath36 cases , but shows a richer phenomenology in particular for intermediate @xmath17 .",
    "in this subsection , we briefly compare what is seen in the above local relaxation with the situation in momentum space .",
    "the quasi- momentum distribution , @xmath154 obtainable from time - of - flight experiments , is no longer a local quantity , but a global one probing the state of the entire lattice , as well as the boundary conditions and possibly a confining additional potential .",

    "this linear increase , provably correct in the above cases , is consistent with a wealth of numerical findings in quenched systems , as well as with arguments using conformal field theory @xcite .    knowing that we have to asymptotically deal with a linear increase , we have plotted the entanglement entropy as obtained from a t - dmrg approach .",

    "this is an interesting programme and the proof constitutes an interesting challenge in case of interacting systems , which has not yet been completed . in case of free systems as in ref .",

    "in this work , we have introduced a setting in which local relaxation in quantum many - body systems can be probed , without the need of actually addressing single sites : this is the setting of a bose - hubbard model , in which preparation and read - out can be done with period-@xmath0 translational invariance , as can be achieved by exploiting optical superlattices .",
    "we have approached this idea by deriving analytical expressions for the relevant quantities in case of the free limits of @xmath11 and @xmath36 in the bose - hubbard model , as well as using a systematic t - dmrg approach in the time - dependent interacting case . for the @xmath11 case , we presented in detail a true convergence of subsystems to the maximum entropy state in @xmath10-norm .",
    "in several ways , the interacting setting reminded of the non - interacting case , certainly concerning the mechanism of relaxation .",
    "the time - scales are different , however , showing a faster relaxation compared to the inverse square - root dependence .",
    "also , the dependence on the interaction strength reflects the same dependence in the corresponding gibbs state of the hamiltonian the system is quenched to .    in this way",
    ", signatures of local relaxation can be measured with present technology : local densities are found to relax to those of a quasi - thermal state on well - defined time scales , often with a similar to inverse square - root time dependence .",
    "more sophisticated measurements would reveal correlators and density - density correlations , again showing local relaxation in a characteristic fashion .",
    "hence , by exploiting period-@xmath0 translational invariance , one has a tool at hand that effectively can be viewed as if one looked at a small local subsystem , showing all signatures of the local relaxation . in turn",
