    "the `` persistence '' of a continuous stochastic process has been the subject of considerable recent interest among both theoreticians and experimentalists in the field of nonequilibrium processes .",
    "persistence is the probability @xmath11 that a stochastic variable @xmath12 of zero mean does not change sign up to time @xmath13 .",
    "systems studied include reaction - diffusion processes , phase - ordering kinetics , fluctuating interfaces and simple diffusion from random initial conditions @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements have been carried out on breath figures @xcite , liquid crystals @xcite , soap froths @xcite , and diffusion of xe gas in one dimension @xcite . in `` coarsening '' systems like these , which do not possess a definite length or time scale ,",
    "the persistence has a power - law decay , @xmath14 , at late times , and the persistence exponent @xmath15 is in general non - trivial . in such systems , the normalized two - time correlation function , @xmath16^{1/2}$ ]",
    "has the `` scaling '' form , @xmath17 , depending only on the ratio of the two times . in such systems ,",
    "a simplification is achieved by introducing the logarithmic time - scale @xmath18 , and the normalized variable @xmath19 , since the correlation function of @xmath20 depends only on the time difference @xmath21 , i.e.   the process @xmath4 is stationary .",
    "thus one is led to consider stationary stochastic processes .",
    "these processes are , of course , also of interest in their own right . in the new time variable",
    ", the persistence decays exponentially , @xmath22 .",
    "in this paper we consider the integrated quantity @xmath23 \\label{rdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is an arbitrary function of the stochastic variable @xmath4 .",
    "hence @xmath6 is a functional of @xmath24 .",
    "for the special case @xmath25 , where @xmath10 is the heaviside step function , @xmath6 is just the fraction of time for which @xmath26 in the time interval @xmath27 . in this case , the probability distribution , @xmath1 , of @xmath6 for given @xmath0 is just the `` residence -time '' distribution which , together with the related `` sign - time '' distribution , where @xmath28 , has attracted a lot of attention earlier in the mathematics literature@xcite and more recently in the statistical physics community@xcite . here we consider a general function @xmath3 .",
    "we restrict our attention , however , to the class of processes where @xmath4 is a stationary gaussian markov process , for which some analytic progress can be made . a case of some interest , which we analyze in detail ,",
    "is @xmath29 .",
    "this case is relevant to weather derivatives as we now explain .",
    "it has been estimated that about 1 trillion dollars of the 7 trillion dollar us economy is weather related @xcite . for example , weather conditions directly affect agricultural outputs and the demand for energy products and indirectly affect retail businesses @xcite .",
    "weather derivatives , first introduced in 1997 , are financial instruments which allow hedging ( by , for example , energy suppliers ) against adverse weather conditions over a period of time . here `` adverse '' might mean an unusually warm winter , when low demand for energy would affect the supplier s profits , as well as an unusually cold one when the supplier is unable to meet the demand .",
    "temperature derivatives , the most common form of weather derivatives , are based on the concepts of `` heating degree days '' and `` cooling degree days '' , which are ( rough ) measures of the cumulative demand for heating and cooling respectively .",
    "let @xmath4 be the temperature at time @xmath0 in a given city . on a given day ,",
    "@xmath30 , the mean , @xmath31 , of the highest and lowest temperatures is recorded .",
    "the number of cooling degree days ( @xmath32 ) , over a period of @xmath33 days , is given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a reference , or baseline , temperature , while the number of heating degree days ( @xmath36 ) is @xmath37 .",
    "in the present paper we will , for simplicity , use an integral over continuous time rather than a sum , so that the cooling degree days are given by @xmath38 \\,h[x(t ' )   - x_o]$ ] , where @xmath10 is the heaviside step function .",
    "thus @xmath32 is the integrated temperature excess ( over the reference temperature ) restricted to those periods where the temperature is above the reference level .",
    "it is a crude measure of the amount of cooling ( air conditioning ) required during the period @xmath0 and also of the energy required to produce this cooling .",
    "note that the power consumption of an air conditioner actually varies , for small temperature differences , as the square of the temperature difference between the room and ambient temperatures , so a better measure of the energy required would be @xmath39 ^ 2 \\,h[x(t ' ) -   x_o]$ ] , instead of @xmath32 . in the notation of this paper , @xmath40 , with @xmath41 in eq .",

    "we will instead employ a simple , though unrealistic , model in which the temperature , @xmath4 , is taken to be a stationary gaussian markov process .",
    "we will discuss the limitations of this model , and possible improvements , in the conclusion .",
    "as a further simplification , we take the reference temperature @xmath35 to be the mean of @xmath4 , though this simplification is not essential and can be relaxed .",

    ", @xmath6 lies in the range @xmath46 , and it is clear that @xmath47 is just the usual persistence exponent , @xmath15 , since @xmath48 requires @xmath49 for @xmath50 . in section iii ,",
    "the method is illustrated on a number of special cases , of which @xmath51 and @xmath52 are studied first as exactly - soluble tutorial illustrations before turning to the cdd problem ( in the simple form outlined above ) and finally the sign - time distribution .",
    "the last two examples can be solved analytically in various regimes , and numerically elsewhere .",
    "section iv concludes with a discussion and summary of the results .",

    "in fact , for renewal type processes where the successive intervals are statistically independent , the  sign - time \" distribution has been computed by godrche and luck@xcite using the interval size distribution as an input .",
    "their result can be simply extended to calculate the  sign - time distribution for the ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "the iia also has the virtue that it can be used to obtain approximate results for non - markov processes .",
    "persistence exponents , for example , are often given rather accurately by the iia @xcite .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to adapt this iia method to general nonlinear functions @xmath3 , whereas the path - integral approach and mapping onto quantum mechanics adopted here is readily applicable to any @xmath3 .",
    "here we have only considered gaussian markov processes mainly because they are simple and amenable to analytical calculations . recently the calculations of the asymptotic distributions for the  sign - time \" and other related quantities such as  local - time \" have been extended to non - gaussian markov processes where a brownian particle moves in an arbitrary stable or unstable potential and moreover exact results have been obtained@xcite when the underlying potential is random as in the sinai model .",
    "the extension of these methods and results presented here to non - markov processes , however , still remains as one of the outstanding challenges for the future .",
