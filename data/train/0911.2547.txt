    "@xmath6 with strangeness @xmath0 and baryon number @xmath7 is evidently a flavor exotic state with minimal quark content @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the first announcement of its experimental detection was made in 2003 @xcite , and it has since confronted the hadron physics community with interesting novel phenomena and unanticipated problems that have not been solved until the present day .",
    "presently , the experimental situation of @xmath6 seems to be rather unclear .",
    "after the clas collaboration has published several papers on their pentaquark search with high statistics @xcite , where no signal of @xmath9 could be found , many people now seem to believe that the pentaquark does not exist after all and that the whole story was just  a curious episode in the history of science \" @xcite .",
    "there are , however still experiments that claim to observe a signal of @xmath6 @xcite and therefore this issue should not be considered to be completely settled yet .",
    "additional experimental results , which either unambiguously confirm the existence of @xmath6 or otherwise can eliminate it completely , are eagerly waited for .    theoretically , one not yet well understood property of @xmath6 is its unnaturally narrow width , which was reported to be even less than @xmath10 @xcite and which is very difficult to explain from our experience with ordinary baryons . because @xmath6 lies about @xmath11 above the @xmath2 threshold",
    ", one would expect the width to be much larger than the experimentally measured value .",
    "of course , there have been many attempts to explain this narrow width of @xmath6 @xcite , but none of these approaches has completely succeeded yet .",
    "another problem is the correct assignment of quantum numbers such as spin and parity to the @xmath6 state .",
    "there are many studies , in which states with various quantum numbers were investigated using qcd sum rules @xcite or lattice qcd @xcite , but no consistent understanding has yet emerged .",
    "the main subject of the present paper is to determine the quantum numbers ( isospin , spin , and parity ) of @xmath6 from a qcd sum rule approach .",
    "we therefore study and compare the sum rules of states with @xmath1 . from this comparison ,",
    "we aim to determine which of the investigated quantum numbers is the one that most likely has to be assigned to the @xmath6 state .",
    "furthermore , we also look for possible excited states below @xmath12 , that may be found in future experiments . for these purposes we use an improved version of the qcd sum rule method , which has first been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of improvement is to use the difference of two correlators to construct the sum rule .",
    "the continuum part of the spectral function is significantly suppressed by this procedure , which therefore helps to find a valid borel window , whose existence is a necessary condition for obtaining reliable results within the qcd sum rule technique .",
    "moreover , we calculate the operator product expansion ( ope ) up to dimension 14 , which is indispensable for a sufficient convergence of the expansion .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the formalism of qcd sum rules is briefly reviewed .",
    "the details of our method , including the interpolating fields employed and the implications of the improvement mentioned in the last paragraph are then explained in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , the results of the analysis for the various quantum numbers are given in detail .",
    "these results are then discussed in sec .",
    "v and the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "finally , the appendix is devoted to the numerical results of the ope and to the details of the establishment of the borel window for the various sum rules .",
    "in the qcd sum rule method @xcite , we compute the two - point function of various operators .",
    "it is defined as @xmath13|0\\rangle \\\\ & \\equiv \\pi_1(q^2 ) \\slash{q } + \\pi_2(q^2 ) , \\label{eq : cor1 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a spin @xmath15 operator .",
    "@xmath16 is called the chiral - even , and @xmath17 the chiral - odd part .",
    "furthermore , the two - point function of a spin @xmath18 rarita - schwinger type operator @xmath19 is defined as @xmath20|0\\rangle \\\\ & \\equiv -g_{\\mu\\nu}[\\pi_1(q^2 ) \\slash{q } + \\pi_2(q^2 ) ] + \\dots , \\label{eq : cor2 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the dots stand for other lorentz structures than @xmath21 . in the present study",
    ", we will only need the terms containing @xmath21 .",
    "we use the same notation as for the spin @xmath15 case and denote @xmath16 as the chiral - even , and @xmath17 as the chiral - odd part .    in the qcd sum rule approach ,",
    "we use the analytic properties of these two - point functions to extract information of the physical states that couple to the operators @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "concretely , the analyticity of eqs.([eq : cor1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cor2 ] ) allows one to write down the dispersion relation @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "this equation has the same form for both the spin @xmath15 and spin @xmath18 case . to handle a possible divergence in the integral of the right - hand side ,",
    "usually the subtracted dispersion relation is used .",
    "this means that subtraction terms have to be added to this equation , which contribute mainly to the high - energy part of the spectral function .",
    "the significance of these terms for the low - energy region is hence small .",
    "moreover , the subtraction terms will disappear when the borel transformation is applied as they are polynomials of @xmath26 .",
    "we will thus omit them in the following .",
    "the imaginary part of the two - point function @xmath27 , which corresponds to the spectral function of @xmath22 or @xmath23 , satisfies the following spectral conditions : @xmath28 thus , the positivity condition only holds for the chiral - even part , while the spectral function obtained from the chiral - odd part is allowed to have negative values .    in this study",
    ", we employ the usual  pole + continuum \" parametrization for the spectral function , which appears in the imaginary part of the correlator @xmath29 the @xmath30-function for the ground state pole is justified by the experimental results , which show that the width of @xmath6 is very narrow .",
    "the potential contribution of the @xmath2 scattering states , which are not included in the expression above will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ knscat ] .",
    "furthermore , to obtain consistent results , it is important to choose an appropriate operator in the two - point function , whose spectral function resembles that of eq.([eq : pole ] ) as much as possible . in other words ,",
    "the chosen operator should couple strongly to the ground state pole ( if it exists ) , leading to a large value of the residue @xmath31 and at the same time should only have a small overlap with the continuum states , which are included in the parametrization of eq.([eq : pole ] ) only above the threshold parameter @xmath32 . in the present study",
    ", we will try to construct such an operator by considering linear combinations of two independent operators and then fixing the mixing angles so that the results are consistent with the ansatz of eq.([eq : pole ] ) .    while the low - energy part of the spectral function below the threshold parameter @xmath32 is phenomenologically parametrized as in eq.([eq : pole ] ) , the left - hand side of eq.([eq : disp ] ) and the second term of eq.([eq : pole ] ) are calculated analytically using the ope .",
    "the results of this calculation can be generally expressed as follows : @xmath33 here , @xmath34 contain various quark and gluon condensates and numerical factors .",
    "the next step in the calculation is to apply the borel transformation , which is defined as @xmath35 \\equiv \\lim_{\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{-q^2,n \\to \\infty , } { -q^2/n = m^2 } } \\frac{(-q^2)^{n+1}}{n ! } \\bigg(\\frac{d}{dq^2}\\bigg)^n",
    "\\pi_i(q^2 ) , \\label{eq : boreltrans1}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the so - called borel mass .",
    "there are several reasons for using this transformation : firstly , the high - energy continuum part of the spectral function and the higher - order terms in the ope are suppressed by the factors @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "this considerably improves the accuracy of the sum rules .",
    "secondly , as already mentioned above , the borel transformation removes the subtraction terms in eq.([eq : disp ] ) and therefore eliminates possible ambiguities originating from these terms .",
    "substituting eq.([eq : pole ] ) into the dispersion relation of eq.([eq : disp ] ) , and applying the borel transformation , the following expressions can be obtained : @xmath39 @xmath40 from these equations , the expressions for @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be extracted straightforwardly : @xmath43 @xmath44 notice that @xmath41 can be calculated independently either from the chiral - even term @xmath45 or from the chiral - odd term @xmath46 . in this study we will mainly use @xmath45 to calculate @xmath41 and refer to @xmath46 only for determining the parity of the investigated state .    here ,",
    "the borel mass @xmath36 and the threshold parameter @xmath32 are variable parameters , which allow us to obtain distinct sum rules in eqs.([eq : mass ] ) and ( [ eq : residue ] ) for each chosen value of @xmath36 and @xmath32 .",
    "comparing these different sum rules , it is possible to extract information on the shape of the investigated spectral function and on the physical states that contribute to the sum rules most strongly .",
    "we will discuss this issue in detail in the later sections .",
    "the parity of the presumed ground state pole can not be determined from the sum rule of the chiral - even ( or chiral - odd ) part alone , as @xmath14 or @xmath19 couple to both states with positive and negative parity regardless of their own intrinsic parity . to this end",
    ", we use the parity - projected sum rules @xcite to obtain information on the parity of the investigated state . in this method , instead of eqs.([eq : cor1 ] ) or ( [ eq : cor2 ] ) , the ",
    "old fashioned \" green function is considered in the rest frame ( @xmath47 ) : @xmath48 here , only the spin @xmath15 case is shown .",
    "this expression leads then to two independent sum rules for states coupling to @xmath14 with positive and negative parity respectively .",
    "these are given as @xmath49e^{-q_0 ^ 2/m^2 } , \\label{eq : ope3 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the intrinsic parity of the operator has been assumed to be positive . in the opposite case",
    "the signs of the right - hand side have to be switched .",
    "@xmath50 is the threshold parameter corresponding to @xmath51 in eq.([eq : pole ] ) .",
    "we now have three sum rules , eqs.([eq : ope1]),([eq : ope2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ope3 ] ) , which must in principle give the same results for @xmath41 . however , the ope of the chiral - odd part @xmath52 has turned out to contain ambiguous terms in the first power of the strange quark mass @xmath53 , related to an infrared divergence originating in the perturbative treatment of @xmath53 . to circumvent this problem",
    ", we will use only the sum rule of the chiral - even part of eq.([eq : ope1 ] ) ( where the divergencies do not occur ) to calculate the mass of the ground state .",
    "meanwhile , eq.([eq : ope3 ] ) will be applied in the chiral limit ( @xmath54 = 1 , @xmath55 ) in order to determine the parity of the ground state .",
    "it is well known since the qcd sum rule method has been formulated , that the condition of an existing borel window provides an essential check of the accuracy of the method .",
    "we define the borel window as the region of the borel mass where the following two conditions are satisfied .",
    "terms}}(q^2)\\bigr ] } \\le 0.1 .",
    "\\label{eq : conv}\\ ] ] @xmath57 eq.([eq : conv ] ) is a necessary condition for the ope to converge .",
    "it gives a lower limit for the borel mass because the higher - order terms are suppressed for larger @xmath36 as can be seen in eqs.([eq : ope1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ope2 ] ) . on the other hand , eq.([eq : polecontr ] ) ensures that the low - energy part of the spectral function dominates the sum rules , and that contributions from high - energy states do not deteriorate the result .",
    "it is therefore necessary that the high - energy part of the spectral function is sufficiently suppressed .",
    "as the suppression is stronger for smaller @xmath36 , this condition gives an upper bound for the borel mass .",
    "one may wonder what the rationale for the numbers on the right - hand side of eqs.([eq : conv ] ) and ( [ eq : polecontr ] ) is .",
    "these numbers are in fact chosen quite reasonably , which can be understood from the following considerations .",
    "the main uncertainties in a qcd sum rule calculation in most cases originate from ambiguities of the vacuum condensates which often have error bars considerably larger than @xmath58 .",
    "this justifies the usage of eq.([eq : conv ] ) as choosing any much smaller number than @xmath59 on the right - hand side of this condition would be meaningless .",
    "moreover , in order for the low - energy states below @xmath32 to contribute most strongly to the sum rules and that thus an inappropriate parametrization of the high - energy states do not introduce too large errors , the right - hand side of ( [ eq : polecontr ] ) is also a natural choice , as is known from experience with sum rules of other baryons and mesons @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can have some confidence that the errors coming from the neglected higher - order terms of the ope and the possible inaccurate description of the spectral function above @xmath32 are under control if both conditions of eqs.([eq : conv ] ) and ( [ eq : polecontr ] ) are satisfied .",
    "let us now discuss the difficulties of establishing a borel window in pentaquark studies . as has been discussed above and also in @xcite ,",
    "the existence of a valid borel window is essential for obtaining reliable results within the qcd sum rule technique .",
    "nevertheless almost all earlier studies investigating pentaquark states with qcd sum rules @xcite did not consider this problem and therefore these results should not be seen as to be conclusive .",
    "the reason why all these studies have ignored this issue , is that , in fact , it is very difficult ( if not impossible ) to establish a valid borel window in the conventional qcd sum rules described so far in this paper .",
    "there are basically two difficulties .",
    "firstly , the convergence of the ope of the correlator of a five - quark operator is slower compared to the case of nonexotic baryons containing only three quarks .",
    "this can be understood from a simple argument : graphs containing quark loops are multiplied by a factor of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 : number of quark loops ) , which comes from the integration of the momenta in each loop , and the graphs of higher - order terms , where some of the quark loops are cut , are thus enhanced @xcite . therefore one can expect that the ope starts to converge only after all the quark loops are being cut . for the pentaquark calculation , this happens only for terms of dimension 12 ( or higher ) and one therefore needs to calculate the ope at least up to dimension 12 to make sure that all the terms with a possible large contribution are included .",
    "this problem can in principle be solved if one calculates the ope up to high enough orders ( which is a tedious , but straightforward task , if one uses the vacuum saturation approximation ) .",
    "the second difficulty is more severe : because of the high dimensionality of the interpolating field of the pentaquark ( 15/2 compared to 9/2 for an ordinary three - quark baryon ) , the high - energy part of the spectral function well above the presumed @xmath9 resonance is enhanced and therefore in many cases dominates the behavior of the whole spectral function .",
    "this makes it very difficult to obtain a large enough pole contribution in eq.([eq : polecontr ] ) for establishing a valid borel window .",
    "it has thus been a very hard task to make a reliable prediction on the resonance @xmath6 .",
    "as discussed in the next section , this problem can be solved by a modification of the standard qcd sum rules technique , which consists of using , instead of a single correlator , the difference of two independent correlators to construct the sum rules .",
    "this will be our strategy in this paper .",
    "to carry out qcd sum rule calculations , one first has to construct appropriate operators , which carry the desired quantum numbers .",
    "these operators should be chosen to couple strongly to the state that one wants to investigate , although this is not always a trivial task .",
    "the interpolating fields that we use in the present study are described in this section .",
    "our general strategy is to assemble two independent operators for each quantum number and set up general interpolating fields by considering linear combinations of them .",
    "all the operators used in this study are built from two @xmath62 diquarks and an @xmath63 antiquark , so that their @xmath2 component on the operator level is as small as possible .",
    "we therefore hope that these operators only have a small overlap with the @xmath2 scattering states while they should couple strongly to the possible pentaquark resonance . for orientation ,",
    "the properties of the employed @xmath62 diquarks are given in table [ diquark ] .",
    ".the quantum numbers of the @xmath62 diquarks used in this study .",
    "@xmath64 are color indices and @xmath65 stands for the charge conjugation matrix . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the details of the results for the various quantum numbers have been presented in the last section . putting everything together ,",
    "these results can be summarized as in table [ results ] .",
    "a number of comments have to be made here .",
    "first of all , the statement  no state found below @xmath66 gev \" in table [ results ] means that either no valid borel window could be found or that the results of the sum rules did strongly depend on @xmath36 and @xmath32 and that therefore no evidence for a narrow ground state pole could be found . concerning this point , in the case of @xmath67 ,",
    "the results of the chiral - even sum rule and the parity - projected sum rule are to a certain extent contradictory and we therefore have to put a question mark behind this conclusion .",
    "furthermore , having found no narrow state in our sum rule calculation does not necessarily mean that such a state does not exist .",
    "it could happen that the spectral function is dominated by the @xmath2 scattering states and that the narrow states that we are looking for only couple weakly to the interpolating field that we have used .",
    "nevertheless , we have constructed general operators from linear combinations of two independent local operators , and have investigated all possible mixing angles and therefore the nonobservation of states shown in table [ results ] has been confirmed for quite a wide range of independent operators .",
    "next , we discuss the physical implications of the obtained results . a question that comes to one s mind",
    "when looking at table [ results ] is , why we can not observe @xmath68 states while we are seeing the ones with @xmath69 .",
    "these states are in some models considered to be spin - orbit partners @xcite , so if these models are realistic and consistent with qcd , we should be able to observe both of these states .",
    "there are at least two possible explanations for our obtained results .",
    "one explanation could be that the states with @xmath68 in fact exist , but their coupling to the used operators are too small and/or the @xmath2 scattering contribution is too large , so that a narrow peak structure can not be extracted .",
    "another possible interpretation of the missing @xmath68 states could be that , the spin - orbit partners of the spin @xmath18 states are not the ones with spin @xmath15 but with spin @xmath70 .",
    "this would mean that @xmath6 is indeed a very exotic state , as in this case the @xmath71 quarks have to form a spin 2 state , which would then couple to the remaining @xmath63 .",
    "this is of course only a very speculative picture , but it would be interesting to test it by calculating pentaquark states with spin @xmath70 .",
    "another important point , that needs to be discussed , is the interpretation of our results on the @xmath72 states .",
    "such a state was also found in a lattice study ( conducted only for the isosinglet state ) , where a resonance state was isolated from the @xmath2 scattering states @xcite .",
    "our results ( especially in the isosinglet case ) are somewhat ambiguous , and the errors are large , so it is difficult to draw any definite conclusions . in any case , whether such states turn out to be real pentaquark resonances or not , they most possibly do not correspond to the observed @xmath6 state , because @xmath72 states can decay into @xmath2 by an s - wave , for which the width is expected to be much larger than the observed value for @xmath9 , which is less than @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "of course , in principle there may exist some so far unknown mechanism , which suppresses the width strongly and which would allow to assign the @xmath72 quantum numbers to the @xmath9 , but with our present knowledge and experience , this seems to be unlikely .",
    "we conclude from our results summarized in table [ results ] that the most probable quantum number candidate for @xmath6 is @xmath73 . we have also found evidence for an isotriplet state @xmath74 and two states with spin @xmath15 ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) at slightly higher energy .    to obtain these results ,",
    "we have employed the qcd sum rule method , whose reliability is improved by analyzing the difference of two independent correlators , by which the contribution of the high - energy continuum states is suppressed . furthermore , by calculating the ope up to dimension 14 it is made sure that the expansion is converging well , and a valid borel window can be established .    considering the spin @xmath15 states , although we could observe some evidence for resonance states with @xmath67 and @xmath77 in the region of @xmath78 , we have pointed out that the situation concerning the @xmath2 scattering states does not seem to be very clear and our predictive power is quantitatively very limited .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in the previous section , we do not believe that these states correspond to @xmath6 , because their width is expected to be too large to be consistent with the experimental value .",
    "looking at the states with @xmath73 and @xmath74 , in both cases the values of the masses and residues show only a weak dependence on the borel mass @xmath36 and the threshold parameter @xmath32 . for the isosinglet case",
    "this was already pointed out in @xcite .",
    "this suggests that we are really observing narrow resonance states in the spectral functions of these quantum numbers .",
    "as no isospin partners of the @xmath6 have so far been found , it is believed to be an isosinglet , which leads to our conclusion that the @xmath6is likely to be a state with quantum numbers @xmath73 .",
    "the isotriplet state @xmath74 is predicted to exist somewhere above the isosinglet , so it may be interesting for future experiments to look for this state .",
    "one nevertheless has to be cautious when interpreting the current results , as we can not make any real quantitative prediction about the width of the state with the present method .",
    "therefore it is difficult to say whether the predicted isotriplet state is narrow enough to be unambiguously detected in an experiment .",
    "the width of a state can be obtained from the qcd sum rule technique by calculating three - point functions of appropriate currents , and it would be interesting to see whether it is possible to obtain a value consistent with experiment for the @xmath3 state and whether the @xmath79 state is really narrow enough to be experimentally observed .",
    "furthermore , it is important to check whether our conjecture of the large widths of the @xmath72 states is really true or not .",
    "these issues are left for further studies .",

    "<S> the qcd sum rule technique is employed to investigate pentaquark states with strangeness @xmath0 and @xmath1 . throughout the calculation </S>",
    "<S> , emphasis is laid on the establishment of a valid borel window , which corresponds to a region of the borel mass , where the operator product expansion converges and the presumed ground state pole dominates the sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> such a borel window is achieved by constructing the sum rules from the difference of two independent correlators and by calculating the operator product expansion up to dimension 14 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we discuss the possibility of the contamination of the sum rules by possible @xmath2 scattering states . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that the @xmath3 state seems to be the most probable candidate for the experimentally observed @xmath4 , while we also obtain states with @xmath5 at somewhat higher mass regions . </S>"
