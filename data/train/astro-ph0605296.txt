    "galaxy redshift surveys such as the 2dfgrs ( colless et al . 2001 ) or the sloan digital sky survey ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) and n  body simulations of cosmic structure formation ( for example springel et al . 2005 and references therein ) demonstrate the existence of a complicated network of matter . at the most prominent positions in this network , massive clusters of galaxies can be found , which are interconnected by filaments and , to a lesser degree , sheets . in both observations and simulations clusters",
    "are aspherical systems , a fact which has lead to investigations of the degree and origin of asphericity and of possible alignments between neighbouring objects . in this paper",
    "we use an n  body simulation of a @xmath0cdm universe to study the link between this network of structure and the shapes and alignments of galaxies and clusters .",
    "binggeli ( 1982 ) first investigated the alignment of galaxy clusters , finding that for the 44 abell clusters in a sample there was a strong longitudinal alignment signal ( clusters tend to point towards each other , the `` binggeli effect '' ) .",
    "this was seen for cluster - cluster separations of up to @xmath1 15 @xmath2 mpckm / sec / mpc . ] .",
    "most follow  up studies , optical and otherwise , have confirmed binggeli s results ( flin 1987 , rhee & katgert 1987 , west 1989 , rhee et al .",

    "( 2005 ) , and basilakos et al .",
    "sized halos also have a strong tendency to be aligned in the same direction as other nearby halos ( see e.g. heavens , refregier & heymans 2000 , croft & metzler 2000 ) , as well as pointing along the direction vector to nearby halos ( e.g. , li & croft 2005 ) .",
    "this latter signal , the intrinsic density  shear correlation has been recently seen in observational galaxy data by mandelbaum ( 2005 ) , and agustsson & brainerd ( 2005 ) .",
    "it is not immediately obvious what causes the alignment of halos .",
    "as shown in van haarlem & van de weygaert ( 1993 ) , clusters tend to orient themselves toward the direction of the last matter infall ( as shown in colberg et al .",
    "1999 , matter falls into cluster predominantly from filaments ) .",

    "they find that as the number density rises , so does the average cluster alignment .",
    "while this indicates that filaments between clusters might cause increased alignment , for a more general analysis it is necessary to investigate cluster samples for which the inter - cluster filaments are found with reference to the density field itself .",
    "such a set of filaments would also make possible an investigation of shapes and alignments of halos much smaller than galaxy clusters .",
    "colberg et al .",
    "( 2005 ) investigated inter ",
    "cluster configurations of matter in a high  resolution simulation of cosmic structure and found a complete set of filaments . here",
    "we will use their data as the basis for a detailed investigation of the connection between large  scale structure and halo alignments .",
    "in particular , we will investigate whether there is a connection between the alignment of pairs of clusters and the existence ( or non  existence ) of a filament between them .",
    "we will also study whether halos of mass smaller than that of a massive cluster are aligned with filaments and/or the tidal fields of the clusters .",
    "the latter is interesting in the light of an algorithm proposed by pimbblet ( 2005 ) to locate filaments in galaxy redshift catalogues .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section  [ simulation ]",
    "we describe the simulation , in section  [ alignments ] we study the alignments of halos between pairs of clusters connected by filaments or with voids in between them , and in section  [ ellip ] , we briefly re  visit ellipticities of halos .",
    "section  [ summary ] contains a summary and discussion .",
    "we make use of the high  resolution @xmath0cdm simulation introduced in jenkins et al .",
    "the simulation parameters ( @xmath3 = 0.3 , @xmath0 = 0.7 , @xmath4 = 0.7 , and @xmath5 = 0.9 ) are in good agreement with the currently accepted standard cosmology ( colless et al . 2001 , spergel et al . 2003 , seljak et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the simulation follows the evolution of 256@xmath6 dark matter particles in a cubical volume of size ( 141.3@xmath2mpc)@xmath6 on a side , resulting in a particle mass of @xmath7 .",
    "the group catalogue is obtained by running a standard friends  of  friends group finder on the full particle set , using a linking length of @xmath8 times the mean interparticle separation .",
    "we use all groups with 50 particles or more for the analysis , which results in a total sample of 17461 halos .",
    "our choice of the minimum halo mass is motivated by the fact that for less than 50 particles , the structure of a halo can not be reliably determined ( see e.g. the tests in kasun & evrard 2004 ) . in the following , we will refer to the 170 most massive groups as clusters and to all others as halos .",
    "the cluster sample was designed to match the space density of abell clusters as outlined in colberg et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    for each halo",
    ", we compute its principal axes by diagonalizing the moment of inertia tensor @xmath9 where the sum is over all particles in the halo , and the coordinates are defined with respect to the center of mass of the group .",
    "the resulting eigenvalues @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are sorted by size , in descending order .",
    "the ellipticity of a group is then defined by @xmath13      we make use of the filament catalogue described by colberg et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . in that paper , intercluster filaments were found by investigating the configuration of matter between neighbouring clusters .",
    "the mass distributions between all pairs of clusters ( up to the 12th nearest neighbour of each cluster ) were projected onto orthogonal planes .",
    "the results were then visually classified according to the appearance of the projections ( essentially into either a filament , absence of a structure , or rarely , a sheet ) .",
    "we will use the colberg ( 2005 ) classifications to examine alignments of halos and clusters with the cluster ",
    "cluster axes , and how it depends on the presence of a filaments ..    figure  [ fig : image ] shows a small piece of the simulation volume , with halos being plotted as ellipsoids . the ellipsoids are scaled according to their mass , and the orientations of the ellipsoids correspond to those of the actual mass distributions .",

    "the same filament is shown bottom ",
    "center in figure  1 of colberg et al .",
    "the filament is clearly visible , although any coherent alignments of the halos is difficult to pick out by eye .",

    "cc                cc                cc",
    "for each cluster pair , we examine the halos that lie in the cylinder whose central axis is defined by the cluster  cluster axis and whose radius extends 70@xmath2mpc from the cluster  cluster axis . by going out to these large radii",
    "we cover as much of the simulation volume for each cluster pair as possible .",
    "we define two vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that @xmath14 lies on the cluster  cluster axis , and",
    "@xmath15 points along one of the halo principal axes .",

    "fig : halo - fil - perpd - align ] , we plot the alignments of the principal axes of the halos with the cluster ",
    "cluster axis as a function of the perpendicular distance from that axis .",
    "the rows show the major , intermediate , and minor axes . in the leftmost , center , and rightmost columns we plot alignments of halos , of halos plus clusters , and of clusters , respectively .",
    "cluster pairs which are connected by a filament are shown using squares , whereas asterisks are used for cluster pairs for which no coherent structure was found along the cluster  cluster axis .",

    "cluster axis , the major and minor axes of halos are aligned and anti  aligned with that axis , respectively ( leftmost column of figure  [ fig : halo - fil - perpd - align ] ) .",
    "interestingly , there is no clear difference between those cluster pairs that are connected by a filament and those that are not connected at all . for galaxy ",
    "size halos therefore the fact that they lie in a filament or not does not affect their alignments ( we will examine the effect on their ellipticities in section 4.2 ) .",
    "the alignment signals become small at larger separations from the cluster  cluster axis . at separations of around 4@xmath2mpc",
    "the alignment signal is almost absent . as can be seen from figure  8 in colberg et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , at this scale , the averaged density profile of filaments has dropped strongly from its central value .",
    "however , given that we do not find a difference in the alignments between connected and unconnected cluster pairs , this finding has to be treated as a mere coincidence .",
    "we note that the ( anti ) alignment signal is somewhat stronger for the minor axes than for major axes .",
    "also , for the minor axes , there is a small difference between halos in filaments and halos elsewhere , although the error bars are relatively large .",
    "the intermediate halo axes are neither aligned nor anti  aligned with the cluster  cluster axes .",

    "the major and minor axes of the clusters connected by filaments are aligned and anti  aligned with those filaments , respectively .",
    "although the statistical uncertainty is quite large , the signal is significantly stronger than for galaxy  size halos .",
    "however , no such signal exists for cluster pairs that are not connected by filaments , which again is very different from the galaxy halo result .",

    "cluster axes , we now turn our attention to the dependence of any alignment signal on the distance of a halo from its nearest cluster , i.e. along the cluster  cluster axis .",
    "we restrict this analysis to all halos that are within 1.5@xmath2mpc from the axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : halo - fil - projd - align ] shows the alignments for the three halo axes , both for halos ( top row ) and for halos plus clusters ( bottom row ) .",
    "the symbols are the same as in figure  [ fig : halo - fil - perpd - align ] .",
    "we scale the halo  cluster separations on the @xmath18axis such that a halo position just outside the virial radius of the nearest cluster is at position 0 , whereas a halo right in the center between both clusters sits is at position 1 .",
    "@xmath19 is the total length of a cluster ",
    "cluster axis , and @xmath20 corresponds to the distance of a halo from the nearer one of the clusters that define the cluster  cluster axis .",
    "as before , the dotted line shows the expectation for a random sample with no alignments .",
    "figure  [ fig : halo - fil - projd - align ] shows that the magnitude of the alignments does not depend on the distance of a halo from the nearest cluster .",
    "there also is no difference between cluster pairs that are connected by a filament and those that intersect a void .",
    "cc                cc                  the presence of tidal fields can provide a very natural explanation for the alignments and shapes of objects . in the following sections",
    ", we will study the influence of the tidal forces exterted by the clusters that are used to define the cluster  cluster configurations .      in order to make a simple model of the tidal field , we treat the two clusters as spherical objects and we ignore the mass contained in the filaments .",
    "given the large masses of the clusters and the relatively low average overdensity of filaments ( see the discussion in colberg et al .",
    "2005 ) this simple model is reasonable .    for this dumbell",
    " shaped configuration , use of an analytical expression for the gravitational potential is possible .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath21 ) and take one of the clusters to lie at the origin with the other one on the @xmath22axis .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath23 then becomes @xmath24 where @xmath19 is the the length of the cluster ",
    "cluster axis , and the masses of the two clusters are given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the components of the tidal field tensor @xmath27 can be computed through @xmath28 since we are only interested in the absolute magnitude of the tidal field components we neglect the sign , thus taking the absolute value to be a measure of the stretching a body would feel .    in this axially symmetric model ,",
    "there are two components of @xmath29 that stretch a spherical mass into an ellipse .",
    "they are @xmath30 } { [ \\rho^2+(l - z)^2]^{5/2 } }   - \\frac { m_1 ( \\rho^2 - 2z^2 ) } { ( \\rho^2+z^2)^{5/2 } } \\\\ \\mbox{and}\\nonumber\\\\ t_{\\rho\\rho } & = &   \\frac { m_1 ( 2\\rho^2-z^2 ) } { ( \\rho^2+z^2)^{5/2 } } - \\frac{m_2 [ ( l - z)^2 - 2\\rho^2]}{[\\rho^2+(l - z)^2]^{5/2 } }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath31 stretches along the cluster  cluster axis , whereas @xmath32 stretches perpendicular to the cluster ",
    "cluster axis .",
    "we normalize the tidal field components by dividing them by the strength of the tidal field of a milky  way size halo with @xmath33 at a radius of @xmath34mpc .",
    "we use a procedure similar to the one previously outlined to compute the alignments , as follows . to study @xmath32 , we take @xmath14 to be perpendicular to the cluster  cluster axis and pointing towards the halo and @xmath15 along one of the principal axes of the halo as before .      figure  [ fig : tidal - align ] shows the alignments for the two tidal  field components @xmath31 and @xmath32 . as before , the leftmost , center , and rightmost columns show the major , intermediate , and minor halo axes , respectively .",
    "the two rows give the alignments along @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in each plot",
    ", the dotted line shows the expectation for a random sample with no alignments .",
    "the stretching perpendicular to the cluster ",
    "cluster axis is about twice that parallel to the cluster ",
    "cluster axis .",
    "we note that for this analysis we do not differentiate between cluster pairs with filaments or voids in between .",
    "this also results in smaller error bars , since the sample sizes are bigger .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is smaller than alignments discussed in the previous sections .",
    "however , unlike the alignment as a function of distance from the cluster - cluster axis , the alignment with the tidal field is a much more abrupt function of tidal field strength . from figure",
    "[ fig : tidal - align ] we can see that when the tidal field is less than @xmath35 of the mw field the results are statistically consistent with no alignment .",
    "the sudden change for larger values of the tidal field indicates the direct role that tidal distortions must play in aligning halos .        cc",
    "in the light of the results obtained so far , in particular the alignment signals and their dependence on the distance from cluster  cluster axes , it is worthile to examine ellipticities of the halos .",
    "figure  [ fig : ellip - mass ] shows the ellipticities of the halos and clusters in our sample as a function of their mass .",
    "the error bars assume poissonian distributions .",
    "there is a trend for more massive clusters to be more elliptical than smaller halos , although the sample size is small .",
    "this finding agrees with the results obtained by e.g. warren et al .",
    "1992 .",
    "figure  [ fig : halo - fil - perpd - align ] shows that the alignment of halos with a cluster ",
    "cluster axis depends on the distance from that axis .",
    "it is thus interesting to see whether the ellipticities are correlated with that distance as well .",
    "figure  [ fig : ellip - perpd ] shows halo and cluster ellipticities as a function of the distance from cluster  cluster axes .",
    "shown are all halos ( left column ) , all halos plus the clusters ( center column ) , and only the 170 clusters ( right column ) .",
    "square and asterisk symbols denote groups associated with cluster pairs conncected by a filament or with a void in between them , respectively .    from the figure",
    "we see that within the errors there is no correlation between the ellipticities and the distance of the galaxy halos from from the cluster",
    " cluster axes .",
    "if tidal forces are responsible for the alignments , they do not cause a difference in the overall shape of halos .",
    "furthermore , we also find that there is no difference between halos lying along the axes of cluster pairs connected by a filament and those cluster pairs which have a void in between them .",
    "many studies of the alignments of galaxy clusters have been carried out both with observational data ( binggeli 1982 , struble & peebles 1985 , flin 1987 , rhee & katgert 1987 , ulmer et al . 1989 ,",
    "west 1989 , rhee et al .",
    "1992 , plionis 1994 , west et al .",
    "1995 , chambers et al . 2000 and 2002 ) and theoretically ( splinter et al .",
    "1997 , onuora & thomas 2000 , faltenbacher et al .",
    "2002 , kasun & evrard 2004 , hopkins et al .",
    "2005 , basilakos et al .",
    "most observations and all theoretical studies indicate that neighbouring galaxy clusters indeed appear to be aligned , with some uncertainties due to the facts that shapes of clusters are notoriously hard to measure observationally , and that the simulations used for the theoretical studies follow the evolution of the dark matter , which may or may not trace the distribution of the galaxies used to define observational cluster shapes .",
    "the causes of such an alignment are not clear . both infall of material ( van haarlem & van de weygaert 1993 ) and tidal fields ( bond et al .",
    "1996 ; also see lee et al .",
    "2005a , 2005b ) have been suggested as explanations .    as shown in colberg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the formation of clusters happens along filaments ( also compare the recent direct observations of this process for the @xmath36 cluster clj0152.71357 in maughan et al .",
    "2005 and tanaka et al . 2005 ) .",
    "if the infall of material causes alignments of clusters , then the presence of filaments is a prerequisite for alignments to exist .",
    "we have investigated this scenario by studying the alignments of neighbouring clusters , separating cluster pairs into those that are connected by a filament and those that are not . for this study , we have made use of the filaments identified in colberg et al .",
    "as the rightmost column of figure  [ fig : halo - fil - perpd - align ] shows , there is a clear difference between the two cases .",
    "clusters connected by a filament are clearly aligned , whereas unconnected ones are not .",
    "on the basis of this result it appears the binggeli effect can be explained by the presence of filaments , along which material falls into the clusters .",
    "note that this result provides another indicator of the likely presence of filaments .",
    "as colberg et al .",
    "( 2005 ) indicated , close pairs of clusters are candidates for the presence of a filament in between them .",
    "the presence of alignment of the clusters adds another strong indicator",
    ". however , given the difficulties involved when measuring cluster shapes , this theoretical prediction might not be much help in practice .",
    "it must be stressed that the presence of filaments does not mean that tidal fields play no role whatsoever in the process of aligning the halos of galaxy clusters or of galaxies themselves . as can be seen from the leftmost column of figure  [ fig : halo - fil - perpd - align ] , while filaments cause alignments of cluster  size halos , they have no discernible influence on smaller halos . an alternative way to phrase",
    "this result is to say that halos of galaxies being aligned has nothing to do with whether those halos are embedded in a filament or not .",
    "there also is no dependence of the alignments of galaxy size halos on their distance from the nearest cluster , as shown in figure  [ fig : halo - fil - projd - align ] .",
    "a somewhat esoteric question which one can ask is whether the strong alignments of halos seen in simulations by e.g. heavens et al ( 2000 ) , croft & metzler ( 2000 ) are due to halos being formed largely in filaments and being aligned with the filament direction . in this case",
    "one would expect halos to be aligned with each other as a result . in this study , we have found , however that halos are aligned with each other whether they fall in a filament or not , so that this explanation is not valid .",
    "the tidal field around each galaxy sized halo has a much more direct impact on the alignments of the halos .",
    "we have investigated the contribution of tidal fields by modeling the tidal field of a pair of clusters analytically as a simple model of two spherical masses .",
    "figure  [ fig : tidal - align ] shows the alignments for the two tidal  field components @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the stretching perpendicular to the cluster ",
    "cluster axis is about twice that parallel to the cluster ",
    "cluster axis .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is smaller than that of the alignment through filaments discussed above , but the abruptness of the increase in alignment signal once tidal fields become substantial leads one to the conclusion that tidal fields have a very direct influence on halo alignments .    in the light of the theoretical model of lee",
    "et al . ( 2005a , 2005b ) , it is interesting to study whether there exists a correlation of the magnitudes of the ellipticities of halos with large - scale structure .",
    "as we have already seen , the orientiations of the ellipticities are clearly influenced by tidal fields .",
    "figure  [ fig : ellip - perpd ] shows halo and cluster ellipticities as a function of the distance from cluster  cluster axes .",
    "there is no correlation between the ellipticities and the distance of the halos from the cluster  cluster axes , whether filament or void .",
    "furthermore , there is no difference between cluster pairs connected by a filament and those which have a void in between them .",
    "we are thus left to conclude that while the alignment of clusters is dominated by the infall of matter along filaments , for the vast majority of halos only tidal fields determine alignments of halos . as an aside",
    ", we note that this implies that pimbblet ( 2005 ) s filament finding mechanism which is based on using alignments to find filaments is unlikely to be successful .",
    "this judgment is however based on the assumption that the stellar parts of galaxies will align in a similar way to the dark matter , something which must be tested .",
