    "the wigner @xcite function @xmath0 is a representation of the quantum density operator @xmath1 as a real function on phase space , for a non - relativistic dynamical system with classical - quantum correspondence and @xmath2 degrees of freedom . here ,",
    "all the underlying geometry is euclidean and we can include the wigner function within the general framework of weyl representation of operators : @xmath3 , so @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes a point in phase space . in this context , the quantum evolution of the density operator @xmath6 effected by an autonomous external hamiltonian @xmath7 can be written in terms of its weyl @xcite representation as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the weyl symbol of @xmath7 and @xmath11 is the classical poisson bracket .    even though the wigner function @xmath0 is generally nonpositive and thus can not be taken as a classical probability density ( in contrast to its lagrangian averages @xmath12 , etc ... ) , equation ( [ ham ] )",
    "is the source of a somewhat widespread belief that the propagation of @xmath13 coincides in the semiclassical limit ( @xmath14 ) with the classical ( @xmath15 ) propagation of a liouville probability density .",
    "in fact , for a quadratic hamiltonian @xmath16 the semiclassical ( exact ) propagation of @xmath13 is indeed classical .",
    "that is , if @xmath17 is the classical hamiltonian flow generated by @xmath18 , then @xmath19 for a general hamiltonian @xmath7 ( whose weyl symbol @xmath10 does not necessarily coincide with the classical hamiltonian @xmath20 ) the classical propagation ( [ folk ] ) induced by ( [ ham ] ) remains a good approximation ( semiclassically correct ) if @xmath0 is a fairly smooth function ( as with the weyl representation of an observable ) , in which case the corrections to ( [ ham ] ) can be semiclassically ignored .",
    "such a smoothness condition can be realized for highly mixed statistical states , in which case @xmath0 will look very much like a classical probability density in phase space and not surprisingly its propagation will be nearly classical .    on the other hand ,",
    "pure states are not in general represented by smooth wigner functions .",
    "indeed , the semiclassical limit @xmath21 for the wigner function of a pure state @xmath22 in one degree of freedom @xcite is : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the symplectic area between an arc of a ( bohr - sommerfeld quantized ) curve @xmath25 and its corresponding chord centered at @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is a smooth amplitude function .",
    "such an expression for @xmath21 is highly oscillatory , specially at this semiclassical limit , and its successive derivatives knock off all the favorable powers of @xmath28 in the `` corrections '' to ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "the important exception is when @xmath26 lies very close to @xmath25 in which case @xmath24 is very close to zero and constant , and @xmath29 is locally smooth .",
    "however , the regions inside a closed leaf @xmath25 , where @xmath21 is highly oscillatory , are of utmost importance for they neatly exhibit the nonpositive and thus nonclassical aspect of @xmath0 which accounts for quantum interference and coherence phenomena .",
    "thus , ( [ folk ] ) provides an inadequate description of the propagation of wigner functions at the semiclassical level .",
    "most of these problems with the propagation of semiclassical wigner functions were already clearly discussed by heller @xcite in 1976 , even before the semiclassical approximations for @xmath0 were properly developed @xcite@xcite .",
    "the asymptotic expansion ( [ ham ] ) in @xmath28 was then partially resummed to obtain an improved propagation , though in a not very general context . from another approach , starting with the integral expression of the evolution equation , marinov @xcite derived in 1991 a path integral representation for the propagator of wigner functions , obtaining its semiclassical limit , which leads to ( [ folk ] ) . in this paper",
    "we develop the geometrical explanation of why the semiclassical limit of the propagation of wigner functions can not be derived from the semiclassical limit of their propagator .",
    "thus , in @xmath30 we present the integral equation for the wigner evolution , defining its kernel , the wigner propagator , whose stationary phase evaluation necessarily leads to classical propagation . then , in @xmath31 we recollect the constructions of semiclassical wigner functions which will permit , in @xmath32 , a correct stationary phase evaluation of the full integral equation for their evolution .",
    "this leads , in @xmath33 , to a simple geometrical prescription for the semiclassical limit of the propagation of a wigner function in terms of the classical flow of the tips of the chords centered on the arguments of the initial semiclassical wigner function .",
    "we conclude in @xmath34 with a discussion on the geometrical meaning of the difference between classical liouville and semiclassical wigner propagation .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the expression for the product of operators in the center ( or weyl ) representation .",
    "thus , if @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the center representations of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , then the center representation for @xmath39 is given @xcite@xcite by the integral moyal product : @xmath40(x ) = \\int dx ' dx '' a(x ' ) b(x '' ) exp(i\\delta(x , x',x'')/\\hbar ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the symplectic area of the triangle with these midpoints .",
    "iterating ( [ prod ] ) we obtain the integral equation for the evolution of wigner functions as the weyl transform of the quantum evolution equation @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the weyl propagator , i.e. the weyl transform of the unitary evolution operator @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46-function prescribes the 4 points in @xmath47 as vertices of a parallelogram .",
    "the phase is twice the area of this parallelogram ( times @xmath48 ) .",
    "but this is also the area of any element of a continuous family of quadrilaterals circumscribed to the given parallelogram . in other words",
    ", we can identify the symplectic area of the parallelogram with vertices at @xmath49 as half of the symplectic area of any quadrilateral whose sides are centered on these points .",
    "this brings the product rule for three operators in line with that for two operators and , indeed , the product of any number of operators will depend on the corresponding circumscribed polygon @xcite .",
    "thus , denoting by @xmath50 the area of a quadrilateral as function of its midpoints , we have that @xmath51 and this function is well defined only on the subset @xmath52 , isomorphic to @xmath53 , determined by the @xmath46-function .",
    "fixing one ( say , the first , @xmath26 ) of these points , we obtain a subset @xmath54 , isomorphic to @xmath55 . denoting its induced measure by @xmath56 ,",
    "we can rewrite ( [ tp1 ] ) as @xmath57 similarly , we can reparametrize the parallelogram by identifying : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , in which case we can use ( [ tp1 ] ) to get an expression for the wigner propagator or kernel @xmath61 , via its defining formula @xmath62 , in the following form : @xmath63    marinov @xcite has derived an explicit path integral representation for the wigner propagator @xmath61 .",
    "this can also be achieved by introducing in ( [ l ] ) the path integral representation @xcite for the weyl propagator @xmath44 . for this",
    "latter , there exists a well - established semiclassical limit @xcite@xcite : @xmath64 ( x ) \\right\\ } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the symplectic area between the classical trajectory @xmath66 ( determined by the weyl hamiltonian @xmath10 ) and the chord centered on @xmath26 , with @xmath67 being the energy of this trajectory , and where , again , @xmath68 is a slow - varying real amplitude function . for sufficiently small times we can guarantee the existence of a single trajectory .",
    "eventually there may be bifurcations , in which case ( [ scw ] ) must be replaced by a sum of similar terms with appropriate morse indices @xcite .",
    "the naive semiclassical limit for the propagation of wigner functions can be seen as a consequence of trying to get a semiclassical limit for the wigner propagator ( [ l ] ) itself by stationary phase , either via its path integral representation @xcite or directly by using ( [ scw ] ) .",
    "in any case we are lead to a semiclassical wigner propagator which is indeed classical , i.e. of the singular form : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the inverse of the classical hamiltonian flow of @xmath10 .",
    "obviously , ( [ naive ] ) implies ( [ folk ] ) .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the correct semiclassical limit for the propagation of wigner functions , one must apply stationary phase arguments to the full integral equation ( [ tp1]-[tp2 ] ) for the wigner evolution , using the correct semiclassical expressions for the wigner functions themselves .",
    "for one degree of freedom , the simple form of the semiclassical wigner function ( [ wig ] ) depends on there existing only a single chord centered on each point @xmath26 , besides the fulfilling of the semiclassical condition itself , i.e. the area @xmath24 being large in comparison to planck s constant @xmath28 .",
    "these conditions hold for points not too close to a convex leaf ( curve ) @xmath25 , outside the cusped triangular curve well in the interior of @xmath25 known as the wigner caustic @xcite . inside the caustic",
    "there are three chords centered on each point and the semiclassical wigner function becomes a superposition of contributions of the same form as ( [ wig ] ) , one for each chord and its associated area . along the wigner caustic itself , two chords coalesce and the amplitude in ( [ wig ] ) , defined as : @xmath71 blows up .",
    "here , @xmath72 is the classical frequency of motion along the curve @xmath25 , whereas @xmath73 are the phase space velocities at the tips @xmath74 of the corresponding chord centered on @xmath26 .",
    "the wigner caustic is hence the locus of the centers of the chords between points on @xmath25 with parallel or anti - parallel tangents .",
    "the caustic condition thus leads to the vanishing of the skew - product @xmath75 and since this also happens when @xmath26 converges onto @xmath25 , this latter can be considered as a separate branch of the wigner caustic , i.e. the breakdown of ( [ wig ] ) also takes place on @xmath25 itself .",
    "berry @xcite derived a uniform approximation based on the airy function that is also oscillatory and asymptotically equivalent to ( [ wig ] ) inside @xmath25 , rises to a smooth maximum near to this curve and decays exponentially outside .",
    "the same picture holds for integrable systems with @xmath76 degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the novelty is that the caustic still has codimension @xmath77 , so the invariant @xmath76-torus arises as a higher singularity or catastrophe of the wigner caustic .",
    "another important feature is that multiple chords may be centered on points that lie arbitrarily close to the invariant torus .",
    "still , sufficiently far within the energy - shell we retrieve the asymptotic form @xcite@xcite @xmath78 where again the actions @xmath79 are bounded by the @xmath80-th chord centered at @xmath26 and any arc on the quantized torus ( again a lagrangian leaf ) between the chord tips .",
    "the amplitudes are now given by @xmath81^{-1/2 }   \\ , \\ ] ] and @xmath82 is the signature of the matrix in ( [ mamp ] ) . here , the @xmath83 action functions @xmath84 are defined in terms of the @xmath76 action functions @xmath85 as @xmath86 . note that if @xmath87 ( [ mamp ] ) is identical with ( [ amp ] ) .",
    "no immediate generalization of the semiclassical expression for pure - state wigner function is available for chaotic or general nonintegrable systems .",
    "however , the superposition of pure wigner functions in a classically narrow energy range @xmath88 determines the spectral wigner function @xmath89 which has the now familiar semiclassical limit @xcite@xcite @xmath90   \\ , \\ ] ] where again @xmath79 is the symplectic area between a chord centered on @xmath26 and a classical path between the chord tips . in this case , this is an arc of a classical trajectory along the energy shell , traversed in the time @xmath91 . for @xmath26 close to the energy shell , the chords are all small and",
    "there is one arc traversed in a small time and a succession of longer arcs winding around the energy shell .",
    "moving the center @xmath26 leads to the crossing of many wigner caustics where pairs of chords coalesce and disappear or vice versa . along these caustics",
    ", one can again implement uniform approximations which coincide , off - caustics , with the sum ( [ spcw ] ) in which the amplitude for each chord is @xmath92 | \\right\\}^{-1/2 }   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the matrix for the linearized classical map near the @xmath80-th trajectory arc on a special @xmath94-dimensional section that is centro - symmetric with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "thus we have a persistent overall picture : superposition of rapidly oscillating functions with wave vectors @xmath95 $ ] , where @xmath96 is the standard symplectic matrix in @xmath97 , and amplitudes depending only on the relation between the velocity vectors at the tips of each respective chord .",
    "having recollected the general form of the semiclassical expressions for the various kinds of wigner functions , we are now in a position to correctly approximate ( [ tp1]-[tp2 ] ) by stationary phase . the crucial point here is how to _ geometrically _ interpret formulas ( [ tp1]-[tp2 ] ) in the semiclassical approximation . as mentioned earlier , the phase of the exponential in the integrand , which is twice the area of the parallelogram ( times @xmath48 ) , corresponds to the area of _ any _ quadrilateral circumscribed to this parallelogram .",
    "furthermore , recall from the previous section that the argument @xmath26 of the semiclassical wigner function ( [ wig],[mwig],[spcw ] ) corresponds to the center of the chord whose tips lie on the energy shell or the lagrangian leaf @xmath25 corresponding to the quantum state @xmath22 , so that the phase of its oscillatory factor corresponds to the symplectic area between @xmath25 and the chord centered on @xmath26 ( minus @xmath98 ) . on the other hand , the semiclassical weyl propagator ( [ scw ] ) also has a phase corresponding to the symplectic area between the classical trajectory @xmath66 and the chord centered on @xmath26 ( minus @xmath99 ) .",
    "therefore , all the semiclassical terms of the integrand in ( [ tp1]-[tp2 ] ) have oscillatory factors whose phases depend on the chords centered on their arguments .",
    "this suggests interpreting the phase @xmath50 of the integrator in ( [ tp1]-[tp2 ] ) as the area of the circumscribed quadrilateral that _ fits _ all the pertinent chords discussed above . to be totally consistent",
    ", such fitting must take into account all the correct orientations , so that one should first dismember the wigner function as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 , and propagate each member separately , then add them up for the total evolution of @xmath21 .",
    "the situation for a single degree of freedom is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "stationary phase condition for the propagation of wigner functions .",
    "1.a : single degree of freedom",
    ". the various chords of @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath66 and @xmath104    centered on @xmath105 , @xmath26 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively , match perfectly with the quadrilateral    whose sides are centered on these points to yield , via eq.@xmath108 , the area between @xmath25    and the chord centered on @xmath26 , the phase of the propagated wigner function at @xmath26 .",
    "1.b : the same situation but with all the orientations reversed .",
    "the really important issue is that these perfect matchings correspond precisely to the stationary phase condition , as we now show .",
    "let us concentrate on the configuration in fig.1.a , corresponding to the semiclassical evolution of @xmath109 , determined by the leaf @xmath110 , via formulas ( [ tp1]-[tp2 ] ) .",
    "the same analysis holds for the other case ( fig.1.b ) as well as more dimensions . inserting expressions ( [ wig ] ) and ( [ scw ] ) for @xmath111 and @xmath112 in ( [ tp2 ] )",
    ", we obtain : @xmath113 @xmath114(x ' ) + s_{\\psi ' ' } ( x '' ) -\\pi\\hbar /4",
    "+ [ s_{\\gamma_t } - e_{\\gamma_t}t](x ' '' ) + \\delta_4 ( x , x',x'',x ' '' ) \\ .",

    "\\frac{\\partial [ s_{\\gamma_t } - e_{\\gamma_t}t]}{\\partial x ' '' }   =        -   \\frac{\\partial\\delta_4 } { \\partial x ' '' } \\ \\ .\\ ] ] these equations mean @xcite that the side of the quadrilateral @xmath50 whose midpoint is @xmath105 coincides with the chord of @xmath117 centered on @xmath105 , with the same orientation as @xmath110 .",
    "this is the chord from @xmath118 to @xmath119 in fig(1.a ) .",
    "similarly for the other cases , the side of @xmath50 centered on @xmath107 is the chord connecting @xmath120 to @xmath118 and the side of @xmath50 centered on @xmath106 is the chord connecting @xmath119 to @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , the stationary phase condition coincides with the perfectly matching scenario .",
    "furthermore , note that @xmath122 is the area of the `` curvilinear '' quadrilateral which is formed by the paths @xmath110 , @xmath66 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , where @xmath25 is the immage of @xmath102 under the hamiltonian flow for a time @xmath123 .",
    "it follows by direct geometrical inspection on the perfectly matching configuration that @xmath124 t \\   = \\",
    "s_{\\psi}(x ) \\ \\big\\}_{match}\\ ] ] and thus @xmath125 . and of course ,",
    "@xmath126 .",
    "therefore , we retrieve a new wigner function @xmath127 whose phase is of the same general form given in ( [ wig],[mwig],[spcw ] ) for @xmath128 , in terms of the new action @xmath24 .",
    "of course , this is just as we should expect within the general rules of semiclassical self - consistency in which all integrations are carried out within the stationary phase approximation .",
    "it should now be feasible to proceed with the full stationary phase evaluation of ( [ w+ ] ) for each of the different types of wigner functions ( [ wig],[mwig],[spcw ] ) previously described , using the semiclassical expression @xcite@xcite for the amplitude @xmath129 of the weyl propagator .",
    "such a thorough verification of semiclassical self - consistency has already been carried out @xcite for the pure state condition @xmath130 .",
    "it relies on such complicated geometrical constructions that we consider more appropriate , at this point , to just assume semiclassical self - consistency for the propagated amplitudes , as well .",
    "accordingly , each semiclassically propagated wigner function @xmath128 retains its respective form ( [ wig],[mwig],[spcw ] ) , with its corresponding amplitude function ( [ amp],[mamp],[spamp ] ) .",
    "the beautiful consequence of this natural result is that it is sufficient to propagate the two tips of the chord of the original wigner function @xmath111 , centered on @xmath131 , in order to obtain the value of the new wigner function @xmath128 at @xmath132 .",
    "then , using ( [ proph ] ) we obtain the new phase @xmath133 from @xmath134 .",
    "similarly for the amplitudes , the actions @xmath135 and @xmath136 determine the matrices @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the linearized classical maps from @xmath139 to @xmath140 and from @xmath141 to @xmath142 , respectively , by @xcite @xmath143[1 + j(\\d^2\\mathcal{s}_{\\gamma_{\\pm t}}(y_{\\pm})/\\d y_{\\pm}^2)]^{-1 }   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",
    "hence , the corresponding phase - space velocity vectors for the tips of the propagated chord are obtained from the original ones by @xmath146 which gives the new amplitudes @xmath147 from @xmath148 via their defining equations ( [ amp],[mamp],[spamp ] ) . when the central action @xmath149 or @xmath150 goes through a caustic , one may rely on the chord actions @xmath151 or @xmath152 instead , for @xmath153 , where the chord actions are the legendre transform of the central actions : @xmath154 , to get @xcite @xmath155[1 - j(\\d^2\\tilde{\\mathcal{s}}_{\\gamma_{\\pm t}}(\\xi_{\\pm})/\\d \\xi_{\\pm}^2)]^{-1 }   \\ .\\ ] ] note , however , that in this case one must be very careful in correctly counting the maslov indices",
    ".    therefore , our analysis clearly leads to interpreting the correct point - to - point propagation of a semiclassical wigner function as given by the simple geometrical picture : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the midpoint of @xmath158 , while @xmath159 stands for the tips of the original chord centered on @xmath160 .",
    "this prescription based on the tips - of - the - chord flow provides a precise semiclassical evaluation of @xmath161 from @xmath162 .",
    "specifically , ( [ proph ] ) is used to propagate the phase of @xmath21 along the path @xmath163 . for short times",
    ", the smooth amplitude may be taken as approximately constant along this path , as illustrated below . for longer times",
    "the amplitude must also be properly propagated along this path via ( [ m]-[m2 ] ) . in this way , ( [ corr ] ) is straightforwardly used to obtain a quantitatively precise semiclassical propagation of @xmath21 `` mostly everywhere '' .",
    "but , wherever @xmath128 goes through an inner wigner caustic , its analysis must be carefully completed by uniform approximations",
    ". even then ( [ corr ] ) provides most valuable information because ( [ m]-[m2 ] ) can be used to determine these inner wigner caustic points and ( [ proph ] ) determine the contributing new phases which , from the knowledge of the corresponding caustics and uniform approximations for @xmath111 and after a careful qualitative analysis of the flow @xmath164 , can lead to the correct ( airy , pearcey ...",
    "@xcite ) functions representing @xmath128 in these regions .",
    "the on - shell wigner caustics are quite simpler to deal with because there @xmath165 and ( [ corr ] ) coincides with ( [ folk ] ) .",
    "thus , we can say that ( [ corr ] ) is quantitatively precise `` mostly everywhere '' and qualitatively precise everywhere , at the semiclassical level .    as a simple partial illustration of the method ,",
    "consider the hamiltonian @xmath166 .",
    "operator ordering is not relevant , modulo a constant , and @xmath167 .",
    "the trajectories are circles around the origin , but @xmath168 so the classical flow of @xmath169 is @xmath170 . if @xmath160 is the center of the chord whose tips , lying on @xmath171 , are @xmath172 , @xmath173 , then the new center @xmath174 of @xmath175 is given by @xmath176 , @xmath177 , with @xmath178 . thus , not only @xmath179 , but also @xmath180 .    despite the oddity of this flow ,",
    "@xmath161 is mostly everywhere obtained from @xmath162 in a straightforward manner from the knowledge of @xmath181 .",
    "hence , modulo nontrivial maslov changes , the phase difference @xmath182 independs on @xmath171 or @xmath111 and is ( via ( [ proph ] ) ) given by : @xmath183 on the other hand , the new amplitude depends on the velocities of the tips of the chord determined by @xmath171 and thus depends on @xmath171 and @xmath111 itself in an intrinsic way .",
    "however , for short enough times such that @xmath157 is not too different from @xmath184 , we can approximate the slow - varying amplitude by @xmath185 , `` using '' ( [ folk ] ) in a more justified way . together with ( [ difase ] )",
    "this gives a first approximation for the semiclassical propagation of _ any _ wigner function , mostly everywhere and for short times , under the @xmath186 hamiltonian .",
    "for longer times , we obtain @xmath187 from @xmath188 via ( [ amp ] ) and ( [ popvel ] ) , with @xmath189 determined by ( [ m ] ) from @xmath190/4 $ ] with @xmath191 , and by ( [ m2 ] ) from the corresponding @xmath192 . as for formula ( [ folk ] ) ,",
    "again the precise error will depend on @xmath171 and @xmath160 , but if @xmath160 is far from the leaf @xmath171 , we can approximate @xmath193 .",
    "thus , for any pair @xmath194 such that @xmath195 and @xmath196 differ significantly , ( [ folk ] ) can be considerably wrong even for a short time propagation .",
    "we have shown that the propagation of a semiclassical wigner function is correctly determined by the classical flow of the _ tips _ of the chord whose center is the argument of the initial wigner function , not by the classical flow of the argument itself .",
    "this reveals the irrelevance of the semiclassical limit for the wigner propagator .",
    "accordingly , in evaluating the integral equation for the evolution of a wigner function , we found that satisfying the stationary phase condition was tantamount to matching four areas around an appropriate quadrilateral .",
    "however , by reducing the propagation to a single trajectory , traversed in positive and negative time , the side of the quadrilateral facing the chord of the wigner function shrinks to a point and so it could only be matched by a zero length chord .",
    "thus we found that the relevant trajectories for a precise semiclassical propagation are explicitly determined by the specific semiclassical wigner function being propagated .",
    "indeed , one way to correctly evolve a semiclassical wigner function @xmath111 determined by a leaf @xmath171 in phase space is to classically evolve @xmath171 via the hamiltonian flow : @xmath164 and then evaluate the new semiclassical wigner function @xmath128 at each point from the knowledge of @xmath197 via ( [ wig],[amp]-[spamp ] ) , as shown in @xcite .",
    "thus , to obtain the value of the new semiclassical wigner function @xmath128 at @xmath26 one needs to know , at the very least , the corresponding chord of @xmath197 centered on @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , our analysis shows that the knowledge of the flow of each pair of points in @xmath171 is sufficient to determine the evolved semiclassical wigner function @xmath128 at all points .",
    "though these two prescriptions for the evolution of @xmath21 are equivalent , in practice the semiclassical point - to - point propagation of @xmath21 is often simpler to determine , both qualitatively and quantitatively , by ( [ proph]-[m2 ] ) via tips - of - the - chord flow ( [ corr ] ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "a mere knowledge of the hamiltonian flow of an argument of @xmath111 is not enough to reconstruct the new chord and hence the new value of @xmath128 .",
    "the exceptions are either linear flow or when the two tips of the corresponding chord coalesce into its center , in other words , when the argument of @xmath111 lies on the leaf @xmath171 . for these points",
    "the total chord flow coincides with the center flow , thus ( [ folk ] ) is verified in the regions of high amplitude near the leaf @xmath171 , but not otherwise for nonlinear flows .",
    "it is easy to see why : the phase of @xmath162 corresponds to the symplectic area between @xmath171 and the chord centered on @xmath160 . under a nonlinear hamiltonian flow ,",
    "the symplectic area of this closed circuit is preserved , however the immage of the chord is no longer a straight segment and thus the symplectic area between @xmath197 and a new chord centered on @xmath184 will generally differ from the corresponding area evaluated at @xmath198 .",
    "this difference can be large , even for short times , if the tips of the initial chord are sufficiently far apart , i.e. when the argument of the initial wigner function is sufficiently far from the initial classical leaf .",
    "therefore , generally ( [ folk ] ) is simply wrong , semiclassically . in sharp contrast",
    ", the prescription based on the tips - of - the - chord flow ( [ corr ] ) provides a precise semiclassical evaluation of @xmath161 from @xmath162 .",
