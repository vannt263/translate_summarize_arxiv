    "in a previous paper @xcite we formulated a model which characterises the qcd vacuum by a `` lumpy '' distribution of field strength and topological charge density . for lack of a better name",
    "we shall refer to the model as `` the domain model '' .",
    "the formulation is given concretely in terms of a partition function which describes a statistical ensemble of domains , each of which is characterised by a set of internal parameters associated with the mean background gluon field , and the internal dynamics are represented by fluctuation fields .",
    "correlation functions in this model can be calculated by taking the mean field into account explicitly and decomposing over the fluctuations .",
    "we briefly review the details and assumptions behind the model in the next section but state here unambiguously that the `` domains '' in question are assumed to be purely quantum in nature .",
    "they are not semi - classical solutions of yang - mills theory and are not argued to exist as topologically stable classical configurations , rather they seek to characterise the average bulk properties of the ensemble of fields that determine the gluonic vacuum . in particular , it is not assumed that the topological charge associated with a domain should be an integer .",
    "the rationale of such an extremely simplified construction can be understood as an attempt to implicitly incorporate effects of the presence of singular pure gauge configurations in the qcd euclidean functional integral into a practical calculational scheme with a mean field description of the qcd ground state .",
    "a self - consistent mean field approach requires nonperturbative calculation of the free energy as a functional of the mean field whose minima should determine its form , but this is beyond the reach of analytical methods .",
    "nevertheless there is an accumulation of semi - qualitative arguments  @xcite in favour of the _ ansatz _ for the mean field we have chosen .    in the gluonic sector",
    "the model depends on two parameters , a mean field strength per domain @xmath0 and a mean size for domains @xmath1 , which is sufficient for an adequate description of the pure glue characteristics of the qcd vacuum  the gluon condensate , topological susceptibility , and string tension .",
    "the wilson loop in such a gluonic background was found to exhibit an area law dependence for large loops .",
    "thus a confinement of static fundamental charges is captured by the model ; some dynamical gluon degrees of freedom turn out also to be non - propagating .",
    "the absolute value of underlying average topological charge per domain was determined to be approximately @xmath2 and the density of domains to be as high as 42 @xmath3 . although tentative signals of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking were also obtained in @xcite , a more rigorous consideration of the fermionic spectrum and eigenmodes as well as calculation of the quark determinant is required , which was missed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we solve the eigenvalue problem for the dirac operator for the gluonic background and boundary conditions adopted in the model and examine the chirality properties of the eigenmodes .",
    "this is a necessary step for checking the status of chiral symmetry breaking in the domain model .",
    "but in view of recent lattice results this problem is valuable also in its own right .",
    "there are strong hints in lattice monte - carlo simulations at intermediate - range structures in individual gluon configurations once fluctuations are filtered out by some means .",
    "for example , cooling or relaxation algorithms are well established now @xcite , and can reveal instantonic like structures after several sweeps of a given lattice configuration .",
    "however , as these algorithms are designed precisely to locally minimise the action , it is natural they should bring objects with integer topological charge into relief . alternately , and more relevant to the present work , low - lying and zero - modes of the massless dirac operator can be used as a probe of long - range gluonic structures @xcite although only recently did this become more reliable with lattice fermions with good chirality properties .",
    "for example , exact index theorems are found to be satisfied on the lattice @xcite and the zero modes are seen to precisely correlate with instantonic structures in the raw lattice configuration , in the absence of cooling @xcite .",
    "however , the exact zero modes of any finite volume simulation can not be those relevant to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , rather the discrete spectrum of low - lying non - zero modes should , in the infinite volume limit , go over to a continuous band at zero , saturating the banks - casher relationship @xcite .",
    "such modes are sometimes called `` pseudo zero modes '' .",
    "low - lying non - zero modes with strong signs of chirality in regions of high action and topological charge densities would be a tool for identification of the properties of gluonic configurations relevant to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "indeed , after an initial negative result @xcite , recent results have emerged showing precisely this : low - lying non - zero modes of the overlap dirac operator which seem to accrue to topological structures and exhibit strong chirality , as measured by the local parameter @xmath4 defined by @xmath5 in regions where the probability density @xmath6 of these modes is maximal @xcite .",
    "the verification of the instantonic nature of these objects and their relevance to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the infinite volume is still being argued out in the literature ( see for example the recent large @xmath7 study of @xcite ) .",
    "an unbiased summary of the totality of available lattice results can be formulated as follows : that they support the importance of gluon configurations producing regions of approximately `` locked '' chromo - electric / magnetic fields for chiral symmetry breaking but do not yet confirm or rule out a specifically instantonic nature for these configurations  @xcite . a potential test which might clarify this",
    "would be a comparison of hadronic correlation functions between vacuum models and lattice simulations .",
    "such results are already available for instanton - based models @xcite .",
    "a search for complementary scenarios for the vacuum consistent with lattice results and incorporating confinement ( missed in the instanton models ) is evidently timely .",
    "this paper is a step in that direction for the domain - scenario .",
    "the core of this paper is the dirac eigenvalue / function problem for a spherical four - dimensional euclidean region of radius @xmath1 with bag - like boundary conditions on the fermions and in the presence of a covariantly constant ( anti- ) self - dual gauge field @xmath8 here @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the covariant derivative in the fundamental representation , @xmath11 where the ( anti-)self - dual tensor @xmath12 is constant , and the euclidean @xmath13matrices are in an anti - hermitean representation .",
    "the outcomes of this study are the peculiar chiral properties of eigenspinors @xmath14 : there are no zero modes and none of the modes is chiral but at the centre of a domain the local chirality parameter @xmath15 is found to be @xmath16 for all modes with zero orbital momentum .",
    "the sign of chirality and the duality of the tensor @xmath12 are locked : @xmath17 for an ( anti-)self - dual field",
    ". simultaneously the normal density for these modes is maximal at the centre . at the boundary the local chirality @xmath4 is equal to zero for all modes .",
    "the chirality of the lowest mode is a monotonic function inside the region while for the higher radial excitations the chirality alternates .",
    "the detailed form of @xmath15 changes with the variation of an arbitrary angle @xmath18 in the boundary condition .",
    "this angle is treated as a random variable .",
    "calculating chiralities averaged over a small central region for the various lowest modes , and operating in the whole ensemble of domains , we end up with a histogram which represents the probability of finding a given smeared chirality among the set of lowest modes .",
    "the histogram qualitatively reproduces the lattice results for the chirality of low - lying dirac modes such as those of @xcite and others .    after reviewing the domain model in the next section , we present details of the solution of the above - formulated problem and then study the chirality properties of the eigenmodes .",
    "we conclude with a discussion and future prospects .",
    "technical details of calculations and conventions for this paper are relegated to the appendices .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that the restrictive influence of pure gauge singularities ( present in instanton , monopole and vortex configurations ) on surrounding quantum fluctuations may be used for an approximate treatment of qcd dynamics . due to the complex structure of the manifold of gauge orbits in qcd",
    ", singular gauge fields may be unavoidable in the course of the elimination of redundant variables .",
    "obstructions such as the gribov problem and condensation of monopoles are two examples of this potentially more general statement .",
    "this has also long been advocated by van baal @xcite in his studies of the fundamental domain in small volume studies on the torus and sphere . in particular ,",
    "the proposal has been made that `` domain formation '' at larger volumes can be driven essentially by the non - trivial topology of the gauge field manifold . moreover ,",
    "it is stressed in @xcite that the full set of singular fields , instantons , monopoles and vortices must play a role in this .",
    "one can also add to this hierarchy domain wall singularities   @xcite which are not topologically stable on their own but can be part of a complicated object : a domain wall can start and end on a lower dimensional topologically nontrivial singularity of lower dimension , namely a vortex , and in this sense should not be neglected also .",
    "an arbitrary gauge field configuration @xmath19 containing a pure gauge singularity can be represented in the vicinity of the singularity as @xmath20 with @xmath21 a pure gauge singular field .",
    "if we now substitute this into the yang - mills lagrangian we will see that the requirement of finitness of the action density imposes specific conditions on the behaviour of @xmath22 in the vicinity of the singularity in @xmath23 .",
    "the model we consider focusses on domain wall singular hypersurfaces which are the most restrictive for @xmath22 ; an inclusion of lower dimensional singularities is a complicated task beyond the scope of the present work . in the case of domain wall",
    "the constraining influence of @xmath23 on gluon fluctuations @xmath22 and quark fields @xmath24 is expressed via the boundary conditions @xmath25 =   0 \\label{gluebc } , \\\\",
    "\\bar\\psi(x)\\!\\not\\!\\eta(x)\\psi(x)=0   \\label{genquarkbc } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath26 being on the singular hypersurface of the pure gauge field @xmath23 .",
    "these conditions ensure a non - vanishing weight for such fields in the functional integral .",
    "domain wall singular pure gauge configurations are topologically trivial .",
    "this implies that the field @xmath23 can be characterised by a definite colour direction @xmath27 and the matrix @xmath28 can always be tuned to belong to the cartan subalgebra of @xmath29 .",
    "the off - diagonal ( or , equivalently , orthogonal to @xmath27 ) components of the fluctuations @xmath22 must then satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions , while those fluctuations longitudinal to @xmath27 are not restricted at the domain wall .",
    "a typical configuration of this type looks like a system of domains which are coupled in a sense that fluctuations inside neighbouring domains interact with each other via exchange by the gluon modes longitudinal to the colour direction of the domain boundaries .",
    "it should be stressed that unavoidably there are obstructions of colour direction at the domain wall junctions where lower dimensional topologically nontrivial singularities are situated .    to be specific and to deal with an analytically tractable model we introduce several drastic simplifications : we disengage ourselves from the obstructions in the colour direction and substitute the coupling between domains by the presence of a mean field .",
    "inside and on the boundary of the domain the field is taken to be covariantly constant ( anti-)self - dual such that the strength over the whole euclidean space reads @xmath30 the individual colour and space orientations in each domain are random . in particular , effective action arguments were used in @xcite to constrain the form of @xmath31 such that the matrix @xmath32 with angles @xmath33 corresponding to the discrete weyl subgroup .",
    "domains are taken to be hyperspherical with a mean radius @xmath1 and centered at random points @xmath34 . for a detailed motivation of these steps",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .    in this way",
    ", consideration is reduced to a model with essentially two free parameters : the mean field strength @xmath0 and the mean domain radius @xmath1 . the partition function for this simplified system",
    "can be written down as @xmath35 \\delta_{\\rm fp}[\\breve{\\cal b}^{(i)},q^{(i ) } ] e^ { - s_{v_i}^{\\rm qcd } \\left[q^{(i)}+{\\cal b}^{(i ) } , \\psi^{(i)},\\bar\\psi^{(i ) } \\right ] } \\label{partf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functional spaces of integration @xmath36 and @xmath37 are specified by the boundary conditions @xmath38 @xmath39 here @xmath40 with the colour generators @xmath41 in the adjoint representation .",
    "the conditions eqs.([quarkbc ] ) and ( [ adjquarkbc ] ) represent specific ( though not unique ) choices for the implementation of eq.([genquarkbc ] ) which manifest the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry by the boundary condition , as occurs for example in bag models for the nucleon .",
    "the thermodynamic limit assumes @xmath42 but with the density @xmath43 taken fixed and finite .",
    "the partition function is formulated in a background field gauge with respect to the domain mean field .",
    "the measure of integration over parameters characterising domains is @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the spherical angles of the chromomagnetic field , @xmath46 is the angle between chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields and @xmath47 is an angle parametrising the colour orientation . it should be noted that because of the axial anomaly and that nothing _ a priori _ constrains the topological charge per domain to be integral the fermion determinant is a single valued function of @xmath48 only if an appropriate riemman surface is constructed .",
    "here @xmath49 enumerates the riemman sheets to be taken into account .",
    "this partition function describes a statistical system of density @xmath50 composed of extended domain - like structures , each of which is characterised by a set of internal parameters and whose internal dynamics are represented by the fluctuation fields .",
    "it respects all the symmetries of the qcd lagrangian , since the statistical ensemble is invariant under space - time and colour gauge symmetries .",
    "for the same reason , if the quarks are massless then the chiral invariance is respected .",
    "field eigenmodes satisfying the above boundary conditions in the presence of an ( anti-)self - dual gluon field and corresponding green functions can be calculated explicitly . for gluons ,",
    "this was shown in @xcite .",
    "for quarks , this will be shown in this paper . on this basis",
    "one can compute any correlation function taking the mean field into account exactly and decomposing the integrand over fluctuations .",
    "in particular , correlation functions of the mean field itself have a finite radius @xmath1 , which is more or less obvious and is discussed in  @xcite in detail .    within this framework",
    "the gluon condensate to lowest order in fluctuations is immediately obtained in the form @xmath51 and the topological susceptibility reads @xmath52 less trivial is the manifestation of an area law for static quarks .",
    "computation of the wilson loop for a circular contour of a large radius @xmath53 gives a string tension @xmath54 with the function @xmath55 estimations of the values of these quantities are known from lattice calculation or phenomenological approaches and can be used to fit @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "as described in @xcite these parameters are fixed to be @xmath56 with the average absolute value of topological charge per domain turning out to be @xmath57 and the density of domains @xmath58 .",
    "the topological susceptibility then turns out to be @xmath59 , comparable to the witten - veneziano value @xcite .",
    "we have mentioned already that the boundary conditions on fermions violate chiral symmetry explicitly which can only be restored by a random assignment of values of @xmath18 over the complete ensemble of domains in euclidean space .    in this section",
    "we address the eigenvalue problem for the massless dirac operator as it is stated in eqs .",
    "( [ evp-0 ] ) . here",
    "we give the scheme for solving the problem , with technical details given in the appendices .",
    "the dirac matrices in euclidean space are chosen to be anti - hermitean and taken in the chiral representation .    for boundary conditions on a hypersphere and covariantly constant background field of definite duality",
    "it is natural to use hyperspherical coordinates @xmath60 , given in detail in appendix a. in such coordinates , rather than work with the covariant derivative itself , it is more convenient to introduce the operator @xmath61 which can be easily expanded into intrinsic and orbital angular momentum generators .",
    "any spinor can be represented in the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 have the same chirality .",
    "this is simply a decomposition into a sum of chiral components .",
    "the eigenvalue equation eq .",
    "( [ evp-0 ] ) can be rewritten then identically as @xmath65 in these terms the boundary conditions take the form @xmath66 where upper ( lower ) signs correspond to @xmath63 and @xmath64 with chirality @xmath67 .    a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ main ] ) is achieved by separating the angular and radial coordinates . to do",
    "this one has to represent respectively @xmath68 and @xmath69 in terms of momentum generators and projectors onto the various spin and colour polarization subspaces . in four - dimensional euclidean space",
    "the angular momentum operators can be represented as @xmath70 with @xmath71 the usual three - dimensional angular momentum operator and @xmath72 the euclidean version of the boost operator .",
    "these correspond to the decomposition of the four dimensional rotational group @xmath73 into a product of two @xmath74 groups .",
    "they lead to casimirs and eigenvalues @xmath75 and the correponding angular eigenfunctions @xmath76 , given explicitly in appendix a , are labelled by orbital momentum @xmath77 and two azimuthal numbers @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "eigenstates are also characterized by the colour - spin polarisation related to the projectors @xmath80 with @xmath81 being respectively the separate projectors for colour and spin polarizations .",
    "below we denote the polarisation with respect to @xmath82 by @xmath83 .",
    "it is shown in appendix b that if the background field is ( anti-)self - dual the boundary condition can only be implemented if spinors @xmath84 and @xmath64 are ( right ) left handed .",
    "also the presence of the homogeneous background field reduces the spherical symmetry of the problem down to an axial - symmetry . in the representation",

    "the statement that signals for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking should be identifiable in the specific chirality properties of fermionic eigenmodes for some `` dominant '' gluonic background field is generally accepted .",
    "such signals are now being seen on the lattice , but nevertheless there are not so many analytically explicit examples of this relationship available .",
    "instanton motivated models are certainly the most advanced example of this kind .",
    "but one aspect of instanton models lies in the ` dual ' use to which the exact fermion zero modes of the classical instanton background are subject : these modes have definite chirality and do not contribute in the infinite volume limit , but are used to model pseudo zero modes which should characterise the non - semi - classical system of strongly overlapping instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "we have studied the spectrum of quark modes in a domainlike structured gluon background field .",
    "such a background is argued to characterise the bulk average properties of the vacuum in the presence of strong intermediate range fluctuations and is not the result of a semi - classical approximation .",
    "the spectrum exhibits definite chirality properties .",
    "in particular , there are no zero modes because of the conditions which fermion fields must satisfy on the boundaries of domains . nonetheless at the centre of domains all radial modes are purely chiral and the sign of their chirality depends on whether the underlying gluon field is self - dual or anti - self - dual .",
    "moreover , the sign of chirality at the centre persists over the whole domain for the lowest modes . studying the local chirality parameter @xmath4 in a chirally symmetric ensemble of domains we obtain qualitatively similar results to those seen in lattice calculations .",
    "we stress that this comparison with lattice results takes place at the level of an ensemble of configurations not on a configuration by configuration basis .",
    "insofar as these lattice results for chirality are argued as supporting the evidence for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , the same can be said of the domain model .",
    "we note the absence of any explicit zero modes in achieving this .",
    "namely , the range of configurations needed to produce the types of effects seen on the lattice are not restricted to instanton - like fields .",
    "it suffices that a given gluon background admit strongly chiral low - lying non - zero modes . in this respect ,",
    "the more significant property of the gluon background is the `` locking '' of chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields into self - dual or anti - self - dual fields in relatively large but finite regions of space restricted by the hypersurfaces on which a pure gauge singularities are assumed to be situated .",
