    "oblique projectors are of assistance to signal processing applications @xcite , in particular due to their ability to discriminate signal components lying in different subspaces . thereby ,",
    "as discussed in @xcite , oblique projectors are suitable for filtering structured noise .",
    "let us suppose for instance that a given signal @xmath0 , represented mathematically as an element of a vector space @xmath1 , is produced by the superposition of two phenomena , i.e. @xmath2 where @xmath3 belongs to a subspace @xmath4 and @xmath5 belongs to subspace @xmath6 .",
    "provided that @xmath7 we can obtain from @xmath0 the component @xmath3 by an oblique projection onto @xmath8 along @xmath9 , which maps @xmath5 to zero without altering @xmath3 .",
    "the procedure is straightforward and effective if the corresponding subspaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 , such that @xmath10 , are known @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this may not be always the case . in this letter",
    "we address the problem of selecting the appropriate subspace @xmath8 , from the spanning set of a larger subspace , in order to fulfil the condition @xmath11 assuming that @xmath9 is known and fixed .    given a signal , our strategy for the selection of the representation subspace is in the line of matching pursuit ( mp ) methodologies @xcite and is made out of two ingredients i ) the sampling / reconstruction _ consistency requirement _ introduced in @xcite and extended in @xcite ii ) a recursive procedure for adapting the dual vectors giving rise to the corresponding oblique projector @xcite . it will be shown here that the latter yields an effective implementation of a selection criterion that we base on the consistency principle .    the letter is organized as follows : sec  [ sec_2 ] introduces the general framework and discusses the ingredients of the approach .",
    "namely , the consistency principle and the recursive updating of the measurement vectors for achieving the required oblique projection .",
    "the oblique matching pursuit strategy is introduced in sec  [ sec_3 ] .",
    "its implementation is discussed in sec  [ sec_4 ] along with a numerical example .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in sec  [ sec_5 ] .",
    "we represent a signal @xmath0 as an element of an inner product space that is assumed to be finite dimensional .",
    "the square norm is computed as @xmath12 , where the brackets denote the corresponding inner product and we define the inner product in such a way that if @xmath13 is a complex number @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the complex conjugate of @xmath13 .",
    "measurements of a signal @xmath0 ( also called samples ) will be represented as linear functionals .",
    "thus a set of , say @xmath16 , sampling vectors @xmath17 provides us with a set of @xmath16 measurements on @xmath0 given by the inner products @xmath18 .",
    "the superscript @xmath16 is used to indicate that to reconstruct the signal we will need to modify the measurement vectors @xmath19 if an additional measure is considered . from the sampling measurements we can construct an approximation @xmath20 of @xmath0 using a set of reconstruction vectors @xmath21 . the _ consistency principle _ introduced in @xcite states that the reconstruction @xmath20 from @xmath22 should be self - consistent in the sense that if the approximation is sampled with the same vectors the same samples should be obtained . in other words ,",
    "a consistent reconstruction must satisfy : @xmath23 this requirement has been considered further in @xcite where it is proved that : _ if the reconstruction vectors @xmath21 span a subspace @xmath24 and the sampling vectors @xmath25 span a subspace @xmath26 such that its orthogonal complement @xmath27 satisfies @xmath28 , then @xmath20 is a consistent reconstruction of @xmath0 if and only if @xmath20 is the oblique projection of @xmath0 onto @xmath24 along @xmath27 .",
    "_ we represent the corresponding oblique projector as @xmath29 .",
    "hence , it is endowed with the following properties i ) @xmath30 , ii ) @xmath31 iii ) @xmath32 given the conditions of the above statement , the unique consistent approximation of @xmath0 is therefore @xmath33 .",
    "the oblique projector can be expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 indicates that @xmath29 acts by performing inner products as in @xmath36 explicit equations for updating an oblique projector when a new pair of reconstruction / measurement vectors is to be considered are given in @xcite .",
    "as will be discussed in the next sections , for the purpose of this contribution we can restrict the measurement vectors to be lineally independent . hence the vectors @xmath37 yielding oblique projectors along @xmath27 onto nested subspaces @xmath38 can be inductively obtained as follows :    construct vectors @xmath39 , with @xmath40 the orthogonal projector onto @xmath27 . from @xmath41 every time a new vector is needed compute it , and update the previous ones , through the equations @xcite : [ eq ] w_i^k+1&=&w_i^k- w_k+1^k+1 u_k+1 , w_i^k , i=1,  ,k [ wik ] + w_k+1^k+1&= & , q_k+1= u_k+1-_u_k+1 , [ wkkp ] where @xmath42 is the orthogonal projector onto @xmath43 .",
    "it should be noticed that @xmath44 , with @xmath45 indicating the orthogonal sum and @xmath46 the direct sum .    in the next section",
    "we introduce a method for stepwise selection of the measurement vectors aiming at finding a subspace @xmath24 for reconstruction such that @xmath47 .",
    "matching pursuit strategies for signal representation evolve by stepwise selection of vectors , called atoms , which are drawn from a large set called a dictionary . unless the dictionary is orthonormal , the seminal approach @xcite does not yield a stepwise reconstruction of the orthogonal projection of the signal onto a selected subspace .",
    "a variation of this approach , called orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) does yield the orthogonal projection @xcite .",
    "such a reconstruction is therefore optimal in the sense of minimizing the norm of the approximation error .",
    "however , to render a matching pursuit strategy suitable for discriminating signals representing different phenomena , the approach needs to be generalized . in order to propose the oblique matching pursuit ( oblmp ) method addressing this problem",
    "we make the following assumptions .    *",
    "the subspace @xmath27 in which the signal component to be filtered lies is known . *",
    "the signal we wish to filter admits a unique decomposition @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming @xmath51 with @xmath47 . *",
    "the subspace @xmath24 can be spanned by vectors of the dictionary in hand .    as discussed in the previous section , the reconstruction that eliminates",
    "the signal component in @xmath27 is @xmath33 .",
    "our goal is to construct the oblique projector by using the appropriate dictionary vectors . we know how to update @xmath29 to @xmath52 so as to account for the inclusion of an additional vector @xmath53 .",
    "the question arises now as to how to select @xmath53 giving rise to the right subspace .",
    "we answer this question by recourse to the consistency principle @xcite . considering that at iteration @xmath16",
    "the approximation @xmath20 of @xmath0 is @xmath54 , let us define the consistency error with regard to a new measurement @xmath55 as @xmath56 .",
    "thus to construct the approximation @xmath57 we propose to select the measurement vector @xmath55 such that [ cri1 ] w^k+1_k+1 = _ |w^k+1 _ , f - f| , where @xmath58 is the set of indices labeling the corresponding dictionary vectors not selected in the previous steps .",
    "[ p1 ] if vectors @xmath59 have been selected by criterion and @xmath60 , the measurement vector @xmath55 and the previously selected vectors @xmath59 are linearly independent .",
    "assume that , on the contrary , @xmath60 and there exists a set of numbers @xmath61 such that @xmath62 .",
    "since for the previously selected vectors the consistency condition holds , i.e. @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 this contradicts our assumption , which implies that @xmath65 .",
    "[ p2 ] all measurement vectors @xmath66 ( c.f .",
    "are orthogonal to the reconstruction vectors selected in previous iterations .",
    "every @xmath66 is computed as in and for @xmath67 it is true that @xmath68 .",
    "the last proposition allows us to re - state the oblmp selection criterion as [ cri2 ] w^k+1_k+1 = _ |w^k+1 _ , f | .",
    "proposition [ p1 ] ensures that , for a given tolerance @xmath69 , by stopping the selection process when the condition @xmath70 is reached , the method only selects linearly independent measurement vectors .",
    "let us assume that at iteration @xmath71 the selected indices are @xmath72 and denote @xmath73 and @xmath74 to the corresponding duals .",
    "since @xmath75 the fact that @xmath76 are linearly independent implies that @xmath77 are linearly independent .",
    "hence , as will be shown by the next proposition , at step @xmath71 the proposed selection criterion yields a subspace @xmath78 satisfying the requested property that @xmath79 .",
    "[ p3 ] if nonzero vectors @xmath73 are linearly independent the only vector in @xmath80 which is also in @xmath81 is the zero vector .",
    "suppose that there exists @xmath82 such that @xmath83 .",
    "hence , @xmath84 and there exists a set of numbers @xmath85 to express @xmath86 as a linear combination @xmath87 .",
    "thus @xmath88 , which using the definition of @xmath89 implies that @xmath90 . for",
    "nonzero linearly independent vectors this implies @xmath91 and therefore @xmath92 .    at iteration",
    "@xmath71 the selected indices @xmath72 are the labels of the atoms @xmath93 yielding the signal reconstruction as given by [ rec ] f^k+1= f = _",
    "i=1^k+1 w^k+1_i , f v__i = _",
    "i=1^k+1 c^k+1_i v__i .",
    "the coefficients in the last equation can be updated at each iteration according to and , i.e. , c^k+1_k+1 & = & w^k+1_k+1 , f [ ckkp ] + c^k_+1_i & = & c_i^k - c^k+1_k+1 w^k_i , u__k+1 , i=1,  ,k .",
    "[ cik ] it is appropriate to point out that these equations , as well as and , have the identical form of the equations to modify the dual vectors and the coefficients in the optimized orthogonal matching pursuit approach ( oomp ) @xcite .",
    "however , now the equations involve vectors of different nature yielding therefore a different approach .",
    "oomp updating arises as the particular case , corresponding to @xmath94 , for which @xmath95 .",
    "nevertheless , since the criterion for the selection process we have adopted here does not necessarily minimize the norm of the residual error , oomp is not a truly particular case of the new approach . on the contrary",
    ", we are introducing an alternative selection criterion based on the consistency principle , which could also be considered for producing yet one more variation of omp .",
    "in consistence with the hypothesis itemized in sec .  [ sec_3 ] we consider that the subspace @xmath27 is given , i.e. @xmath96 such that @xmath97 is known . for constructing @xmath40",
    "there are a number of possibilities . in the example we present here",
    "the set @xmath96 is linearly dependent and we have used the technique for dictionary redundancy elimination proposed in @xcite .",
    "matlab code for its implementation is available at @xcite .",
    "the method produces a set of orthonormal vectors @xmath98 , @xmath99 that we use to construct @xmath100 .",
    "given a dictionary @xmath101 we proceed to compute vectors @xmath102 as @xmath103 .",
    "except for the selection criterion the next steps parallel those for the implementation of oomp but considering the dictionary @xmath102 .",
    "a routine for implementation of oomp based on modified gram smidth orthogonalization with re - orthogonalization is also available at @xcite . with very minor changes that routine",
    "can be used for the implementation of oblmp .",
    "the algorithm is described below .",
    "starting by assigning @xmath104 at the first step we select the index @xmath105 corresponding to the index for which @xmath106 is maximal and set @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the index set @xmath58 is changed to @xmath109 . at step @xmath71 the sequence @xmath110 ( at this stage @xmath58 is the subset of indices not selected in the previous @xmath16 steps ) is orthogonalized with respect to @xmath111 as : @xmath112 and , if necessary , reorthogonalized with respect to @xmath113 i.e. , @xmath114 after selecting the index @xmath115 as the maximizer of @xmath106 we set @xmath116 and @xmath117 and compute @xmath118 according to and @xmath119 according to . for a given tolerance parameter @xmath120",
    "the algorithm is to be stopped when @xmath121 for all @xmath122 .",
    "the reconstructed signal is then obtained as in .",
    "we illustrate now the proposed method and its motivation by the following example : we assume the signal space to be the cardinal cubic spline space with distance @xmath123 between consecutive knots , on the interval @xmath124 $ ] .",
    "the background we wish to filter belongs to the subspace spanned by the set of functions @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "this set is highly redundant .",
    "a good representation of the span can be achieved by just five linearly independent functions . actually , to avoid possible bad conditioning",
    ", we used only three orthonormal functions for constructing @xmath40 and verified a posteriori that this was enough for the backgrounds we were dealing with .",
    "in the first test the dictionary is the b - spline basis on @xmath124 $ ] .",
    "we considered 100 signals , each of which was randomly generated as linear combination of 20 dictionary functions .",
    "one of such signals is plotted in the top graph of figure  1 added to the background .",
    "the functions which are obtained by subtracting to each basis function its orthogonal projection onto @xmath27 are not exactly linearly dependent .",
    "however , the problem of constructing the duals is badly conditioned .",
    "hence , the oblique projection onto the whole space does not yield the desired signal splitting . a failed attempt to separate the signal components is displayed by the broken line in the bottom graph of figure  1 . on the contrary , by applying the oblmp approach",
    ", we could pick from the whole basis some elements spanning a subspace which includes the subspace in which the signal lies .",
    "thus , as depicted in the same figure , the signal discrimination is successful .",
    "equivalent results were obtained for all the others signals . in the second test",
    "the dictionary spanning the identical space consists of highly coherent spline atoms of twice as much support as the corresponding basis functions @xcite . in this case out of 100 signals , randomly generated as linear combination of 20 dictionary functions , the oblmp approach successfully split 90 of them .",
    "the failures are due to the fact that , since the selection process is carried out by choosing a single atom at each step , in some cases it finds the right subspace by selecting a larger one which eventually includes the signal subspace .",
    "the construction of the duals in a larger subspace is likely to become faster badly conditioned when , as in the second test , the selected elements @xmath126 are more coherent . on the other hand , related theoretical work @xcite supports the assertion that a step - wise selection approach should be expected to make incorrect decisions more frequently when the coherence of the dictionary is larger .    .",
    "the broken line of the bottom graph depicts the result of applying the oblique projection onto the subspace spanned by the whole b - spline basis on @xmath124 $ ] .",
