    "although the first observation of superfluid behavior in helium-4 dates back to 1937 @xcite , it was not until 1995 that superfluid associated with bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite was discovered in dilute atomic gases @xcite . while the atom - atom interactions are too complicated to handle in liquid state helium-4 , a dilute atomic gas opens the possibility to construct a microscopic theory for superfluidity .",
    "since 1995 , atomic quantum gases have served as excellent fertile ground for studying quantum coherence properties of matter and for testing interesting many body theories .",
    "the theoretical and experimental studies of atomic condensates have also focused on their quantum coherence properties . shortly after the initial discovery of bec",
    ", it was understood that a finite sized condensate , in addition to the usual decoherence due to imperfect isolation from the environment , suffers from quantum phase diffusion @xcite , an interaction driven decoherence due to atomic number fluctuations from within the condensate @xcite .",
    "this study suggests a third source of decoherence , which we show limits the lifetime of a quasi - particle excitation from a condensate , based on the mechanism of thin spectrum as recently proposed and applied to any quantum system with a spontaneously broken symmetry @xcite .",
    "our work therefore constitutes a natural application of the thin spectrum formalism to the highly successful mean field theory for atomic condensates , where the condensate is treated as a u(1 ) gauge symmetry breaking field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we begin with a review of a toy model calculation for the lifetime of the coherent condensate ground state as well as a squeezed ground state and a thermal coherent state .",
    "we then review the concept of _ thin spectrum _ and show how it is connected with spontaneous symmetry breaking and decoherence of an atomic condensate . in sec .",
    "iv , we show how the quasi - particle excitations of an atomic bose - einstein condensate are affected by the thin spectrum associated with the ground state condensate . finally , in sec .",

    "the ground state of an @xmath0 boson system is with all @xmath0 bosons in the lowest energy eigenstate , the zero momentum state for a homogeneous gas .",
    "however , it can not simply be a fock state since bose - einstein condensation entails a definite phase from the broken phase u(1 ) symmetry , while a number state has no definite phase .",
    "a reasonable approximation is to consider a coherent state occupation for the zero - mode with an amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "taking @xmath2 real is equivalent to explicitly picking a phase of the u(1 ) symmetry . because such a coherent state is not an energy eigenstate",

    ", we discuss the dynamics of the associated phase collapse based on a simple toy model to calculate the rate of this collapse and study the modifications arising from a squeezed ground state .",

    "the arguments of @xmath48 and @xmath2 determine which quadrature is squeezed . in particular , if both @xmath48 and @xmath2 are real , then the state is a number squeezed state , with the uncertainty in atom number reduced at the cost of higher uncertainty in the conjugate phase variable .",
    "we expect such a state to have a longer life time , since the phase collapse speed is generally proportional to @xmath49 , which is smaller in this case , as have recently observed experimentally @xcite . a wide phase distribution , on the other hand , makes the squeezed state more similar to a fock state which has a uniform phase distribution , and is less influenced by the decoherence effect due to the u(1 ) symmetry breaking field because of the reduced number fluctuations .    in order to understand the essence of the above discussion , we choose to follow similar arguments as with the coherent state considered previously .",
