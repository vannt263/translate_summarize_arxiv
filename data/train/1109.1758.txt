    "poisson algebra appears naturally in hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "it plays a central role in the study of poisson geometry : a poisson manifold is a smooth manifold whose associative algebra of smooth functions is equipped with the structure of a poisson algebra . to meet the development of the deformation of poisson manifolds , it is helpful to introduce certain deformation theory for poisson algebras . for this one needs a more general concept of poisson structures .",
    "note that there are many generalizations of poisson structures developed by different authors from different perspectives , see for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the notion of poisson algebra as introduced in @xcite . by definition , a ( non - commutative ) _ poisson algebra _ over a field @xmath3",
    "consists of a triple @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an associative @xmath3-algebra and @xmath6 is a lie algebra over @xmath3 , such that the leibniz rule @xmath7 holds for all @xmath8 . unlike the classical ones , the associative multiplication is not necessarily commutative",
    "this is the most simple way of generalization in algebraic nature , and has been studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "we mention that this notion is different from the non - commutative poisson algebra developed by xu @xcite . as a natural generalization of commutative poisson algebra ,",
    "such a structure carries rich information . even in the study of commutative poisson algebras",
    ", it will be quite useful .",
    "for example , an interesting observation shows that the deformation quantization theory by kontsevich can be understood as a special kind of deformation within this version of poisson algebras , see @xcite for more detail . in this paper and its sequel",
    ", we will make an attempt to investigate deeply the cohomology theories for poisson algebras .",
    "a standard way to construct cohomology theory for an algebraic structure is to consider its module category .",
    "poisson module over a poisson algebra was defined in @xcite in a natural way , see also @xcite . later on in @xcite , the authors studied another version of module , say quasi - poisson module , over a poisson algebra .",
    "moreover , they introduced the ( quasi-)poisson enveloping algebra for a poisson algebra , and showed that the category of ( quasi-)poisson modules is equivalent to the category of modules over the ( quasi-)poisson enveloping algebra , see also section 2 below for detail .",
    "we emphasize that for commutative poisson algebras , a different version of poisson enveloping algebra has been introduced in @xcite , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2.6 ) for an explanation .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the category of ( quasi-)poisson modules has enough projective and injective objects , which enables the construction of the cohomology theory for a poisson algebra by using projective or injective resolutions .",
    "we aim to develop a cohomology theory , the quasi - poisson cohomology , for poisson algebras in this paper .",
    "the ideal is quite easy . for a poisson algebra @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath0 itself is a quasi - poisson module , and naively we may study its yoneda extension group in the category of quasi - poisson modules , which we call the quasi - poisson cohomology group of @xmath0 .    as we will show below",
    ", the quasi - poisson cohomology relates to the hochschild cohomology and lie algebra cohomology closely .",
    "in fact , there exists a grothendieck spectral sequence , connecting the quasi - poisson cohomology with the hodchschild cohomology and the lie algebra cohomology . in some extreme cases",
    ", the quasi - poisson cohomology algebra is shown to be the tensor product of the hochschild cohomology and the lie algebra cohomology .",
    "the quasi - poisson cohomology plays an important role in the calculation of so - called flato - gerstenhaber - voronov poisson cohomology as introduced in @xcite , a cohomology which controls the formal deformation of a poisson algebra , see @xcite for details .",
    "another application is to the study of an associative algebra , say the quasi - poisson cohomology group of the standard poisson algebra will give us an interesting invariant , carrying the information of both the hochschild cohomologies and the lie algebra cohomologies .    throughout @xmath3",
    "will be a field of characteristic zero .",
    "all algebras considered are over @xmath3 and we write @xmath9 and @xmath10 for brevity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 recalls basic definitions and notions . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the concept of quasi - poisson cohomology groups for a poisson algebra @xmath0 , and in order to calculate it we construct a free resolution of @xmath0 as a quasi - poisson module , see theorem [ proj.resol ] .",
    "moreover , we introduce the quasi - poisson complex for a poisson algebra , which will simplify the calculation . as an application , some special quasi - poisson cohomology groups are obtained in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we construct a grothendieck spectral sequence for a smash product algebra , which connects the quasi - poisson cohomology with the hochschild cohomology and the lie algebra cohomology when applying to a poisson algebra .",
    "in this paper , we assume that all associative algebras will have a multiplicative identity element .",
