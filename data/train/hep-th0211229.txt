    "our understanding of the correspondence between gauge fields and strings improved recently due to the development of the idea of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . the most remarkable achievement was the comparison of the superstring and field theory computations of the quantities which are not protected by the symmetries .",
    "an important example is the study of the wilson loop functional @xcite . for the loop of the circular shape",
    "it was computed to all orders in the perturbation theory in the large @xmath3 yang - mills @xcite .",
    "the result analytically continued to the strong coupling limit was found to be in agreement with the string theory computation . in another",
    "very recent development , the anomalous dimension of the twist two operators in the @xmath0 yang - mills theory was computed from the properties of the extremal surfaces @xcite .",
    "already these two examples show the importance of the study of the extremal surfaces in ads space for understanding the relation between gauge fields and strings .    in our paper we will study a class of the wilson loops which corresponds to a special class of the extremal surfaces in ads  special legendrian submanifolds .",
    "this is a large class of extremal surfaces which are easier to study than the generic extemal surface .",
    "the reason for simplifications is that the special legendrian submanifolds satisfy the first order differential equations while the generic minimal surfaces satisfy the second order differential equations .",
    "we were not able to find explicitly the generic special legendrian surface in ads space and we think that it is actually not possible . but",
    "nontrivial explicit examples of the special legendrian manifolds are known for @xmath4 @xcite and presumably can be constructed by similar methods in @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we will consider only a simplest nontrivial example and will mostly concentrate on general aspects of the special legendrian manifolds in @xmath1",
    ".    we will give the definition of the special legendrian manifold in section 2 .",
    "the surface ending on the circular contour on the boundary which was found in @xcite is a special case of a special legendrian manifold .",
    "we will give another example in section 2 .",
    "in section 3 we will find the necessary conditions for the contour in @xmath5 to be the boundary of the special legendrian manifold in @xmath1 and find all solutions to these conditions in terms of a real function of one real variable .",
    "we conjecture that at least for the contours which are close to the circular contour these conditions are in fact necessary and sufficient .",
    "we call such contours the `` special contact wilson loops '' . in section 4 we will consider the infinitesimal deformations of the special legendrian manifold ending on the circular wilson loop",
    ". we will confirm by the explicit calculation that the infinitesimal deformations preserve the differential conditions on the special contact wilson loop . in section 5",
    "we will show that the special contact wilson loop does not in general preserve any supersymmetry . in section 6 we will study the behavior of a special legendrian manifold near the boundary of the ads space . in section 7",
    "we study the regularized area of the special legendrian manifold .",
    "we did not succeed in calculating the regularized area for the general special contact boundary .",
    "this would presumably require the knowledge of the actual special legendrian surface .",
    "but we do know something about the infinitesimal variation of the regularized area under the variation of the contour ( not necessarily preserving the special contact condition ) .",
    "there is a special vector field @xmath6 in @xmath5 which enters into the definition of the special legendrian manifold .",
    "we show that the variation of the regularized area functional under the infinitesimal deformation of the special contact contour is zero provided that the normal vector describing the variation is orthogonal to @xmath6 pointwise on the contour .",

    "it would be interesting to see whether this is true only at strong coupling .",
    "an interesting feature of the special legendrian surfaces is that the worldsheet coordinates satisfy the first order differential equations .",
    "this is usually associated with the supersymmetry .",
    "however the string wrapped on the special legendrian manifold does not in fact preserve any supersymmetry .",
    "a special case of the special contact wilson loop is the circular wilson loop . on the field theory side the circular wilson loop classically preserves half of the supersymmetry .",
    "but quantum mechanically all the supersymmetry is presumably broken because of the problems with the regularization @xcite .",
    "on the string theory side the corresponding string worldsheet is not supersymmetric even on the classical level . and for the special contact wilson loops which are not circular we show in section 6 that the supersymmetry is completely broken already in the field theory even classically .",
    "we consider @xmath1 embedded into @xmath9 as the hyperboloid @xmath10 the boundary of @xmath1 is the projectivization of the lightcone @xmath8 : @xmath11 the lightcone separates the future @xmath12 from the past @xmath13 .",
