    "two - dimensional frustrated heisenberg spin systems with noncollinear or canted order have attracted much attention recently .",
    "noncollinear order arises due to frustration , which may originate from different sources .",
    "the most common kind of frustration is realized in antiferromagnets on a two - dimensional ( or three - dimensional stacked ) triangular lattice .",
    "prototypes of these geometrically frustrated magnets are pyrochlores.@xcite a second source of frustration may be a competition between nearest - neighbor and further - neighbor exchange interactions between spins .",
    "typical examples are helimagnets , where a magnetic spiral is formed along a certain direction of the lattice.@xcite a third kind of frustration may occur by chemical doping of a magnetically ordered system . in this case , the spin - current of the itinerant doped charges couples to the local magnetic moment of the magnetic host , leading to the formation of a noncollinear magnetic state .",
    "this situation may be realized in lightly doped cuprate superconductors .",
    "@xcite    the main characteristic of the noncollinear state is that the spin configuration must be described by a set of three orthonormal vectors or , alternatively , by a rotational matrix which defines the orientation of this set with respect to some fixed reference frame . as a consequence ,",
    "the order - parameter space is isomorphic to the three - dimensional rotational group @xmath0 , and in the low - temperature phase , when the rotational symmetry is fully broken , three spin - wave modes are present in the system , instead of two , as in the nonfrustrated case . moreover",
    ", topological defects may arise in the system , associated with the chiral degeneracy of the spiral , which can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise . because the order parameter space has a nontrivial first homotopy group , @xmath1=\\mathbb{z}_2 $ ] , the topological excitations are vortex - like . on the other hand , skyrmions are not present because the second homotopy group of the @xmath0 is trivial , @xmath2=0 $ ] .",
    "@xcite    a convenient field - theoretical description of frustrated heisenberg systems in the long - wavelength limit is provided by the @xmath0 nonlinear sigma ( nl@xmath3 ) model .",
    "@xcite its critical behavior in two dimensions has been extensively investigated , both in the absence and in the presence of topological excitations .",
    "studies in the former case have revealed a dynamical enhancement of the symmetry from @xmath4 to @xmath5 under renormalization group flow in @xmath6 , which means that in the critical region all the three spin - wave modes have the same velocity.@xcite when topological excitations are included , a complex finite - temperature behavior is found.@xcite numerical studies , as well as analysis involving entropy and free energy arguments , indicate the occurrence of a transition driven by vortex - antivortex pairs unbinding at a finite temperature @xmath7.@xcite in contrast to the @xmath8 case , here vortices and spin - waves are coupled already in the harmonic approximation , and anharmonic spin - wave interactions yield a finite correlation length for arbitrarily low temperatures .",
    "@xcite therefore , the transition mediated by vortices is rather a crossover than a true kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition.@xcite free vortices start to proliferate at the temperature @xmath7 , similarly as vortices in the @xmath8 model do above the kt - transition temperature .    in the present paper",
    "we study the physical properties of frustrated heisenberg spin system , which are sensitive to the dynamics of the above - mentioned topological defects .",
    "the approach we use has been employed to describe the dynamics of excitations in a very broad class of one- or two - dimensional systems.@xcite the central idea is the application of the collective - coordinate method @xcite to quantize a non - trivial static solution of the classical equation of motion of the field - theoretical model in question . in our case , we find that single vortex - like excitations or vortex - antivortex pairs are the localized static solution of the @xmath0 nl@xmath3 model .",
    "a proper description of the quantum levels associated with these solutions is provided , on the semi - classical level , by a theory in which the topological excitation is represented by a single quantum mechanical variable coupled to a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators , which are the fluctuations about the classical solution itself .",
    "thus , the resulting effective model represents a particle ( the topological defect ) scattered by the linearized excitations of the system .",
    "the latter can be integrated out using the standard system - plus - reservoir approach , @xcite leading to a dissipative equation of motion for the topological excitation . as a consequence , any physical property of these systems that depends on the motion of the topological excitations",
    "may be expressed in terms of transport coefficients - such as mobility and diffusion - of these damped defects .",
    "since we do neglect any interaction between the defects , our results are only valid for a diluted gas of topological excitations .",
    "part of our results concerning the mobility of a vortex - antivortex defect has been recently published in ref .  . here , besides a complete presentation of the technical details , we discuss also the transport at finite frequencies and we compare -qualitatively and quantitatively- the cases where the defect is represented by a single vortex or by a vortex - antivortex pair . moreover , in the light of new experimental results by ando _ et al . _ , @xcite we discuss the relevance of the single vortices for the transport in the spin - glass phase of cuprates .",

    "ii the quantum hamiltonian describing the dynamics of the topological defect coupled to a bath of magnetic excitations . in sec .",
    "iii the equation governing the evolution of the reduced density matrix for the topological defect is obtained and the influence functional , which describes the effect of the magnon bath on the dynamics of the vortices is evaluated .",

    "vi we discuss how a spiral state may be realized in cuprates and we then apply our results to this specific case .",
