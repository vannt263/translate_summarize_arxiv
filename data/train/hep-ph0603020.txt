    "observation of nonzero neutrino masses and determination of two of their three mixing parameters by experiments have raised the hope that neutrinos may provide a clue to flavor structure among quarks@xcite . in order to make progress in this direction however , one needs knowledge of the detailed nature of the quark - lepton connection e.g. whether there is an energy scale where quarks and leptons are unified into one matter ( or grand unification of matter ) .",
    "while there are similarities between quarks and leptons that make such an unification plausible , there are also many differences between them which may apriori point the other way : for instance , the mixing pattern among quarks is very different from that among leptons and the neutrino mass matrices in the flavor basis exhibit symmetries for which there apparently is no trace among quarks .",
    "two examples of such apparent lepton - exclusive symmetries are : ( a ) discrete @xmath2 symmetry@xcite of the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis indicated by maximal atmospheric mixing angle and small @xmath0 and ( b ) continuous @xmath3@xcite symmetry , which will be indicated if the mass hierarchy among neutrinos is inverted .    if neutrinos are majorana fermions , they are likely to acquire masses from very different mechanisms e.g. one of the various seesaw mechanisms which involve completely independent flavor structure ( say for example from right handed neutrinos ) than quarks .",
    "the apparent disparate pattern for quark and leptons mixings then need not argue against eventual quark - lepton unification .",
    "in fact there are now many grand unification models ( where quarks and leptons are unified at short distances ) where small quark mixings and large lepton mixings along with all their masses can be understood with very few assumptions in a seesaw framework@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the question as to whether there could be an apparently pure leptonic symmetry such as @xmath2 symmetry in the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis ( i.e. the basis where charged leptons are mass eigenstates ) , which is part of a general family symmetry within a quark - lepton unified framework such as a grand unified model .",
    "we particularly focus on this symmetry since there appears to be some hint in favor of this from the present mixing data . in the exact symmetry limit , the mixing parameter @xmath4@xcite and breaking of the symmetry not only implies a small nonzero value for @xmath0 but also leads to a correlation between @xmath0 with @xmath1 , which can be used to test for this idea@xcite .",
    "this question has been discussed at a phenomenological level in several recent papers@xcite but to the best of our knowledge no full - fledged gauge model has been constructed .",
    "indeed most gauge models for @xmath5 symmetry discussed in the literature treat leptons separately from quarks@xcite .",
    "one simple way to have quark flavor structure completely separated from that of leptons and yet have quark - lepton unification is to use the double seesaw@xcite framework where neutrino flavor texture from `` hidden sector '' singlet fermions ( e.g. so(10 ) singlets ) which are completely unrelated to quarks ( for examples of such models , see @xcite ) .",
    "one can then have any pure `` leptonic '' symmetry on the hidden singlets without at the same time interfering with quark flavor texture .",
    "a necessary feature of such models is that one must introduce new fermions into the model .",
    "a question therefore remains as to whether one could do this without expanding the matter sector . in this paper , we propose such an approach without introducing new fermions within a realistic su(5 ) gut framework that unifies quarks and leptons .",
    "we demand the full theory prior to symmetry breaking to obey a symmetry between the second and third generation ( or a generalized version of `` @xmath2 '' symmetry ) .",
    "the neutrino masses are assumed to arise from a triplet seesaw ( type ii)@xcite mechanism , which disentangles the neutrino flavor structure from the quark flavor structure .",
    "the quark mass matrices are however constrained by the @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "the quark mixing angles then introduce departures from exact @xmath2 symmetry results and lead to nonzero @xmath0 as well as departures from maximal atmospheric mixing .",
    "the model consists of a minimal set of higgs bosons which are anyway required to reconcile the charged fermion masses in the minimal su(5 ) model .",
    "we find that the requirement of @xmath2 symmetry for neutrinos can be imposed on the model without contradicting observed charged fermion masses and mixings . as noted",
    ", the model predicts a nonzero value for @xmath0 correlated with the departure of @xmath6 from its maximal value .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we present the su(5 ) model with @xmath2 symmetry ; in sec . 3 , we discuss coupling unification in the model since we have a new scale around @xmath7 gev to implement the type ii seesaw for neutrino masses .",
    "we close with concluding remarks in sec .",
    "as in the usual su(5 ) model , matter fields are assigned to @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 denotes the generation index ) .",
    "we choose the higgs fields to belong to the multiplets * 24 * ( denoted by @xmath11 and used to break the su(5 ) symmetry down to the standard model ) ; @xmath12 ( denoted by @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( denoted by @xmath15 ) used to give masses to fermions ) and @xmath16 ( denoted by @xmath17 ) to give masses to neutrinos via the type ii seesaw mechanism@xcite .",
    "the matter and higgs fields transform under the @xmath2 discrete flavor symmetry as follows : @xmath18 and all other fields are singlets under this transformation . in this model ,",
    "the matter part of the superpotential can be written as @xmath19    after the electro - weak symmetry breaking , the mass matrices for the standard model fermions are given by    @xmath20\\\\ m_u & = & y_{5}<h>=\\left[\\matrix{a&b&c\\cr b&d&e \\cr c&e&f}\\right]\\\\ m_d & = & y_{\\bar5}<\\bar h>+y_{45}<h>=\\left[\\matrix{a_1&b_1&c_1\\cr e_1&d_1&f_1\\cr e_1&d_1&f_1}\\right]+\\left[\\matrix{0&0&0\\cr e_2&d_2&f_2\\cr -e_2&-d_2&-f_2}\\right]\\\\ m_e & = & y^t_{\\bar5}<\\bar h>-3y^t_{45}<h>=\\left[\\matrix{a_1&e_1&e_1\\cr b_1&d_1&d_1\\cr c_1&f_1&f_1}\\right]-3\\left[\\matrix{0&e_2&-e_2\\cr 0&d_2&-d_2\\cr 0&f_2&-f_2}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the various parameters characterising the mass matrices are given in terms of the yukawa couplings and vacuum expectation values of fields as follows:@xmath21 are vevs of @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the mass matrices depend on nineteen parameters if we ignore cp phases and there are seventeen experimental inputs ( 6 quark masses , 3 charged lepton masses , two neutrino mass difference squares plus five mixing angles values and an upper limit on @xmath0 ) . for the sake of comparison , we note that if we generated neutrino masses in the standard model using a higgs triplet field , there would be 18 parameters in the absence of cp violation ( 9 from the quark sector , 3 from the charged lepton mass matrix and six from the neutrino sector ) . when one embeds the standard model into a gut su(5 ) , to be realistic , one needs to introduce * 45 * higgs and its associated yukawa couplings . in this case",
    ", the total number of parameters in the yukawa sector is 24 . in our model",
    "the requirement of @xmath2 symmetry has first led to a reduction in the total number by three and furthermore grand unification has strongly correlated the down quark and charged lepton mass matrix , as expected .",
    "it is therefore not obvious that the model will be consistent with known data on fermion masses .    to see if the model is phenomenologically acceptable , we first fit the masses of the charged leptons and down type quarks using the mass values of leptons and quarks at gut scale given in ref .",
    "@xcite :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values of parameters in the model are found by scanning the whole parameter space under the constraint that we satisfy the current experiment requirements of @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "note that since in this model , neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis is @xmath2 symmetric , it is diagonalized by the matrix : @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the solar mixing angle .",
    "the deviations of @xmath0 and @xmath6 from @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively should come from left - handed charged leptons mixing matrix .",
    "since these deviations have upper bounds , this puts an nontrivial constraint on the charged lepton mass matrix of the model ; but since the charged lepton mass matrix is already constrained by @xmath2 symmetry , it is nontrivial to get all masses and mixings to fit .",
    "it turns out that the fitting for the masses of leptons and quarks does not provide any bound on @xmath6 , however it gives quite stringent bound on @xmath0 . using the relation @xmath27 ,",
    "one can write @xmath28 and @xmath29 as @xmath30 the @xmath31 experimental bounds of @xmath0 and @xmath6 are @xcite @xmath32 the scatter plot in fig.1 gives @xmath33 as a function of sin@xmath34 allowing for 3 @xmath35 uncertainty in all masses except @xmath36 ( chosen to be @xmath37 mev ) , @xmath38 ( chosen to be @xmath39 mev ) and @xmath40 left free and @xmath6 within 3 @xmath35 .     and @xmath33 plane .",
    "67 percent of fitting points have @xmath41 and 80 percent have @xmath42 . ]    here , we give two typical fitting points for our model :    _ ( i ) case 1 : _",
    "@xmath43    @xmath44%\\label{ul}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for this case , we predict the following values for the neutrino mixing parameters @xmath0 and @xmath6 : @xmath45    _ ( ii ) case 2 : _    @xmath46    @xmath47\\label{ul}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    giving us @xmath48 we therefore note that the value of the most probable value for @xmath0 is in the range from @xmath49 with ( as indicated in fig .",
    "2 ) values below @xmath50 being much more probable .",
    "note that mass @xmath40 in both cases has almost same magnitude as @xmath36 and is smaller than the central value at the gut scale by about @xmath51 .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath52 is @xmath2 odd , leading to zero entries in the @xmath53 .",
    "note that in this model , we also have additional threshold correction from the exchange of the gauginos , which make larger contribution to quarks relative to the charged leptons of the corresponding generation due to strong coupling of the gluinos .",
    "in particular , the gluino contribution to the tree level masses of the quarks can be significant if the assumption of proportionality between the a - terms and the yukawa couplings is abandoned .",
    "3 gives a typical feynman diagram contributing to the quark masses@xcite .",
    "the generic contribution to the @xmath54 element of the down quark mass matrix is given by :     quark mass due to gluino - squark exchange . ]",
    "@xmath55    including this radiative correction only in the @xmath56 element of the down quark mass matrix , one can get the down quark mass to be in agreement with observations .",
    "we also note that the process of fitting the charged lepton and down quark masses gives a definite rotation matrix that diagonalizes the down quark mass matrix and contributes to the @xmath57 .",
    "we then appropriately choose the parameters in the symmetric up - quark mass matrix so that we get the correct @xmath57 .",
    "the dashed lines in the figure show the pure mssm running.[fig : gaugerunning ] ]    this type - ii seesaw requires that we have a medium scale for the mass of the sm triplet higgs which is present in * 15 * -higgs i.e. @xmath58 ; this is satisfied if we tune the coupling @xmath59 of @xmath60 to @xmath61 or so since @xmath62 .",
    "once @xmath11 get vev and breaks @xmath63 to standard model , it also can induce the mass splitting of multiplets of @xmath64 .",
    "this will affect the unification of coupling .",
    "we display the effect of these mass splittings to the gauge coupling running as a threshold correction , in fig.[fig : gaugerunning ] and show that the unification of couplings is maintained and we get a slight increment in the value of @xmath65 gev .",
    "we also like to comment that a more economical possibility is to consider a model that uses a high dimension operator involving with @xmath11 instead of the @xmath52 .",
    "the matter part of the superpotenial in this case is given by : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is planck scale and @xmath68 is the @xmath63 adjoint representation used to break @xmath63 to @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70,vev of @xmath52 is @xmath71 and vev of @xmath72 is @xmath73 , thus the overall scale of the contribution of this higher dimensional operator to fermion mass matrices @xmath74 .",
    "we have tried a fitting of data for this model and find it to be unacceptable , since it gives very large @xmath75 which is around 4 - 5 @xmath35 .",
    "an interesting possibility is to embed the @xmath2 symmetry into an @xmath76 symmetry .",
    "there are two reasons one may consider such an extension .",
    "first is that the neutrino mass matrix of the form that originates from the @xmath77 coupling is then given by :    @xmath78    which reproduces the interesting tri - bi - maximal mixing pattern@xcite which seems to be in very good accord with current data .",
    "su(5 ) embedding could then provide corrections to the tri - bi - maximal mixing .",
    "however , mixing matrix obtained from eq.[tbm1 ] is arbitrary up to a rotation in the 1 - 3 space due to the fact that the first and the third generations are degenerate . if we add to this matrix the following @xmath2 symmetric but @xmath76 breaking matrix of the form : @xmath79 this however breaks the @xmath76 symmetry by a large amount .",
    "the second interesting point about the @xmath76 embedding is that that in the symmetry limit , the su(5 ) model conserves r - parity automatically , making the dark matter naturally stable since the term @xmath80 is forbidden by the symmetry .",
    "in summary , we have discussed the grand unification of apparently pure leptonic symmetries such as @xmath2 symmetry into the quark - lepton unifying supersymmetric su(5 ) model for quarks and leptons and studied its implications for neutrino mixing angles .",
    "we find that it is possible to have a completely viable su(5 ) model of this type . in this model",
    "the neutrino masses arise from a triplet vev induced type ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "the presence of quark lepton unification leads to small deviations from maximal atmospheric mixing angle and vanishing @xmath0 implied in the exact symmetry limit .",
