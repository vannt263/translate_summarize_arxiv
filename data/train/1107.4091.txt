    "astronomical spectrographs are used for a variety of high - precision measurements , ranging from the discovery of low mass exoplanets to the possible variation of fundamental constants , such as the fine structure constant @xcite or the proton - electron mass ratio @xcite .",
    "these works require excellent wavelength calibration sources and a detailed understanding of the associated uncertainties and systematics . in the era of extremely large telescopes ( elts ) it is often the accuracy of the calibration source , not the intrinsic photon noise , that limits the achievable precision .",
    "furthermore , the science goals of future elts will require very high - precision calibration sources .",
    "below @xmath17 nm , the well - established thorium - argon ( th / ar ) hollow cathode lamps have been a workhorse  @xcite .",
    "continual improvements in the line list have now enabled th lamps to be used to calibrate almost the entire optical bandpass with high precision .",
    "in contrast to the optical , the near infrared ( nir ) does not yet have a widely - used calibrator like th / ar ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . @xcite",
    "have provided an atlas of th / ar lines in the nir , which is sufficient for precisions of @xmath18 m / s on crires ( cryogenic high - resolution infrared echelle spectrograph ) @xcite , but the density of th lines is relatively low in the nir , and many of the thorium lines are very weak .",
    "better precisions of @xmath19 m / s to @xmath20 m / s have been achieved by with telluric co@xmath21 lines , and @xmath22 m / s by @xcite with an ammonia ( nh@xmath23 ) gas cell in the k band .",
    "such calibration techniques are suitable for specific problems , but are only useful over specific ranges of the nir .",
    "an ideal emission calibration source would cover the observed spectrum in a forest of isolated lines of similar intensity , with the intrinsic wavelength of each line known to a high degree of precision .",
    "laser frequency combs are such a calibration source  @xcite , but there are numerous technical hurdles before these systems will be considered turn - key : they are expensive to build and operate , they have yet to demonstrate the long - term stability and desired wavelength coverage for the nir .",
    "hollow cathode lamps , being significantly less expensive and easier to use , are the preferred wavelength calibration solution for most astrophysical spectrographs .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a comprehensive review of the design , construction , and operation of hollow cathode lamps .",
    "thorium ( @xmath24th ) , an element often used as the cathode for such lamps , exhibits many of the desired characteristics of an atomic emission calibration source : it has many energy levels ( leading to many lines ) , a heavy nucleus , a very long half - life , and occurs in nature as a single isotope .",
    "uranium shares all of these characteristics except for the last : it has three naturally - occurring isotopes , the major component being uranium-238 ( 99.275% ) , with much smaller amounts of uranium-@xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and uranium-@xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) @xcite .",
    "these isotopes could limit the achievable precision , but the second - most abundant isotope , uranium-@xmath25 , has hyperfine structure , so the fine structure transitions are spread over several lines and are thus much less intense . for practical purposes ,",
    "all of the uranium lines are observed as `` single '' lines in the fts spectra . in this paper",
    "we propose an inexpensive and simple solution to the calibration problem in the nir : the use of uranium hollow cathode lamps , which provide a high density of emission lines across the nir spectral region .",
    "prior works have noted that uranium might prove a higher line density calibration source than thorium @xcite .",
    "experiments with a variety of metals and fill gases in hollow cathode lamps on the pathfinder spectrographic testbed @xcite between @xmath29 @xmath7 m and @xmath30 @xmath7 m confirms this .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparison ] shows @xmath31-second exposures of th / ar , u / ar , and u / ne obtained with pathfinder . all lamps were run at @xmath32 ma and share the same optical alignment .",
    "in addition to the greater line density of uranium lines , we note that neon lines in our u / ne spectra are much less intense than argon lines in our u / ar spectra .",
    "these results are typical for our observations in the nir .    using archival fourier",
    "transform spectrometer ( fts ) data from the kitt peak national solar observatory ( hereafter , nso ) , we have identified @xmath0uranium lines between @xmath33 @xmath7 m and @xmath34 @xmath7 m , most of which are below @xmath35 @xmath7 m .",
    "this line list complements work by @xcite , who provided uranium identifications for bright uranium lines from @xmath36 @xmath2 down to @xmath37 @xmath2 ( @xmath38 to @xmath39  ) , and @xcite , who compiled a list of uranium lines between @xmath40 @xmath7 m and @xmath41 @xmath7 m .",
    "our goal is to provide the astrophysical community with a list of largely unblended wavelength standards that can be used for the calibration of current and future nir spectrographs .    in  [ sec : data ] we describe the archival fts data from which we derived our measurements and line lists , and in  [ sec : linelist ] we describe the construction of the line lists , and the determination of uncertainties . in  [ sec : results ] we present the results of this line list , and in  [ sec : discussion ] we compare our line list to historical uranium line lists and to recent thorium line lists . in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the observations used for our measurements were made with the @xmath29-m fts on kitt peak @xcite between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and are publicly available on the nso website .",
    "we selected two high - current u / ar spectra taken with insb detectors , two low - current u / ar spectra to check for plasma shifts , and one high - current u / ne spectrum to search for lines above @xmath44 @xmath2 .",
    "plasma shifts in this paper refer to line shifts from some combination of effects including : collisions with neutral atoms , electrons , and ions , and stark effect due to static electric fields , and in the case of ion lines the doppler effect due to ion drift motion .",
    "a summary of these data can be found in table  [ ftsobs ] .",
    "the first column is the spectrum number ( shorthand which is used throughout the text ) .",
    "the second column is the name of the archive data file ( the first six digits indicate the year , month , and day of the observations , respectively , and the last three indicate the spectrum number of that day ) .",
    "the third column is the lamp type ( either uranium neon or uranium argon ) .",
    "column four is the lamp current in milliamps ( ma ) .",
    "the wavenumber range of the observation is given in the next two columns .",
    "column seven is the wavenumber correction factor ( @xmath45 , defined below ) applied to each spectrum , and column eight is the standard error of the mean in that factor ( both divided by @xmath46 for readability ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : kerber ] * notes . * a comparison between the number of thorium lines found by @xcite and the number of uranium lines found in this work .",
    "lines without identifications from this work ( indicated with a `` * ? * ''",
    "symbol in the line list ) are not accounted for in this table .",
    "note that this is not a comparison between the true number of lines that these two sources provide in these regions , but rather a snapshot of the current number of known lines .",
    "we have measured @xmath0uranium lines in the nir , which represents a significant increase in the number of calibration lines over the current nir emission standard , th / ar . this line list has been generated specifically with astronomical applications in mind  we have taken care to avoid blended lines , and where we could not do so , we have indicated suspected or likely blends in the table .",
    "we anticipate this line list will be useful on several upcoming astronomical spectrographs , including apogee @xcite , carmenes @xcite , and ishell @xcite .",
