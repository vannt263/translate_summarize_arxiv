    "<S> considering stationary states of continuous - variable systems undergoing an open dynamics , we unveil the connection between properties and symmetries of the latter and the dynamical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we explore the relation between the lyapunov equation for dynamical systems and the steady - state solutions of a time - independent lindblad master equation for bosonic modes . exploiting bona - fide relations that characterize some genuine quantum properties ( entanglement , classicality , and steerability ) , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain conditions on the dynamical parameters for which the system is driven to a steady - state possessing such properties . </S>",
    "<S> we also develop a method to capture the symmetries of a steady state based on symmetries of the lyapunov equation . </S>",
    "<S> all the results and examples can be useful for steady - state engineering process .    </S>",
    "<S> the manipulation of the environment affecting the dynamics of a quantum system , with the aim of driving the latter towards a specific state , embodies a valuable tool for quantum state engineering . depending on assumptions about the couplings </S>",
    "<S> , the open dynamics can lead to either an equilibrium state or a dynamical steady - state . on the other hand , in this scenario , it is critical to ensure that the desired state is achieved regardless the fluctuations in the initial state of the system . protocols of this sort are know as reservoir engineering , stabilization , and design  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a standard approach to the modelling of the evolution of an open system is the lindblad master equation ( ) for the density operator @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath1            - \\frac{1}{2\\hbar } \\ ! </S>",

    "<S> the is the most general type of markovian and time - homogeneous master equation guaranteeing trace preservation and complete positivity . despite the fundamental and very restrictive markovianity assumption , the is crucial for the description of an ample set of dynamics in quantum optics and information , mesoscopic physics , and quantum chemistry  @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we investigate properties and symmetries of continuous - variable states driven to equilibrium by a linear evolution governed by the time - independent lindblad dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> gaussian states , which play a preponderant role in quantum information science and are the natural candidates for the implementation of quantum computation with continuous variables @xcite , belong to such set of states .    from the mathematical point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the problem of whether a linear has a stable steady - state is equivalent to the solution of a lyapunov equation for the covariance matrix of the quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> the methodology used to solve lyapunov equations , known as lyapunov stability theory @xcite , was developed in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> , we make use of the connection between the and the lyapunov theory to determine several properties of continuous variables steady - states , such as classicality @xcite , separability @xcite ( or bound entanglement @xcite ) , and steerability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , we also explore the steady - state symmetries induced by the dynamical symmetries of the lyapunov equation . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly interesting , as it is in general hard to characterize the symmetries of the states working directly on the ( [ lindblad ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this task becomes instead fully manageable when dealing with finite matrices . </S>",
    "<S> our results are applicable to systems with a generic number of degrees of freedom and their analyticity brings in turn robustness for numerical examinations of the mentioned properties .    the remaining of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  </S>",
