    "directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite is an anisotropic variant of the usual isotropic percolation ( ip )  @xcite in which an effect or activity can percolate only along a given preferred ( longitudinal ) direction .",
    "dp is perhaps the simplest model leading to self - affine fractals .",
    "it has many potential applications , including fluid flow through porous media under gravity , hopping conductivity in a strong electric field  @xcite , crack propagation  @xcite , and the propagation of surfaces at depinning transitions in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is related to self - organized critical models  @xcite .",
    "often the longitudinal direction is viewed as time and dp is interpreted as a spreading process . in this dynamic interpretation dp has become famous as the the generic universality class for phase transitions between an active and an absorbing inactive state  @xcite .",
    "the perhaps most intuitive spreading process belonging to the dp universality class is the so called simple epidemic process ( sep ) . in epidemic processes , individuals",
    "( also referred to as particles and for simplicity assumed to be located on the sites of a @xmath1-dimensional lattice ) are either susceptible , infected or immune . at time @xmath2",
    "an infected particle can randomly infect any of its susceptible neighbors with a certain activation rate . at @xmath3",
    "the newly infected particles are capable of infecting their susceptible neighbors and so on . with a certain deactivation rate",
    "any infected particle may become immune . depending on the difference @xmath4 between the activation and the deactivation rate ,",
    "the process is endemic or epidemic . for @xmath5",
    "the process dies out after a finite time . for @xmath6",
    "the process spreads over the entire lattice and approaches a homogenous steady state .",
    "the point @xmath7 marks a non - equilibrium phase transition .",
    "there are 2 basic variants of epidemic processes . in the sep",
    "there is a chance that an immune particle becomes susceptible again .",
    "the spatio - temporal patterns generated by the sep are dp clusters  @xcite .",
    "if immune particles remain immune at all times , one has the so called general epidemic process ( gep ) .",
    "the clusters of immune particles generated by the gep are ip clusters .",
    "since dp represents the generic universality class for phase transitions into absorbing inactive states , it frequently occurs that work on non - equilibrium phase transitions addresses the question , whether a given system belongs to the dp universality class or not .",
    "usually this is done via the fluctuation induced anomalous critical exponents . however , directly at the upper critical dimension , i.e. , in @xmath0 transversal dimensions for dp , the leading scaling behavior is purely of mean - field - type and there are no anomalous critical exponents .",
    "however , fluctuations lead logarithmic corrections to the mean - field behavior . just as the anomalous critical exponents , the logarithmic corrections can be used to decide if a given system belongs to the dp universality class . with the computer resources available today , numerical simulation on non - equilibrium systems explore more and more often high spatial dimensions . simulations with reliable statistics of such systems in 4 dimensions are within reach today .",
    "hence , we feel that it becomes important to know logarithmic corrections for the dp universality class .",
    "the leading logarithmic corrections are fairly easy to extract from the known renormalization group ( rg ) results on dp .",
    "astonishingly , this has not been done to date , at least to our knowledge .",
    "it has to be expected , though , that knowing the leading logarithmic corrections is not sufficient to obtain a decent agreement between theory and simulations .",
    "this expectation is based on the experiences that have been made for another system for which logarithmic correction have been studied intensively by numerical and analytical means , viz .",
    "linear polymers  @xcite",
    ". numerical work on dp in @xmath0 in progress seems to corroborate our expectation  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive analytically logarithmic correction for dp up to and including the next to leading order .",
    "we focus three dynamical observables that are well suited for investigation by numerical simulations , namely the number @xmath8 of infected particles at time @xmath2 generated by a seed at the spatio - temporal origin @xmath9 , their mean distance @xmath10 from the origin ( radius of gyration ) as well as he survival probability @xmath11 of the corresponding cluster .",
    "furthermore , we determine logarithmic corrections for the dp equation of state ( eqs ) that relates the homogeneous particle density @xmath12 of the stationary state to @xmath4 and an auxiliary constant homogeneous particle source @xmath13 . for dimensions below 4 ,",
    "this eqs is known to 2-loop order  @xcite .",
    "its logarithmic correction have not been addressed hitherto .",
    "of course , logarithmic corrections to dynamic quantities like @xmath8 are not only relevant for dp ; they are likewise important for dynamic ip at the respective upper critical dimension 6 . for logarithmic corrections to dynamic ip",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite . also , logarithmic correction influence the static properties of ip clusters , like for example their various fractal dimensions , and their transport properties . for logarithmic corrections in static ip , see ref .  @xcite .",

    "[ reviewdp ] we briefly review the sep as a dynamic model for dp .",
    "we sketch the renormalized field theory of the sep and cite previous rg results .",
    "furthermore , we explain by solving the rg equation in @xmath0 how logarithmic corrections arise in dp . in section  [ logcorr ]",
    "we derive the logarithmic corrections for the aforementioned dynamic observables .",
    "section  [ eqs ] treats logarithmic corrections of the mean - field equation of state . in sec .",
    "[ concludingremarks ] we give a few concluding remarks .",
    "details of our diagrammatic perturbation calculation are relegated to an appendix .",
    "this section is intended to provide the reader with background on the dynamical field theory of dp and to establish notation .",
    "moreover , it demonstrates how logarithmic correction emerge in the rg framework by solving the rg equation directly in d=4 .",
    "there are basically two complimentary approaches to model dp .",
    "the first approach is based on bond percolation and assigns a direction to the bonds .",
    "an example for this kind of model is the random resistor diode network , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . in the other approach one models",

    ", we will take the latter route",
    ".    on mesoscopic scales it makes sense to describe the sep in terms of the density @xmath14 of infected particles at time @xmath2 and space coordinate @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that the langevin equation ( in the ito sense ) governing the time evolution of this density is given by   @xcite    [ langandnoise]@xmath16    the parameter @xmath4 is essentially the rate difference mentioned in the introduction and hence specifies the deviation from criticality .",

    "( [ langandnoise ] ) that are of higher order in the field or the derivatives turn out to be irrelevant in the sense of the rg .",
    "for example , a diffusional noise contribution can be neglected .",
    "langevin equations are fairly intuitive and thus provide a natural starting point in the mesoscopic description of stochastic processes .",
    "prevalent alternative forms of mesoscopic description are fokker - planck equations as well as dynamic functionals  @xcite .",
    "dynamic functionals , also known as response functionals , are best suited for the application of field theory and rg ideas .",
    "this is the form of description that we will use here .",
    "the dynamic functional @xmath20 for dp has been known for a long time  @xcite . after exploiting a rescaling form - invariance that allows to equate @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath20 can be written as @xmath23 the order parameter field @xmath24 is proportional to particle density @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath25 is the response field corresponding to @xmath24 .",
    "time reflection , also known as duality transformation , @xmath26 is a symmetry transformation of the dynamic functional  @xcite .",
    "this , however , is merely an asymptotic symmetry that holds provided that irrelevant terms are absent . when applying rg ideas to calculate leading scaling scaling properties or logarithmic corrections , one has to make sure that this symmetry is preserved",
    "on the other hand , if one is interested in corrections to scaling stemming from irrelevant contributions to the functional  ( [ funkt ] ) , then one has to admit composite fields that break the symmetry  ( [ zeitsp . ] ) .",
    "the great virtue of response functional @xmath20 is that it allows for systematic perturbation calculation in the coupling constant @xmath21 that resembles many features of , and allows to glean techniques from , the well established diagrammatic perturbation treatments of equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "the most economic way to actually do these calculations is to use dimensional regularization in conjunction with minimal subtraction ( minimal renormalization ) . for background on these methods",

    "the idea behind this method is to consider all the scaling parameters as a function of a single flow parameter @xmath48 .",
    "one sets sets up characteristic equations that describe how the scaling parameters transform under a change of @xmath48 .",
    "the characteristic for the momentum scale @xmath30 is particularly simple and has the solution @xmath49 , i.e. , a change of @xmath48 corresponds to a change of the external momentum scale . with help of the solution to the remaining characteristics one obtains @xmath50^{(n+\\tilde{n})/2}\\\\ &   \\times\\,g_{n,\\tilde{n}}(\\{l\\mu\\mathbf{x},z_{\\lambda}(l)(l\\mu)^{2}\\lambda t\\};z_{\\tau}(l)\\tau/(\\mu l)^{2},\\bar{u}(l);1,1)\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a solution to the rge . at this stage",
    "the scaling solution  ( [ grfuskal ] ) is still rather formal since @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 require specification .",
