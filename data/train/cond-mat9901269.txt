    "the time evolution of the survival probability @xmath3 of particles diffusing in a @xmath4dimensional space in the presence of immobile , randomly placed traps has been widely discussed in the physical and mathematical literature within the last two decades .",
    "an interest in this problem has been inspired by the evident physical significance of the subject ( excitation and charge motion , photoconductivity , photosynthesis ) .",
    "further on , such an interest has been stimulated by an important observation @xcite that @xmath3 exhibits a non - mean - field long - time behavior , which is intimately related to the so - called lifschitz singularities near the edge of the band in the density of states of a particle in quantum lorentz gas and is reflected in the moment generating function of the so - called wiener sausage @xcite .",
    "later works ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have also pointed out the relevance of the issue to percolation , self  avoiding random walks or self  attracting polymers , as well as to the anomalous behavior of the ground  state energy of a witten s toy hamiltonian in supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "various analytical techniques have been elaborated to calculate @xmath3 , including an extension of the `` optimal fluctuation '' method @xcite , different methods of evaluating upper and lower bounds ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , green functions approaches @xcite , field ",
    "theoretic treatments @xcite , as well as a variety of mean  field  type descriptions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these studies have revealed a two - stage decay pattern of the form [ p ] p(t ) \\ {    lll - n_tr _",
    "d(t ) , & t_mt t_c , & ( a ) + - n_tr^2/(d+2 ) t^d/(d+2 ) , & t t_c , & ( b )    . where @xmath5 denotes the mean density of traps",
    ", @xmath6 is a microscopic time scale and @xmath7 denotes the crossover time between the intermediate ( a ) and long  time ( b ) kinetic stages .",
    "further on , the function @xmath8 appearing in eq.([p].a ) defines the mean volume of the so - called wiener sausage ( see , e.g. @xcite)i.e . the mean volume swept by a diffusive spherical particle during time @xmath1 .",
    "its discrete - space counterpart , i.e. an analog of @xmath8 defined for lattice random walks , is referred to as the mean number of distinct sites visited by a particle up to the time @xmath1 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the functional form of @xmath8 is different for different spatial dimensions @xmath4 and obeys : [ ph ] _",

    "it has been understood that eqs.([p].a ) and ( [ p].b ) are supported by completely different realizations of random walk trajectories : the intermediate ",
    "time behavior described by eq.([p].a ) is associated with typical realizations of random walk trajectories and is consistent with the predictions of the mean  field , smoluchowski  type approaches @xcite ; namely , @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 is the so - called smoluchowski constant , which equals the diffusive current through the surface of an immobile @xmath4-dimensional sphere . on the other hand , the long  time asymptotical form in eq.([p].b ) showing a slower time  dependence compared to the intermediate  time decay law , stems from the interplay between fluctuations in the spatial distribution of traps ( namely , on the existence of rare but sufficiently large trap  free cavities ) , and atypical realizations of random walk trajectories which do not leave such cavities during the time of observation .",
    "note also that eq.([p].b ) describes the anomalous long  time tail of the moment generating function for the wiener sausage volume @xcite .    due to the general interest in fractal structures as useful approximate models of disordered media , and/or anomalous diffusion , eq.([p ] ) has been extended @xcite to describe trapping of random walkers on random or regular structures characterized , in the general case , by a non - integer spatial dimension @xmath11 and anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath12 , the latter being defined through the relation describing the time - dependence of the second moment of the particle s displacement , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 may be different from the value @xmath15 , which holds for conventional diffusive motion in euclidean @xmath4dimensional space @xcite . for such systems heuristic agruments @xcite suggest that @xmath3 follows an asymptotic behavior of the form [ pu ] p(t ) \\ {    lll -n_tr _ d(t ) , & t_mt t_c , & ( a ) + -n_tr^d_w/(d_f+d _ ) t^d_f/(d_f+d _ ) , & t t_c , & ( b )    . with [ phtilde ] _",

    "note , that here @xmath11 can attain integer values and @xmath14 may be set equal to @xmath16 , which leads to conventional diffusive motion in euclidean space ; then eq.([pu ] ) reduces to eq.([p ] ) .",
    "the decay patterns as in eqs.([pu ] ) and ( [ phtilde ] ) have been verified numerically for different types of fractal systems , such as , e.g. , sierpinski gaskets or percolation clusters @xcite .",
    "however , rigorous results describing the evolution of @xmath3 in systems showing anomalous diffusion are lacking at present .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a particular case of trapping ; we consider reactions in systems in which the random motion of a particle moving in presence of randomly placed , immobile traps is non  markovian , but , nonetheless , its survival probability can be determined exactly starting from first principles .",
    "more specifically , we consider a situation in which a mobile particle ( referred to in what follows as a slip  link ) is located at the end of a long polymer chain diffusing in three - dimensional space and is constrained to move along a one  dimensional line containing randomly placed perfect traps ( [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the chain is modeled as a sequence of @xmath17 beads connected by phantom elastic springs and its dynamics is described within the framework of the customary rouse model @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we formulate the model . in section 3",
    "we discuss briefly the exact solution for the survival of a particle which diffuses on a line in the presence of randomly distributed traps , and then rederive this solution in terms of a path  integral method . in section 4",
    "we describe , following @xcite the path integral formalism for evaluating the measure of trajectories covered by a tagged bead of a rouse chain .",
    "next , we show how such a formalism can be applied for the exact computation of the probability that the slip ",
    "link is not trapped until time @xmath1 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we conclude with a summary and discussion of the obtained results .",
    "consider a polymer chain embedded in three  dimensional space and consisting of @xmath17 beads ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) , which are connected sequentially by phantom harmonic springs of rigidity @xmath18 .",
    "the rigidity can be also expressed as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the temperature ( written in units of the boltzmann constant @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 is the mean equilibrium distance between beads .",
    "further more , the positions of all beads are denoted by @xmath23 , where the subscript @xmath24 enumerates the beads along the chain , @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "all beads , except the slip  link ( @xmath26 ) , may move freely in 3d . on contrary",
    ", we stipulate that the slip ",
    "link is constrained to move only along the @xmath27axis , such that its position in space is given solely by the @xmath27component of the vector @xmath28 , since @xmath29 and @xmath30 must always equal zero .",
    "then the potential energy @xmath31 of such a chain is given by    [ potential ] u(\\{_j})= _ j=0^n-1 ( _ j+1-_j)^2 =    next , apart from the holonomic constraints imposed by the springs , the beads experience the action of random forces @xmath32 .",
    "these random forces are assumed to be gaussian and uncorrelated in time and space ; their cartesian components @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , obey : [ noise ]    l = 0 , + = 2 t _",
    "j , j _ , ",
    "( t - t ) ,    where the bar stands for averaging over thermal histories and @xmath35 is the macroscopic friction coefficient .    in the absence of",
    "excluded  volume effects , the dynamics of the rouse chain is guided by the corresponding langevin ",
    "rouse equations @xcite [ rl ] _",
    "j = -+ _ j(t ) , where the dot denotes the time derivative . as one can verify readily , for the potential energy given by eq.([potential ] ) the equations for the @xmath36 decouple with respect to the cartesian components .",
    "that is , the dynamics of , say , @xmath37 , is independent of @xmath38 and @xmath39 and reads [ rl ] _",
    "j = k ( x_j+1 + x_j-1 - 2 x_j ) + f_j , x(t ) , which equation holds for @xmath40 . on the other hand , the displacements of the chain s extremities along the @xmath27-axis ,",
    "i.e. @xmath41 and @xmath42 , obey _ 0 = k ( x_1 - x_0 ) + f_0,x(t ) , and _",
    "n = k ( x_n-1 - x_n ) + f_n , x(t ) hence , with regards to polymer dynamics , one faces an effectively one  dimensional model .",
    "lastly , we suppose that the @xmath17axis contains perfect , immobile traps , which are placed at random positions with mean density @xmath5 .",
    "the positions of the traps are denoted by @xmath43 , @xmath44 . according to our model , the traps influence the dynamics of the polymer only by trapping ( immobilising ) the slip  link at the encounter .",
    "the influence of the trap on the other beads ( i.e. such that @xmath45 $ ] ) is indirect : as soon as the slip",
    " link gets immobilised by any of the traps , the chain becomes anchored as a whole due to the links between the chain s monomers .",
    "our aim is to compute exactly the time evolution of the probability , @xmath0 , that a polymer chain with a slip  link sliding along the @xmath27axis will not encounter any of the traps ( and thus will remain mobile until time @xmath1 ) .",
    "it seems instructive to recall first the time evolution of the survival probability in the simplest case , for @xmath46 , i.e. for a single chemically active monomer diffusing on a one - dimensional line and reacting with randomly placed , immobile traps .",
    "it is intuitively clear that for a rouse chain containing @xmath17 beads , we should recover ( apart from the renormalization of the diffusion coefficient ) at sufficiently long times the behavior predicted for a single monomer , because for a finite chain the random motion of any of the chain s beads ultimately follows the conventional diffusion of the chain s center - of - mass @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , at shorter times substantial deviations between the motion of the monomer and of the center  of  mass are to be found , due to the essentially non - diffusive characted of the slip  link motion , induced by the internal degrees of freedom of the polymer .",
    "this anomalous regime stemming from the internal relaxation modes of the chain will cause significant departures from the decay forms described by eq.([p ] ) .",
    "the derivation of decay laws associated with this anomalous regime is the primary goal of the present paper and will be discussed in the next section .",
    "as one may expect , in one  dimensional systems the situation simplifies considerably , since here the diffusive particle can react only with two neighboring traps and thus can not leave the intertrap interval .",
    "this renders the problem exactly solvable , reducing it to the analysis of the particle survival inside a finite interval , followed by averaging over the distribution of the intertrap intervals .",
    "we outline such a calculation following the seminal method of ref.@xcite .",
    "we calculate first the probability @xmath47 that a diffusive particle ( whose diffusion coefficient is @xmath48 ) , which starts at @xmath49 will not encounter the traps at @xmath50 and at @xmath51 until time @xmath1 .",
    "this probability follows as the solution of the following one  dimensional boundary problem : [ 1d ] \\ {    l = d + ( x , x(0),t|l)|_x=0=(x , x(0),t|l)|_x = l=0 + ( x , x(0),t=0|l)=(x - x(0 ) )    . the solution of eqs.([1d ] ) can be readily found by standard means and takes the form of a fourier series : [ series ] ( x , x(0),t|l)= _",
    "n = 1^ ( - ) ( ) ( ) , now , to compute the monomer survival probability we turn to the position  averaged function [ psi ] ( t|l)= _ 0^l _ 0^l dx(0 ) dx ( x , x(0),t|l ) , which can be computed from eq.([series ] ) and reads [ ipsi ] ( t|l ) = _ l = 0^ ( 2 l + 1)^-2 ( - ) next , the desired survival probability of the diffusive monomer @xmath3 is determined as the convolution [ surv ] p(t)=_0^ dl _",

    "in this subsection we rederive the solution of the monomer trapping problem in terms of the path  integral formalism , which will be later used to determine the trapping kinetics of the slip  link . to do this",
    ", we will proceed as follows :    we first write the solution of eq.([1d ] ) as an integral over brownian paths @xmath55 : [ 1d_1 ] ( x , x(0),t|l)= .",
