    "the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) so far has met all experimental challenges and is now tested at the @xmath5 level  @xcite . however , there is little direct experimental information on the mechanism which generates the masses of the weak gauge bosons . in the sm ,",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is responsible for mass generation .",
    "the existence of a higgs boson is a direct consequence of this mechanism . at present",
    "the negative result of direct searches performed at lep2 imposes a lower bound of @xmath6  gev  @xcite on the higgs boson mass .",
    "indirect information on the mass of the higgs boson can be extracted from the @xmath7 dependence of radiative corrections to the @xmath1 boson mass , @xmath8 , and the effective weak mixing angle , @xmath9 . assuming the sm to be valid , a global fit to all available electroweak precision data yields a 95% confidence level upper limit on @xmath7 of 188  gev  @xcite .    in order to extract more accurate information on @xmath7 from electroweak data",
    ", it is very important to measure @xmath8 more precisely .",
    "currently , the @xmath1 boson mass is known to @xmath10  mev  @xcite from direct measurements .",
    "further improvement in the @xmath1 mass uncertainty is expected from this years lep  ii data taking , and run  ii of the tevatron  @xcite which is scheduled to begin in march  2001 .",
    "the ultimate precision expected for @xmath8 from the combined lep2 experiments is approximately 35  mev  @xcite . at the tevatron , integrated luminosities of order 2  fb@xmath11",
    "are foreseen for run  ii , and one expects to measure the @xmath1 mass with a precision of approximately 40  mev  @xcite per experiment and decay channel .",
    "preliminary studies indicate that measuring @xmath8 at the lhc with an with a precision of 25  mev  @xcite per experiment and decay channel should be possible , although very challenging .    in order to measure the @xmath1 boson mass with high precision in a hadron collider environment ,",
    "it is necessary to fully understand and control higher order qcd and electroweak ( ew ) corrections to @xmath1 production .",
    "the determination of the @xmath1 mass in a hadron collider environment requires a simultaneous precision measurement of the @xmath2 boson mass , @xmath12 , and width , @xmath13 .",
    "when compared to the value measured at lep , the two quantities help to accurately determine the energy scale and resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter , and to constrain the muon momentum resolution  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore also necessary to understand the higher order ew corrections to @xmath2 boson production in hadronic collisions .",
    "accurate predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 production which include the complete @xmath3 corrections are also needed for a measurement of the @xmath1 cross section , the @xmath14 cross section ratio , the determination of the @xmath1 width , and for extracting @xmath9 from the forward backward asymmetry in the @xmath2 peak region .",
    "in addition , precise calculations of the drell - yan cross section are needed in searches for new physics beyond the sm , such as hidden extra dimensions or additional @xmath2 bosons .    in a previous calculation of the ew",
    "radiative corrections to @xmath1 and @xmath2 production , only the final state photonic corrections were correctly included  @xcite .",
    "the sum of the soft and virtual parts was estimated from the inclusive @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) width and the hard photon bremsstrahlung contribution .",

    "@xcite , combined with effects of multiple photon emission , have been estimated to contribute a systematic uncertainty of @xmath20  mev to the measurement of the @xmath1 mass in run  i  @xcite . clearly , in order to achieve the accuracies envisioned for run  ii and the lhc , improved theoretical calculations are required .",
    "recently , new and more accurate calculations of the @xmath0 ew corrections to @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath2 boson production in hadronic collisions  @xcite became available . in this",
    "talk i present an overview of these calculations .",
    "they include most of the contributions which were previously ignored . in section  [ sec : two ] i briefly describe the calculation of the @xmath3 ew corrections to @xmath2 boson and high mass drell - yan production . in section  [ sec :",
    "three ] i summarize the results of ref .  @xcite . in section  [ sec : four ] i present a brief summary and outlook .",
    "for @xmath22 , the pure qed corrections form a separately gauge invariant set of diagrams . the first step towards a full calculation of the @xmath3 corrections to @xmath2 boson production",
    "thus consists of performing a calculation of the pure qed corrections .",
    "the diagrams contributing to the @xmath3 qed corrections can be separated into gauge invariant subsets corresponding to initial and final state corrections .    to perform the calculation , a monte carlo method for next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculations similar to that described in ref .",
    "@xcite was used . with the monte carlo method , it is easy to calculate a variety of observables simultaneously and to simulate detector response .",
    "the collinear singularities associated with final state photon radiation are regulated by the mass of the leptons .",
    "the associated mass singular logarithms of the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the squared parton center of mass energy and @xmath25 is the charged lepton mass , are included in our calculation , but the very small terms of @xmath26 are neglected .",
    "the collinear singularities associated with initial state photon radiation can be removed by universal collinear counter terms generated by `` renormalizing '' the parton distribution functions ( pdf s )  @xcite , in complete analogy to gluon emission in qcd .",
    "in addition to the collinear counterterms , finite terms can be absorbed into the pdf s , introducing a qed factorization scheme dependence .",
    "we have carried out our calculation in the qed @xmath27 and qed @xmath28 scheme . in order to treat the @xmath3 initial state qed corrections to @xmath2 boson production in hadronic collisions in a consistent way",
    ", qed corrections should be incorporated in the global fitting of the pdf s using the same factorization scheme which has been employed to calculate the cross section .",
    "current fits to the pdf s do not include qed corrections , which introduces a small uncertainty into the calculation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : one]a we display the ratio of the @xmath29 and the born cross section as a function of the @xmath30 invariant mass in @xmath31 at tevatron energies . in the region",
    "@xmath32  gev , the cross section ratio is seen to vary rapidly .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the iba incorporates the running electromagnetic coupling constant , the @xmath2 propagator expressed in terms of the fermi constant , @xmath33 , and the @xmath2 boson mass and width measured at lep , and the vector and axial vector couplings expressed in terms of the effective leptonic weak mixing angle . the ratio shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : three]a directly displays the effect of the weak box diagrams and the energy dependence of the weak coupling form factors .",
    "while the additional weak contributions change the differential cross section by 0.6% at most , they do modify the shape of the @xmath2 resonance curve .    figure  [ fig : three]b compares the effect of the @xmath29 qed corrections and the full @xmath29 electroweak corrections on the di - muon invariant mass distribution at the lhc for @xmath34 values between 200  gev and 2  tev . due to the presence of logarithms of the form @xmath35 , the weak corrections become significantly larger than the qed corrections at large values of @xmath34 , and ,",
    "eventually , may have to be resummed  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath36  tev , the full @xmath37 electroweak corrections are found to reduce the differential cross section by more than 20% .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath3 corrections to @xmath1 boson production  @xcite employs the same monte carlo method which was used in the @xmath2 case .",
    "the collinear singularities originating from initial state photon radiation are again removed by counter terms generated by renormalizing the pdf s .",
    "calculating the ew radiative corrections to @xmath1 boson production , the problem arises how an unstable charged gauge boson can be treated consistently in the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "this problem has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with particular emphasis on finding a gauge invariant decomposition of the ew @xmath3 corrections into a qed - like and a modified weak part . in @xmath1 production",
    ", the feynman diagrams which involve a virtual photon do not represent a gauge invariant subset . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated how gauge invariant contributions that contain the infrared ( ir ) singular terms can be extracted from the virtual photonic corrections .",
    "these contributions can be combined with the also ir - singular real photon corrections in the soft photon region to form ir - finite gauge invariant qed - like contributions corresponding to initial state , final state and interference corrections .",
    "the ir finite remainder of the virtual photonic corrections and the pure weak one - loop corrections can be combined to separately gauge invariant modified weak contributions to the @xmath1 boson production and decay processes .",
    "since hadron collider detectors can not directly detect the neutrinos produced in the leptonic @xmath1 boson decays , @xmath38 , and can not measure the longitudinal component of the recoil momentum , there is insufficient information to reconstruct the invariant mass of the @xmath1 boson .",
    "instead , the transverse mass ( @xmath39 ) distribution of the @xmath40 system , or the @xmath41 distribution of the charged lepton , are used to extract @xmath8 . the @xmath39 distribution for electron and muon final states at the born level and including @xmath3 corrections at the tevatron is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : four]a .",
    "the various individual contributions to the ew @xmath3 corrections of the @xmath39 distribution in the electron case are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : four]b .",
    "= 2.9 in    to model the detector acceptance , the following @xmath41 and @xmath42 cuts were imposed in fig .",
    "[ fig : four ] : @xmath43 @xmath44 these cuts are similar to the acceptance cuts used by the dcollaboration in their @xmath1 mass analyses in run  i. as before , uncertainties in the energy and momentum measurements of the charged leptons in the detector are simulated in the calculation by gaussian smearing of the particle four - momentum vector .",
    "the initial state qed - like contribution uniformly increases the cross section by about 1% .",
    "it is largely canceled by the modified weak initial state contribution .",
    "the interference contribution is very small .",
    "it decreases the cross section by about @xmath45 for transverse masses below @xmath8 , and by up to @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "the final state qed - like contribution significantly changes the shape of the transverse mass distribution and reaches its maximum effect in the region of the jacobian peak , @xmath48 . as for the initial state ,",
    "the modified weak final state contribution reduces the cross section by about @xmath49 , and has no effect on the shape of the transverse mass distribution .",
    "since the final state qed - like contribution is proportional to @xmath50 , its size for muons is considerably smaller than for electrons .",
    "the initial state corrections and the interference contribution are very similar for electron and muon final states .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : four ] , we have not taken into account the recombination of electrons and photons if their opening angle is small . as in @xmath2 boson production , when recombination is included , the mass singular logarithmic terms are eliminated .",
    "this significantly reduces the size of the ew corrections .",
    "figure  [ fig : five ] demonstrates the effect for the transverse momentum distribution of the electron in @xmath51 at the lhc .",
    "= 2.5 in    the solid histogram shows the cross section ratio taking only the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lepcut ] ) and  ( [ eq : ptmisscut ] ) into account .",
    "the dashed histogram displays the result obtained when in addition the four momentum vectors are smeared according to the atlas specifications  @xcite , and electron and photon momenta are combined if @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained for tevatron energies and cdf and d  lepton identification criteria .",
    "as we have seen , final state bremsstrahlung has a non - negligible effect on the shape of the @xmath39 distribution in the jacobian peak region . as in the @xmath2 boson case , final state photon radiation shifts the @xmath1 boson mass extracted from data to a lower value . in the approximate treatment of the electroweak corrections",
    "used so far by the tevatron experiments , only final state qed corrections are taken into account ; initial state , interference , and weak correction terms are ignored .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the final state soft and virtual photonic corrections is estimated from the inclusive @xmath15 @xmath16 width and the hard photon bremsstrahlung contribution  @xcite .",
    "when detector effects are included , the approximate calculation leads to a shift of about @xmath53  mev in the electron case , and approximately @xmath54  mev in the muon case  @xcite .",
    "since only one of the @xmath1 decay products radiates photons , the shift in @xmath8 is about a factor  2 smaller than the shift in @xmath12 caused by photon radiation .",
    "initial state and interference contributions do not change the shape of the @xmath39 distribution significantly ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : four]b ) and therefore have little effect on the extracted mass . however , correctly incorporating the final state virtual and soft photonic corrections results in a non - negligible modification of the shape of the transverse mass distribution for @xmath47 . for @xmath1 production at the tevatron",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] , which shows the ratio of the @xmath39 distribution obtained with the qed - like final state correction part of our calculation to the one obtained using the approximation of ref .  @xcite .",
    "= 3.in    the difference in the line shape of the @xmath39 distribution between the @xmath29 calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite and the approximation used so far occurs in a region which is important for both the determination of the @xmath1 mass , and the direct measurement of the @xmath1 width .",
    "the precision which can be achieved in a measurement of @xmath8 using the transverse mass distribution strongly depends on how steeply the @xmath39 distribution falls in the region @xmath48 .",
    "any change in the theoretical prediction of the line shape thus directly influences the @xmath1 mass measurement . from a maximum likelihood analysis the shift in the measured @xmath1 mass due to the correct treatment of the final state virtual and soft photonic corrections is found to be @xmath55 . for the precision expected in run  ii and for the lhc such a shift can not be ignored .",
    "two photon radiation has only a modest effect on the shape of the @xmath39 distribution  @xcite .",
    "detailed simulations will be necessary to determine its effect on the @xmath1 mass .",
    "the calculation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite was carried out in the pole approximation , ie .",
    "the form factors associated with the modified weak corrections were evaluated at @xmath56 .",
    "this approximation is valid in the vicinity of the @xmath1 pole .",
    "away from the resonance region it will be important to go beyond the pole approximation .",
    "calculations which do so are in progress  @xcite .",
    "preliminary results  @xcite indicate that the radiative corrections for @xmath57  gev in a full calculation are up to a factor  2 larger than those calculated in the pole approximation",
    ". this may be important for a measurement of the @xmath1 width from the high transverse mass tail .",
    "accurate theoretical predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 boson production are essential for many important electroweak precision measurements in future hadron collider experiments , in particular the measurement of the @xmath1 mass and width .",
    "in addition , comparison of the @xmath2 boson mass and width with the values obtained at lep will help to calibrate detectors .",
    "all these measurements require a detailed understanding of the ew radiative corrections .",
    "i have described the current status of calculations of the @xmath3 ew corrections to @xmath1 and @xmath2 boson production in hadronic collisions .",
    "these calculations will be complete by the time run  ii of the tevatron is expected to start .",
    "much more work is required to determine the effect of multiple photon radiation on the weak boson masses extracted from hadron collider experiments .",
