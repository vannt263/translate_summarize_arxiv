    "adiabatic transport describes the nondissipating response of systems driven by time dependence @xcite .",
    "an attractive feature of this theory is the geometrization of linear response theory .",
    "its central result is the identification of transport coefficients with components of the adiabatic curvature .",
    "because the theory describes reactive  rather than dissipative  transport , intuition that comes from dissipative ( ohmic ) transport is of no real value .",
    "for example , it allows for charge transport in materials that are nominally insulators @xcite .",
    "the classical counterpart of the theory was studied in @xcite",
    ".    the focus of our study will be the role of points of gap closures .",
    "this is where one expects interesting things to happen .",
    "this is also where one can expect to find universal behavior which is , to a large extent , system independent .",
    "the basic questions we shall ask is : what distinguishes a cycle that pinches a gap closure from a cycle that does not ?    the answer to this question turns out to be related to a question asked by longuet - higgins @xcite : can one tell if a cycle of hamiltonians traps a point of level crossing ?",
    "the answer to longuet - higgins question is provided by looking at what is now known as berry s phase @xcite . in the special case of hamiltonians invariant under time reversal ,",
    "the phase is @xmath1 and is known as the longuet - higgins phase .",
    "a longuet - higgins phase of @xmath2 is associated with conic ( aka generic ) level crossing , and no crossing has phase @xmath3 .",
    "the longuet - higgins phase has observable implications to the vibrational and rotational spectra of molecules @xcite .",
    "what we add to this is that this phase also has observable implication for electronic transport .",
    "when the cycle of deformation does not trap a gap closure ( so longuet - higgins phase is @xmath3 ) , the charge transport is proportional to the _ area _ of the cycle .",
    "the response to weak driving is small .",
    "in contrast , a cycle that traps a generic level crossing , with longuet - higgins phase @xmath2 , is characterized by homeopathic response , where the charge transport in a molecular ring is _ inversely _ proportional to the length of the cycle . in particular",
    ", a vanishing cause leads to a diverging response . in the case of infinite chains",
    "the behavior is somewhat different and in some ways more intriguing .",
    "it is still true that there is a weak response for a tiny cause when the cycle does not trap a gap closure .",
    "but , for a cycle that traps a gap closure , the charge transport is _ integral _ , independent of the strength of the driving .",
    "charge pumps are quantum systems where quantized charge transport is driven by a periodic modulation @xcite , and have been recently realized @xcite .",
    "the thouless - niu pumps are non - homeopathic : once the driving becomes weak the charge transport drops discontinuously to zero .    charge transport driven by deformations",
    "may be thought of as a generalized version of piezoelectricity .",
    "piezoelectricity was put in a geometric framework in @xcite . in this case , one replaces the global question  what is the charge transport by a full cycle of deformation  by the local question : what is the ratio of current to the rate of deformation .",
    "diverging piezoelectricity in hubbard models of perovskites near gap closures was found in numerical studies in @xcite .",
    "as we shall explain , near a generic crossing the ratio of current to rate of deformation is inversely proportional to the distance from the crossing in an infinite chain and inversely proportional to the square of the distance in a molecular ring .",
    "the divergence of transport near gap closures has a geometric interpretation .",
    "it is an analog of an elementary fact about the curvature of surfaces such as spheres and tori .",
    "the average ( gaussian ) curvature @xmath4 of a surface with @xmath5 handles , whose area is @xmath6 is , by gauss - bonnet , @xmath7 the homeopathic behavior of transport is basically the divergence of the ( average ) curvature as the area , @xmath6 , shrinks to zero .",
    "@xmath8 is a measure of the distance from the point of level crossing . in molecular rings",
    "the ratio of current to rate of deformation is analogous to the gaussian curvature and diverges like @xmath9 .",
    "the charge transport in a cycle pinching a gap closure behaves like a line integral of the curvature and is of the order of @xmath10 .    in the case of infinite chains with infinitely many electrons",
    "there is an extra integration over the occupied states in the brillouin zone . as a consequence",
    ", the ratio of current to rate of deformation behaves like a line integral of the curvature and diverges like @xmath10 .",
    "the charge transport in a cycle of deformation is then like an area integral of the curvature . for a @xmath5 handle surface this gives @xmath11 , independent of its area .",
    "the corresponding statement for charge transport is that a cycle of deformations transports an integer charge independent of the size of the deformations ( provided it encircles the point of gap closure ) .",
    "a model for a charge pump that transports integral charge for infinitesimal cycles is the insulating infinite helix described in section [ hcp ] .",
    "quantum charge transport driven by deformation has a classical analog in the theory of elasticity .",
    "@xmath12 , the group of uniform shears and rotations of @xmath13 , is generated by @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 generate shears , and @xmath17 generates rotations . since @xmath18=2g_0,\\ ] ] the commutators of infinitesimal shears generate rigid rotation .",
    "taking an elastic body through a _ small _ cycle of shears results in an overall rigid rotation .",
    "this is , perhaps , the most elementary mechanical analog which mimics the ability of cats to land on their feet by rotating while in free fall @xcite .",
    "using shears to rotate is inefficient : a cycle of deformation of size @xmath8 gives a rotation by an angle of order @xmath6 .",
    "the charge transported in such a cycle is also of order @xmath6 if the cycle does not pinch gap closure .",
    "if it does , the charge is of order @xmath10 .",
    "there appears to be no classical analog of this .",
    "a hallmark of the kind of adiabatic response discussed here is that a molecular quantum system can act as an ac to dc converter .",
    "for example , if one drives a cyclic deformation of the molecule by , say , circularly polarized radiation , the response will be a dc current that would give rise to a dc magnetic field .",
    "it was established @xcite that nuclei , in his case @xmath19he , can also respond with a dc magnetic field to polarized radiation ; in this case this was achieved by biasing the population of up and down spins .",
    "the piezoelectric response of molecular rings leads to the same effect by a very different mechanism .",
    "in this section we derive the basic identity of adiabatic transport which relates the transport coefficients with the components of the adiabatic curvature . this identity is not new @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this section is to present it as a consequence of an apparently new operator identity .",

    "@xmath49 that survives in the @xmath50 limit , and a _ linear response _ which is proportional to the rate of deformation @xmath51 .",
