    "their x - ray spectral and variability properties ( with significant changes on time scales as short as 1 day ) indicate they contain accreting black holes .",
    "our multiwavelength observations of these two ulxs and the other less luminous persistent and transient x - ray sources in ngc  1313 will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the third ulx in ngc  1313 is the unusual luminous supernova .",
    "this was the second supernova to be detected and recognized as a supernova from its radio emission and the first from its x - rays @xcite .",
    "there was no x - ray detection by _ einstein _ in 1980 ; the first x - ray detection was by _ rosat _ , 13 years after the explosion .",
    "it is rare that supernovae are bright enough to be followed in the x - ray band @xcite , and sn  1978k is one of only a few that have had long - term monitoring .",
    "there was no evidence for radio emission prior to the supernova . unlike a `` normal '' type ii supernova ,",
    "the peak radio luminosity was very high .",
    "sn  1978k is thus one of the most important members of the `` type iin '' sub - class of supernovae @xcite .",

    "following on from the previous radio observations @xcite , the atca has continued to make occasional observations of sn  1978k .",
    "the data acquisition followed the same procedures as outlined in @xcite .",
    "the dataset for each observation and frequency was edited and calibrated using the miriad software package . rather than estimating the unresolved flux density of sn  1978k from plots of the calibrated visibility amplitude as in @xcite , the uvfit task was used instead in the visibility domain to fit a point source at the known location of sn  1978k .",
    "figure [ atcafigure ] and table [ radiotable ] add 7 data points at all four frequencies ( 8640 , 4790 , 2496 , and 1376 mhz ) to the results presented by @xcite .",

    "figure [ atcafigure ] shows that while the evolution has generally continued to follow the model curves , there have been significant deviations from a smooth decay .",
    "in particular , there was a major dip at higher frequencies in april 2002 .",
    "the most recent observation suggests a return to the long term rate of decline at each frequency .",
    "the most recent radio observations of sn  1978k show that it continues to be easily detectable more than a quarter of a century after the explosion , but with increasing deviations from a smooth decline .",
    "the first tentative vlbi detection of a resolved remnant @xmath25  mas in size would correspond to a diameter of 0.2  pc , which allows us to place an upper limit on the average expansion velocity of @xmath26 .",
    "the significant departures from a smooth decline likely reflect changes in the circumstellar medium density .",
    "this indicates that a major change occurred in the mass - loss rate of the progenitor star prior to the supernova event .",
    "the time that this change took place depends on the assumed stellar wind velocity , and thus the progenitor type . for a wolf - rayet / lbv progenitor with a stellar wind @xmath27 ,",
    "the change in mass - loss rate must have occurred @xmath28 years before the explosion . for a red supergiant wind speed of @xmath29",

    ", we observed approximately every three months ( the first observation was redone due to a slew failure ) to monitor the longer - term variability .",
    "all the cycle 2 and 3 observations were centered on ulx x-2 .",
    "an advantage of using _ xmm - newton _ to observe ngc  1313 is that ulx x-1 , x-2 , and sn  1978k are all well within the field of view in a single pointing .",
    "however , depending on the satellite orientation , in some of the observations sn  1978k was located on or very close to a bad column in one of the detectors , or on or near a boundary between mos or pn ccds : in these cases , little or no useful data was collected by one or more of the detectors .    the _ xmm - newton _",
    "observation on 2003 - 12 - 09 was fully simultaneous with a portion of the atca observation . unfortunately ,",

    "observation on 2004 - 11 - 23 was fully simultaneous with a portion of the atca observation .",
    "the whole of this _ xmm - newton _ observation was unaffected by flares . however ,",
    "a dark column ran through sn  1978k in the pn data , and thus only the mos1 and mos2 data are useful for that day .    in table [ xraytable ] we list all our _ xmm - newton _ observations from cycles 2 and 3 .",

    "while some of these spectra have short exposure times due to the flaring , leaving out the poorest spectra does not make any significant difference to the fitting results .",
    "all the 2003 - 2005 observations were made in full frame epic mode , and used the thin optical blocking filter .",
    "although the sources in ngc  1313 are bright , pile - up was not a problem for any of them .",
    "the total count rate limits for the detectors were not reached thanks to the low diffuse emission from the galaxy .",
    "all the 2000 - 2005 data were reduced using version 6.5 of the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas ) .",
    "a couple of test cases were re - reduced using the newer version 7.0 of sas , but this did not result in any significant changes .",
    "the spectral and timing analysis was performed using heasoft version 6.1 .",
    "the data reduction followed the standard steps in sas .",
    "for all the data , the pipeline processing was redone using emchain and epchain .",
    "the times were determined when soft proton flaring was significant  when the full - image count rate for photons @xmath34 was above 0.35  cps for the mos and above 1  cps for the pn  and these data segments were removed .",
    "images were made for each detector , and it was examined whether sn  1978k was significantly affected by bad columns on the ccd or by the boundary between ccds .",
    "there were no out of time problems for the source .",
    "spectra and light curves were made for sn  1978k using the 0 - 12 x - ray patterns for the mos and the 0 - 4 patterns for the pn .",
    "a @xmath35 extraction radius around the source was used .",
    "the data were screened for defects with # xmmea_em ( mos ) or # xmmea_ep ( pn ) , and events next to the ccd edges were excluded using flag=0 .",
    "background spectra and light curves were made in the same fashion using a nearby region on the same ccd that was free of defects .",
    "since the telescope orientation was not the same for each observation , the location of the background region changed with time ; however , this was not a significant problem since the background flux was always much lower than that of the source .",
    "photon redistribution matrices ( rmf ) and ancillary region files ( arf ) were generated for the location of sn  1978k for use in the spectral analysis .",
    "the calibration of the epic instruments was good enough that no fixed or floating normalization factors were needed to match the fluxes for the three detectors ; the improved cross - calibration of the detectors in sas 6.5 fixed the problems in our initial analysis @xcite .",
    "after our original manuscript was submitted , an additional _ xmm - newton _ observation of ngc 1313 taken on 2006 - 03 - 06 became publicly available ( pi : stefan immler ) .",

    "folding the 2006 data into the joint 2000 - 2005 fit leads to very small changes in the `` best fit '' values cited in  [ xmodel ] ; the optimized values are all well within the original errors for the parameters . rather than re - writing all of  [ xmodel ]",
    ", we have left that section as a discussion of the modeling of the 2000 - 2005 data .",
    "we have added ",
    "[ x2006 ] to discuss the fitting of the 2006 data , which acts as an independent test of the model .",
    "the x - ray emission from sn  1978k has been fit using an absorbed two - temperature optically thin hot thermal plasma model ( dual vmekal in xspec ) to model the forward and reverse shocks formed by the interaction of the supernova ejecta with its surroundings @xcite .",
    "modeling the _ xmm - newton _",
    "spectra for each of the separate days , we find that acceptable statistical fits can be obtained using a range of model parameters . since fluctuations in the x - ray light curve with amplitudes @xmath36% might be seen",
    "if the ejecta are significantly inhomogeneous ( or more based on the radio variability ) , we do not necessarily expect to get the same fit results for each day .",
    "it is also plausible that the x - ray light curve might be decaying as a power law as the remnant expands @xcite , or it might brighten steadily if the supernova ejecta runs into a denser circumstellar envelope .",
    "there could also be other systematic variations  such as the temperatures cooling  in one or more of the parameters .",
    "however , since several of our observations span a relatively short range of time compared to the time since the explosion , significant changes in the model parameters may be less likely .",
    "historically , the recent x - ray monitoring of sn  1978k has found it consistent with being constant @xcite .    to address the variability issue in a concrete way",
    ", we have combined all the _ xmm - newton _ data from 2000 to 2005 and investigated whether there is a model that can simultaneously fit all this data .",
    "this assumes that there is no systematic evolution or significant short - term variability for any of the fit parameters .",
    "if we were unable to find a good fit to the joint data , this would imply that one or more of the parameters was changing significantly .",
    "on the other hand , finding a good fit to the joint data does not necessarily guarantee that this is the correct result ; the spectra from a variable source might by chance average out ( although the increase in the number of photons in the joint fit makes this difficult to accomplish ) .",
    "ultimately , as we illustrate in  [ x2006 ] , the joint fit can be fully tested by using it to fit future observations , allowing for plausible slow long - term evolutions .",
    "our modeling of the combined data found that it was not possible to get a good fit using solar abundances for the hot plasmas .",
    "assuming solar abundances for all the components , the best fit gives a reduced chi squared of @xmath37 for @xmath38 degrees of freedom and an unacceptably low null hypothesis probability of @xmath39 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ xmmsolarfigure ] .",
    "although the temperatures of the vmekal components are similar to previous results @xcite , the value of @xmath40 in this case is rather low .",
    "we investigated varying the abundances of the vmekal model components .",
    "we systematically tried allowing individual elements to vary without constraint ( with the absorption , temperatures , and normalizations also unconstrained ) .",
    "we also tried allowing combinations of elements to vary without constraint .",
    "surprisingly , we found that acceptable fits could only be attained in one special circumstance : the helium abundances in both the plasmas need to be large .",
    "this would imply that the x - ray emitting shocks are currently located in a helium - rich layer that was ejected by the progenitor star , or helium - rich material was ejected in the supernova explosion .",
    "a representative fit is shown in figure [ xmmfitfigure ] .",
    "the parameters for this fit are given in table [ jointmodel ] .",
    "with the exception of the helium abundances , the fit parameters are similar to those found previously by @xcite .",
    "the fit has @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the ratio of the model to the data does not have systematic variations , unlike the case when using solar abundances .",
    "fixing all the parameters of the large helium abundance model to the values given in table [ jointmodel ] , we compared the model to the data for each day separately to see if every day could be explained by the same model .",
    "only one day gave an unacceptable result ; 2004 - 05 - 01 had @xmath44 .",
    "however , only mos data was available for that day . for 2004 - 05 - 01 , leaving all the parameters fixed at the values in table [ jointmodel ] but allowing just the helium abundances to vary gave a good fit ( @xmath45 ) with helium abundances of 7.5 for the hard component and 23.5 for the soft ; these values are consistent with the original error bars for these parameters .",
    "the following observation on 2004 - 06 - 05  that had more data  was well explained by the original fixed model ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "thus if there was any deviation in the abundances , it was short - lived .",
    "the next worst day 2003 - 12 - 21 had @xmath47 , which is a fine fit .",
    "thus the individual day results are consistent with the assumption that there was no systematic evolution or large - scale variability .    for sn  1978k , the absorption found in our best joint fit is @xmath48 .",
    "this is much higher than the value typically found for the rest of ngc  1313 plus the milky way ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "thus this must be dominated by absorbing material close to sn  1978k .",
    "the value of @xmath50 found in our joint fit is tightly constrained and agrees very well with the value of @xmath51 that was found from the mean column density measured around sn  1978k @xcite .",
    "this adds further credence to our joint fit results and the large helium abundance model .",
    "the implication of our model is that the absorption is currently dominated by the material ejected by the supernova progenitor and/or its natal molecular cloud .",
    "@xcite had a range of @xmath50 in their different fits and suggested that @xmath50 may be increasing with time .",
    "we instead conclude that @xmath50 is consistent with remaining constant over the recent observations .",
    "@xcite also suggested that an excess of silicon improved the fit .",
    "however , this only affects a couple of spectral bins and we do not find any significant improvements in the fit when the silicon abundances are varied .",
    "we have studied varying the metallicity of the absorbing material for sn  1978k , but find no significant deviations from solar abundances .",
    "the fact that the absorption is currently dominated by material close to the source means that the metallicity of the interstellar medium in ngc  1313 is not an important issue when fitting the sn  1978k x - ray spectra , unlike the case for the accreting ulxs .",
    "a low metallicity absorption is indicated when fitting the _ xmm - newton _",
    "data for the two accreting ulxs @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with other studies that have shown that the metallicity in ngc  1313 is a factor of 4 lower than in the milky way and that this is the highest mass barred spiral without a radial abundance gradient @xcite .",
    "allowing for a low abundance of oxygen is particularly important when modeling the low temperature soft component in ulxs which has been interpreted as being disk blackbody emission from an optically thick disk around a @xmath52 black hole .",
    "the unabsorbed fluxes from sn  1978k in the @xmath53 and @xmath54 bands are @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "these fluxes are similar to those in @xcite . assuming a distance of 4.13 mpc @xcite , the corresponding luminosities are @xmath57 ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath58 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the luminosity for the whole @xmath59 band is @xmath60 .",
    "the long clean 2006 - 03 - 06 _ xmm - newton _ observation of sn 1978k was used as an independent test of the results found in  [ xmodel ] .    as was found when fitting the 2000 - 2005 data",
    ", the 2006 - 03 - 06 data can not be fit using a dual vmekal model with solar abundances for the hot plasmas .",

    "the 2006 - 03 - 06 observation is well fit by the large helium abundance model described in  [ xmodel ] that fit the 2000 - 2005 data . using the parameters from table [ jointmodel ]  with no additional optimization  the fit has @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "folding the 2006 data into the joint 2000 - 2005 fit leads to very small changes in the `` best fit '' values for the large helium abundance model given in table [ jointmodel ] .",
    "the new values are all well within the original errors for the parameters .",
    "these results bolster the conclusions that ( 1 ) there has been no significant evolution of the x - ray parameters recently , and ( 2 ) the large helium abundance model gives a good explanation for the 2000 - 2006 data .",
    "in models for long - duration grbs , it is thought that the progenitor star at least ejects its hydrogen envelope prior to the supernova / hypernova ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if this did not take place , the relativistic jet would not escape with sufficient energy to make a long grb .",
    "however , only a tiny fraction of massive stars produce a grb when they die , perhaps @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "this leads to the question of what features of the progenitor are necessary / sufficient to produce a grb .",
    "although grbs are believed to be associated with type ib or ic supernovae , given the rare and unusual nature of the type iin sn  1978k and the fact that it had significant ejections prior to the explosion , we have searched for any grbs that might have been associated with this supernova .    based on the optical observations summarized in  [ intro ] , the supernova explosion took place some time between 1977 october 12 and 1978 july 31 .",
    "these dates bracket our search for an associated grb .",
    "the interplanetary network ( ipn ) of grb satellites has existed since 1976 .",

    "thus the localization of the bursts was poor during the sn  1978k window .",
    "@xcite used the data from the available satellites to determine the grbs that were detected by at least two instruments on separate satellites .",

    "based on the locations of these bursts @xcite , 5 of them are clearly not consistent with the location of sn  1978k .",
    "however , grb  771029 is close to sn  1978k ; the supernova is inside the @xmath1 error box of grb  771029 .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainty in the location for this burst is large , and the probability that sn  1978k would lie in the @xmath68 error annulus is 14% .",

    "thus if grb  771029 was associated with sn  1978k , this would have been an exceptionally underluminous burst .",
    "however , we do not know what luminosity should be expected for a grb associated with a type iin supernova .",
    "an argument against the association of grb  771029 and sn  1978k is that the radio and optical emissions likely peaked in 1978 may , which would be many months after the burst .",
    "the existence of lags between the grb and supernova events is not currently supported by observations .",
    "for example , in the grb  060218/sn  2006aj association @xcite , the supernova and grb were coeval to within @xmath75 day .",
    "the rare type iin supernova sn  1978k remains bright in radio and x - rays @xmath0 years after the explosion .",
    "the @xmath59 luminosity is @xmath60 .",
    "the radio imaging shows that the source remains compact , but it may be marginally resolved , @xmath25  mas in size corresponding to a diameter of 0.2  pc .",
    "the recent radio observations show deviations from a smooth decay suggesting that inhomogeneities are present in the radio emitting region .",
    "it appears that a major change occurred in the mass - loss rate of the progenitor star ",
    "possibly a lbv  shortly before the supernova event .    the winds from the progenitor star produced a dense medium .",
    "the x - ray emission is consistent with coming from two shocks in this medium .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations from 2000 to 2006 can all be fit using the same model , with no systematic evolution or short - term variability . while the model parameters that we find are similar to those in previous studies , the new element of our modeling",
    "is the large abundance of helium .",
    "this suggests that the shocks are located in a helium - rich layer that was ejected by the progenitor star , or helium - rich material was ejected in the supernova explosion .    using the large helium abundance model , the value of @xmath50 is tightly constrained and agrees very well with the value found from the mean column density measured around sn  1978k",
    "this indicates that the absorption is currently dominated by the material ejected by the progenitor and/or its natal molecular cloud .",
    "the value of @xmath50 is consistent with remaining constant over the recent observations .",
    "the unusual properties of the supernova motivated a search for an associated grb .",
    "considering just the confirmed grbs , only one grb is consistent with the location of sn  1978k ; the supernova is inside the @xmath1 error box of grb  771029 .",
    "however , this is likely just a chance alignment .",
    "it is of particular interest to continue to study the long - term multiwavelength evolution of this rare supernova to study the mass - loss history of the progenitor star . by continuing to watch how sn  1978k evolves ,",
    "it will be possible to understand whether the unusually dense circumstellar medium is the result of an extreme mass - loss rate , a low wind velocity , or the presence of cavities and clumps .",
    "is the mass loss at late epochs episodic ( resulting in an onion - like shell structure ) ?",
    "is it bipolar , with rings and hotspots as in sn  1987a ? is there evidence that a grb took place , even if the burst was not beamed towards earth ? ultimately , is it the environment or intrinsic factors that dictates which stars end their lives as type iin supernovae ? while it is expected that there will be a slow evolution ( @xmath76  years ) of the plasma temperatures , normalizations , and/or abundances , the variability of the radio indicates that changes on shorter time scales should continue to be investigated .",
