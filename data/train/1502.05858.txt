    "ophiuchus is considered to be the nearest site of clustered star formation @xcite .",
    "star formation in ophiuchus is heavily influenced by the nearby sco ob2 association @xcite , the centre of which is at a distance of @xmath1pc from ophiuchus @xcite . the southwest / northeast - aligned filamentary streamers from each of the central regions are thought to be due to the effects of this association @xcite .",
    "the l1688 cloud shows a much more active star formation history than the neighbouring l1689 cloud to the east , supporting this scenario ( @xcite  hereafter nwa06 ) .",
    "ophiuchus is a part of the gould belt , a ring of molecular clouds and ob associations @xmath2kpc in diameter and inclined @xmath3 to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the gould belt is considered a ` laboratory ' for the study of low - mass star formation , as most of the low - mass star forming regions within 500pc of the earth are associated with it .",
    "this has led to surveys aimed at mapping substantial fractions of the gould belt being undertaken using the jcmt @xcite , the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite , and the _ spitzer _ space telecope @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report on the scuba-2 first results for ophiuchus from the jcmt gould belt survey ( gbs ) and compare them to harp co j=3@xmath42 observations from the jcmt gbs , as well as to data from other gould belt surveys .",
    "we study the starless core population of ophiuchus , in particular investigating the stability of the cores against gravitational collapse in order to identify the prestellar ( i.e. gravitationally bound ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) subset of the population of starless cores .",
    "there have been many previous wide - field millimetre and submillimetre studies of the starless core population in the l1688 cloud ( e.g. @xcite  hereafter man98 ; @xcite ;",

    "the iterations were halted when the map pixels , on average , changed by @xmath50.1% of the estimated map rms .",
    "the initial reductions of each individual scan were coadded to form a mosaic from which a mask based on signal - to - noise ratio was produced for each region .",
    "the final mosaic was produced from a second reduction using this mask to define areas of emission .",
    "detection of emission structure and calibration accuracy are robust within the masked regions , and are uncertain outside of the masked region .",
    "the mask used in the reduction can be seen in figure a5 in appendix a.    a spatial filter of 10  is used in the reduction , which means that flux recovery is robust for sources with a gaussian fwhm less than 2.5 .",
    "sources between 2.5  and 7.5  in size will be detected , but both the flux and the size are underestimated because fourier components with scales greater than 5  are removed by the filtering process .",
    "detection of sources larger than 7.5  is dependent on the mask used for reduction .",
    "the mask introduces further spatial filtering , as after all but the final iteration of the map - maker , all emission outside the region enclosed by the mask is suppressed .",

    "co contamination was corrected for by re - reducing each of the 850-  observations with the integrated @xmath12co data added to the scuba-2 bolometer time series as a negative signal .",
    "the contribution of co emission to the total observed flux density in l1688 was found to be 4.6% .",
    "the fractional co contamination varies significantly across l1688 . in the dense centres of oph a , b , c and f",
    "the co contamination fraction is typically @xmath21% , while in oph e , located along the same line of sight as the edge of the outflow from vla 1623 , the contamination reaches up to 10% .",

    "the contamination fraction reaches @xmath22 .",
    "harp co data are only available for the central l1688 region ; other regions can not be corrected for in the same manner .",
    "however , it is only in l1688 that there is likely to be substantial contamination , and as even in l1688 the mean contribution of the co emission is less than 5% , dropping to @xmath23 in the dense , 850 - -bright regions in which the majority of our sources lie , it is unlikely that measured 850-  flux densities outside of this region are significantly affected .    as a caveat ,",
    "we note that a co outflow can be seen in the 850-  data of l1689 , to the east of the northernmost part of the region .",
    "this outflow , marked in magenta on figure  [ fig:850data ] , was previously identified as submillimetre condensation smm21 by nwa06 , and is likely to be the outflow known to be associated with the protostar(s ) iras 16293 - 2422 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that there is likely to be some co contamination associated with iras 16293 - 2422 in the l1689 north region .",

    "scuba-2 is not sensitive to spatial scales greater than 600 . in order to make scuba-2 and _",
    "herschel _ observations comparable , the large - scale structure must be removed from the _ herschel _ observations . to accomplish this ,",
    "the scuba-2 pipeline was applied to the _ herschel _ observations following the method described by @xcite , in which the _ herschel _ data are added to the scuba-2 bolometer time series , and the reduction process , as described in section  [ sec : s2dr ] , is repeated , including the application of the mask shown in figure a5 to the _ herschel _ data .",
    "the original scuba-2 reduction of the data is then subtracted from the _ _ herschel__+scuba-2 map , leaving the spatially - filtered _ herschel _ signal .",
    "the aim of this procedure is to treat the _",
    "herschel _ data as if it were scuba-2 data . in order to achieve this , it is necessary to minimise the effect of the _ herschel _ data on the mapmaking process by treating it as a small perturbation to the scuba-2 signal ( the input _ herschel _ data is scaled appropriately ) . in this way , differences in areas of significant emission , noise levels and beam size between the scuba-2 and _ herschel _ maps do not distort the final , filtered , map , or prevent the mapmaking process from converging .",
    "this spatial filtering removes the need to use planck data to determine global background levels for the _ herschel _ data sets ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as all large - scale structure is removed from the filtered maps , leaving no background signal in emission - free regions .",
    "the filtering process was repeated once for each scuba-2 observing position for which there was corresponding _ herschel _ data , and the resulting spatially - filtered maps were combined to form a mosaic .",
    "the only region in the scuba-2 mosaic of ophiuchus not covered by _",

    "scuba-2 450-  flux densities have previously been seen to show an excess over the values predicted from interpolation of the _ herschel _",
    "350-  and 500-  bands @xcite . this discrepancy was also seen in our data when they were brought to a common resolution using the published beam models .",
    "the hypothesis that the apparent 450-  excess was caused by the approximation of the scuba-2 450-  beam secondary component as a gaussian @xcite led to the construction of a set of convolution kernels from the _ herschel _ and scuba-2 beam maps following the method of @xcite , which we summarise here .",
    "this method works from beam maps rather than published beam models , and involves constructing a convolution kernel @xmath24 that maps point spread function ( psf ) @xmath25 onto the lower - resolution psf @xmath26 : @xmath27 in principle , @xmath24 is derived using @xmath28 where ft represents the fourier transform operator and ft@xmath29 the inverse fourier transform . however , in practice the division by @xmath30psf@xmath31 leads to @xmath24 being dominated by noise , unless the high spatial frequency ( i.e. high wavenumber @xmath32 ) components of psf @xmath25 are filtered .",
    "firstly , high - frequency noise is filtered from both psfs using a filter @xmath33 which takes the form @xmath34 & { \\rm for\\ } k_{\\alpha}<k\\le k_{\\beta } \\\\    0 & { \\rm for\\ } k_{\\beta}<k \\end{cases } \\label{eq : phi}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36fwhm where fwhm is the fwhm of the instrument primary beam .",
    "hereafter , ft@xmath37 ft .",
    "the highest - frequency components of psf @xmath25 are further filtered : equation  [ eq : kernel1 ] becomes @xmath38 and the filter @xmath39 takes the form @xmath40 & { \\rm for\\ } k_{\\textsc{l , a}}<k\\le k_{\\textsc{h , a } } \\\\    0 & { \\rm for\\ } k_{\\textsc{h , a}}<k \\end{cases }",

    "the scuba-2 and spire beams are already approximately circular and are largely unchanged by this circular averaging .",
    "the pacs beam , which is substantially elliptical , is more affected , and the convolution process may produce some slight distortion in the convolved 160-  map .",
    "however , as both the circular averaging process and the convolution process conserve flux , and as the pacs 160-  beam ( 12@xmath1416 ) is smaller than the spire 250-  beam ( 18 ) along both its major and minor axes , the total flux measured inside each aperture at 160  will be accurate .",
    "it should also be noted that all of the scuba-2 , spire and pacs instruments scan in more than one direction on the sky while taking an observation , and hence the beam pattern is rotated several times within each observation .",
    "this means that the beam pattern is to some extent circularly averaged even before the convolution is applied .",
    "figure [ fig:450to250 ] shows the result of convolving the maps with these kernels to the lowest - resolution wavelength band being considered ( _ herschel _ 250- ) ; this caused a marked reduction in the discrepancy between the 450-  flux density and the _ herschel _ flux densities .",
    "this then allowed the 450-  data to be used in spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting , as discussed below .",
    "source extraction was performed on the co - subtracted scuba-2 850-  map of l1688 , and the non - co - subtracted scuba-2 850-  map of the remainder of the field .",
    "sources were identified using the curvature - based cutex algorithm @xcite in its detection mode .",
    "cutex identifies sources through signal in the second derivatives of the input map , effectively removing background and large - scale structure from the map , and leaving the sharp changes in gradient associated with compact sources .",
    "cutex was chosen after extensive testing of various different methods as the algorithm best able to break apart the emission in crowded regions of the map ( oph a and oph b ) , and which was in the most agreement with previous studies .    [",

    "* and references therein ) : @xmath46 where the subscript ` 0 ' indicates the reference ( measured ) value of each quantity .",
    "we note that this relation implies a constant ratio between turbulent and magnetic energy .",
    "the magnetic energy can be expressed as @xmath47 while the nonthermal component of the kinetic energy , @xmath48 , is given by @xmath49 ( see equation  [ eq : kinetic_energy ] ) .",

    "the horizontal dashed line on figure  [ fig : energy_balance ] marks the division between those cores that are gravitationally bound ( above the line ) and those that are pressure - confined ( below the line ) .",
    "there is a wide variation from region to region , with oph a being the most gravitationally bound and oph c being the most highly pressure - confined .",
    "these differences are discussed further in section  [ sec : regional ] . it should be noted that a full virial analysis has only been performed on those cores located in regions targeted for  observations , i.e. the regions of highest column density .",
    "the results of this analysis can not necessarily be generalised to the cores for which  data are not available .",
    "the bonnor - ebert ( be ) model of a starless core @xcite is frequently used as a measure of the stability of starless cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ".,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    we investigated whether the critical be stability criterion ( @xmath69 ) can accurately predict the virial balance of starless cores in l1688 , and hence whether it can be reliably used as a proxy for virial mass in regions for which line data are not available .",

    "critically stable be masses for the remainder of the set of cores for which  data are are available are listed in table  [ tab : line ] , but are excluded from figure  [ fig : be_plot ] in order to aid comparison with figure  [ fig : energy_balance ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : be_plot ] shows that there is no correlation between observed mass and critical be mass , indicating that , as would be expected for a set of virially unstable cores , our cores can not be modelled as static , critically - stable , be spheres .",
    "moreover , the critical be stability criterion does not reliably predict the either virially bound state or the energy balance of the  cores .",
    "a core lying to the right of the line of unity on figure  [ fig : be_plot ] has no stable be solution and must , according to be analysis , be collapsing under its own gravity , while a core lying to the left of the line of unity may be modelled as a stable , pressure - confined be sphere .",
    "we find that the be criterion typically over - predicts the degree to which our cores are gravitationally unstable .",
    "of the 15 cores predicted to be collapsing under gravity according to figure  [ fig : be_plot ] , 9 are in fact found to pressure - confined",
    ". however , there are no cases where the be analysis suggests a core is pressure - confined and it is found to in fact be gravitationally bound . the degree to which cores are virially bound is in many cases also overestimated .",
    "for example , the be criterion predicts that all 6 of the cores in oph b2 will be strongly gravitationally bound , whereas figure  [ fig : energy_balance ] shows that of these 6 cores , 4 are approximately virialised , and the other 2 , while virially bound , are confined by external pressure .",
    "a possible explanation for these discrepancies is that in this analysis we have used the standard be mass formula ( equation  [ eq : be ] ) , which does not account for the contribution of non - thermal motion to internal support .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : therm_nontherm ] , our cores typically have transonic or mildly supersonic internal motions at the radii traced by , and hence assuming all support against collapse is thermal is likely to overestimate the degree to which our cores are both gravitationally unstable and virially bound .",
    "an accurate parameterisation of the effect of non - thermal internal motion on core support might improve the accuracy of the be analysis .",
    "another important consideration is that while in principle the 8 cores lying to the left of the line of unity in figure  [ fig : be_plot ] can be modelled as stable , pressure - confined be spheres , figure  [ fig : energy_balance ] shows that many of our cores , whether confined by pressure or by gravity , are not in virial equilibrium .",
    "caution must be exercised when applying an equilibrium model such as a be sphere to a non - equilibrium set of objects such as the cores in this sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : energy_balance ] shows that most of the cores in our sample for which  data are available are either bound or virialised .",
    "figure  [ fig : m / r_plot ] shows that our cores occupy the part of the mass / size plane in which prestellar cores are expected to lie . however , whether our cores are gravitationally bound ( i.e. prestellar ) or pressure - confined varies from region to region .",
    "gravity strongly dominates over external pressure in the most massive cores in oph a , the well - known prestellar cores sm1 , sm1n and sm2 .",
    "cores in oph a@xmath70 and b are typically in approximate equipartition between gravitational and pressure energy or marginally pressure - dominated .",
    "however , cores in oph c and e are strongly pressure - dominated and virially bound .",
    "it is noticeable from all of the above that the properties of the starless cores , including the degree to which cores are bound , as well as whether they are gravitationally bound or pressure - confined , and the extent to which turbulence is dissipated , varies more between regions than within them .",
    "this suggests that the local environment has a significant effect on the nature of the starless cores .",

    "this suggests a morphology in the region in which the dense gas that makes up the central , submillimetre - bright cores of oph a is being influenced by its local environment .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig : therm_nontherm ] , cores in b2 have the highest non - thermal linewidths measured in , suggesting that turbulence is not being effectively dissipated in this region .",
    "we hypothesise that this could be due to the influence of the outflow from irs 47 , as protostellar outflows have been shown to inject and sustain turbulence on small scales in molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "we note that the pre - brown dwarf candidate oph b-11 @xcite , located between oph b1 and b2 , is detected in scuba-2 850-  emission .",
    "oph b-11 is discussed in detail in appendix  d.          oph c appears to be extremely quiescent , and substantially less evolved than the rest of the oph c - e - f ` filament ' of which it appears to be a part .",
    "the three cores we identify within oph c are all substantially bound and pressure - confined , with broad  linewidths , as shown in figure  [ fig : therm_nontherm ] .",
    "the  linewidths , however , indicate that the cores in oph c are among the least supersonic in .",
    "the reason for this apparently very effective dissipation of turbulence is not clear , although the lack of embedded sources driving outflows might be a possibility .",
    "the lack of embedded sources in oph c , along with its considerably lower aspect ratio than its neighbours oph e and oph f , lead us to suggest that oph c may have a slightly different line - of - sight distance than other regions , possibly being further from influences such as hd 147889 . there are no embedded protostars in oph c listed by @xcite .",
    "we consider oph e and oph f together , due to the low number of cores detected in these regions , along with the similarities between the two regions .",
    "these appear to be the most evolved regions of l1688 , with a high ratio of embedded sources to starless cores : oph e has four embedded class i sources , while oph f has six .",
    "cores in oph f are at a similar temperature to those in oph a and a@xmath63 , although without any obvious external heating .",
    "the core in oph f for which an energy balance can be determined appears to be gravitationally bound , while the core in oph e is pressure - confined .",
    "linewidths show substantial turbulence , similarly to oph c , while these cores are the least supersonic in .",
    "again , we hypothesise that this effective dissipation of turbulence may be the result of a lack of outflows in either of these regions .",
    "the starless cores we find in l1689 and l1709 are typically of similar mass to those in oph b , c and e. we find six starless cores in l1689s ; four in l1689 ; and one in l1709 .",
    "@xcite list four embedded class i protostars in l1689s ; one class 0 source in l1689n ; and two class i sources in l1709 .",
    "the low number of cores relative to l1688 , the low ratio of embedded sources to starless cores , and the presence of the class 0 source iras 16293 - 2422 suggests that l1689 and l1709 are likely to be less evolved than , or forming stars less efficiently than , l1688 .",
    "this was explained by nwa06 as due to l1689 being further from the sco ob2 association than l1688 , and hence less active .",
    "it is clear from the discussion above that the different regions of the l1688 cloud do not show the same properties or evolutionary stage , despite being in close proximity both to one another and to hd 147889 .",
    "there is a marked variation in temperature across the cloud , with oph a and a@xmath63 being the warmest regions , followed by oph f , e , c , b1 , and b2 , in that order .",
    "oph a and a@xmath63 are clearly being influenced by the nearby b stars . as discussed in section  [ sec : external_pressure ] , the flux of ionising photons from the two b stars is not a dominant term in the virial equation in oph a. however , these stars will be heating the gas and dust within oph a.    figure  [ fig : rgb3 ] shows in blue the warm dust traced by _ spitzer _",
    "8-  emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which surrounds oph a and a@xmath63 on two sides . it should be noted that while the relative influence of hd 147889 on l1688 as a whole must be much greater than that of s1 , the flux of ionising photons from s1 on oph a is approximately twice that of hd 147889 ; the s1 reflection nebula is likely to have at least as much influence on oph a as the pdr driven by hd 147889 , even though the former is much smaller .",
    "oph a and oph b appear to be at similar evolutionary stages , despite their marked difference in temperature . both regions have embedded sources driving outflows , which may be hindering the dissipation of turbulence within the region . however , while oph a shows the influence of local effects , oph b appears to be evolving in a more quiescent location :",
    "it is the coldest of the regions , and figure  [ fig : rgb3 ] shows no sign of it being bordered by pdrs or reflection nebulae .",
    "cores in oph a and oph b are typically of similar mass ( see figure  [ fig : mass_comparison ] ) .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : energy_balance ] , while some of the cores in oph a are strongly gravitationally dominated , the cores in oph b are close to equipartition between gravitational potential energy and pressure .",
    "it is possible that material in oph a might have been swept up by the pdr and the reflection nebula , increasing local density and hence leading to the strongly gravitationally bound prestellar cores in this region .",
    "oph e and f appear to be at a later evolutionary stage than oph a and b , with a high ratio of protostars to starless cores , several embedded sources , and no embedded sources young enough to be driving outflows .",
    "those starless cores that are found are among the least massive in l1688 ( see figure  [ fig : mass_comparison ] ) .",
    "these regions are both at an intermediate temperature .",
    "there is no obvious source of external heating , similarly to oph b , suggesting that the embedded sources in oph e and f might be heating their surroundings . what might have led these regions to begin forming stars earlier than oph a and b is not clear .",
    "oph c is noticeably different from the other regions in l1688 , being an apparently entirely quiescent region , with only a few low - mass , pressure - confined cores and no embedded sources . as discussed above , this leads us to suggest that oph c might be at a slightly different line - of - sight distance than the neighbouring regions .",
    "there appears to be a general gradient in evolutionary stage from southwest to northeast across the cloud ( except for oph c ) .",
    "this could be due to the influence of the sco ob2 association , located behind and to the southwest of ophiuchus @xcite ; hd 147889 , also behind ophiuchus @xcite , appears to be primarily of importance in oph a , and to have relatively limited influence elsewhere .    while a global southwest / northeast gradient in evolutionary stage can be inferred , and is consistent with previous studies ( @xcite ; nwa06 ) , it must be emphasised that the properties of regions within l1688 appear to be determined substantially by local effects . in particular , the differences in temperature and energy balance between cores in oph a and oph b , two regions apparently at similar evolutionary stages , but with different immediate local environments ( oph a being heavily influenced by two b stars , and oph b evolving in a less disturbed location ) , indicate the importance of local effects in determining the properties of starless cores .",
    "in this paper , we have extracted a set of sources from the scuba-2 850-  map of the ophiuchus molecular cloud , and have characterised the properties of these cores using scuba-2 , _ herschel _ , iram and harp data sets .",
    "we identified sources using the cutex curvature - based soure extraction algorithm , which gave us a catalogue of 93 sources , 70 of which were in the central region of the l1688 sub - cloud .",
    "of these 93 sources , 46 were identified as protostellar , and 47 were identified as starless cores . of the 70 sources in l1688 , 47 were uniquely identified with a source in the s08 catalogue .",
    "we determined the dust temperature of each source by sed fitting , which allowed an accurate mass determination to be made for each source .",
    "the distribution of masses of the starless cores is consistent with the expected shape of the core mass function .",
    "the low counting statistics of our sample did not allow us to accurately determine the power - law index of our core mass function , although the two slope values determined , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are both consistent with the expected behaviour of the high - mass initial mass function .",
    "we calculated the masses of our cores from  and  emission .",
    "we found that the mass of a core determined from 850-  continuum emission and the mass determined from  emission correlate well , indicating that  and continuum emission are tracing the same material .",
    "the most massive cores , those in oph a , have consistently higher continuum masses than  masses , indicating that as expected ,  emission does not trace the very densest material in prestellar cores .",
    "we performed full virial stability analyses for the 23 cores for which both  and  data were available , estimating the contributions of gravitational energy , internal pressure ( both thermal and non - thermal ) and external pressure to the energy balance of the cores .",
    "existing measurements of the magnetic field strength in ophiuchus suggest that magnetic energy is unlikely to significantly alter the energy balance of our cores .",
    "we found that most of our cores are bound or virialised , with a virial ratio @xmath73 .",
    "we calculated the bonnor - ebert critically stable masses for each of the 23 cores for which  data are available .",
    "we found that our cores can not be modelled as critically stable bonnor - ebert spheres , and that the bonnor - ebert critically stable mass is not a good estimator of the bound state of the cores for which we can perform a full virial analysis , typically overestimating the degree to which cores are gravitationally bound .",
    "we found that whether our cores are gravitationally bound or pressure confined depends strongly on the region in which they are located .",
    "cores in the centre of oph a are gravitationally bound , while cores in oph c and e are pressure - confined .",
    "cores in oph a@xmath63 , b and f are in approximate equipartition between gravitational potential energy and external pressure energy , with pressure typically slightly dominating .",
    "we see a loss of turbulence between core linewidths measured in  and core linewidths measured in .",
    "this supports a picture in which dissipation of turbulence occurs in the dense centres of starless cores . at the radii traced by  emission",
    ", turbulence is dissipating , but is not yet fully dissipated , with a transonic or mildly supersonic non - thermal component to the core linewidth still present even when the core is on the brink of gravitational collapse . the degree to which which turbulence is dissipated varies between regions , with turbulence",
    "being dissipated more within oph c , e and f than within oph a , a@xmath63 and b.    these results show that starless cores in the ophiuchus molecular cloud are non - equilibrium objects with complex relationships with their local environments , and that a detailed analysis of their energy balance , of the sort we have carried out here , is required in order to accurately determine their virial state .",
    "in particular , we have shown that external pressure is of key importance to the energy balance of most of the densest starless cores in ophiuchus , and thus can not be neglected in a virial analysis .",
    "the wealth of continuum and kinematic data now available for many galactic star - forming regions now allows for detailed analyses of the virial balance of starless cores in other regions to be performed , and a thorough understanding of their behaviour and relationship with their environments to be developed . in future papers we will carry out such studies in other gould belt star - forming regions",
