    "the increased interest in the dynamics of domain walls in magnetic nanostructures is rooted mostly in perspective applications in novel spintronic devices .",
    "several recent experiments demonstrated that the motion of domain walls can be effectively controlled by means of an external magnetic field or an electric current .",
    "@xcite    the theory of domain wall motion has been worked out long time ago.@xcite within this theory , the magnetic dynamics is usually described in the framework of a classical ferromagnet assuming separation of the magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom . in this way three- or two - dimensional ferromagnets are treated .",
    "present studies of the domain wall dynamics are devoted to the issue of the current - induced magnetic motion in nanowires and nanoconstrictions . in the presence of an electric current",
    ", the domain wall can move due to a spin torque exerted on the magnetic system by the spin - polarized electron gas .",
    "in addition , ( linear ) momentum can be transferred directly to the domain wall upon scattering of the charge carriers .",
    "the problem of calculating the spin torque is of a prime importance for the theory of the domain - wall motion , however only few recent works address this point specifically.@xcite    the domain - wall motion can be described by landau - lifshitz equations , which have a well - known static solution for the domain wall .",
    "finding the corresponding dynamical solution is however a nontrivial task , particularly in the presence of an external force .",
    "the standard way is to describe the domain wall dynamics using an approximate scheme , which is based on physically reasonable arguments , but a strict mathematical justification is missing .",
    "the simplest approach is to use an approximate solution that assumes the moving wall to have exactly the same shape as deduced from the static solution .",
    "the rigorous conditions for the range of validity of this approximation are however unclear .",
    "to obtain reliable results numerical simulations are needed .",
    "@xcite    most recently , new approaches have been put forward which address @xcite the calculation of the torque as well as the solution of the dynamical equations of motion of the domain wall .",
    "some aspects of these works are developed further and partially revised in this paper .",
    "our treatment is concentrated on the spin torque and on the wall dynamics in a magnetic nanowire with a domain wall which is sharp on the length scale set by the wave length of the relevant charge carriers .",
    "the approach is thus more appropriate for the case of magnetic semiconductors with a small fermi momentum of carriers ( electrons or holes).@xcite",
    "here we consider the spin torque transferred by the electric current from the spin polarized electron system to the domain wall .",
    "the main goal of our calculation is the demonstration of the presence of two components of the torque , which tend to rotate the magnetic moment in different directions .",
    "we adopt a one - dimensional model for the charge carriers with a point - like interaction between the electron spin @xmath0 and the magnetic moment @xmath1 located at a point @xmath2 along the wire @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the coupling constant . here the one - dimensionality of the electronic system means that we consider the electrons within a wire with transversal dimensions smaller than the electron wavelength @xmath5 , so that only the lowest electron subband is relevant . strictly speaking",
    ", the coupling of the moment to the electron spin depends on the coordinates @xmath6 that characterize the location of the moment within the wire , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the wave function of the transverse motion of electrons in the lowest subband . for simplicity , in the following we neglect this dependence , substituting it by an averaged coupling , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the cross section of the wire .",
    "considering the scattering of electrons from a magnetic moment @xmath1 we assume that the moment is frozen in the point @xmath2 on the scale of the characteristic times of the electron motion .",
    "this assumption renders possible calculation of the torque as in the case of a static domain wall .",
    "the calculated torque is then utilized for the investigation of the domain wall dynamics .",
    "our assumption relies on an adiabatic approximation insofar as we require the time scale for the motion of the magnetic subsystem to be slow as compared to that of the electrons .    to calculate the torque in the case of a sharp domain wall , we start from a model describing the one - dimensional scattering from a localized moment in nonmagnetic and magnetic wires .",
    "then we use the results obtained for the simplified models , to calculate the torque acting locally on the moments within the domain wall .",
    "let us consider first scattering of electrons in a nonmagnetic one - dimensional system ( nonmagnetic nanowire ) .",
    "the electrons are scattered from a single frozen magnetic moment @xmath11 situated at the point @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 . here",
    "we denote the coordinate along the wire as @xmath2 . in the absence of the spin - orbit interaction , it is more convenient to use a different coordinate system @xmath14 for the spin space .",
    "we calculate the total scattering amplitude ( beyond the born approximation ) of an electron with an arbitrary spin polarization , coming from @xmath15 , and elastically scattered into the states with different spin polarizations .    assuming the quantization axis @xmath16 along the moment @xmath17 , we can write the spinor wave function of electrons as @xmath18 where the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to an arbitrary spin polarization in the incident electron wave , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are , respectively , the reflection and the transmission coefficients in the spin up channel @xmath23 @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the magnitude of the localized magnetic moment .    using eqs .",

    "it rotates the moment @xmath11 to the direction perpendicular to vector @xmath59 ( and also to @xmath60 ) .",
    "thus , the spin torque acting on a single magnetic moment can be found as a change of the spin current due to scattering from the localized moment .",
    "the same result is obtained from the calculation of the interaction of accumulated spin with the localized moment . in the following , to calculate the torque in the domain wall , we will use both methods but the second one ( coupling to the accumulated spin ) is more convenient in case of a sharp domain wall .",
    "we assume that in the case of a smooth domain wall , it can be more convenient to solve the problem considering it as a propagation of a spin - polarized wave with subsequent scattering from different magnetic moments .",
