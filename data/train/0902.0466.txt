    "studying the spectra of x - ray binaries is one of the main tools for understanding the physics of these source and determine the properties of the acccretion disk and the compact object that they host . from an observational standpoint , galatic black hole candidates ( bhcs )",
    "show a number of spectral states , defined in terms of the components in their x - ray spectra and the flux level ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the so called _ high state _ ( @xcite ) , the spectrum is dominated by a soft , thermal component up to 1 - 2 kev , with a power - law emerging at higher energies . in the _ low state _ ( @xcite ) the soft component is not present and the spectrum is well fitted by a power - law with a cut - off at few tens of kev .",
    "transitions to an _ intermediate state _ ( @xcite ) or a _ very high state _ ( @xcite ) are also observed in which both components are present and equally important in terms of the emitted flux .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this classification is based also on the timing properties of the sources ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is largely accepted that the soft , thermal component originates from an accretion disk , while the power - law is likely produced by comptonization of the soft disk photons from a hotter phase of the accretion flow ( usually referred to as corona ) . in these assumptions , in principle the properties of the disk and the physical parameters of the accreting black hole ( bh ) can be inferred from the study of the soft component .",
    "similar spectral states ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and correlated spectral / flux variability ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) are also observed in ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , very bright , point - like x - ray sources in the field of nearby galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , several pieces of evidence indicate that the majority of ulxs are x - ray binaries , chiefly among them the detection of periodic modulations in the x - ray flux ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and the identification of stellar optical counterparts ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra of several ulxs show a soft , thermal component , similar to that observed in bhcs , which has been interpreted as emission from an accretion disk , although for some ulxs with spectral curvature above 2 - 3 kev different spectral models have also been proposed ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to model the soft component in bhcs and ulxs the so called multicolor disk blackbody model ( mcd ; @xcite ) has been often adopted because it is easy to use and is efficiently implementated in the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec .",
    "the fitting parameters of the mcd model ( the disk inner temperature and the normalization of the spectrum ) depend on the bh mass and accretion rate , and can in principle be used to estimate the physical parameters of the accretion flow and of the bh .",
    "however , it is well known that this model represents an approximation of the standard , shakura & syunyaev ( 1973 ) disk and differs from it for the expression of the temperature profile , in which the effects of the viscous torque at the inner boundary are neglected .",
    "also , the locally emitted spectrum is assumed to be a blackbody , neglecting the vertical temperature structure and atmospheric radiative transfer effects .",
    "although the effects of a zero - torque inner boundary in a pseudo - newtonian potential ( @xcite ) were implemented in the _ diskpn _ model ( @xcite ) , temperature profile correction factors for the mcd model were also derived ( e.g. @xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", limited deviations from lte caused by radiative transfer effects were accounted for using an hardening factor @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the color and effective temperatures ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "even adopting all these correction factors , deviations of the mcd with respect to a standard disk spectrum may be significant if the physical state of the disk changes or the coupling bewteen the disk and the corona becomes important , which may occur especially at high accretion rates ( @xcite ) .",
    "despite all these uncertainties , the parameters of the mcd fit have been used for estimating the mass of the bh and the accretion rate in x - ray binary systems .",
    "this has recently been done also for ulxs for which , at present , x - ray spectroscopy provides one of the few available methods to obtain zero - th order estimates of the bh mass .",
    "indeed , if the soft component observed in ulx spectra is fitted with a mcd model ( e.g. @xcite ) , its characteristic temperature is typically @xmath4 ev , much lower than that observed in galactic bhcs . both the low temperature and high normalization constant of the mcd model have been used to estimate the bh masses , typically obtaining values largely in excess of 100 @xmath5 . modelling",
    "the soft component in these terms is clearly possible if ulxs are in an accretion stage similar to that of bhcs in the soft ( or nearly soft ) state , so that a disk spectral component is present . along with the very high ( isotropic ) luminosity of these sources , these `` spectroscopic estimates '' have led to the suggestion that they may contain intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) .    in this paper",
    "we revisit and compare standard models of accretion disks around black holes that include the appropriate zero - torque inner boundary condition and/or relativistic effects on the emission and propagation of radiation .",
    "they are derived in the usual assumptions that : ( 1 ) the accretion disk is optically thick , geometrically thin and in a quasi - steady state ; ( 2 ) the locally emitted spectrum from a small annulus of the disk is a blackbody ( @xmath6 ) , with a color correction factor @xmath7 taking into account for atmospheric transfer effects .",
    "the comparison is performed adopting the mcd as reference model and looking for the parameter space in which it turns out to be in agreement with `` more physical '' accretion disk models .",
    "the fits are performed keeping either the bh mass or the accretion rate fixed and allowing the inner radius of the mcd to vary .",
    "this gives us simple recipes that can be used for adjusting the estimates of the physical inner radius of the disk , the black hole mass and the accretion rate inferred using the parameters of the mcd fits .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a short summary of the basic structure equations of the accretion disk models considered in this work ; section 3 presents the results of the comparison among the different spectral models ; section 4 is devoted to an application of the results of this comparison to some representative ulx spectra , while section 5 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "in this section we summarize the basic equations of the accretion disk models that we have considered in our work .",
    "we start with recalling the main properties of the standard disk model @xcite and the multicolor disk blackbody model ( mcd , @xcite ) , that are usually adopted in fitting the spectra of x - ray binaries .",
    "then , we shortly review the structure equations for a relativistic accretion disk orbiting around a schwarzschild and a kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "the emergent spectrum is calculated taking into account the relativistic effects on the emission and propagation of light ( gravitational redshift , light bending , doppler shift ) using the formalism of the transfer function introduced by @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated treatments of photon propagation in curved space - times , both numerical @xcite and also analytical @xcite are available .",
    "such techniques adopt ray tracing of the photon geodetics from the disk plane to the observer and are particularly suited when dealing with the calculation of spectral line profiles .",
    "however , we are essentially interested in comparing the continuum spectral shape of the mcd disk with that of a standard and relativistic disk and , to this end , a treatment of the relativistic geometrical optics a l @xcite appears acceptable .",
    "let s consider the _ standard accretion disk _",
    "model @xcite in the usual approximations ( newtonian , optically thick , geometrically thin and in a quasi - steady state ) .",
    "the expression of the temperature profile is obtained setting the energy rate of viscous dissipation equal to the total radiation flux ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath8^{1/4},\\\\ \\label{a0}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 @xmath10 is the black hole mass , @xmath11 is the accretion rate and @xmath12 is the inner disk radius .",
    "the emitted spectrum is calculated assuming that the disk emits locally as a blackbody , so that : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the disk s inclination angle with respect to the direction of the line of sight , @xmath15 is the distance to the observer , @xmath16 is the outer disk radius and @xmath17 is the specific intensity .",
    "we assume that the gas is in lte and hence @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the planck function .",
    "the mcd model is an approximation of the standard disk and differs from it only for the expression of the temperature profile , in which the effects of the viscous torque at the inner boundary are neglected .",
    "the temperature profile is then given by @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the inner radius of the mcd .",
    "the emitted spectrum can again be calculated from equation  ( [ a1 ] ) , with the temperature profile given by equation  ( [ a2 ] ) .    in the following",
    ", we will use the mcd model as reference for fitting the standard and relativistic disk spectra , because this model is frequently adopted for the spectral fits of x - ray binaries .",
    "the fitting parameters of the mcd model , the disk inner temperature @xmath23 and the spectral normalization factor @xmath24 , depend on @xmath10 and @xmath25 .",
    "assuming that the inner radius @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the gravitational radius ) , it is possible to write @xmath10 and @xmath25 as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 $ ] .    in these assumptions ,",
    "if the distance @xmath15 is known and the inclination angle @xmath14 is fixed , the mcd parameters can be used for estimating @xmath10 and/or @xmath25 .",
    "these expressions depend on the value of @xmath30 , the inner radius in units of @xmath31 , and @xmath23 .",
    "it is well known that these estimates of the bh mass and the disk accretion rate are uncertain , because the physical state of the disk may vary and , in addition , radiative transfer effects induced by scattering may cause departures of @xmath32 from @xmath33 . several non - lte accretion disk models , in which radiative transfer effects at the surface of the disk are computed , have been presented in the literature , for both hot disks around stellar mass bhs ( e.g. @xcite ) and cool disks around intermediate mass bhs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these effects are very important in predicting the local spectra emitted at a given disk annulus and can be accounted for using an hardening factor @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the color and effective temperature .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath34 and , as a consequence , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , as a first approximation , we account for radiative transfer effects simply inserting @xmath37 into equations ( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "computations of @xmath7 for standard and relativistic disks give values in the interval 1.4 - 2 ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the structure equations and the emitted spectrum of the relativistic disk are obtained in the same assumptions stated above : ( 1 ) the accretion disk is optically thick , geometrically thin and in a quasi - steady state ; ( 2 ) the local emitted spectrum from a small annulus of the disk is a blackbody ( @xmath6 ) .    in the following , we will refer to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit around a black hole with @xmath38 .",
    "its expression is given by : @xmath39^{1/2}\\right\\},\\\\ \\label{a5}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are functions of @xmath10 and @xmath42 @xcite , and @xmath42 is the specific angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "a detailed derivation of the structure of a relativistic accretion disk around a black hole is presented in @xcite and @xcite to which we refer for all the details . here",
    "we present only the relevant equations for the temperature profile and the locally emitted flux .",
    "following @xcite , the emitted radiation flux can be expressed as a function of the integrated @xmath43 component of the stress - energy tensor ( evaluated in the comoving frame of the observer in geodetic circular motion ) as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 depend on the radial coordinate @xmath48 and the specific angular momentum of the black hole @xmath42 ( @xcite ) . the function",
    "@xmath47 depends also on the angular momentum per unit mass of a generic circular orbit and of the innermost stable circular orbit ( @xcite ) . assuming that the radiative transport of energy is dominant over the turbolent one , in lte we can write @xmath49 comparing equations ( [ a12 ] ) and ( [ a13 ] ) it is possible to obtain the surface temperature profile for a relativistic accretion disk : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is given by equation  ( [ a01 ] ) .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite the spectrum of a relativistic accretion disk is calculated by means of a trunsfer function @xmath7 , that accounts for all relativistic effects on the emission and propagation of radiation ( doppler shift , light bending and gravitational redshift ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath7 is @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the radius of a generic emitting ring of the disk , @xmath54 is the polar angle between the line of sight of the distant observer and the disk s polar axis , @xmath55 is the solid angle that a specific geodesics family subtends to the observer at a given energy and for a given emission radius , @xmath56 is the ratio of the observed photon energy and the emitted one , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are functions of @xmath60 ( for their expression see @xcite ) .",
    "the radiation flux seen by a distant observer is : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the observed specific intensity .",
    "if @xmath63 is the emitted specific intensity , from the expression of the relativistic invariant @xmath64 and equation  ( [ a16 ] ) we obtain the observed luminosity per unit energy @xmath65 using equation  ( [ a15 ] ) it is possible to rewrite @xmath66 in terms of @xmath67 . inserting the resulting expression into equation ( [ a19 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath68 tabulated values of the transfer function for a schwarzschild and a maximally rotating ( @xmath69 ) kerr bh were reported by @xcite . in the following",
    "we will consider these two extreme cases as reference .",

    "we implemented the structure equations and spectra of the accretion disk models outlined above and produced fits of the standard and relativistic disks against the mcd model .",
    "this model - model comparison has been performed by means of a standard @xmath76 minimization procedure , that provides also an assessment of the statistical significance of the fit .",
    "a fixed reference error of @xmath7710% was assigned to the spectra .",
    "as mentioned above , we use the mcd model as reference for fitting all the other disk spectra , because this model is frequently adopted for the spectral fits of x - ray binaries within xspec .",
    "the values of the best - fitting mcd parameters are then compared with those of the other models .",
    "from now on we refer to the different accretion disk models with the following expressions : _ disk - stand _ for the standard accretion disk @xcite , _ disk - bb _ for the mcd @xcite , _ disk - rel _ or _ disk - kerr _ for a relativistic disk around a schwarzschild or a maximally rotating ( @xmath78 ) kerr black hole @xcite , respectively .",
    "we will also use different indeces to denote the mass @xmath10 and the accretion rate @xmath11 of the different models ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 for the _ disk - bb _ ; @xmath81 , @xmath82 for the _ disk - stand _ ; @xmath83 , @xmath84 for the _ disk - rel _ ; @xmath85 , @xmath86 for the _ disk - kerr _ ) .",
    "the accretion rate is expressed in units of the eddington accretion rate @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "for an accretion efficiency @xmath89 , the accretion luminosity reaches @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "fits of the standard disk with a mcd were performed in the literature in order to obtain correction factors for the inner disk radius , the black hole mass and the accretion rate ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we performed similar fits of the _ disk - stand _ with the _ disk - bb _ but keeping either the bh mass or the accretion rate fixed .",
    "acceptable fits with different best - fit values of @xmath22 were obtained ( see table  @xmath92 ) . for the fit with fixed @xmath10 , we obtain @xmath93 , while for the fit with fixed @xmath11 , @xmath94 . in the first case ,",
    "the value of @xmath80 returned by the fit is @xmath95 smaller than @xmath82 while , in the second case , the values of @xmath79 derived from the fit is @xmath96 smaller than the corresponding value of @xmath81 . clearly , there are also fits with fixed @xmath22 in the interval 13@xmath9714.9 , that return intermediate values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( see again table  @xmath92 ) . in figure",
    "@xmath98 we show the results of one of these fits .",
    "these results are in agreement with those of @xcite , who showed that the inner radius of the best - fitting mcd model does not correspond to the true inner radius of the standard disk , but that the two radii are related by the expression ( see also @xcite ) @xmath99 in fact , in order for the spectral peaks of the _ disk - bb _ and _ disk - stand _ be superimposed ( see figure @xmath98 ) , the maximum temperature of the standard disk ( 0.488@xmath100 ; see equations  [ [ a0 ] ] and [ [ a01 ] ] ) must be equal to the maximum temperature of the _ disk - bb _",
    "( @xmath23 ; see equation  [ [ a02 ] ] ) . from this , equation  ( [ a21 ] ) easily follows .",
    "therefore , assuming that the _ disk - stand _ terminates at the isco ( innermost stable circular orbit ) , @xmath101 and the inner radius of the best - fitting _ disk - bb _ must be located at @xmath102 , in subtantial agreement with the results of the model - model fits .",
    "we note that all the results presented here hold for any inclination angle , as the _ disk - bb _ and _ disk - stand _ models have the same dependence on @xmath14 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "a certain number of ulxs show two component x - ray spectra that can be adequately modelled with a soft thermal component plus a power - law .",
    "if the soft component is fitted with a mcd , the fitting parameters ( in particular the normalization @xmath103 ) return very large values for the bh mass , often in excess of several hundreds @xmath5",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these masses are calculated from equation  ( [ a3 ] ) assuming specific values for the inner radius @xmath30 ( in units of @xmath31 ) and the color correction factor @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite adopted @xmath104 and @xmath105 .    in the previous section , we performed fits of the standard and relativistic disk with a mcd keeping the bh mass fixed and determined the ( range of ) values of @xmath30 for which the spectra are in statistical agreement .",
    "these values are reported in tables [ tab0 ] , [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] and differ from what assumed by @xcite and @xcite . for the standard disk , there appears to be more agreement with what reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we are then in the position to revise previous estimates of the bh mass ( and accretion rate ) of ulxs based on mcd spectral fits of the soft component , adopting the appropriate value of @xmath30 for both a standard and a relativistic disk .    for illustrative purposes",
    ", we use the results of the mcd spectral fits of ngc 1313 x-1 , ngc 1313 x-2 , m 81 x-9 and ngc 4559 x-7 obtained by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . from equations  ( @xmath106 ) and  ( @xmath107 ) of section  [ standard accretion disk and mcd ] , we calculate the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 for different values of @xmath30 and assuming @xmath105 , and report them in tables  [ tab3 ] and  [ tab4 ] .",
    "the values that correspond to @xmath104 are those reported by @xcite and @xcite , whereas the values for @xmath108 correspond to those expected for a standard disk around a maximally rotating kerr , newtonian , or schwarzschild bh , respectively . as can be seen from the tables , the values of the mass are systematically lower ( up to a factor 3 ) than those of a mcd with @xmath22 at the isco ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "this is clearly a consequence of the larger fitting radius required by the newtonian and relativistic disks . comparing the masses of the different `` physical '' models ,",
    "it is possible to see that the largest value is obtained for a disk around a maximally rotating kerr bh ( _ disk - kerr _ ; see tables  [ tab3 ] and  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the ( boyer - lindquist ) radial coordinate of the isco for a maximally rotating , kerr bh is @xmath110 that of a schwarzschild bh of the same mass ( cmp .",
    "@xcite ) . indeed , for a fixed value of @xmath22 ( in cm ) as returned by the mcd fit of an observed spectrum , a lower value of @xmath30 necessarily implies a larger mass as @xmath111 .",
    "we need to fill the same physical radius @xmath22 with a bigger bh in order to reduce the value of @xmath30 . ultimately , the smaller value of @xmath30 returned by the fit of the _ disk - kerr _ model is a consequence of the fact that the kerr spectrum is significantly harder than those of the other `` physical '' disk models computed with the same value of the parameters ( see figure  [ figure4 ] ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , apart from ngc 4559 x-7 , the bh masses for a schwarzschild disk are no longer significantly in excess of @xmath112 , with a distribution clustering in the interval 100 - 200 @xmath5 ( see again tables  [ tab3 ] and  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "this is true also for m 81 x-9 , for which the second observation returns somewhat larger values of the mass .",
    "however , as the limits inferred from the two observations of this source must be consistent within the errors , the mass of the bh must be in the interval @xmath113 ( smaller / larger values would not be consistent with the second / first observation ; see the last row in table  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "all the mass estimates obtained for the _ disk - rel _ model are then significantly lower than those reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the only exception is ngc 4559 x-7 for which , however , there are hints of timing features in the power density spectrum and it has been proposed that it may contain a bh of several hundreds solar masses ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred bh masses can reach the values estimated by @xcite only for a disk around a maximally rotating , kerr bh .",
    "the spectrum of a standard disk can be well reproduced by a mcd model . however , as already noted by @xcite , if one tries to exploit the mcd model to derive the values of the accretion rate and black hole mass , with the usual assumption that , in the soft state , the disk terminates at the isco ( @xmath114 ) , the inferred values of @xmath10 and @xmath25 are largely overestimated . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectrum of the standard disk can be fitted by a mcd model with the same values of @xmath10 or @xmath25 if we take @xmath26 with @xmath115 or @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "this is in substantial agreement with the approximate value ( @xmath117 ) that can be derived using analytic arguments .",
    "also in the case of a relativistic disk around a schwarzschild black hole , for sufficiently small inclination angles the emitted spectrum can be well reproduced by a mcd model ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) . for small angles , in fact ,",
    "one can try to guess the disk and black hole parameters using the best - fitting mcd model but , as for the standard disk , a suitable assumption must be made on the inner disk radius .",
    "we found that there exist precise values of @xmath22 ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) for which the values of @xmath10 and @xmath25 inferred from the mcd are the same as those provided by the relativistic disk .",
    "for large angles , owing to genuine relativistic effects , no satisfactory mcd spectral fit of the relativitisc disk spectrum can be obtained ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum of an accretion disk around a fast rotating kerr black hole , is in general more strongly affected by relativistic effects compared with those of a disk around a schwarzschild blak hole . as a consequence",
    ", it can be well reproduced by a mcd model , only in the case in which the disk is essentially face - on . in this assumption , there exist values of @xmath22 for which the mcd and kerr disks return similar values of @xmath10 and @xmath25 ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively ) .",
    "also in this case , for large inclination angles , the spectrum of the _ disk - kerr _ model becomes intrinsecally different and much harder than the _ disk - bb _",
    "one , so that it is no longer possible to obtain a satisfactory fit with the mcd model .",
    "the model - model comparison approach adopted in this paper was prompted by the idea to determine the parameter space in which the mcd is in agreement with `` more physical '' standard accretion disk models and provide `` recipes '' for adjusting the estimates of the disk inner radius , the black hole mass and the accretion rate .",
    "in fact , despite the uncertainties related to radiative transfer and to the physical state of the inner disk , the parameters of the mcd fit are often used for inferring the mass and accretion rate in x - ray binaries , in particular in ulxs .",
    "the results of the comparison that we performed can be used to revise estimates of @xmath10 and @xmath25 obtained in this way .",
    "this has also been tested by applying our `` recipe procedure '' to the results from of a _ diskbb _ fit to simulated _ kerrbb _ spectra performed directly in xspec .",
    "we considered the case of a few ulxs ( ngc 1313 x-1 , ngc 1313 x-2 , m81 x-9 and ngc 4559 x-7 ) for which mcd spectral fits of their x - ray soft spectral components have been published and/or values of the bh mass estimated ( @xcite ) . from the parameters of the fit with the _ disk - bb _ ( @xmath23 and @xmath103 ) we found that , assuming that the inner disk boundary of the mcd is at or close to @xmath122 , the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be severely overestimated .",
    "adopting the appropriate value of the inner radius @xmath30 ( in units of @xmath31 ) for the _ disk - rel _ model , we obtain that the bh masses are in the range @xmath123 for ngc 1313 x-1 , ngc 1313 x-2 , m81 x-9 , and @xmath124 for ngc 4559 x-7 ( see tables  [ tab3 ] and  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "the relativistic disk models have bh masses systematically lower ( up to a factor 3 ) than those of a mcd with @xmath22 at the isco .",
    "as already mentioned , sophisticated relativistic accretion disk models ( e.g. @xcite ) that implement the relativistic structure equations and the relativistic effects on the emission and propagation of radiation , are available in xspec and can clearly be used to perform accurate fits of observed spectra , in particular for large inclination angles when the relativistic effects produce significant differences .",
    "an analysis of this type has recently been performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the bh masses for a sample of disk - dominated ulxs obtained by @xcite are below @xmath112 .",
    "even if their best fits require large values of the bh spin , bhs of several hundreds solar masses are not needed , in substantial agreement with our findings .",
    "clearly , it is possible that at least some ulxs for which curvature above @xmath77 2 - 3 kev is present in the x - ray spectrum are in a different accretion regime , in which the disk is in a diverse physical state ( accreting at or above the eddington rate ; see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this case , the assumptions of a standard accretion disk break down and different spectral models should be adopted ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the assumption that they are in a standard accretion regime ( below eddington ) , we found that , in three cases ( ngc 1313 x-1 , x-2 and m 81 x-9 ) , the black hole masses inferred for a standard disk around a schwarzschild black hole are in the interval @xmath0 . only if the black hole is maximally rotating are the masses comparable to the much larger values previously derived in the literature .",

    "<S> we compare standard models of accretion disks around black holes that include the appropriate zero - torque inner boundary condition and relativistic effects on the emission and propagation of radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison is performed adopting the multicolor disk blackbody model ( mcd ) as reference and looking for the parameter space in which it is in statistical agreement with `` more physical '' accretion disk models . </S>",
    "<S> we find simple recipes that can be used for adjusting the estimates of the physical inner radius of the disk , the black hole mass and the accretion rate inferred using the parameters of the mcd fits . </S>",
    "<S> we applied these results to four ulxs for which mcd spectral fits of their x - ray soft spectral components have been published and find that , in three cases ( ngc 1313 x-1 , x-2 and m 81 x-9 ) , the black hole masses inferred for a standard disk around a schwarzschild black hole are in the interval @xmath0 . only if the black hole is maximally rotating are the masses comparable to the much larger values previously derived in the literature .    </S>",
