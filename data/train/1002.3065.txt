    "can more sophisticated cooperation between nodes significantly increase capacity of such networks ? this is an important question concerning future communication architectures for such networks , and information theory has been brought to bear to try to shed some light on this question . adopting the scaling law formulation of gupta and kumar @xcite , much focus has been on the asymptotic regime where the number of nodes is large .",
    "two diametrically opposite answers have emerged :    * \\1 ) capacity can be significantly improved when nodes form distributed mimo arrays via an intelligent cooperation architecture @xcite .",
    "the total degrees of freedom in the network is @xmath2 , the number of nodes , and in regimes where power is not a limiting factor , the capacity can scale almost linearly with @xmath2 . *",
    "\\2 ) the total degrees of freedom in the network is not @xmath2 but is actually upper bounded by @xmath4 due to the spatial constraints imposed by the physical channel @xcite .",
    "nearest - neighbor multi - hop is optimal to achieve this scaling @xcite .",
    "this is no mathematical contradiction between these two sets of results .",
    "they are based on two different channel models .",
    "the key difference is the assumption on the phases of the channel gains between the nodes .",
    "assume that the phases are uniform and independent across the different channel gains .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , starts from physical principles and regards the phases as functions of the locations of the nodes . while the physical channel model used in @xcite is more fundamental , the i.i.d .",
    "phase model is also widely accepted in wireless communication engineering , particularly for nodes in far field from each other . is there a way to reconcile the two sets of results",
    "?    a deeper look at @xcite provides a clue .",
    "the spatial degrees of freedom limitation in @xcite is actually dictated by the _ diameter _ of the network rather than the number of nodes .",
    "more precisely , the spatial degrees of freedom in the network are limited by @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is the area of the network and @xmath1 is the carrier frequency .",
    "this number can be heuristically thought of as an upper bound to the total degrees of freedom in the network as a whole and puts a limitation on the maximum possible cooperation gain .",
    "the conclusion that the capacity scales like @xmath4 comes from the assumption that the _ density _ of nodes is fixed as the number of nodes @xmath2 grows , so that @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "but for actual networks , there can be a huge difference between @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "take an example of a network serving @xmath9 users on a campus of @xmath10 km@xmath11 , operating at @xmath12 ghz : @xmath13 , while @xmath4 is only @xmath14 , two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "so while multi - hop can achieve a total throughput of the order of @xmath14 bits / s / hz , there is still a lot of potential for cooperation gain , since the spatial degrees of freedom upper bound is @xmath15 .",
    "so the ultimate cooperation gain is limited by @xmath8 , while multi - hop performance depends on the number of nodes @xmath2 only and not on @xmath8 .",
    "but the number of nodes and the area are two independent parameters of a network , each of which can take on a wide range of values . to yield a complete picture of whether cooperation can help ,",
    "the key is to remove the artificial coupling between these two parameters and analyze the capacity in terms of the two parameters _ separately_.",
    "this is the goal of the present paper .",
    "we focus on a physical channel model similar to that used in @xcite , but with only a line - of - sight channel between each pair of nodes , a case in which spatial limitation is expected to be the most severe .",
    "our main result is that in the regime when @xmath2 and @xmath16 are both large , the capacity of the network is approximately @xmath17    accordingly , the optimal operation of the network falls into three different operating regimes :    * \\1 ) @xmath18 : the number of spatial degrees of freedom is too small , cooperation is useless and nearest neighbor multi - hopping is optimal . *",
    "\\2 ) @xmath19 : the number of spatial degrees of freedom is @xmath2 , cooperation is very useful , and the optimal performance can be achieved by the same hierarchical cooperation scheme introduced in @xcite . spatial degree of freedom limitation does not come into play and the performance is _ as though _ the phases are i.i.d .",
    "uniform across the nodes .",
    "* \\3 ) @xmath20 : the number of degrees of freedom is smaller than @xmath2 , so the spatial limitation is felt , but larger than what can be achieved by simple multi - hopping . a modification of the hierarchical cooperation scheme achieves optimal scaling in this regime .    regime ( 1 ) is essentially the conclusion of @xcite ; regime ( 2 ) is essentially the conclusion of @xcite ( in the case when power is not a limiting factor ) .",
    "thus , the validity of the results in these papers is not universal but depends on the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath16 .",
    "the _ upper bound _ of @xmath8 on the spatial degrees of freedom of the network is already established by @xcite .",
    "the main technical contributions of the present paper are two - folded : 1 ) we show that there are actually @xmath6 spatial degrees of freedom available in the physical channel model when @xmath21 ; 2 ) we show that hierarchical cooperation can achieve these degrees of freedom .    both mathematically and philosophically , the present paper follows the same spirit of @xcite .",
    "@xcite advocates a shift of the `` large networks '' research agenda from seeking a single `` universal '' scaling law , where the number of nodes @xmath2 scales with all systems parameters coupled with @xmath2 in a specific way , to seeking a _ multi - parameter family _ of scaling laws , where the key parameters are decoupled and many different limits with respect to these parameters are taken .",
    "a single scaling law with a particular coupling between parameters is often arbitrary and too restrictive to cover the wide ranges that the multiple parameters of the network can take on .",
    "the specific parameters that were decoupled in @xcite were the number of nodes and the amount of power available .",
    "the current paper follows the approach of @xcite , but focuses on the number of nodes and the area of the network , while assuming there is a sufficient amount of power available that it is not limiting performance .",
    "a future goal of this research program is to investigate the dependence of the capacity on the number of nodes , the area of the network and the amount of power all together .",
    "there are @xmath2 nodes with transmitting and receiving capabilities that are uniformly and independently distributed in a rectangle of area @xmath22 .",
    "each node has an average transmit power budget of @xmath23 watts and the network is allocated a total bandwidth of @xmath24 hertz around a carrier frequency of @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "every node is both a source and a destination for some traffic request .",
    "the sources and destinations are randomly paired up one - to - one into @xmath2 source - destination pairs without any consideration on node locations .",
    "each source wants to communicate to its destination at the same rate @xmath27 bits / s / hz . the aggregate throughput of the system is @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that communication takes place in free - space line of sight type environment and the complex baseband - equivalent channel gain between node @xmath29 and node @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the distance between the nodes @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath1 is the carrier wavelength .",
    "note that the locations of the users are drawn randomly but remain fixed over the duration of the communication .",
    "therefore for a given realization of the network , the channel coefficients in ( [ eq : ch_model0 ] ) are deterministic .    the parameter @xmath33 is given by the friis formula , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the transmitter and receiver antenna gains respectively .",
    "the discrete - time complex baseband signal received by node @xmath29 at time @xmath37 is given by @xmath38=\\sum_{\\substack{k=1,\\,k\\neq i}}^{n}h_{ik}x_k[m]+z_i[m]\\ ] ] where @xmath39 $ ] is the signal sent by node @xmath30 at time @xmath37 subject to an average power constraint @xmath40 and @xmath41 $ ] is complex white circularly symmetric gaussian noise of variance @xmath42 .",
    "the model in ( [ eq : ch_model0 ] ) , corresponds to free - space propagation .",
    "it is equivalent to the model in section iv of @xcite but with no scatterers .",
    "we consider the case of no scatterers since the spatial degrees of freedom limitation is expected to be most severe in this case .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that a wireless adhoc network is power - limited when the long - range @xmath43 in the network is smaller than @xmath44 db and the long range @xmath43 has been identified as @xmath45 for the current case @xmath46 , which implies that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the @xmath43 in a point - to - point transmission over the typical nearest neighbor distance in the network .",
    "( see also @xcite . ) in the present paper , our goal is to concentrate on the effect of the spatial degrees of freedom limitation on the capacity of wireless adhoc networks . to be able to solely concentrate on this factor , we assume there is no power limitation in our network .",
    "formally , we assume that @xmath23 and @xmath24 are such that @xmath49 for every @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "for the current case of @xmath46 , the condition can be equivalently stated as @xmath50 db .",
    "when this condition fails to hold , the network becomes power limited and the behavior of the capacity as well as optimal operation can be significantly different .",
    "the main result of @xcite is to show that under the network and the channel model described in the previous section with the additional restriction @xmath51 , the capacity of the wireless network is upper bounded by @xmath52 with high probability as @xmath53 . ] , where @xmath54 is a constant independent of @xmath2 .",
    "coupling the area of the network a priori with the number of nodes in the network is restrictive and does not allow to deduce the nature of the limitation imposed here .",
    "a relatively straightforward generalization of the analysis in @xcite gives the following result .",

    "the achievability remains an open issue so far .",

    "when @xmath65 , hierarchical cooperation can achieve an aggregate throughput @xmath66 . note that this throughput is larger than @xmath4 , when @xmath59",
    "the proof of theorem [ sqrta0 ] relies on the following lemma which establishes a lower bound on the capacity of a mimo transmission between two clusters of nodes . for notational simplicity , in the sequel",

    "note that when the distances @xmath32 are expressed in wavelength units , the channel model in , takes the simplified form , @xmath67    [ aoverd ] consider two square clusters of area @xmath68 separated by a distance @xmath69 ( see figure  [ squares ] ) , with each cluster containing @xmath70 nodes distributed uniformly at random over @xmath68 .",

    "the condition ensures that the mimo transmission is not power limited . for the los case",
    ", we have the additional term @xmath78 , which corresponds to the spatial degrees of freedom between the two clusters . when this term is smaller than @xmath70 , the capacity of the mimo transmission is not any more linear in @xmath70 .",
    "this in turn degrades the performance of the hierarchical cooperation scheme which is based on such mimo transmissions .",
    "the capacity of a mimo transmission between two clusters under the current los channel model has been investigated earlier in @xcite .",
    "the result stated in theorem  1 of @xcite is equivalent to lemma  [ aoverd ] above .",
    "however , the proof of theorem  1 in @xcite is based on an approximation which is not fully justified . through private communication ,",
    "we have been informed of a follow - up work @xcite by the same authors , that similarly to our current paper investigates the performance of the hierarchical cooperation scheme under the los channel model .",
    "next , we investigate the performance of the hierarchical cooperation scheme and show how lemma  [ aoverd ] allows to prove the result in theorem  [ sqrta0 ] .",
    "the core of the proof is the following recursion lemma .",
    "[ lem : rec ] consider a network of @xmath2 nodes uniformly distributed over an area @xmath59 and the available power @xmath23 per node satisfies ( [ eq : snr_l ] ) .",
    "assume that there exists a communication scheme for this network that achieves an aggregate throughput @xmath79 with high probability for some @xmath80 and a constant @xmath81 independent of @xmath2 and @xmath57 .",
    "then , we can construct another scheme for this network that achieves a higher aggregate throughput @xmath82 with high probability for any @xmath83 and a constant @xmath84 independent of @xmath2 and @xmath57 .",
    "as soon as we have a scheme to start with , lemma  [ lem : rec ] can be applied recursively , yielding a scheme that achieves higher throughput at each step of the recursion .",
    "note that @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "we first show that a simple time - sharing strategy between the source - destination pairs ( tdma ) satisfies the conditions of the lemma with @xmath87 .",
    "note that with tdma , each source node transmits only a fraction @xmath88 of the total time of communication .",
    "hence when active , each source node can transmit with elevated power @xmath89 and still satisfy its average power constraint @xmath23 .",
    "this yields an snr larger than @xmath90 in ( [ def : snrl ] ) for each transmission , hence a constant rate .",
    "therefore , the aggregate throughput achieved by tdma is constant independent of @xmath2 and @xmath57 .    starting with tdma , @xmath87 , and applying lemma  [ lem : rec ] recursively @xmath91 times",

    ", we provide a brief overview of the three - phase scheme from lemma  3.1 in @xcite and verify that it achieves the same performance in @xcite under the current deterministic phase model .",
    "the reader should refer to @xcite for a precise analysis . for the case",
    "@xmath98 , a modification of the scheme is required to achieve the performance given in lemma  [ lem : rec ] .",

    "each cluster contains approximately @xmath99 nodes .",
    "a particular source node @xmath100 sends @xmath70 bits to its destination node @xmath69 in three steps :    * node @xmath100 first distributes its @xmath70 bits among the @xmath70 nodes in its cluster , one bit for each node ; * these nodes together can then form a distributed transmit antenna array , sending the @xmath70 bits _ simultaneously _ to the destination cluster where @xmath69 lies ; * each node in the destination cluster observes the mimo transmission in the previous phase ; it quantizes each observation to @xmath101 bits , with a fixed @xmath101 , and ships them to @xmath69 , which can then do joint mimo processing of all the quantized observations and decode the @xmath70 transmitted bits from @xmath100 .    from the network point of view",
    ", all source - destination pairs have to eventually accomplish these three steps .",
    "step 2 is long - range communication and only one source - destination pair can operate at a time .",
    "steps 1 and 3 involve local communication and can be parallelized across clusters .",
    "since there are @xmath70 source nodes in every cluster , this gives a total traffic of exchanging @xmath102 bits inside each cluster in phase 1 .",
    "we can handle this traffic by setting up @xmath70 sub - phases , and assigning @xmath70 pairs in each sub - phase to communicate their @xmath10 bit .",
    "the traffic to be handled at each sub - phase is similar to our original network communication problem with @xmath2 users on an area @xmath57 , but now instead , we have @xmath70 users on area @xmath68 .",
    "we handle this traffic using the communication scheme given in lemma  [ lem : rec ] .",
    "note that if this scheme achieves an aggregate throughput @xmath103 in the network of @xmath2 nodes and area @xmath57 , it will achieve an aggregate rate @xmath104 inside the clusters of @xmath70 nodes and area @xmath68 .",
    "this can be verified by checking that the clusters of @xmath70 nodes and area @xmath68 satisfy the conditions of the lemma .",
    "we have @xmath105 for the clusters if @xmath59 for the original network and @xmath106 if @xmath23 satisfies ( [ eq : snr_l ] ) .",
    "moreover when @xmath63 , we have @xmath107 , so the performance of the scheme is @xmath108 .",
    "the traffic in the third phase is handled similarly to the first phase .",
    "then , we need :    * @xmath109 time slots to complete phase 1 all over the network ; we handle the traffic in @xmath70 subphases , each subphase is completed in @xmath110 time - slots .",
    "* @xmath111 time - slots to complete the successive mimo transmissions in the second phase , _ if the distributed mimo transmissions between any two clusters can achieve a rate of @xmath112 bits / time - slot _ ; we perform one mimo transmission for each of the @xmath2 source - destination pairs in the network . * @xmath113 time slots to complete phase 3 all over the network ; the traffic in the third phase is symmetrical to the traffic in the first phase , but larger by a factor of @xmath114 .",
    "this factor comes from the fact that each mimo transmission lasts @xmath115 time slots , and each of the corresponding @xmath115 observations is quantized to @xmath101 bits .    in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that each destination node is able to decode the transmitted bits from its source node from the @xmath70 quantized signals it gathers by the end of phase 3 .",
    "thus , the aggregate throughput achieved by the scheme can be calculated as follows : each source node is able to transmit @xmath70 bits to its destination node , hence @xmath116 bits in total are delivered to their destinations in @xmath117 time slots , yielding an aggregate throughput of @xmath118 choosing @xmath119 to maximize this expression yields an aggregate throughput @xmath120 for a constant @xmath84 .",
    "note that this throughput can only be achieved if the mimo transmissions in phase 2 achieve a rate linear in @xmath70 .",
    "the rate of the mimo transmissions are lowerbounded in theorem  [ aoverd ] for the deterministic phase model under certain conditions .",
    "the cluster areas and the separation between the clusters should satisfy the condition @xmath71 and the users should transmit with power satisfying condition ( [ powermimo ] ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath71 .",
    "note that @xmath121 is always true unless the communicating clusters are neighbors .",
    "let us verify that the power condition ( [ powermimo ] ) for the mimo transmission can be satisfied under the average power constraint @xmath23 per node satisfying ( [ eq : snr_l ] ) . in the second phase , the mimo transmissions between clusters are performed successively and each node in the network transmits only @xmath122 of the time .",
    "therefore when active , each node can transmit with elevated power @xmath123and still satisfy its average power constraint @xmath23 .",

    "@xmath97 , the proof of the lemma differs from the earlier case @xmath63 in two aspects .",
    "when @xmath97 , the mimo transmissions between the clusters are limited in spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "more precisely , in theorem  [ aoverd ] , the performance is lower bounded by the second term @xmath78 and it is not anymore linear in @xmath70 .",
    "this fact requires a modification in the operation of this phase .",
    "the second difference is the following : we have seen that when @xmath63 for the original network , we have @xmath107 for the smaller clusters .",
    "in other words , when the network is not spatial degrees of freedom limited at the largest scale , it is not spatial degrees of freedom limited at any scale . in the current case , when @xmath97 , the network is limited in spatial degrees of freedom at the largest scale , but the smaller clusters may or may not be spatial degrees of freedom limited .",
    "more precisely , for a cluster of smaller size , we can either have @xmath132 or @xmath107 .",

    "we use this scheme to handle the traffic inside the clusters in phases 1 and 3 as before . in the second phase ,",
    "the mimo transmissions achieve a rate @xmath142 this implies that in the second phase , the mimo transmissions for each source - destination pair can not be completed in constant number of time - slots as before . in order for these mimo transmissions of lower rate not to result in too many mimo observations in the third phase containing a small number of degrees of freedom , we introduce the following modification to step ( s2 ) .",
    "let @xmath143 we randomly divide the @xmath70 nodes in the source cluster to @xmath144 groups each containing @xmath145 nodes .",
    "we do the same division also in the destination cluster .",

    "in each of these @xmath147 mimo transmissions , a group of @xmath145 nodes in the source cluster are simultaneously transmitting their bits to their corresponding group in the destination cluster .",
