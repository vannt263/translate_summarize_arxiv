    "have highly sub - eddington luminosities ( @xmath105 ) , their accretion structures should be physically similar ( see , e.g. , soria et al .",
    "2006 for discussion of inefficient flow models ) .",
    "one obvious parameter that could link nuclear activity to the large - scale environment is the fuel supply .",
    "hot gas is subject to offsetting effects in clusters , with ram pressure stripping countered by accretion from the icm and potential confinement of winds ( brown & bregman 2000 ) , but radio and optical observations establish cold gas and younger stellar populations as more prevalent in field early - type galaxies ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "major tidal interactions , which are less frequent within clusters due to the large galaxy velocity dispersions , could help bring gas to the nucleus , although this is not required as stochastic events may suffice for low - level fueling ( as conjectured for seyferts ; hopkins & hernquist  2006 ) . while accretion in local early - type galaxies does not appear to be limited by gas supply ( soria et al .",
    "2006 ; pellegrini 2010 ) , a @xmath92@xmath106 larger infall rate ( small in absolute terms ; e.g. , allen et al .",

    "the field sample contains galaxies in groups spanning a range in richness , as well as triples , pairs , or isolated galaxies .",
    "groups are intermediate between field and clusters in terms of strength of galaxy - medium interactions , but facilitate strong galaxy - galaxy interactions because the bulk speeds of the galaxies are lower ( somewhat similar to cluster outskirts ) . an apparent smooth decrease in scaled luminosities from isolated to group to cluster environments , albeit with large scatter ,",
    "was interpreted by m11 as tentative evidence of environmental modulation of supermassive black hole fueling .",
    "the direct comparison between field and cluster galaxies conducted in this work supports that possibility .",
    "the robust result that these virgo early - type galaxies are not systematically more luminous than their field counterparts indicates that low - level black hole activity is not generally stronger within typical cluster galaxies .",
    "this result is supported by the insensitivity to environment of the fractional rate of -identified agns ( martini et al .  2007 ;",
    "haggard et al .  2010 ) .",
    "presuming nuclear emission correlates with the total energy and momentum output of these weakly accreting black holes ( @xmath201 ) , this implies low - level agn feedback is not generally stronger within typical cluster galaxies than in the field .",
    "this supports that the older stellar populations in cluster early - type galaxies , and the associated paucity of ongoing star formation , are not directly due to recent black hole activity .",
    "possibly past agn outbursts could have already suppressed star formation and expelled gas from cluster galaxies , leaving no obvious current link . both star formation ( moran et al .  2005 ) and agn activity ( ruderman & ebeling 2005 ) may be triggered at infall near the cluster virial radius , either through environmental or galaxy interactions .",
    "the agn fraction increases with redshift ( e.g. , martini et al .",
    "2009 ; haggard et al .  2010",
    "; aird et al .",
    "2011 ) , and at @xmath107 may be significantly higher in clusters ( lehmer et al .",
    "however , given that supermassive black hole activity is not generally greater within clusters in the local universe , this scenario requires agn activity to be terminated or reduced more rapidly within clusters . while various environmental effects may remove gas otherwise available for agn fueling in clusters , as described above , this depletion also acts to quench star formation and so it is unclear that past agn activity is required for this task .",
    "our findings are consistent with other arguments that agn activity is not the proximate cause of star formation quenching , including the observed gradual decline in remnant star formation with decreasing cluster radius which led moran et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to associate the cessation of star formation with a slow - acting effect such as starvation ( see also von der linden et al .",
    "2010 ) , and the similarity in the distribution of luminosities for @xmath108 which led aird et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . ] to state no evidence for agn - quenching .",
    "we note bcgs occupy a privileged position centered within the cluster potential and show direct evidence ( @xmath201 ) of mechanical agn feedback .",
    "an additional complication is that bcgs in cool core clusters do show recent star formation related to the cooling gas ( hicks et al .",
    "2010 ) , again distinguishing them from typical cluster galaxies .",
    "our cluster sample is exclusive to virgo , so we do not investigate bcgs in general , but our conclusions about the importance of environmental effects versus agn feedback likely do not apply to bcgs .",
