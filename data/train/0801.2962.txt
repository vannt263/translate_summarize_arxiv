    "following john wheeler , many physicists ( including the author ) believe that space is composed of an ever - changing arrangement of bubbles called spacetime foam , also known as quantum foam . to understand the terminology ,",
    "let us consider the following simplified analogy which wheeler gave in a conference on gravity at university of north carolina in 1957 .",
    "imagine yourself flying an airplane over an ocean . at high altitude",
    "the ocean appears smooth .",
    "but as you descend , it begins to show roughness .",
    "close enough to the ocean surface , you see bubbles and foam .",
    "analogously , spacetime appears smooth on a large scale , but on sufficiently small scales , it will appear rough and foamy , hence the term `` spacetime foam '' @xcite .",
    "many physicists believe the foaminess is due to quantum fluctuations of spacetime , hence the alternative term `` quantum foam . ''",
    "this reveiw article is devoted to a discussion of spacetime foam models , or rather , a specific one of them for which the concept of entropy plays a crucial role @xcite .",
    "the only ingredients we use in the whole discussion are quantum mechanics and general relativity , the two pillars of modern physics .",
    "we hope that the results are very general and have wider validity than most of the candidates of quantum gravity theory .",
    "assuming that there is a unity of physics connecting the planck scale to the cosmic scale , we also apply quantum foam physics to cosmology @xcite .    in the next section , by a process of mapping the geometry of a region of spacetime ,",
    "we show how foamy spacetime is .",
    "it turns out that the degree of foaminess of spacetime determines the maximum amount of entropy a spatial region can hold .",
    "this maximum amount of information can be shown to be consistent with that encoded in the holographic principle which has its origin in black hole physics .",
    "appropriately this spacetime foam model has come to be known as the holographic model . in section 3",
    ", we propose to probe spacetime foam by looking for halos in the images of distant quasars or bright active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "there we show that the archive from the hubble space telescople ( hst ) can already be used to yield useful bounds . among the spacetime foam models ,",
    "the holographic foam model is unique in its correspondence with the case of maximum energy density that a spatial region can hold without collapsing into a black hole .",
    "applied to cosmology it  predicts \" a critical energy density as observed in recent years .",
    "this potential connection between the extremely large and the extremely small is explored in section 4 ; there we show that the archive on quasars and agn from hst can be used , in conjuction with the physics of quantum computation , to  prove \" the existence of dark energy , _ independent _ of the various cosmological observations of recent years .",
    "indeed , from our perspective , dark energy is arguably a cosmological manifestation of quantum foam ! in section 5 , we examine how and why dark energy is so different from ordinary energy / matter .",
    "there we show that the holographic model of spacetime foam naturally leads us to speculate that dark energy consists of an incredibly large number of extremely - long - wavelength  particles \" .",
    "then we exploit the positivity of the entropy for these particles to show that they obey not the ordinary bose or fermi statistics , but the exotic infinite statistics ( also known as quantum boltzmann statistics ) .",
    "we start our discussion with holography and end with infinite statistics .",
    "we conclude section 5 by speculating that the nonlocality known to be present in both of them may be related to each other .",
    "we give a summary in section 6 .    for completeness , we discuss various other relevant topics of spacetime foam physics in six short appendices . in appendix a , using a gedanken experiment to measure distances we rederive the holographic foam model . in appendix b",
    ", we apply the results in appendix a to set bounds on the accuracies of clocks and limits on computations , and derive the black hole entropy and lifetime .",
    "we derive the holographic principle and the margolus - levitin theorem ( which is liberally used in the text ) in appendices c and d respectively .",
    "appendix e is devoted to a discussion of the uncertainties in energy - momentum measurements consistent with spacetime foam . in appendix",
    "f we apply the results obtained in appendix e to discuss high - energy @xmath0 rays from distant gamma ray bursts and ultra - high energy cosmic ray events .    on notations ,",
    "the subscript `` p '' denotes planck units ; thus @xmath1 cm is the planck length etc . on units , @xmath2 (",
    "the boltzmann constant ) and sometimes @xmath3 and c are put equal to 1 for simplicity .",
    "if spacetime indeed undergoes quantum fluctuations , the fluctuations will show up when we measure a distance @xmath4 , in the form of uncertainties in the measurement .",
    "the question now is : how accurately can we measure this distance ?",
    "let us denote by @xmath5 the accuracy with which we can measure @xmath4 .",
    "we will also refer to @xmath5 as the uncertainty or fluctuation of the distance @xmath4 for reasons that will become obvious shortly .",
    "one way to find @xmath5 is to carry out a gedanken experiment to measure @xmath4 .",
    "this is done in appendix a. but , for later use , it is more convenient to find @xmath5 by carrying out a process of mapping the geometry of spacetime .",
    "this method @xcite relies on the fact that quantum fluctuations of spacetime manifest themselves in the form of uncertainties in the geometry of spacetime .",
    "hence the structure of spacetime foam can be inferred from the accuracy with which we can measure that geometry .",
    "let us consider mapping out the geometry of spacetime for a spherical volume of radius @xmath4 over the amount of time @xmath6 it takes light to cross the volume .",
    "one way to do this is to fill the space with clocks , exchanging signals with other clocks and measuring the signals times of arrival .",
    "this process of mapping the geometry of spacetime is a kind of computation , in which distances are gauged by transmitting and processing information .",
    "the total number of operations , including the ticks of the clocks and the measurements of signals , is bounded by the margolus - levitin theorem @xcite(see appendix d ) in quantum computation , which stipulates that the rate of operations for any computer can not exceed the amount of energy @xmath7 that is available for computation divided by @xmath8 .",
    "a total mass @xmath9 of clocks then yields , via the margolus - levitin theorem , the bound on the total number of operations given by @xmath10 . but to prevent black hole formation , @xmath9 must be less than @xmath11 .",
    "together , these two limits imply that the total number of operations that can occur in a spatial volume of radius @xmath4 for a time period @xmath12 is no greater than @xmath13 . to maximize spatial resolution",
    ", each clock must tick only once during the entire time period .",
    "the operations can be regarded as partitioning the spacetime volume into `` cells '' , then on the average each cell occupies a spatial volume no less than @xmath14 , yielding an average separation between neighhoring cells no less than @xmath15 .",
    "this spatial separation is interpreted as the average minimum uncertainty @xcite in the measurement of a distance @xmath4 , that is , @xmath16 where and henceforth ( with a couple of exceptions ) we drop multiplicative factors of order @xmath17 .",
    "+      we can now understand why this quantum foam model has come to be known as the holographic model .",
    "since , on the average , each cell occupies a spatial volume of @xmath18 , a spatial region of size @xmath4 can contain no more than @xmath19 cells .",
    "thus this model corresponds to the case of maximum number of bits of information @xmath20 in a spatial region of size @xmath4 , that is allowed by the holographic principle @xcite ( see appendixc ) . to see this more concretely ,",
    "consider a cubic region of space with linear dimension @xmath4 .",
    "conventional wisdom claims that the region can be partitioned into cubes as small as @xmath21 .",
    "it follows that the number of degrees of freedom of the region is bounded by @xmath22 , i.e. , the volume of the region in planck units .",
    "but conventional wisdom is wrong , for according to eq .",
    "( [ vd2 ] ) , the smallest cubes into which we can partition the region can not have a linear dimension smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the number of degrees of freedom of the region is bounded by @xmath24 ^ 3 $ ] , i.e. , the area of the region in planck units , as stipulated by the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "recently gambini and pullin @xcite have shown that holography follows from the framework of loop quantum gravity in spherical symmetry .",
    "they have derived from first principles an uncertainty in the determination of volumes that grows radially ( corresponding to the @xmath4 above ) ; i.e. , they have recovered eq .",
    "( [ vd2 ] ) .",
    "it will prove to be useful to compare the holographic model in the mapping of the geometry of spacetime with the one that corresponds to spreading the spacetime cells uniformly in both space and time .",
    "for the latter case , each cell has the size of @xmath25 both spatially and temporally so that each clock ticks once in the time it takes to communicate with a neighboring clock .",
    "since the dependence on @xmath26 is the hallmark of a random - walk fluctuation , this quantum foam model corresponding to @xmath27 is called the random - walk model @xcite .",
    "compared to the holographic model , the random - walk model predicts a coarser spatial resolution , i.e. , a larger distance fluctuation , in the mapping of spacetime geometry .",
    "it also yields a smaller bound on the information content in a spatial region , viz .",
    ", @xmath28 bits .",
    "actually there are many other models of spacetime foam , in addition to the holographic model and the random - walk model .",
    "we can parametrize them according to @xmath29 for @xmath30 of order 1 , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the holographic model and the random - walk model respectively @xcite .",
    "note that the minimum @xmath5 just found for the holographic model corresponds to the case of maximum energy density @xmath33 for a sphere of radius @xmath4 not to collapse into a black hole .",
    "hence the holographic model , unlike the other models , requires , for its consistency , the energy density to have the critical value . by contrast , for instance , the random - walk model corresponds to an energy density @xmath34 .",
    "( the upper bound corresponds to the clocks ticking every @xmath35 while the lower bound corresponds to the clocks ticking only once during the entire time @xmath36 . ) +      let us examine the cumulative effects @xcite of spacetime fluctuations over a large distance . consider a distance @xmath4 , and divide it into @xmath37 equal parts each of which has length @xmath38 ( that can be as small as @xmath39 ) .",
    "if we start with @xmath40 from each part , the question is how do the @xmath37 parts add up to @xmath5 for the whole distance @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , we want to find the cumulative factor @xmath41 defined by @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the result is @xmath45 . note that the cumulative factor is _ not _ linear in @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "( in general , it is much smaller than @xmath48 ) .",
    "the reason for this is obvious : the @xmath40 s ( which take on @xmath49 sign with equal probability ) from the @xmath37 parts in @xmath4 do _ not _ add coherently .",
    "in general , for spacetime foam models corresponding to @xmath50 , the cumulative factor is given by @xmath51 .",
    "thus for the random - walk model , the cumulative factor is @xmath52 .",
    "note that for the holographic case , the individual fluctuations can not be completely random ( as opposed to the random - walk model ) ; strangely successive fluctuations appear to be entangled and somewhat anti - correlated ( i.e. , a plus fluctuation is slightly more likely followed by a minus fluctuation and vice versa ) , in order that together they produce a total fluctuation less than that in the random - walk model .",
    "this small amount of anti - correlation between successive fluctuations ( corresponding to what statisticians call fractional brownian motion with self - similarity parameter @xmath53 ) must be due to quantum gravity effects .    on the other hand , if successive fluctuations are completely anti - correlated , then the fluctuation of a distance @xmath4 is given by the minuscule @xmath39 , independent of the size of the distance . for completeness",
    ", we mention that _ a priori _ there are also models with positive correlations between successive fluctuations .",
    "but these models yield unacceptably large fluctuations in distance measurements  it turns out ( see next section ) that these models ( actually all models with @xmath54 corresponding to the hatched line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) have already been observationally ruled out .",
    "+     for the various quantum gravity models .",
    "the fluctuation of a distance @xmath4 is given by the sum of @xmath55 fluctuations each by plus or minus @xmath39 .",
    "spacetime foam appears to choose a small anti - correlation ( i.e. , negative correlation ) between successive fluctuations , giving a cube root dependence in the number @xmath56 of fluctuations for the total fluctuation of @xmath4 ( indicated by the arrow ) .",
    "the corresponding model falls between the two extreme cases of complete randomness , i.e. , zero correlation ( corresponding to @xmath57 ) and complete anti - correlation ( corresponding to @xmath58 ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] , width=336 ]",
    "the planck length @xmath59 cm is so short that we need an astronomical ( even cosmological ) distance @xmath4 for its fluctuation @xmath60 to be detectable .",
    "let us consider light ( with wavelength @xmath38 ) from distant quasars or bright active galactic nuclei @xcite . due to the quantum fluctuations of spacetime , the wavefront , while planar , is itself  foamy \" , having random fluctuations in phase @xcite @xmath61 and in the direction of the wave vector @xcite given by @xmath62 ( for @xmath63 ) . in effect , spacetime foam creates a  seeing disk \" whose angular diameter is @xmath64 .",
    "for an interferometer with baseline length @xmath65 , this means that dispersion will be seen as a spread in the angular size of a distant point source , causing a reduction in the fringe visibility when @xmath66 . for a quasar of 1 gpc away , at infrared wavelength ,",
    "the holographic model predicts a phase fluctuation @xmath67 radians . on the other hand , an infrared interferometer ( like the very large telescope interferometer ) with @xmath68 meters",
    "has @xmath69 .",
    "thus , in principle , this method will allow the use of interferometry fringe patterns to test the holographic model !",
    "furthermore , these tests can be carried out without guaranteed time using archived high resolution , deep imaging data on quasars , and possibly , supernovae from existing and upcoming telescopes .",
    "the key issue here is the sensitivity of the interferometer .",
    "the lack of observed fringes may simply be due to the lack of sufficient flux ( or even just effects originated from the turbulence of the earth s atmosphere ) rather than the possibility that the instrument has resolved a spacetime foam generated halo .",
    "but , given sufficient sensitivity , the vlti , for example , with its maximum baseline , presumably has sufficient resolution to detect spacetime foam halos for low redshift quasars , and in principle , it can be even more effective for the higher redshift quasars .",
    "note that the test is simply a question of the detection or non - detection of fringes .",
    "it is not a question of mapping the structure of the predicted halo .    in the meantime",
    ", we can use existing archived data on quasars or active galactic nuclei from the hubble space telescope to test the quantum foam models @xcite . consider the case of pks1413 + 135 @xcite , an agn for which the redshift is @xmath70 . with @xmath71 gpc and @xmath72 m",

    "thus , the hst image only fails to test the holographic model by 3 orders of magnitude .    however , the absence of a quantum foam induced halo structure in the hst image of pks1413 + 135 rules out convincingly the random - walk model .",
    "( in fact , the scaling relation discussed above indicates that all spacetime foam models with @xmath77 are ruled out by this hst observation . )",

    "we can draw a useful conclusion @xcite from the _ observed _ cosmic critical density in the present era ( consistent with the prediction of the cosmology based on the holographic model of spacetime foam , which henceforth we call the holographic foam cosmology ( hfc ) ) @xmath78 ( about @xmath79 joule per cubic meter ) , where @xmath80 is the present hubble parameter of the observable universe and @xmath81 is the hubble radius . treating the whole universe as a computer@xcite",

    "hence , assuming only ordinary matter exists to store all the information in the universe results in the conclusion that the time to communicate with neighboring bits is equal to the time for each bit to flip once .",
    "it follows that the accuracy to which ordinary matter maps out the geometry of spacetime corresponds exactly to the case of events spread out uniformly in space and time discussed above for the case of the random - walk model of spacetime foam .",
    "but , as shown in the previous section , the sharp images of distant quasars or active galactic nuclei observed at the hubble space telescope have ruled out the random - walk model . from the demise of the random - walk model and the fact that ordinary matter only contains an amount of information dense enough to map out spacetime at a level consistent with the random - walk model",
    ", one can now infer that spacetime must be mapped to a finer spatial accuracy than that which is possible with the use of ordinary matter .",
    "but if ordinary matter does not do , there must be another kind of substance with which spacetime can be mapped to the observed accuracy , conceivably as given by the holographic model .",

    "such a non - unitary evolution leads to potentially observable decoherence , e.g. , in a system of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "these authors have further claimed that , in real life , one could never observe the black hole information paradox , since quantum states decohere ( due to our lack of perfect clocks ) at a rate faster than the one an evaporating black hole makes it disappear .",
