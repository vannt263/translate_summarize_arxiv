    "bose - einstein condensates with dipole - dipole interaction have drawn significant interests over the past few years  @xcite .",
    "in particular , after the experimental observations of dipolar effects in cr condensates  @xcite and in spin-1 rb  @xcite condensates , the study of dipolar quantum gases is at the forefront of both theoretical and experimental research .",
    "armed with the technique of feshbach resonance which tunes the short - range @xmath0-wave scattering length , experimentalists have investigated the stability and the anisotropic collapse of the cr condensate  @xcite .",
    "in addition , dipolar effects have also been observed in condensates of k  @xcite and li  @xcite atoms which only possess small magnetic dipole moments .",
    "owing to the large electric dipole moment of the polar molecules , recent success in making high phase - space - density gas of polar molecules  @xcite provides an even more promising platform for the study the dipolar quantum many - body system .",
    "the long - range and anisotropic characters of the dipolar interaction have profound impact on the properties of quantum gases .",
    "for example , when loaded into a optical lattice , the long - range repulsive dipole - dipole interaction breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice such that the density wave phases can be formed  @xcite . in the presence of vortices  @xcite or a small perturbation in the trapping potential  @xcite",
    ", the radial density profile of the condensate was found to develop oscillations .",
    "of particular interest is that , even for a singly trapped dipolar condensate , a biconcave density profile can be found in a pancake - shape trap  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the maximum density occurs at the periphery of the condensate , resembling the shape of a red blood cell .",
    "et al_. have proposed to detect the biconcave density profile by tuning the contact interaction to induce local collapse  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we systematically investigate the ground state structure and the free expansion dynamics of a harmonically trapped dipolar condensate . for a given trap geometry ,",
    "we map out the stability diagrams on the parameter plane of the interaction strengths .",
    "in addition to the biconcave dipolar condensates in pancake - shaped traps , a dumbbell density profile can be induced in cigar - shaped trap when the dipolar interaction is properly tuned .",
    "for simplicity , both biconcave and dumbbell density profiles are referred to as density oscillations in the condensates . on stability diagram ,",
    "the density oscillation occurs only when the interaction strengths fall into certain isolated areas , which is called as density oscillation island ( doi ) .",
    "we also find the relation between the position of doi and the trap geometry by fitting the numerical results . finally , by studying the free expansion of the condensate with density oscillation",
    ", we show that the density oscillation can be identified in the time - of - flight image .",
    "we will also consider dipolar condensate trapped in box potentials .",
    "we show that the rigid walls of box potentials in general induce more pronounced density oscillations over a much larger region of the parameter space than harmonic potentials .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ stheo ] , we briefly outline our model . in sec .",
    "[ snum ] , we introduce the numerical method used to compute the dipolar mean - field . the numerical results on both the ground state wave function of harmonically trapped dipolar condensates and the corresponding free expansion dynamics are presented in sec .  [ sresu ] . in sec .",

    "we consider a trapped condensate of @xmath1 bosons with dipole moments @xmath2 .",
    "particles interact with each other via contact interaction @xmath3 and dipole - dipole interaction @xmath4 .",
    "the total interaction potential takes the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the mass of the particle and @xmath8 being the @xmath0-wave scattering length tunable through feshbach resonance , @xmath9 is the polar angle of @xmath10 , and @xmath11 $ ] is a parameter continuously tunable via an orienting field which rotates rapidly around @xmath12-axis  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the factor @xmath13 makes the dipolar interaction between polarized dipoles tunable . for positive @xmath13 ,",
    "the dipolar force is repulsive ( attractive ) if two dipole moments aligned side by side ( head to tail ) .",
    "however , the opposite becomes true for negative @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the trapping potential is assumed to be axially symmetric @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the radial frequency and @xmath16 is trap aspect ratio such that the axially frequency of the trap is @xmath17 .",

    "( [ gp3d ] ) , the control parameters of the system are reduced to @xmath16 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 . we shall show how the condensate stability and the structure of the wave function depend on these parameters .",

    "the numerical solution of the ground state wave function can be obtained by evolving eq .",
    "( [ gp3d ] ) in imaginary time .",
    "compared to the gross - pitaevskii equation with only contact interaction , the difficulty of solving eq .",

    "( [ phidd ] ) , it becomes apparent that @xmath34 can be efficiently calculated in momentum space using fast fourier transform ( fft )  @xcite .",
    "moreover , taking advantage of the cylindric symmetry of the system , ronen _",
    "et al_.  @xcite further reduce the 2d fourier transform in @xmath35 plane into an 1d hankel transform of order @xmath36 for the ground state wave function by integrating over the azimuthal variable .",
    "this procedure greatly simplifies the 3d calculation to a 2d one in the @xmath37-@xmath12 plane .",
    "the fact that fft implicitly treats the system as a periodic one makes our system a 3d periodic lattice of condensates .",

    "this procedure works well in nearly spherical traps .",
    "however , for cigar- or pancake - shaped trapping potential , one can not find a sphere which only contains a single condensate . here",

    "( [ cylcut ] ) are previously obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the remaining integral term can be easily worked out using numerical integration . with a gaussian wave function",
    ", we have confirmed that the precision of the dipolar interaction energy is improved significantly by introducing cylindrical truncation on @xmath4 .",
    "before we conclude this section , let us briefly summarize the numerical procedure employed to find the ground state wave function of a dipolar condensate .",
    "for a given set of control parameters @xmath47 , we first determine the proper values of @xmath39 and @xmath48 .",
    "then , using eq .",
    "( [ cylcut ] ) , we numerically compute the fourier transform of the modified dipolar interaction potential eq .",
    "( [ cylcut ] ) . finally , following the standard procedure for imaginary time evolution , we obtain the ground state wave function .",
    "in this section , we shall first map out the stability diagram of a trapped dipolar condensate in the parameter space ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the value of the trap aspect ratio @xmath16 ranges from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , which covers both highly prolate and oblate trap geometries . for given parameters @xmath16 and @xmath26 ,",
    "increasing the repulsive contact interaction will stabilize the condensate , we therefore manually set an upper limit on @xmath25 such that @xmath52 .",
    "the lower limit of @xmath25 , on the other hand , is introduced naturally as the system always becomes unstable by tuning the contact interaction to attractive with sufficiently large strength .",
    "similarly , the lower and upper limits of the dipolar interaction strength are also determined by the stability of the condensate . in the second part of this section , we turn to study the free expansion dynamics of an initially trapped dipolar condensate , aiming at finding signatures of the density oscillation in time - of - flight image .     of the condensate in the presence of density oscillation for @xmath53 ( a ) and @xmath54 ( b).,width=307 ]      in previous numerical studies  @xcite ,",
    "the stability diagram is plotted in @xmath16-@xmath26 parameter plane for a given contact interaction strength @xmath25 ( which is usually taken to be zero ) . here , for a fixed trap aspect ratio @xmath16",
    ", we map out the stability diagram in @xmath25-@xmath26 parameter plane .",
    "as we shall show below , this scheme makes it more convenient for us to understand the behavior of the density oscillation in a trapped dipolar condensate .",
    "figure  [ cril01 ] plots the stability diagram in @xmath25-@xmath26 parameter plane of a dipolar condensate in a spherical trap , which also represents the basic structure of the stability in other trap geometries .",
    "since the dipolar force is partially attractive , a condensate always becomes unstable as one increases the absolute value of @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , for given @xmath25 and @xmath16 , there exist two critical dipolar interaction strengths , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , such that the condensate is stable only if @xmath57 . alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath26 is fixed , the instability can also be induced by decreasing the scattering length ( even to negative ) , similar to what have been done experimentally  @xcite .",
    "moreover , when @xmath25 ( @xmath58 ) is so large that the system falls into the thomas - fermi regime , the variational calculation shows that the stability boundary for given @xmath16 only depends on the ratio of @xmath26 and @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "this properties is clearly reflected in fig .",
    "[ cril01 ] , as for @xmath59 , the critical @xmath26 values linearly depend on @xmath25 with slopes @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the reason that the absolute value of @xmath64 is larger than @xmath65 is because , for spherical traps , the dipolar force with negative @xmath26 is more  attractive \" than that with positive @xmath26 .",
    "in general , the stability boundaries should depend on the trap aspect ratio @xmath16 .",
    "however , we find that , for positive ( negative ) @xmath26 in prolate ( oblate ) trap , the critical dipolar interaction strength is roughly independent of the trap geometry , i.e. , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , under these conditions , the condensate shrinks as the dipolar interaction strength grows , such that it only occupies a small spatial volume near the stability boundary .",
    "therefore , the critical dipolar interaction strength becomes insensitive to @xmath16 .",
    "for this reason , we shall focus on the upper stability boundary ( @xmath62 ) for oblate traps and the lower stability boundary ( @xmath63 ) for prolate traps .    ) with fitting parameters listed in tab .",
    "[ tabl].,width=259 ]    .the values of fitting parameters for the positions of dois .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ crioblate ] , we summarize the main results for the stability diagrams in oblate traps .",
    "density oscillations occur when the interaction parameters fall into the shaded areas , namely , the condensate has a biconcave density profile in oblate trap .",
    "the origin of the density oscillation can be intuitively understood as follows : the long - ranged dipolar interaction is repulsive in @xmath68-plane , therefore , when the dipolar force exceeds certain threshold value the density at the center of the trap is depleted to lower the total energy . on the other hand , as one increases the dipolar interaction strength @xmath26 , the attractive dipolar interaction along @xmath12-axis also becomes stronger , which destablizes the system . in a slightly oblate trap ,",
    "the system becomes unstable before such threshold dipolar force required to from the density oscillation is reached .",
    "therefore , for @xmath69 , we do not find any density oscillation in condensate wave function for @xmath25 up to @xmath70 . to get a better understanding of the density oscillation , we plot , in fig .",
    "[ effpot ] ( a ) , the effective potential of the system @xmath71 apparently , when density oscillation occurs in pancake - shaped traps , the effective potential takes a shape of mexican hat .     for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "the solid , dashed , and dash - dotted lines correspond to , respectively , the kinetic , contact interaction , and dipolar interaction energies .",
    "the shaded area marks the range of the interaction parameters where the density oscillation appears.,width=240 ]    the first density oscillations island ( denoted as doi-1 ) appears when @xmath75 .",
    "the shape of the doi clearly indicates that the stability of the system is slightly increased by forming density oscillation in condensate , and away from doi , the @xmath76 roughly linearly depends on @xmath25 .",
    "as we increase @xmath16 , doi-1 moves along the stability boundary to negative direction of the @xmath25-axis .",
    "in addition , the area of doi-1 shrinks . for even larger",
    "@xmath16 , the second ( doi-2 ) and third ( doi-3 ) density oscillation regions appear .",
    "they also move along the stability boundary by following the similar pattern as doi-1 when the trap aspect ration is increased .",
    "a doi can be roughly characterized using the contact interaction strength : the range of @xmath25 parameter covered by the doi , @xmath77 , represents its width ; while the @xmath25 value at the center of this range , @xmath78 , is the position of the doi .",
    "figure  [ center ] shows the trap aspect ratio dependence of the positions of the three dois ; the corresponding width is plotted as error bar .",
    "one immediately notes that the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath78 can be fitted using equation @xmath79 where the values of the fitting parameters @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 for different dois are listed in tab .",
    "[ tabl ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ center ] , the fitted curves agree very well with the numerical results for all dois .",
    "moreover , the values of the fitting parameter @xmath82 also suggest that increasing @xmath16 will eventually pushes all three dois to the region with @xmath83 . for large @xmath16 ,",
    "all three dois are squeezed into a small region of @xmath25 value , but they remain disconnected .",
    "we point out that even though eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) can not explain why the dois appear under those contact interaction strengths , it can be used to predict the position of dois .",
    "once the position and width of a doi is known , one may access the doi by simply increasing the strength of dipolar interaction strength to the value close to the critical value . in fig .",
    "[ energy ] ( a ) , we present the typical @xmath26 dependences of the energies per particle .",
    "one immediately notices that the energies vary smoothly as the system enters the doi , indicating that condensates with and without density oscillation can not be distinguished from each other by measuring the release energy . as shown in fig .",
    "[ energy ] ( b ) , for fixed @xmath26 , one may also enters the doi by lowering the contact interaction strength .",
    "again , the energies are smooth functions of @xmath25 across the boundary of a doi .     for a condensate in cigar - shaped traps .",
    "the shaded areas mark the dois .",
    "the inset shows the typical result for the isodensity surface of the condensate .",
    "the broken arrows denote the direction to which the dois move as @xmath16 is decreased.,width=259 ]    the stability diagram of a dipolar condensate in cigar - shaped traps is presented in fig .",
    "[ cricigar ] , where the dois appear when @xmath84 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath85 case , the dipolar interaction becomes repulsive ( attractive ) along axial ( radial ) direction for @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , along @xmath12 direction , the repulsive dipolar force depletes the density at the center of the trap such that the isodensity surface of the condensate with density oscillation takes dumbbell - shaped form . corresponding to dumbbell structure , the effective potential [ fig .",
    "[ effpot ] ( b ) ] takes the form of a double - well potential . as the trapping potential becomes more pancake - shaped , the dois move along the stability boundary to the negative direction of the @xmath25-axis ; in addition , the area of the doi shrinks .",
    "we remark that our results do not rule out the possibility that there might exist more dois for larger @xmath25 values , since our numerical calculations have only covered limited ranges of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath25 .",
    "now we turn to study the expansion of an initially trapped dipolar condensates .",
    "compared the contact interaction , the anisotropic nature of the dipolar interaction makes the expanded cloud behave quite differently  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been used experimentally as a diagnostic tool for the detection the dipolar effects in bose - einstein condensate  @xcite .",

    "( [ gp3d ] ) with @xmath92 .",
    "if the interactions are ignored completely during expansion , the condensate will expand ballistically such that the time - of - flight image represents the momentum distribution of the trapped condensate . from the fourier transform of the initial wave function with density oscillation",
    ", one can easily deduce that two side peaks would appear in the time - of - flight image , which can be used as the signature of the density oscillation in the initial condensate .    to demonstrate this",

    "we only switch off the contact interaction for @xmath93 .",
    "figure  [ expcigar ] shows the column densities of the expanded cloud , i.e. , @xmath94 due to the density oscillation , the initial column density has two peaks , in analog to that of the condensate trapped in a double - well potential .",
    "after the condensate expands such that these two peaks overlap , the third peak appears as a result of the interference . at time @xmath95 , three peaks have roughly the same height .",
    "when the system evolves continuously , the heights of the two side peaks become lower and lower , but they are still visible at @xmath96 . however , if the contact interaction remains unchanged during free expansion , the above scenario will be spoiled such that the side peaks vanish very quickly for a cigar - shaped condensate .     ( a ) ,",

    "it can be seen that , even for @xmath101 , the side peaks are still distinguishable from the column density , indicating that the time - of - flight image may be used to detect the density oscillation in a dipolar condensate .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss the density oscillations of a dipolar condensate trapped in a box potential . specifically , we consider a potential which is harmonic along the @xmath12-axis with frequency @xmath102 , but is represented by infinite square wells with length @xmath103 along the @xmath98- and @xmath104-axis .",

    ", there exists an critical dipolar interaction strength beyond which the system will collapse .",
    "however , a rather significant difference here is the much enlarged region of density oscillation .",
    "in fact , here there is no disconnected dois and density oscillation dominates a major portion of the parameter space .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ boxf ] exhibits a typical density plot of a condensate trapped in such a potential .",
    "one can easily see the pronounced density oscillations near the walls .    that a hard wall induces density oscillations in dipolar condensate can be understood from the roton excitation of the system @xcite . here",
    "the effect of the wall is not unlike a vortex line @xcite or a localized repulsive potential @xcite : they all create a local superfluid density depression , in the vicinity of which the roton mode becomes soft and manifests itself as density oscillations @xcite . the same physics also underlies the predicted density ripples in superfluid helium near a boundary @xcite or a vortex line @xcite .    from this study , one can conclude that density oscillations in dipolar condensates can be very easily induced by a rigid wall .",

    "to conclude , we have systematically investigated the density oscillations in trapped dipolar condensates by mapping out the stability diagram of the system on @xmath25-@xmath26 parameter plane .",
