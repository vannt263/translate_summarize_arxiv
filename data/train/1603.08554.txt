    "quantum annealing ( qa ) is an an approach to solving optimisation problems , a family of tasks that include many important examples ranging from financial portfolio management to vehicle routing  @xcite .",
    "typically the task can be thought of as minimising a _ cost function _ that depends upon many variables . in qa",
    "this is done by considering a physical system whose energy corresponds to the cost , and seeking that system s ground state .",
    "one can implement the qa approach using conventional hardware by running an algorithm that mimics quantum behaviour  @xcite ; this is then a variant of classical simulated annealing  @xcite .",
    "alternatively one can aim to construct real quantum technologies whose components are indeed quantum entities capable of superposition and entanglement .",
    "the annealing process can exploit the adiabatic theorem in order to remain in , or near , the system s ground state when changing parameters ( such as a global field ) sufficiently slowly . by starting from a hamiltonian",
    "whose ground state can be reliably achieved , and morphing slowly to a final hamiltonian whose energies reflect the cost in the optimisation problem , the hope is that measuring the final state reveals a low cost solution .",
    "there are many interesting questions associated with this approach .",
    "the prospects of reaching the ground state of the final hamiltonian will depend on rate at which the hamiltonian is changed versus the size of the _ gap _ from ground state to lowest excited states ; the smaller the gap , the slower the evolution must be @xcite .",
    "however since the gap size can not be pre - computed for problems of meaningful size , it is difficult to be definite about how fast the system can be permitted to evolve , or indeed whether the approach can succeed at all given finite temperatures .",
    "thus the performance of a qa system is hard to predict analytically .",
    "prototype systems do exist from the company d - wave , and several studies have sought to evaluate the power of these systems by empirical testing ( see e.g. ref .",
    "one can also make comparisons with qa simulated by quantum monte carlo , although this must be done with caution as there are subtleties with the discretisation of time @xcite .",
    "another important question is that of connectivity .",
    "in contrast to conventional computers , and indeed circuit model quantum computers , the adiabatic approach involves keeping interactions between qubits `` always - on '' so as to maintain the energy gap .",
    "this implies that the qubits , or _ spins _ as we will henceforth refer to them , should maintain direct physical interactions continuously .",
    "whereas ideally one might wish to be able to connect any physical spin in the device to any other , in practice this is inconsistent with interactions which are implemented through short range physical links . in the d - wave chips , the set of permitted non - zero links between the physical spins",
    "is called chimera graph ( see ref .",
    "it is locally rich , but on the large scale it has the form of a two dimensional nearest - neighbour lattice .",
    "typically for a real - world optimisation problem , such as the satisfiability problems @xcite , one would not expect that the variables are tensioned against each other in a pattern that respects any particular geometry .",
    "therefore for the _ logical problem _ to be realised as a physical annealing task , it must in some way be re - expressed .",
    "one solution is based on minor embedding @xcite : in effect groups of physical spins are bound together with very strong interactions in order to form extended single spin entities .",
    "these larger entities have correspondingly more connections to one another . in order to achieve all - to - all connectivity in this way",
    ", the @xmath0 spins of the logical problem must be encoded into order(@xmath4 ) physical spins . however , even assuming that this cost is permissible ( and one should expect that the increased number of physical spins corresponds to a reduction in the crucial energy gap ) , there is a question as to whether this approach is practical .",
    "when a large number of physical spins are bound together with achievable interaction strengths , it is not clear that the extended objects will indeed function as equivalent to single logical spins .",
    "an alternative formulation of the mapping was recently proposed by lechner , hauke and zoller ( lhz ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to this approach",
    ", the physical spins now represent the links , or relative orientations , between the logical spins .",
    "thus there is one _ physical _ spin whose role is to represent the relative orientation of _ logical _ spins 1 and 2 : if they are aligned ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) then the physical spin will take one value ( @xmath7 , say ) , whereas if the logical spins are anti - aligned ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) then the physical spin takes the opposite orientation ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "since there are @xmath11 possible pairings of the @xmath0 logical spins this leads to the same order(@xmath4 ) resource cost as the minor embedding approach ; however one avoids the need to bind multiple physical spins into single entities , and indeed the coupling strengths in the logical model conveniently map to single - spin energies in the physical hardware . _",
    "note added in late draft : a paper by albash , vinci , and lidar has very recently been posted , which makes a detailed comparison of minor embedding versus the lhz approach , see ref .",
    "_    here we view the lhz approach within the general framework of a set of stabilisers , which allows us to recover the lhz construction as well as a wide variety of variations .",
    "each stabiliser is a product of physical @xmath12 operators which we constrain to one of its eigenvalues , either @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "this can be viewed as a restriction to either even , or odd , parity .",
    "the original lhz construction corresponds to all - even stabilisers ; we find there there may be some advantages to switching to all - odd constraints instead ; the required ancilla structure is more simple and moreover our simple numerical simulations indicate that level crossings are less frequent .",
    "in addition to the square lattice of the lhz proposal , our stabiliser formulation leads us to a number of interesting alternatives .",
    "if all - to - all connectivity is required , then triangular ( three - body ) stabilisers can replace the four - body stabilisers of lhz . moreover",
    "if a lower level of connectivity will suffice then our approach can provide layouts involving fewer physical spins .",
    "note that some np problems , like graph colouring , are hard to solve ( or indeed , _ hardest _ to solve ) when they do nt have a fully connected graph  @xcite .",
    "we give examples where @xmath15 and @xmath3 physical spins realise non - trivial connectivities between @xmath0 logical spins .",
    "additionally , we show how arbitrarily high order terms in the logical hamiltonian ( such as @xmath16 ) can be mapped to a single spin in the physical layout .",
    "our approach is conceptually straightforward .",
    "we take a candidate layout of @xmath17 physical spins , and we specify @xmath18 stabiliser constraints .",
    "we then nominate @xmath0 of the physical spins , each of which will correspond to a logical spins in the following sense : the @xmath12-operator a physical spin is identified with the same operator on the logical spin .",
    "finally we identify the logical @xmath19-operators that are implied by these earlier choices ; each will be a product of operators forming a chain that crosses the layout , rather analogously to logical operators in topological codes such as the kitaev s surface code @xcite .",
    "intersections between these logical @xmath19 chains allow us to find the meaning of each individual physical spin , i.e. to identify what product of logical @xmath12 spins it represents .",
    "we define the _ logical _ spin glass model , in which each spin can have a non - zero interaction with every other as well as an arbitrary local field , as follows @xmath20 note this hamiltonian is general in the sense that the local fields @xmath21 and the interaction strengths @xmath22 can take any value .",
    "however it does not contain three - body or higher interaction terms , which would be convenient for optimising functions containing terms with three or more variables involved .",
    "in fact , in the final part of the analysis presented here we will extend our considerations to logical hamiltonians that _ do _ contain arbitrary higher order terms .",
    "for simplicity we will now focus on the case where the logical hamiltonian has the form above .",
    "the task now is to successfully emulate the physics of this ideal , logical hamiltonian using a real architecture in which a larger number of physical spins interact only locally .",
    "we begin by selecting a layout for the physical spins ; our first choice will be the two - dimensional lattice with a square unit cell as proposed by lhz ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : squarelattice ] ) .",
    "this structure contains @xmath23 physical spins , therefore its full hilbert space is vastly greater than that of the logical hamiltonian : we must apply constraints to define a suitable subspace .",
    "we will specify a set of mutually - commuting _",
    "stabilisers _ , each being a operator formed by a product of single - spin pauli operators .",
    "we will require that the state of the system is a mutual eigenstate of all these stabilisers with a specified eigenvalue in each case : either @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "( note this is a slight departure from the usual convention where all stabiliser eigenvalues are @xmath13 because any negative value is absorbed into the definition of the stabiliser itself ) . as we enforce each such stabiliser",
    ", we will halve the dimension of the compatible hilbert space .",
    "therefore we will require @xmath24 stabilisers in order that the compliant subspace has the desired dimension @xmath25 .",
    "our remaining task will be to identify observables in the physical lattice that correspond to the measurement of single spins in the logical hamiltonian , and establish the conditions under which the correspondence is correct .        as noted , the physical layout is a lattice of square cells forming a triangular shape as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : squarelattice ] .",
    "there are @xmath23 spins .",
    "presently , we will introduce additional ancilla spins whose role is simply to enforce the stabiliser constraints in a physically natural way ",
    "but when we allude to _ physical spins _ without explicitly using the term _ ancilla _ then we are referring to the @xmath23 spins that form the direct physical embodiment .",
    "we label each physical spin with two coordinates @xmath26 and each face according to the spin at the top corner , e.g.  the top face is labelled as @xmath27 $ ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : squarelattice ] .",
    "the reason for this labelling will become apparent ; for now is it simply a systematic way to uniquely tag each spin .    in order that",
    "this formulation is consistent with the lhz approach , we select a family of stabilisers that can constrain the parity of the physical spins around each face of the lattice .",
    "face @xmath28 $ ] corresponds to a stabiliser @xmath29 } = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } { \\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{z}}_{(i , j)}}{\\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{z}}_{(i , j-1)}}{\\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{z}}_{(i+1,j)}}{\\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{z}}_{(i+1,j-1 ) } } , & \\mbox{if $ i+2 < j$;\\ \\ \\ } \\\\ { \\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{z}}_{(i , j)}}{\\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{z}}_{(i , j-1)}}{\\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{z}}_{(i+1,j ) } } , & \\mbox{if $ i+2 = j$.\\ \\ \\ \\ } \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second case @xmath30 simply corresponds to the triangular faces along the base of the lattice .",
    "the tilde symbol is used to indicate that the sigma operators @xmath31 apply to physical spins .",
    "each stabiliser is thus the product of pauli operators acting on the physical spins around the face .",
    "since each pauli operator has eigenvalues @xmath32 corresponding to its spin being orientated in the positive / negative @xmath12-direction , it follows that the stabiliser s eigenvalues are @xmath32 .",
    "this value can be interpreted as a parity if we take @xmath13 to indicate ` even ' and @xmath14 to indicate ` odd ' in terms of the the number of spins aligned along negative @xmath12-direction .",
    "this odd / even label is natural for four - body stabilisers , but can be less intuitive for other stabilisers  therefore we will use the term odd / even only for the four - body case , and more generally we will speak of positive and negative stabilisers .",
    "we will require that the states of interest @xmath33 are good eigenstates of _ all _ these stabilisers , i.e. @xmath34 } { \\vert { l } \\rangle}=\\nu_{i , j}{\\vert { l } \\rangle},\\ ] ] where we will specify each individual @xmath35 as @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "equivalently , writing @xmath36 as the projector into the legitimate subspace , we require @xmath37 } p_0=\\nu_{i , j}p_0 $ ] . we easily verify that this set of stabilisers mutually commute ( all are @xmath12-basis operators ) and moreover they are independent : specifying the eigenvalues of any subset does not constrain the eigenvalues of the remaining ones .",
    "this latter property is confirmed by noting that as we consider each new face of the lattice , we are encountering at least one new qubit .",
    "( note that in contrast , the 2d toric stabiliser code has the feature that specifying all - but - one of the stabilisers in a given basis will logically imply the value of the last one ) .",
    "it is worth remarking that the legitimate states of the physical spins are formally _ stabiliser states _ if we opt to absorb the @xmath35 factors into the stabilisers ; but we find it convenient to regard the stabilisers as fixed entities and the @xmath35 as their required eigenvalues .    it remains to identify observable properties of the physical lattice which will correspond to the single - spin operators @xmath38 ( and @xmath39 ) in the logical hamiltonian .",
    "we call these the _ logical spin operators_. we will simply choose one set , the @xmath38 set , and then attempt to identify the appropriate @xmath39 .",
    "remaining consistent with the lhz construction , we assign our logical @xmath40 operators to the individual physical spins on the left - side diagonal , i.e. @xmath41 clearly these logical operators commute both with one another and with the stabilises ( all are @xmath12-basis ) and they are independent from one another and from the stabilisers ( specifying the states of these logical observables would not constrain any of the stabiliser eigenvalues ) .",
    "therefore this choice is valid . with this choice",
    ", one can of course read the state of logical spins in the @xmath12-basis by measuring physical spins on the left side of the lattice .",
    "we must now identify the logical spin @xmath19 operators with the same properties of commutation and independence , except that of course that the @xmath12 and @xmath19 operators for the same logical qubit should anti - commute .",
    "no set of operators on single physical spins will have this property ; instead we should look for products of physical spin operators .",
    "consider the logical @xmath19-operator for logical spin @xmath42 .",
    "since it must anti - commute with logical operator @xmath43 we include @xmath44 in the product of operators .",
    "however , it should commute will all our earlier stabilisers , so it should include zero , two or four @xmath44operators around each face of the lattice ( i.e. each stabiliser ) . finally , it should not include @xmath45 for any @xmath46 or else it will not commute with those other logical spins .",
    "considering these constraints , we are led to the unique solution : a product of @xmath47 operators along the path indicated in red in fig .",
    "[ fig : squarelattice ] .",
    "the other logical @xmath19-operators have analogous forms , descending from the left side and ` bouncing ' from the base as shown in the upper left inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : squarelattice ] .",
    "formally , @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "that is , the logical @xmath50 operator is the product of pauli operators of the set of physical spins with a label either @xmath51 or @xmath52 .    at this point",
    "we are ready to re - write the original logical spin hamiltonian in terms of operators on the physical lattice .",
    "each term of the form @xmath53 simply translates to @xmath54 .",
    "meanwhile , each term @xmath55 translates directly to @xmath56 but crucially this can be rewritten as a single physical spin operator @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a certain product of our @xmath59 eigenvalues . to see this ,",
    "consider first the physical spin at @xmath60 , and moreover the value of operator @xmath61 . for all legitimate states , @xmath62}{\\vert { l } \\rangle}=\\nu_{0,2}{\\vert { l } \\rangle}$ ] .",
    "but @xmath62}$ ] is defined as @xmath63 , and the first two of these operators are logical @xmath40 operators and therefore must be free to take any value , i.e. we can make no constraint on @xmath64 , @xmath65 or their product .",
    "then , in order to ensure that @xmath62}{\\vert { l } \\rangle}=\\nu_{0,2}{\\vert { l } \\rangle}$ ] we must insist that @xmath66 .",
    "thus the physical spin at @xmath60 is entirely dependent on the physical spins at @xmath67 and @xmath68 , in such a way as to satisfy the face stabiliser .",
    "consequently for the legitimate subspace we can rewrite the term @xmath69 as @xmath70 .",
    "having thus established the dependent nature of the physical spin at @xmath60 , one can repeat the argument for the physical spin at @xmath71 : the face stabiliser @xmath72 $ ] involves two logical spins , and the spin whose dependence we have just determined , thus the dependence of the fourth spin is implied .",
    "we find that in order to ensure @xmath73}{\\vert { l } \\rangle}=\\nu_{0,3}{\\vert { l } \\rangle}$ ] , we will require @xmath74 .",
    "one can proceed to establish the dependence of every remaining physical spin ; it is always of the form @xmath75 where @xmath58 is simply a certain product of our chosen stabiliser eigenvalues : @xmath76 in general this is the product of the @xmath77 values in a block of the array ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : squarelattice ] the green block corresponds to the set of @xmath77 values that must be multiplied to find @xmath78 .",
    "now since we chose to identify @xmath79 with the logical @xmath12-operator @xmath38 , we can now conclude that each spin @xmath26 encodes the logical product @xmath80 ( up to the sign @xmath58 ) .",
    "thus the motivation for our labelling scheme is apparent .",
    "we note from the fig .",
    "[ fig : squarelattice](a ) inset that physical spin @xmath26 also lies at the interaction of the logical @xmath19-operator chains for logical spins @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in a later section",
    "we will show that this is generally the case , for any lattice : if the logical @xmath19-operator for logical spin @xmath81 intersects with a given physical spin , then @xmath38 is in the product of logical @xmath12-operators to which that spin s physical @xmath12-operator @xmath79 corresponds .",
    "this is a more efficient way to identify the roles of physical spins , rather than the step - by - step construction described in the previous paragraph .",
    "we can now conclude that the original logical spin system is realised in a subspace of the physical hamiltonian , @xmath83 here @xmath84 encapsulates the physics that forces the physical spins to respect the stabiliser constraints .",
    "we see that if we make the choice @xmath85 for all @xmath86 then we recover exactly the physical prescription proposed by lhz .",
    "the constraint hamiltonian can always be expressed as @xmath87 here , @xmath88 are eigenenergies and @xmath89 are projectors corresponding to eigenstates of @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath90 is the ground energy , and @xmath36 corresponds to the ground - state subspace of @xmath84 .    if @xmath84 satisfies the following conditions , logical spins are in the ground state of @xmath91 ( the logical model ) when physical spins are in the ground state of @xmath92 :    * @xmath93 = 0 $ ] ; * @xmath94 : s_{[i , j]}p_0 = \\nu_{i , j}p_0 $ ] and @xmath95 ; * @xmath96 = [ p_0 , u_{k}{\\sigma^{\\mathrm{x}}_{k}}v_{k } ] = [ u_{k } , { \\sigma^{\\mathrm{z}}_{k ' } } ] = [ v_{k } , { \\sigma^{\\mathrm{z}}_{k ' } } ] = 0 $ ] , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are unitary operators ; * and @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the ground state energy of @xmath91 , @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) is the lowest eigenenergy of @xmath92 in the subspace @xmath103 ( @xmath36 ) , and @xmath104 is the identity operator .    the proof is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conditions ] .",
    "the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state in the physical model is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the energy gap in the logical model .    obviously , one way to write down a suitable constraint hamiltonian is simply to use the stabilisers themselves .",
    "for example if we choose @xmath85 , @xmath107 which corresponds to the approach in ref .",

    "however , a hamiltonian formed by stabilisers involves three - body and four - body interactions , which are unphysical .",
    "the use of ancilla qutrits to achieve an equivalent but physically realistic @xmath84 is discussed further in the next section .",
    "making other choices for the stabiliser values @xmath35 can lead to interesting variants .",
    "consider , for example , the choice @xmath114 for all @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this means that each local stabiliser is requiring odd parity among its group of physical spins .",

    "[ fig : squarelattice](b ) . thus these particular @xmath22 couplings from the original , logical hamiltonian",
    "are multiplied by @xmath14 in the physical hamiltonian .",
    "presumably this will not present difficulties for any relevant hardware system , since such a system will need to handle both positive and negative @xmath118 values in any case in order to tackle non - trivial computation problems .",
    "but there is a more profound consequence for the hardware implementation : all our stabilisers now seek to constrain their local groups of spins to odd parities , and this may be easier to realise than the even parity constraint . formally , a suitable @xmath84 can be written in analogous terms to eqn .",
    "( [ formalhc ] ) as @xmath119 } ( { \\openone}+ s_{[i , j]})$ ] , but again this is using unphysical 3 and 4 body terms .",
    "the interesting distinction is that there is now a natural way to an equivalent @xmath84 using only a single ancilla qubit for each stabiliser group , as we now discuss .",
    "summarising the paper so far , the previous section introduced a stabiliser formalism and used it to map a hamiltonian with @xmath0 _ logical _ spins posessing ` all - to - all ' interactions , to a physical hamiltonian with @xmath23 physical spins but requiring only local interactions .",

    "[ fig : squarelattice](a ) . ]",
    "so far we have used our stabiliser formalism only to recover the proposal of lhz , with an additional freedom to choose odd versus even parity constraints .",
    "but the stabiliser picture can allow us to design a wide range of physical layouts , in order to realise different levels of connectivity and/or higher order correlations than two - body .    before varying the nature of the logical hamiltonian",
    ", we note that our approach can guide us to layouts which support exactly the same logical hamintoan as the lhz construction , but which have different kinds of stabiliser ( rather than merely different stabiliser _ signs _ , as considered earlier ) .",
    "perhaps the most simple set of stabilisers is the triangular pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangular](a ) . when finding sets of stabilisers such as these , it is helpful to remember the principle that any product of stabilisers is also a stabiliser .",
    "this can allow one to translate from stabilisers that are non - local in the physical layout , to a local set .",
    "for example , the product of the three stabilisers within the large blue dashed triangle , is equivalent to stabiliser @xmath175 which involves only the spins at the corners of that triangle ( because each spin in the middle of an edge appears twice in the product , so cancelling out ) .",
    "this layout , or others generated using the same principles , may prove more natural to implement with a given technology .",
    "we now generalise away from hamiltonians that require all - to - all connectivity , but for the moment we will continue to restrict our logical hamiltonians to involve only one- and two - body terms .",
    "we therefore consider a connectivity graph with vertices @xmath176 , representing the logical spins , and edges @xmath177 representing the required terms in the logical hamiltonian eqn .",

    "we need only follow our earlier prescription : we select @xmath0 of the physical spins to represent the logical @xmath12-operators , i.e. we identify the physical spins @xmath173 for whom @xmath183 is identified with @xmath38 .",
    "we then define @xmath184 independent stabilisers , as before specifying each stabiliser as a product of @xmath131 operators .",
    "finally we determine the logical @xmath19-operators that are implied by these choices , recalling the requirements : operator @xmath39 must commute with all other logical @xmath19-operators and with all the stabilisers , and it must commute with all @xmath185 while anti - commuting with @xmath38 . as before , this leads us to the rule that the product of physical @xmath186 operators which constitutes a given logical @xmath19-operator @xmath39 must ( a ) include @xmath187 , ( b ) exclude all @xmath188 and ( c ) include an even number ( or zero ) of operators that address spins in each stabiliser .",
    "assuming that all logical @xmath19-operators have been identified , we can now identify the roles of the remaining physical spins using the following rule : the physical spin where logical @xmath19-operators @xmath39 and @xmath189 intersect , is to be labelled @xmath26 .",
    "this spin s physical @xmath12-operator @xmath190 is identical to the logical two - body term @xmath80 , up to a sign @xmath58 .",
    "the sign is simply a function of which stabilisers we have chosen to be negative , as in the example leading to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : murule ] . in an earlier section we alluded to this convenient rule , and we now justify it .    taken together the logical @xmath191 operators and the stabilisers form a total of @xmath179 independent operators , each of which is either a physical operator @xmath131 or a product of such operators . from their independence",
    "it follows that we must be able to express any operator @xmath192 as a product of logical operators and stabilisers , i.e.   @xmath193 we can determine which logical @xmath191 operators are in this product by considering logical @xmath194 operators . if @xmath195 is in the product , @xmath192 anti - commutes with @xmath50 , otherwise @xmath192 commutes with @xmath50 .",
    "but from our definition of the logical @xmath19 operators , only @xmath39 and @xmath189 anti - commute with @xmath192 so we conclude that only @xmath38 and @xmath196 are in the product , i.e.   @xmath197 therefore , the ising interaction @xmath198 in the logical model can be mapped to @xmath199 in the physical model ( up to a sign determined by the value of stabilisers ) .        in practice",
    "this means that if we wish to have a physical spin representing a two - body term @xmath80 in the logical hamiltonian , i.e. if that edge exists in @xmath177 , then the lines of physical spins associated with the two logical @xmath19-operators must cross .",
    "this provides a design principle to create a bespoke physical array to represent a given logical hamiltonian .",

    "figure  [ fig : moreexamples](a ) and ( b ) provide further examples of interesting bespoke layouts .",
    "the layout in ( a)(i ) is a simple pattern with a logical connectivity graph such that vertices ( i.e. logical spins ) numbers @xmath200 to @xmath201 are connected to all other vertices , while vertices @xmath202 and higher do not interconnect among themselves .",
    "an interesting variant occurs if we remove one physical spin , and correspondingly reduce the stabiliser count by one , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : moreexamples](a)(ii ) .",
    "note a central group of four square stabilisers has been replaced with two triangular stabilisers and a single hexagonal stabiliser .",
    "( as an aside we note that a suitable six - body , negative - parity stabiliser can be realised using only two ancilla qubits , see appendix  [ sec : ancillaconstructions ] ) the effect of this central disruption to the layout is to effectively ` reflect ' the logical @xmath19-operator chains that would have passed though it .",
    "this alters the logical connectivity graph , for example logical spin number @xmath134 now only connects to @xmath203 .",
    "interestingly there are now two physical spins for each of the labels @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "this does not present an in - principle difficulty when translating from the logical hamiltonian to the local fields on the physical spins , we simply need to ensure that the total field on the two spins labelled @xmath204 is equal to the factor @xmath207 in the logical hamiltonian , and similarly for the others .    the ` reflecting ' stabiliser in fig .",
    "[ fig : squarelattice](a)(ii ) can be used repeatedly within a larger lattice in order to control the interactions between logical @xmath19-operators , and thus define the logical connectivity graph .",

    "the layout realises a rather complex connectivity graph in which there are a small number of highly connected vertices , a larger number of more modestly connected nodes , and so on .",

    "with these @xmath209 spins one could engineer a hierarchy where one logical spin connects to all others , two connect to 50% of the set , four connect to 25% , and so on .",
    "finally we consider how the stabiliser picture presented here generalises to support terms in the logical hamiltonian that are higher than two - body .",
    "previously we noted that when two logical @xmath19-operators @xmath81 and @xmath82 intersect , the physical spin at the intersection necessarily represents the two - body logical operator @xmath80 .",
    "however , it is possible for multiple logical operators to intersect at a specific physical spin , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : squarelattice](c ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : squarelattice](d ) provides a second illustration of how higher order terms can be introduced .",
    "the figures shows a region of a the standard lhz layout , i.e. a larger version of the pattern shown in fig .",

    "here there are three additional physical spins ( green circles ) and correspondingly three additional stabilisers ( grey shaded regions ) .",
    "each of the new physical spins provides a high order logical correlation , as specified in the caption .",
    "in is interesting to note that the ideas presented here could potentially be used _ in addition _ to the principle of minor embedding , rather than replacing that approach outright .",
    "starting from the original logical hamiltonian , which directly corresponds to the structure of some computational task , one might use the minor embedding principle to derive a second , intermediate logical hamiltonian with a larger number of spins .",
    "this intermediate hamiltonian could then be translated into a stabiliser based layout as described here .",
    "the potential benefit would be an increased flexibility in the connectivity offered by a given layout pattern .",
    "we began by presenting a stabiliser formulation for the problem of mapping a hamiltonian with @xmath0 ` all - to - all ' interacting spins , to a hamiltonian of @xmath23 spins with only local interactions .",
    "as a first illustration of the approach , we took the recent work of lechner , hauke and zoller , and adopted their physical spin layout .",
    "we noted the resulting logical @xmath12 and logical @xmath19 operators ; the latter are chains of operators that traverse the lattice ( as occurs in topological error correcting codes ) .",
    "we recover the lhz result , and we also identify an interesting variant based on constraining local groups of spins to _ odd parity _ , rather than even parity .",
    "this variant has an attractively simple realisation in terms of pure ising interactions and ancilla qubits ( rather than qutrits ) , and might perhaps be realised through commonly shared resonators .",
    "we numerically verify our results for small systems of @xmath213 logical qubits .",
    "there are some indications that our new odd - parity , qubit - ancilla model may maintain a more reliable energy gap during an anneal .",
    "having thus demonstrated our formalism in an established context , we proceed to show how it can be used to a wide range of different physical spins layouts .",

    "<S> in a recent paper lechner , hauke and zoller ( lhz ) described a means to translate a hamiltonian of @xmath0 spin-@xmath1 particles with ` all - to - all ' interactions into a larger physical lattice with only on - site energies and local parity constraints . </S>",
    "<S> lhz used this mapping to propose a novel form of quantum annealing . here </S>",
    "<S> we provide a stabiliser - based formulation within which we can describe both this prior approach and a wide variety of variants . </S>",
    "<S> examples include a triangular array supporting all - to - all connectivity , and moreover arrangements requiring only @xmath2 or @xmath3 spins but providing interesting bespoke connectivities . </S>",
    "<S> further examples show that arbitrarily high order logical terms can be efficiently realised , even in a strictly 2d layout . </S>",
    "<S> our stabilisers can correspond to either even - parity constraints , as in the lhz proposal , or as odd - parity constraints . </S>",
    "<S> considering the latter option applied to the original lhz layout , we note it may simplify the physical realisation since the required ancillas are only spin-@xmath1 systems ( i.e.  qubits , rather than qutrits ) and moreover the interactions are very simple . </S>",
    "<S> we make a preliminary assessment of the impact of this design choices by simulating small ( few - qubit ) systems ; we find some indications that the new variant may maintain a larger minimum energy gap during the annealing process . </S>"
