    "the current census of white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood is believed to be complete only to about 13 pc , and is measurably incomplete within 20 pc @xcite .",
    "the local sample of white dwarfs appears to be an old population consisting of mostly cool white dwarfs .",
    "the average absolute magnitude for the local census of white dwarfs is @xmath2 which corresponds to a temperature of @xmath3 k. a significant fraction of white dwarfs within 13 pc ( * ? ? ? *",
    "@xmath4 ) show the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "@xcite determined that over a quarter of the white dwarfs within 20 pc are in binary systems .",
    "based on recent literature , we updated the spectral classifications of the sample of white dwarfs within 20 pc @xcite and found that about 70% of the stars are hydrogen - rich .",
    "the remaining 30% are helium - rich , and out of these helium rich white dwarfs about half are dc white dwarfs , about a third are cool dq white dwarfs , while the remainder are dz white dwarfs .",
    "the new luyten two - tenths ( nltt ) catalog has been used to search for nearby cool dwarfs and subdwarfs @xcite and for white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however , a large number of objects still require a formal spectroscopic confirmation . recently",
    ", @xcite have revised the coordinates and proper motions of most stars in the nltt catalog by cross - correlating the catalog with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and the usno - a catalogs .",
    "one problem with the original catalog was that there was no obvious separation between different populations because the r and b photographic bands do not provide a broad enough baseline to distinguish between main - sequence , subdwarf and white dwarf populations .",
    "@xcite showed that using an optical / infrared ( @xmath5 ) reduced proper motion diagram they could distinguish between these groups of stars and from this diagram they listed 23 white dwarf candidates within 20 pc from the sun . @xcite and @xcite found that only a third of these nearby candidates are white dwarfs , with the remainder being cool red dwarfs and subdwarfs .",
    "recently , several projects have been initiated to search for high - proper motion stars , such as the supercosmos - recons survey @xcite and lspm catalog @xcite which utilizes the supercosmos sky survey @xcite and superblink @xcite , respectively .",
    "these surveys have detected many high - proper motion stars which are either nearby or have been labeled as halo candidates .",
    "one such object is the cool white dwarf wd 0346@xmath6246 @xcite , which has definite halo kinematics and is very cool ( @xmath7 k ) and hence old enough to belong to the halo .",
    "a total of 299 new stars with @xmath8 yr@xmath1 have been discovered using the supercosmos - recons survey @xcite , out of which 148 have proper motions greater than @xmath9yr@xmath1 and 43 are within 25 pc from the sun .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of 198 new stars with proper motions greater than @xmath9yr@xmath1 using superblink .",
    "their survey also included the nearby halo white dwarf pm j13420@xmath103415 @xcite .",
    "the nltt catalog appears to be complete at galactic latitudes @xmath11 , however at low galactic latitudes the catalog appears to be significantly incomplete . on the other hand , @xcite notes",
    "that the completeness for white dwarfs is very high , i.e. , the coverage of white dwarfs appears to be completely uniform .",
    "the reason for this may be that luyten concentrated on blue objects , which are no more common in the plane than elsewhere , and hence luyten was able to detect most high - proper motion white dwarfs above @xmath12 . another survey to search for cool white dwarfs with high - proper motion using the guide star catalog ii was initiated by @xcite with the aim of placing constraints on the halo white dwarf space density .",
    "their search resulted in the discovery of 24 new white dwarfs .",
    "many earlier proper motion surveys , in particular the luyten proper motion surveys relied on plate pairs taken a decade or more apart , and very high - proper motion stars were most likely lost in the background .",
    "a search for ultra - high proper motion stars was performed by @xcite using the skymorph database of the near earth asteroid tracking ( neat ) project @xcite and found a main - sequence star with spectral type m6.5 and with a proper motion of @xmath13 at a distance of @xmath14 pc which they obtained from the trigonometric parallax .",
    "since most of the stars in the nltt catalog are brighter than 19th magnitude , we do not expect to find many halo white dwarf candidates .",
    "since the halo star formation history is assumed to be a burst occurring 12 gyrs ago , then most of the halo white dwarfs would be required to have cooling ages greater than 10 gyrs ( and hence @xmath15 ) .",
    "given that the percentage of halo white dwarfs in the local population is @xmath16 @xcite , then most halo candidates are likely to be at large distances and hence too faint to be included in the nltt catalog .    in this paper , we pursue our study of white dwarf candidates @xcite from the revised nltt ( rnltt ) catalog of @xcite .",
    "some preliminary results were presented in @xcite .",
    "we present the list of white dwarfs observed in  2 and their spectroscopic observations in  2.1 with complementary optical and infrared photometric data presented in  2.2 .",
    "the model atmospheres and spectra we used to analyze our data are described in  3 and in  4 we present our analysis of the new white dwarf stars .",
    "we discuss our findings in  5 and summarize in  6 .",
    "table  [ tbl1 ] lists the white dwarf candidates for which we have obtained a spectroscopic identification .",
    "many of the white dwarfs were listed in the luyten white dwarf catalogs ( lwdc ) @xcite , and required spectroscopic confirmation of their classification .",

    "appear to be slightly higher than those determined from spectroscopy for @xmath340 k and vice versa for @xmath341 k. this may be due to measurement errors or possibly to systematic errors in either spectroscopic ( i.e. , via the fitting of balmer lines with model spectra ) or photometric calibration .      table  [ tbl2 ] summarizes the results of the analyses of the white dwarfs .",

    "one of these ( nltt 44986 ) is also an ultramassive white dwarf with a mass of @xmath652 , and another one is a magnetic white dwarf ( nltt 44447 ) with an estimate surface magnetic field of 1.3 mg . in our sample",
    "there is also one cool dq white dwarf ( nltt 31347 ) with an estimated temperature of 5200 k and the cool dz nltt 40607 presented by @xcite .",
    "eight of the white dwarfs have distances that place them within 20 pc of the sun , hence contributing toward the local census .",
    "parallax measurements of the new nearby white dwarfs should be obtained in order to provide independent estimate of their radius and mass .",
    "we determined u , v and w space velocities for all 61 objects .",
    "the means and dispersions of @xmath629 and @xmath195 suggest that these objects belong to the thin disk .",
    "however , due to the overlap of the thick disk population distribution with the thin disk population distribution in the @xmath645 plane , some of the stars in our sample may belong to the thick disk . to help distinguish between thick and thin disk white dwarf populations , the z - component of the angular momentum @xmath653 , the eccentricity of the orbit @xmath654 and the galactic orbit",
    "should be calculated @xcite .",
    "therefore , to obtain full information about the kinematics of the white dwarfs , accurate radial velocity measurements are necessary .",
