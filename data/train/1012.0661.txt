    "magnetic reconnection plays a very important role in solar flares , corona mass ejections , and other solar activities . during the solar minimum ,",
    "many authors focus their attention on the solar small - scale activities such as microflares @xcite , ellerman bombs @xcite , chromospheric jets @xcite , and so on .",
    "microflares , or subflares , or bright points , are small - scale and short - lifetime solar activities .",
    "the size of microflares ranges from several arcsecs to about 20 arcsecs , the duration and the total energy can be @xmath4 minutes and @xmath5 ergs , respectively @xcite .",
    "the most distinctive feature in their visible spectra is the faint emission at the center and the brightening at the wing of some chromospheric lines such as h@xmath6 line .",
    "soft x - ray @xcite , hard x - ray ( hxr * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , euv @xcite and microwave @xcite emissions have also been observed in some microflares .",
    "it is an interesting fact that there are some correlations among the emissions at different wavelengths .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that about 40% of microflares show hxr emissions at @xmath710 kev and microwave emissions at @xmath810 ghz .",
    "recently , @xcite found that there is a correlation between the power - law index of the hxr spectrum and the emission measure of microflares .",
    "@xcite found that the studied microflare is bright first in the chromospheric and transition region spectral lines rather than in the corona , which is consistent with the chromospheric heating by nonthermal electron beams .",
    "all these evidence indicates that microflares are related to the nonthermal processes driven by magnetic reconnection .",
    "some microflares might result from the magnetic reconnection in the corona . however , there is accumulating evidence suggesting that some other microflares are due to the reconnection in the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that in many cases emerging flux occurred about @xmath9 minutes before the microflares , where the emerging flux may collide with the pre - existing magnetic field at the chromospheric height .",
    "@xcite also stated that magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere could be a plausible mechanism for triggering the chromospheric microflare .",
    "@xcite made 2.5-dimensional ( 2.5d ) numerical simulations of chromospheric magnetic reconnection in order to study ellerman bombs and type ii white - light flares .",
    "however , in the simulations , they made some simplifications , such as the omissionof the gravity . in this paper , in order to improve their results , we perform 2.5d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations using the cip - mocct scheme , with gravity being included , and try to make some comparisons with the observations of chromospheric microflares . in the next section ,",
    "the numerical method is given in detail .",
    "our results , which include the dynamic process , parameter dependence , a scaling law and a comparison with a semi - empirical model , are described in section [ numerical results ] .",
    "discussion and summary are given in section [ disc ] .",
    "in our simulation , we solve 2.5d compressible resistive mhd equations with ionization , radiation , and uniform gravitational field being considered .",
    "there is no thermal conduction in our simulation since thermal conductivity is very small in the chromosphere .",
    "the mhd equations are given as follows :    @xmath10    @xmath11 = \\rho \\mathbf{g } \\,\\ , , \\label{mhd-2}\\ ] ]    @xmath12    @xmath13 = \\rho \\mathbf{g } \\cdot \\mathbf{v } + h - r_r \\,\\ , , \\label{mhd-4}\\ ] ]    where eight independent variables are the density ( @xmath14 ) , velocity ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , magnetic field ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , and temperature ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the thermal and ionization terms are included into the total energy density @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the ionization potential of hydrogen atoms and @xmath24 is the vacuum permeability .",
    "considering the helium abundance ( @xmath0 ) , we take @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number density of hydrogen . with partial ionization",
    "considered , the total gas pressure is expressed as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the boltzmann constant and the number density of electrons , @xmath29 , is deduced from the modified saha and boltzmann formula for a pure hydrogen atmosphere @xcite :    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the planck constant .",
    "we take @xmath34 = 6000 k @xcite . in equation ( [ mhd-4 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are the radiative loss and the pre - heating term , respectively .",
    "radiative loss is important in the chromosphere and the photosphere . generally speaking",
    ", it should be calculated by solving simultaneously the statistical equilibrium and radiative transfer equations along with the mhd equations .",
    "however , it is not feasible to deal with it in our 2.5d numerical simulation",
    ". instead , we fit the non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) radiative losses in the valc model for the quiet - sun atmosphere @xcite and the f1 semi - empirical model for the weak flare @xcite , and then modify the empirical formula given by @xcite in order to make it more suitable for the small scale activities such as microflares :    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are functions of @xmath42 ( the height from @xmath43 in the photosphere ) and the temperature @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the unit of @xmath42 is km .",
    "the suitable range of the height and the temperature in equation ( [ rad-1 ] ) is @xmath44 km and @xmath45 k , respectively .",
    "the pre - heating term is given by @xmath46 , which balances the radiative loss before magnetic reconnection .      in order to non - dimensionalize the mhd equations ( [ mhd-1 ] ) - ( [ mhd-4 ] ) in section  [ basic equations ] , the variables are normalized by the quantities given in table  [ normalization units ] . in this table",
    ", @xmath47 is the proton mass . the dimensionless mhd equations , which have a standard form of advection and non - advection terms , are numerically solved with the cip - mocct scheme ( kudoh 1999 ) . besides the acoustic transit time scale @xmath48 used in the nondimensionalization , another practical time scale is the alfvn transit time @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the alfvn velocity at the height of the reconnection x - point . in our simulations , two cases are considered , where the magnetic reconnection x - point is set at two different heights , i.e. , 500 km and 1000 km .",
    "the corresponding alfvn velocities are 18.2 km s@xmath51 and 11.2 km s@xmath51 , while the corresponding alfvn transit time is 109.9 s and 177.6 s , respectively .",
    "the domain of the numerical simulation is -1000 km @xmath52 1000 km , 0 @xmath53 2000 km , as shown in figure [ mag_field ] .",
    "the initial magnetic configuration is a force - free field with a current sheet located along the @xmath42-axis , which was used by @xcite and rewritten as follows :    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56    where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the background magnetic field and the half width of current sheet , respectively . in order to make our simulation more realistic",
    ", we use the temperature distribution of the quiet - sun atmospheric model valc as shown in figure  [ fig_ini ] ( left panel ) . using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation and the modified saha and boltzmann formula for calculating the number density of electrons iteratively , we get the initial number density of hydrogen ( @xmath59 ) and electrons ( @xmath60 ) as shown in the middle and the right panels of figure [ fig_ini ] , respectively . from these figures",
    "we can see that our initial model is very close to the valc model . in order to initiate the magnetic reconnection",
    ", we assume that an anomalous resistivity @xcite , with the form @xmath61 \\cos [ ( y - h_r)\\pi /2",
    "\\triangle h]$ ] , is localized in a small region @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( the small rectangle in figures [ mag_field ] , [ fig_sho ] and [ fig_case_jz ] ) , where @xmath64 stands for the height of the reconnection point ( x - point ) in the @xmath42-axis , @xmath58 is the half width of the resistivity region and @xmath65 is the resistive amplitude .",
    "it is noted that the half width of the resistivity region is taken to be the same as the half width of the current sheet .",
    "owing to the symmetry , the calculation is performed only in the right half region , with the symmetry boundary condition being set on the left - hand side .",
    "the right and the upper boundaries are treated as open boundaries .",
    "line - tying conditions are applied to the bottom boundary .",
    "it is noted that @xmath14 should satisfy the hydrostatic equilibrium ( @xmath66 ) to reach a balance between the gravity and the pressure gradient force at the upper and the lower boundaries .",
    "the calculation domain is discretized into @xmath67 grid meshes .",
    "the grid sizes are @xmath68 km and @xmath69 km , which are much less than the pressure scale height ( @xmath70 km ) . with gravity ,",
    "ionization and radiation being considered , and with heat conduction being neglected , the numerical simulations are performed with the cip - mocct scheme .",
    "generally speaking , the height of the x - point may change as the reconnection proceeds @xcite . in our simulation",
    ", we found that the x - point could move up or down by @xmath71 km , but still within the resistivity region .",
    "for this reason , we do not need to change the position of the resistivity region . in order to illustrate the dynamic process",
    ", this subsection describes the simulation results in a typical case , where the background magnetic field @xmath72 is taken to be 50 g , the anomalous resistivity @xmath73 be 17.7 @xmath74 m , the x - point height @xmath64 be 1000 km , and the half width of the resistivity region @xmath58 be 100 km .",
    "figure  [ fig_res ] depicts the results of the simulation at different times . in this figure the color stands for the temperature , solid lines for magnetic field and arrows for velocity .    as the anomalous resistivity sets in",
    ", we have a fast reconnection process similar to that predicted by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_rec ] shows the evolution of the reconnection rate , which is defined as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the maximum inflow velocity along the @xmath77-direction at the height of the x - point .",
    "it is found that the simulation stops at @xmath78 ( 148.2 s ) , probably due to some numerical instability .",
    "the reconnection rate reaches the maximum , 0.11 , at @xmath79 ( 120.8 s ) .",
    "after that , the reconnection rate remains almost constant around 0.1 .",
    "the lifetime of the reconnection simulated in this case ( 148.2 s ) is shorter than the typical lifetime of microflares , i.e. , @xmath4 minutes .",
    "maybe our results can only represent the pre - flare phase and the rise phase .    during the reconnection ,",
    "the temperature enhancement in the resistivity region is about @xmath80 k as shown in figure [ fig_tem ] .",
    "accelerated by the magnetic tension force , the hot plasma together with the frozen - in reconnected field lines are ejected from the resistivity region to form upward and downward reconnection jets .",
    "the maximum velocity of the upward and downward jets are about @xmath81 km s@xmath51 and @xmath82 km s@xmath51 , respectively as shown in figure  [ fig_vy ] .",
    "because of the sharp density gradient in the lower atmosphere , the speed of the upward jet is faster than that of the downward one . compared with the local alfvn speed ( @xmath83 km s@xmath51 ) at the height of 1000 km , we find that the velocity of the outflow is approximately the local alfvn speed in the inflow region .",
    "the downward jet can only reach the height of 600 km , after which it is slowed down significantly .",
    "furthermore , the reconnection x - point also rises by about 40 km during the reconnection process .    the hot plasma jet ejected along the @xmath42-axis is mainly heated by the joule dissipation in the resistivity region .",
    "however , we can not ignore the heating by the slow - mode shocks . in our simulation ,",
    "the heating occurs not only in the resistivity region but also outside the region as shown in figure  [ fig_sho ] , which shows the current density ( @xmath84-component ) distribution in the left panel and the temperature distribution in the right panel .",
    "it can be seen that a pair of slow - mode shocks , which are characterized by the high current density , are formed at the interface between the reconnection inflow and outflow , across which the plasma temperature increases drastically .",
    "it indicates that besides the joule dissipation , the slow - mode shock may be another effective way to heat plasma .      in our simulation ,",
    "the most important parameters are the background magnetic field , the anomalous resistivity , and the height of the x - point ( i.e. , the reconnection site ) . in order to show the influence of different parameters on the results",
    ", we performed extensive simulations by changing one parameter at a time with others being fixed .",
    "figure [ fig_par_rate ] shows the evolution of the magnetic reconnection rate for different initial background magnetic fields and anomalous resistivities , with the height of the initial x - point being 1000 km .",
    "it can be seen that the magnetic reconnection rate can reach the maximum much faster when we set a stronger initial magnetic field .",
    "it is also found that the large anomalous resistivity can shorten the evolution time from the initial stage to the time when the reconnection rate reaches the maximum .",
    "it should be noted here that , although the resistivity in the chromosphere is @xmath85 orders of magnitude larger than that in the corona , it is still too small from the simulation point of view .",
    "a so small resistivity would lead to a very thin diffusion layer near the reconnection x - point , which could not be resolved by the current numerical mesh .",
    "therefore , the values of the anomalous resistivity we used are several orders of magnitude larger than the classical spitzer resistivity ( e.g. , kovitya & cram 1983 ) .",
    "figure [ fig_par_temp ] shows the temperature distributions at the peak time of the magnetic reconnection rate .",
    "our results indicate that the temperature enhancement is sensitive to the magnetic field .",
    "however , in all cases our results are consistent qualitatively with the observed temperature enhancement in chromospheric microflares @xcite .",
    "a quantitative comparison between the simulation and the observation will be described in section 3.4 .",
    "the ranges of the variables such as the background magnetic field ( @xmath57 ) , anomalous resistivity ( @xmath65 ) and the number density of hydrogen ( @xmath59 ) are very wide in observations . as a result ,",
    "the maximum temperature enhancement ( @xmath1 ) and the reconnection lifetime ( @xmath2 ) may change greatly . in order to find a scaling law to relate @xmath1 and @xmath2 to the above - mentioned 3 variables",
    ", we change the variables one by one and perform a series simulations .",
    "as illustrated by figure [ fig_sca ] , the dataset can be well fitted by the following formula :    @xmath86    from the energy point of view , as the reconnection proceeds , the joule dissipation is consumed partly by the plasma radiation and ionization , with the rest being converted into the plasma heating .",
    "therefore , we have    @xmath87_{t=0}\\triangle t-[n_e-(n_e)_{t=0 } ] \\chi_h \\,\\ , ,   \\label{sca_2}\\ ] ]    where the expressions of @xmath60 , @xmath88 , @xmath41 are given by equations ( [ ne-1 ] ) , ( [ rad-2 ] ) , and ( [ rad-3 ] ) .",
    "the items on the right - hand side of the equation ( [ sca_2 ] ) are the joule dissipation , the radiative losses , the pre - heating and the ionization energy , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the plasma radiation and ionization are negligible , equation ( [ sca_2 ] ) can be rewritten in a simple form as    @xmath89    where @xmath24 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath90 is the scale of the reconnection region . since in our simulation @xmath90",
    "is fixed as a constant , we can get a simple theoretical formula as follow :    @xmath91    it can be seen that the formula ( [ sca_1 ] ) given by our simulations is similar to the formula ( [ sca_4 ] ) except the relatively bigger deviation of the power index of @xmath59 . the deviation is probably because the radiative loss and ionization items , which are related to @xmath59 but not to @xmath57 and @xmath65 , have been considered in our simulations but are neglected in the analytical form .",
    "a further study will be done in order to find a more realistic scaling law in the future .",
    "fang et al . (",
    "2006a ) analyzed five well - observed microflares and computed the thermal semi - empirical models for two typical microflares , one was bright and the other was faint .",
    "in oder to get the semi - empirical models , they first assume the temperature and turbulent velocity distributions , and then derive the density distribution . based on these distributions",
    "they can calculate the h@xmath6 and 8542  line profiles .",
    "the atmospheric model is adjusted until the calculated line profiles to match the observed ones .",
    "the temperature distribution of the bright microflares model is shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig_case ] . in order to reproduce the temperature enhancement in the model , we set the initial background magnetic filed to be 300 g , the anomalous resistivity to be 159.3 @xmath74 m , and the initial reconnection height to be 500 km .",
    "since the magnetic field is strong , the total evolution time is short .",
    "the evolution of the reconnection rate , the temperature enhancement , and the velocity along the @xmath42-axis ( @xmath16 ) are shown in figure  [ fig_case ] .",
    "after @xmath92 , the reconnection rate reaches about 0.1 .",
    "we choose the temperature distribution at 0.24 @xmath93 to compare with the semi - empirical model .",
    "it is shown that there are two peaks in our simulation results .",
    "the smaller one is located at the height of 350 km and the bigger one is almost the same as the semi - empirical model and located at the height of 600 km .",
    "the possible reason for this phenomenon is slow - mode mhd shock heating as shown in figure [ fig_case_jz ] .",
    "below 800 km , the temperature profile of our simulation is close to that of the semi - empirical model .",
    "however , above 800 km , the temperature in the semi - empirical model becomes much higher than that of our simulation .",
    "the discrepancy might result from the fact that our simulations are performed for a relatively short period such that the reconnection jet has not yet reached the corona .",
    "therefore , our result can only give a reasonable explanation for the temperature bump of the microflare mainly in the rise phase .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig_case ] shows the one - dimensional plot of @xmath16 . from this figure",
    "it can be seen that the height of the reconnection x - point , which is characterized by the null velocity , has dropped from 500 km at @xmath94 to 450 km at @xmath95 .",
    "the velocity of the upward flow is about 11.1 km s@xmath51 , which is much larger than that of the downward flow ( 1.8 km s@xmath51 ) .",
    "the downward jets can only reach the height of about 200 km .",
    "more and more theoretical works have indicated that magnetic reconnection in the solar lower atmosphere can produce chromospheric microflares @xcite , as well as other small activities like ellerman bombs @xcite . with gravity , ionization and radiation being considered , we performed 2.5d mhd simulations .",
    "since we have used the temperature distribution of the quiet - sun atmospheric model valc @xcite and considered the helium abundance ( @xmath0 ) , our simulations are realistic to some extent .    in our simulation ,",
    "we calculate the magnetic reconnection rate by using the definition @xmath96 , rather than the formula @xmath97 used by @xcite and @xmath98 stands for the @xmath84-component of current density .",
    "if we use the formula @xmath97 or @xmath99 , the reconnection rate has a large pulse , which can be greater than 1.0 at the beginning of the evolution .",
    "it is non - physical , as mentioned by @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that all of these methods can give a similar result after enough time of evolution .    in the subsections  [ dynamic process ] and  [ compare ] , we studied the magnetic reconnection with the x - point at different heights , e.g. , 500 km and 1000 km .",
    "our results , in the case of 500 km , can well reproduce the temperature enhancement in the semi - empirical model @xcite . at the heights of 500 km and 1000 km ,",
    "the temperature enhancement is 1000 - 2000 k and 2000 - 3000 k , respectively . in the case of 1000 km",
    ", we found that the height of x - point can move up by tens of kilometers .",
    "this is different from the results of the case of 500 km , where the x - point moves down .",
    "it is noted that the temperature enhancement we got in our simulations is several thousand kelvin , and our results can only represent the rise phase of chromospheric microflares since our simulations were performed only until the upward reconnection jet reaches the bottom of the transition region . of course",
    ", those microflares with strong euv , x - ray , and microwave emissions may occur at the lower corona . in this case , the emissions in x - rays , euv and microwave can be naturally explained .",
    "it is worth noting that our simulations have some limitations .",
    "even though we limited the computational height below @xmath100 km , the plasma @xmath101 at the bottom boundary is still six orders of magnitude larger than that at the top boundary .",
    "it causes some numerical instability in our simulations . besides , our initial magnetic configuration is relatively simple .",
    "moreover , as it is well known , the current sheet should be very thin in the real situation , e.g. , less than hundreds of meters , while in our simulation the minimum grid sizes are @xmath68 km and @xmath69 km , which are too large to simulate the current sheet .",
    "all these contribute to the fact that our simulations can not reproduce the real observations in details .",
    "further improvement of this work is expected .",
    "our 2.5d mhd simulations can reproduce the temperature enhancement in chromospheric microflares qualitatively .",
    "the temperature increase in the cases when the reconnection point is at the height of 500 km and 1000 km can reach 1000 - 2000 k and 2000 - 3000 k , respectively .",
    "the free parameters in our 2.5d simulation are the background magnetic field ( @xmath57 ) and the anomalous resistivity ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "we have found that the temperature enhancement is sensitive to the background magnetic field , while the total evolution time is sensitive to the magnitude of anomalous resistivity .",

    "<S> with gravity , ionization , and radiation being considered , we perform 2.5d compressible resistive mhd simulations of chromospheric magnetic reconnection using the cip - mocct scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature distribution of the quiet - sun atmospheric model valc and the helium abundance ( @xmath0 ) are adopted . </S>",
    "<S> our 2.5d mhd simulation reproduces qualitatively the temperature enhancement observed in chromospheric microflares . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature enhancement @xmath1 is demonstrated to be sensitive to the background magnetic field , whereas the total evolution time @xmath2 is sensitive to the magnitude of the anomalous resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> moveover , we found a scaling law , which is described as @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our results also indicate that the velocity of the upward jet is much greater than that of the downward jet and the x - point may move up or down . </S>"
