    "we conclude that besides recently reported applications in gas analysis @xcite , carbon nanotube ionization detectors are suitable detectors for cold atom experiments and as partial pressure gauge at ultrahigh vacuum level .",
    "the central part of the field ionization detector is a carpet of multiwall carbon nanotubes that is grown on top of a silicon substrate ( fig .",

    "the field enhancement factor @xmath19 depends on the geometry and distribution of nanotubes on the substrate and is discussed in section iii .",
    "a. by applying a negative voltage to the nanotube chip , the device operates as electron field emitter .",
    "we use this operational mode to characterize the field enhancement near nanotube tips . by applying a positive voltage to the nanotube chip",
    ", the nanotube tips are ionizing neutral atoms and accelerate derivative ions towards the mesh .",
    "we use this operational mode for atom detection .",
    "a channel electron multiplier ( cem ) is mounted 24 mm above the nanotube chip to detect charged particles .",
    "ions ( electrons ) passing through the mesh are attracted by the cem , which is on a negative ( positive ) potential on the order of few kv . a charged particle hitting the cem releases an avalanche of secondary electrons in the cem , resulting in a charge pulse that is amplified @xcite and detected with standard counting electronics @xcite .",
    "to keep ion ( electron ) trajectories uninfluenced from electric stray fields , the detector is placed in a faraday cage .",
    "we demonstrate the operation of the field ionization detector by counting rubidium atoms from a dispenser source @xcite .",
    "such dispensers are widely used in cold atom experiments for loading magneto - optical traps , the first step in the preparation of quantum gases @xcite .",
    "we characterize the constituents emitted by the rubidium dispenser in the appendix of this article and find that the emission of constituents other than rubidium can be neglected .",
    "in addition , we find that the ionization energy of rubidium ( @xmath20 @xcite ) is by more than a factor of three smaller than those of other constituents , thus in our setup rubidium is the most sensitive element to field ionization .",
    "the dispenser is directed towards the ionization detector and heated resistively .",
    "the emission of rubidium atoms starts at a temperature of @xmath21 k , and the atoms , with a mean thermal velocity of @xmath22 , impact the nanotube carpet directly . since the dispenser not only emits atoms but also positively charged rubidium ions , we lift the dispenser to a negative potential of @xmath23 with respect to ground",
    ". this attractive potential is sufficient to remove ions from the thermal beam .",
    "an additional faraday cage around the dispenser ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme1 ] ) makes sure that external fields are absent and all dispenser ions are attracted by the dispenser s body .",
    "hence , we reduce the background ion counting rate measured with the cem from @xmath24/s to @xmath25/s , at a dispenser current of @xmath26 a. the experiments are done in ultrahigh vacuum at a background pressure of @xmath27 mbar .",

    "the field enhancement factor @xmath28 depends only on the aspect ratio @xmath29 ( length over diameter ) of the nanotube and is given by @xcite : @xmath30 in an array of nanotubes , such as the carpet of carbon nanotubes in our experiment , the electrostatic field of neighboring nanotubes superimposes and reduces the field enhancement .",
    "the field enhancement factor @xmath19 thus depends not only on the aspect ratio of the constituting tubes , but also on the ratio of inter tube separation @xmath31 to the tube length @xmath32 @xcite : @xmath33 .",

    "however , nanotubes sticking out of the carpet reach much higher factors .",
    "this is because their larger aspect ratio , on the one hand , and also because the influence of neighboring nanotubes can be neglected , on the other hand . recognizing that individual nanotubes on our chip have aspect ratios of up to @xmath38 , field enhancement factors on the order of thousands are expected . by applying a voltage to the nanotube chip on",

    "we measure the field enhancement factor on our nanotube chip by measuring the field emission of electrons , i.e. by measuring the electric current tunneling out of negatively charged nanotube tips .",

    "we estimate the number of nanotubes contributing to the field emission by representing the emission area @xmath68 of a single contributing nanotube as the surface of a hemisphere with radius 1 nm .",
    "the number of contributing nanotubes is thus @xmath69 .",
    "as the total number of nanotubes on the chip is about @xmath70 , only one tube out of @xmath71 contributes to the field emission in the given voltage range .",
    "we conclude that the measured electric field at the surface of individual nanotubes on our chip , up to @xmath0v / m , is indeed sufficient to field ionize rubidium atoms .",
    "field ionization of atoms in electrostatic fields is described by quantum mechanics as tunneling out of an electron from the distorted coulomb potential into free space @xcite .",
    "the ionization rate @xmath72 is associated with the tunneling rate and is given by @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the ionization energy of the atom , @xmath75 the electrostatic field in free space , and @xmath76 a natural constant given by eq .",

    "we describe two experiments that demonstrate the operation of the field ionization detector . before the detector",
    "is first used , the nanotube chip is cleaned by exposing it to a high positive voltage ( 5000 v ) for several minutes , which removes adsorbed atoms and molecules from the nanotubes .",

    "the data are corrected for the background count rate that we measure under identical conditions but zero dispenser current .",
    "we notice that the rubidium flux for the two different heating currents differ by more than a factor of two .",
    "the fowler - nordheim equivalent plot in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : ionization1 ] shows a linear behavior , which is characteristic for field ionization . by fitting the theory ( eq .",

    "the electric field ( @xmath86 ) at the position of field ionization is less than @xmath87 of the field at the tip surface ( @xmath88 ) . because the electrostatic field near nanotube tips decays over a short distance , on the length scale of the tip radius ( @xmath89 nm ) we estimate that the spatial area in which field ionization takes place is in our experiment below 40 nm distance in front of the nanotube tips .",
    "based on the mean atomic velocity , @xmath90 m/s , we calculate that the ionization takes place on a time scale faster than @xmath1s .",
    "this finding is particularly interesting for the development of fast atom detectors for correlation measurements in cold gases .    in a second experiment",
    "we demonstrate the application of the field ionization detector as partial pressure gauge .",
    "we set the nanotube chip to a constant voltage and measure the response of the detector to a time varying flux of rubidium atoms .",

    "the ion count rate after switching off is well described by a double exponential decay ( inset in fig . [",
    "fig : onoff1 ] ) .",
    "we attribute the fast timescale , @xmath93 , to the cooling down of the dispenser and a corresponding reduction of the rubidium flux .",
    "the data is in good agreement with previously reported values @xcite .",
    "the slow time scale , @xmath94 , is due to rubidium background pressure that decays on a time scale given by the pumping speed of our vacuum system .",
    "a comparison between the ion counting rate and the pressure measured simultaneously with a commercial pressure gauge @xcite confirms our conclusion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : onoff3 ] ) that the field ionization detector is suitable for measuring the rubidium partial pressure .",
    "the qualitative difference between the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : onoff3 ] is the pressure peak between 0 and 30 s. this peak is due to a degassing of the dispenser shell when heating is turned on .",
    "the peak corresponds to vacuum background gas constituents mostly other than rubidium ( cf .",
    "appendix ) .",
    "the field ionization detector is not sensitive to these constituents since its discrimination voltage ( operation voltage ) has been set below their ionization limit .",
    "thus the detector counts in this case only rubidium atoms .",
    "the demonstrated field ionization detector outlines a range of new applications in cold atom physics .",
    "since ground state atoms and molecules can be field ionized near nanotips , field ionization detectors are suitable for in - situ or time - of - flight measurements on cold gases without using resonant light and optical imaging systems .",

    "we characterize the constituents emitted from a heated rubidium dispenser source by means of a quadrupole mass spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the dispenser source is directed towards the mass spectrometer and is at ultrahigh vacuum ( @xmath95 mbar ) in a chamber , which is pumped by a rotary vane pump and a turbo molecular pump , similar to the setup of the field ionization detector .",
    "figure [ fig : massspectrometer](a ) shows the mass spectrum of the residual background gas in the chamber with the dispenser source turned off .",
    "the spectrum was taken across 96 atomic mass units and averaged over @xmath96s to reduce statistical noise .",
    "we identify remaining air constituents like water ( @xmath97 ) , nitrogen ( @xmath98 ) and carbon dioxide ( @xmath99 ) as well as acetone remnants from cleaning solutions and components of pump oil .    after activating the rubidium dispenser source at @xmath100a , the pressure in the chamber rises and reaches its steady state value at @xmath101 mbar after a few minutes .",

    "as expected , this spectrum contains the signal of the rubidium isotopes @xmath102 and @xmath103 with a relative weight of @xmath104 close to the natural isotope ratio of @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the background spectrum [ fig . [",

    "we do not attribute this increased background to a direct emission from the dispenser source , but rather to an increased outgassing of vacuum components ( dispenser shell , supply cables , electrical feedthrough ) now at a higher temperature . to quantify the change in the spectrum due to the dispenser source , fig .",
