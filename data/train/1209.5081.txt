    "in general relativity , identical spacetimes are often given in different coordinate systems , thereby disguising the diffeomorphic equivalence of the underlying metrics .",
    "it is consequently of fundamental importance to have an invariant procedure for deciding the question of metric equivalence .",
    "one approach to this problem is to utilize scalar curvature invariants , obtained as full contractions of the curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives @xcite .",
    "however , a particularly intriguing situation arises when we consider pp - waves , space - times that admit a covariantly constant null vector field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 24 ) .. some time ago it was observed that all curvature invariants of a pp - wave spacetime vanish @xcite . subsequently all space - times with the vsi property ( vanishing scalar invariants ) and the more general csi property ( constant scalar invariants ) were classified @xcite .",
    "it is now known that either a spacetime is uniquely determined by its scalar curvature invariants , or is a degenerate kundt spacetime @xcite ; the vsi and csi solutions belong to this more general class .    to invariantly classify the degenerate kundt spacetimes , and pp - waves in particular , one must therefore use the karlhede algorithm @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9.2 ) , which is the cartan equivalence method @xcite adapted to the case of 4-dimensional lorentzian manifolds . the invariant classification proceeds by reducing the 6-dimensional lorentz frame freedom by normalizing the curvature tensor @xmath3 and its covariant derivatives , @xmath4 .",
    "the unnormalized components of @xmath4 are called _ cartan invariants_. we define the _ ic ( invariant classification ) order _ of a given metric to be the highest order @xmath5 required for deciding the equivalence problem for that metric .",
    "an upper bound on the ic order is often referred to as the _ karlhede bound_.    set @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( the dimension of the lorentz group ) . at each order @xmath8 ,",
    "let @xmath9 denote the number of functionally independent cartan invariants and let @xmath10 denote the dimension of the joint isotropy group of the normalized @xmath11 .",
    "the algorithm terminates as soon as @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "a value of @xmath14 means that there exists an invariant tetrad .",
    "if @xmath15 , then killing vectors are present .",
    "the dimension of the isometry group is @xmath16 .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to the sequence @xmath17 as the _ invariant count_.    in this paper , we focus on a particularly simple class of vsi spacetimes : the vacuum pp - waves , whose metric has the simple form shown in equation below .",
    "the symmetry classes for pp - waves were initially classified by kundt and ehlers @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 24.2 ) for vacuum solutions , and subsequently extended by sippel and goenner @xcite to the general case .",
    "the karlhede bound for pp - waves was investigated in @xcite and @xcite where @xmath2 was established ; however , it was not known whether this bound is sharp , or if it could be lowered further . despite the fact that these metrics have a very simple form , depending on just one parametric function @xmath18 ( see equation below )",
    ", the present paper is the first to present a complete invariant classification for vacuum pp - waves , and to establish the sharpness of the @xmath2 bound .",
    "all vacuum pp - waves have at least one killing vector .",
    "kundt and ehlers identified 3 classes of @xmath0 solutions , 4 classes of @xmath1 solutions , a universal form for the @xmath20 solutions , and two types of homogeneous @xmath21 solutions .",
    "below , we exhibit explicit cartan invariants that distinguish the various special sub - classes in an invariant fashion .    the @xmath22 solutions ( @xmath19 ) and the @xmath23 solutions ( @xmath24 ) form two distinct solution branches ; here @xmath25 is a fundamental 1st order invariant which will be defined precisely in section [ sect : ppwaves ] .",
    "the classification of the @xmath19 class is summarized in figure [ fig : g23 ] .",
    "the numbers in the solution labels refer to the invariant count with the initial 0 and any trailing @xmath26 omitted .",
    "thus , solution form @xmath27 refers to a metric with an invariant count of @xmath28 while @xmath29 refers to a @xmath0 solution with an invariant count of @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31 solutions have three independent invariants and thus their label indices end with a @xmath26 . for the same reason , the indices of the @xmath0 solutions end with a 2 while the indices of the @xmath32 solutions end with a @xmath33 .",
    "from the point of view of invariant classification there are 4 classes of generic @xmath0 solutions .",
    "we label these @xmath34 and summarize their invariant classification in table [ tab:022 ] ( the cartan invariants in the third column will be defined in section [ sect : g1 ] . ) kundt - ehlers described forms @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "their third @xmath0 form is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a holomorphic function and @xmath39 a real constant .",
    "the @xmath39 parameter is not essential , and if @xmath40 can be normalized to @xmath41 by means of a coordinate transformation . in terms of the present terminology",
    ", the kundt - ehlers solutions of type belong to class @xmath42 in the the case of @xmath43 , and and to class @xmath44 if @xmath45 ."
