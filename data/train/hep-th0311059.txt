    "stochastic inflation provides an efficient approach to study inflationary dynamics and has become a very popular way to describe the growth of density perturbations on scales larger than the hubble radius . in the first fundamental works @xcite , the inflaton field",
    "was split into a super - horizon and a sub - horizon part directly in the equation of motion .",
    "this splitting is operated in fourier space through a window function , that separates high from low frequencies .",
    "the relevant variable is the long - wavelength part , while the sub - horizon modes are collected in an effective noise term , playing the role of a classical perturbation to the super - horizon dynamics .",
    "the resulting effective equation of motion is then a langevin - like equation analogous to the one describing _",
    "brownian motion _",
    ", where the deterministic evolution is influenced and modified by the stochasticity of the source , whose effects can be taken into account only as a statistical average over time . indeed , in this formalism there is not any knowledge of the exact form of the noise , but only of its statistical properties .",
    "a more general approach exploits the influence functional method @xcite , and operates the frequency splitting at the action level getting rid of the high frequencies via a path - integral over the sub - horizon part of the field .",
    "the effective action thus obtained contains some extra terms that can be interpreted as the coupling of the super - horizon field with a classical random noise source , whose configurations are statistically weighted by an appropriate functional probability distribution , becoming the origin of the stochastic character of the langevin - like equation of motion .",
    "the super - horizon degrees of freedom are then treated as a purely classical field , all the quantum fluctuations being collected in the classical noise term .",
    "this feature is claimed not to be a simple computational trick , but an intrinsic characteristic of the system .",
    "stochasticity is thus not only a clue to understand the properties of inflation and the origin of the large - scale structure in the universe , but also as a way to explain the transition from a quantum to a classical world @xcite . from a formal point of view",
    ", the quantum decoherence process in the stochastic inflation framework has been discussed in various works @xcite , where it was pointed out that the classicality of the coarse - grained field ( implicitely assumed in the first papers ) is not necessarily assured , but is subject to some restrictive conditions .    using standard techniques of stochastic processes @xcite ,",
    "the langevin equation for the field expectation value leads to an evolution equation ( the fokker - planck equation ) for its probability distribution function . in the first works , the noise correlation time is assumed to be infinitesimally short , and the correlation function for different times can therefore be considered as being proportional to dirac s delta function @xmath0 , which sets its _ white - noise _ properties .",
    "this assumption allows to apply a well - known formalism for the derivation of the fokker - planck equation and its solution .",
    "however , the characteristic of the correlation function strongly depend on the window function , whose choice is not a mere mathematical tool , but has several physical effects @xcite .",
    "a white noise arises only as a consequence of a sharp momentum cutoff , whereas a smooth weighting avoids highly singular noise correlators and produces a _",
    "colored noise_.    the choice of a colored noise is interesting for at least two reasons .",
    "the first is that a sharp momentum - space cutoff seems rather unphysical , while a smooth weighting of the modes is much more likely .",
    "actually , the most natural way to integrate out the small - scale fluctuations is to average the field in configuration space , choosing an appropriate finite volume window function . in most cases",
    ", this choice results in a smooth weighting in fourier space ( thus producing a colored noise ) , while the sharp momentum - space cutoff corresponds to a rather complicated infinite volume window function in configuration space .",
    "it is possible to single out a wide class of window functions for which the shape of the colored noise correlation is asymptotically the same @xcite .",
    "a second reason may be the fact that a colored noise could play , during inflation , an important role in producing intrinsically non - gaussian density fluctuations as initial conditions for the subsequent evolution of the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite .    in the simplest single - field slow - roll models of inflation ,",
    "non - gaussian features in scalar perturbations are produced by either the self - interaction of the inflaton field @xcite , which are however constrained to be very small by the slow - roll conditions , or by the back - reaction of field fluctuations on the background metric , whose amplitude is also strongly constrained by the slow - roll conditions @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , however , that the most copious source of large - scale non - gaussianity is stored in the post - inflationary second - order evolution of perturbations , which sets in a universal level of non - gaussianity for the gauge - invariant gravitational potential , which turns out to be of order unity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we point out that there is another source of intrinsic , and generally scale - dependent non - gaussianity in the fluctuation pattern , which originates from the cross - talk between super and sub - horizon scale perturbation modes . on scales",
    "much larger than the hubble radius , non - gaussian features generally arise as a consequence of the non - linear multiplicative form of the langevin equation , when back - reaction effects are accounted for @xcite . however , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , these effects do not directly reflect into the statistical properties of cosmological perturbations on sub - horizon scales .",
    "indeed , in order to deal with fluctuations relative to our patch of the universe , one can not simply perform statistical averages over the entire ensemble of possible states , rather one should allow for the observed smoothness of our universe on large scales . a possible , though approximate , way to take this constraint into account is to replace ensemble averages with averages over the conditional probability density functional that fluctuations on sub - horizon scales assume a certain value , _ given that _",
    "the inflaton field is spatially homogeneous at @xmath1 , _",
    "i.e. _ about 60 e - folds before the end of inflation ( corresponding to a comoving scale slightly larger than the present hubble radius ) .",
    "this is equivalent to set , for the probability distribution of the fluctuations , the ` initial ' condition @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "although this may happen ( and in most models it does ) well after the beginning of the accelerated expansion , if the noise driving the fluctuations is white their evolution is markovian , implying that any notion of the previous history is erased .",
    "the probability distribution then behaves exactly as if inflation had started at that time and the level of the inflaton non - gaussianity remains fully negligible . on the contrary",
    ", a colored noise has a non - vanishing correlation time : because of this fact the inflaton keeps memory of what happened before the constraint , and its evolution ceases to be a markov process . in this scenario",
    ", the probability distribution evolves in a different way , and also higher moments become important .    since the solution of the fokker - planck equation with colored noise carries several complications and is still a partly unknown matter , in this paper we followed a different approach , trying to perturbatively determine the probability distribution for the inflaton field directly solving the langevin equation in a statistical way .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ derivazeqmoto ]",
    "we briefly describe the derivation of the stochastic equation of motion for the inflaton field averaged over super - horizon scales , using the influence functional method , and evaluate the dependence of the noise on the choice of window function . in section [ spettri ]",
    "we then choose a specific gaussian shaped filter , obtaining the related ( colored ) noise correlation functions , and the variance and power - spectrum of the coarse - grained fluctuation field .",
    "in section [ interacting ] , after introducing a small non - linear ( cubic ) term in the potential , we evaluate the bispectrum and the third moment of the field . in section [ distrprob ]",
    "we investigate the memory effects induced by this colored noise and build up a formalism to quantitatively determine the relevance of the non - gaussian features of the distribution and their sensitivity to the times before @xmath3 .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusioni ] we draw our conclusions",
    ". some technical aspects of our calculation are reported in five appendices .",
    "we consider a background de sitter space - time , whose metric reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the scale - factor ( the hubble parameter @xmath6 is constant in time ) and @xmath7 is the conformal time defined by @xmath8 ,",

    "the short - wavelength part is defined as @xmath22,\\ ] ] where the window function @xmath23 projects out the long - wavelength modes .",
    "the long - wavelength part is then simply @xmath24 . substituting this field decomposition into the action ( [ azione ] ) we obtain two distinct free actions for the two fields plus an interaction term : @xmath25=s[\\phi_<]+s[\\phi_>]+s_{int}[\\phi_<,\\phi_>]\\ ] ] in order to obtain real _ in - in _ vacuum expectation values for the field @xmath19 instead of the usual _ in - out _ transition amplitudes , the standard procedure is to work in the _ closed time path _ ( ctp ) formalism @xcite of out - of - equilibrium field theory .",
    "indeed , in ordinary quantum field theory , one deals with transition amplitudes in particle reactions and one may not study the dynamics of the system .",
    "this is because one needs the temporal evolution with definite initial conditions and not simply the transition amplitudes of particle reactions with fixed initial and final conditions .",
    "while ordinary quantum field theory yields quantum averages of operators evaluated with an _ in_-state and an _ out_-state , the ctp formalism yields quantum averages of operators evaluated in the _",
    "in_-state without specifying the _ out_-state . in the ctp formalism",
    "@xcite the time integration is made along a closed path going from the initial time to positive infinity and back to the initial time ; the path - integral on the field configurations is evaluated on this closed path , along which they need not assume the same values on the forward and backward branches of the time contour .",
    "this is equivalent to considering two fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with the constraint @xmath28 , with the ordinary single time integration on the real axis .",
    "these two fields have to be set equal to each other in the equation of motion.we thus end up with four different fields @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 for small and large scales , and forward and backward times",
    ".    the effective equation of motion for the _ in - in _ expectation value of the super - horizon fields @xmath33 can be derived by integrating the action over the sub - horizon field variable @xmath34 .",
    "the super - horizon effective action obtained in this way contains two extra terms in addition to the ordinary action ( [ azione ] ) , describing physical effects related to the horizon crossing of the various normal modes @xcite .",
    "one of them contains both dissipation and non - local mass renormalization effects , while the other describes the influence on the super - horizon modes by the sub - horizon ones , whose quantum fluctuation can be treated as a stochastic noise .",
    "this second term is purely imaginary , and as such it can not be interpreted as a standard action : indeed , it appears as the result of a statistical weighting over the configurations of the stochastic noise fields representing sub - horizon quantum fluctuations , which couple to @xmath35 in the effective action @xmath36 $ ] .",

    "the coupling of the two random noises @xmath37 and @xmath38 with the scalar field is slightly different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the reason is that the choice of a general window function @xmath45 ( which is not necessarily able to produce a sharp cut in the frequencies , but can have some spread around the horizon scale ) can introduce a @xmath46-dependence in the effective field coupling to the noise , thereby spoiling the separation between super- and sub - horizon scales .",
    "our different choice of basis avoids this problem .",
    "another consequence of this formulation is that the correlation functions of the two noise fields are different from each other , and cross - correlations appear , in a similar way to ref .",

    "this behaviour is due to the fact that for small @xmath75 the window function tends to unity , and larger and larger scales are included in the noise @xmath48 , whose correlation function therefore reproduces the ordinary fluctuation behaviour ( when all scales are taken into account ) . for increasing @xmath75 , instead , since the window function vanishes ,",
    "the noise contains only smaller and smaller wavelengths , and is no more able to influence super - horizon scales .",

    "to this aim we first modified the standard scheme in order to allow for the cross - talk of perturbations on super and sub - horizon scales .",
    "such an effect is indeed totally absent in the traditional stochastic inflation dynamics ; this is an artifact of the sharp k - space filter adopted in the coarse - graining procedure , which is easily removed by adopting a smoother filter function , leading to a colored - rather than white - noise source in the langevin - like equation which governs the evolution of the coarse - grained inflaton field .",
    "this modification implies that the evolution of the coarse - grained inflaton field behaves as a non - markovian stochastic process , in contrast to the standard case .",

    "our most important findings are :    * the variance of inflaton fluctuations grows quadratically with time around @xmath141 , and is therefore smaller than in the standard markovian case , which is linearly dependent on time ; this is equivalent to say that the power - spectrum of density perturbations gets bluer on very large scales , without invoking any ad - hoc new physical input .",

    "the scheme presented here should be considered only as a first step in this direction , which needs to be largely improved and extended in various ways .",
    "first of all , one should consistently include metric perturbations in the inflaton dynamics , going beyond our fixed de sitter background treatment .",
    "second , our choice of a gaussian filter can be somewhat arbitrary , and it would be important to understand how much the results depend on its choice .",

    "@xcite , according to which there is a wide class of filters whose noise correlators show the same asymptotic behaviour @xmath197 found in this paper ( see eq . ) , are however quite encouraging in this respect .",
    "actually , since the window function is only a technical device , we would expect our results to be independent of its choice , at least qualitatively .",
    "the white - noise exception is not significant , being merely a consequence of the `` bad '' choice of smoothing in configuration space .",
    "the existence of memory effects means that the detailed dynamics of inflation plays a role in the specific form assumed by observable quantities .",
