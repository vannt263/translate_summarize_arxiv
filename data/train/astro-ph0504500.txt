    "through their stellar winds , uv radiation , molecular outflows , and eventual death as supernova , high mass stars ( @xmath2 , or earlier than b2 ) have a profound influence on their local environment and collectively on the galaxy as a whole .",
    "the past 15 years has seen renewed interest in the study of high mass star formation ( hmsf ) . this can be directly traced to three main factors : ( 1 ) the use of the iras catalog to identify large numbers of candidate hmsf regions , ( 2 ) the discovery of class ii methonal maser emission and its clear association with known regions of hmsf , and ( 3 ) improvements in both resolution and sensitivity at infrared and longer wavelengths .",
    "the recent realization that most stars form in dense clusters adds a new dimension to hmsf studies .",
    "embedded clusters may be the basic unit of star formation ( lada & lada 2003 ) , many dominated by ionizing ob stars , so the study of the earliest stages of hmsf is of direct importance to star formation as a whole .    the iras point source catalog ( psc ; beichman et  al .  1985 )",
    "has been used over the past @xmath315 years to define samples of candidate hmsf regions , in particular ultra - compact hii ( uchii ) regions .",
    "wood & churchwell ( 1989 , hereafter wc89 ) showed that known embedded o - stars ( i.e. , uchii regions ) occupy a tight region in iras color - color space , which is distinct from other sources that also possess rising spectral energy distributions ( seds ) in the far - infrared ( fir ) and from the general population of psc entries .",
    "this pioneering study has served as a starting point and guide for many subsequent studies of large numbers of hmsf regions . in particular , methanol maser and radio continuum surveys of sources selected using the wc89 criterion",
    "have identified numerous uchii regions ( schutte et  al.1993 ; van der walt , gaylard & macleod 1995 ; walsh et  al .",
    "more recently the wc89 criterion together with iras flux criteria and an absence of significant radio continuum emission ( i.e. , no associated uchii ) has been used to identify and study the supposedly younger high mass protostellar objects ( hmpos ; palla et  al .",

    "luminosities of sources selected using the wc89 criterion are often difficult to determine because of a lack of velocity information or to the difficulty in breaking the near / far distance ambiguity . because it is now assumed a priori that methanol masers are only associated with hmsf regions , deciding on the near / far ambiguity is often achieved by assuming an ionising source .    in this paper",

    "no masers were found . the most luminous source in our sample with @xmath5680  is almost as luminous as the least luminous sources showing methanol maser emission , @xmath31000 .",
    "this leads us to examine the nature of wc89 sources with low fluxes , as some of our sample satisfy the wc89 criterion for candidate uchii regions based solely on their iras colors .",
    "for the first time we are able to show that some low mass protostars contaminate the low flux end of the wc89 sample , a result that was suggested by van der walt ( 1997 ) and ramesh & sridharan ( 1997 ) but that has not previously been confirmed observationally .",
    "we also estimate the contamination level of wc89 by low mass protostars .",
    "as this was intended only as a pilot survey to examine whether any low luminosity young stellar objects exhibit 6.7 ghz methanol maser emission , the source list was not selected with rigor .",
    "however , we did aim to observe low - luminosity sources with a range of luminosities , from a few to a few hundred solar luminosities .",
    "sources were selected from lists of iras sources associated with southern dark molecular clouds ( persson & campbell 1987,1988 ; persi  1990 ; bourke , hyland & robinson 1995a ) . because of their association with dark clouds , it was assumed that these sources are relatively nearby ( mostly @xmath6 1kpc , and almost always @xmath6 2kpc ) , and so are low- to intermediate - mass objects .",

    "the dispersion in scale height for the wc89 sources is greatest at low values of @xmath20 , being @xmath3 4  for log  @xmath23 , and remaining constant at @xmath3 1  for log  @xmath24 , where most of the 6.7 ghz masers are found ( van der walt 1997 ) .",

    "this would neatly explain the lack of 6.7 ghz maser detections for these objects - not all wc89 objects are uchii regions , and methanol maser emission is not expected from low- to intermediate - mass young stars ( sobolev 1997 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1(a ) , which plots the [ 2512 ] versus [ 6012 ] colors for the sources surveyed in this work ( _ open diamonds _ ) and the iras sources associated with bok globules from bourke ( 1995a ) that are detected at 12 , 25 and 60  with @xmath25 , and so are most likely to be low - mass protostars . also shown on this figure are the regions defined by wc89 for uchii regions , and by emerson ( 1987 ; see also bourke  1995a ) for embedded , nearby low - mass protostellar `` cores '' ( beichman  1986 ) . as can be seen in the figure ,",

    "if we include all sources with @xmath43 then we find 99 sources ( 69% ) . from these numbers",
    "we conclude that about 50% of the fir faint and radio quiet wc89 sources are actually low to intermediate mass star forming regions ( including non - ionizing clusters ) .",
    "about one quarter of the wc89 sample are fir faint and radio quiet according to ramesh & sridharan ( 1997 ) , so we conclude for the sample as a whole that the contamination level is @xmath44 .",

    "protostellar sources that satisfy wc89 and also have log  @xmath46 14.0 are plotted in figure 1(b ) , and are listed in table  [ tbl - lowmass ] .",

    "thus , a requirement that sources satisfying wc89 also satisfy log  @xmath46 14.0 and  @xmath4 100 jy may select a sample with a high percentage of uchii regions , though it would not be a complete galactic census .",

    "no equivalent survey is available for pm .",
    "they did observe a large percentage of their list in nh@xmath47  ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) ( 163 sources ) , finding mean linewidths of 1.73  for their high sample and 1.47  for the low sample . in comparison , benson & myers ( 1989 )",

    "it is difficult to determine the luminosity and hence spectral type of protostellar sources , so it is presently unclear whether non - ionizing sources are able to produce methanol masers",
    ". it would be interesting to carefully determine @xmath49 for all the known methanol masers to approximate the lower luminosity for maser emission ( although ir counterparts for a number of methanol masers are unknown ) , as well as the luminosity of all those sources that been searched for methanol maser emission with null results .",
    "this large task is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a preliminary examination of published values of @xmath49 of methanol maser sources shows that almost all sources have @xmath50  ( i.e. , earlier than b3 ) , with iras 174633128 ( van der walt et al.1995 ) at 880  the lowest we could find ( cf . iras 112785940 with @xmath51 is a null detection in the current work ) .",

    "to show this conclusively for the first time , we identified a number of low - mass protostars in this work and from the literature that satisfy the wc89 iras two - color criterion for candidate uchii regions , and have log  @xmath46 14.0 , which is the observation cut off limit for 6.7 ghz methanol maser emission .",
    "this result clearly shows that the lower flux end of sources satisfying this criterion is contaminated by low - mass protstars .",
