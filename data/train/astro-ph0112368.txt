    "atomic hydrogen is an important component of the interstellar media of spiral galaxies ( mckee & ostriker 1977 ) and much efforts have been devoted to its studies ( see this volume ) . from the point of view of fluid mechanics , hi , as well as other components of interstellar medium , is characterised by huge reynolds numbers , @xmath0 , which is the ratio of the eddy turnover time of a parcel of gas to the time required for viscous forces to slow it appreciably .",
    "for @xmath1 we expect gas to be turbulent and this is exactly what we observe in hi ( for hi @xmath2 ) .",
    "statistical description is a nearly indispensable strategy when dealing with turbulence .",
    "the big advantage of statistical techniques is that they extract underlying regularities of the flow and reject incidental details .",
    "attempts to study interstellar turbulence with statistical tools date as far back as the 1950s ( see horner 1951 , kampe de feriet 1955 , munch 1958 , wilson et al .",
    "1959 ) and various directions of research achieved various degree of success ( see reviews by kaplan & pickelner 1970 , dickman 1985 , lazarian 1992 , armstrong , rickett & spangler 1995 ) .",
    "studies of turbulence statistics of ionized media were successful ( see spangler & gwinn 1990 ) and provided the information of the statistics of plasma density at scales @xmath3-@xmath4  cm .",
    "this research profited a lot from clear understanding of processes of scintillations and scattering achieved by theorists ( see narayan & goodman 1989 ) . at the same time",
    "the intrinsic limitations of the scincillations technique are due to the limited number of sampling directions , relevance only to ionized gas at extremely small scales , and impossibility of getting velocity ( the most important ! ) statistics directly .    ``",
    "seeing through dust '' at 21 cm potentially provides an enormous leap for turbulence studies .",
    "first of all , statistics of hi line carries the velocity information . secondly , the statistical samples are extremely rich and not limited to discrete directions .",
    "thirdly , hi emission allows to study turbulence at large scales which have direct relation to the scales of star formation and energy injection .",
    "deficiencies in the theoretical description has been , to our mind , the major impediment to studies of turbulence using 21-cm data cubes . in particular , crovisier & dickey ( 1983 ) green ( 1993 ) measured the spectrum of 21-cm intensity fluctuations , but it was unclear what those spectra mean .",
    "sally oey ( this volume ) identifies several known problems of studying hi turbulence .",
    "they are ( _ a _ ) integration of fluctuations along lines of sight , ( _ b _ ) contribution of velocity and density to the emissivity statistics and ( _ c _ ) effects of absorption .",
    "the problems related to ( _ a _ ) were dealt in lazarian ( 1995 ) , while the issues ( _ b _ ) and ( _ c _ ) happen to be more formidable and have been dealt with only recently ( lazarian & pogosyan 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "earlier reviews dealing with hi studies include lazarian ( 1999a , b ) . in this volume",
    "one can read more about turbulence in cho , lazarian & yan and vazquez - semadeni papers .",
    "doppler shifted spectral lines carry information about turbulent velocity , but until very recently there was no way of extracting this information .",
    "the problem is that both velocity and density fluctuations contribute to the fluctuations of the intensity at a given velocity . in other words : _ we know the statistics of spectral lines , i.e. the statistics in velocity space , while we want to determine the actual 3d statistics . _    * statistics in 3d * + turbulence theory deals with the statistics of turbulence in real space that can be described by 3d correlation and structure functions ( see monin & yaglom 1975 ) . for instance",
    ", if density correlation function ( cf ) is isotropic in @xmath5-space then @xmath6 the power spectrum provides an alternative description and is related to the correlation function as @xmath7 where integration is performed over the 3d space . for power - law statistics ,",
    "the @xmath8 dimensional power spectrum @xmath9 and correlation function @xmath10 have indexes related as @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , @xmath12    * statistics in position position velocity ( ppv ) space * + one does not observe the gas distribution in the real space galactic coordinates @xmath13 .",
    "rather , intensity of the emission in a given spectral line is measured towards some direction on the sky and at a given line - of - sight velocity @xmath14 . in the plane",
    "parallel approximation the direction on the sky can be identified with the 2d spatial vector @xmath15 perpendicular to the line of sight , so that the coordinates of experimental ppv cubes are @xmath16 . if we chose galactic coordinates so that @xmath17 specify the direction of observation and @xmath18 is the coordinate along the line of sight @xmath19",
    ", then the relation between the real space and the ppv descriptions is that of a map @xmath20 .      the density of emitters in the ppv space @xmath28",
    "can then be written as @xmath29 { \\mathrm d { \\bf x } d } v   \\label{rhoz}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the density of gas in the galactic coordinates .",
    "this expression just counts the number of atoms along the line - of - sight * x * which have z - component of velocity in the interval @xmath31 $ ] the limits of integration are defined by the extend of spatial distribution of emitting gas .",
    "the statistics available in ppv are the correlation functions + @xmath32 and the power spectra of the emissivity fluctuations .",
    "the latter may be 3d , 2d and 1d .",
    "the relation between those spectra and the underlying velocity and density spectra were established in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) . in practical terms ,",
    "the most frequently used is the 2d spectrum of velocity slices .",
    "this spectrum can be directly obtained with radiointerferometric observations ( see lazarian 1995 ) .",
    "* velocity - channel analysis ( vca ) * + the vca technique has been developed in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 , henceforth lp00 ) for analyzing line profile formation in the presence of turbulence .",
    "we have predicted analytically that the relative contribution of the velocity and density fluctuations to the total fluctuations of intensity changes in a regular fashion with the width of the velocity slice .",
    "this is easy to understand qualitatively , as it is clear that the line integration should decrease the influence of velocity fluctuations .",
    "we have shown that if the 3-d density spectrum is @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the wavenumber ) , two distinct regimes are present when : ( a ) @xmath35 , and ( b ) @xmath36 .",
    "our results are summarized in table  1 .",
    "lcc slice & shallow 3-d density & steep 3-d density + thickness & @xmath37 , @xmath35&@xmath37 , @xmath36 + 2-d intensity spectrum for thin  slice & @xmath38 & @xmath39 + 2-d intensity spectrum for thick  slice & @xmath40 & @xmath41 + 2-d intensity spectrum for very thick  slice & @xmath40 & @xmath40 +    it is easy to see that both in cases ( a ) and ( b ) the power law index _ gradually steepens _ with the increase of velocity slice thickness . in the thickest velocity slices",
    "the velocity information is averaged out and it is natural that we get the density spectral index @xmath42 .",
    "the velocity fluctuations dominate in thin slices , and if the 3-d velocity power spectrum is @xmath43 , then the index @xmath26 can be found from thin slices ( see table  1 ) .",
    "note , that the notion of thin and thick slices depends on a turbulence scale under study and the same slice can be thick for small scale turbulent fluctuations and thin for large scale ones .",
    "the formal criterion for the slice to be thick is that _ the dispertion of turbulent velocities on the scale studied should be less than the velocity slice thickness_. otherwise the slice is _",
    "thin_.    predictions of lp00 were tested in lazarian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using numerical mhd simulations of compressible intersterllar gas .",
    "simulated data cubes allowed both density and velocity statistics to be measured directly .",
    "then these data cubes were used to produce synthetic spectra which were analysed using the vca . as the result",
    ", the velocity and density statistics were successfully recovered .",
    "thus one can confidently apply the technique to hi observations .",
    "note , that the vca is only sensitive to velocity . ] and density gradients on the scale under study , so the regular galactic rotation curve or large scale distribution of emitting gas does not interfere with the analysis .",
    "further research in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2002 ) incorporated the effects of absorption into the vca .",
    "namely , we have shown that in the presence of strong absorption a universal spectrum with index @xmath44 is being produced in very thick slices , provided that the density is steep .",
    "the universality means that the emissivity spectral index does not depend on the underlying statistics of velocity and density . for shallow density",
    ", its spectral index determines the emissivity statistics . to get velocity information",
    "thin slices must be used .",
    "in the case of smc the vca reveals the kolmogorov - type spectrum , @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 is the energy contained in eddies with @xmath47 ( eddy size)@xmath48 ) for velocity fluctuations and a slightly more shallow spectrum of density fluctuations over the range of scales from 4 kpc to 40 pc .",
    "[ h!t ] = 2.5 in = 2.5 in    a spectral index similar to the one for smc has been inferred from the 21  cm galactic data in green ( 1993 ) . however , that index shows more variability , which can stem from a number of causes .",
    "first of all , lp00 predicts , and the analysis of fig",
    ".  1 confirms , that the emissivity index depends on whether or not the velocity dispersion on the scale under study is larger or smaller than the thickness of the channel map . in green ( 1993 ) the physical scales and",
    "therefore the associated velocity dispersion vary considerably for close and distant slices of hi .",
    "moreover , for the close slices the geometry of parallel lines of sight adopted in lp00 does not provide a good approximation and the convergence of the lines of sight must be accounted for .",
    "the situation is even more complicated for the inner parts of the galaxy , where ( a ) two distinct regions at different distances from the observer contribute to the emissivity for a given velocity and ( b ) effects of the absorption are important .",
    "however , the analysis in dickey et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that some progress may be made even in those unfavorable circumstances .",
    "dickey et al . ( 2001 ) found the steepening of the spectral index with the increase of the velocity slice thickness .",
    "they also observed the spectral index for strongly absorbing direction approached @xmath44 in accordance with the conclusions in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2002 ) .",
    "21-cm absorption provides another way of probing turbulence on small scales .",
    "the absorption depends on the density to temperature ratio @xmath49 , rather than to @xmath50 as in the case of emission .",
    "however , in terms of the vca this change is not important and we still expect to see emissivity index steepening as velocity slice thickness increases , provided that velocity effects are present . in view of this , results of deshpande et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who did not see such steepening , can be interpreted as the evidence of the viscous suppression of turbulence on the scales less than 1  pc .",
    "the fluctuations in this case should be due to density and their shallow spectrum @xmath51 may be related to the damped magnetic structures below the viscous cutoff ( see cho , lazarian , yan , this volume ) .",
    "clearly , more vca studies of galactic hi are required . as the vca can be used for other emission lines ( e.g. co , h@xmath52 ) ,",
    "cross - correlation of turbulence properties in hi , molecular and ionized gas is necessary to obtain an insight into the dynamic coupling of different interstellar phases .",
    "* genus analysis * + velocity and density power spectra do not provide the complete description of turbulence .",
    "intermittency of turbulence ( its variations in time and space ) and its topology in the presence of different phases are not described by the power spectrum .     genus analysis \" is a good tool for studying the topology of turbulence ( see review by lazarian 1999 ) , receiving well - deserved recognition for cosmological studies ( gott et al .",
    "consider an area on the sky with contours of projected density .",
    "the 2d genus , @xmath53 , is the difference between the number of regions with a projected density higher than @xmath54 and those with densities lower than @xmath54 .",
    "4 shows the 2d genus as the function of @xmath54 for a gaussian distribution of densities ( completely symmetric curve ) , for mhd isothermal simulations with mach number 2.5 , and for hi in smc ( fig .",
    "4b ) .    [ h!t ] = 2.5 in = 2.5 in    isothermal mhd simulations",
    "exhibit more or less symmetric density distributions , but the smc data reflect a prominent swiss cheese topology , which also can be suggested from the visual inspection of the image ( see fig .",
    "however , unlike visual inspection , the genus quantifies the topology and allows us to compare numerical results with observations .",
    "note , that the mhd simulations in fig  4a are not so different from the smc in terms of the power spectrum .",
    "* anisotropy analysis * + in isotropic turbulence , correlations depend only on the distance between the points .",
    "contours of equal correlation are circular in this case .",
    "presence of magnetic field introduces anisotropy and these contours become elongated with a symmetry axis given by the magnetic field . to study turbulence anisotropy",
    ", we can measure contours of equal correlation corresponding to the data within various velocity bins .",
    "the results obtained with simulated data are shown in fig .",
    "[ h!t ] = 2.5 in = 2.5 in    since the anisotropy is related to the magnetic field , the studies of anisotropy can provide means to analyze magnetic fields .",
    "it is important to study different data sets and channel maps for the anisotropy .",
    "optical and infrared polarimetry can benchmark the anisotropies in correlation functions .",
    "we hope that the anisotropies will reveal magnetic field within dark clouds where grain alignment and therefore polarimetry fails ( see lazarian 2000 , astro - ph/0003314 for a review of grain alignment ) .",
    "for the first time ever we have an adequate theoretical description of spectral line statistics in the presence of both velocity and density fluctuations .",
    "this must be exploited to get adequate description of interstellar turbulence .",
    "hi data cubes present a great opportunity for such a study . to get a better understading of interstellar dynamics we propose using complementary tools like _ genus _ and _ anisotropy analysis _ and correlating the statistics of hi with that of molecular species and ions .",
