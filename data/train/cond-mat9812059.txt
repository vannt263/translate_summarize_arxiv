    "the study of two coupled identical systems is a familiar topic in statistical physics , both in equilibrium @xcite and non equilibrium contexts @xcite .",
    "it is commonly considered in the physics of glassy systems @xcite , where it is a substitute to the time honored conjugate field in the exploration of phase space . in this note",
    ", we wish to extend these studies to the case of two compact polymer chains .",
    "the coupling between the chains is chosen as an attractive term which favors the existence of common monomers ( bonds ) ; in other words , we consider the `` adsorption '' of a chain onto the other . by a legendre transform",
    ", this model maps onto the overlap probability distribution of the chains .    for simplicity",
    ", we will consider fully compact chains .",
    "this allows us to use a simple spin representation @xcite to describe the chain properties through hamiltonian paths . beside its interest in homopolymer physics",
    ", this model may yield some insight in the sequence - stucture relationship in proteins , or in some related optimization problems such as the travelling salesman .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we briefly recall in section [ sec : hampa ] the connection between a single polymer chain and an @xmath4-component spin system , in the limit @xmath0 .",
    "the extension to the problem of two interacting chains ( section [ sec : twoham ] ) is then straightforward , and will be solved at a mean field level in section [ sec : saddle ] .",
    "we finally mention some possible consequences of the model .",
    "the connection between polymer physics and spin systems may be presented as follows @xcite .",
    "let us consider , on each site @xmath5 of a @xmath6-dimensional cubic lattice , a spin variable @xmath7 , with @xmath4 components .",
    "the normalization is such that @xmath8 .",
    "consider the sum : @xmath9 where the variable @xmath10 denotes the fugacity of a monomer , and the product runs over neighbouring pairs of sites ( i.e. bonds ) of the lattice . in eq ( [ o(n ) ] ) , @xmath11 is the normalized integration measure on the @xmath12 dimensional sphere of radius @xmath13 .    due to the normalization of @xmath7 , it is easy to see that @xmath14 so that , by taking derivative with respect to @xmath15 ( @xmath16 , we obtain :    @xmath17    all higher powers of @xmath7 are at least of order @xmath4 .    expanding eq ( [ o(n ) ] ) in powers of @xmath10 , and using the previous remark , we see that @xmath18 can be viewed as a sum over all closed loops , each closed loop of length @xmath19 contributing a weight @xmath20 . in the limit @xmath21 ,",
    "only the single connected loops survive , hence the possibility to represent self - avoiding walks ( saw ) on the lattice by eq ( [ o(n ) ] ) . a very useful rewriting of eq ( [ o(n ) ] )",
    "is @xmath22 where the operator @xmath23 is a lattice @xmath24 function ( @xmath25 , if @xmath5 and @xmath26 are neighbouring sites , and @xmath27 otherwise ) .",
    "note that the sum in the exponential term of eq ( [ expo ] ) is over the sites of the lattice . applying the familiar stratonovich - hubbard transformation to eq ( [ expo ] )",
    ", we introduce @xmath0 component fields @xmath28 and get @xmath29 using eq ( [ field ] ) , we get @xmath30 so far we have not specified the spatial extension of the saw : @xmath18 is the grand partition function of the chain , so that the number @xmath31 of sites of the lattice is not related to the number @xmath32 of bonds of the saw .",
    "we now require that fully compact configurations are the only configurations present in eq ( [ expo3 ] ) , i.e. @xmath33",
    ". this full compactness requirement amounts to keep the term proportional to @xmath34 in eq ( [ expo3 ] ) .",
    "the coefficient of this term is simply the number @xmath35 of self avoiding fully compact configurations ( also called hamiltonian paths or hp ) , that is @xmath36 note that @xmath37 is simply the canonical partition function for a hp of @xmath32 bonds . performing a homogeneous saddle point approximation on @xmath38 in eq ( [ expo4 ] ) yields @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the coordination number of the lattice .",
    "note that in the context of hamiltonian paths , an homogeneous solution implies that one deals with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ expo4 ] ) holds for an arbitrarily connected graph with adjacence matrix @xmath41 , but the saddle point evaluation is a priori valid only for large enough @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , for the fully connected graph ( @xmath43 ) , the number of hp can be directly estimated ( @xmath44 ) , and eq ( [ meanfi ] ) reduces to the stirling formula .",
    "we now extend the above approach to the case of two interacting self avoiding chains . by `` interacting chains '' , we mean that the presence of common ( or doubly occupied ) bonds between the chains is thermodynamically favored , and we are interested in counting the number of configurations of two such hp .    following eq ( [ o(n ) ] ) , we denote by @xmath10 the fugacity of a monomer and consider the sum @xmath45 where @xmath46 has the same properties as @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , and the parameter @xmath49 is a measure of the interaction between the chains ( see below ) .",
    "the contribution of doubly occupied bonds to eq ( [ o(2n ) ] ) is proportional to @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number of these bonds ( implying @xmath52 ) .",
    "following exactly the same steps as in section [ sec : hampa ] , we have @xmath53 with @xmath54 performing the stratonovitch - hubbard transformation on eqs.([doub1 ] ) and ( [ doub2 ] ) yields @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 note that the previous transformations require two @xmath4 component fields @xmath28 and @xmath58 , and an @xmath59 matrix @xmath60 , with @xmath0 .",
    "one may now perform the integration over the original spin variables @xmath7 and @xmath61 in eq ( [ doub3 ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath62 where @xmath63 so far , we have not specified the spatial extension of the chains .",
    "the sum @xmath64 is grand canonical with respect to both singly and doubly occupied bonds . following the previous section",
    ", we now enforce the full compactness constraint for both chains , by keeping the term proportional to @xmath65 in eq ( [ doub6 ] ) .",
    "defining by @xmath66 , the total number of hp of the two interacting chains , we have @xmath67 technically , the extraction of the term proportional to @xmath68 in @xmath64 , amounts to keep on each site @xmath69 the terms proportional to @xmath70 in eqs.([doub6 ] ) and ( [ doub7 ] ) .",
    "we may therefore write @xmath71 where @xmath72 is given in eq ( [ doub4 ] ) and @xmath73 note that @xmath66 is still grand canonical with respect to the number @xmath74 of common bonds between the two hp , since , as mentionned above , the term with @xmath74 common bonds in @xmath66 yields a contribution proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "one may also interpret eq ( [ canon ] ) as giving the partition function of two hp of @xmath32 bonds , with an attractive interaction energy @xmath75 favoring common bonds , at temperature @xmath76 , that is @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "the identity between eqs.([canon ] ) and ( [ canon2 ] ) , i.e between @xmath66 and @xmath79 , yields the familiar result @xmath80 . moreover , equation ( [ canon2 ] ) allows us to derive bounds for the partition function @xmath79 ( or @xmath66 ) , namely @xmath81 where @xmath37 is given in eq ( [ meanfi ] ) .",
    "from now on , we will set @xmath82 .",
    "since an exact evaluation of eqs ( [ estim1],[estim2 ] ) seems to be out of reach , we will use a saddle point approximation with respect to the variables @xmath28 , @xmath58 , and @xmath83 .",
    "this saddle point will be further restricted to be space independent ( @xmath84 ) , again implying periodic boundary conditions .",
    "setting @xmath85 , we get @xmath86 where @xmath87    the saddle point equations are easily solved , by introducing the quantities @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . denoting the saddle point values with a subscript @xmath27",
    ", we obtain @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 together with @xmath93 . in eqs .",
    "( [ sad1]-[sad3 ] ) , the denominator is given by @xmath94 one then gets @xmath95    at this point , one has to resort to a numerical solution of the saddle point equations .",
    "note that the possible solutions obey simple equalities or inequalities , such as : @xmath96 .",
    "our results can be interpreted in two ways .",
    "they first describe the ( thermal ) properties of two hp coupled via eq ( [ canon2 ] ) : @xmath97 is then , up to a temperature factor , the free energy ( with @xmath98 ) .",
    "on the other hand , a legendre transformation with respect to @xmath99 , gives information on the number @xmath74 of common bonds between the hp , i.e. on their overlap properties . for convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath100 , and @xmath101 a saddle point evaluation of eq ( [ legend ] ) gives @xmath102 using eqs ( [ sad1]-[sad5 ] ) , we obtain @xmath103 we now present our results along both ways .",
    "unless otherwise specified , our results are given for @xmath104 , and the main parameter of this section is the temperature @xmath76 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the saddle point equations ( [ sad1]-[sad5 ] ) yield the free energy @xmath106 as a function of @xmath76 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "solving numerically the above equations , we get the following results    \\1 ) @xmath107    in this case , we find a finite fraction of common bonds @xmath108 .",
    "this value corresponds to a random choice of a common bond among the @xmath104 lattice dimensions , and is the smallest possible value @xmath2 of the overlap .",
    "\\2 ) @xmath109    one then has @xmath110 .",
    "this point is in some sense a disorder point @xcite where the values of @xmath111 ( linked to the entropy of a single hp ) and @xmath112 ( linked to the overlap of the two hp ) cross .",
    "it corresponds to an overlap @xmath113 .",
    "\\3 ) @xmath114 : the complete adsorption transition .    at this point ,",
    "the two hp system `` freezes '' into a single hp : one may also say that one chain gets fully adsorbed onto the other . of course",
    ", the entropy does not vanish below @xmath115 , but becomes equal to the entropy of a single hp , see eq ( [ meanfi ] ) .",
    "note that this solution is not a saddle point solution .",
    "it must nevertheless be taken into account , since its free energy per monomer which reads @xmath116 is an upper bound ( see eq ( [ bound ] ) ) . the transition temperature @xmath115 is thus defined by @xmath117 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the mecanism of this first order freezing transition is analogous to the one studied in ref.@xcite , in the context of polymer crystallization .",
    "note that @xmath1 jumps from @xmath118 to @xmath119 across the transition . from a thermodynamic point of view",
    ", we have thus found that the overlap fraction of two hp has a maximum value @xmath120 , beyond which the two hp coincide .",
    "note that , as the space dimension @xmath6 increases , the adsorption temperature @xmath115 decreases .",
    "in particular , the transition does not occur for the fully connected graph ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "\\4 ) in the present mean field like description , one may continue the high temperature branch of the free energy @xmath122 beyond the full adsorption point , implying the existence of a metastable state ( see the branch ab of figure [ fig1 ] ) . in this respect ,",
    "a particular temperature may be defined , where the entropy @xmath123 equals that of a single hp : @xmath124 leading to @xmath125 , and in turn to @xmath126 .",
    "furthermore , one may argue that this metastable branch is defined up to the point where the ( metastable ) overlap parameter @xmath1 reaches the value one .",
    "if this is correct , we find from the saddle point equation that this occurs for @xmath127 , with a positive entropy @xmath128 .",
    "we do not have a clear understanding of the metastable branch , and more work is needed on this point .",
    "as previously mentionned , our results can also be interpreted in terms of the overlap properties of the two hp .",
    "a convenient function to characterize these properties is the overlap probability distribution @xmath129 defined as @xmath130 where @xmath35 is given in eq ( [ meanfi ] ) and @xmath74 is the number of common bonds of the hp .",
    "eqs.([legend ] ) and ( [ distrib ] ) imply that @xmath131    from a strictly thermodynamic point of view , we have the result that the overlap probability distribution @xmath129 is defined only for @xmath132 , and for @xmath119 .",
    "the existence of a metastable branch beyond @xmath3 is not easy to interpret : the saddle point evaluation ( [ prop ] ) of the legendre transform ( [ legend ] ) then becomes ill - defined , since @xmath133 becomes a multivalued function .    for @xmath134",
    ", the relation between @xmath49 ( i.e. temperature ) and @xmath1 ( i.e. overlap ) can be inverted through eq ( [ prop ] ) .",
    "there is thus a one to one correspondance between overlap and temperature in the region @xmath135 .",
    "the thermal properties of the coupled system imply that , for @xmath136 , we have @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is given by eq ( [ prop2 ] ) . on the other hand , for @xmath139",
    ", we have @xmath140 .",
    "another quantity of interest is the entropy , considered as a function of the overlap @xmath1 .",
    "it is given by @xmath141 performing the saddle point evaluation on @xmath49 in eq ( [ legend ] ) , we get @xmath142 where @xmath143 is given by eq ( [ prop2 ] ) .",
    "the phase transition for @xmath144 can be interpreted ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) as a maxwell construction since the results of the previous section can be rewritten as @xmath145    beyond the homogeneous saddle point approximation , our results in the region @xmath146 are coherent with a phase coexistence picture between a fraction @xmath147 of the phase @xmath144 and a fraction @xmath148 of the fully adsorbed phase @xmath119",
    ". such a phase coexistence will give rise to an effective overlap @xmath149 .",
    "we have considered the overlap and/or thermal properties of two coupled hamiltonian paths ( hp ) , in a homogenous saddle point approximation . we have found ( for @xmath104 ) a phase transition at finite coupling , between an entropy dominated phase and a completely adsorbed phase , where the two hp have overlap @xmath119 .",
    "this phase transition disappears when @xmath121 .",
    "our results may be relevant in a proteic context ( nmr , structure alignement ) .",
    "if the number of constraints exceeds a certain threshold , the existence of @xmath3 suggests that a single spatial structure may survive . for longer polymers ,",
    "the existence of a first order transition , raises many questions ( metastability , glass transition , .. ) .",
    "finally , we remark that the coupled chains system of this paper undergoes a phase transition at a finite value of the coupling constant @xmath49 , whereas in spin glasses , the two replica system undergoes a ( spin glass ) transition when the coupling constant vanishes @xcite .",
