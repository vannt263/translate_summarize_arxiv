    "the degree of polarisation and its direction mainly depend on the size distribution , composition of the particles , phase angle and the wavelength of the incident solar radiation . however , the real situation is not that straight forward . in an attempt to study the detailed behaviour of polarisation with phase ,",
    "@xcite synthesized the polarisation observation data on 1p / halley by various researchers and derived curves of polarisation as a function of the phase angle .",
    "phase curve below about @xmath1 shows negative polarisation while it is positive at higher phase angles .",
    "they find slight modification in the polarisation phase curve as one moves away from the nucleus indicating the change in the nature of the dust particles . also an anomalously high transient polarisation was noted between october 17 and 30 , 1985 , at phase angle @xmath2 , attributed to sudden release of large number of smaller particles . on the basis of this work on 1p / halley",
    ", @xcite derived the physical properties of the dust grains indicating the presence of large particles - aggregates comprising of submicron sized grains , very rough and dark .",
    "these rather large grains are mixed with the clouds of small particles and they are usually responsible for almost all the polarisation effects in visible light , except during temporary specific dust release events ( as seen in case of 1p / halley during october 17 - 30 , 1985 ) by the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the complex behaviour of the dust is also seen in comet c/1995 ( hale - bopp ) , especially the region around the nucleus shows complex structure @xcite .",

    "issues related to the dust characteristics are adequately reviewed by @xcite .",
    "+ one of the main objective behind the study of comets is to understand the origin of the solar system .",

    "but the magnitude and the characteristics of the outburst occurred in comet 17p / holmes has dwarfed all the events seen earlier .",
    "the periodic comet 17p / holmes was discovered on november 6 , 1892 by e. holmes during a huge outburst which was followed by another similar event in january 1893 . when discovered , the comet was around five months past perihelion .",
    "the october 24 , 2007 outburst also occurred about six months after the perihelion passage ( may 4 , 2007 ) of the comet .",
    "the heliocentric distances of the comet at the time of the two outbursts were nearly similar ( 2.39 and 2.44 au respectively in 1892 and 2007 ) . during the outburst huge amount of dust and gas ejected out from the comet s sub - surface .",
    "comet 17p has typical composition as discussed by @xcite but the dust - to - gas ratio has been found very high on november 1 , 2007 @xcite and is attributed either due to the finite lifetimes of the gas molecules released at the onset of the outburst as compared to the long lived dust grains or due to a portion of the dust tail remaining within the photo - center apertures due to projection effects from the comet s small phase angle .    as discussed above ,",
    "polarisation studies have proven to be very useful in inferring the dust properties of comets .",
    "while the data at large phase angles are substantive , there is a lack of the observations at small phase angles which hinders study of the polarisation behaviour in the negative branch of polarisation - phase curve . in the past",
    "we have made detailed study on comets hale - bopp and wm1/linear at low phase angles @xcite . in the present communication we present results on the polarisation and photometric observations and discuss the brightness distribution across the coma and its evolution in the comet 17p / holmes during the period november 5 - 7 and december 13 , 2007 when the phase angle was near @xmath0 .",
    "we compare our observations with recently reported results on this comet by @xcite and also discuss polarisation behaviour with that of other comets observed at similar phase angles .",
    "photopolarimetric observations of comet 17p / holmes were made during the period november 5 - 7 and on december 13 , 2007 with a two channel photo polarimeter @xcite , which has been fully automated recently @xcite , mounted on the 1.2 m telescope of mt .",

    "rotating half plate rotates at discrete steps with 1 ms sampling time .",
    "one full rotation of half - wave plate is completed in 96 step and thus one modulation cycle involves 24 steps ( i.e. 24ms ) and the data are folded and accumulated in 24 bins . with the rapid modulation , the atmospheric scintillation effects ( eg .",

    "our observed polarisation values lie close to the best fit curves .",
    "these observations are suggestive of usual nature of the comet 17p / holmes .",

    "looking at figure [ wdep ] , we do not see , within the observed errors , any significant dependence of @xmath7 either on wavelength or on the aperture size .",
    "however , one can notice a mild trend of increase in @xmath7 ( decrease in the absolute value of polarisation ) on november 5 in the observation with 10 `` aperture and a mild decrease in @xmath7 on november 7 trough 20 '' aperture",
    ". this might indicate time evolution of the cometary grains . as discussed above the @xmath26-dependence of p%",
    "is to be taken cautiously .",
    "+ on october 25 , the polarisation is found to change from @xmath27 in 4845-band to @xmath28 in 6840-band while on october 27 and november 3 , the polarisation does not show any change with wavelength @xcite ; its value remaining at @xmath29 level .",
    "this has been attributed to the decrease in the number density of smaller particles .",
    "we also do not notice any significant change in polarisation with wavelength during nov 3 - 7 and on dec 13 , 2007 .",
    "however , @xcite have reported steep wavelength dependence of polarisation during the period october 27-november 22 , 2007 . the possible reason for this discrepancy",
    "is further discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "+      @xcite have reported the results based on the polarisation observations made during the period october 27-november 22 , 2007 . in the following we compare our observations with theirs and comment on the findings .    1 .   on november 5 , 2007(phase angle @xmath30 ) ,",
    "@xcite have reported p% in wrc filter while we observed in bc and rc bands .",

    "+ 2 .   using their observations in wrc(7228/1140 ) and",
    "bc(4845/65 ) bands on october 27 , 2007 , @xcite estimate large ( -0.77/1000 ) spectral gradient .",
    "though the spectral trend in the negative polarisation regime is not clearly established , they term it as atypical spectral behaviour not shown by normal comets . throughout our observations in rc and bc bands",
    ", we do not notice such atypical trend .",
    "based on their observations of relatively much lower absolute polarisation and atypical spectral behaviour , they claim comet 17p / holmes to be of unusual type which is contrary to our findings . in the light of this , we very carefully checked our observations for any systematic error , sky subtraction etc both for the comet and polarisation standard star observations .",
    "we find our results to be thoroughly consistent .",
    "the average degree of polarisation during november 5 - 7 is @xmath31 but on december 13 @xmath7 appears to go below -1.5% .",
    "these values are close to the values generally observed in other comets at such low phase angles , eg .",
    "comet halley @xcite , hale - bopp @xcite , linear wm1 @xcite .",
    "the data points lie close to the best fit ( p% vs @xmath10 curve ) , to further supporting the argument that 17p / holmes is a usual comet . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have made almost all their observations in broad bands(wrc , r , i ) .",
    "their only observation in bc narrow band on october 27 , 2007 gives polarisation value which is very close ( within @xmath32 ) to the typical phase - polarisation curve for comets(cf figure [ pp6840 ] ) and also agree with polarisation values obtained by us at later date .",
    "it is , therefore , very likely that the broad band continuum flux is contaminated by the gas emission , lowering the absolute value of the degree of polarisation .",
    "strong gas emission has been detected during the outburst of 17p / holmes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which supports the argument given above for the lower absolute value of the polarisation reported by @xcite .",
    "+ though the comet 17p / holmes has high dust - to - gas ratio , its abundance has typical composition @xcite .",
    "therefore , within the limitations of the observed polarisation data , it appears that 17p / holmes is similar to other typical comets and follows the average p% - @xmath10 curve at low phase angles ( ie @xmath33 ) .",
    "the gas production rates and the dust characteristics in 17p / holmes studied by others using narrow band photometry and spectroscopy indicate similarity between 17p / holmes and other typical comets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these further support the inference drawn in the present study on the basis of polarisation data .",

    "we have plotted normalized magnitudes @xmath34 ) which are corrected for extinction and instrumental effects and referred to a geocentric distance ( @xmath35 ) of 1au by subtracting the term 5log(@xmath35 ) . for comparison , energy distribution of a solar analog star(hd76151 ) , which was observed during the observing run , is also plotted .",
    "it is seen ( cf .",
    "figure [ sed ] ) that during the period november 5 - 7 , 2008 the comet colour is similar to the solar colour .",
    "however , on december 13 the colour is marginally bluer , indicating the increase in relative abundance of small particles .",
    "this can be explained assuming that in due course the larger particles might have fragmented to smaller particles thus enhancing the relative abundance of smaller particles .",
    "let us now discuss the light curve of comet 17p / holmes .",
    "figure [ light_curve ] shows the evolution of brightness in continuum bands through various size apertures , plotted in different panels .",
    "clearly there is decrease in brightness with time , but the interesting finding is the relative dimming in red band being more compared to blue band which is more apparent in 10 `` aperture . the brightness of central coma(10 '' ) has reduced by @xmath36 and 1 mag in red and blue wave band amounting to reduction by a factor of @xmath11 3.6 and 2.5 in respective bands .",
    "the mean spectrum is bluer on december 13 , 2007 compared to what is observed during november 5 - 7 , 2007 .",
    "observations on november 6 and december 13 are made through four apertures ( 10 `` , 20 '' , 26 `` , and 54 '' ) which allowed us to investigate the radial distribution of brightness .",
    "a simple approach is adopted to estimate the brightness at a particular radial distance from the nucleus ( the brightest point is taken as the nucleus ) .",
    "brightness in the annular region is estimated by subtracting brightness in successive apertures which is then normalized to one @xmath37 and this brightness is assigned to the mean annular distance between the two apertures .",
    "the radial brightness distribution thus obtained is plotted in figures [ rad_brightness_nov6 ] and [ rad_brightness_dec13 ] respectively . on november 6",
    ", the brightness in the inner region of the coma , as expected , is decreasing with radial distance , but beyond 12 arcsec from the nucleus it starts increasing , indicating the distribution of light to be non uniform .",
    "this might be due to the influence of some blob moving outward from the comet nucleus or a shocked region .",
    "such trend is not seen in december 13 data .",
    "compared to the brightness distribution on november 6 , it falls sharply close to the nucleus and then beyond 7 `` from nucleus , the decrease in the brightness is gradual .",
    "since we have carried out aperture photometry , it is difficult to precisely indicate the region of sharp and gradual fall in the brightness .",
    "there is a signature ( a kink ) in the brightness distribution on dec 13 which might be due to some arc or shocked region near 10 - 12 '' from the nucleus .",
    "@xcite have studied early motion ( ie october 26 , 2007 to november 20,2007 period ) of the outburst material with the ccd images in bvri bands which shows the second blob moving out from the nucleus .",
    "the november 5 , 2007 image of 17p / holmes @xcite shows a bright spot close to the nucleus ( cf .",
    "their figure 1 ) which might have faded later on .",
    "this might explain the rise in brightness seen in radial distribution on november 6 in our observations .",
    "this work reports on the linear polarisation and the brightness distribution observations in the coma of comet 17p / holmes at phase angle near 13 - 14@xmath38 , leading to the following conclusions :    * like other comets , 17p / holmes shows negative polarisation at low phase angle ( ie below @xmath16 ) . based on the polarisation values",
    ", we believe that 17p / holmes is not unusual comet as claimed by @xcite and the dust seems to be of the same nature as found in other comets .",
    "the discrepancy could possibly be due to the gas emission contamination in the broad band observations .",
    "+ * though there is indication that the value of polarisation decreases towards longer wavelength , we infer that , within the errors , the wavelength dependence of polarisation as observed through different sized apertures is typical of comets . + *",
    "radial distribution of brightness in the coma shows higher variation with time in the red wave band as compared to that in the blue wave band ; it has decreased by a factor of 3.6 and 2.5 respectively in red and blue bands indicating increase in the relative abundance of smaller dust particles away from the nucleus . +",
    "* radial brightness distribution shows the non - uniform distribution of material near the comet nucleus on november 6 which has gradually smoothened by december 13 .",
    "also the brightness distribution has become steeper from november 5 - 7 run to december 13 run .",
