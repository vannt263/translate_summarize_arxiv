    "we understand that if the maximum is attained at some point @xmath39 then at any time @xmath41 one can find another point @xmath42 where the maximum is attained .",

    "the horizontal propagation of maxima in @xmath50 requires two different perspectives .",
    "an almost immediate result follows from the structure of the nonlocal operator .",
    "more precisely , we show that _ strong maximum principle holds for pides involving nonlocal operators in the form ( [ nl_op ] ) whenever the whole domain ( not necessarily connected ) can be covered by translations of measure supports , starting from a maximum point .",

    "nevertheless , there are equations for which maxima do not propagate just by translating measure supports , such as pure nonlocal equations with nonlocal terms associated with the fractional laplacian , but whose measure supports are defined only on half space . _ mixed integro - differential equations _ , i.e. equations for which local diffusions occur only in certain directions and nonlocal diffusions on the orthogonal ones can not be handled by simple techniques , as they might be degenerate in both local or nonlocal terms but the overall behavior might be driven by their interaction ( the two diffusions can not cancel simultaneously ) .",
    "we have in mind equations of the type @xmath56 - \\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x_2 ^ 2}= 0 \\hbox { in } { \\mathbb{r}}^2\\times ( 0,t)\\ ] ] for @xmath57 .",
    "the diffusion term gives the ellipticity in the direction of @xmath58 , while the nonlocal term gives it in the direction of @xmath59 @xmath60 = \\int_{{\\mathbb{r } } } \\left(u(x_1+z_1,x_2)-u(x)-\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_1}(x)\\cdot z_1 1_{[-1,1]}(z_1)\\right)\\mu_{x_1}(dz_1)\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is a family of lvy measures .",

    "_    we then prove the local propagation of maxima in the cylindrical region @xmath63 $ ] and thus extend to parabolic integro - differential equations the results obtained by da lio in @xcite and bardi and da lio in @xcite and @xcite for fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic convex and concave hamilton jacobi operators .",
    "for helpful details of strong maximum principle results for hamilton jacobi equations we refer to @xcite .",
    "yet , it is worth mentioning that strong maximum principle for linear elliptic equations goes back to hopf in the 20s and to nirenberg , for parabolic equations @xcite .    in the last part we use strong maximum principle to prove a strong comparison result of viscosity sub and supersolution for integro - differential equations of the form ( [ epides ] ) with the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath64\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is a continuous function .",

    "following his work , existence and comparison results of solutions for _ first order pides _ were given by sayah in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "_ second - order degenerate pides _ are more complex and required careful studies , according to the nature of the integral operator ( often reflected in the singularity of the lvy measure against which they are integrated ) . when these equations involve _ bounded integral operators _ , general existence and comparison results for semi - continuous and unbounded viscosity solutions were found by alvarez and tourin @xcite .",

    "second order nonlocal operators _ were connected to backwards stochastic differential equations in @xcite and existence and comparison results were established .",
    "pham connected the optimal stopping time problem in a finite horizon of a controlled jump diffusion process with a parabolic pide in @xcite and proved existence and comparison principles of uniformly continuous solutions . existence and comparison results",
