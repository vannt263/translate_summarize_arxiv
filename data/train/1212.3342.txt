    "stars in orbit around the black hole in the center of the milky way , hereafter sgr  a@xmath0 , have been tracked for more than a decade , providing a measure of the black hole mass ( genzel et al .",
    "2010 ; ghez et al .",
    "the constraints have been steadily improving with the first measurement of a fully closed orbit for the star s2 ( see , e.g. , ghez et al .",
    "2008 ; gillessen et al .",
    "2009 ) as well as with the discovery of additional stars ( s0 - 16 , s0 - 102 and s0 - 104 ) in orbits that probe the black - hole spacetime within a few thousand gravitational radii ( meyer et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "precise astrometric observations of stars in close orbits around sgr  a@xmath0  may lead to the detection of orbital precession due to general relativistic frame dragging , measuring the spin of the black hole , and testing the no - hair theorem ( will 2008 )",
    ". such measurements will be complementary to those that will be achieved with the event horizon telescope ( fish & doeleman 2009 ; johannsen & psaltis 2010 ) as well as to timing observations of pulsars in orbit around the black hole ( pfahl & loeb 2004 ; liu et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "future instruments , such as gravity , an adaptive - optics assisted interferometer on the vlt ( eisenhauer et al .",
    "2011 ) , will track stellar orbits with a single pointing astrometric accuracy of @xmath2arcsec , for stars as faint as @xmath3 in a crowded field ( stone et al .",
    "2012 ) . at this resolution ,",
    "the biggest challenge in measuring the fundamental properties of sgr  a@xmath0  with stellar orbits will be ensuring that a particular measurement is not affected adversely by astrophysical complications .",
    "a number of studies have explored the effects of non - gravitational forces exerted on the orbiting stars by other objects in the same environment .",
    "merritt et al  ( 2010 ) and sadeghian & will ( 2011 ) investigated the perturbative effects of the stellar cluster on the orbits of individual stars and found that they are negligible compared to the general relativistic effects inside @xmath41  mpc@xmath5 gravitational radii .",
    "psaltis ( 2012 ) studied the interaction of the orbiting stars with the ambient gas and showed that hydrodynamic drag and star - wake interactions are negligible inside @xmath6  gravitational radii .    in this paper , we study the deviations of the stellar orbits from test - particle trajectories that are introduced by the fact that stars are not point particles but _",
    "( i ) _ may lose mass in strong winds and _ ( ii ) _ may be tidally deformed .",
    "we calculate the range of orbital parameters for which orbital perturbations due to the stellar winds and tides do not preclude the measurement of the black - hole spin and quadrupole moment and , therefore , testing of the no - hair theorem .",
    "we start by comparing the characteristic timescales for orbital precession due to general relativistic effects to those of orbital perturbations due to stellar winds and to tidal forces .",
    "hereafter , we set the mass of the black hole to @xmath7 and its distance to 8.4  kpc .",
    "we also denote by @xmath8 the mass of the black hole , by @xmath9 the mass of the star , and by @xmath10 and @xmath11 the semi - major axis and eccentricity of the stellar orbit . with these definitions ,",

    "first , eccentric orbits precess on the orbital plane ( periapsis precession ) .",
    "the characteristic timescale for this precession is ( merritt et al .",
    "2010 ) @xmath13    second , orbits with angular momenta that are not parallel to the spin angular momentum of the black hole precess because of frame dragging .",

    "if the spacetime of the black hole satisfies the no hair theorem , then @xmath18 .",
    "the three timescales for a spinning kerr black hole ( @xmath19 , @xmath18 ) and for orbits with two different eccentricities are shown in figure  1 as a function of the orbital semi - major axis .",
    "the angular momentum of a star in orbit around the black hole is @xmath20 ( assuming here for simplicity a circular orbit ) .",
    "if the star is losing mass in a wind at a rate @xmath21 , then its orbit will evolve according to @xmath22 assuming that the wind is carrying a fraction @xmath23 of the orbital angular momentum , i.e. , @xmath24 then the rate of change of the orbital separation becomes @xmath25 in other words , the timescale for orbital evolution due to the presence of the wind is @xmath26 \\frac{m_{\\rm s}}{\\dot{m}_{\\rm w}}\\;,\\ ] ] or @xmath27 where we have used the subscript `` -7 '' to denote the exponent in the wind mass loss rate .",
    "this characteristic timescale is compared to the dynamical timescales in figure  1 , for a @xmath28 star and for a wind mass - loss rate of @xmath29  yr@xmath30 , which is consistent with current observations of the star s2 in orbit around sgr  a@xmath0  ( martins et al .",
    "the effect of wind mass loss becomes negligible with respect to the frame - dragging induced precession of the orbital planes for orbits within @xmath31 gravitational radii . on the other hand",
    ", they become negligible with respect to the quadrupole induced precession of the orbital planes for orbits within @xmath32 gravitational radii .",
    "the tidal deformations excited at each periastron passage transfer some of the orbital energy into modes within the volume of the star ( see alexander 2006 for a review of stellar processes around sgr  a@xmath0 ) .",
    "since the orbital energy loss is proportional to the number of passages ( li & loeb 2012 ) , we can use the approach of press & teukolsky ( 1977 ) to estimate the rate of dissipation of orbital energy as @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the periastron distance , @xmath35 is the radius of the star , and @xmath36 are appropriate dimensionless functions of the quantity @xmath37 that describe the excitation of modes with different spherical harmonic index @xmath38 .    in detail , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mode order and @xmath41 is the other spherical harmonic index .",
    "the excited modes have @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath44 represents the coupling to the orbit , @xmath45^{l+1 } \\rm{exp } \\{i [ \\omega_n t + m { \\phi ( t ) } ] \\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the instantaneous distance between the star and sgr  a@xmath0 , @xmath47 is the mode frequency , @xmath48 is the true anomaly , and @xmath49 ^{1/2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad \\left[2^l\\frac{(l - m)}{2}!\\frac{(l+m)}{2}!\\right]^{-1}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the tidal overlap integral @xmath50 represents the coupling of the tidal potential to a given mode , i.e. , @xmath51\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the stellar density profile as a function of radius @xmath53 and @xmath54 y_{lm } ( \\theta , \\phi ) $ ] is the mode eigenfunction , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 being its radial and poloidal components , respectively .",
    "we obtain the appropriate stellar density profile from the mesa code ( paxton et al .",
    "2011 ) and compute the mode eigenfunctions with the adipls code ( christensen - dalsgaard 2008 ) .    because the energy gain in each passage depends on @xmath57 and the values of @xmath50 and @xmath44 are similar for modes with different values of @xmath38 , the quadrupole ( @xmath58 ) modes gain the most energy during the tidal excitation ( the @xmath59 and @xmath60 modes are not excited ) .",
    "for this reason , we focus , hereafter , on the @xmath58 modes .",
    "the characteristic timescale for orbital evolution due to tidal dissipation is @xmath61 and is shown in figure  [ fig : tides ] for two main - sequence stars with masses @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "if the star at periastron reaches inside the tidal radius @xmath64 it gets disrupted .",
    "for simplicity , we ignore here the fact that , if the periastron distance is smaller than @xmath65 times the tidal radius , the repeated heating of the star at each passage will make it vulnerable to tidal disruption ( li & loeb 2012 ) . requiring @xmath66 sets a lower limit on the semi - major axis of the stellar orbit , i.e. , @xmath67 the tidal limit is shown as the vertical portion of the red lines in figure  [ fig : tides ] . at orbital separations larger than this limit , the tidal evolution of the stellar orbits is never fast enough to compete with the precession of the orbital planes due to frame dragging . on the other hand ,",
    "the orbital plane precession due to the quadrupole moment of the black hole for stars with semi - major axes a few times larger than the tidal limit will be masked by the orbital evolution due to tidal effects .",
    "we explored whether deviations of the orbits of star around sgr  a@xmath0from test particle trajectories due to stellar winds and tides may compromise the measurements of relativistic effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : orbits ] summarizes our results for an illustrative case of a @xmath28 star and a black - hole spin of @xmath19 .",
    "the two blue curves in this figure show the combinations of semi - major axes and orbital eccentricities for which the timescale of orbital plane precession due to the quadrupole moment of the black hole is equal to the orbital evolution timescale due to the wind - mass loss ( @xmath68 ) and due to tides ( @xmath69 ) . in order for a stellar orbit not to be affected significantly by either of the two effects ,",
    "its parameters need to be in between the two curves .    for comparison",
    ", we calculate the signal - to - noise ratio at which the precession of the orbital plane of a star due to frame dragging will be detected , in the near future , using the adaptive - optics assisted interferometer gravity . following weinberg et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we write the signal - to - noise ratio as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the distance to the black hole , @xmath72 is the number of orbits monitored , @xmath73 is the inclination of the orbit , and @xmath74 is the astrometric accuracy of each measurement . assuming that we monitor a particular orbit for a time @xmath75 , we can rewrite this expression as @xmath76 the astrometric accuracy of gravity is expected to be @xmath77arcsec for a faint star of @xmath78 and @xmath79arcsec for a brighter star of @xmath80 . requiring a signal - to - noise ratio of 5 for this range of astrometric accuracies and for the typical parameters used in the above equation places an upper limit on the semi - major axes of orbits as a function of their eccentricity .",
    "this range of upper limits is shown as the blue - shaded region in figure  [ fig : orbits ] .",
    "for all but the most eccentric orbits for which gravity will be able to detect orbital - plane precession due to frame dragging , both effects of stellar winds and tides do not preclude by themselves the measurement of the quadrupole moment of the black hole .",
    "on the other hand , for highly eccentric orbits ( @xmath1 ) , the tidal dissipation of orbital energy for massive stars occurs at similar timescales as the orbital - plane precession due to the quadrupole moment of the black hole . as a result",
    ", it needs to be taken into account as a possible source of systematic uncertainties in measuring the quadrupole moment of the black hole and in testing the no - hair theorem .",
