    "the bak  sneppen ( bs ) model of biological evolution has been introduced in @xcite to study self - organised critical behaviour in populations with natural selection and spatial interactions . in the model",
    ", a population is spread out over a circle so that each species has exactly two neighbours , and each site is assigned a numerical parameter between zero and one that describes the _ fitness _ of the species at that particular site .",
    "the system evolves according to the following discretetime dynamics : at each time step the species with the smallest fitness parameters becomes extinct and is replaced by a new species whose fitness parameter becomes independent uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath0 $ ] . to take into account interactions between species , e.g.  competition for resources or predatorprey relations , the fitness parameters of the two neighbours of the least fit species",
    "are also reset to random values .",
    "this represents the idea that the fitness is not just a fixed property of a species but also depends on its environment . even though this is a very rudimentary model for evolution it does possess some of the characteristic features thought to be associated with evolving biological systems , including longrange dependence and evolutionary activity on all time scales ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite for a discussion in the context of selforganised criticality .    despite its apparently easy definition ,",
    "the bs model has withstood most attempts at mathematical analysis in the past .",
    "partial results have been obtained , however , in the context of rankdriven processes and meanfield approximations @xcite .",
    "early on it was conjectured based on simulations that the fitness distribution at a fixed site converges , in the limit of large populations , to a uniform distribution on the interval @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 .",
    "there are only few rigorous results about the original bs model ; in @xcite it is proved that the expected fitness at a fixed site in the stationary regime is bounded away from unity uniformly in the size of the population ; @xcite gives a conditional characterization of the limiting distribution in terms of a set of critical thresholds ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we suggest a novel approach to determining the stationary fitness distribution in the bs model with a finite number of species .",
    "the method consists of translating the evolutionary dynamics into a set of linear recurrence equations for the coefficients of the densities of the finitetime distributions and analysing the asymptotic properties of these recursive equations .",
    "we apply the method to derive the asymptotic fitness distribution in the bs model with four species , which is given by ( [ theorem - asympdist4 ] ) @xmath3{\\boldsymbol{1}}_{[0,1]^4}({\\boldsymbol{x}}){\\mathrm{d}}^4{\\boldsymbol{x}}.\\ ] ]    it has been suggested that a similar , and potentially easier , analysis can be applied to the anisotropic bak ",
    "sneppen ( abs ) model ; in this variation of the model the evolutionary dynamics are modified so that the fitness parameter of only one neighbour , say the right one , is updated at each time step together with the fitness parameter of the least fit species . while many qualitative properties are believed to be shared by the original and the anisotropic bs , analytical considerations and numerical calculations indicate that they fall in different universality classes , and have thus different critical exponents @xcite .",
    "our method can be applied to the abs . in the first nontrivial case of three species the asymptotic fitness distribution follows from computations which are very similar to those leading to [ theorem - asympdist4 ] , and",
    "is given by @xmath4{\\boldsymbol{1}}_{[0,1]^3}({\\boldsymbol{x}}){\\mathrm{d}}^3{\\boldsymbol{x}}.\\ ] ] the complexity of the calculations for larger populations seems to be increasing at a similar rate as in bs and studying abs does therefore not , for the purpose of understanding the method we propose in the current paper , offer major advantages over the original model .",

    "we present one of several possible , precise definitions of the bs model in terms of a markov chain , and use this representation to derive qualitative properties for arbitrary population sizes .",
    "we then turn to the special case of the fourspecies model in [ section - n4 ] , where we derive the full asymptotic fitness distribution .",
