    "in central au+au collisions at rhic , electrons from heavy quark ( charm and bottom ) decays have been observed to be suppressed to a similar level as light hadrons  @xcite .",
    "it is of great interest to separate non - photonic electron energy loss into the contributions from charm and bottom quarks .",
    "since the near - side e - h azimuthal correlation from b decays is much wider than that from d decays for the same electron @xmath3 , star s previous study  @xcite compared the experimental correlation results in p+p collisions with pythia simulations , and found a substantial b contribution to non - photonic electrons up to electron @xmath4 gev/@xmath2 . in this work , we extend this measurement to @xmath1 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "when high-@xmath3 partons lose a significant amount of energy through the dense qcd medium created in central cu+cu or au+au collisions , their azimuthal correlations with low-@xmath3 hadrons are modified accordingly , showing a broad or even double - peak structure on the away - side di - hadron correlation  @xcite .",
    "non - photonic electrons represent well the directions of the mother d or b mesons when electron @xmath5 3 gev/@xmath2 , and in the opposite direction we expect another heavy quark traversing the medium leaving an imprint on the away - side e - h correlation .",
    "this study of the correlated hadron azimuthal distribution from heavy quark energy loss in the dense qcd medium will provide insight on the mechanism responsible for the correlation pattern and the flavor dependence .",
    "cu+cu and au+au collisions have very different system sizes , and enable us to have a systematic study on the system - size dependence of the non - photonic e - h correlation .",
    "this study is based on star events with high - tower triggers at 200 gev : 0.7 million p+p events in run vi , 1 million @xmath6 most central cu+cu events in run v , and 0.2 million @xmath6 au+au events in run vii .",
    "tracks of charged particles are reconstructed by the star tpc  @xcite . to enhance the statistics for high @xmath3 electrons",
    ", the high - tower trigger requires that at least one track is projected into the star bemc and its smd  @xcite , with the energy deposition above a threshold in a single tower of the bemc .",
    "the high - tower thresholds are @xmath7 gev ( p+p ) , @xmath8 gev ( cu+cu ) and @xmath9 gev ( au+au ) . the pseudorapidity ( @xmath10 ) coverage in this study is @xmath11 for cu+cu , and @xmath12 for p+p and au+au collisions , to avoid the large photon conversion background for @xmath13 .",
    "the centrality definition used is the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "electron identification was carried out by combining the ionization energy loss in the tpc with the energy deposition in the bemc and the shower profile in the smd .",
    "( see details in @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "the dominant photonic electron background is from photon conversions and @xmath14 , @xmath10 dalitz decays , where electron pairs have small invariant masses .",
    "we pair up the electron candidates with tracks passing a very loose cut on @xmath15e@xmath16 around the electron band , and examine the @xmath17-@xmath18 invariant mass distribution of electron pairs with opposite signs ( @xmath19 ) , by ignoring the opening angle @xmath20 to eliminate the tracking resolution effects  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 electron sample contains the true photonic background as well as the combinatorial background estimated by the same - sign pairs ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "a cut of mass @xmath22 gev/@xmath23 rejects most photonic background .    to study the angular correlation of non - photonic electrons and charged hadrons , we start with the semi - inclusive electron sample ( @xmath24-@xmath25 ) , which is everything in the inclusive electron sample except for the @xmath19 with the mass cut .",
    "the latter term contains the reconstructed photonic electrons and the @xmath26 , or the @xmath21 with the mass cut .",
    "the correlation signal is then obtained by the equation @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the photonic electron reconstruction efficiency , and @xmath30 denotes the reconstructed photonic electron azimuthal correlations with charged hadrons after removing the photonic partners .",
    "the efficiency @xmath29 was estimated from simulations to be @xmath31 for p+p , @xmath32 for cu+cu , and @xmath33 for au+au .",
    "the details on the approach via @xmath24-@xmath25 can be found in @xcite .",
    "fig .  1 shows the b contribution to non - photonic electrons as a function of electron @xmath3 for 200 gev p+p collisions , where the open stars represent the results from run v data  @xcite and the full stars , run vi data . each point in fig .",
    "1 was obtained from the azimuthal correlation between the non - photonic electron with the corresponding @xmath3 and the charged hadrons with @xmath34 gev/@xmath2 , after we fit the near side correlation with pythia simulations .",
    "( see the fitting recipe in @xcite . )",
    "the systematical errors come from photonic electron reconstruction efficiency , different fitting ranges and different fitting functions .",
    "the solid curves show the range of relative bottom contribution from recent pqcd calculations ( fonll )  @xcite gev/@xmath23 , @xmath35 gev/@xmath23 and @xmath36 ( for the central value of the range ) . ] .",
    "preliminary star data are consistent with the fonll calculations , and show almost the same b and d contributions to non - photonic electrons for @xmath37 gev/@xmath2 . together with the observed suppresion of non - photonic electrons in central au+au collisions , the measured @xmath38 ratios imply that bottom may be suppressed in central au+au collisions at rhic , assuming the initial ratio is similar in au+au as in p+p .     for 200gev p+p collisions .",
