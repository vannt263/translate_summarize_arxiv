    "polarization rotation measurements have been achieved using a number of optical configurations including the standard partially crossed polarizers ( pcp ) , a variety of optical bridges @xcite , and most recently modified sagnac interferometers @xcite .",
    "here we compare and contrast these techniques in terms of their ultimate theoretical and practical sensitivities to nanoradian polarization rotations , and also in terms of their ability to distinguish rotations arising in media which break or preserve time and/or parity symmetries . in order to compare their respective sensitivities ,",
    "simple expressions are given for the root - mean - square ( rms ) noise , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and a figure - of - merit ( fom ) defined as the squared snr per unit bandwidth .",
    "the validity of these expressions is demonstrated experimentally by performing faraday rotation ( @xmath4 ) measurements in the pcp , bridge and sagnac geometries on a terbium gallium garnet ( tgg ) rod exposed to a small , time varying magnetic field . by changing the amplitude of the oscillating magnetic field ,",
    "faraday rotations from 38 @xmath8rad down to 3 nrad are explored , and it will be shown that thanks to a large bridge to pcp source noise rejection ratio , the bridge is the preferred method to achieve nanoradian rotation measurements in the shot noise limit .",
    "although rotations arising from @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 phenomena are not experimentally considered , the results obtained here concerning the fom are applicable to these cases .    although the sagnac interferometer will be shown to have a lower fom than either pcp or the optical bridge , it is capable ( in a single measurement ) of discriminating between rotations arising from different phenomena with different time and/or spatial symmetries @xcite .",
    "sagnacs have been used to discriminate the magneto - optical effect ( @xmath4 ) from rotations due to linear birefringence ( @xmath6 ) @xcite and since then the use of sagnac interferometers in magneto - optics @xcite has become synonymous with the effort to experimentally discriminate between reciprocal ( @xmath2 ) from non - reciprocal ( @xmath9 ) phenomena that result in polarization rotations .",
    "using the constraints imposed on the form of the jones matrix by the time and spatial symmetries of the optical medium @xcite , it is shown here that a range of modified sagnac interferometers exist which can be configured to be sensitive to rotations arising from only one of the @xmath6 , @xmath4 , @xmath7 or @xmath5 symmetric media .",

    "however , reducing @xmath17 reduces the absolute value of the shot noise snr so obtaining a shot noise limited measurement in this way is not generally recommended .",
    "figure [ configs](b ) shows the modified sagnac interferometer that will be considered ( and implemented ) here .",
    "it is a static version of the loop employed elsewhere @xcite in which the static faraday rotator replaces an electro - optic modulator .",
    "while this has consequences for the sensitivity of the loop to rotations other than faraday ( @xmath4 ) rotations ( see section [ sagnacgeometries ] ) , the principal role of these elements is to impose a particular analysis angle , @xmath25 .",
    "this becomes apparent when the jones matrix calculation is carried out for the clockwise ( cw ) and counter - clockwise ( ccw ) beams circulating in the sagnac loop .",
    "consider first the cw beam .",
    "the jones vector due to the cw beam ( blue arrow in fig .",

    "the non - polarizing beam splitter ( bs ) is represented by four separate jones matrices corresponding to transmission from an input port to an output port ( @xmath45 ) , reflection from an input port to an output port ( @xmath46 ) , reverse transmission ( i.e. from an output port to an input port , @xmath47 ) , and reverse reflection ( i.e. from an output port to an input port , @xmath48 ) .",
    "these matrices were determined experimentally and are given in appendix [ jones ] . in this interferometer",
    "the bs is outside the sagnac loop and serves only to redirect the interfering light to the detector .",
    "the second component outside the sagnac loop is a linear polarizer aligned at 45 degrees to the x - axis , @xmath49 . with respect to the axes of the polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) that forms the sagnac loop , this polarizer results in equal powers circulating in the cw and ccw directions",
    "this is because the pbs reflects ( transmits ) only the y - component ( x - component ) of the incident face . in the case of the reflection",
    "this is represented by @xmath22 while transmission through the pbs is given by @xmath50 .",
    "two quarter wave plates are placed in the loop with their fast axes aligned at 45 degrees to the x - axis , @xmath51 , so that in the sagnac loop between these waveplates the light circulates in a circularly polarized state .",
    "the variable ( but static ) faraday rotator rotates the cw light polarization through an angle @xmath52 according to @xmath53 where @xmath25 will turn out to be the same analysis angle used in the description of the pcp .",
    "the sample itself causes a rotation @xmath0 described by @xmath54 .",
    "there are a number of subtle points to note .",
    "firstly , the mirrors shown in fig.[configs](b ) were ignored in eq .",
    "[ cw ] . this can be done in a free - space ( i.e. mirrored ) sagnac for an _ even _ number of mirrors as long as the light is approximately normally incident on each mirror i.e. far from the brewster angle .",
    "the jones matrix , @xmath55 , for an ideal mirror and an incident angle far from the brewster angle , is given in appendix [ jones ] , from which it can be seen that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath58 identity matrix .",
    "[ cw ] is strictly correct for a fibered loop which contains no mirrors .",
    "secondly , when the light passes through optical components via their back face , the jones matrix needs to be modified by transposing it @xcite .",
    "furthermore since the coordinate axis system is defined in the reference frame of the light and not the laboratory , a rotation of the jones matrix about the y - axis by @xmath59 radians is required ( given by the operator , @xmath60 ) .",
    "if the optical component in question is reciprocal then no further operation is required , whereas for non - reciprocal components the sign of the off diagonal elements of the jones matrix must be reversed @xcite .",
    "thus the term @xmath61 in eq .",
    "[ cw ] , where the superscript @xmath62 refers to the transpose operation , corresponds to the retransmission of the light through the polarizer , p , after exiting the sagnac loop . in the same way",
    "@xmath63 corresponds to the backwards transmission of the cw light through the pbs .",
    "the same treatment , included here for completeness , can be given for the ccw propagating beam ( red arrow in fig .",
    "[ configs](b ) ) : @xmath64 where the changes to the reciprocal waveplates and the non - reciprocal faraday rotations are the result of the operations required for a reversal of the light propagation outlined immediately above and described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "notice in particular that the faraday rotation due to the sample is described by @xmath65 i.e. a rotation in the opposite direction to that experienced by the cw beam . at first sight",
    "this seems surprising since the sign of the faraday rotation depends only on the direction of the sample magnetization ( which has not changed ) .",
    "however , the sample magnetization does not change in the laboratory reference frame , whereas it _ has _ changed sign in the reference frame of the light ( i.e. for cw and ccw beams ) .    the resultant jones vector describing the interference on the detector is then found by summing eq . [ cw ] and eq .",
    "the modulus squared of this vector gives the detected light intensity : @xmath66 whose angular dependence is identical to malus result found for the pcp ( eq . [ malus ] ) .",
    "the reduction in detected intensity by a factor of 8 relative to pcp results from the loss of photons at the beam splitters .",
    "the mo signal on the sagnac is therefore also a factor of 8 smaller than for pcp : @xmath67 although its functional dependence on @xmath25 and @xmath0 are identical . since the rms source noise in eq .",
    "[ pcpsource ] is linear in @xmath17 , the source noise in the sagnac is also reduced by a factor of 8 and the source noise snr is identical to that of the pcp ( see eq .",
    "[ pcpsourcesnr ] ) . on the other hand , the rms shot noise , eq .",
    "[ pcpshot ] varies as @xmath42 so that it becomes @xmath68 such that the shot noise limited snr in the sagnac is @xmath69 a factor of @xmath70 smaller than the pcp . for a given laser source intensity , @xmath17",
    ", the sagnac snr will therefore be smaller than the pcp in the shot noise limit .",
    "if the measurement is source noise limited , the snr for the pcp and sagnac will , in principal , be identical . as will be discussed in section [ sagnacgeometries ] ,",
    "sagnac interferometers also differ from pcp in that their symmetry can be adapted to polarization rotations arising from optical phenomena with specific time and spatial symmetries .",
    "the linear analyzer in the pcp is replaced by a pbs in the optical bridge as shown in fig .",
    "[ configs](c ) . as such ,",
    "both the x- and y - components of the light transmitted through the sample are used . with",
    "the two photodiode detectors connected back - to - back , the resulting output signal is proportional to their difference intensity . for a faraday rotation @xmath0 ,",
    "the jones vector of the x - channel light is @xmath71 , while that on the y - channel is @xmath26 .",
    "the difference of the squared modulus of each of these vectors gives the output of the optical bridge : @xmath72 as in the case of the pcp and the sagnac , the mo signal is then obtained by reversing the magnetization of the sample to obtain a faraday rotation of @xmath73 , yielding a bridge output of @xmath74 .",
    "the difference in the responses for faraday rotations of @xmath35 is the mo signal : @xmath75    since the optical source noise on each of the detectors is correlated , it is ( partially ) removed during the difference measurement on the optical bridge .",
    "it is therefore the difference intensity on the bridge , given by eq .",
    "[ bridgeoutput ] for a rotation of @xmath76 , which is relevant for the source noise calculation rather than the individual intensities on each detector .",
