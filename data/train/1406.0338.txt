    "a class of graph is _ @xmath4-bounded _ if there is a function @xmath5 such that every graph @xmath3 in the class satisfies @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the chromatic number and @xmath8 is the clique number of @xmath3 .",
    "it is well known that the class of all graphs is not @xmath4-bounded  @xcite .",
    "gyrfs  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) conjectured that for any tree @xmath0 , the class of graphs that do not contain @xmath0 as an induced subgraph is @xmath4-bounded .",
    "this conjecture is still open , but scott proved the following topological variant in 1997 @xcite : for any tree @xmath0 , the class of graphs that do not contain any subdivision of @xmath0 as an induced subgraph is @xmath4-bounded .",
    "scott conjectured that the same property should hold whether @xmath0 is a tree or not .",
    "on the other hand , it is easy to see that gyrfs s conjecture is false if @xmath0 contains a cycle as there are graphs of arbitrarily high girth ( ensuring no copy of @xmath0 appears ) and high chromatic number  @xcite .    for any @xmath1 , the class of graphs excluding all subdivisions of @xmath1 as an induced subgraph is @xmath4-bounded .",
    "a _ @xmath9-subdivision _ of a ( multi)graph @xmath3 is a graph obtained from @xmath3 by subdividing each edge at least @xmath10 times , i.e. replacing every edge of @xmath3 by a path on at least @xmath11 edges .",
    "a recent result @xcite ( see @xcite for a follow - up ) shows that scott s conjecture is false whenever @xmath1 is a @xmath12-subdivision of a non - planar graph .",
    "the proof is based on a construction of a family of triangle - free intersection graphs of segments in the plane with unbounded chromatic number ( the existence of such graphs also disproved a conjecture of erds ) . since no @xmath12-subdivision of a non - planar graph can be represented as the intersection of arcwise connected sets in the plane ( in particular , such subdivisions can not be represented as an intersection graph of line segments ) no such graph appears as an induced subgraph in the construction .",
    "therefore , graphs in the construction exclude all subdivisions of 1-subdivisions of non - planar graphs as induced subgraphs . hence , the 1-subdivision of any non - planar graph is a counterexample to scott s conjecture .",
    "recently , walczak  @xcite showed how to slightly modify the construction of @xcite to obtain a family of graphs with no stable sets of linear size ( in particular , with unbounded fractional chromatic number ) .",
    "therefore , the following stronger result can be deduced : for any non - planar graph @xmath1 , there exist graphs with no @xmath12-subdivision of @xmath1 as an induced subgraph , and with no stable sets of linear size .",
    "note that the construction of @xcite gives the same family of graphs as a construction of burling @xcite , who proved in 1965 that triangle - free intersection graphs of axis - parallel boxes in @xmath13 have unbounded chromatic number .",
    "our original goal was to characterize _ all _ graphs @xmath1 such that no subdivision of @xmath1 appears as an induced subgraph in the construction of @xcite ( this extended set of graphs would then provide new counterexamples to scott s conjecture @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , our characterization is incomplete but we still provide new counterexamples to scott s conjecture . on the other hand , we are able to give a complete characterization of all graphs @xmath1 that are a @xmath14-subdivision of some multigraph , and such that no subdivision of @xmath1 appears as an induced subgraph in the construction .",
    "a consequence of pawlik _ et al . _",
    "s result @xcite is that scott s conjecture is false for any graph obtained from @xmath15 by subdividing every edge at least once .",
    "we show that scott s conjecture is also false for any graph obtained from @xmath2 by subdividing every edge at least once .",
    "note that proving that scott s conjecture holds for any subdivision of @xmath16 is equivalent to a long standing conjecture of gyrfs  @xcite , which remains open .",
    "we also prove that if @xmath3 is a 2-connected multigraph with no vertex intersecting every cycle of @xmath3 , then any graph obtained from @xmath3 by subdividing every edge at least twice is a counterexample to scott s conjecture . as our focus is on the construction",
    ", we do not prove scott s conjecture is true for any particular graph , only that it can not be proven false using the construction in some cases .",
    "our proof uses the following remarkable aspect of pawlik _ et al . _",
    "s @xcite proof ( see also @xcite ) : the graphs in the construction can be obtained not only as intersection graphs of segments in the plane , but also as intersection of a wide range of arcwise connected shapes in the plane . in this paper",
    ", we will use the fact that graphs in the construction can be represented as restricted frame graphs ( see section  [ sec : rbg ] for the definition ) .    instead of focusing on the construction",
    ", we will focus on triangle - free graphs @xmath1 such that no subdivision of @xmath1 can be represented as a restricted frame graph .",
    "these subdivisions do not appear as induced subgraphs in the construction , so it follows that such graphs @xmath1 are counterexamples to scott s conjecture .",
    "it turns out that graphs in the modified construction of walczak  @xcite can be obtained from graphs in pawlik _",
    "_ s construction @xcite by adding twins .",
    "as the class of restricted frame graphs is stable by the operation of twin addition ( see remark  [ rem : twin ] ) , the graphs @xmath1 we find are also counterexamples to a weaker version of scott s conjecture , where the chromatic number is replaced by the fractional chromatic number .    in section  [ sec : tfreerbg ] , we characterize connected triangle - free graphs without _ full star cutsets _ ( defined in that section ) which are restricted frame graphs . among other consequences",
    ", this characterization directly implies that scott s conjecture is also false for any graph @xmath1 obtained from @xmath2 by subdividing every edge at least once .",
    "it also implies that scott s conjecture is false for any graph @xmath1 which is a @xmath14-subdivision of a 2-connected multigraph @xmath3 with no vertex contained in all cycles .",
    "we investigate these @xmath14-subdivisions in more details in section  [ sec:2sub ] , where we show that for every multigraph @xmath3 , either all @xmath14-subdivisions of @xmath3 can be represented as restricted frame graphs , or none of them can ( and it can be determined in linear time whether @xmath3 satisfies the former or the latter property ) .",
    "while it might seem restrictive to study graphs that can not be represented as restricted frame graphs ( instead of graphs that do not appear in the construction ) , it can be proven that in the case of @xmath17-subdivisions of multigraphs , this is not restrictive at all : for every multigraph @xmath3 , if some @xmath18-subdivision @xmath1 of @xmath3 can be represented as a restricted frame graph , then @xmath1 appears as an induced subgraph in the construction of pawlik _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and in the modified construction of walczak  @xcite .",
    "so the construction can be thought of as _ universal _ for @xmath18-subdivisions of restricted frame graphs .",
    "details about the construction and this final result are given in appendix  [ sec : cons ] .",
    "as stated in the introduction , our proof relies on the analysis of the following class of graphs .",
    "an _ axis - parallel box _ in @xmath19 is the cartesian product of two intervals of @xmath20 .",
    "frame _ is the boundary of an axis - parallel box in @xmath19 .",
    "[ def : rbg ] a graph @xmath3 is a _ restricted frame graph _ if it is the intersection graph of a family of frames with these restrictions ( see figure  [ fig : inter ] for the only allowed intersection ) .",
    "1 .   corners of a frame do not coincide with any point of another frame , 2 .",
    "the left side of any frame does not intersect any other frame , 3 .   if the right side of a frame intersects a second frame , this right side intersects both the top and bottom of this second frame , and 4 .",
    "if two frames have non - empty intersection , then no frame is ( entirely ) contained in the intersection of the regions bounded by the two frames .",
    "a _ representation _ of a restricted frame graph  @xmath3 is a set of frames @xmath21 where each @xmath22 is a frame and such that these frames satisfy the above restrictions and @xmath23 if and only if @xmath24 intersects @xmath22 .",
    "we refer to @xmath22 as the _ frame of @xmath25 _ and @xmath25 as the _ vertex of @xmath22_.      as a consequence of restriction ( 1 ) , when needed , we may assume all vertical sides ( of all frames ) occupy different @xmath26-coordinates and all horizontal sides ( of all frames ) occupy different @xmath27-coordinates .",
    "a consequence of restriction ( 3 ) is that any frame which intersects the top edge of another frame also intersects the bottom edge of that frame .",
    "figure  [ fig : inter ] illustrates the only way two frames are allowed to intersect in a representation of a restricted frame graph . note that by ( 4 ) , no other frame is allowed to be contained in the intersection of their interior .",
    "two non - adjacent vertices @xmath28 and @xmath25 of a graph @xmath3 are said to be _ twins _ if @xmath29 .",
    "[ rem : twin ] if a graph @xmath3 has a restricted frame representation and if @xmath25 is a vertex of @xmath3 , the graph obtained by adding a twin of @xmath25 to @xmath3 also has a restricted frame representation ( where the twin is represented by a frame just inside the frame of @xmath25 ) .",
    "in this section , we characterize connected triangle - free restricted frame graphs that can not be disconnected by the removal of the closed neighborhood of a vertex . we first describe a simple subclass of restricted frame graphs .    a graph obtained from a tree @xmath0 by adding a vertex @xmath25 adjacent to every leaf of @xmath0",
    "is called a _ chandelier_. the vertex @xmath25 is called the _ pivot _ of the chandelier .",
    "if the tree @xmath0 has the property that the neighbor of each leaf has degree two , then the chandelier is a _ luxury _ chandelier .",
    "note that any subdivision of a ( luxury ) chandelier is a ( luxury ) chandelier .",
    "[ lem : trees ] any chandelier is a restricted frame graph .    any rooted tree can be represented in such a way that the frame for the root has the leftmost left side , and the frame for leaves have the rightmost right side ( see figure  [ fig : btree ] ) .",
    "now we simply add the pivot @xmath25 as a large box intersecting exactly these leaves frames .",
    "rooted in @xmath28 together with a vertex @xmath25 adjacent to each of the leaves of @xmath0 . ]",
    "the remainder of this section is devoted to proving the converse of this theorem for triangle - free graphs without full star - cutsets , which we now define .",
    "a _ full star - cutset _ in a connected graph @xmath3 is a set of vertices @xmath30 whose removal disconnects @xmath3 .",
    "the vertex @xmath28 is called the _ center _ of the full star - cutset and the set @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath31 $ ] , is called the _ closed neighborhood _ of @xmath28 .",
    "[ obs - lux - path ] a tree @xmath0 has no full star - cutset if and only if @xmath0 is a path on at most @xmath32 vertices .    a chandelier has no full star - cutset if and only if it is a luxury chandelier .    for any tree @xmath0 ,",
    "if @xmath0 contains a vertex @xmath25 of degree at least @xmath33 , any neighbor of @xmath25 is the center of a full star - cutset . since any path with length",
    "at least @xmath32 has a full star - cutset , @xmath0 is a path on at most @xmath32 vertices .",
    "it is easily checked that a luxury chandelier has no full star - cutset , by considering successively the cases where the deleted vertex is the vertex @xmath25 , a leaf of the tree ( this is where the assumption that the chandelier is luxury is used ) , or any other vertex of the tree .    in a chandelier that is not a luxury chandelier ,",
    "some leaf @xmath25 of the tree has a parent of degree at least 3 and is therefore the center of a full star - cutset in the chandelier .",
    "we now state the main result of this section , whose proof will be given in section  [ sec : pf ] , after all needed lemmas .",
    "[ th : noscs ] suppose @xmath1 is a connected triangle - free graph with no full star - cutset and @xmath34 is a subdivision of @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath34 is a restricted frame graph  if and only if @xmath1 is either a path on at most 4 vertices or a luxury chandelier .",
    "this result has the following direct consequence .",
    "[ cor : noscs ] every connected triangle - free graph @xmath1 with no full star - cutset which is neither a path on at most 4 vertices , nor a luxury chandelier is a counterexample to scott s conjecture .",
    "while the condition in theorem  [ th : noscs ] ( and corollary  [ cor : noscs ] ) may seem technical , they still apply to a wide range of graphs , including small ones . for example , all the graphs of figure  [ fig : ex33 ] ( as well as their subdivisions ) are counterexamples to scott s conjecture .",
    "the leftmost graph ( the 1-subdivision of @xmath2 ) , call it @xmath1 , is particularly interesting : any triangle - free subdivision of @xmath2 which is not a subdivision of @xmath1 can be represented as a restricted frame graph  ( see appendix  [ sec : k4 ] for details ) . on the other hand ,",
    "such subdivisions have full star - cutsets , so this shows that the technical condition is needed in theorem  [ th : noscs ] .",
    "extensions of corollary  [ cor : noscs ] remain open .",

    "we say that a frame @xmath35 _ contains _ a frame @xmath36 if @xmath35 and @xmath36 do not intersect and @xmath36 is completely contained in the region bounded by @xmath35 . if @xmath35 contains @xmath36 , we also say that @xmath36 is _ inside _ @xmath35 .",
