    "cavity optomechanical systems , consisting of high - quality optical cavities coupled to mechanical resonators , offer a promising route to making precision measurements in both the applied and fundamental science domains @xcite . in dispersively - coupled systems , the motion of the mechanical resonator shifts the resonance frequency of the optical cavity , which can in turn be observed as periodic changes in the amplitude or phase of light traversing the cavity .",
    "optomechanics thus provides an extremely sensitive readout for micro- and nano - mechanical resonators , enabling their use as exquisite sensors of a variety of phenomena on small scales , including displacement @xcite , force @xcite , torque @xcite and acceleration @xcite .",
    "this readout sensitivity has also motivated fundamental searches for quantum properties of nanomechanical resonators @xcite at , or near , their vibrational ground state where mechanical motion originates from quantum zero - point fluctuations .",
    "the hybrid nature of optomechanical systems additionally makes them desirable for applications in quantum information processing architectures @xcite , and as a resource for entangled @xcite , squeezed @xcite or other non - classical states @xcite .",
    "noise from thermally - driven oscillations of mechanical resonators poses a significant obstacle to performing many of these proposed experiments .",
    "mechanical resonators with frequencies in the khz to ghz range have thermal occupancies of billions to thousands of phonons at room temperature , which can easily drown out any quantum signature .",
    "reducing this thermal occupation is thus of great importance .",
    "the optomechanical interaction can be exploited to actively cool the mechanical mode into or near its ground state @xcite but a fundamental limit to this process is imposed by the temperature of the mechanical resonator s bath , necessitating cryogenic pre - cooling @xcite .",
    "active optomechanical cooling furthermore reduces the quality factor ( @xmath1 ) of the mechanical resonator , decreasing the signal - to - noise ratio at low temperatures @xcite . for these reasons , we focus on passively cooling our resonators , which additionally facilitates the use of sensitive optomechanical systems for probing low temperature phenomena such as superfluidity @xcite and superconductivity @xcite .    m. ( b ) simulation of a whispering gallery mode optical resonance , showing a cross - section of the bottle with the optical field localized along the equator .",
    "( c ) representative mechanical spectrum , measured at room temperature .",
    "the three most prominent resonances are indicated by the corresponding mechanical mode simulation.,width=3 ]    in previous experiments , optomechanical systems have been passively cooled using both helium flow cryostats @xcite and dilution refrigerators @xcite .",
    "our system uses a dilution refrigerator for its lower achievable base temperature and , in contrast to the system presented in ref .",
    ", uses the highly - efficient tapered - fiber coupling method @xcite , which is compatible with both bulk and on - chip optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "here , we present measurements of so - called silica bottle resonators @xcite , shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , which have ellipsoidal shapes and exhibit optical whispering gallery modes ( wgm ) in the infrared and visible range , a simulation of which is shown in figure [ fig : fig1](b ) .",
    "they are interesting structures for their high optical quality factors ( @xmath2 up to @xmath3 ) and the tunability of their mode structure @xcite . additionally , these bottle resonators have mechanical breathing modes with frequencies in the 50 to 250 mhz range , figure [ fig : fig1](c ) , corresponding to average phonon occupancies of just 3.3 and 0.4 , respectively , at a temperature of 9 mk ( the base temperature of our dilution refrigerator )",
    ". the significant modal overlap of the optical and mechanical modes , which are both localized at the equator , leads to a large optomechanical coupling , on the order of @xmath4 ghz / nm .",
    "furthermore , the combination of high optical quality factor and high mechanical frequency places these devices in the sideband - resolved regime , enabling many of the important tools of optomechanics @xcite .",
    "we fabricate our bottle resonators by applying tension to each end of a single mode optical fiber while melting it with a co@xmath5 laser .",
    "this process results in a string of resonators , as shown in figure [ fig : fig1](a ) , separated from each other by thin stems . by controlling the intensity of the co@xmath5 laser and the length of the pull time ,",
    "we create resonators with symmetric shapes and extremely thin supporting stems .",
    "this reduces phonon tunnelling through the stems and increases the mechanical quality factor @xcite",
    ".    tapered fibers @xcite are used to couple light into the wgms of the bottles .",
    "these fibers have a small core ( on the order of the wavelength of the light ) and no cladding , save the medium surrounding the fiber .",
    "our tapers are created by heating an optical fiber with a hydrogen torch and pulling it until a minimum diameter of @xmath01 @xmath6 m is reached @xcite , resulting in a large evanescent field .",
    "this allows efficient coupling of light to wgm resonators through frustrated total internal reflection .",
    "we passively cool the taper and bottle resonators using a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 9 mk @xcite . to facilitate taper - resonator coupling at cryogenic temperatures",
    ", we have built an optomechanical coupling system within the inner vacuum can ( ivc ) , on the mixing chamber plate , as pictured in figure [ fig : bottles](a ) .",
    "the bottles are mounted on top of a stack of nanopositioning stages , which allow full three - dimensional control over the position of the resonators .",
    "they are thermally anchored to the mixing chamber through a series of oxygen - free high - conductivity copper plates and braids .",
    "the taper is epoxied and mounted to a large invar block , which minimizes the effects of thermal contractions . a homebuilt low - temperature microscope @xcite enables real - time _ in situ _ imaging of the taper - resonator system with a resolution of @xmath01 @xmath6 m ( figure [ fig : bottles](b ) ) .",
    "we inject light from a tunable diode laser housed at room temperature into the tapered fiber and detect the transmitted light with a fast photodetector .",
    "the optical and mechanical properties of the bottles can thus be measured from the low- and high - frequency parts of the photodetector voltage , respectively .",
    "characterization of the near - infrared optical modes is performed by scanning a tunable diode laser ( 1500 - 1630 nm ) with angular frequency @xmath7 across a resonance , resulting in the following expression for the low - frequency part of the transmission @xmath8 ( in units of photons per second ) through the tapered fiber    @xmath9    here @xmath10 is the rate of photons passing through the tapered fiber , for injected laser power @xmath11 and reduced planck constant @xmath12 .",
    "the linewidth of the resonance is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the intrinsic decay rate and @xmath15 is the rate at which photons are exchanged between the bottle and tapered fiber .",
    "our setup allows us to sensitively control the relative strengths of these intrinsic and extrinsic decay rates @xcite . for the measurements that follow ,",
    "the resonator is operated in the slightly - undercoupled regime ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the number of photons inside the cavity ,    @xmath17    is a function of the laser detuning @xmath18 from the cavity resonance , @xmath19 . for the whispering gallery modes in a bottle of radius @xmath20 , the angular optical resonance frequencies @xmath21",
    "are given by    @xmath22    the integer @xmath23 is a mode label for a particular resonance , @xmath24 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath25 is the refractive index of the bottle and @xmath26 is a geometric factor which accounts for the fact that the optical mode is not perfectly confined to the surface of the resonator @xcite .    for relatively low injected optical powers ( @xmath27 nw )",
    ", the optical resonances can be measured without heating the mixing chamber thermometer and have @xmath2 of 10@xmath28 - 10@xmath29 , which are consistent with their room - temperature quality factors . at larger injected powers ,",
    "light lost from the taper ( @xmath030% ) heats the cryogenic environment @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the high @xmath2 , and correspondingly long photon lifetime , in the cavity leads to an increased absorption of laser photons in the silica .",

    "( b ) simulation of a nonlinear resonance , with the same parameters as above and @xmath32 hz .",
    "all real solutions to equation are plotted in black , while the transmission for a forward ( reverse ) scan of the laser is plotted in green ( red ) . ]",
    "this absorption generates a local heating of the silica within the optical mode volume , which in turn causes both a change in the bottle dimensions through thermal expansion and a change in the refractive index through the thermo - refractive effect .",
    "we can then rewrite equation with taylor - expanded expressions for the radius and the refractive index @xcite ,    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the equilibrium temperature of the glass in the absence of laser heating , @xmath35 is the temperature increase caused by optical absorption , and @xmath36 is the linear thermal expansion coefficient . although higher - order terms become important under some conditions @xcite , here we keep only terms to first order in @xmath35 and for simplicity write @xmath37 .    incorporating the modified @xmath21 into equation",
    ", we have    @xmath38    where the thermo - optical effects have been written into a nonlinear detuning parameter @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this parameter can be thought of as the shift in the optical resonance frequency per intracavity photon , and is related to the parameters in equation by @xmath40 , under the assumption that the temperature gradient @xmath35 is proportional to the number of intracavity photons .",
    "as we will see , the exact constant of proportionality will depend on the resonator s heat dissipation .",
    "equation is now a nonlinear function of @xmath41 , giving rise to up to three distinct real solutions for appropriate values of @xmath42 .",
    "experimentally , this is manifest as a bistability and hysteresis in the resonance shape , which is dependent on the scanning direction of the laser @xcite , as illustrated in figure [ fig : nonlin_theory ] . as the laser is tuned closer to the optical resonance , more photons",
    "are coupled into the cavity , causing a greater shift in the resonance frequency , such that it becomes distorted from the linear shape shown in figure [ fig : nonlin_theory](a ) .     of approximately ( a ) @xmath43 hz and ( b ) @xmath44 hz . ]",
    "this nonlinear optical behaviour is observed in our experiments , as shown in figure [ fig : nonlin_exp ] for a @xmath45 @xmath6 m bottle . using the cubic equation to exactly solve equation",
    ", we fit our experimental data to extract @xmath42 under various experimental conditions .",
    "in particular , we find that injecting a large quantity of helium exchange gas into the ivc at 4.2 k reduces @xmath42 by an order of magnitude ( @xmath46 hz compared to @xmath44 hz in vacuum ) .",
    "we furthermore find that @xmath42 at the fridge base temperature ( @xmath47 hz ) is comparable to that at 4.2 k in vacuum .",
    "although it will not be discussed here , it is worth noting that at intermediate pressures of helium exchange gas , we observe a higher - order thermo - optical nonlinearity .",
    "this results in up to five real solutions to a modified form of equation , and presents itself in the experiment as a multistability in the resonance profile .",
    "this effect is thought to originate from a reversal of the thermo - refractive effect at low temperatures @xcite , although the nonlinear temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient @xcite may also contribute .",
    "the high - frequency part of the taper transmission encodes the mechanical motion of the bottle resonator .",
    "we collect this signal by recording a time trace of the high - pass filtered photodetector voltage with a fast analog - to - digital converter .",
    "the @xmath45 @xmath6 m bottle studied has several mechanical resonances , with the most prominent being at 55 , 85 and 109 mhz , with room temperature quality factors of @xmath0 @xmath48 . at low temperatures , we focus on the lowest - frequency ( 55 mhz ) mode , which has an effective mass @xmath49 ng and optomechanical coupling strength @xmath50 ghz / nm .",
    "it is important to note that , despite significant efforts to thermally anchor the bottle resonators to the base plate of the fridge , the thermometers used to measure the temperature of the mixing chamber will not provide an accurate measure of the mechanical mode temperature .",
    "the thermally - insulating nature of silica along with the very thin connections between the bottles prevent efficient conduction of heat , while incident laser light used to measure the mechanics leads to local heating of the resonator . dynamical back - action effects in the optomechanical interaction",
    "can also lead to mode - specific heating or cooling @xcite which is not reflected in the temperature of the bulk silica .    to independently determine the temperature",
    ", we exploit the thermally - driven motion of the resonator . in this case , the resonator s spectral response is quantified by its one - sided power spectral density ( psd ) . for a resonator with effective mass , @xmath51 , at temperature @xmath34 , the displacement psd is given by @xcite    @xmath52 } , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    for a sufficiently long measurement time @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) . here",
    ", @xmath55 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath56 is the angular frequency of the mechanical resonance and @xmath57 is the fourier transform of the resonator s position @xmath58 .",
    "it is evident that the amplitude of the displacement psd ( @xmath59 ) scales linearly with @xmath34 and thus gives a direct measurement of the mode temperature .    in our experiments",
    ", we measure this displacement response by fourier transforming the photodetector voltage , squaring and dividing the result by the measurement bandwidth .",
    "the voltage psd is given by the sum of a detection system - dependent noise floor @xmath60 and the transduction of @xmath61 through the optical cavity and photodetector ,    @xmath62    the transduction of @xmath61 scales with the square of the rate of injected photons , as well as the square of the ratio of the optomechanical coupling strength to the mechanical resonance frequency .",
    "all of the detuning dependence of @xmath63 is contained in @xmath64 ( see appendix ) , a function which describes the transduction of the resonator s fluctuations in position into fluctuations in first taper transmission and then voltage .    .",
    "the motion of the optomechanical resonator ( omr ) imposes additional sidebands , at @xmath56 .",
    "both sets of sidebands are detected by the photodiode ( pd ) , resulting in a high - pass filtered ( hpf ) spectrum that has two distinct peaks corresponding to the phase modulation ( 54.5 mhz ) and the mechanical motion ( 55 mhz ) . ]",
    "precise knowledge of the laser detuning , along with the optomechanical coupling strength @xmath65 , injected optical power and the gains of the detection electronics , would allow the extraction of @xmath61 , and hence the temperature , from equation .",
    "this is not always experimentally feasible , so we instead indirectly calibrate @xmath63 by injecting an all - optical signal of known energy into the system @xcite .",
    "the general procedure for doing so is outlined in figure [ fig : phasecalibration ] .",
    "an electro - optic modulator ( eom ) driven at angular frequency @xmath66 phase modulates the input laser light , generating optical sidebands on the laser at frequencies @xmath67 for integer @xmath68 .",
    "if the phase modulation depth , @xmath69 , is small ( @xmath70 for applied voltage @xmath71 and eom half - wave voltage @xmath72 ) , only the first order sidebands ( @xmath73 ) need be considered .",
    "if @xmath66 is chosen such that @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the resonance linewidth , the psd of the photodetector signal becomes ( see appendix )    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the spectrum of the applied phase modulation .",
    "this spectrum features two distinct peaks , as shown in figure [ fig : phasecalibration ] at @xmath66 and @xmath56 .",
    "if we additionally assume that @xmath78 , such that the response of the detection electronics is flat , then @xmath79 and the phase modulation signal and mechanical motion are transduced similarly through the optical cavity .",
    "although the strength of each peak in @xmath63 depends sensitively on the injected optical power and the laser detuning , this dependence is identical between the two peaks , such that it simply provides an overall scale for the spectrum .",
    "in contrast , any change in @xmath34 will affect only the mechanical resonance at @xmath56 through @xmath61 .",
    "if the phase modulation conditions are held constant , we can then find the temperature of the mode through the ratio    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the integrated area under the phase modulation peak and @xmath82 is the area under the mechanical resonance .",
    "for the purpose of these calculations we subtract the detection noise floor , @xmath60 .",
    "we drive our eom at @xmath83 mhz and measure @xmath84 at liquid helium temperature ( 4.2 k ) , where a copious quantity of exchange gas in the ivc ensures good thermalization of the bottle resonator with the outer helium bath .",
    "the result , @xmath85 , fixes the temperature measurement scale .",
    "the mechanical mode temperature is thus given by    @xmath86    measurements of the bottle resonator made under various experimental conditions at low temperatures are shown in figure [ fig : allparams ] .",
    "the laser was scanned across the optical resonance and the low- and high - frequency parts of the taper transmission were recorded simultaneously . from left to right , measurements were made at 4.2 k in exchange gas and in vacuum , as well as in vacuum with the fridge operating at its base temperature of 9 mk . in all cases , an injected power of @xmath87 @xmath6w was used .",
    "as the laser is tuned to the center of the optical resonance , the low - frequency transmission decreases and more photons are coupled into the bottle .",
    "there is a corresponding decrease in the mechanical resonance frequency , which is accompanied by an increase in the mode temperature . in exchange gas , the temperature increase is small , on the order of a few kelvin , and the maximum relative frequency shift amounts to approximately @xmath88 .",
    "in contrast , when the ivc is evacuated , we see strikingly similar behavior regardless of whether the fridge is operated at 4.2 k or base temperature . in both cases ,",
    "the temperature increases to approximately 40 k , while the mechanical frequency decreases by @xmath89 .",
    "we also observe a significant decrease in @xmath1 , from 1100 to 600 , as the laser is tuned to the center of the optical resonance .     versus calibrated mode temperature .",
    "lines are guides to the eye and black triangles are data points at 77 k ( liquid nitrogen ) and 295 k ( room temperature ) in nitrogen exchange gas . ]    for a more direct comparison , the mechanical resonance frequency and inverse @xmath1 are plotted versus measured mechanical mode temperature in figure [ fig : alldata ] for a number of injected optical powers .",
    "black triangles indicate measurements taken at 77 k ( liquid nitrogen ) and 295 k ( room temperature ) , where the bottles were thermalized using nitrogen exchange gas .",
    "our measurements reveal key information about heat dissipation in the bottle resonators . despite efforts to thermally anchor the bottles to the base temperature of the fridge , the lowest achieved mode temperature was approximately 4 k , corresponding to an average occupation of just @xmath01500 phonons .",
    "this temperature was reached when helium exchange gas was added to the ivc , indicating that the gaseous helium facilitated convection between the resonator and the bath of liquid helium . in vacuum , regardless of whether the fridge was operated at base temperature or liquid helium temperature , the temperature of the bottle was raised upon optomechanical measurements , as shown in figures [ fig : allparams ] and [ fig : alldata ] .",
    "this is evidence of the intrinsically weak thermal connection between the mixing chamber and the silica bottle resonator .",
    "this heating arises as a result of the absorption of laser light into the bulk silica .",
    "the degree of nonlinearity in the optical resonances , quantified through the parameter @xmath39 , serves as a measurement of the temperature change generated by the absorbed light .",
    "we find that @xmath39 is nearly an order of magnitude larger in vacuum than in exchange gas , since the lack of convection greatly reduces the efficiency with which the bottle can dissipate heat .",
    "these results are entirely consistent with measurements of the mechanical frequency shift with temperature .",
    "as the laser is scanned across an optical resonance , we find that the mechanical resonance frequency exhibits the same dependence on laser detuning as the taper transmission .",
    "we furthermore observe a relative frequency shift in vacuum that is nearly ten times larger than that in exchange gas .",
    "since the optical and mechanical modes occupy nearly the same volume within the bottle structure , heating of the optical modes by laser absorption is reflected equally in the mechanical mode .",
    "finally , we observe a significant dependence of the mechanical quality factor on temperature , with a shape that is characteristic of phonon - coupling to configurational two - level systems in glass @xcite . at high temperatures , thermal activation over a potential barrier",
    "allows transitions between the two configurations ; as the temperature is lowered , thermal activation ceases and quantum tunneling can occur . at still lower temperatures ,",
    "quantum tunneling is also forbidden and the mechanical quality factor increases dramatically . from the shape of figure [ fig : alldata](b ) , we deduce that our system resides in the region of thermal activation .",
    "lower temperatures would thus allow us to increase the mechanical quality factor far beyond its room temperature value .",
    "there is also an increase in the mechanical damping rate when the ivc is filled with exchange gas ; we attribute this to interactions with a thin film of liquid helium on the surface of the bottle .",
    "this may be in fact be a promising tool to study ultra - thin superfluid films @xcite via interactions with the optical and mechanical modes of resonator .",
    "we note that the general shapes of both figure [ fig : alldata](a ) and ( b ) are in agreement with the observations of silica toroid resonators reported in ref . .",
    "we have demonstrated passive cooling of a 64 ng optomechanical resonator down to just @xmath01500 phonons .",
    "further cooling is prevented by the inability to dissipate the heat caused by optical absorption , exacerbated by the high @xmath2 of the silica resonator .",
    "the scale of this optical absorption was found to be in excellent agreement with the degree of heating in the mechanical mode .",
    "this comparison was enabled by optomechanical mode thermometry , detailed in the appendix , which is now an important tool for quantum optomechanics .",
    "future experiments will focus on improving the coupling of these sideband - resolved optomechanical resonators to the thermal bath .",
    "one possibility to achieve this is to use a local reservoir of helium as a heat link to the 9 mk dilution refrigerator environment , which would reduce optically - induced heating of the resonator @xcite .",
    "in particular , it would be intriguing to use liquid helium , which has been shown to provide an excellent thermalization medium for micro - electromechanical systems ( mems ) down to @xmath060 mk @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mems in ref .   regain their vacuum mechanical dissipation levels at @xmath90100 mk , due to the temperature - dependent phonon occupation in the superfluid state .",
    "successful thermalization of the presented nanogram - scale microresonators to 9 mk would result in average phonon occupancies of @xmath91 , while maintaining the high mechanical @xmath92 and sideband - resolved nature of these optomechanical devices , opening up the door for ground state cooling @xcite and further quantum optomechanical protocols @xcite",
    ". finally , extension of these cryogenic silica microresonators to doped optical glasses would also enable new quantum technologies , such as photonic memories for quantum cryptographic networks @xcite .",
