    "the goal of a classification scheme is to rationally organize a large collection of objects ( animals , plants , books , galaxies ) into a fixed number of smaller classes _ without leaving any object aside _ , in order to help dealing with this large collection .",
    "there are obviously many ways to classify objects , depending on what properties one is mostly interested in . for galaxies , one could , for example , be mainly interested in the morphology @xcite , colours @xcite , spectral features @xcite etc .",
    "it is not only the considered object properties that change from one classification system to another , but also the philosophies underlying the classification process ( hierarchical or non hierarchical , supervised or not supervised ,  ) all of which have their advantages and drawbacks .",
    "ideally , a classification scheme should be objective and allow easy incorporation of new objects into predefined categories .",
    "the last criterion , for instance , is not fulfilled by the classifications using principal component analysis @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the classification scheme must be useful , hubble s famous tuning fork being a classical example .",
    "another one is the emission - line classification scheme pioneered by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which has been widely used over the last three decades .",
    "the advent of large surveys of galaxies providing extensive collections of homogeneous data sets not easily tractable with conventional methods fostered new classification schemes based on automatic procedures such as neural networks @xcite , k - means cluster analysis of entire galaxy spectra @xcite , or on human - eye analysis of galaxy morphology by hundreds of thousands of volunteers , as in the beautiful galaxy zoo project @xcite .",
    "emission - line classifications of galaxies are among the easiest to carry out ( once the emission line intensities are measured ) and allow one to deal with such issues as star formation , chemical composition or nuclear activity .",
    "they have , for example , helped to gain insight into the nature of warm infrared galaxies @xcite , of luminous infrared galaxies @xcite , of galaxies in compact groups @xcite or into the connection between active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the most famous emission - line diagnostic diagram is that based on the [ oiii]@xmath125007/h@xmath13  vs [ nii]@xmath126584/h@xmath1  line ratios@xmath125007  and [ nii]@xmath126584  will be denoted  and , respectively . ]",
    "( dubbed the bpt diagram after @xcite ) .",
    "this diagram was built to pin down the main source of ionization in the spectra of extragalactic objects , and became one of the major tools for the classification and analysis of emission line galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) .    as emphasized by (",
    "* cf10 ) , the bpt diagram leaves unclassified a large proportion of emission line galaxies in the sdss , due to quality requirements on 4 emission lines .",
    "the @xcite classification is even more demanding , as it requires the intensities of as many as 7 lines .",
    "to remedy this situation , have proposed a much more economic diagram that allows one to attain the same objectives using only two lines , h@xmath1  and , which are generally the most prominent in the spectra of galaxies .",
    "this is a diagram plotting the h@xmath1  equivalent width versus /h@xmath1 , which was dubbed the ewh@xmath1n2 diagram in that paper and which we will from now on refer to as the whan diagram , for simplicity . \\else",
    "[ n\\,{\\sc ii}]\\fi\\xspace}}$ ] vs /h@xmath1   diagram of @xcite .",
    "however , the whan diagram is easier to interpret , since it concerns two physically independent quantities , @xmath0 measuring the amount of ionizing photons absorbed by the gas relative to the stellar mass , while /h@xmath1is a function of the nitrogen abundance , of the ionization state and temperature of the gas . ] the border lines between different classes of galaxies in the whan diagram were defined by optimal transpositions of the @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* s06 ) and @xcite border lines onto the @xmath0 vs /h@xmath1  plane .",
    "the categories of emission line galaxies considered by @xcite and @xcite comprised star forming galaxies ( sf ) , seyferts , and liners this latter category is supposed to comprise objects hosting low - level nuclear activity .",
    "however , as demonstrated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* s08 ) , the liner region in the bpt diagram also contains galaxies that have stopped forming stars and are actually ionized by the hot evolved low - mass stars ( holmes ) contained in them .",
    "this idea is not new .",
    "it was already put forward to explain the emission line spectrum of elliptical galaxies @xcite and even earlier in different contexts @xcite .",
    "this idea is recently gaining support @xcite , especially with the detailed study of nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "as shown by , when taking into account the `` forgotten population '' of weak line galaxies , the proportion of such `` retired galaxies '' ( rgs ) increases dramatically .",
    "it is therefore essential to find ways to distinguish these rgs from truly `` active '' galaxies , i.e. galaxies which contain a ( weak ) agn .",
    "this is one of the goals of the present paper .",
    "our second goal is to link the universe of emission line galaxies ( elgs ) with the universe of galaxies without emission lines ( often dubbed `` passive galaxies '' , pg ) .",
    "we will see that rgs and passive galaxies are in fact very similar objects .    with our whan diagram",
    ", we will thus be able to provide a comprehensive classification of all sdss galaxies , including pgs .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section [ sec : data ] presents the samples of galaxies used to work out our classification and our starlight data base from which the properties of galaxies that we use are extracted .",
    "section [ sec : preliminary ] lists the initial definition of galaxy classes : sf , seyferts , liners and pgs .",
    "section [ sec : rgs ] , the core of this paper , sorts out rgs from agn among liner - like galaxies and proposes a practical criterion to identify them . section [ sec : revised_ewhan2 ] describes our comprehensive classification of galaxies based on the whan diagram and leading to five classes : sf , strong agn , weak agn , rg and pg .",
    "section [ sec : sfhs ] examines the star formation histories of galaxies within our new classification scheme , placing rgs in the context of the galaxy population in general .",
    "section [ sec : distributions ] discusses the distributions of a series of physical and observed properties in the different galaxy classes , to test the pertinence of our new classification .",
    "finally , section [ sec : summary ] summarizes our main results .",
    "we draw from the nearly 700 thousand galaxies from the main galaxy sample @xcite in the 7@xmath14 data release of the sdss @xcite . besides the sdss data , we make use of a suite of starlight - derived products available at www.starlight.ufsc.br , like stellar masses , stellar extinctions and the full star formation histories @xcite .",
    "emission line properties are measured after subtraction of the underlying stellar component determined with the starlight fit , as described in @xcite .",
    "two samples are used throughout this work .",
    "the `` full sample '' ( hereafter `` sample f '' ) is selected by requiring _",
    "( i ) _ a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath15 in the continuum around 4750  , _ ( ii ) _ no faulty pixels within @xmath16   of h@xmath1and , _ ( iii ) _",
    "@xmath17 to eliminate the few objects at higher redshift which survive the previous criterion , and ( iv ) @xmath18 to minimize apertures effects . in total ,",
    "sample f contains 379330 galaxies .",
    "sample v is built from a volume limited sample satisfying @xmath19 and absolute r - band magnitude @xmath20 , to which we further apply criteria _ ( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ above .",
    "these latter cuts imply only a 6 percent reduction , with little loss of completeness at the faint end , so this sample is effectively limited in volume .",
    "sample v comprises 152749 objects . by choosing @xmath21",
    "we eliminate cases where h@xmath1and fall in a region of strong sky lines , so that criterion _",
    "( ii ) _ is fulfilled .",
    "these samples fulfill the basic requirements for this work . condition _ ( i ) _ ensures meaningful spectral fits , necessary for stellar population analysis and the production of templates to aid emission line measurements , while _ ( ii ) _ ensures that the detection of h@xmath1and ( the most important lines in this study ) is not hampered by artifacts like bad pixels or sky residuals . at the same time , neither of these samples is biased for or against the presence of emission lines , which allows us to treat systems with strong , weak or no emission lines on an equal footing .",
    "sample f has the advantage of being more numerous and of extending to lower luminosities , while sample v is more adequate for demographic studies and unbiased comparisons among sub - samples . the novelties in this work , namely the criterion to separate true from fake agn and the resulting revision of conventional spectral taxonomy",
    ", are mainly related to the most luminous galaxies , so that , in practise , we could use either sample v or f. in what follows , unless stated otherwise , we use sample v.",
    "we sub - divide galaxies into different classes according to their emission line properties .",
    "the first division is among galaxies with and `` without '' emission lines , denoted elgs and pgs , respectively .",
    "pgs are defined as those with very weak or undetected emission lines .",
    "galaxies are deemed passive if the equivalent widths ( @xmath22 ) of _ both _ h@xmath1and fall below 0.5  , a criterion which applies to 19 ( 20)% of sample v ( f ) .",
    "since these are the two strongest optical lines , this criterion automatically implies that other lines will be even weaker in general ( e.g. @xcite ; ) .",
    "in the literature one often finds pgs and elgs defined in terms of limits on the signal to noise ratio ( @xmath23 ) of emission lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we consider a @xmath22-based criterion more appropriate , as it is based on a more direct measurement of the line strength and less explicitly dependent on the quality of the data .",
    "in addition @xmath22 s have an astrophysical meaning .",
    "we emphasize that the adopted limiting value of 0.5   is not really meaningful .",
    "as will be seen later , none of the discussion presented in this paper would have changed if had we adopted a slightly different limit .",
    "we also note in passing that the denomination `` passive '' for `` line - less '' systems is adopted just for compatibility with current nomenclature , with no evolutionary connotation as the word would suggest .",
    "elgs are defined as everything else , i.e. , any source where either @xmath0 or @xmath11 \\else [ n\\,{\\sc ii}]\\fi\\xspace}}$ ] is @xmath24  .",
    "notice that this stretches the definition of an elg to its limit , since , in extreme cases , only one of h@xmath1or is detected !",
    "sample v ( f ) has 124410 ( 303194 ) elgs , 94 ( 92)% of which have both lines stronger than 0.5  .",
    "elgs are normally subdivided into sf and agn - like classes on the basis of diagnostic diagrams involving at least 4 lines , like the bpt diagram ( /h@xmath13versus /h@xmath1 ) .",
    "as shown in , the weakness of either or both of h@xmath13and implies that such traditional classification schemes leave large numbers of elgs unclassified .",
    "this problem is particularly severe in the right wing of the bpt diagram , where agn - like systems reside , but well over half of the galaxies have unusable h@xmath13and / or fluxes . in that same paper",
    "we introduced alternative diagnostic diagrams able to cope with galaxies with weak or undetected h@xmath13and / or , the most economic of which is @xmath0 versus /h@xmath1 , hereafter the whan diagram .",
    "we base all our classifications on this diagram , which , unlike any other , allows us to classify _ all _ galaxies .",
    "the whan diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ewhan2 ] . the vertical line at @xmath7 \\else [ n\\,{\\sc",
    "ii}]\\fi\\xspace}/{\\ifmmode { \\rm h}\\alpha \\else h$\\alpha$\\fi\\xspace}= -0.40 $ ] corresponds to the optimal transposition of the bpt - based sf / agn division , designed to differentiate sources where star formation provides all ionizing photons from those where a harder ionizing spectrum is required .",
    "similarly , the division at @xmath25   represents an optimal transposition of the @xcite division between seyferts and liners on the basis of 7 emission lines . unlike @xcite and other studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ", we do not define a `` sf+agn composite '' category , and so our seyfert / liner border line goes all the way to the sf / agn frontier .",
    "( the reader is referred to for a discussion of the pros and cons of this diagram , as well as for a discussion of why we prefer not to define a composite category . )",
    "sample v splits into percentage fractions of 23 , 21 and 37 sf , seyferts and liners , respectively .",
    "pgs account for the remaining 19% .",
    "the corresponding fractions for sample f are very similar : 25 , 19 , 36 and 20% .    the dotted lines in fig .",

    "points below these lines ( painted in orange or red ) are thus very uncertain  , which produces the empty triangle in the bottom left part of the plot . ] , but are nevertheless plotted to remind the reader of the existence of such objects .",
    "there is indeed some advantage in including line - less galaxies in an emission line classification scheme since the absence of emission lines is also an information !",
    "the region below the dotted lines includes both elgs with only one line @xmath24  , as well as pgs ( below the dashed lines , in red ) for which we have h@xmath1and fluxes in our database .",
    "ideally , splitting elgs into sf and agn would separate systems whose emission lines are powered exclusively by young stars from those where accretion onto a central super - massive black hole dominates ( or at least contributes to ) the ionizing radiation field . however , as reviewed in the introduction , this binary scheme does not account for a third phenomenon : photoionization by holmes . these retired galaxies ( rgs )",
    "are numerous in large - scale surveys , where they occupy liner - like locations in the commonly used diagnostic diagrams , and are thus erroneously associated to non - stellar activity .",
    "this section investigates ways of identifying rgs .",
    "we start with a theoretically motivated definition , but end up with a very simple empirical criterion to diagnose rgs among elgs .      by definition , rgs are systems whose old stellar populations suffice to explain the observed emission line properties . since we already know that nebulae photoionized by holmes cover most regions in intensity ratios diagrams , we shall adopt an operationally simple energy - budget criterion and define rgs as _ galaxies whose old stellar populations are capable of accounting for all of the observed h@xmath1emission_.    let @xmath27 be the intrinsic ( extinction corrected ) h@xmath1luminosity of a galaxy , and @xmath28 denote the luminosity expected from photoionization by populations older than @xmath29 yr . the ratio    @xmath30    should thus be able to tell if a galaxy is retired ( @xmath31 ) or whether some extra source of ionizing photons is present . given the orders of magnitude difference between the ionizing photon rates of young and old populations ,",
    "even tiny amounts of ongoing star formation suffice to swamp the ionizing field produced by holmes , leading to @xmath4 and to a sf - like emission - line pattern due to the softer ionizing spectrum .",
    "similarly , @xmath2 will also grow above 1 in the presence of an agn .",
    "in fact , as long as a galaxy has enough gas to absorb all @xmath32 ev photons produced within it , @xmath2 should never drop below 1 .",
    "this way of identifying rgs was previously employed by . in what follows we open up the details and discuss the caveats related to the estimation of @xmath2 .      neglecting escape and extinction of lyman continuum radiation , the denominator in eq .",
    "[ eq : xi ] becomes    @xmath33    where @xmath34 for case b hydrogen recombination , and @xmath35 is the expected ionizing photon rate .",
    "the starlight spectral decomposition in terms of a base of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) allows us to estimate @xmath35 for each of our galaxies .",
    "the code returns the mass associated to each of @xmath36 ssps of different ages ( @xmath37 ) and metallicities ( @xmath38 ) , so that the expected flux of ionizing photons from the populations of interest here is simply    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the total stellar mass formed , @xmath41 is the mass - fraction population vector , and @xmath42 is the number of h - ionizing photons emitted per unit time and initial mass for the @xmath43 ssp . since the expected h@xmath1luminosity is to be compared to the one observed within the 3aperture of the sdss spectroscopic fiber , the stellar mass in this equation corresponds to that inside the fiber ( i.e. , we do not extrapolate to account for the whole galaxy ) .",
    "in fact , all our analysis up to section [ sec : sfhs ] uses within - the - fiber data only .",
    "the starlight fits used in this work employ the same base of ssps from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bc03 ) described by @xcite .",
    "naturally , the spectral fits are carried out in the optical range , but the models also provide predictions for the ionizing energies .",
    "this is a key element of our analysis , so it is worth to open a parenthesis to examine these predictions more closely .",
    "[ fig : ssps ] shows the evolution of ssp properties of interest to this work .",
    "panels on the left ( a  d ) correspond to models of 6 different metallicities used in our analysis .",
    "these are discussed first .",
    "[ fig : ssps]a shows the evolution of the hardness of the ionizing spectrum , as measured by the ratio of hei to hi ionizing photons .",
    "the difference between the soft ionization field produced by ob stars ( @xmath44 yr ) and that produced by holmes is clearly visible .",
    "panel b shows the specific ionizing photon rate , @xmath45 , the most relevant quantity for our analysis .",
    "one sees the well known drop by @xmath46 orders of magnitude in @xmath47 from the hii region phase to the time when the holmes regime sets in at @xmath29 yr and @xmath47 approximately stabilizes at a level of the order of @xmath48s@xmath49m@xmath50 . the specific continuum around h@xmath1 , @xmath51 ( equivalent to the inverse of the mass to light ratio , @xmath52 ) , however , keeps decreasing with time ( panel c ) and therefore the predicted @xmath0 ( bottom panel ) goes through a minimum at @xmath29 yr and grows to 1.52.5   at @xmath53 yr .",
    "this is enough to explain a significant proportion of the elgs in the liner zone of fig .",

    "both sets use @xcite and @xcite for the pagb . for reference ,",
    "the predictions for @xmath55 are repeated ( black lines ) .    despite a general qualitative agreement ,",
    "there are significant quantitative differences . for ages above @xmath3yr ,",
    "the hardness ratio varies from 10 to 20% , while @xmath47 differs by up to 1 dex from one model to another .",
    "those differences could be due to differences in stellar tracks , model atmospheres and even interpolation techniques . for @xmath0 ,",
    "the greatest difference is above @xmath56yr for the models , which are @xmath57   larger than the others .",
    "we have also compared different imfs ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "for a given metallicity in a model , different imfs result in variations from 0.2 up to 0.5 dex in @xmath47 and @xmath51 , which is typically of the same order of variations for different models with the same imf .    for the sake of internal consistency with our starlight analysis of sdss galaxies , in what follows",
    "we adopt the predictions from , but this quick compilation illustrates that there are still plenty of uncertainties in model predictions for the lyman continuum of old stellar populations .",
    "naturally , these uncertainties propagate to our estimate of @xmath2 .",
    "fortunately , there is an empirical alternative to circumvent the uncertainties related to this choice ( section [ sec : whadefinitionofrgs ] ) .",
    "let us now turn to the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) .",
    "the caveat in this case is that a nebular extinction is needed to correct @xmath58 to @xmath59 , which in turn requires good measurements of both h@xmath1and h@xmath13 .",
    "while this is not a problem for elgs in the sf and seyfert categories , most of the liner - like systems do not comply with this requirement because of their feeble h@xmath13 .",
    "one way to circumvent this difficulty is to estimate h@xmath1/h@xmath13 in terms of something else . to do this , we first select liners with reliable h@xmath1/h@xmath13 , and then calibrate the relation between nebular ( @xmath60 ) and stellar ( @xmath61 ) extinctions ( as done by @xcite for sf galaxies ) , such that @xmath61 can be used to estimate @xmath60 . in practice , we impose @xmath0 and @xmath62  , and @xmath63 ( such that @xmath64 ) . we adopt an intrinsic balmer decrement of 3 , suitable for liners . ] , which leaves us with only @xmath65 of the full list of liners .",
    "nebular and stellar extinctions are indeed correlated for this sub - sample ( spearman rank correlation coefficient @xmath66 ) , albeit with substantial scatter . a fit through the median relation yields @xmath67 , with typical residuals of @xmath57 mag .",
    "objects used in this calibration have @xmath68 ( median @xmath69 semi inter - quartile range ) , while for liners as a whole the above relation leads to @xmath70 .",
    "this method most likely _ overestimates _",
    "@xmath60 , as there is a trend of increasing @xmath71 with increasing @xmath0 , and h@xmath1is much weaker in the full sample than in the sub - set used to calibrate the @xmath72 relation ( @xmath73 versus 3.7   in the median , respectively ) .",
    "another alternative is to apply the extinction correction when the data allow ( @xmath0 and @xmath62  , and @xmath63 ) , and assume @xmath74 otherwise .",
    "these methods lead to estimates of @xmath2 which should bracket the correct solution .",
    "since @xmath75 implies a 0.32 dex increase in @xmath59 , for the typical inferred @xmath60 values these two methods should differ by @xmath76 0.20.3 dex in @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath2 values derived range from @xmath76 0.1 to 1000 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi_hists]a , which shows the distribution of @xmath2 values for all elgs in sample v. the distribution is strongly _ bimodal _ , with a high @xmath2 peak at @xmath77 and a lower one centred close to @xmath78 .",

    "in fact , for light levels as low as @xmath84 the spectral synthesis analysis is affected both by its own limitations and by side - effects of incompleteness in evolutionary synthesis models , such that the true contribution from young stars can not be reliably estimated ( see section [ sec : sfhs ] ) .",

    "about 1/3 of the full elg sample has @xmath87 .",

    "( bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : ssps ] ) .",
    "this section started with the promise of finding a diagnostic to identify rgs .",
    "the @xmath2 ratio was introduced with this purpose , and we have seen that it is indeed capable of capturing in a single number the essence of rgs",
    ". however , there are caveats related to this index .",
    "firstly , uncertainties related to the extinction correction affect @xmath2 at a level of @xmath122 dex . secondly , and",
    "far more important , @xmath2 is explicitly dependent on evolutionary synthesis models , whose predictions for the ionizing fluxes from old stellar populations are still plagued by systematic uncertainties ( section [ sec : ssps ] , see also ) .",
    "hence , while it is clear that rgs should populate the bottom of the @xmath2-scale , theory alone does not allow us to establish a firm upper limit below which a galaxy can confidently be considered as retired .",
    "a last caveat is that the evaluation of @xmath2 requires a stellar population analysis , which is not always available or possible .",
    "fortunately , there is a simple empirical alternative to circumvent these difficulties .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi_x_wha]a , and in agreement with previous studies ( e.g , @xcite ) , the distribution of @xmath0 is strongly bimodal , with a low peak centred at @xmath123  , an upper one at 16  , and an intermediate minimum in the neighbourhood of 3  .",
    "this happens both for the sample as a whole and for the sub - set of agn - like galaxies , shown by the filled histogram .",
    "this bimodality strongly suggests that different mechanisms are at work : photoionization by holmes on the low @xmath0 side and by massive stars and/or agn for large @xmath0 .",
    "one can therefore use the observed @xmath0 distribution to set an empirical bound for rgs .",
    "of course , the same can be done for the @xmath2 distribution , but it is clearly advantageous to draw this boundary on the basis of an universally available and model - independent quantity : @xmath0 .",
    "we conducted various experiments to define an optimal boundary to separate the two peaks , all giving results between 3 and 4  .",
    "we settled for @xmath124  .",
    "we thus propose to the following practical definition : _ rgs are elgs with @xmath10  . _    for @xmath10 ",
    ", the central black hole may well be active ( i.e. , accreting ) , but its ionizing photon output is comparable to or weaker than that produced by holmes . for @xmath121 values between 1 and 2  , which are compatible with current models ( bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : ssps ] ) , one finds that at our proposed @xmath124   borderline the agn contributes between @xmath89 and 2/3 of the ionizing power .",
    "naturally , this fraction decreases even more as @xmath0 decreases , to the point that agn contribution is negligible for the bulk of the low @xmath125 population .",
    "it is therefore not correct to use the emission lines of @xmath10   systems to infer agn properties .",
    "we are now able to separate fake agn (= rgs ) from true agn . in the liner zone of fig . 1 , true agn are defined by 3 @xmath126  . to avoid confusion",
    ", we shall call these sources `` weak agn '' ( wagn ) . in the interest of a consistent notation",
    ", we shall also rename seyferts as `` strong agn '' ( sagn ) .",
    "finally , we remove from the sf category those galaxies consistent with a rg classification , that is to say those having @xmath10  .",
    "our final classification scheme is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : revised_ewhan2 ] .",
    "sample v sources split into percentage fractions of 22 , 21 , 8 , 31 and 18 sf , sagn , wagn , rg and pg , respectively .",
    "rgs therefore exist in large numbers in the sdss , in agreement with the basic prediction that such systems are bound to exits as a mere consequence of stellar evolution .",
    "agn , on the other hand , are far less common than one would infer associating all liners to non - stellar activity .",
    "this revised classification scheme has three main virtues :    1 .",
    "it identifies the three main ionizing agents in galaxies : young stars , agn and holmes .",
    "it is based on the cheapest and therefore most inclusive diagnostic diagram , the only one able to handle the huge population of weak line galaxies .",
    "in fact , it even allows us to visualize a region occupied by pgs , something which is not possible in conventional intensity ratio diagnostic diagrams ( of course , galaxies with no emission lines at all do not appear in this diagram ) .",
    "the sf / agn and wagn / sagn frontiers are based on optimal transpositions of widely used demarcation lines defined on the basis of traditional diagnostic diagrams , such that the whan diagram preserves traditional classification schemes where they work well , while at the same time fixing their inability to deal with weak line galaxies and to distinguish true from fake agn .    before exploring the realm of galaxies under the perspective of this new classification scheme , a few clarifications are in order .",
    "first , notice that our sf / agn border line corresponds to the transposition of the bpt - based criterion to isolate systems powered exclusively by young stars from those where a harder ionizing source is required .",
    "as such , it would have been better to call it a `` pure - sf '' demarcation line , instead of a `` sf / agn '' divisory line .",
    "this is all the more true now that we realize that the agn - like population of elgs in the bpt is full of retired galaxies whose black holes are not active enough to affect their emission lines .",
    "secondly , notice that the @xmath10   criterion slightly modifies our idealized definition of rgs as `` systems whose old stellar populations suffice to explain the observed emission line properties '' ( section [ sec : xi_model ] ) to one where holmes make at least a substantial contribution to the ionizing field .",
    "such a fuzzy frontier is unavoidable .",
    "our criterion is designed to avoid rgs being misclassified as agn . on the other hand",
    ", some galaxies hosting an agn , particularly those containing a weakly active nucleus , may drift to the @xmath10   zone if observed within an aperture larger than the sdss @xmath127 spectroscopic fiber .",
    "numerical experiments show that this is indeed likely to happen . picking the h@xmath1luminosity of a randomly chosen agn and adding it to the spectrum of a random _ bona fide _",
    "rg with @xmath0 within @xmath128  , we find that about 1/3 of the resulting simulated spectra have @xmath10  , most of which in the 23   range .",
    "we thus expect that a fraction of the systems here classified as rgs turn out to harbour weak agn when looked up more closely . at first sight",
    ", this seems to be a drawback of using @xmath0 for spectral classification , but it is not .",
    "after all , if an agn is present and yet @xmath10  , then it is still correct to infer that old stars make a substantial contribution to the observed line emission .",
    "finally , we note that the division of agn into strong and weak categories on the basis of @xmath0 is also to some extent aperture dependent , since sagn may be diluted to wagn as more stellar continuum is sampled .",
    "this , however , is a minor issue , since both classes are clearly agn - dominated systems , so there is no risk of misidentifying the dominant ionizing agent .",
    "a popular approach to digest the flood of information from mega - surveys like the sdss is to compare the properties of galaxies in different classes ( sf vs.  agn , seyfert vs.  liner , early vs.  late type , field vs.  cluster , etc . ) , in search of clues which may help understanding why galaxies are the way they are ( see @xcite for examples of studies following this general strategy ) .",
    "taxonomy , of course , plays a central role in such comparative studies . in this section",
    "we present yet another comparative study , but this time following the new taxonomical framework proposed in the previous section and summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : revised_ewhan2 ] .",
    "the main novelty in this scheme is the introduction of the rg category , whose members were previously misclassified as agn .",
    "a major goal of this section is to place rgs in the context of the galaxy population in general , which was never done before . on the one hand , we want to compare rgs with other elgs , especially wagn , with which rgs were so far confused .",
    "it is also interesting to compare wagn to sagn , since this division was merely introduced for the sake of `` backwards compatibility '' with the historical seyfert / liner sub - division of agns . on the other hand ,",
    "it is equally important to compare rgs and pgs .",
    "according to the rg concept , galaxies without emission lines should _ not exist _",
    ", since holmes provide a minimum floor ionizing field capable of powering emission lines . seen from this perspective , the existence of pgs raises questions like : are they truly line - less systems or is it just an issue of detectability ? perhaps pgs lack the warm / cold ism to reprocess ionizing photons ?",
    "the starlight - sdss database offers plenty of material for this comparative study . in what follows we use a suite of physical properties as well as the detailed star formation histories ( sfhs ) to address the issues raised above . only the volume limited sample",
    "is used from here on .    an instructive way to start this comparative study is to investigate how sfhs vary as a function of the sf / sagn / wagn / rg / pg spectral types defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : revised_ewhan2 ] .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfhs_on_ewhan2 ] where we chopped the whan diagram in @xmath129 dex wide bins in /h@xmath1and @xmath0 . in each box",
    "we plot the time - dependent median of the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) for galaxies in the box , colour coding the curves according to the fig .",
    "[ fig : revised_ewhan2 ] emission line taxonomy .",
    "the ssfr(t ) functions were smoothed exactly as in @xcite , which should be consulted for details on how this and other representations of starlight - based sfhs are derived .    because this is our classification diagram , most boxes contain only one curve , with exceptions at locations straddling the nominal frontier between rgs and wagn ( at @xmath124  ) and wagn / sagn ( @xmath25  ) .",
    "although there are strong systematic changes in sfhs across this plane , in these border - line cases one sees little difference between the sfhs of two adjacent classes .",
    "several trends are visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfhs_on_ewhan2 ] . for instance",
    ", focusing on the column centred at @xmath7 \\else [ n\\,{\\sc ii}]\\fi\\xspace}/{\\ifmmode { \\rm h}\\alpha \\else h$\\alpha$\\fi\\xspace}= -0.1 $ ] , one sees that both pgs and rgs have sfhs concentrated in the largest ages , while , moving upwards the retrieved sfhs reveal increasing levels of recent star - formation . due to the large apertures covered by the sdss fibers , most of the h@xmath1emission in these agn probably comes from star - formation rather than the agn ( e.g. *",
    "* ) , so the increase in recent ssfr with @xmath0 is expected .",
    "however , the effect of the agn is present , as can be inferred by the decreasing levels of recent ssfr towards the right for fixed @xmath0 ( best visible in the rows centred at @xmath130  ) .    before we proceed , a parenthesis must be opened to clarify the meaning of the small upturn in ssfr(t ) at @xmath131 yr for rgs and pgs .",
    "this feature is almost certainly an artifact of incomplete modelling of the horizontal branch phase @xcite .",
    "this effect was quantified by @xcite , who estimates that these `` fake young bursts '' account for up to 12% of the recovered optical light fractions in spectral synthesis of genuinely old stellar populations . in units of the ssfr",
    ", this corresponds to a few times @xmath132yr@xmath83 , which is precisely the level at which upturns at small ages are seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfhs_on_ewhan2 ] .",
    "we further find a clear trend for this artefact to be related to the stellar metallicity , with the low @xmath37 hump increasing for decreasing @xmath133 , in agreement with the fact that bluer horizontal branches occur for lower @xmath134 ( @xcite ; see also fig .",
    "[ fig : sfhs_on_m_x_smd ] for indirect evidence of this trend ) .",
    "finally , if the upturn were really due to young stars , @xmath0 should be much larger than observed . including these fake young bursts in the predictions for the ionizing flux leads to ( in the median ) expected @xmath0 values over 3 times as large as observed for rgs .",
    "the overprediction for pgs is even worse , with a median expected @xmath0 of 3.2  , while their definition requires @xmath86  .",
    "credible levels of recent star - formation only appear for boxes centred at @xmath135   in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfhs_on_ewhan2 ] , coinciding with the rg / wagn transition .",
    "this suggests that _ all _ agn are associated to at least some level of ongoing star - formation .",
    "while this is well known and documented for sagn ( the so called `` starburst - agn connection '' ) the situation is much less clear for wagn ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is difficult to compare this finding with those in previous studies because of varying definitions of wagn , but we can confidently say that the signatures of star formation in wagn identified in this work would be wiped out without removing the rgs from the agn category .    we now investigate how sfhs vary in terms of properties not explicitly involved in the definition of our spectral classes .",
    "[ fig : sfhs_on_m_x_smd ] shows sfhs in a stellar mass ( @xmath40 ) versus mass density ( @xmath136 ) diagram .",
    "this allows us to compare the sfhs of galaxies which are similar in terms of global properties , but differ in terms of emission line properties , since this time each box can contain galaxies of different classes . again , several trends are evident to the eye .",
    "one of them is the signature of downsizing , here manifested by the decrease in recent ssfr levels as one moves up the mass scale , seen , for instance , in the curves for sf galaxies in the 1@xmath137 two columns of boxes .",
    "a similar behaviour is also seen for rgs and pgs yr are not real , but artifacts of spectral fits with an incomplete base @xcite . the fact that these fake bursts correlate with galaxy mass , as seen in fig .",

    "[ fig : sfhs_on_m_x_smd ] is that in every box the lines corresponding to our different classes appear in the same order , with recent star formation decreasing from sf galaxies to sagn , wagn , rgs and pgs .",
    "these last two , in fact , have median sfhs which are very similar and sometimes indistinguishable .",
    "both types retired from forming stars over @xmath29 yr ago .",

    "the distributions for wagn are more similar to the ones of sagn , suggesting that these galaxies belong to the same family .",
    "this is a salutary a posteriori validation of our splitting of liners into two very different classes : rgs and wagn .",

    "an investigation of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper , but we note that this `` contaminant '' population tends to have @xmath0 close to the rg / wagn frontier , and thus may be related to the unavoidable fuzziness of classification schemes .    in terms of",

    "the goal of this paper was to provide a comprehensive classification of galaxies according to their emission line properties which would be able to cope with the large population of weak line galaxies that do not appear in traditional diagrams ( e.g. , bpt ) because they lack some of the diagnostic lines .",
    "this is possible using the whan diagram ( @xmath0 vs /h@xmath1 ) that we proposed in earlier work .",
    "an additional problem with the bpt diagram and other similar line - ratio diagrams is that , as shown by @xcite , the liner region contains a mix of two completely different families of galaxies : galaxies that contain a weak agn and `` retired galaxies '' , i.e. galaxies that have stopped forming stars and whose emission lines are powered by their hot evolved low - mass stars ( holmes ) .",
    "a truly comprehensive classification scheme must account for this phenomenon , and the whan diagram allows so .    to distinguish true agn from fake ones ( i.e. , the rgs ) ,",
    "we have shown that a useful criterion is the value of @xmath2 , which measures the intrinsic extinction - corrected h@xmath1  luminosity in units of the h@xmath1  luminosity expected from stellar populations older than @xmath3yr uncovered by our stellar population analysis software starlight . in principle",
    ", @xmath2 should be equal to one if the galaxy absorbs all the ionizing photons provided by its holmes , and @xmath152 if any other source of ionization is present .",
    "we have shown that this index is bimodally distributed , with a @xmath4 population composed by galaxies undergoing vigorous star - formation and/or nuclear activity , and a population of galaxies centred right at the predicted value for rgs .",
    "computing @xmath2 for each galaxy , however , is not a trivial task : it requires a stellar population analysis able to identify the populations of holmes and a recipe to obtain the ionizing radiation field from these holmes .",
    "the latter strongly depends on how the ( yet quite uncertain ) evolutionary tracks for post - asymptotic giant branch stars are incorporated into the stellar population codes as well as on other issues such as the imf and the metallicities of the stellar populations .",
    "it is therefore preferable to base the distinction between true and fake agn on the h@xmath1  equivalent width , an easy to obtain observational parameter which provides an excellent proxy for @xmath2 . in view of the strong dichotomy in the observed @xmath0 distribution for galaxies in the right wing of the bpt diagram ( i.e. , the wing previously supposed to contain only agn )",
    ", we propose a practical separation between weak agn and rgs based on a class frontier at @xmath6  .",
    "this physically inspired but data - guided separation corresponds to the minimum between the two modes in the @xmath0 distribution .",

    "<S> we use the @xmath0 versus /h@xmath1(whan ) diagram introduced by us in previous work to provide a comprehensive emission - line classification of sloan digital sky survey galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this classification is able to cope with the large population of weak line galaxies that do not appear in traditional diagrams due to a lack of some of the diagnostic lines . </S>",
    "<S> a further advantage of the whan diagram is to allow the differentiation between two very distinct classes that overlap in the liner region of traditional diagnostic diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> these are galaxies hosting a weakly active galactic nucleus ( wagn ) and `` retired galaxies '' ( rgs ) , i.e. galaxies that have stopped forming stars and are ionized by their _ hot evolved low - mass stars _ ( holmes ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a useful criterion to distinguish true from fake agn ( i.e. the rgs ) is the value of @xmath2 , which measures the ratio of the extinction - corrected h@xmath1  luminosity with respect to the h@xmath1  luminosity expected from photoionization by stellar populations older than @xmath3yr . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath2 follows a markedly bimodal distribution , with a @xmath4 population composed by systems undergoing star - formation and/or nuclear activity , and a peak at @xmath5 corresponding to the prediction of the rg model . </S>",
    "<S> we base our classification scheme not on @xmath2 but on a more readily available and model - independent quantity which provides an excellent observational proxy for @xmath2 : the equivalent width of h@xmath1 . based on the bimodal distribution of @xmath0 , we set the practical division between wagn and rgs at @xmath6  .    </S>",
    "<S> five classes of galaxies are identified within the whan diagram :    * pure star forming galaxies : @xmath7 \\else [ n\\,{\\sc ii}]\\fi\\xspace}/{\\ifmmode { \\rm h}\\alpha \\else h$\\alpha$\\fi\\xspace}\\ < -0.4 $ ] and @xmath8  * strong agn ( i.e. , seyferts ) : @xmath7 \\else [ n\\,{\\sc ii}]\\fi\\xspace}/{\\ifmmode { \\rm h}\\alpha \\else h$\\alpha$\\fi\\xspace}\\ > -0.4 $ ] and @xmath9  * weak agn : @xmath7 \\else [ n\\,{\\sc ii}]\\fi\\xspace}/{\\ifmmode { \\rm h}\\alpha \\else h$\\alpha$\\fi\\xspace}\\ > -0.4 $ ] and @xmath0 between 3 and 6  * retired galaxies ( i.e. , fake agn ) : @xmath10  * passive galaxies ( actually , line - less galaxies ) : @xmath0 and @xmath11 \\else [ n\\,{\\sc ii}]\\fi\\xspace } } < 0.5 $ ]     a comparative analysis of star formation histories and of other physical and observational properties in these different classes of galaxies corroborates our proposed differentiation between rgs and weak agn in the liner - like family . this analysis also shows similarities between strong and weak agn on the one hand , and retired and passive galaxies on the other .    galaxies : active  galaxies : stellar content  galaxies : evolution  galaxies : statistics </S>"
