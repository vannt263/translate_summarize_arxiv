    "back to 1960s , two most influential mathematics papers @xcite , @xcite have been published in asme s journal of basic engineering . these are so - called kalman filter ( kf ) and kalman - bucy filter .",
    "they addressed a significant question : how does one get accurate estimate from noisy data ?",
    "the applications of kf are endless , from seismology to bioengineering to econometrics .",
    "the kf surpasses the other filtering in , at least , the following two aspects :    * the kf uses each new obervation to update a probability distribution for the state of the system without refering back to any earlier observations .",
    "this is so - called  memoryless \" or  without memory \" .",
    "* the kf makes the decisions of the state on the spot , while the observation data keep coming in .",
    "this property is called  real time \" application .    despite its success in many real applications , the limitations on the nonlinearity and gaussian assumption of the initial probability density of the kf",
    "push the mathematicians and scientists to seek the optimal nonlinear filtering .",
    "one direction is to modify kf to adapt the nonlinearities .",
    "the researchers developed extended kalman filter ( ekf ) , unscented kalman filter , ensemble kalman filter , etc . , which can handle weak nonlinearities ( that is almost linear ) .",
    "but for serious nonlinearities , they may completely fail .",
    "the failure of ekf is shown in our numerical experiment , see the 1d cubic sensor in section vii.a .",
    "another direction , and also the most popular method nowadays , is the particle filter ( pf ) , refer to as @xcite , @xcite and reference therein .",
    "it is developed from sequential monte carlo method .",
    "on the one hand , the pf is appliable to nonlinear , non - gaussian state update and observation equations . as the number of particles goes to infinity ,",
    "the pf estimate becomes asymptotically optimal . on the other hand ,",
    "it is hard to be implemented as a real time application , due to its essence of monte carlo simulation .    besides the widely used two methods above , the partial differential equaitons ( pde ) methods",
    "are introduced to the nonlinear filtering in 1960s .",
    "these methods are based on the fact that the unnormalized conditional density of the states is the solution of duncan - mortensen - zakai ( dmz ) equation , refer to as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the classical pde methods could be applied to this stochastic pde to obtain an approximation to the density . yet , the main drawback of pde methods are the intensive computation .",
    "it is almost impossible to achieve the ",
    "real time \" performance . to overcome this shortcoming ,",
    "the splitting - up algorithm is introduced to move the heavy computation off - line .",
    "it is like the trotter product formula from semigroup theory .",
    "this operator splitting algorithm is proposed for the dmz equation by bensoussan , glowinski , and rascanu @xcite .",
    "more research articles follow this direction are @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , etc .",
    "unfortunately , it is pointed out in @xcite that the soundness of this algorithm is verified only to the filtering with bounded drift term and observation term ( i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in ( [ ito sde ] ) ) . essentially with the similar idea , yau and",
    "yau @xcite developed a novel algorithm to the  pathwise - robust \" dmz equation ( see ( [ robust dmz eqn expansion ] ) ) , where the boundedness conditions are weakened by some mild growth conditions on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the two nice properties of the kf have also been kept in this algorithm :  without memory \" and  real time \" .",
    "but their algorithm has only been rigorously proved in theory , when the drift term , the observation term ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 in ) are not explicitly dependent on time , the variance of the noises ( @xmath3 in ) is the identity matrix , and the noises are standard brownian motion processes ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 in ) .    in this paper",
    ", we shall extend the algorithm in @xcite to the most general settings of nonlinear filtering problems , in the sense that the drift term , the observation term could explicitly depend on time , the variance of the noises @xmath6 , @xmath7 are time - dependent , and @xmath3 could be a matrix of functions of both time and the states .",
    "we shall validate our algorithm under very mild growth conditions on @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , see , and .",
    "these are essentially time - dependent analogue of those in @xcite .",
    "first of all , this extension is absolutely necessary .",
    "many real applications have explicit time - dependence in their models , say the target orientation angles estimation from target position / velocity in constant turn model , where the angular velocities are piecewise constant functions in time @xcite .",
    "second , this extension is nontrivial from the mathematical point of view .",
    "more trickier analysis of pde is required .",
    "for instance , we need to take care of the more general elliptic operator @xmath8 , see ( 2.5 ) , rather than the laplacian .",
    "this paper is organized in the following .",
    "the detailed formulation of our algorithm is described in section ii ; in section iii , we state our main theorems which validate our algorithm in theory .",
    "notations and prelimilary are in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to the proofs of the main theorems .",
    "the lower bound of the density function is investigated in section vi .",
    "numerical simulations are included in section vii .",
    "finally , we arrive the conclusion .",
    "the appendices is consisted of the proof of the well - posedness theorem and the proof of an interesting property of the density function .",
    "the model we are considering is the signal observation model with explicit time - dependence in the drift term , observation term and the variance of the noises : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath1 are @xmath11-vectors , @xmath3 is an @xmath12 matrix , and @xmath13 is an @xmath14-vector brownian motion process with @xmath15=q(t)dt$ ] , @xmath16 and @xmath2 are @xmath17-vectors and @xmath18 is an @xmath17-vector brownian motion process with @xmath19=s(t)dt$ ] and @xmath20 .",
    "we refer to @xmath10 as the state of the system at time @xmath21 with some initial state @xmath22 ( not necessarily obeying gaussian distribution ) and @xmath16 as the observation at time @xmath21 with @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath22 are independent .",
    "for the sake of convenience , let us call this system is the  time - varying \" case , while in @xcite the  time - invariant \" case is studied .    throughout this paper , we assume that @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are @xmath26 in space and @xmath27 in time . some growth conditions on @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "are expected to guaratee the existence and uniqueness of the  pathwise - robust \" dmz equation .",
    "the unnormalized density function @xmath28 of @xmath10 conditioned on the observation history @xmath29 satisfies the dmz equation ( for the detailed formulation , see @xcite ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the probability density of the initial state @xmath22 , and @xmath32-\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{\\partial(f_i\\ast)}{\\partial      x_i}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this paper , we do nt solve the dmz equation directly , due to the following two reasons . on the one hand ,",
    "the dmz equation ( [ dmz eqn ] ) is a stochastic partial differential equation due to the term @xmath33 .",
    "there is no easy way to derive a recursive algorithm to solve this equation . on the other hand , in real applications ,",
    "one may be more interested in constructing robust state estimators from each observation path , instead of having certain statistical data of thousands of repeated experiments .",
    "here , the robustness means our state esitmator is not sensitive to the observation path .",
    "this property is important , since in most of the real applications , the observation arrives and is processed at discrete moments in time .",

    "generally speaking , does nt have a closed form .",
    "so many mathematicians pay their effort on seeking an efficient algorithm to construct a good approximation .",

    ". we will not only give the theoretical proof of the soundness of our algorithm , but also illustrate a  time - varying \" numerical simulation to support our results .",
