    "in our present understanding of the thermodynamics @xcite and the finite temperature correlation functions@xcite of the xxz quantum spin chain certain complex valued functions defined as solutions of linear or non - linear integral equations play an important role . in first place",
    "we have to mention the so - called auxiliary function @xmath3 , satisfying the non - linear integral equation @xmath4 here @xmath5 sets the energy scale of the spin chain , @xmath6 is the temperature , and @xmath7 controls the anisotropy and the quantum group parameter @xmath8 . for simplicity we shall assume throughout that @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this means to consider the xxz chain in the critical regime . ] .",
    "the bare energy @xmath11 and the kernel @xmath12 are defined as @xmath13 the integration contour @xmath14 encircles the real axis at a distance slightly smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "the twist parameter @xmath16 is proportional to the magnetic field @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the auxiliary function @xmath3 determines the free energy per lattice site , @xmath19 of the spin chain and , hence , all its thermodynamic properties .",
    "this explains the importance of @xmath3 .",
    "the magnetization , for instance , is defined as @xmath20 it has a simple expression in terms of the logarithmic derivative of the auxiliary function , @xmath21 namely , @xmath22 the function @xmath23 satisfies the linear integral equation @xmath24 its zero temperature limit @xmath25 is called the dressed charge .",
    "it plays an important role in the calculation of the asymptotics of correlation functions at @xmath26 . for the lack of any better name we shall call @xmath23 , and also an @xmath27-generalization of @xmath23 to be considered below , the dressed charge as well .",
    "another possibility of expressing the magnetization per lattice site ( [ msdens ] ) is by means of a magnetization density @xmath28 satisfying @xmath29 applying the ` dressed function trick ' to ( [ intsigma ] ) and ( [ intg ] ) we obtain @xmath30    the integrability of the xxz chain manifests itself in the existence of commuting families of transfer matrices and @xmath1-operators of the associated six - vertex model @xcite . with an appropriate staggered choice of the horizontal spectral parameters the partition function of the six - vertex model on a rectangular lattice approximates the partition function of the xxz chain @xcite . the approximation becomes exact in the so - called trotter limit , when the extension of the lattice in vertical direction goes to infinity . by a modification of the boundary conditions in vertical direction",
    "we can also obtain an expression for the density matrix of a finite segment of the spin chain @xcite .",
    "the column - to - column transfer matrix in this approach is called the quantum transfer matrix .",
    "it satisfies a @xmath2-@xmath1-equation as well , which becomes a functional equation for the eigenvalues of the involved operators due to their commutativity .",
    "we denote the dominant eigenvalue of the quantum transfer matrix by @xmath31 .",
    "this eigenvalue alone determines the free energy in the thermodynamic limit , when the horizontal extension of the lattice tends to infinity , @xmath32 .",
    "let the corresponding @xmath1-function be @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath34 and @xmath1 satisfy the @xmath2-@xmath1-equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the pseudo vacuum eigenvalues of the diagonal entries of the monodromy matrix associated with the quantum transfer matrix , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    using the @xmath1-functions corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue",
    "the auxiliary function @xmath3 can be expressed as @xmath40 in fact , the auxiliary function @xmath3 is usually defined by ( [ aqq ] ) , and afterwards it is shown that @xmath3 satisfies the non - linear integral equation ( [ nlietemhom ] ) in the trotter limit . to be more precise , the @xmath1-functions , the transfer matrix eigenvalue and the vacuum expectation values depend implicitly on the trotter number @xmath41 .",
    "hence , @xmath3 as defined in ( [ aqq ] ) depends on @xmath41 . one can show that it satisfies the non - linear integral equation @xmath42^\\frac{n}{2 }          - \\int_{c } \\frac{\\rd \\m}{2 \\p \\i } \\ ,            k(\\la - \\m ) \\ln ( 1 + \\fa ( \\m|\\k ) ) \\epp\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] clearly this turns into ( [ nlietemhom ] ) for @xmath43 . the integral equation ( [ nlietemhom ] )",
    "is the reason why the function @xmath3 is more useful for practical purposes than @xmath1 .",
    "it is hard to determine @xmath1 , and @xmath1 has no simple trotter limit . on the other hand , ( [ nlietemhom ] )",
    "determines @xmath3 directly in the trotter limit and can be converted into a form that can be accurately solved numerically .    inserting ( [ aqq ] ) into ( [ defsigma ] )",
    "we obtain an expression for the dressed charge function in terms of logarithmic derivatives of @xmath1-functions . @xmath44 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath16 . for",
    "the function @xmath28 defined in ( [ intg ] ) no such simple expression in terms of @xmath1-functions is known .    below we shall introduce generalizations of the functions @xmath23 and @xmath28",
    "that depend on additional parameters .",
    "for the generalized dressed charge we will derive a generalization of ( [ sigmazero ] ) .",
    "this will be used in a derivation of the asymptotic behaviour of the generalized magnetization density as a function of the spectral parameter .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that all correlation functions of the xxz chain regularized by a disorder parameter @xmath27 can be expressed in terms of two functions , the ratio of eigenvalues @xmath45 and a function @xmath46 with the essential part @xmath47 that can be characterized in terms of solutions of certain @xmath27-dependent linear integral equations @xcite .",
    "a thorough understanding of these two functions is of fundamental importance for the further study of the correlation functions of the xxz chain and for the application of the lattice results to quantum field theory in various scaling limits @xcite .",
    "we define the ` measure ' @xmath48 and the deformed kernel @xmath49 then , for @xmath50 inside @xmath14 the function @xmath28 is , by definition , the solution of the integral equation @xmath51 clearly @xmath28 is a generalization of the magnetization density ( [ intg ] ) that depends on an additional spectral parameter and on the disorder parameter @xmath27 . for simplicity",
    "we keep the same notation also for the generalized function .",
    "@xmath28 enters the definition of @xmath52 which , for @xmath53 inside @xmath14 , is defined as @xmath54 for @xmath50 or @xmath55 , @xmath56 outside the contour , @xmath28 and @xmath52 are given by the analytic continuations of the right and side of ( [ newg ] ) or ( [ psi ] ) , respectively .",
    "asymptotic behaviour of @xmath28 and @xmath52 as a functions of the spectral parameters .",
    "1 .   @xmath57 2 .",
    "@xmath58       & \\lim_{\\re \\n_2 \\rightarrow \\infty } \\ps ( \\n_1 , \\n_2 ) =          - \\frac{q^\\a - \\r ( \\n_1)}{1 + q^{- 2 \\k } } \\epp \\label{asymppsi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we may choose the contour @xmath14 as the rectangular contour of hight slightly less than @xmath59 and of width @xmath60 depicted in figure  [ fig : kontur ] .",
    "@xmath61 must be sufficiently large to include all bethe roots .",
    "this is trivially possible for finite trotter number , but also in trotter limit @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "then the right hand side of ( [ newg ] ) is holomorphic in @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "it follows that @xmath64 here the the second equation will appear as lemma [ lem : onep ] below .",
    "we postpone the proof , because it needs some preparation .    for the calculation of the asymptotics of @xmath28 for large @xmath65 we have to take into account that @xmath66 as a function of @xmath62 has pole at @xmath67 with residue @xmath68 .",
    "hence , for @xmath50 outside @xmath14 , @xmath69 using that @xmath70 and setting @xmath71 we obtain from ( [ newgcont ] ) @xmath72 then @xmath73 , and ( [ limg ] ) is proved .    a similar argument can be applied to prove ( [ asymppsi2 ] ) . for @xmath56 outside @xmath14",
    "we have @xmath74 using the second equation ( [ limg ] ) and ( [ limrhoa ] ) we obtain ( [ asymppsi2 ] ) .    for the proof of ( [ asymppsi1 ] ) we note that @xmath75 if @xmath55 is outside @xmath14 . using ( [ limg1 ] )",
    "we conclude that @xmath76 thus , ( [ asymppsi1 ] ) follows by means of ( [ limg ] ) .    here",
    "a few comments are in order . for the correlation functions of the xxz chain ,",
    "@xcite it is actually not the function @xmath52 but the closely related function @xmath46 was used . ] which is at the heart of the theory @xmath77 where @xmath78 with @xmath79 should be understood as in ( 2.10 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . using the explicit form of the function @xmath80 and the above lemma ( 2.1 )",
    "one can see that @xmath81 this is one of normalization conditions for @xmath46 introduced in @xcite .",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath28 and @xmath82 with respect to the first argument was derived in @xcite .",
    "the reasoning there was also based on the second equation ( [ limg1 ] ) , which was obtained rather indirectly by means of the reduction property of the density matrix and a multiple integral representation for the six - vertex model with disorder parameter .",
    "below we shall present a more direct proof of it in lemma [ lem : onep ] , based on a representation of the generalized dressed charge in terms of @xmath1-functions .",
    "perhaps the simplest proof of lemma [ lem : onep ] utilizes the symmetry",
    "@xcite @xmath83 if we combine this with @xmath84 , then ( [ asymppsi1 ] ) follows from ( [ asymppsi2 ] ) .",
    "but ( [ asymppsi1 ] ) inserted into ( [ asymppsig1 ] ) implies @xmath85 , and lemma [ lem : onep ] follows with the first equation ( [ limg1 ] ) .",
    "still , this is a little indirect and unsatisfactory .",
    "here we are going for a more direct proof based upon the properties of the dressed charge function defined by @xmath86    [ lem : sigma ] dressed charge in terms of @xmath1-functions .",
    "@xmath87 where @xmath88    we recall from the appendix of @xcite that @xmath89 where the @xmath90 are the bethe roots of the dominant eigenstate of the quantum transfer matrix which are located inside the contour @xmath14 . due to the @xmath2-@xmath1-equation ( [ tq ] )",
    "@xmath91 here the first term on the right hand side is holomorphic inside @xmath14 .",
    "hence , @xmath92 the latter integral can be calculated .",
    "note that @xmath93 and @xmath94 with the contours sketched in figure [ fig : kontur ] it follows that @xmath95       = q^{- \\a } \\phi ( \\la + \\h ) - q^\\a \\phi ( \\la - \\h ) +         \\int_c \\frac{\\rd \\m}{2 \\p \\i } \\",
    ", \\phi ( \\m ) k_\\a ( \\m - \\la ) \\epp\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here we have used the periodicity ( [ period ] ) in the first equation , the fact that the integral is independent of @xmath61 and the asymptotics ( [ asymptotics ] ) in the second equation , and the fact that @xmath96 is free of poles inside @xmath97 in the third equation . setting @xmath98 and combining ( [ id1 ] ) and ( [ id2 ] ) we obtain ( [ sigmaphi ] ) .",
    "contours used in the proofs of lemma [ lem : sigma ] and lemma [ lem : onep ] . ]",
    "it remains to show the second equation ( [ defssigmaphi ] ) .",
    "it follows from @xmath99 and the proof is complete .",
    "clearly ( [ sigmaphi ] ) turns into ( [ sigmazero ] ) in the limit @xmath100 .",
    "equipped with lemma [ lem : sigma ] we can now proceed with proving    [ lem : onep ] an identity for one - point functions .",
    "@xmath101    first of all applying the dressed function trick to ( [ newg ] ) and ( [ newsigma ] ) we obtain @xmath102 then we insert ( [ sigmaphi ] ) and ( [ id0 ] ) into the right hand side .",
    "it follows that @xmath103 & \\mspace{36.mu } \\int_c \\frac{\\rd \\la}{2 \\p \\i }          \\biggl(\\phi ( \\la ) - \\frac{q^{- \\a } \\phi ( \\la + \\h)}{\\r ( \\la ) }                 \\biggr ) \\bigl ( q^{-\\a } \\operatorname{cth}(\\la - \\n - \\h )                                - \\r ( \\n ) \\operatorname{cth}(\\la - \\n ) \\bigr ) =          \\displaybreak[0 ] \\notag \\\\          & = \\frac{1}{\\phi_0 ( q^\\a - q^{- \\a } ) }",

    "we would like to conclude with three more remarks .",
    "first , all the above remains valid if we consider a more general six - vertex model with a more general inhomogeneous choice of parameters in vertical direction . in that case the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 in ( [ detpara ] ) and also the driving term in ( [ nlien ] ) have to be modified as in @xcite .",
    "second , in reference @xcite the calculation of the limit @xmath104 was the only point , where we had to resort to a multiple integral representation , when we showed that the functions @xmath46 as defined in references @xcite and @xcite are identical . with the proof presented in this note",
    "the approach to the correlation functions of the xxz chain , based on the discovery of a hidden grassmann symmetry , as developed in @xcite becomes logically independent of the multiple integral representation that was also obtained in @xcite .",
    "third , the function @xmath96 used above to express @xmath23 seems quite interesting and may deserve further attention .",
    "is it possible to express the solutions of other linear integral equations in terms of @xmath96 ? and is there a useful integral equation for @xmath96 itself ?",
    "we hope we can come back to these questions in the future .",
    "it a great pleasure and honour to dedicate this note to our dear friend tetsuji miwa on the occasion of his 60th birthday .",
    "we are grateful to fedor smirnov for suggesting us to prove lemma [ lem : onep ] directly .",
    "we wish to thank alexander seel for drawing the figure for us .",
    "our work was generously supported by the volkswagen foundation ."
