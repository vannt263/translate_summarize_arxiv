    "the rise of hadronic total cross - sections @xmath0 with energy , has been now observed for a set of comparable values of where both a , b are hadrons  @xcite , when one of them is a photon  @xcite and when both of them are photons  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that interactions of a photon with another hadron or photon receive contributions from the ` structure ' of a photon which the photon develops due to its fluctuation into a virtual @xmath1 pair .",
    "the recent measurements  @xcite of  at higher energies of upto and beyond @xmath2 gev , have confirmed that the hadronic cross - sections rise with  and preliminary claims  @xcite are that they rise faster than the @xmath3 cross - sections .",
    "a measurement of @xmath4 cross - sections by zeus collaboration , extrapolated to @xmath5 @xcite , lies above the photoproduction measurements  @xcite .",
    "these extrapolated @xmath4 data and the new  data seem to indicate that the rise of cross - sections with gets faster as one replaces hadrons with photons successively . in the pomeron - regge picture  @xcite the total cross - section is given by ^tot_ab = y_ab s^-+x_abs^ [ regpom ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are related to the intercept at zero of the leading regge trajectory and of the pomeron , respectively .",
    "the value of the pomeron intercept indicated by the unpublished results of zeus  @xcite is @xmath8 whereas the corresponding value for the  data obtained by the l3 collaboration  @xcite is @xmath9 which is to be compared with the value of @xmath10  @xcite for pure hadronic cross - sections .",
    "[ figure1 ] shows the energy dependence of the hadronic cross - sections as well as those for the photon induced processes .",
    "the latter are multiplied by a quark model motivated factor of @xmath11 and the inverse of the probability for a photon to fluctuate into a @xmath1 pair : .",
    "the value chosen for  is @xmath12 which is close to a value motivated by vmd picture .",
    "i.e. @xmath13 fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] illustrates that _ all _ total cross - sections show a similar rise in energy when the difference between photon and hadron is taken into account , albeit with indications of somewhat steeper energy dependence for photon induced processes .",
    "the similarity in the energy dependence makes it interesting to attempt to give a description of all three data sets in the same theoretical framework@xcite .",
    "we have analysed the cross - sections for photon - induced processes alone  @xcite and we find that the emm calculations generically predict faster rise with  for  case than would be expected by an universal pomeron hypothesis .",
    "i will further present arguments why in the framework of emm the pomeron intercept is expected to increase as the number of colliding photons in the process increase .",
    "there are some basic differences between the purely hadronic cross - section measurements and those of the total cross - sections in photon induced processes . in the purely hadronic case",
    "the measurement of the total cross - section comes from the combined methods of extrapolation of the elastic diffraction peak and total event count , whereas in the case of photon induced processes , this has to be extracted from the data using a montecarlo ; for example the total  cross - sections are extracted from a measurement of hadron production in the untagged   interactions .",
    "experimentally this gives rise to different types of uncertainites in the measurement .",
    "theoretically , the concept of the ` elastic ' cross - section can not be well defined for the photons . in models satisfying unitarity like those which use the eikonal formulation ,",
    "it is important to understand what is the definition of the elastic cross - section and if the data include all of this elastic cross - section or part or a small fraction . to that end",
    "let us summarise some of the basic features of the eikonal formulation .",
    "let us start from the very beginning .",
    "consider the eikonal formulation for the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath14 \\label{elsc}\\ ] ] which , together with the optical theorem leads to the expression for the total cross - sections @xmath15 \\\\",
    "\\label{eik2 } \\sigma^{\\rm inel}&=&\\sigma^{\\rm tot}-\\sigma^{\\rm el}=\\int d^2{\\vec b } [ 1-e^{-\\chi_i(b , s ) } ] \\label{eik3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the minijet model@xcite the rise of total cross - sections can be calculated from qcd . in the model , there is an _",
    "ad hoc _ sharp division between a soft component , which is of non - perturbative origin and for which the model is not able to make theoretical predictions , and a hard component , which receives input from perturbative qcd .",
    "the minijet model assumes that the rise with energy of total cross - sections is driven by the rise with energy of the number of low - x partons ( gluons ) responsible for hadron collisions and in its simplest formulation reads @xmath16 the superscript @xmath17 indicating that this is the ununitarised cross - section .",
    "this concept can be embodied in a unitary formulation as in [ eik1]-[eik3 ] , by writing @xcite @xmath18 \\label{siginel}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 \\label{numb}\\ ] ] in eq.[siginel ] , we have inserted , to include the generalization to photon processes , a factor @xmath20 defined as the probability that particles @xmath21 and @xmath22 behave like hadrons in the collision .",
    "this parameter is unity for hadron - hadron processes , but of order @xmath23 or @xmath24 for processes with respectively one or two photons in the initial state .",
    "the definition of @xmath25 in eq.[numb ] is such that , even in the photonic case , it is of hadronic size , just like @xmath26 . a simple way to understand the need for this factor",
    "@xcite is to realise that the unitarisation in this formalism is achieved by multiple parton interactions in a given scatter of hadrons and once the photon has ` hadronised ' itself , one should not be paying the price of  for further multiparton scatters .    at high energies ,",
    "the dominant term in the eikonal is the @xmath27 cross - section which is calculable in qcd and depends on the parton densities in the colliding particles and @xmath28 , which admittedly is an ad hoc parameter separating the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions to the eikonal .",
    "the basic assumption in arriving at eq .",
    "[ siginel ] is that the multiple parton scatters responsible for the unitarisation are independent of each other at a given value of @xmath22 . in this model @xmath29 in eq .",
    "[ numb ] , is identified as the average number of collisions at any given energy  and impact parameter @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath22 dependence is assumed to be given by the function @xmath30 which is modelled in different ways .",
    "this function measures the overlap of the partons in the two hadrons @xmath31 in the transverse plane .    before going to the discussion of different models of @xmath32",
    ", we note that the mini - jet model is particularly well suited for generalisation to the photon - induced processes where the concept of ` elastic ' cross - section is not very well defined .",
    "whereas for the hadronic case one starts from the elastic amplitude followed by the optical theorem as done in eqs .",
    "  [ eik3 ] , in this case the starting point is actually the eq .",
    "[ siginel ] and then one defines @xmath33 using eq .",
    "[ eik2 ] with @xmath34 and using @xmath35 as given by [ siginel ] .",
    "the above discussion specifies the total cross - section formulation of the emm for photon - induced processes .",
    "while our earlier analyses  @xcite assumed that the  cross - sections presented were the inelastic cross - sections , the analyis of @xcite had used the total cross - section formulation but with a different ansatz for the eikonal .",
    "our analysis uses the total cross - section formulation of the emm with the perturbative part of the eikonal as given by qcd _",
    "a - la _ eq .",
    "[ siginel ] .",
    "the overlap function @xmath30 is normally calculated in terms of the convolution of the matter distributions @xmath36of the partons in the colliding hadrons in the transverse plane @xmath37 if we assume that the @xmath38 is given by fourier transform of the form factor of the hadron , then @xmath32 is given by , @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the electromagnetic form factors of the colliding hadrons . for protons this",
    "is given by the dipole expression @xmath41 ^ 2,\\ ] ] with @xmath42 .",
    "for photons a number of authors @xcite , on the basis of vector meson dominance , have assumed the same functional form as for pion , i.e. the pole expression @xmath43 with @xmath44 gev from the measured pion form factors , changing the value of the scale parameter @xmath45 , if necessary in order to fit the data .    yet",
    "another philosophy would be to assume that the b - space distribution of partons is the fourier transform of the transverse momentum distribution of the colliding system  @xcite .",
    "to leading order , this transverse momentum distribution can be entirely due to an intrinsic transverse momentum of partons in the parent hadron .",
    "while the intrinsic transverse momentum ( @xmath46 ) distribution of partons in a proton is normally taken to be gaussian , a choice which can be justified in qcd based models @xcite , in the case of photon the origin of all partons can , in principle , be traced back to the hard vertex @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , also in the intrinsic transverse momentum philosophy , one can expect the @xmath46 distribution of photonic partons to be different from that of the partons in the proton .",
    "the expected functional dependence can be deduced using the origin of photonic partons from the @xmath48 splitting . for",
    "the photon one can argue that the intrinsic transverse momentum anstze would imply the use of a different value of the parameter @xmath45",
    "@xcite , which is extracted from data involving ` resolved '  @xcite photon interactions  @xcite , in the pole expression for the form factor . by varying @xmath45 one",
    "can then explore various possibilities , i.e. the @xmath49 hypothesis if @xmath50 gev , or the intrinsic transverse distribution case for other values of @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "the ansatz of eqs .",
    "[ eik1]  [ eik3 ] and [ numb ] , requires that the overlap function be normalised to unity , i.e. , d^2 b a_ab(b ) = 1 . taking the form factor ansatz for the proton",
    "we then have @xmath51 and @xmath52   + { { k_0 ^ 2\\nu^2}\\over{4 \\pi(k_0 ^ 2-\\nu^2)}}\\nu b { \\cal k}_1(\\nu b ) \\label{agmp}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath45 are the scale factors mentioned earlier and @xmath54 are the modified bessel functions .    if we look at eqs .",
    "[ siginel]-  [ numb ] it is easy to see that @xmath30 and @xmath55 always appear in the combination @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "hence only one of them can be varied independently .",
    "note also that @xmath57 can always be renormalised since it is a function fitted to the low energy data . by looking at eq .",
    "[ numb ] we can see that if the @xmath58-dependence of the @xmath27 cross - sections were similar for _ all _ the colliding particles , then the difference in the @xmath58-dependece of the total / inelastic cross - sections can be estimated by looking at the behaviour of @xmath59 . it is also clear then that changing the scale parameter @xmath45 in @xmath30 is equivalent to changing @xmath60 .",
    "note also that p_^had = p_^had ; p_^had = ( p_^had)^2 . hence ,",
    "in analysing the photon - induced reactions , i.e , the and  cross - sections , the only hadronisation probability that is an independent parameter is @xmath61 .",
    "thus now we are ready to list the total number of inputs on which the emm predictions depend :    * the soft cross - sections @xmath62 , * @xmath28 and the parton densities in the colliding hadrons , *  and the ansatz as well as the scale parameters for the @xmath30 ,    out of these the protonic and photonic parton densities are known from @xmath63 and @xmath64 dis .",
    "the nonperturbative part @xmath65 has to be determined from some fits .",
    "we outline the procedure used by us below .",
    "it is true that the jet cross - sections of eq .",
    "[ miniold ] depend very strongly on the value of @xmath28",
    ". hence it would be useful to have an independent information of this parameter , which as said before separates the perturbative and nonperturbative contribution in an ad hoc manner .",
    "luckily , there is more direct evidence that the ansatz of eq .",
    "[ siginel ] can describe some features of hadronic interactions .",
    "event generators which have built in multiple parton interactions in a given @xmath66 interaction , for the case of @xmath31 being @xmath67 , were shown  @xcite to explain many features of the hadronic interactions such as multiplicity distributions with a @xmath28 around @xmath68 gev .",
    "recent analyses of the  interactions seem to show  @xcite again that a consistent description of many features such as energy flow , multiplicity distributions is possible with a @xmath28 value between @xmath68  @xmath69 gev .    the energy dependence of @xmath70 as defined in eq .  [ miniold ]",
    "will of course get reflected in the energy rise of the eikonalised total or inelastic cross - section .",
    "it is therefore instructive to see how this depends on the type of the colliding particles .",
    "we compare this for @xmath3 ,  and  case , where we have multiplied the  and jet cross - sections by factor of @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively .    in the comparison of fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we have used the grv , lo parametrisations for both the proton  @xcite and the photon  @xcite . we note here that at high energies , the rise with energy of the jet cross - sections is very similar in all the three cases , when difference between a photon and a proton is accounted for .",
    "a study of the @xmath22-dependence of the respective @xmath30 given by eqs .",
    "[ appgm ] ,  [ agmp ] , shows that the photon is much ` smaller ' as compared to the proton in the transverse space , which is also understandable as the photon after all owes its ` structure ' to the hard @xmath73 vertex .",
    "hence , we expect that the damping of the cross - section rise due to multiple scattering for photons will be less than for a proton .",
    "this , coupled with the above observation of the @xmath27 cross - section , implies that in the emm , total / inelastic cross - sections are expected to rise faster with energy as we replace a proton by a photon .",
    "i.e. , an increase in the pomeron intercept as we go from @xmath74 to  and as indicated by the data , is expected in the emm framework .",
    "now in this section let us spell out our strategy of fixing the various inputs to the emm .",
    "we restrict our analysis only to the photon - induced processes , i.e. ,  and  cross - section .",
    "we follow the same procedure as we had adopted in  @xcite , i.e. , we fix all the inputs to the emm by a fit to the data on the available photoproduction data on @xmath75 . here",
    "we do not include the data  @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , which has been obtained by an extrapolation of the low @xmath76 data to @xmath77 .",
    "we determine @xmath78 by a fit to the photoproduction data using a form suggested in  @xcite , @xmath79 we then determine @xmath80 and @xmath81 from the best fit to the low - energy photoproduction data , starting from the quark - model motivated ansatz @xmath82 . in earlier work",
    "@xcite we had used the inelastic formulation .",
    "now we have repeated the same exercise with the total cross - section formulation of the emm , which we believe is the more appropriate to use  @xcite .",
    "the results of our fit , using the total cross - section formulation of the emm , are shown    in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "the fit values of the parameters are @xmath83 as compared with the similar exercise done in  @xcite , we find that the rise of the eikonalised cross - sections with  is faster in this case than in the inelastic formulation .",
    "however , @xmath84 gev is still the best value to use , as seen from fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "we use here the form factor ansatz for the proton and the intrinsic @xmath46 ansatz for the photon with a value of parameter @xmath85 gev , which corresponds to the central value from the measurement  @xcite of the intrinsic @xmath46 distribution .",
    "we have used grv distributions for both the proton and photon and @xmath86 .",
    "we also find , similar to the analysis in the inelastic formulation by us  @xcite and others  @xcite , that the description of the photoproduction data in terms of a single eikonal leaves leeway for improvement .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the use of a single eikonal , so as to minimize our parameters but note that this can perhaps be cured by using an energy dependent or alternatively an energy dependent @xmath45 .",
    "now , having fixed all the inputs for the  case , we determine the corresponding parameters for the  case again by appealing to the quark model considerations and we use , ^soft _ = 23 ^soft_. all the other inputs are exactly the same as in the  case . in this manner , we have really _ extrapolated _ our results from  case to the  case .",
    "the results of our extrapolation are shown    in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] .",
    "notice that the overall normalization of the photonic cross - section depends upon @xmath87 .",
    "when extrapolating from photoproduction to photon - photon using the inelastic assumption , we had used @xmath88 , which can be thought of as corresponding to a 20% non - vmd component . using the total cross - section formulation ,",
    "the low energy production data suggest rather to use @xmath89 , a value which implies that the photon is practically purely a vector meson .",
    "then , fig.[figure4 ] shows that in the total cross - section formulation , the extrapolation from  to @xmath90 leads to cross - section which lies lower at low energies , but rises faster , than in the inelastic fits , for the same values of the parameters .    both the inelastic and the total cross - section",
    "are seen to rise faster than is expected in an universal pomeron picture .",
    "this feature is same both for  and  cases .",
    "we show the dependence of our results on the scale parameter @xmath45 .",
    "the band in the figure corresponds to using the regge - pomeron hypothesis of eq .",
    "[ regpom ] , measured values of @xmath91 for @xmath92 ,  case and the factorisation idea  @xcite @xmath93 here @xmath94 stand for an average for @xmath95 and @xmath74 case .",
    "we see that while our analysis using inelastic formulation and the default value of @xmath96 gev  @xcite gave predictions closer to the opal data the total cross - section formulation ,  _ for the same value of @xmath45 _ , gives results closer to the l3 data , as already pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the predictions to the difference between different parametrisations for the photonic partons increases with energy . at higher energies",
    "one is sensitive to the low-@xmath97 region about which not much is known .",
    "our earlier analysis  @xcite in the inelastic formulation had shown that the  cross - sections rise more slowly for the sas  @xcite parametrisation of the photonic parton densities .",
    "the dependence of our results in this analysis on the parton densities in the photon will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "[ figure5 ] shows a comparison of the eikonalised  and cross - sections , in the total formulation , with the different parameters for  and  case related as described before .",
    "we see indeed that in the emm the  cross - sections rise faster with  than  case , as was expected from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] and arguments following that .",
    "however , the dependence of this observation on  and/or the scale parameter needs to be still explored .",
    "in conclusion we discuss the results of an analysis of total and inelastic hadronic cross - sections for photon induced processes in the framework of an eikonalised minijet model ( emm ) .",
    "we have fixed various input parameters to the emm calculations by using the data on photoproduction cross - sections and then made predictions for  using _ same _ values of the parameters .",
    "we then compare our predictions with the recent measurements of  from lep .",
    "we find that the total cross - section formulation of the emm predicts faster rise with  as compared to the inelastic one , for the _ same _ value of @xmath28 and scale parameter @xmath45 . in the former case",
    "our extrapolations yield results closer to the l3 data whereas in the latter case they are closer to the opal results .",
    "we also find that in the framework of emm it is natural to expect a faster rise with  for the  case as compared to the  case .",

    "<S> in this talk i present the results of an analysis of total and inelastic hadronic cross - sections for photon induced processes in the framework of an eikonalised minijet model(emm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we fix the various input parameters to the emm calculations by using the data on photoproduction cross - sections and then make predictions for  using _ same _ values of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare our predictions with the recent measurements of  from lep . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that in the framework of the emm the rise with  of the total / inelastic cross - sections will be faster for photon induced processes than for the processes induced by hadrons like protons .    2gam    presented by the first author at the workshop on photon interactions and the photon structure , in lund , september 10 - 13 , 1998 .    2 </S>"
