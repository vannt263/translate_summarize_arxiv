    "more than 20 years have passed since the lee - weinberg bound on the stable heavy neutrino was proposed @xcite .",
    "it applies to an absolutely stable particle which needs a conserved quantum number .",
    "the decaying particle cosmology was propsed around the same time @xcite .",
    "but the decaying particle cosmology has been extensively applied for the gravitino @xcite . in this talk , we focus on the decay of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath1 to decay , the r - parity must be broken .    in supergravity",
    ", there can be nonrenormalizable interactions for the r - parity violation , but we neglect these compared to the renormalizable ones .",
    "there can be also r - violating bilinear terms , of the form @xmath2 , which can be rotated away at the superpotential level .",
    "however , in the presence of soft terms some bilinear terms can not be rotated away .",
    "but for decay processes , this subtle point is not important . thus we consider the r - violating trilinear terms , @xmath3 which are allowed by ( i ) supersymmetry and ( ii ) gauge symmetry .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to consider the phenomenology of r - parity violation . with the above superpotential present ,",
    "the lepton number and/or baryon number are broken .",
    "that is the reason for requiring the @xmath4 conservation .",
    "anyway , with the r - parity violation , we expect neutrino oscillation , proton decay , and other abnormal processes . from laboratory experiments ,",
    "the single bounds on the couplings are not very strong , e.g. @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "however , a combined bound from lower limit of the proton decay lifetime is very strong @xmath7 if a universal strength for the r - violating couplings are assumed , then these couplings are very small . for example , if a singlet scalar field @xmath8 carrying odd r - parity develops a vev , @xmath9 , then the r - parity is spontaneously broken . at low energy , these effects",
    "are represented by @xmath10 and @xmath11 couplings which carry negative r - parity .",
    "these may arise from nonrenormalizable interactions containing @xmath8 field . in this case , these couplings can be of the same order .    thus , to allow reasonably large r - violating couplings ,",
    "one usually fobid @xmath12 or @xmath11 completely .",
    "in general , laboratory experiments give upper bounds on the couplings .",
    "however , the cosmological bounds depend on the region of couplings .",
    "it is schematically shown in fig .",
    "1 . in this talk ,",
    "i am interested in the region @xmath13 s.",
    "the neutralino is a mixture of the neutral gauginos and neutral higgsinos , @xmath14 the decay can occur , for example , through @xmath15 where the virtual @xmath16 transforms to @xmath17 . for this process",
    ", the interaction is given by @xmath18 @xmath19for the @xmath20 decay , there exist 9 diagrams .",
    "the possible diagrams increase very rapidly if one considers colored final states .",
    "kinematically excluding @xmath21 final states , there are 1,080 diagrams .",
    "thus , we assume the _ universal sfermion mass _ to simplify the expression",
    ". then the @xmath1 decay rate is given by @xmath22 where the overall coefficient in front of the curly bracket is @xmath23 for @xmath24  tev and @xmath25  gev .",
    "the last moment when the heavy particles are in equilibrium with photons is the decoupling temperature @xmath27 . for the neutralino , it is determined by a competition between the universe expansion rate and @xmath1 destruction rate .",
    "the destruction rate is a function of sfermion mass for the @xmath28-channel process @xmath29 .",
    "if there exists a significant higgsino component , i.e. @xmath30 , then the @xmath31-channel @xmath32 exchange diagram dominates .",
    "it is the easiest way to estimate the decoupling temperature .",
    "however , we also include the sfermion exchange diagrams in the numerical estimation .",
    "nevertheless , the decoupling temperature does not depend on these parameters very much .",
    "let us introduce a decoupling factor @xmath33 @xmath34    the decoupling factor d is given for various parameter sets in ref .",
    "for example , @xmath35  gev , @xmath36  gev , @xmath37 , and the gaugino dominated neutralino ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ) give @xmath41 .",
    "for a wide range of parameters , @xmath33 is in the range 1530 .    in particular , we note the following .",
    "higgsino dominated @xmath1 gives a little bit smaller decoupling temperature and hence a lower @xmath1 density .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath42 channel processes are important for @xmath43 if @xmath44  gev .",
    "however , the decoupling temperature is rather insensitive to @xmath45 . in the numerical analyses",
    ", we further assumed the relations @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we note , however , that the cross section and the decoupling temperatures are not sensitive to these assumptions .    in the next section ,",
    "we are interested in relatively light neutralino case , which excludes the possibility of producing @xmath48 in the @xmath49 annihilation .",
    "if @xmath1 decays after 1 s , it affects the nucleosynthesis in a way of destructing the already manufactured light elements .",
    "note that our @xmath1 lifetime is @xmath50  s and the cosmic time scale in the radiation dominated era is @xmath51 .    requiring that @xmath52  ( energy of relativistic particles )",
    ", we obtain @xmath53  ( gev/@xmath54  s , which gives a @xmath55 bound of order @xmath56 .    a more stringent bound comes from the dissociation of light elements , in particular the d dissociation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 decay products degrade very rapidly by scattering with background photons .",
    "we are interested in the photons with @xmath57  mev .",
    "but @xmath58 production from scattering on the background radiation turned out to be important also @xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "another important temperature parameter @xmath59 is introduced . at @xmath59 ,",
    "the rates for the compton scattering and the @xmath58 production are comparable .",
    "the critical photon energy @xmath60 corresponding to @xmath59 is given by @xmath61(1/50 )  mev@xmath62 .",
    "then we note that @xmath63 ( with respect to the photon number ) photons with @xmath64 can be used to produce @xmath58 . in this case , the @xmath58 scatter off the background radiation to transfer the energy to photons which can dissociate @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , the maximum allowable lifetime @xmath66 is determined by the condition that if it decayed later than @xmath66 , the probability for photon to scatter with @xmath67 is negligible , namely it mostly scatter off with @xmath65 to dissociate it .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 must decay before @xmath66 .",
    "the equation for @xmath66 is @xmath68 where @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the photon energy in the fraction of @xmath1 mass , @xmath71 is the photon frequency , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are the deuteron dissociation cross section , klein - nishina cross section , and @xmath75 production cross section , respectively .",
    "the maximum scattered photon energy is @xmath76 .",
    "we calculated @xmath66 from the above formula to obtain @xmath77 for @xmath78 and 60  gev photino - like ( bino - like ) neutralino , the combination of r - violating couplings is bounded as @xmath79",
    "thus the sum of the r - violating couplings is bounded from below to a few times @xmath80 , the details of which depends on the nature of the neutralino . we studied the lifetime region around @xmath81  s in fig .  1 .",
    "of course , our bound is most meaningful if the r - violating couplings are of the same order .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is a allowed lifetime window between @xmath82  s and @xmath81  s.    j. e. kim , b. kyae and j. d. park , preprint hep - ph/9810503 .",
