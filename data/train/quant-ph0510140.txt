    "the wigner quasidistribution function on phase space @xmath4 @xcite , provides an important tool in the description of quantum systems from both theoretical and experimental point of view . of particular interest",
    "is for example , its application to the field of quantum tomography @xcite,@xcite .",
    "although the wigner function shares several properties with classical distribution functions on phase space it is not positive - definite . as a consequence ,",
    "the value of its integral , ( to be called alternatively quasiprobability integral(qpi ) , mass ( qpm ) , or volume ( qpv ) ) , over subregions of phase space , lies in general outside the interval @xmath5 $ ] , and may admit large positive or negative values .",
    "the upper and lower bounds of such integrals define tests e.g on the accuracy of experimental determinations of the wigner function in the sense that they give the degree to which the value of the integral lies outside @xmath5 $ ] , and thus their determination is of particular importance . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "it has been shown that such bounds , for given regions or contours of phase space for 1d quantum systems , are determined by the maximal and minimal eigenvalues of corresponding hermitian operators @xmath6 , called region operators ( ro ) , whose spectral analysis has been shown to have a rich algebraic structure .",
    "consequently the study of the properties of such operators defined by @xmath7 where @xmath1 is a subregion in phase space @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the characteristic function corresponding to @xmath1 and @xmath11 are the wigner operators , is of great importance .",
    "this article presents a detail analysis of transformation theory for ro , and in particularly investigates the cases of the point , line , rectangle and disk operators .",
    "the development of the theory is mainly based on the notion of completely positive trace increasing map ( cpti ) ( c.f @xcite ) , which provides the interconnection between various region operators .",
    "the application of such maps is also shown to describe tiling processes in phase space .",
    "moreover the eigenvalues of the obtained ros from step to step during the tiling are shown to respect majorization relations@xcite .",
    "this allows the determination of upper and lower bounds on qpi over regions in phase space obtained by a tiling process .",
    "an outline of the work is as follows : section two focuses on line and rectangle ros .",
    "the spectral analysis of straight line segment ros is presented and further it is shown that straight line ros are projection operators . on the other hand the normally ordered form of rectangle ros is obtained , and moreover it is shown that all rectangle ros obtained from an initial one by rigidly shifting its position in the phase plane , are isospectral and thus have the same quasiprobability volume .    in section three an operational construction of quasiprobability measures of canonical polygon ros is developed by introducing appropriate completely positive trace increasing ( cpti ) maps .",
    "an explicit example is then given in which a general canonical hexagon ro is constructed from the corresponding ro of an isosceles triangle , by means of cpti maps .",
    "finally in section four , appropriate cpti maps are used to realize a tiling process in phase space acting on rectangle and disk ros used as building blocks . the step matrix which connects the eigenvalue - vectors of ros at each step of the tiling process",
    "is shown to be simply determined by doubly stochastic matrices .",
    "this further allows to determine simple ordering relations between the eigenvalues of successive ros by means of the majorization theory .",
    "this fact provides intervals of extremal values for the eigenvalues i.e the qpm s , of the sequence of region operators , in a tiling process .",
    "section five briefly summarizes results and outlines some prospects of the theory of region operators .",
