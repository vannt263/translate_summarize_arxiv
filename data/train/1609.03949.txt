    ", however , it is unlikely that systems evolve according to the same identical dynamics along time . a more realistic mathematical framework to model",
    "the variability and errors that appear replication systems is to consider time - dependent ( non - autonomous ) iterations , in which the iterated map may change between steps ( evolve in time ) .",
    "random iterations have been studied since the early 1990 s , starting with the pioneering work of fornaess and sibony  @xcite . in the case of simply alternating two quadratic maps ,",
    "danca et al . have showed that the julia set can be disconnected without being totally disconnected  @xcite .",
    "they further related this extension to the fatou - julia theorem for complex polynomials of degree four , and showed that alternated julia sets exhibit graphical alternation .",
    "more recent work has been further addressing dynamic of the system and topological properties of the julia and mandelbrot set in the context of non - autonomous iterations  @xcite .    in previous work  @xcite",
    ", the authors have considered the iteration process of two different functions , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , according to a general binary symbolic sequence ( which we called a _ template _ ) , in which the zero positions correspond to iterating the function @xmath10 and the one positions correspond to iterating the function @xmath11 .",
    "we view template iterations as a more appropriate framework for replication or learning algorithms that appear in nature , with patterns that evolve in time , and which may involve occasional , random or periodic `` errors . ''",
    "while our results generally agree with existing results in non - autonomous iterations , our interest resides more specifically in understanding the dependence of the dynamic behavior on the two primary features of this system s hardwiring : ( 1 ) the complex parameter pair @xmath12 that fixes the iterated maps and ( 2 ) the structure of the template , i.e. the particular succession ( timing ) of the 0s and 1s that govern the iteration order .",
    "we will be working within the complex quadratic family @xmath13    for fixed parameters @xmath14 , and a fixed binary sequence @xmath15 , one can define the template orbit for any @xmath16 as the sequence @xmath17 constructed recursively , for every @xmath18 , as : @xmath19    in previous work , we considered the extension of the traditional mandelbrot set for a symbolic template system .",
    "since , in order to construct a template julia set , we need both a complex parameter pair @xmath12 and a symbolic template , we can consider objects in two different parameter spaces : in @xmath20 ( for a fixed template @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( for a fixed pair @xmath12 ) .",
    "we defined two main types of `` mandelbrot '' sets , as follows :    fix @xmath23 a symbolic sequence .",

    "the main goal of this paper is to visualize and study the structure of these sets , in particular understand their dependence on the complex parameters and on the template structure , whichever appropriate in each case .",

    "in this paper , we expanded our investigations of the asymptotic dynamics of template iterations with new concepts and results . after introducing the _ fixed template mandelbrot _",
    "@xcite in our previous work , in the current paper we concentrated on fixing the complex parameter pair @xmath12 , and understanding the topology of the _ fixed - map _ mandelbrot set as a subset of the template space @xmath252 .",
    "we then defined _ hybrid _ sets which , for a fixed @xmath62 classify the values of @xmath69 based on how likely it is for a random template to produce a bounded critical orbit @xmath28 .",
    "the hybrid sets we define have a less complex geometric structure than the traditional mandelbrot set ( they do not have fractal behavior ) .",
    "this is not too surprising : the phenomenon of cooperation between generating maps has been already proposed by sumi  @xcite as a contributor to decreasing the chaos in the overall system .",
    "however , this phenomenon was only described in the context of averaged behavior over all initial conditions . our numerical result seems to support a similar effect of randomness `` smoothing out the chaotic structure '' along the boundary of the mandelbrot set .",
    "a better understanding of the latter , as well as a possible relationship between these two phenomena may become clearer with a more rigorous investigation of the topology of template mandelbrot slices .",
    "our line of study includes understanding and interpreting the importance of this type of results in the context of models from natural sciences .",
    "one potential view , proposed by the authors in their previous joint work , is to interpret iterated orbits as describing the temporal evolution of an evolving system ( e.g. , copying and proofreading dna sequences , or updating steps in a learning algorithm ) . along these lines ,",
    "an initial condition which escapes to @xmath109 under iterations may represent a feature of the system which becomes in time unsustainable , while an initial condition which is attracted to a simple periodic orbit may represent a feature which is too simple to be relevant or efficient for the system .",
    "then the points on the boundary between these two behaviors ( i.e. , the julia set ) may be viewed as the set of optimal features , allowing the system to operate in a dynamic regime ideal for performing its complex function .",
    "one can study how the `` sustainable set of features '' changes when introducing occasional or periodic errors into the iteration process .",
    "for example , one may be interested to understand for what types of errors the julia set is disconnected , since that will indicate that the system may exhibit optimal function starting from more than one connected locus of initial conditions . in the traditional theory ( due to the fatou - julia theorem ) the critical point @xmath253 is an important reference point , since the behavior of its orbit is indicative of the respective julia set topology ( if @xmath253 is in the julia set , then the julia set is connected ) .    in our current work , we study the asymptotic behavior of the critical point when an `` erroneous '' function @xmath11 interferes into the iteration of a correct function @xmath10 .",
    "one natural question to ask in this context is how far can the erroneous map @xmath69 stray from the given correct map @xmath62 , so that we can be sure ( with some probability @xmath254 ) what the critical orbit @xmath28 stays bounded when a random template @xmath21 prescribes where the errors will hit in the iteration process . to address and",
    "illustrate this question , and to obtain our first analytic insights into the answer , we defined and studied hybrid mandelbrot sets .",
    "this study only a step in establishing significant questions that can be addressed , in understanding their connection ( similarities and differences ) to the classical theory of single map iterations , and in exploring potential applications .",
    "a lot of theoretical work remains to be done , possibly exploring a brand new set of questions in discrete dynamics , requiring new methods from non - autonomous iterations , and the corresponding extensions for the concepts of critical and periodic orbits ."
