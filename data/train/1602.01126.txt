    "the _ @xmath0-catalan numbers _ were introduced in 1996 by garsia and haiman as part of an ongoing study of macdonald s symmetric polynomials and the representation theory of the diagonal harmonics modules  @xcite .",
    "garsia and haiman s original definition has the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the set of integer partitions of @xmath6 , and @xmath11 is a complicated rational function in @xmath2 and @xmath3 built up from the arms , legs , coarms , and colegs of the cells in the ferrers diagram of @xmath12 .",
    "( these terms will be defined below ; for general background on partitions and symmetric functions , we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "see haglund s",
    "book  @xcite for an extensive discussion of @xmath0-catalan numbers . )",
    "let @xmath13 be the conjugate of the partition @xmath12 , whose diagram is obtained by transposing the diagram of @xmath12 .",
    "it follows from the definition of the rational functions @xmath11 that @xmath14 . replacing the summation index @xmath12 by @xmath13 in",
    ", we deduce the _ joint symmetry property _",
    "another much less obvious property of the original @xmath0-catalan numbers is that each @xmath1 is a _ polynomial _ in @xmath2 and @xmath3 with _ nonnegative integer",
    "_ coefficients .",
    "garsia and haiman were able to prove that the specialization @xmath16 was a polynomial obtained by summing terms @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a _ dyck path of order @xmath6 _ and @xmath19 is the number of area cells below the path .",
    "( see below for more detailed definitions . )",
    "this suggested that there might be a second statistic @xmath20 on dyck paths , such that @xmath21 .",
    "one such statistic , called the _ bounce statistic _ , was conjectured by haglund in 2003  @xcite . upon hearing from garsia",
    "that haglund had found a statistic , haiman quickly discovered another statistic called _ dinv _ that also appeared to work .",
    "the two conjectures were found to be equivalent via a bijection on dyck paths that sends the pair of statistics @xmath22 to the pair of statistics @xmath23 . in particular , this implies that all three statistics have the same distribution on dyck paths of order @xmath6 .",
    "garsia and haglund were eventually able to prove that haglund s combinatorial formula for @xmath1 was indeed correct .",
    "their proof ( announced in  @xcite and given in detail in  @xcite ) consists of extremely intricate algebraic manipulations of symmetric polynomials , making extensive use of plethystic calculus .",
    "since the original @xmath0-catalan numbers are jointly symmetric in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the same must be true of the various combinatorial formulas for @xmath0-catalan numbers .",
    "in particular , there must exist a bijection on dyck paths of order @xmath6 interchanging the area and bounce statistics , and there must exist another bijection interchanging area and dinv .",
    "however , at this time , no one has been able to construct such bijections valid for all @xmath6 .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate the joint symmetry of @xmath0-catalan numbers from a combinatorial viewpoint . roughly speaking , we prove combinatorially that the homogeneous components of @xmath1 of sufficiently high degree have the desired joint symmetry property , and we formulate several conjectures that provide a general framework for understanding joint symmetry .      to state our results more precisely",
    ", we must first review the details of the combinatorial definition of @xmath0-catalan numbers based on the area and dinv statistics .",
    "the definition can be formulated in three equivalent ways , using combinatorial objects called _ dyck vectors _ , _ dyck paths _ , or _",
    "dyck partitions _ , which are all illustrated in figure",
    "[ fig : object ] below .",
    "the simplest formulation involves dyck vectors ( also called _ dyck sequences _ or the _ area vectors of dyck paths _ ) , so we discuss these first .    a _ dyck vector _ is a finite sequence @xmath24 such that @xmath25 , every @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for all @xmath28 .",
    "the _ area _ of a dyck vector is @xmath29 .",
    "the _ diagonal inversion count _ of a dyck vector , denoted @xmath30 , is the number of @xmath31 such that @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the set of all dyck vectors of length @xmath6 .",
    "finally , define the _",
    "combinatorial @xmath0-catalan numbers _ by setting @xmath34    the vector @xmath35 is a dyck vector in @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the entries in the vector @xmath39 count the number of shaded cells in each row of figure  [ fig : object ] below , reading from the bottom of the figure to the top .",
    "these cells lie underneath a _",
    "dyck path _",
    ", which is a lattice path from @xmath40 to @xmath41 consisting of north and east steps that never go below the line @xmath42 .",
    "this correspondence between dyck vectors and dyck paths is a bijection .",
    "so we sometimes identify these two types of objects , blurring the distinction between a dyck vector ( a list of integers ) and the associated dyck path ( a sequence of north and east steps ) .    when @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 , so @xmath45    for larger values of @xmath6 , it is convenient to display the coefficients of @xmath46 in a matrix , where the entry @xmath47 rows to the right and @xmath48 columns above the lower - left corner is the coefficient of @xmath49 in @xmath46 .",
    "for instance , @xmath50 is represented by the matrix @xmath51,\\ ] ] where zeroes are denoted by dots for visual clarity .    to prove joint symmetry of @xmath46 , it is sufficient to show that each diagonal of the coefficient matrix has the joint symmetry property .",
    "for instance , it is not too hard to show ( see lemma  [ lem : c0-opp ] below ) that the main ( highest ) diagonal consists of @xmath52 s running southeast from position @xmath53 to position @xmath54 . in general",
    ", the combinatorial complexity increases as we move southwest from this main diagonal ( in a sense made more precise later ) .",
    "the next definition introduces a statistic that keeps track of which diagonal each object belongs to .    for a dyck vector @xmath55 ,",
    "define the _ deficit of @xmath39 _ to be @xmath56 ( we will see below that @xmath57 . ) let @xmath58 . for all @xmath59 , define the _",
    "@xmath0-catalan numbers of order @xmath6 and level @xmath60 _ by @xmath61    the dyck vector @xmath35 has @xmath62 .",

    "our first main result is a combinatorial proof of the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : jsym - levelk ] for all @xmath66 and all @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "this result will emerge from a framework of ( partially proved ) conjectures regarding the combinatorial structure of the sets @xmath69 . to state these conjectures",
    ", we must first describe an alternate formulation of the @xmath0-catalan numbers phrased in terms of dyck partitions .",
    "an _ integer partition _ is a sequence @xmath70 of weakly decreasing nonnegative integers .",
    "we set @xmath71 and let @xmath72 be the number of nonzero entries in @xmath12 .",
    "we identify sequences that differ only in the number of trailing zeroes ; for example , @xmath73 and @xmath74 and @xmath75 all represent the same partition .",
    "let @xmath10 be the set of partitions @xmath12 with @xmath76 , and let @xmath77 be the set of all integer partitions .",
    "formally , the _ diagram _ of a partition @xmath12 is the set @xmath78 the _ conjugate _ of @xmath12 is the partition @xmath13 with diagram @xmath79 .",
    "we usually visualize @xmath80 as an array of left - justified unit boxes , with @xmath81 boxes in the @xmath47th row from the top .",
    "for example , the diagram of the partition @xmath82 appears northwest of the dyck path in figure  [ fig : object ] .",
    "that figure suggests a correspondence between dyck paths of order @xmath6 and integer partitions contained in a staircase shape .",
    "this is formalized in the next definition .",
    "for each @xmath66 , let @xmath83 be the partition @xmath84 .",
    "we call @xmath85 a _ dyck partition of order @xmath6 _ iff @xmath86 , which means that @xmath87 and @xmath88 for all @xmath89 .",
    "let @xmath90 be the set of dyck partitions of order @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath85 , let @xmath91 be the minimum @xmath6 such that @xmath92 .",
    "the set of all integer partitions is the increasing union of the sets @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath93 we obtain a bijection from @xmath90 to the set of dyck paths of order @xmath6 by mapping @xmath92 to the frontier of @xmath94 when we embed the diagram of @xmath95 in the diagram of @xmath83 .",
    "we can then transform this dyck path into a dyck vector by counting area cells to the right of the path in each row .",
    "it is routine to establish the following formulas for bijections @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which will be needed later : @xmath98 in the second formula , we pad @xmath95 with zero parts so that @xmath95 has exactly @xmath6 nonnegative parts .",
    "next we define area and dinv statistics for dyck partitions .",
    "first we review the notions of arm , leg , coarm , and coleg for cells in a partition diagram .    given @xmath85 and a cell @xmath99 , the _ arm _ of @xmath100 is @xmath101 , which is the number of boxes strictly right of @xmath100 in its row of the diagram .",

    "@xmath129 we have @xmath130 ; note that @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "one may check that for all @xmath133 , @xmath134 it suffices to verify that the bijection @xmath135 sends the statistics @xmath136 on dyck vectors to the corresponding statistics @xmath137 on dyck partitions .",
    "this certainly holds for the area statistics , and it is not too hard to prove for the dinv statistics ( for details , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.4.1 and 6.3.3 ) ) .",
    "it then follows that the deficit statistic is also preserved , which also establishes the earlier claim that the deficit of a dyck vector is always nonnegative .",
    "one advantage of using dyck partitions is that the dinv and deficit of a partition @xmath92 do not change when @xmath6 is increased , and the area changes in a predictable way : @xmath138 .",
