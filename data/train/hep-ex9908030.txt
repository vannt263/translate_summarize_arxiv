    "the hadronic structure in the decays @xmath37 and @xmath38 has been the focus of several studies in recent years  @xcite . in most of these studies ,",
    "models are employed to characterize the hadronic structure .",
    "as data samples have grown , revealing new and complex features , the models used have also become more complicated .",
    "for example , simple models assume the @xmath39 mass spectrum in these decays can be described by a single resonance , the @xmath40 meson .",
    "delphi @xcite found it necessary to include a radially excited @xmath41 meson , the @xmath42 meson .",
    "subsequently , cleo @xcite , obtained a slightly improved description when including an @xmath43 meson , but found that the most significant improvement came about from accounting for a threshold effect in the mass - dependence of the @xmath41 width due to the opening of the @xmath44 decay channel .",
    "similarly , models attributing structure in the @xmath39 dalitz plot distributions solely to decay amplitudes associated with @xmath45 were found to be insufficient by argus @xcite and cleo @xcite , who see indications of isospin zero contributions , from @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath49 ) meson production .",
    "the models used are not unique , as significant variations in their form and content can lead to similar features in the distributions of observable quantities . in addition , no model has so far given a fully satisfactory description of the data .",
    "thus , although the studies done so far have improved our knowledge , we still do not have a clear picture of the hadronic dynamics in @xmath3 decay to neutrino plus three pions .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to compare results from different experiments and draw additional conclusions since each analysis can only be interpreted in the context of the specific model(s ) considered .",
    "j.  h.  khn and e.  mirkes @xcite have constructed a convenient approach for model independent studies through the determination of structure functions . in this approach ,",
    "the kinematics of the three pions are studied in a particular reference frame . in this frame",
    ", contributions from the production of @xmath39 systems with different spin - parity quantum numbers are separated into different structure functions , expressed in a completely model independent fashion .",
    "this approach also has the advantage that the features in the data are condensed into a compact form which can be used to test models , alone or in conjunction with data from other experiments .",
    "so far , only opal @xcite has determined the structure functions , using the decay @xmath50 .",
    "they obtained the first fully model independent measurement of the signed @xmath3 neutrino helicity as well as a model independent limit on non - axial - vector contributions .    here , we present a measurement of the structure functions in the decay @xmath51 , based on data collected with the cleo  ii detector corresponding to @xmath2 produced @xmath3-pair events .",
    "the sample of selected events is essentially the same as the one used in our model dependent analysis .",
    "consequently , we refer the reader to the article reporting on that work  @xcite for details common to both analyses .",
    "the outline for the rest of the article is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the structure function formalism of khn and mirkes  @xcite as applied to this decay mode . in section  [ s - evtsel ]",
    ", we describe the cleo  ii detector and the event selection criteria .",
    "the method used to determine the structure functions is discussed in section  [ s - method ] , and the results are presented in section  [ s - measure ] . the derived limits on non - axial - vector contributions are given in section  [ s - nonaxial ] . in section  [ s - sys ]",

    "a summary and discussion of the results follows in section  [ s - summ ] .",
