    "determining the evolutionary distances between two protein sequences requires the knowledge of the substitution rates of amino - acids .",
    "it is generally accepted that the more substitutions are necessary to change one sequence into another , the more unrelated they are and the larger their distance to the common ancestor .",
    "the most widely used method for the calculation of distances between sequences is based on the mutation data matrix , @xmath4 , published by dayhoff et al .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath5 represent amino acids , and an element @xmath4 of the matrix gives the probability that the amino acid in column @xmath6 will be replaced by the amino acid in row @xmath7 after a given evolutionary time interval",
    ". the interval corresponding to @xmath0 percent of substitutions between two compared sequences is called one pam ( percent of accepted mutations ) , and the corresponding matrix is denoted as pam@xmath0 matrix .",
    "there is assumed a markov model of sequence evolution and a simple power @xmath8 of the pam@xmath0 matrix ( multiplied by itself @xmath2 times ) denotes a matrix , pam@xmath2 , that gives the amino acid substitution probability after @xmath2 pams .",
    "today , a much more accurate pam matrix is available , generated from 16130 protein sequences , published by jones et al . @xcite .",
    "the large number of compared genes guarantees that the matrix has negligible statistical errors and it can be considered to be the reference matrix during the calculations of the phylogenetic distances .",
    "the matrix is also known as pet@xmath1 matrix .",
    "recently , by comparing intergenic sequences being remnants of coding sequences with homologous sequences of genes , we have constructed an empirical table of the nucleotide substitution rates in the case of the leading dna strand of the _ b. burgdorferi _ genome @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "we have found that substitution rates , which determine the evolutionary turnover time of a given kind of nucleotide in third codon positions of coding sequences , are highly correlated with the frequency of the occurrence of that nucleotide in the sequences .",
    "there is a compositional bias produced by replication process , introducing long - range correlation among nucleotides in the third positions in codons , which is very similar to the bias seen in the intergenic sequences @xcite .",
    "we have used the empirical table of nucleotide substitution rates to simulate mutational pressure on the genes lying on the leading dna strand of the _ b.burgdorferi _ genome and we have constructed mpm@xmath0 matrix ( mutation probability matrix ) for amino acid substitutions in the evolving genes .",
    "thus the resulting table represents the percent of amino acid substitutions introduced by mutational pressure and not by selection .",
    "next , we compared the survival times of the amino acids in the case without any selection with the effective survival times of the amino acids , counted with the help of the pam1 pet91 matrix .",
    "dna sequence of the _ b.burgdorferi _",
    "genome was downloaded from the website + _ www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov_. the empirical mutation table for nucleotides in third positions in codons , which we used in the paper , is the following @xcite,@xcite :    @xmath9    where @xmath10    and the elements of the matrix give the probability that nucleotide in column @xmath6 will mutate to the nucleotide in row @xmath7 during one replication cycle .",
    "the symbols @xmath11 represent relative substitution probability of nucleotide @xmath6 by nucleotide @xmath7 , and @xmath12 represents mutation rate .",
    "the symbols @xmath13 in the diagonal represent relative substitution probability of nucleotide @xmath6 :    @xmath14    and @xmath15 .",
    "the expression for the mean survival time of the nucleotide @xmath6 depends on @xmath16 as follows ( derivation can be found in @xcite )    @xmath17    the above approximated formula is true for small values of the mutation rate @xmath12 .    in papers @xcite,@xcite,@xcite",
    ", we concluded that in a natural genome the frequency of occurrence @xmath18 of the nucleotides , in the third position in codons , is linearly related to the respective mean survival time @xmath19 ,    @xmath20    with the same coefficients , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , for each nucleotide .",
    "the kimura s neutral theory @xcite of evolution assumes the constancy of the evolution rate , where the mutations are random events , much the same as the random decay events of the radioactive decay .",
    "however , the linear law in ( [ r_lin ] ) is not contrary to the kimura s theory .",
    "still , the mutations represent random decay events but they are correlated with the dna composition .",
    "we used computer random number generator to generate random deviates with a distribution defined by the elements of the mutation matrix in ( [ macierz1 ] ) . with",
    "the help of the random deviates we were mutating nucleotide sequences of 564 genes from the leading dna strand of the _ b. burdorferi _ genome .",
    "the applied value of the mutation pressure was @xmath23 .    for each gene ,",
    "considered to be an ancestral one in this simulated evolution , we prepared @xmath24 pairs of homologous sequences , which diverged from this gene .",
    "the gene evolution was stopped when the number of substitutions between the homologous protein sequences reached 1% .",
    "all the sequences were translated into amino acids and we constructed a mutation probability matrix mpm@xmath0 according to the procedure of dayhoff et al.@xcite and jones et al . @xcite .",
    "the resulting mutation table , with substitution probabilities @xmath4 , the amino acid mutability @xmath25 , and the fraction @xmath18 of amino - acid in the compared sequences have been presented , respectively , in table [ table2 ] and table [ mutability ] .",
    "the elements @xmath4 of the mpm@xmath0 matrix in table [ table2 ] have been scaled with the parameter @xmath26 , which related them to the evolutionary distance of one percent of substitutions and it is equal to 0.00009731 in our simulations .",
    "we introduced the parameter @xmath26 following the equation ( 3 ) in the paper by jones et al.@xcite ) .",
    "therefore ,    .mutation probability matrix for an evolutionary distance of 1 pam ( splitted into two parts ) .",
    "values of the matrix elements are scaled by a factor of @xmath24 and rounded to an integer .",
    "the symbols in the first row and the first column represent amino - acids and numbers following colons -number of codons representing a given amino - acid in the universal genetic code . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the major qualitative difference between the mpm matrix introduced in the previous section and the pam1 pet91 matrix published in the paper by jones et al.@xcite is that the first one is a result of pure mutational pressure whereas the second one is a result of both mutational and selection pressures .",
    "thus , we have two evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the resulting pam matrices .    with the help of formula ( [ r_approx ] ) ( extended to amino acids ) we have calculated effective survival times of amino acids in the case of the mpm@xmath0 matrix ( table [ table2 ] ) and the mutational / selectional pam@xmath0 pet@xmath1 matrix ( @xcite ) .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath26 is a counterpart of @xmath12 in ( [ r_approx ] ) . in fig.[fig1 ] , we presented the relation between the calculated survival time o amino acids and their fractions in the _ b. burgdorferi _ proteins , in the pairs of diverged genes , in a log - log scale .",
    "one can observe that the data are highly correlated and in both cases the dependence of the mean survival time of amino acid on the fraction of the amino acid represents a power law :    @xmath27    with a negative value of @xmath28 in the case of selection and a positive value of @xmath29 in the case of mutation pressure on the leading dna strand of the _ b. burgdorferi _ genome .",
    "the value of @xmath30 for the analogous mutational pam1 matrix calculated in the case of the lagging dna strand of the _ b. burgdorferi _",
    "genome is about twice as small .",
    "it is worth to underline that the slopes @xmath30 are the same for the matrices pam@xmath2 with high values of @xmath2 , and thus , they are universal with respect to evolution .",
    "( 100,210)(-50,30.0 ) = 9.5 cm    ( 100,190)(5,0.0 ) = 8.6 cm    ( 100,190)(-10,0.0 ) = 7.6 cm    in fig.[fig1 ] we may observe a kind of evolutional scissors acting on amino acids . once the less frequent amino acids , like @xmath31 ( tryptophane ) , @xmath32 ( cysteine ) , have much shorter turn over time compared with other amino acids ( as can be seen from the lower line ) the selection pressure ( upper line ) counteracts with the effect . on the other hand , the most mutable amino acids , like @xmath33 ( leucine ) or @xmath34 ( isoleucine ) , which are very frequent in genes , seem to be much weakly influenced by selection .    in genes",
    "the fraction of the amino acids most protected by selection strongly depends on gene size , it is diminishing when gene s size is increasing .",
    "the effect weakens if we go into right the direction of the evolutionary scissors in fig.[fig1 ] .    to show this , we ordered all 564 genes under consideration with respect to fraction of an examined amino acid and the genes have been assigned a rank number .",
    "next , we plotted the dependence of both the gene size on the rank and the dependence of the amino acid fraction in the gene on the rank .",
    "the resulting plots in figs.[fig2 ] correspond to two evolutionary extreme cases , representing tryptophan and leucine .",
    "it is evident that in the case of tryptophan the fraction of that amino acid in genes is anti - correlated with the gene s size ( notice , that about @xmath35 genes do not posses tryptophan ) . in the case of leucine",
    "there is a crossover and the effect of selection is evident only for the genes which have more than 10% of that amino acid . when the fraction of leucine is less than 10% there is even a reverse effect , i.e. , the increasing fraction is correlated with the increasing gene s size .",
    "if we look at the evolutionary scissors in fig.[fig1 ] , we can see that in the case of leucine the survival time , which originates from pure mutational pressure is longer than its selectional counterpart .",
    "recently , there has appeared a paper by xia and li @xcite discussing which amino acid properties ( like polarity , isoelectric point , volume etc . )",
    "affect protein evolution .",
    "thus , there is a possibility to relate these properties to our discussion of the evolutionary scissors .",
    "we have shown that the amino acids which experience the highest selectional pressure have the shortest turn over time with respect to mutation pressure .",
    "the fraction of these amino acids in genes depends on the gene s size .",
    "much different is the selectional role of the amino acids , like leucine , from the right hand side of the selectional scissors .",
    "although they have long turn over time with respect to the mutational pressure , their fraction can not be too high .",
    "this could be considered as an effect of optimisation of the genetic information on coding with processes of mutagenesis and phenotype selection for protein functions .",
