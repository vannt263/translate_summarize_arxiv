    "we have compared the observed outburst decay with the more physical theoretical model presented in pons & rea ( 2012 ) .",
    "in addition , we have performed numerical simulations with a 2d code designed to model the magneto - thermal evolution of neutron stars . in figure 1 ( left ) ,",
    "super - imposed , we show our best representative model that reproduce the observed properties of the decay of outburst .",
    "this model corresponds to an injection of @xmath9  erg  @xmath10 in the outer crust , in the narrow layer with density between @xmath11 and @xmath12 g  @xmath10 , and in an angular region of 35 degrees ( 0.6 rad ) around the pole .",
    "the total injected energy was then @xmath13  erg .",
    "for the x - ray timing analysis we used all available data after barycentering all the events . we started by obtaining an accurate period measurement by folding the data from the first two xrt pointings which were separated by less than 1day , and studying the phase evolution within these observations by means of a phase - fitting technique ( see ( * ? ? ? * dallosso et  al .",
    "2003 ) for details ) .",

    "the above period accuracy of 20@xmath17s is enough to phase - connect coherently the later _ swift _ , _ rxte _ , _ chandra _ , _ suzaku _ , and _ xmm  newton _ pointings ( see figure[fig : phases ] ) .",
    "we modeled the phase evolution with a linear plus quadratic term .",
    "the corresponding coherent solution ( valid until november 2011 ) is @xmath18s and period derivative @xmath19s s@xmath20 ( @xmath21 for 57 dof ; at epoch mjd 55757.0 ) .",
    "the above solution accuracy allows us to unambiguously extrapolate the phase evolution until the beginning of the next _ swift _  visibility window which started in february 2012 .",
    "the final resulting phase - coherent solution , once the latest 2012 observations are included , returns a best - fit period of @xmath0s and period derivative of @xmath22s  s@xmath20 at mjd 55757.0 ( @xmath23 for 67 dof ) .",
    "the above best - fit values imply a surface dipolar magnetic field of @xmath2 g ( at the equator ) , a characteristic age of @xmath24myr , and a spin - down power l@xmath25 ( assuming a neutron star radius of 10 km and a mass of 1.4@xmath26 ) .",
    "the final solution has a relatively high r.m.s .",

    "we have reported on the outburst evolution of the new magnetar , which , despite its relatively low magnetic field ( @xmath30 g ) , is in line with the outbursts observed for other magnetars with higher dipolar magnetic fields .",
    "we found that the current properties of the source can be reproduced if it has now an age of @xmath31kyr , and it was born with a toroidal crustal field of @xmath32 g , which has by now decayed by less than an order of magnitude .",

    "( 2012 ) , we note that the discovery of a second magnetar - like source with a magnetic field in the radio - pulsar range strengthens the idea that magnetar - like behavior may be much more widespread than what believed in the past , and that it is related to the intensity and topology of the internal and surface toroidal components , rather than only to the surface dipolar field ( ( * ? ? ?",
