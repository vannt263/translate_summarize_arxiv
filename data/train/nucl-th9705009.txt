    "a major goal in nuclear physics is to understand how nuclear binding , stability , and structure arise from the underlying interactions between individual nucleons .",
    "a large amount of empirical information about the nucleon - nucleon scattering problem has been accumulated over time , resulting in ever more sophisticated @xmath4 potential models . however , for many years , it has been feasible to calculate exactly only three- and four - body nuclei with realistic @xmath4 interactions .",
    "thanks to the ongoing advances in computational resources , particularly the advent of massively parallel computers , it is now possible to apply sophisticated quantum monte carlo methods to the study of light @xmath5-shell nuclei , which have a far richer spectrum to investigate .    the @xmath5-shell has long been a testing ground for shell model methods  @xcite .",
    "shell - model studies of @xmath6 nuclei have recently progressed to the stage of large - basis , `` no - core '' calculations using @xmath7-matrices derived from the latest @xmath4-interaction models  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , there have been extensive studies of these light nuclei with cluster - cluster models , using combinations of @xmath4 and @xmath8 potentials  @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to calculate properties , in particular ground - state energies , of the light @xmath5-shell nuclei directly from bare @xmath4 and @xmath9 interactions , without any intermediate effective interaction .",
    "recently we reported  @xcite first results for the ground states of @xmath2he , @xmath2li , and @xmath2be , and the first two excited states in @xmath2li , calculated with the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method for a hamiltonian containing the argonne @xmath1 @xmath4 and urbana ix @xmath9 potentials . here",
    "we present improved and extended calculations for the @xmath10 nuclei and the first detailed studies of @xmath3he , @xmath3li , @xmath3be , and @xmath3b , including all the observed low - lying excitations . in this work ,",
    "it is possible to see for the first time the full splendor of the nuclear shell structure emanating directly from a microscopic interaction that fits @xmath4 scattering data .",
    "the argonne @xmath1 model  @xcite is one of a class of new , highly accurate @xmath4 potentials that fit both @xmath11 and @xmath12 scattering data up to 350 mev with a @xmath13datum near 1 .",
    "this necessarily involves the introduction of charge - independence breaking in the strong force ; a complete electromagnetic interaction is also included as an integral part of the model .",
    "this makes the model useful for studying charge dependence and charge - symmetry breaking in nuclei .",
    "the @xmath4 potential is supplemented by a three - nucleon interaction from the urbana series of @xmath9 potentials  @xcite , including both long - range two - pion exchange and a short - range phenomenological component .",
    "the urbana model ix is adjusted to reproduce the binding energy of @xmath14h and give a reasonable saturation density in nuclear matter when used with argonne @xmath1 .",
    "details of the hamiltonian are given in sec.ii .",
    "the first step in our calculation is the construction of suitable trial functions .",
    "variational wave functions based on products of correlated operators have been used successfully for @xmath14h and @xmath15he , giving binding energies about 2% above exact faddeev , hyperspherical harmonic , or gfmc solutions  @xcite .",
    "we generalize this type of trial function for @xmath16 nuclei , adding @xmath5-wave orbitals and using @xmath17 coupling to produce all possible @xmath18 quantum states .",
    "parameters in the trial functions are adjusted to minimize the energy expectation value , evaluated with monte carlo integration , subject to the constraint that rms radii are close to the experimental values for @xmath2li and @xmath3li .",
    "unfortunately , the best trial functions we have been able to build do not give @xmath5-shell nuclei stable against breakup into subclusters .",
    "nevertheless , these trial functions provide a good starting point for the gfmc calculation .",
    "the variational wave functions and a brief description of the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculations are given in sec.iii .",
    "the gfmc method projects out the exact lowest energy state , @xmath19 , for a given set of quantum numbers , from a suitable trial function , @xmath20 , using @xmath21 \\psi_t$ ] .",
    "the method has been used with great success in a variety of condensed matter problems , and in @xmath22-shell nuclei with realistic interactions  @xcite .",
    "our first calculations for @xmath5-shell nuclei  @xcite were made with a short time approximation for the propagation in imaginary time , carried out to @xmath23 mev@xmath24 and extrapolated to @xmath25 . in the present work",
    "we have improved the algorithm by adopting an exact two - body propagator which allows bigger time steps , saving significantly on the computational cost .",
    "we also have started our calculations with better trial functions , which allows more reliable results to be obtained from gfmc propagations that are limited to small @xmath26 .",
    "a detailed discussion of the method as applied to realistic nuclear forces is given in sec.iv .",
    "the vmc and gfmc calculations for @xmath5-shell nuclei are very computer intensive , and would not have been possible without the recent advances in computational power due to the advent of massively parallel machines .",
    "section v describes the implementation of the gfmc algorithm in a parallel environment , including issues of communication between processors and load - balancing .",
    "we have also performed a number of tests of the gfmc method , including comparisons to other exact calculations for @xmath22-shell nuclei , studies of extrapolation in @xmath26 , and sensitivity to the quality of the input trial function .",
    "these tests are described in sec.vi .",
    "results of our gfmc calculations are presented in sec.vii .",
    "we have obtained energies for five states of unique @xmath18 in the @xmath10 nuclei , and another five states in @xmath27 nuclei , not counting isobaric analog states .",
    "in general we find the nuclei are slightly underbound with the present hamiltonian , but @xmath2li ( @xmath3li ) is stable against breakup into @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) . the low - lying excited states are correctly ordered with reasonable excitation energies .",
    "the vmc energies are found to lie @xmath30 ( 4.5 ) mev above the gfmc results in @xmath10 ( 7 ) nuclei , but with very similar excitation energies .",
    "we have also used the vmc wave functions to perform small - basis diagonalizations of states with the same quantum numbers but different symmetries .",
    "these calculations optimize the admixtures of different - symmetry contributions to the ground state , and also provide estimates for higher - lying excited states with the same @xmath18 quantum numbers .",
    "we verify that these states , not all of which have been observed , do indeed lie at moderately higher excitations .",
    "the vmc spectra are also discussed in sec.vii .",
    "one- and two - body density distributions from both vmc and gfmc calculations are presented in sec.viii .",
    "these include the densities of spin up / down nucleons in polarized @xmath2li and @xmath3li . in general ,",
    "the gfmc densities are slightly more peaked than the input vmc densities , but overall they are very similar . unfortunately ,",
    "both vmc and gfmc calculations are not very sensitive to the very long range properties of the wave functions .",
    "therefore it is not yet possible to accurately calculate the quadrupole moments and asymptotic @xmath31 ratios with these methods .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in sec.ix .",
    "our hamiltonian includes a nonrelativistic one - body kinetic energy , the argonne @xmath1 two - nucleon potential @xcite and the urbana ix three - nucleon potential @xcite , @xmath32 the kinetic energy operator has charge - independent ( ci ) and charge - symmetry - breaking ( csb ) components , the latter due to the difference in proton and neutron masses , @xmath33    the argonne @xmath1 potential can be written as a sum of electromagnetic and one - pion - exchange terms and a shorter - range phenomenological part , @xmath34 the electromagnetic terms include one- and two - photon - exchange coulomb interaction , vacuum polarization , darwin - foldy , and magnetic moment terms , with appropriate proton and neutron form factors : @xmath35 the @xmath36 contain spin - spin , tensor , and spin - orbit components .",
    "detailed expressions for these terms , including the form factors , are given in ref .",
    "these terms should be included in calculations aiming for better than 99% accuracy .",
    "for example , the contribution of @xmath37(np ) to the binding energy of the deuteron is @xmath38 0.02 mev , i.e. 1% of the total .",
    "the one - pion - exchange part of the potential includes the charge - dependent ( cd ) terms due to the difference in neutral and charged pion masses .",

    ". we will refer to the potential from the @xmath50 terms as @xmath51 and from the @xmath52 term as @xmath53 .",

    "the potential was fit directly to the nijmegen @xmath4 scattering data base  @xcite containing 1787 @xmath11 and 2514 @xmath12 data in the range @xmath54 mev , with a @xmath55 per datum of 1.09 .",
    "it was also fit to the @xmath56 scattering length measured in @xmath57 experiments and the deuteron binding energy .",
    "there could in principle be more charge - independence - breaking ( cib ) terms such as @xmath58 or @xmath59 but the scattering data are not sufficiently precise to identify them at present .",
    "the urbana series of three - nucleon potentials is written as a sum of two - pion - exchange and shorter - range phenomenological terms , @xmath60 the two - pion - exchange term can be expressed simply as @xmath61             [ \\tau_{i}\\cdot\\tau_{j},\\tau_{j}\\cdot\\tau_{k } ] \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath62 is constructed with an average pion mass , @xmath63 .",
    "the anticommutator and commutator terms are denoted by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , and for the urbana models @xmath66 , as in the original fujita - miyazawa model  @xcite .",
    "the shorter - range phenomenological term is given by @xmath67 the parameters for model ix are @xmath68 mev and @xmath69 mev . they have been determined by fitting the density of nuclear matter and the binding energy of @xmath14h in conjunction with the argonne @xmath1 interaction .",
    "these values are only slightly different from the model viii values , @xmath70 mev and @xmath71 mev , that were adjusted for use with the older argonne @xmath72 interaction . in principle",
    ", the @xmath73 can have other terms  @xcite , however we need additional data to obtain their strengths ; presumably a part of it is due to relativistic effects  @xcite .",
    "direct gfmc calculations with the full interaction ( in particular spin - dependent terms which involve the square of the momentum operator ) have very large statistical errors , for reasons that will be discussed in section iv . also the cib terms in @xmath74",
    "are fairly weak and therefore can be treated conveniently as a first order perturbation .",
    "further , using a wave function of good isospin significantly reduces the cost of the calculations .",
    "hence we construct the gfmc propagator with a simpler isoscalar hamiltonian , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is defined as @xmath77 the interaction @xmath76 has only eight operator terms , with operators @xmath78\\otimes[1,({\\bf\\tau_{i}}\\cdot{\\bf\\tau_{j}})]$ ] , chosen such that it equals the isoscalar part of the full interaction in all @xmath79 and @xmath80 waves as well as in the @xmath81 wave and its coupling to the @xmath82 .",

    "note that in @xmath14h and @xmath15he the two - body cluster gives zero contribution to @xmath92 since they are identical in low partial waves .",
    "we compensate for this tendency towards overbinding by using a @xmath94 in which the repulsive @xmath95 term of eq.([eq : vrijk ] ) has been increased by @xmath96 in the @xmath86 .",

    "this rapid increase in computation time will be a serious obstacle to extending these calculations beyond eight - body nuclei on presently available computers .",

    "the increased speed is approximately attributable to 1 ) using the exact two - body propagator ( factor of 3 ) , 2 ) dropping the @xmath137 term in the @xmath262 ( factor 2 ) , 3 ) improvements in the calculation of the wave functions ( factor 3 ) , and 4 ) reduction of processor idle time ( factor 1.4 ) .",
    "in this section we consider several aspects of our calculations that could introduce systematic errors in the gfmc results , and attempt to place limits on these errors .",
    "there are two major sources of error : due to the fermion sign problem , the gfmc propagation can not be extended to arbitrary large imaginary time and thus admixtures of low - energy excitations in the trial wave function will not be fully removed , and the gfmc propagation must be done with a different hamiltonian from the desired one .",
    "we also investigate the effects of the time step size .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma_of_tau ] shows the statistical errors as a function of imaginary time for calculations of @xmath245 for various nuclei using 50,000 initial configurations .",
    "the errors grow dramatically with increasing @xmath120 due to the increasingly poorer quality of the @xmath262 . in these calculations ,",
    "@xmath503 is evaluated by having @xmath74 act entirely to the left , therefore if @xmath262 is an eigenfunction of @xmath74 , the sampling errors will be nil as per eq .",

    "the errors increase exponentially with @xmath26 .",
    "this is the well - known fermion sign problem ; the @xmath22-shell nuclei suffer much less from this problem  @xcite .",
    "this exponential error growth places an effective limit of @xmath500=0.06 mev@xmath24 on our calculations for @xmath27 nuclei , which means that admixtures of states of excitation energy less than @xmath3812 mev in @xmath20 , will be damped by less than 50% .",
    "this led us in ref .",
    "@xcite to attempt to extrapolate the computed @xmath504 to @xmath25 by fitting them with @xmath505 where @xmath506 is the extrapolated energy , and the strengths of contaminating states in @xmath507 are approximated with a few @xmath508 at excitation energies @xmath509 .",

    "calculations without the @xmath136 would be about 20% faster than full calculations , but the poorer quality of @xmath20 without @xmath136 increases the statistical errors at large @xmath26 by about 20% , and thus requires 40% more configurations to get the same error .",
    "therefore it is not economical to drop the @xmath136 from @xmath20 .    the open diamonds in fig .",

    "the statistical errors from such a bad @xmath20 are much larger .",

    "deficiencies in the one - body part of @xmath20 present more of a problem . as is discussed in sec .",
    "iii , the @xmath234 for @xmath2he has two symmetry components : [ 2 ] and [ 11 ] ; the optimal amplitudes for these ( see table  [ table : beta6 ] ) are 0.967 and @xmath546 , respectively .",
    "the solid circles in fig .",

    "however , because this error is entirely due to a low energy excitation , the gfmc makes very little improvement by @xmath548 mev@xmath24 .",
    "a less radical case is shown by the open diamonds which correspond to a @xmath20 with amplitudes of @xmath549 for the two states .",
    "the @xmath504 starts out 1.6 mev above that of the best @xmath20 ; the gfmc reduces this to @xmath550 mev at @xmath23 mev@xmath24 .",
    "the solid curve is a single - energy fit to these results ; the fitted excitation energy is @xmath551 mev and the extrapolated @xmath552 is well above the @xmath553 from the best @xmath20 .",
    "fits with two excitations , one constrained to 5.0 mev , give an essentially flat @xmath55 , and are not useful to extract the @xmath506 .",
    "a similar situation arose in our first gfmc calculation for the ground state of @xmath3he .",
    "this was made with just the dominant @xmath209p[21 ] component .",
    "a subsequent calculation using the three components listed in table  [ table : beta7 ] lowered all the @xmath504 by @xmath554  mev ; the first @xmath555 excited state is at only 2  mev so we would have to propagate 10 times further for the gfmc to substantially correct this error .",
    "it is important that the @xmath20 have the correct admixtures of different symmetry , and other low - lying states .",
    "otherwise the gfmc results will only be upper bounds to the exact eigenenergies .",
    "for this reason the @xmath20 used in this work are obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in the small bases of low - energy shell - model states as discussed in sec .",
    "such diagonalizations can be used to ascertain if an improved @xmath556 will influence the gfmc results obtained with @xmath20 .",
    "the hamiltonian should be diagonalized between @xmath556 and @xmath20 , taking into account their nonorthogonality .",
    "if the difference in the eigenvalues is large compared to @xmath557 the results will not be influenced ; if it is small , the superposition corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue must be used . as examples of this , we made such diagonalizations for the cases studied above , in which @xmath104 or just a four - operator @xmath20 were used .",
    "these gave excitation energies of @xmath558  mev and @xmath559  mev , respectively , which are in good agreement with the observed @xmath504 .",
    "our best @xmath100 contains @xmath560 and @xmath108 correlations omitted from the @xmath20 due to computational costs . diagonalizing the hamiltonian within @xmath100 and @xmath20 shows that these correlations admix states with excitation energies of @xmath561 and 300 mev , respectively .",
    "thus they can be safely left out of the @xmath20 .    as is discussed in sec .",
    "iii , the vmc calculations for @xmath5-shell nuclei do not have a local variational minimum for reasonable rms radii .",
    "therefore the variational searches were constrained to have radii close to the experimental values , if such values are known .",
    "to study the sensitivity of the gfmc results to this assumption , we have made a number of gfmc calculations of the @xmath2li ground state using @xmath20 that have different rms radii .",
    "these @xmath20 were made by changing the depth ( @xmath562 ) and radius ( @xmath164 ) of the woods - saxon well used to make the @xmath5-wave orbitals ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : spwell ] ) ) ; thus the @xmath15he core was not directly modified .",
    "figure  [ fig:6li_rmsr ] shows the evolution of the rms radius with @xmath26 for these calculations ; the solid circles correspond to the @xmath20 used in the rest of this paper .",
    "we see that the gfmc basically makes no change to the radii , even though they span a range of almost 30% ( there may be some indication that the smallest radii are increased at small @xmath26 ) .",
    "this is probably because completely separating the deuteron from the @xmath15he core corresponds to only a 1.5 mev excitation .",
    "figure  [ fig:6li_e_vs_rmsr ] shows the gfmc energies from these calculations as a function of the gfmc radii ( both are averages of the @xmath563  mev@xmath24 values ) , and the corresponding @xmath20 expectation values .",
    "the variational energies obtained with @xmath20 decrease monotonically with increasing rms radius , but the gfmc energies show a weak minimum ; the very large radii yield higher gfmc energies and thus can be variationally ruled out .",
    "the curve is a parabolic fit to the five gfmc energies with smallest rms radii ; the minimum is at 2.44 fm .",
    "however the curve is very flat and the uncertainty in the location of the minimum is at least 0.1 fm .",
    "thus even when 50,000 to 280,000 initial configurations are used for each point , it is difficult to extract the @xmath2li rms radius . given this , it is not possible at present to reliably study the radii of @xmath27 nuclei .",
    "the gfmc propagator used in these calculations has two possible sources of error .",
    "the first is that the time step , @xmath564 mev@xmath24 , might be too large .",
    "we have checked this by two calculations .",
    "for @xmath14h we made calculations to @xmath23 mev@xmath24 using both @xmath565 and 0.00025 mev@xmath24 ; these were different by 0.016(14 ) mev .",
    "for @xmath15he we made calculations to @xmath541 mev@xmath24 using both @xmath565 and 0.0001 mev@xmath24 ; these were different by 0.02(6 ) mev .",
    "the statistical errors in our gfmc energies for @xmath5-shell nuclei are all @xmath566  mev ; thus these time - step effects are negligible .",
    "the second possible source is that we can not use a propagator for the full hamiltonian , @xmath74 , that we are interested in .",
    "rather we must use the @xmath86 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hgfmc ] ) and compute @xmath567 perturbatively .",
    "kamada and glckle @xcite have estimated for @xmath14h that evaluating @xmath568 in wave functions appropriate for @xmath76 underestimates the binding energy by @xmath569  kev ; scaling this by the total two - body potential energy gives @xmath570  kev in @xmath15he and @xmath571  kev in @xmath3li .",
    "we constructed a @xmath15he @xmath100 that is optimized for @xmath572 and used it to compute @xmath568 ; this gives 60(15 )  kev less binding than our best @xmath15he variational wave function in agreement with the above estimates .    using a propagator for an @xmath86 that gives more binding than @xmath74 can introduce small errors in the determination of densities and radii .",
    "the more tightly bound eigenstate of @xmath86 is likely to have a smaller radius .",
    "the radii of @xmath15he can be calculated more accurately , and we have studied their sensitivity to various propagators .",
    "the rms radius for @xmath20 optimized for @xmath74 is 1.482(3 )  fm . a gfmc calculation using an @xmath86 with no @xmath573 and @xmath574 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : hgfmc ] ) ) gives @xmath575  mev and an rms radius of 1.418(4 ) .",
    "however using the @xmath573 and @xmath576 in @xmath94 results in @xmath577  mev and an rms radius of 1.446(3 )  fm .",
    "presumably the later value is more correct , while the former is too small due to the overbinding .    as is discussed in sec .",
    "iv , the gfmc directly computes mixed estimates @xmath578 .",
    "except for @xmath86 and operators that commute with it , these must be corrected to obtain the desired @xmath291 ; we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : pc_gfmc ] ) to achieve this .",
    "consequently , the expectation values of the individual energy components , such as @xmath579 , @xmath76 , and @xmath94 , which have errors of order @xmath580 , do not sum to the correct total energy .",
    "indeed , there must be a collective error in these individual terms equal to the total difference between the gfmc @xmath581 and the vmc @xmath582 .",
    "this is illustrated in table  [ table : pc_cor ] for the case of @xmath2li , where the difference @xmath583 is @xmath584 mev , and the sum of the individual @xmath585 is an additional @xmath584 mev lower than @xmath586 . in this case , the individual corrections are comparable in magnitude to the collective error , but small compared to the total expectation values .    aside from our own work in ref .",

    "we have calculated vmc and gfmc excitation energies for eight states , and they agree with each other within error bars in all cases . therefore , we may expect that the vmc excitation energies for the other states shown are close to the correct results for this hamiltonian .",
    "most of these higher states are obtained by the diagonalizations within correlated @xmath5-shell states discussed in sec.iii .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_spectra ] we see that the difference between the calculated and experimental energies increases as @xmath120 and @xmath628 increase .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex_spectra ] , the excitation spectra are in good overall agreement with experiment",
    ". the states generally occur in the correct order , and with reasonable energies .",
    "the agreement with the @xmath2li and low - lying @xmath3li spectra is very good .",
    "in particular , the first excited @xmath184 state in @xmath2li , and the first excited @xmath257 state in @xmath3li , i.e. , the first excited states with quantum numbers identical to the ground states , are very close to the observed excitations . in the case of @xmath2he and @xmath3he",
    ", we predict a number of states that have not been observed experimentally , but which could be searched for . a first observation of the second @xmath173 state in @xmath2he was recently reported  @xcite ; the experimenters tried to fit their data with single states of different @xmath18 but did not get a very good fit for any one value .",
    "our results suggest there are several states close together in this region , which could improve the chances of fitting the data satisfactorily .",
    "the states in @xmath3he might also be amenable to experimental measurement with the new radioactive beam facilities that are now coming on line .",
    "energy differences of isobaric analog states are sensitive probes of the charge - independence - breaking parts of the hamiltonian . to study these",
    "it is useful to express the energies in an isobaric multiplet , characterized by @xmath120 and @xmath627 , in terms of the isospin multipole operators of order @xmath221 : @xmath629 the @xmath630 are orthogonal functions for projecting out isovector , isotensor , and higher - order terms  @xcite ; the first terms are @xmath631 , @xmath632 , and @xmath633 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath634 are then obtained from @xmath635    in first - order perturbation theory , the electromagnetic interaction contributes to the @xmath634 for @xmath636 and 2 , the nuclear csb potential and kinetic energy contribute to @xmath636 , and the nuclear cd potential contributes to @xmath637 .",
    "the @xmath634 for higher @xmath221 are zero in first order with our hamiltonian , and there is little experimental evidence for @xmath638 terms in nuclei  @xcite .",
    "we have made vmc calculations of the @xmath639 in first order by using a ci wave function of good isospin , @xmath627 , and simply varying @xmath640 to compute the @xmath641 .",
    "table  [ table : analog ] contains results for the @xmath208 isovector ( @xmath636 ) coefficients in @xmath642 and @xmath27 , the @xmath643 isovector and isotensor ( @xmath637 ) coefficients in @xmath10 , and the @xmath219 isovector and isotensor coefficients in @xmath27 .",
    "the energy differences are broken down into @xmath37 , @xmath51 , @xmath53 , and @xmath644 contributions , with the @xmath11 coulomb , [ @xmath645 , other coulomb ( @xmath646 ) , and magnetic moment ( @xmath647 ) components of @xmath37 also given .",
    "the cib parts of the hamiltonian induce cd changes in the nuclear wave function , leading to higher - order perturbative corrections to the splittings of the isospin multiplets . we have estimated some of these changes in vmc by repeating the calculations using wave functions that have a varying coulomb term , @xmath648 of eq.([eq : vcan ] ) , added to the single - particle potential well that is used to generate the @xmath649 components of @xmath100 .",
    "this results in a slightly more diffuse wave function as @xmath650 increases , and slightly smaller energy coefficients than those obtained with ci wave functions . in the gfmc calculations , the isoscalar coulomb term , @xmath594 ,",
    "provides an additional source of cib through the propagating hamiltonian of eq.([eq : hgfmc ] ) , which depends on @xmath640 .",
    "however , within the limited propagation time of @xmath23 mev@xmath24 , the main effect of using gfmc wave functions seems to be the slightly sharper two - body densities ( discussed below ) around 1 fm , and consequent changes in the cib potential expectation values .",
    "all our gfmc calculations have been made with cd wave functions , but a complete set of isobaric analog states was calculated only for @xmath120=6 , results for which are shown on the penultimate line of table  [ table : analog ]",
    ". there may also be higher - order contributions to the isomultiplet splittings from changes to the ci expectation values , but we have no reliable way of extracting these from under the sizeable monte carlo errors .",
    "the results tabulated in table  [ table : analog ] indicate that the present hamiltonian underestimates the observed isovector coefficients and gives mixed results for the isotensors .",
    "it should be remembered , however , that while @xmath51 is well determined in the @xmath651 partial wave by the @xmath4 scattering data , it is much less well known in @xmath652 and higher partial waves , while the only experimental input for @xmath53 is the @xmath56-@xmath11 scattering length difference , which has a 20% experimental uncertainty .",
    "the @xmath642 case would be corrected by a @xmath653 increase in @xmath53 , but this would not explain much of the discrepancy in the larger nuclei .",
    "the significant underbinding of the @xmath16 nuclei with the present hamiltonian may mean that our wave functions for these nuclei are more diffuse than they should be .",
    "by far the worst discrepancy is for the @xmath654 case , where the underbinding of the ground states is also the largest .",
    "if the hamiltonian were altered , e.g. , by increasing the net attraction from the three - nucleon interaction , to obtain the correct binding , the contribution of the cib forces to the isovector coefficients should be increased , both in the dominant @xmath11 coulomb term , and the short - range @xmath53 .",
    "it is more difficult to predict the effect of such changes on the isotensor energy coefficients .",
    "the one- and two - nucleon distributions of light @xmath5-shell nuclei are interesting in a variety of experimental settings .",
    "for example , the @xmath2he nucleus has been a popular candidate for study as a halo nucleus whose last two neutrons are weakly bound .",
    "in addition , the polarization densities of @xmath2li and @xmath3li are important because of possible applications in polarized targets . in order to extract information on the spin - dependent nucleon properties from experiments on such targets one must ,",
    "at a minimum , understand the nucleon polarization in the polarized nucleus .",
    "in this section we provide our results for a variety of nucleon distributions , including spin - polarized and averaged single - nucleon densities , spin - dependent and spin - independent two - body densities , the proton - proton distributions , and the rms radii , magnetic moments , and quadrupole moments .    as was discussed in sec .",
    "vi , we do not propagate to large enough imaginary time to allow the gfmc to significantly modify the rms radius of the @xmath5-shell nuclei .",
    "thus they are determined almost entirely by the input trial wave function , which is constrained to be near the experimental value wherever known .",
    "however gfmc does make significant changes to densities at small @xmath358 .",
    "a number of the one - body densities are increased near the origin , as are the peaks of many of the two - body densities .",
    "the proton rms radii and static electromagnetic properties are given in table  [ table : radii ] .",
    "these are calculated from @xmath100 using impulse approximation . in general , we know that there are significant corrections to the electromagnetic moments from two - body charge and current contributions  @xcite .",
    "for the magnetic moments , these corrections are only @xmath38 1 - 2% in isoscalar nuclei like @xmath209h , but are @xmath38 15 - 20% in the isovector @xmath208 nuclei @xmath14h and @xmath14he .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that we see very little discrepancy for the magnetic moment in @xmath2li , but a sizeable error for @xmath3li ; presumably , a calculation including meson - exchange contributions would come much closer to the experimental values in the latter case . the quadrupole moment is a more difficult problem , particularly in @xmath2li , where there is a delicate cancellation between the contributions from the deuteron quadrupole moment and the @xmath655-wave part of the @xmath160-@xmath656 relative wave function .",
    "many cluster models for @xmath2li fail to obtain the observed negative sign ; we have trouble getting an accurate measure of the magnitude , for reasons discussed above . in the case of @xmath3li , where there is no such delicate cancellation ,",
    "the value is only @xmath38 15 - 20% too low in magnitude .",
    "again , some of this discrepancy might be made up by meson - exchange corrections .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : np_dens_he ] , we present the neutron and proton densities for the helium isotopes , calculated with gfmc .",
    "previously we have found that the @xmath15he charge form factor is in good agreement with experimental data in realistic calculations  @xcite , and hence this distribution should be quite accurate . as more neutrons are added , the tails of the distributions broaden considerably because of the relatively weak binding of the @xmath5-shell neutrons .",
    "in addition , the central neutron and proton densities decrease rather dramatically .",
    "this effect does not necessarily require any changes to the alpha - particle core , but can be understood at least partially from the fact that the alpha particle no longer sits at the center of mass of the entire system .",
    "the motion relative to the center of mass spreads out the mass distribution relative to that of @xmath15he .",
    "we also find that the small depression obtained in the central density of @xmath15he gradually disappears as more nucleons are added .",
    "while the depression is clear in the alpha particle , it is nearly within our statistical errors in @xmath2he and seems to have disappeared completely in @xmath3he .",
    "this can again be understood by taking into account the fluctuations in the center of mass of the core nucleons about the center of mass of the entire system .",
    "[ fig : np_dens_li ] shows the gfmc neutron and proton densities for the lithium isotopes .",
    "these densities are very smooth functions of the distance from the center of mass .",
    "the polarization densities for @xmath2li and @xmath3li , computed with vmc are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : spin_dens_li6 ] and [ fig : spin_dens_li7 ] , respectively .",
    "the spin - up proton density distribution is defined by @xmath657 with similar definitions for spin - down protons , spin - up neutrons , etc .",
    "the integral of these distributions is the total number of spin - up ( down ) protons ( neutrons ) in a fully polarized state .",
    "the integrated quantities can be important in high - energy experiments designed to probe the spin - dependence of the neutron or proton structure functions , while their radial dependence may be partially accessible in experiments at lower energies .",
    "experimentalists are considering using dense , solid polarized @xmath2lid targets , as an alternative to the deuterated ammonia targets currently being used to probe neutron properties .",
    "polarization densities have been studied previously in cluster models , with a fixed ( unpolarized ) alpha core plus interacting valence nucleons .",
    "our calculations include the possibility of the spins in the the core alpha particle being polarized by the valence nucleon s spin and orbital angular momentum , and hence it is interesting to examine the results for both the distributions and the integrated quantities .    in the spin projection @xmath658 state of the deuteron ,",
    "the polarization of the neutron differs from unity because the tensor interaction induces a d - state in the wave function .",
    "integrating @xmath659 over @xmath358 yields a probability for up - spin neutrons of @xmath660 where @xmath661 and @xmath662 are the s- and d - wave probabilities of the deuteron . in the simplest two - body ( alpha plus deuteron ) model of @xmath2li , the polarization of the neutrons",
    "is determined by the d - state probability in the deuteron and the d - state probability in the @xmath663 wave function . in three - body models",
    ", recent calculations  @xcite have found that the valence neutron had @xmath664 . since in such a model",
    "the two core neutrons are unpolarized , this corresponds to a total projection @xmath665 of 1.93 , or a polarization of 29% .    as expected , the up spins dominate the down spins in the @xmath658 state of @xmath2li at large distances from the center of mass . at very large separations",
    ", the ratio will be determined solely by the asymptotic d / s state normalization of the alpha - deuteron wave function and the @xmath655-state probability in the deuteron . at small r",
    ", we find that the spin - down density exceeds the spin - up density , presumably because the spins of the outer nucleons prefer to try to pair with the core nucleons to a spin - zero state .",
    "even though we find this effect to be significant , the integrated spin densities agree reasonably well with the cluster model calculations .",
    "the integrated neutron densities in @xmath2li are found to be 1.93 for spin up and 1.07 for spin down , respectively , yielding the same net polarization of 29% .",
    "the @xmath666 in @xmath3li is found to be 1.94 instead of 2 as predicted by the independent - particle shell model .",
    "the neutrons carry about half this remaining spin , as the spin - up and spin - down neutron integrated densities are 1.98 and 2.02 .",
    "we have also computed a variety of two - nucleon distribution functions .",
    "these are defined by @xmath667 where the operators @xmath668 are given in eq.([eq : osix ] ) .",
    "while typically these two - body correlations can not be directly measured , they provide the expectation values of two - body operators and can be important ingredients in interpreting the results of experiments .",
    "transition matrix elements of this type are needed for extracting the effective weak @xmath669 coupling constant in parity - violating experiments .",
    "[ fig : li6_ttdenr ] shows vmc and gfmc calculations of the @xmath670 @xmath4 pair distribution function .",
    "this correlation is strongly dominated by pion exchange , and is responsible for the toroidal shapes which characterize the coupling of spin to space in the nucleus@xcite .",
    "we see that the structure is somewhat enhanced by the gfmc .",
    "finally , we present the proton - proton distributions ( scaled to have normalization integrals of @xmath671 ) for @xmath15he , @xmath2he , @xmath3he , @xmath2li , and @xmath3li in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppcorr ] . these distributions",
    "are directly related to the coulomb sum measured in inclusive longitudinal electron scattering ; such measurements in @xmath14he have been used@xcite to put constraints on the @xmath672 , and realistic calculations agree with the experimental results@xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath673 at short distances is largely determined by the repulsive core of the @xmath4 potential and is nearly independent of the nucleus , but at larger distances it is determined by the size of the nucleus .",
    "we show results for @xmath674 in @xmath2he and @xmath3he in order to directly compare the alpha particle proton - proton distribution to that in the alpha - particle cores of @xmath2he and @xmath3he . unlike the one - body densities , these distributions are not sensitive to center of mass effects .",
    "we find that the proton - proton distribution spreads out slightly with neutron number in the helium isotopes , with an increase of the pair rms radius of approximately 4% in going from @xmath15he to @xmath2he , and 7% to @xmath3he .",
    "while this could be interpreted as a swelling of the alpha core , it might also be due to the charge - exchange ( @xmath242 ) correlations which can transfer the charge from the core to the valence nucleons .",
    "since these correlations are rather long - ranged , they can have a significant effect on the proton - proton distribution .    finally , we mention that calculations of the electromagnetic ground - state and transition form factors are underway .",
    "complete results for these quantities , including exchange current effects , will appear in a separate paper .",
    "quantum monte carlo methods are now a powerful tool for the study of light @xmath5-shell nuclei . at present",
    ", we can write plausible variational wave functions with the proper quantum numbers for the given state of interest , but they do not give sufficient binding to provide stability against breakup into subclusters .",
    "however , the gfmc method rapidly damps out the small amount of highly - excited states contained in the vmc wave functions , producing ground states that are stable in the case of @xmath2li and @xmath3li .",
    "the current major limitation is the small value of @xmath26 that can be reached in most calculations .",
    "this makes it important that the starting vmc wave functions have a proper mix of the appropriate spatial symmetries , and negligible contamination from low - energy excited states .",
    "the energies obtained for the ground and low - lying excited states are close to , but somewhat above , the experimental numbers .",
    "we believe the discrepancy is probably the fault of the hamiltonian , most likely the phenomenological short - range part of the three - nucleon interaction , rather than a shortcoming of the calculation .",
    "we note that the difference between experimental and theoretical energies is much less that @xmath93 , and might be rectified by an improved three - nucleon potential . despite the discrepancies in the ground state energies",
    ", the excitation spectra are reproduced very well .",
    "we believe this is the first demonstration that the shell structure of light nuclei can be obtained directly from bare two - nucleon interactions that fit @xmath4 scattering data .",
    "the qmc methods developed here can be extended to eight - body nuclei with the present generation of computers .",
    "we already have calculations in progress for the ground and low - lying excited states of @xmath675 nuclei .",
    "the next major task will be to refine our model for the three - nucleon interaction , perhaps including those relativistic corrections which first appear at the three - nucleon level  @xcite , with the intention of fitting the energies of @xmath120=3 - 8 nuclear states with 1% accuracy .",
    "now that accurate qmc calculations of these states are possible , there are a host of interesting problems that become accessible , including the response of @xmath2li and @xmath3li to electron scattering , and many low - energy electroweak capture reactions of astrophysical interest , such as @xmath15he@xmath676li and @xmath3be@xmath677b .",
    "there also remains the problem of adapting the gfmc methods here to the study of larger systems , perhaps through methods similar to the cluster - expansion used in vmc calculations of @xmath678o  @xcite .",
