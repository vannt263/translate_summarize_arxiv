    "in this contribution i would like to address the following question : what is the surface of an evolving black hole ? concentrating on the case of asymptotically flat black holes @xcite , the standard candidate is the event horizon ( eh ) .",
    "unfortunately , eh suffers from a serious problem : it is teleological , depending on the whole future evolution of the spacetime .",
    "however , if a black hole is evolving or forming , we would like to know how to recognize it and we , of course , do not control nor know the entire future evolution of the spacetime .",
    "this led to the definition of some quasi - local objects , essentially the _ future outer trapping horizons _ @xcite and the _ dynamical horizons _",
    "@xcite , in order to characterize the boundary of asymptotically flat black holes , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "both of these quasi - local objects are spacelike _ marginally trapped tubes _",
    "@xcite : hypersurfaces foliated by marginally future - trapped closed surfaces .",
    "it turns out , however , that these quasi - local horizons are not unique in general @xcite .",
    "even more problematic , they do not separate regions with and without future - trapped surfaces , as follows from the result in @xcite : closed future - trapped surfaces can penetrate flat regions of imploding vaidya spacetimes .",
    "this will be summarized in the next section .",
    "thus the quasi - local horizons are of limited use concerning the question under study .",
    "on the other hand , eardley @xcite conjectured that the eh is the boundary of the set of marginally _ outer _",
    "future - trapped closed surfaces these are compact surfaces with vanishing outer expansion , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this conjecture holds true for the imploding vaidya spacetimes @xcite .",
    "an obvious question arises : what is the boundary @xmath0 of the set of truly future - trapped closed surfaces ?",
    "@xmath0 is a boundary enclosing the region _ where _ dynamical and future outer trapping horizons can exist .",
    "it follows that @xmath0 is a good candidate for the sought `` surface of a black hole '' , for it is the genesis of quasi - local horizons and f - trapped closed surfaces .",
    "hence , @xmath0 is the main object to be analyzed herein . in @xcite",
    "it was proven that @xmath1 eh in general . moreover , from the mentioned result in @xcite follows that @xmath0 does penetrate flat portions of imploding black hole spacetimes , which immediately rules out the quasi - local horizons as candidates for @xmath0 .",
    "actually , @xmath0 can not contain any marginally future - trapped closed surface .",
    "this , together with other results for @xmath0 found in @xcite , will be presented here . even though the techniques can be used in general situations ,",
    "i will concentrate on the case of spherical symmetry . for this case ,",
    "very definite limits on the location of @xmath0 will be given .",
    "for the exact characterization and precise location  of @xmath0 in spherical symmetry readers are referred to @xcite .",
