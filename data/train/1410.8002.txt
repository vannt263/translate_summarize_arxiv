    "<S> a few years ago new data were published @xcite for the @xmath1 process , where one of the photons is far off mass shell ( large @xmath2 ) and the other one is near mass shell ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements of the photon - pion transition form factor @xmath0 , taken in single - tagged two - photon @xmath4 reaction , was performed in a wide range of momentum transfer squared ( @xmath5 gev@xmath6 ) . at sufficiently high @xmath2 </S>",

    "<S> there were many theoretical papers speculating why the data should ( or not ) obey the bl limit @xcite . the first attempt to explain the babar result </S>",
    "<S> can be found in ref . @xcite . among these </S>",
    "<S> there were proposals claiming that the pion distribution amplitude should be modified @xcite , leading to a broader or flatter distribution in the place of the asymptotic form @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a flat da would be consistent with the babar data , although a field theoretical support for such possibility is still missing . </S>",
    "<S> some papers claim that other transition form factors of heavier mesons are compatible among themselves and with the saturation required by factorization theorems obtained from pqcd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for heavier mesons than the pion the da may be more peaked away from the end points @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a common statement in all papers is the need for more data to settle this problem .    </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the pion transition form factor is the most sensitive physical quantity to observe a non - perturbative contribution to the da . </S>",
    "<S> other quantities , for instance , like the pion form factor , may already contain a hard scattering amplitude at leading order with a soft behavior , due to the effect of extra coupling constants or gluon propagators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this means that they do not lead to such a simple integral over a da as the one shown by eq.([eqa ] ) . as claimed in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we may assume that at present there is no definite conclusion on which is the asymptotic form of the pion da , and it is possible that in the future a combined analysis of data of the processes involving pions will shed light on the pion distribution amplitude @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notwithstanding , considering the possibility that a flatter pion da seems to be favored by the babar data @xcite , we can establish a field theoretical limit on how flat this da can be , and , consequently , compare this limit to the experimental data . in order to do this </S>",
    "<S> we will study the da dependence on the non - perturbative dynamics of the theory , and ultimately on the asymptotic behavior of the pion - quark vertex and the quark self - energy .    </S>",
    "<S> like in the nambu - jona - lasinio four - fermion approach , in qcd or any asymptotically free non - abelian gauge theory , the fermion masses are dynamically generated along with bound state goldstone bosons ( the pions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical quark mass ( @xmath14 ) , giving by the schwinger - dyson equation is exactly identical to the pseudoscalar bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) at zero momentum transfer ( @xmath15 ) , as demonstrated by delbourgo and scadron @xcite @xmath16 which is a consequence of the fact that they are related through the ward - takahashi identity .    </S>",
    "<S> the homogeneous bse can be , in general , written as @xmath17 where the amplitude depends on the quarks total ( @xmath18 ) and relative ( @xmath19 ) momenta , with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the momentum fraction parameter . in eq.([eq02 ] ) @xmath24 is the fully amputated quark - antiquark scattering kernel , @xmath25 are the dressed quark propagators , and the homogeneous bse is valid on - shell , i.e. @xmath26 in the pion case . </S>",
    "<S> note that we suppressed all indices ( color , etc ... ) in eq.([eq02 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the bse , eq.([eq02 ] ) , is an integral equation that can be transformed into a second order differential equation . </S>",

    "<S> the asymptotic expression shown in eq.([eq1a ] ) was determined in the appendix of ref.@xcite and it satisfies the callan - symanzik equation . </S>",
    "<S> this last solution is constrained by the bse normalization condition @xcite , which imply @xmath34 , or @xmath35 @xcite , otherwise it is not consistent with a possible bound state solution in a @xmath36 non - abelian gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> we will take @xmath37 as will be explained later . </S>",
    "<S> this solution is one alternative to the soft one ( @xmath38 ) @xcite which leads to the standard da @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays it is known that we may have solutions with a momentum behavior varying between eq.([eq03 ] ) and eq.([eq1a ] ) depending on the theory dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) can be transformed into a second order differential equation . </S>",
    "<S> this equation has two possible solutions , one that asymptotically behaves as @xmath40 as in eq.(5 ) and the other one as @xmath41^{-\\gamma}$ ] ( eq.(6 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however this result comes out from the homogeneous bse . </S>",
    "<S> the non - homogeneous bse also includes a normalization condition , as discussed in refs.[27,30,31 ] , that is obeyed by eq.(5 ) but when applied to eq.(6 ) implies @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this constraint appears because the wave function is very  hard \" , i.e. decreases very slowly with the momentum and can not be normalized ( square integrable ) if @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this condition on @xmath44 gives the bound @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this limit on @xmath44 was obtained by mandelstam in ref.[30 ] , in qcd for the first time in ref.[27 ] and recently , in a different context , in ref.[31 ] . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath45 only the solution of eq.(5 ) exists , because it would be the only one obeying the bse normalization condition . </S>",
    "<S> this also means that if @xmath46 qcd may have a chiral broken phase whose self - energy is given by eq.(6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays it is known that the chiral phase diagram for a non - abelian theory may change considerably as we change the number of flavors . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if the theory contains contributions of higher order operators it may have its quark self - energy or bound state solution varying between eq.(5 ) and ( 6 ) as discussed in ref.[33 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we are just saying that if @xmath42 eq.(6 ) is a possible bound state solution , and the hardest one that we may have .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued that eq.([eq1a ] ) may be a realistic wave function in a scenario where the chiral symmetry breaking is associated to confinement and the gluons have a dynamically generated mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this solution also appears when using an improved renormalization group approach in qcd , associated to a finite quark condensate @xcite , and it minimizes the vacuum energy as long as @xmath35 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this specific solution is the only one consistent with regge - pole like solutions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the important fact is that this is the hardest ( in momentum space ) asymptotic behavior allowed for a bound state solution in a non - abelian gauge theory , and it is exactly for this reason that the constraint on @xmath44 arises from the bse normalization condition . </S>",
    "<S> no matter this solution is realized in nature or not , it will lead to the flattest pion da , any other flatter distribution than this one can not be a realistic bse wave function , and would not be consistent with a composite pion . </S>",
    "<S> a totally flat da can only be related to a fundamental pion . a realistic da , in principle , </S>",
    "<S> should be related to a solution of the bse and should obey a normalization condition peculiar to a well behaved wave function .    </S>",
    "<S> the infrared behavior of the gap equation ( or bse ) is approximately constant at small momenta , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , of order of a few hundred mev , is the characteristic scale of dynamical quark mass generation . in order to compute the pion da </S>",
    "<S> we will perform an integral over the wave function in the full range of momenta ( i.e. up to @xmath49 , this is why we will consider @xmath50 ) . to obtain the extreme field theoretical limit on the pion da , we shall also work with a simple interpolating expression that roughly reflects the full behavior of the hardest \" quark self - energy ( or bse solution ) discussed in the previous paragraphs , namely @xcite @xmath51   ^{-\\gamma}\\ , . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , this is just one possible ansatz for the full behavior of the self - energy and other possible interpolations between the ir and ultraviolet ( uv ) behaviors are possible , but as long as @xmath14 shows the logarithmic uv behavior our final result will not change . </S>",

    "<S> the leading asymptotic behavior of the form factor is expressed through the pion da ( [ eq3a ] ) as @xcite @xmath91 if we were considering a totally flat da this integral would diverge . however , as emphasized by radyushkin @xcite , the finite size @xmath92 of the pion should provide a cut - off for the @xmath93 integral . </S>",

    "<S> [ fasmod]@xmath95 being a dynamical mass should have a momentum dependence showing the decrease of the mass with the momentum . </S>",

    "<S> radyushkin @xcite and polyakov @xcite have proposed a flat behavior for the pion da in the light of babar data . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior , if it indeed happens in nature , should be justified field theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that a flat behavior for the pion da is totally dependent on the asymptotic uv logarithmic behavior of the self - energy . when the pion da is calculated with eq.([eq1 ] ) using softer quark self - energies the result turns out to be more peaked at @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the self - energy behavior at small and intermediate momenta are erased by the normalization condition eq.([eq1b ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the high energy limit of the pion transition form factor with a flat da must have a natural cut - off ( @xmath95 ) as proposed by radyushkin @xcite and polyakov @xcite , and this one was introduced by us into eq.([fasmod ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed a cut - off of the order of the dynamical masses of the theory , while in refs.@xcite these values are quite high and difficult to associate to some physical scale . </S>",
    "<S> this is why our calculation can only be considered as an upper limit on the pion transition form factor . if we had assumed a larger @xmath95 value we would have a better agreement with the babar data </S>",
    "<S> of course , radiative corrections may also bring down the red curve in fig.([fig2 ] ) implying a better adjust of the data . </S>",
    "<S> hence our result provides a field theoretical limit on the pion da and transition form factor based on the hardest asymptotic quark self - energy allowed in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtained a limit on the second moment of the pion da compatible with the one of recent qcd lattice simulation . </S>"
