    ".2 cm    in traditional analytic approach to classical geometry , coordinates are introduced to represent points in the geometric space , and equations of the coordinates are used to define constraints among the points , forming a representation of higher dimensional objects such as curves , surfaces , etc .",

    "advanced invariants_.    although the multiplication of invariants are commutative , the basic invariants generated by generic vector variables of the linear space are not independent , and there are polynomial relations among them , called _ syzygy _ relations . the dependency is largely caused by the dimension constraint of the linear space upon vectors . while the dimension constraint can be easily reflected by the number of coordinates introduced to represent a point and the independency among the coordinates , for basic invariants generated by the points , fully representing the dimension constraint is by no means trivial .",

    "the idea is to convert polynomials of basic invariants into advanced invariants , converse to the approach of classical invariant theory , by means of an associative and multilinear product among the vector variables representing points .",
    "the associativity of the product and the symmetries within a long bracket provide powerful manipulations that can not be done with basic invariants , nor with coordinates .",
