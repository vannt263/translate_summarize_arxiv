    "for more than a decade , the system of the @xmath5 decays is an outstanding topic in heavy - flavour physics ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to the @xmath10 factories , we could obtain valuable insights into these decays , raising the possibility of having a modified electroweak ( ew ) penguin sector through the impact of new physics ( np ) .",
    "the following discussion follows closely the strategy developed in @xcite , and explores the picture after the experimental updates that were reported in the summer of 2006 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding working assumptions for the treatment of the hadronic sector can be summarised as follows :    * @xmath11 flavour symmetry : however , @xmath11-breaking corrections are included through ratios of decay constants and form factors whenever they arise , and the sensitivity of the numerical results on non - factorizable @xmath11-breaking effects is explored .",
    "* neglect of the penguin annihilation and exchange topologies : these contributions can be probed and controlled through the @xmath12 , @xmath13 system , which can be fully exploited at lhcb .",
    "all consistency checks which can be performed with the current data support these working assumptions and do not indicate any anomalous behaviour . concerning the treatment of np , we assume  although we are basically performing a standard - model ( sm ) analysis  that it manifests itself only in the electroweak ( ew ) penguin sector .",
    "such a kind of physics beyond the sm can be accommodated , e.g. , in susy , and models with extra @xmath14 bosons and extra dimension scenarios .",
    "the topic of having np in the ew penguin sector of @xmath5 decays has received a lot of attention in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the following discussion @xcite",
    ", we use the notation @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the  direct \" and  mixing - induced \" cp - violating observables , respectively @xcite ; a sign convention similar to that of ( [ acp - timedep ] ) will also be used for self - tagging @xmath18 and charged @xmath10 decays .",
    "we have seen interesting progress in the exploration of cp violation in @xmath20 . in the sm , the decay amplitude of this decay can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath21,\\ ] ] where the @xmath22 amplitude is governed by the colour - allowed tree topologies , and the cp - conserving hadronic parameter @xmath23 describes , sloppily speaking , the ratio of penguin to tree contributions .",
    "there is now  for the first time  a nice agreement between the babar and belle measurements of the mixing - induced cp asymmetry : @xmath24 which yields the average of @xmath25 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the picture of direct cp violation is still _ not _ settled : @xmath26    this unsatisfactory situation can be resolved with the help of the @xmath1 mode , which is governed by qcd penguin contributions ( this feature holds for all @xmath5 decays ) .",
    "direct cp violation in this channel is now experimentally well established , with a nice agreement between the babar , belle and cdf results , yielding an average of @xmath27 @xcite . in the sm",
    ", the @xmath1 decay amplitude can be written as follows : @xmath28.\\ ] ] using the @xmath11 flavour symmetry and the dynamical assumptions specified in section  [ sec : intro ] , we obtain @xmath29 with @xmath30 , implying the relation @xcite : @xmath31}\\nonumber\\\\ & & = -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\left[\\frac{{\\cal a}_{\\rm cp}^{\\rm dir}(b_d\\to\\pi^\\mp   k^\\pm)}{{\\cal a}_{\\rm cp}^{\\rm dir}(b_d\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-)}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the cp - averaged branching ratios and the direct cp asymmetry @xmath32 are well measured , we may use this relation to _ predict _ the following value : @xmath33 which favours the babar result in ( [ acp - dir - pipi - ex ] ) .",
    "since we can express @xmath34 , @xmath32 and @xmath35 in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , these parameters can be extracted from the data : @xmath39 the value of @xmath36 is in agreement with the sm fits of the unitarity triangle , and will be used for the remainder of this analysis .    applying the isospin symmetry",
    ", we may write @xmath40\\\\",
    "\\sqrt{2}a(b^+\\to\\pi^+\\pi^0)&=&-|\\tilde t|e^{i\\delta_{\\tilde t}}e^{i\\gamma } \\left[1+xe^{i\\delta}\\right ] , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the hadronic parameter @xmath41 denotes the ratio of  colour - suppressed \" to `` colour - allowed tree '' amplitudes .",
    "the experimental values of the ratios of the cp - averaged @xmath19 branching ratios allow an extraction of this quantity , with the following result : @xmath42 complementing these numbers with those in ( [ gam - d - theta ] ) , the following _ predictions _ can be made in the sm : @xmath43 which offer the exciting perspective of observing _",
    "cp violation in the @xmath44 channel .",
    "so far , only data for the direct cp asymmetry are available from the babar and belle collaborations , with the average of @xmath45 , which is  note the signs  in remarkable agreement with ( [ acpdir00 ] ) , giving us further confidence in our analysis .",
    "the @xmath5 decays are dominated by qcd penguin topologies , and can be divided into two classes , depending on the impact of ew penguins :    * the ew penguins are colour - suppressed , leading to tiny contributions : @xmath1 , @xmath46 . *",
    "the ew penguins are colour - allowed , leading to sizeable effects : @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "let us first have a closer look at the @xmath5 observables with a tiny impact of the ew penguins . for the determination of @xmath36 discussed above , we have already used the cp - averaged branching ratio and the direct cp asymmetry of @xmath49 , yielding a value of @xmath36 in excellent agreement with the sm fits of the unitarity triangle .",
    "another decay with colour - suppressed ew penguins is at our disposal , with the following amplitude : @xmath50,\\ ] ] where the doubly cabibbo - suppressed parameter @xmath51 is usually neglected , implying vanishing direct cp violation .",
    "this feature is nicely supported by the experimental average @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "finally , the working assumptions specified in section  [ sec : intro ] allow us to predict the following ratio : @xmath53\\frac{\\tau_{b^+}}{\\tau_{b^0_d}}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\stackrel{\\rm sm}{=}0.942\\pm0.012   \\stackrel{\\rm exp}{=}0.93\\pm0.05.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , we obtain an excellent agreement with the sm , and no anomalous value of @xmath54 is indicated , follows also from @xmath55 decays @xcite . ] thereby ruling out toy models of final - state interaction effects that were discussed several years ago .",
    "the strategy developed in @xcite allows also the prediction of the observables of the @xmath56 decay , where the impact of ew penguins is tiny ( colour - suppressed ) as well . in the sm ,",
    "the corresponding cp asymmetries are predicted as follows : @xmath57 in contrast to the cp asymmetries , an @xmath11-breaking form - factor ratio enters the prediction of the cp - averaged branching ratio . using the result of a recent qcd sum - rule calculation @xcite yields @xmath58}\\\\ ( 28.1_{-5.1}^{+7.0})\\times 10^{-6 } & \\mbox{[$b\\to\\pi k$ ] . } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] as indicated , there are two options for the prediction of this branching ratio , using either @xmath19 or @xmath5 data , which are in remarkable agreement with each other .",
    "the @xmath56 channel has recently been observed at cdf , with the following branching ratio @xcite : @xmath59 within the uncertainties , ( [ bskk - br ] ) is in nice agreement with ( [ bskk - exp ] ) , which is another support of the assumptions listed in section  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "the @xmath56 , @xmath60 system offers a powerful @xmath61-spin strategy for the extraction of @xmath36 at lhcb @xcite ; the predictions and hadronic parameters given above are useful for further experimental studies to prepare the real data taking at the lhc .",
    "the following ratios are key quantities for an analysis of the @xmath5 system : @xmath62 \\stackrel{\\rm exp}{=}1.11\\pm0.07\\\\ r_{\\rm n}&\\equiv & \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\frac{\\mbox{br}(b_d\\to\\pi^\\mp k^\\pm)}{\\mbox{br}(b_d\\to\\pi^0k^0)}\\right ] \\stackrel{\\rm exp}{=}0.99\\pm0.07.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ew penguins , which provide an interesting avenue for np to manifest itself @xcite , enter here in colour - allowed form through the modes involving neutral pions , and are theoretically described by two parameters : @xmath63 , which measures the  strength \" of the ew penguin with respect to the tree contributions , and a cp - violating phase @xmath64 . in the sm",
    ", the @xmath11 flavour symmetry allows a prediction of @xmath65 @xcite , and @xmath64 _ vanishes .",
    "_     the time evolution of the experimental values of @xmath6.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    if we look at fig .",
    "[ fig : timeline ] showing the time evolution of the experimental values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we observe that the central values have significantly moved up ( partly due to radiative corrections affecting final states with charged particles @xcite ) , while the errors were only marginally reduced . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rnrc ] , we show the situation in the plane of the observables @xmath67 and @xmath66 : the contours correspond to different values of @xmath63 , and are parametrized through the phase @xmath64 . we see that the sm prediction ( on the right - hand side ) is very stable in time , having now significantly reduced errors . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath10-factory data have moved quite a bit towards the sm . converting the experimental values of @xmath67 and @xmath66 into @xmath63 and @xmath64 yields @xmath68 a similar trend  see , in particular , the time evolution of @xmath69  is also present in the analysis of cp violation in @xmath70 penguin - dominated decays @xcite .",

    "[ fig : acp ] , sm predictions for the cp - violating observables of @xmath7 are obtained that are much sharper than the current @xmath10-factory data .",
    "in particular @xmath71 offers a very interesting quantitiy .",
    "we also see that the experimental central values can be reached for large _ positive _ values of @xmath64 . concerning direct cp violation in @xmath8 ,",
    "the following sm prediction arises : @xmath74 which is in good agreement with the experimental result @xmath75 within the errors . for the new input data , this feature turns interestingly out to be almost independent of np .",
    "consequently , the non - vanishing experimental value of @xmath76 which differs from zero at the @xmath77 level , is likely to be generated through hadronic effects , i.e.  not through the presence of np .",
    "performing , finally , a fit to @xmath67 , @xmath66 and the cp asymmetries of @xmath7 yields @xmath78 interestingly , these parameters  in particular the large _ positive _ phase  would also allow us to accommodate the experimental values of @xmath69 and the cp asymmetries of other @xmath70 penguin modes with central values smaller than @xmath79",
    ". the large value of @xmath63 would be excluded by constraints from rare decays in simple scenarios where np enters only through @xmath80 penguins @xcite , but could still be accommodated in other scenarios , e.g.  in models with leptophobic @xmath14 bosons .",
    "the strategy developed in @xcite continues to provide a powerful tool for the theoretical interpretation of the @xmath81 data @xcite .",
    "thanks to the progress at the @xmath10 factories , now only data could be used where the babar and belle collaborations are in full agreement with each other .",
    "however , the corresponding sm predictions are very stable , with almost unchanged central values since the original analysis of 2003 , and significantly reduced errors .    using the braching ratio and direct cp asymmetry of the @xmath1 channel , the picture of direct cp violation in @xmath20 could be clarified , with the prediction of @xmath3 , which favours the babar result , and the extraction of @xmath4 , which is in agreement with the sm fits of the unitarity triangle .      *",
    "all modes with colour - suppressed ew penguins are in excellent agreement with the sm . *",
    "the data for the @xmath82 have moved quite a bit towards the sm predictions , which are almost unchanged , thereby reducing the  @xmath5 puzzle \" for the cp - averaged branching ratios . *",
    "the non - zero experimental value of @xmath83 seems to be caused by hadronic and not by np effects .",
    "* on the other hand , the mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath7 still looks puzzling , and can straightforwardly be accommodated through a modified ew penguin sector with a large , positive value of the cp - violating np phase @xmath64 .",
    "unfortunately , we still can not draw definite conclusions about the presence of np in the @xmath5 system ( and other @xmath70 penguin decays , such as @xmath84 )",
