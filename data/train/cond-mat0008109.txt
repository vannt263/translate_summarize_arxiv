    "we have shown in our previous article @xcite that thermodynamical fluctuations of temperature in mirrors ( test masses ) of ligo - type gravitational wave antenna @xcite are transformed due to the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath0 into additional ( thermoelastic ) noise which may be a serious `` barrier '' limiting sensitivity .",
    "this noise is caused in fact by random fluctuations of the coordinate averaged over the mirror s surface .",
    "the spectral density of this random coordinate displacement may be presented for infinite test mass in the following form : ) . ]",
    "@xmath1 here @xmath2 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath3 is temperature , @xmath4 is poison ratio , @xmath5 is thermal conductivity , @xmath6 is density and @xmath7 is specific heat capacity , @xmath8 is the radius of the spot of laser beam over which the averaging of the fluctuations is performed .",
    "this noise is of nonlinear origin as the nonzero value of @xmath9 is due to the anharmonisity of the lattice .",
    "the goal of this article is to present the results of the analysis of another additional ( and also of nonlinear origin ) effect which may be comparable with other known noise mechanisms limiting the sensitivity . qualitatively this effect is may be understood in the following way .",
    "the laser beam `` extracts '' the information not only about the change of the length of the antenna produced by gravitational wave but also about the fluctuations of position of mirrors surfaces averaged over the beam spot .",
    "these fluctuations lead to phase noise in the reflected optical field .",
    "however the phase noise may be produced by another effect .",
    "high reflectivity of the mirrors is provided by multilayer coatings which consist of alternating sequences of quarter - wavelength dielectric layers having refraction indices @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the most frequently used pairs of layers are @xmath12 and @xmath13 . while reflecting the optical wave `` penetrates '' in the coating on certain depth .",
    "this depth is of the order of the optical thickness of one pair of layers @xmath14 .",
    "if the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 depend on temperature @xmath3 ( thermo - refractive factor @xmath15 is nonzero ) then thermodynamical fluctuations of temperature lead to fluctuations of optical thickness of these layers and hence to the phase noise in the reflected wave .",
    "though the thickness @xmath16 of the working layer is small , the coefficient @xmath17 is usually significantly larger than @xmath9 ( both have the same dimensions ) . for fused silica ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( i.e. 30 times larger than @xmath9 ) .",
    "this phase noise may be evidently easily recalculated in terms of equivalent fluctuations of the surface and consequently compared with the spectral sensitivity of the antenna .",
    "we have analyzed also the photo - thermal refractive shot noise : due to random absorption of optical photons , the random fluctuations of temperature in the surface layer of the mirror take place , producing fluctuations of refractive indices of the coating and therefore phase fluctuations of reflected light wave ( this effect is similar to photo - thermal shot noise , analyzed in @xcite ) .",
    "however , this effect is numerically much smaller than thermo - refractive noise  that is why we do not present here the detailed analysis of it .",
    "the theory of reflection of light from multilayer dielectrical coating is well known ( see for example @xcite ) . using traditional approach",
    "we may recalculate the phase shift @xmath21 into equivalent displacement @xmath22 of mirror ( see appendix [ a ] ) : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the fluctuation of averaged temperature , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "it is important to note , that effective coating thickness is much smaller than the characteristic length of diffusive heat transfer : @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is temperature conductivity , @xmath29 is the frequency of observation which is of order @xmath30 for laser gravitational wave antenna ) .",
    "therefore we may consider in our calculations that fluctuations of temperature are correlated in the layers .    to calculate thermodynamical fluctuations of temperature @xmath31 in the surface layers we use langevin approach and introduce fluctuational thermal sources",
    "@xmath32 added to the right part of the equation of thermal conductivity : @xmath33    this approach was described and verified in @xcite ( see all the details over there ) .",
    "as in @xcite we replace the mirror by half - space : @xmath34 with the boundary condition of thermo - isolation on surface @xmath35 .",
    "we may now calculate the spectrum of temperature fluctuations : @xmath36.\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the thermodynamical fluctuations of temperature @xmath24 averaged over the volume @xmath37 may be presented in the following form : @xmath38    from this expression and from ( [ corrfk ] ) we find immediately the spectral density @xmath39 of fluctuations of the averaged temperature : @xmath40 here @xmath41 .",
    "the first term @xmath42 appears because as in @xcite we use `` one - sided '' spectral density , defined only for positive frequencies , which is connected with the correlation function @xmath43 by the formula @xmath44 the term @xmath45 appears due to two @xmath46-functions in square brackets in ( [ corrfk ] ) .",
    "for the frequency of observation @xmath47 characteristic length @xmath48 ( we used for the estimates constants for fused silica ) , so that @xmath49 . taking into account that @xmath50 we may consider the first denominator as constant while integrating over @xmath51 . in the same way @xmath52 and while integrating over @xmath53 we may consider the second denominator as unity .",
    "it is interesting that in this model the spectral density @xmath39 does not depend on @xmath16 .",
    "this spectral density may be recalculated to the spectral density of equivalent fluctuations of surface displacement to compare it with other known sources of noise : @xmath54",
    "for the numerical estimates we assumed that the multilayer coating consists from alternating pairs of layers : @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath57 ) , or @xmath58 ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath57 ) . the values of @xmath17 for @xmath55 and for @xmath58 were found in @xcite .",
    "we want now to compare the thermo - refractive fluctuations with thermoelastic noise ( [ tespot ] ) and noise associated with the mirrors material losses described in the model of structural damping@xcite ( we denote it as brownian motion of the surface ) . in this model",
    "the angle of losses @xmath59 does not depend on frequency and for its spectral density the following formula is valid for infinite test mass @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is young modulus , and @xmath4 is poison ratio .    the spectrsal sensitivity of gravitational wave antenna to the perturbation of metric @xmath62 may be recalculated from noise spectral density of displacement @xmath63 using the following formula : @xmath64 where we used the fact that antenna has two arms ( with length @xmath65 ) with two mirrors the fluctuations on which are averaged over the radii @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the ligo - ii antenna will approach the level of sql , so we also compare the noise limited sensitivity to this limit in spectral form @xcite : @xmath68    for the calculations we used the set of parameters given in appendix [ b ] ( the same as in @xcite ) plus @xcite @xmath69 we used figures from @xcite for ion plating method only , for other methods of deposition the value of @xmath17 may be two times larger . in figure 1 we plot all previously known noises @xcite together with the new one .",
    "we see that thermorefractive noise limitation is close to sql for the frequences near @xmath70  hz .",
    "summing up , we may say that thermo - refractive effect is not small and it must be seriously considered in interferometric gravitational antennae ( projects ligo - ii and especially ligo - iii , where overcomming of the sql is planned ) .",
    "it is also important that this effect depends slower on the radii of the beam - spots than thermo - elastic noise and thus may become dominating for larger @xmath8 planned in ligo - ii and ligo - iii .",
    "this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant no .",
    "phy9800097 , the russian foundation for basic research grant # 96 - 15 - 96780 , and the russian ministry of science and technology .",
    "[ [ a ] ]    in this appendix we give the calculation of coefficient of reflection of light wave from multilayer coatings consisting of infinite sequences of pairs of quarter - wavelength dielectrical layers @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "let the refraction index of odd layers fluctuates on @xmath71 and the refraction index of even layers on @xmath72 .",
    "one may reformulate this problem into the problem for distributed long line @xcite .",
    "the equivalent impedance @xmath73 of this system of layers may be deduced using the following statement : the addition of two layers does not change the value of @xmath73 .",
    "voltage @xmath74 and current @xmath75 at the end of second layer may be found from input voltage @xmath76 and current @xmath77 using transformation matrix @xmath78 ( @xcite , formula ( 3.9.27 ) ) : @xmath79 here we take into account that for quarter - wavelength layers @xmath80 and therefore one may use approximation @xmath81 .",
    "now we put that @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 is generalized conductivity of the sequence of layers ) and obtain two equations : @xmath85 solving these equations we find conductivity @xmath86 and reflection coefficient @xmath87 : @xmath88 from this point it is easy to obtain ( [ deltax],[betaeff ] ) , assuming @xmath89",
