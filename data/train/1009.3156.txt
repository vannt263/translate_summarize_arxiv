    "bacteria have sophisticated signal transduction and gene regulatory networks for rapid adaptation to environmental changes . in recent years",
    "it became increasingly recognized , that the dynamical response of these biochemical reaction networks is subject to significant stochastic fluctuations @xcite , which can lead to heterogeneous behavior across cellular populations .",
    "examples include the transient differentiation of _ b. subtilis _ in its late exponential phase @xcite , bacterial persistence in _ e. coli _",
    "@xcite , and the mating pheromone response pathway in yeast @xcite . in many of these systems ,",
    "positive feedback plays a fundamental role , since it gives rise to bistability and thereby causes two clearly distinct gene expression states @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that biochemical noise induces stochastic transitions between the two `` stable '' states , and it was suggested that the resulting population heterogeneity provides selective advantages for colony growth in fluctuating environments @xcite",
    ".    regulatory network of the native arabinose utilization system @xcite , including the _ gfp_-reporter module used in this study .",
    "the system consists of genes for arabinose uptake ( _ arae , arafgh _ ) , genes for arabinose metabolism ( _ arabad _ ) , and the regulator arac .",
    "high amounts of intracellular arabinose activate arac , which stimulates expression from the promoters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in the absence of arabinose ,",
    "arac represses expression from @xmath0 ( not depicted ) .",
    "note that we also omitted the less pronounced negative autoregulation of arac in the absence and presence of arabinose @xcite , since this feedback mainly seems to provide a constant transcription factor abundance @xcite . as indicated in light grey , in the mutant used in this study the chromosomal",
    "_ arabad _ operon is deleted , and hence the additional negative feedback on internal arabinose is avoided . as a reporter for the expression of the ara system we used a",
    "plasmid - borne _ gfp _ variant under the control of the @xmath0 promoter , see materials and methods for details.,width=321 ]    a prototypic class of positive feedback systems are the inducible sugar utilization systems , in which bistability is caused by the autocatalytic positive feedback of the sugar on its own uptake proteins .",
    "these systems allow bacteria to grow on less favorable carbon sources than glucose : for instance , in a medium where lactose is the only energy source , _ e. coli _ s lactose utilization ( _ lac _ ) system either imports and catabolizes lactose at a high rate ( on state ) , or it does not use lactose at all ( off state ) @xcite .",
    "this bistable behavior has drastic effects on the behavior at the population level .",
    "when a high amount of external lactose was added to a previously uninduced culture , all cells in the population switched from the off to the on state . however , at lower sugar concentrations only a fraction of cells switched to the on state while others remained in the off state @xcite .    here , we are interested in the dynamics of such a switching process on the single cell level .",
    "we study these dynamics in the context of the arabinose utilization ( _ ara _ ) system of _",
    "@xcite , another well - characterized bistable system , see fig .",
    "[ figmodel ] . in this case",
    ", arabinose is imported by the high - affinity low - capacity transporter arafgh and the low - affinity high - capacity transporter arae .",
    "if internal arabinose exceeds a threshold concentration , it activates arac , which in turn promotes expression of _ arafgh _ , _ arae _ and the genes for arabinose catabolism _ arabad_. siegele and hu @xcite analyzed population distributions at intermediate sugar levels , and revealed that the _ ara _ system displays an all - or - nothing expression pattern similar to the _ lac _ system .",
    "they conjectured that in uninduced cells the stochastic background expression of the _ ara _ regulon leads to a wide distribution of _ ara _ uptake proteins .",
    "addition of arabinose would then lead to different rates of arabinose accumulation , causing heterogeneous timing of gene induction within the population . at a given time",
    "there would be a fraction of induced and a fraction of uninduced cells , and the depletion of arabinose by the metabolism of the induced cells could explain the fixation of the all - or - nothing response .",
    "this conjecture is consistent with a computational study of autocatalytic expression systems @xcite and experiments which placed _ arae _ under the control of a constitutive promoter , finding homogeneous gene expression in the population @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of switching processes has also been studied using flow cytometry techniques , which yield a time series of population distributions of gene expression levels @xcite .    in this study",
    "we take a different experimental approach : rather than recording population distributions , we use quantitative time - lapse fluorescence microscopy to follow the expression dynamics of the switching process in many cells , individually . in a physics analogy , this is akin to following the trajectories of many particles , instead of recording their spatial density distribution at different time points .",
    "clearly , the distributions can be obtained from the trajectories , but not vice versa , i.e. the trajectories contain more information . in the present case ,",
    "this additional information is particularly useful to disentangle different variables that affect the response of individual cells : the observed time - dependent fluorescence level is the final output of a series of biochemical processes , which can be grouped into two connected subsystems , an `` uptake module '' and a `` reporter module '' .",
    "both modules experience noise , which , to a first approximation , can be subsumed into a single parameter for each module . as we will see , one can extract these two parameters for each cell by fitting an appropriate model to the `` fluorescence trajectory '' of the cell . as a result",
    ", we can directly obtain the separate distributions for these two parameters , and even measure their correlations . note",
    "that this analysis would not have been possible based on population distributions of gene expression levels .    using this approach",
    ", we address the question raised by siegele and hu @xcite , i.e. is the all - or - nothing response of the _ ara _ system associated with heterogeneous timing of gene induction , and , if so , is the heterogeneous timing causally related to a wide distribution of _ ara _ uptake proteins ? at subsaturating sugar levels , we observe a significant delay between addition of inducer and increase of fluorescence , which is indeed broadly distributed . to clarify the origin of this delay and its broad distribution , it is necessary to separate the intrinsic lag of the gfp expression dynamics from the time - lag inherent to the stochastic arabinose uptake . to this end , we leverage our microfluidic setup to separately measure the distribution of gfp maturation times across an _ e. coli _ population .",
    "we also record the cell - to - cell variation of the growth rates . using a simple quantitative model for the expression dynamics",
    ", we then extract the intrinsic timing statistics for gene induction .",
    "we find that this distribution is well described by an analytical delay time distribution derived from a stochastic model for the uptake module .",

    "<S> the arabinose utilization system of _ e. coli _ displays a stochastic `` all or nothing '' response at intermediate levels of arabinose , where the population divides into a fraction catabolizing the sugar at a high rate ( on state ) and a fraction not utilizing arabinose ( off state ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we study this decision process in individual cells , focusing on the dynamics of the transition from the off to the on state . using quantitative time - lapse microscopy </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the time delay between inducer addition and fluorescence onset of a gfp reporter . through independent characterization of the gfp maturation process , we can separate the lag time caused by the reporter from the intrinsic activation time of the arabinose system . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting distribution of intrinsic time delays scales inversely with the external arabinose concentration , and is compatible with a simple stochastic model for arabinose uptake . </S>",
    "<S> our findings support the idea that the heterogeneous timing of gene induction is causally related to a broad distribution of uptake proteins at the time of sugar addition .    _ </S>",
