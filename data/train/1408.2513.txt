    "globally propagating disturbances in the solar corona have been first reported by and in images recorded by the extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ; ) aboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _",
    "( soho ; ) spacecraft , thereafter called ` eit waves ' , or more generally , ` euv waves ' or ` large - scale coronal waves ' .",
    "so far a hand full of statistical studies exist on large - scale coronal waves .",
    "analyzed 19 euv waves reporting propagation speeds in the range of 170  350  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "comparable results were obtained by who studied 176 events that occurred in the solar minimum period from march 1997 to june 1998 with typical velocities of 200400  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "they also tried to solve the question of the physical origin of euv waves by examining the association rates to cmes , flares and type ii bursts .",
    "an unambiguous association of euv waves with cmes was found , significantly stronger than the association with flares and type ii bursts ( see also ; ) .",
    "the detection of fast euv waves may have been hampered by the time cadence of the eit instrument ( @xmath9  min ) .",
    "these limitations were overcome by the launch of the _ stereo ( solar - terrestrial relations observatory _ ; ) twin spacecraft in 2006 with its _ extreme ultraviolet imager _",
    "( euvi ; ) .",
    "the identically built instruments ( euvi - a and euvi - b ) observe the solar corona in four different euv passbands with a cadence as high as 75  s and a large field of view ( fov ; up to 1.7  _ _ r__@xmath10 ) from two different vantage points .",
    "the first statistical study using euvi observations was presented by .",
    "these authors studied the kinematics of a set of 17 stereo / euvi and 61 soho / eit wave observations , concluding that there are three different classes of euv waves .",
    "class 1 events are characterized by speeds higher than @xmath11  km  s@xmath1 and show deceleration during propagation .",
    "the deceleration is stronger in fast than in slow euv waves , consistent with the nonlinear evolution of large - amplitude waves or shocks .",
    "class 2 events propagate with almost constant speeds in the range 170  320  km  s@xmath1 ( which is comparable to the local fast - mode speed in the solar corona ) and can be interpreted as linear small - amplitude waves",
    ". the events of class 3 have velocities which are smaller than the coronal sound speed , and can thus not be integrated into the fast - mode wave interpretation .",
    "they may be either a result of magnetic reconfiguration @xcite or slow - mode waves @xcite .",
    "further improvements on the observations of euv waves came with the launch of the _ solar dynamics observatory _",
    "( sdo ; ) satellite in 2010 .",
    "one of the instruments onboard sdo is the _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( aia ; ) that provides high - cadence ( up to 12  s ) euv imagery with high sensitivity over a broad temperature range .",
    "conducted a first aia - based statistical study which consisted of 138 euv wave events that occurred during april 2010 to january 2013 .",
    "these authors studied the early propagation phase of the euv waves in different propagation directions . for each event , the direction of the highest velocity was determined , giving a sample mean of @xmath12  km  s@xmath1 , considerably higher than former wave studies using eit or euvi observations .",
    "in contrast to the study , found neither a correlation between the wave velocity and acceleration nor an evidence for a multi - class population of large - scale waves .",
    "two different interpretations for euv waves are discussed , wave and non - wave models .",
    "the wave model interprets the euv transient as fast - mode mhd wave initiated either by the associated cme , flare or small scale ejecta @xcite .",
    "the wave model is supported by a variety of different observational findings : reflection , refraction and transmission of euv waves across the boundaries of coronal holes or active regions @xcite , the pulse broadening and amplitude decrease @xcite , the downward plasma motions observed at the wave front @xcite , the occurrence of homologous euv waves showing a correlation between the wave speed and its amplitude @xcite as well as the observations of multiple pulses @xcite .",
    "recent studies based on observations from sdo / aia by , and address also the wave nature of the euv transient . in addition to the typical wave - like properties they observe the formation of secondary waves at active region boundaries and/or the separation of the diffuse wave signature from the driving cme at the end of the cme acceleration phase .    in the non - wave model ,",
    "euv wave signatures are interpreted as coronal ground track of successively opening and restructuring magnetic field lines caused by the expanding cme @xcite .",
    "the observations of stationary wave fronts and the rotation of wave fronts @xcite are in support of the non - wave model .",
    "this debate about the nature of the events resulted in a combination of the wave and the non - wave model , first suggested by .",
    "mhd simulations by and indeed revealed both wave as well as non - wave characteristics .",
    "the high cadence aia imagery provided for the first time observations of simultaneously launched fast and slow euv transients and support the combined wave / non - wave model @xcite .",
    "for further discussions we refer to recent reviews by , , , and .    in this paper , we present a statistical analysis of euv waves observed by stereo / euvi .",
    "the 60 euv wave events under study occurred during january 2007 to february 2011 which corresponds to the transition between the declining phase of solar cycle 23 and the rising phase of solar cycle 24 , including the extreme solar minimum .",
    "this time range has two advantages : a ) on average there is a small number of active regions which disturb the propagation of the euv events under study ; b ) the downlink rate of the two stereo spacecraft was still high enough to provide data at high cadence .",
    "the disadvantage , however , is that there is only a small number of strong euv wave events included in the study , which occur preferentially during times of high solar activity .",
    "we study the kinematics ( velocity and acceleration ) and wave pulse characteristics ( amplitude , impulsiveness ) of the events as well as their association rates to cmes , flares and type ii bursts .",
    "seven of the 60 events were observed by both stereo spacecraft and can thus be compared to study the differences in the obtained kinematics due to the observations from different vantage points .",
    "a description of the data is given in section  [ sec : datadescription ] and the analysis technique in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the statistical results on the wave kinematics and the wave pulse characteristics conducted by the semi - automated perturbation profile method are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "a discussion and conclusion on the results is given in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in the appendix of this paper we compare the results of kinematical analysis of a representative sub - sample based on the visual tracking method _ vs. _ perturbation profiles .",
    "the euvi instruments are part of the _ sun earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation _ ( secchi ; ) instrument suite on board the stereo - a ( ahead ; st - a ) and stereo - b ( behind ; st - b ) spacecraft ( s / c ) . the steady separation of st - a and st - b is 45@xmath13 per year .",
    "euvi observes the chromosphere and low corona in four spectral channels ( 304@xmath14 : dominant emission from he  ii ion , t@xmath15 0.07 mk ; 171@xmath14 : fe  ix , t@xmath15 1  mk ; 195@xmath14 : fe  xii ,",

    "euv waves are best observed in the 195@xmath14 channel . in the data set under study , the euvi 195  @xmath14 cadence was 2.5  min in 13 events , 5  min in 35 events , and 10  min in 12 events .",
    "the statistical analysis started with a manual inspection of the euvi data set in the 195  @xmath14 passband to select suitable events . to this aim ,",
    "an online euv event catalogue was established@xmath17 . in this catalogue",
    "the identified euv waves were classified and collected in event lists for both euvi instruments . for each event",
    "the date , start time , center position in the euvi - a and euvi - b field of view ( fov ) , and a ( subjective ) three - scale classification ( 1 : weak , 2 : moderate , 3 : strong ) are given . events of class 1 are weak in intensity and can only be observed for distances up to @xmath1580  mm from the source region ( comparable to the ` mini cmes ' reported in ) .",
    "class 2 events are moderate in their intensity enhancement and can be observed over a maximum distance range up to @xmath15400 mm .",
    "class 3 events are strong in intensity and propagate over the whole solar disk .    during the time period from january 2007 to february 2011",
    "more than 1000 euv transients were identified in the stereo / euvi data .",
    "the number of events belonging to the three different classes is as follows : class 1 @xmath15 800 events , class 2 @xmath15 150 events , and class 3 @xmath15 50 events which means that the overall occurrence rate for class 1 events is 80% , for class 2 events it is 15% and for class 3 events it is 5% .",
    "we excluded all events with importance class 1 and faint class 2 events as well as those events having the wave center located behind the visible solar disk or very close to the solar limb ( corresponding to events located within 75@xmath13 up to 90@xmath13 from the central meridian ) in order to avoid large errors in the wave kinematics due to projection effects . in summary ,",
    "a total of 60 different euv wave events ( most of them is of class 3 and some events are from class 2 ) is analyzed ( 36 in st - a and 31 in st - b ) .",
    "8 events were observed and analyzed in both stereo s / c .    for the events under study we determined the cme , flare and type ii burst association rate by using several event catalogues .",
    "the cme survey is based on stereo / euvi / cor data and the lasco / cme catalogue@xmath18 .",
    "the flare survey is based on the goes catalogue@xmath19 . for the type ii",
    "burst survey we distinguished between coronal and interplanetary type ii bursts .",
    "the information on coronal type ii bursts is extracted from a catalogue which collects information from a network of 21 ground - based stations @xmath20 .",
    "the information on interplanetary type ii bursts is extracted from the swaves ( stereo / waves@xmath21 onboard stereo ; ) catalogue .",
    "for all events under study the euvi filtergrams were reduced using the secchi@xmath22prep routines available within solarsoft .",
    "we differentially rotated each data set to a common reference time . in order to enhance faint signatures , we derived base - ratio ( br ) images by dividing each direct image by a pre - event image .",
    "thus , we derive for each pixel of the image the relative change of intensity with respect to the pre - event state .",
    "finally , a median filter was applied to the images to remove small scale variations .    the kinematical analysis of large - scale disturbances is often based on visual tracking of the outer edge of the wave front .",
    "an alternative is the semi - automated perturbation profile method @xcite , which we also use in this study .",
    "the advantages of the perturbation profile method are that it gives insight into important physical parameters of euv waves , _",
    "e.g. _ amplitude , and that it is observer independent @xcite .",
    "nevertheless there are also disadvantages , like the usage of br images as they highly rely on the preevent images .",
    "the problem of br images is that the base level varies with the spatial position and thus , each position is normalized by a different value .",
    "we try to minimize this effect by using a preevent image of the quiet solar corona . on the one hand quantities in physics",
    "are defined as the net change and thus , base difference images ( bd ) would better account for this purpose . on the other hand the usage of bd images leads to similar problems as mentioned above using br images and additionally , from br images the relative change ( in % ) can be used for further characteristics , _",
    "e.g. _ the mach number of the event can be determined @xcite . in this sense , neither br nor bd images may be better than the other , and either of them is simply a proxy of the perturbation that we observe . thus this algorithm has its limitations .",
    "the perturbation profile algorithm needs some manual input @xcite : a ) the center of the eruption , and b ) the propagation direction under study ( which can be chosen by the observer ) .",
    "the center was determined by drawing the earliest observed euv wave front , transforming the heliocentric coordinates to heliographic coordinates and applying a circular fit to the measurements .",
    "the center of this circle is then re - transformed to heliocentric coordinates .",
    "we calculate the kinematics of the wave fronts along great circles on the solar surface , studying the propagation in a sector of 45@xmath13 width , in which the wave is most pronounced .",
    "perturbation profiles are obtained by deriving the mean values of all pixels between two constantly growing concentric circles defining annuli with a radial width of 1@xmath13 within the selected propagation sector .    in the perturbation profiles ,",
    "propagating disturbances can be clearly identified as distinct bumps above the background level ( which is 1.0 in base ratio images ) .",
    "modified gaussian envelopes emphasizing the leading part of the wave bump are then fitted to the perturbation profiles . therefore a simple gaussian fit is applied to the first half of the wave bump from the maximum until the leading edge ( shown as bold lines in figures  [ img:20090905a_neu]-[img:20110127a_b_neu ] , [ img:20070516a ] , and [ img:20071207b ] ) .",
    "the trailing part of the wave bump is not used for the gaussian envelope fitting process as it may be affected by , _",
    "e.g. _ enhanced emission from cme flanks , solar flares , stationary brightenings or coronal dimmings behind the euv wave . for presentation purposes ,",
    "the fitted gaussian envelope is mirrored at the position of the peak amplitude ( shown as dashed lines in figures  [ img:20090905a_neu]-[img:20110127a_b_neu ] , [ img:20070516a ] , and [ img:20071207b ] ) . from the gaussian fits",
    ", we extract the peak amplitude of the disturbance as well as the position of the wave front , applying a threshold level of 2% above the background .    for each event under study , we derive time - distance plots of the euv wave front .",
    "linear as well as quadratic least - square fits are applied to the data points . from the linear",
    "fits the mean ( constant ) propagation velocities ( @xmath23 ) are determined , while the quadratic fits are used to obtain the ` start ' velocity ( @xmath24 ) and the acceleration / deceleration of the euv wave during its propagation .",
    "the time of first wave observation is taken as start time .",
    "the velocity derived from the quadratic fit at that instant is used as an estimate of the ` start velocity ' of the euv wave . the fits and the errors on the fitting results",
    "are obtained with the bootstrapping method @xcite . to this aim , we added random errors ( with a maximum of @xmath25  mm ) to the position measurements , fitted the data set , and repeated this procedure a thousand times .",
    "the mean values and the standard deviations are used as the resulting kinematical fit parameters and related errors .",
    "in addition , we gain important information on the wave events by extracting characteristic parameters from the perturbation profiles , _",
    "e.g. _ the perturbation amplitude evolution as well as the peak amplitude @xmath26 .",
    "we also derive the build - up time @xmath27 that is calculated as the time difference between the first observation and the time of the peak amplitude .",
    "the impulsiveness @xmath28 of an event is calculated by dividing the peak amplitude by its build up time , @xmath29 .",
    "an overview of all events under study is given in table  [ tab : table1 ]    [ tab : table4 ] .",
    "for each euv wave event we list the following information : ( 1 ) observation date and start time ; ( 2 ) observing spacecraft ; ( 3 ) mean velocity @xmath23 ; ( 4 ) start velocity @xmath24 ; ( 5 ) acceleration @xmath30 ; ( 6 ) peak amplitude @xmath26 ; ( 7 ) cme association and cme velocity ; ( 8) sxr flare association and classification ; ( 9 ) coronal and/or interplanetary type ii radio burst association .

    "we observe a clear steepening of the perturbation amplitude reaching the peak amplitude @xmath26 5 up to 30 min after the first wave signature is observed .",
    "the mean value for the build - up time @xmath31 for all events under study is determined to be @xmath15 9  min . after the peak amplitude has been reached the wave pulses decay and broaden until the transient can no longer be traced .",
    "the perturbation amplitudes of all events under study follow a characteristic evolution showing a steepening in the beginning , and a decaying and broadening in the end ( see left panels in figures  [ img:20090905a_neu ]  [ img:20110127a_b_neu ] ) .",

    "the distribution shows that most data points are in the negative range ( the arithmetic mean is @xmath40  m  s@xmath5 ) , indicating deceleration of the euv waves during propagation . to quantify the significance , we determined the errors on the acceleration values derived from the quadratic fits using bootstrapping",
    ": for the whole event sample , we obtain an arithmetic mean for the errors of 49  m  s@xmath5 ( median 54  m  s@xmath5 ) . consequently , we attribute all waves which have acceleration values in the range of @xmath41  m  s@xmath5 still as consistent with a propagation of constant speed .",
    "this group comprises 48% of the events , whereas 52% of the euv waves under study show a significant deceleration .    figure  [ img : acceleration](b ) shows the scatter plot of the start velocity @xmath24 against the acceleration @xmath30 .",
    "the black solid line represents the least - square linear fit to the data set revealing a strong anti - correlation with a correlation coefficient of @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the faster the wave initially , the stronger the deceleration during its propagation . to mark the value of zero acceleration we plotted a vertical dashed - dotted line at this position .",
    "the intersection of the least - square linear fit and the zero acceleration line lies at a velocity value of @xmath43  km  s@xmath1 corresponding to the typical fast - mode magnetosonic speed in the quiet solar corona .",
    "thus , events with initial speeds higher than the fast magnetosonic speed decelerate , whereas events with initial speeds close to the magnetosonic speed show constant speed during wave propagation .",

    "a positive correlation of @xmath44 against @xmath26 means that faster events show more pronounced peak amplitudes .",
    "the anti - correlation of @xmath44 against @xmath27 is a result of faster events reaching the peak amplitude in shorter time .",
    "the positive correlation of @xmath44 against @xmath28 implies that faster events are more impulsive as they compress the surrounding plasma within a shorter period .",

    "a recent study by based on high - cadence sdo / aia imagery resulted in a much higher mean velocity of @xmath71  km  s@xmath1 , and revealed no significant correlation between speed and acceleration of the euv waves under study .",
    "a comparison of six events ( marked with a @xmath72 in table  [ tab : table4 ] ) which are analyzed by as well as in our study led to the following findings : for five out of six events the mean velocity was @xmath1530% higher than the mean velocity from our measurements . in one case",
    "the velocities were matching each other well .",
    "in another recent study by the association of solar flares with cmes as well as their association to euv wave events was analyzed . using the same stereo imagery ( from 2007 until 2009 )",
    "they found 34 euv events associated with solar flares .",
    "we took all 15 events ( marked with a @xmath73 in tables  [ tab : table1 ] and [ tab : table2 ] ) which are analyzed by as well as in our study for a comparison of the results . in figure  [ img : nitta1314 ] we display the velocity values obtained by and against ours together with a one - to - one correspondence line ( black dashed line ) .",
    "the correlation coefficient is @xmath74 and the mean velocity difference is @xmath75  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "what can be seen is that the mean velocity values found by and are in 50% of all cases higher than ours .",
    "thus , the mean velocity for these 21 events found by and is @xmath76  km  s@xmath1 while our mean velocity value is @xmath77  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "an explanation for the higher mean velocities obtained in the studies may be that the velocities were derived during the early propagation phase ( until about 1520 min after launch ) .",
    "this rather short observation time leads to higher velocities since the deceleration occurs only in the later stages of the evolution .",
    "additionally , in some cases the propagation sector used for the analysis is different .",
    "thus the velocities may differ due to the non - isotropic behavior of euv waves .",
    "extracted the velocity at the propagation sector where it was highest .",
    "reported for the event of 19 may 2007 that a higher observing cadence in different channels can lead to higher wave velocities . for checking the dependence of the derived results on the time cadence , we plot in figure  [ img : vel_cad ] the mean velocities ( pink filled circle ) and start velocities ( black asterisks ) of all 60 euv wave events under study versus the observing cadence ( either 2.5  min , 5  min , or 10  min ) of each event . the sample average values for both",
    ", the mean velocities ( blue filled circle ) and the start velocities ( green asterisks ) are overplotted for each sub - group .",
    "the arithmetic means for the mean velocities are : @xmath78  km  s@xmath1 ( for 2.5  min ) , @xmath79  km  s@xmath1 ( for 5  min ) , and @xmath80  km  s@xmath1 ( for 10  min ) and for the start velocities are : @xmath81  km  s@xmath1 ( for 2.5  min ) , @xmath82  km  s@xmath1 ( for 5  min ) , and @xmath83  km  s@xmath1 ( for 10  min ) .",
    "thus , there is no trend observable that the difference in the observing cadence ( from 2.5 to 12 min ) causes systematic differences in the euv wave velocities derived .",
    "however , we can not exclude that there is an effect when the cadence is as small as 12  s ( aia ) and the wave velocity is determined in the very early propagation phase of the event , such as done in the study .",
    "we find positive correlations between the velocity and the peak amplitude as well as the impulsiveness of the perturbation which supports the interpretation that the euv waves are pressure pulses that compress the surrounding plasma while propagating .",
    "the anticorrelation between the velocity and the build - up time means that for impulsive events the build - up time is shorter than for gradual events .",
    "thus , the steepening of the peak amplitudes into a shock front depends on the initial velocity and acceleration , which is a typical characteristic of wave - like disturbances @xcite .",
    "the association rates of the events under study to cmes and flares may give hints to the driver of the transients .",
    "for the 60 events under study we find 57 associated cmes giving a 95% association rate .",
    "this association rate is similar to numbers published by .",
    "however , there is only a very weak correlation between the cme velocities and the characteristic parameters of the euv wave ( @xmath84 ) . a loose correlation between cme and euv speeds",
    "is also reported by from a sdo / aia statistical study .",
    "they found that euv wave events with no cme correlation show smaller velocities compared to euv wave events associated with cmes .",
    "an explanation for this low correlation may be that in the early evolution of cmes the expansion in lateral as well as radial direction ( often noticed as spherical cme bubble ) is basically equally strong , whereas later on the radial evolution is dominant and the lateral weakens / finishes ( limited width of a cme versus radial evolution into ip space ) .",
    "thus , further out we measure more or less the radial evolution , hence , the coronagraphic measurements are biased and show a loose relation to euv waves . additionally , it is the main acceleration phase of the cme often occurs below @xmath85__r__@xmath86 @xcite that is probably the relevant factor for the euv wave generation . in this comparison , one has to consider that the extracted lasco / cme mean speeds are projected speeds they reflect the propagation behavior at distances far from the sun ( @xmath87__r__@xmath86 ) .",
    "detailed case studies of limb events including multipoint stereo observations have shown that there is a close relation between the cme expanding flanks and the euv wave , indicating that the fast expanding cme flanks initiate the euv wave @xcite .",
    "the flare association rate is considerably lower with a value of @xmath1574% , similar to the findings of , , and . as we are analyzing the events occurring during the rising phase of solar cycle 24 most of the associated flares are of sxr class a to c , and",
    "may thus not be energetic enough to act as driving agent .",
    "nevertheless , those events associated with a solar flare lead to a relatively good correlation coefficient of @xmath51 between the goes flare class and the euv wave velocities suggesting that both phenomena are related to each other .",
    "a similar trend of a loose correlation between the flares sxr class and euv speeds has also been noted by .",
    "they found that those wave events with higher speeds are accompanied by more intense flares .",
    "this can be explained , as the more energy released in an active region the more powerful a flare / cme event can become and thus the stronger the push to the surrounding corona which can generate a stronger and faster euv wave event .",
    "we note that those events without a cme association also lacked a solar flare association , namely the events of 16 may 2008 , 21 july 2008 , and 26 april 2009 . in these cases neither the cme nor the flare",
    "seem to be responsible for the initiation process . studied an euv wave without cme , concluding that it was driven by the associated jet .",
    "these observations support the scenario discussed by , in which the deciding factor for the launch of an euv wave or a coronal shock wave is the impulsive mass motion perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this mass motion may be related to a cme escaping to interplanetary space , but it might be also confined over a certain distance range in the solar atmosphere . in addition to the cme and flare association rate we investigated the type ii burst association rate and found a rate of 22% for coronal and 15% for interplanetary type ii bursts , indicating shock formation in the solar corona and in interplanetary space , respectively .",
    "this is a similar outcome to the study by with an association rate of euv waves to coronal type ii bursts of 23% .",
    "events observed in both st - a and st - b are of special interest as there is criticism @xcite whether kinematical results obtained from different vantage points are even comparable . in our study 8 out of 60 events were simultaneously observed from two vantage points . whereas in the beginning of the stereo mission",
    "the separation angle between the two s / c was small with @xmath158@xmath13 , the separation angle of @xmath1545@xmath13 in the early months of 2008 clarified the situation . for seven out of eight events the kinematical results from both spacecraft were consistent with each other within the uncertainties , similar to the case study by .",
    "for the event of 21 july 2008 the mean velocities obtained differ by about 20% for st - a and st - b , whereas the start velocities are similar , @xmath88375@xmath8975  km  s@xmath1 and @xmath90357@xmath89109  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this difference in the mean velocity is due to the fact that in the st - a observations more data points could be used , resulting in a longer observation time than for st - b . since the deceleration happens during the later stage the mean linear velocity is smaller for st - a than for st - b .",
    "these results indicate that the euv wave kinematics is not dramatically affected by the different vantage points .",
    "however , for two events ( 16 may 2008 and 21 july 2008 ) , where the s / c separation is comparatively large ( 70@xmath13 and 90@xmath13 ) , we found differences in the morphology and the perturbation amplitudes ( of @xmath1530% ) for st - a and st - b .",
    "this implies that the cme plasma can also contribute to the line - of - sight integrated optically thin emission across the wave front which highly depends on the geometry with respect to the observer as suggested by , and .",
    "these findings suggest that the perturbation amplitude may indeed be considerably affected by line - of - sight effects , and has thus to be interpreted with caution .    in conclusion",
    ", we find for the events under study a broad velocity range from close to the local fast magnetosonic speed @xmath91 up to remarkably higher velocities , a strong anticorrelation between acceleration and start velocities with the results that initially faster events decelerate stronger and events with zero acceleration propagate at nearly @xmath91 .",
    "this pronounced anticorrelation , the steepening , broadening and decaying of the transients perturbation profiles as well as correlations between the propagation velocity and perturbation profile characteristics ( _ e.g. _ amplitude , impulsiveness ) provide strong evidence that euv waves are indeed fast - mode mhd waves .    n.m .",
