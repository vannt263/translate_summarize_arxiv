    "all the states have the same period .",
    "when the period is 1 , we say the process is aperiodic .",

    "first the configuration is updated according to the rule of the eqp with parallel update . then the langmuir kinetics is applied .",
    "this defines the eqp - lk with parameters @xmath183 , which reduces to the eqp for @xmath184 .",
    "the eqp - lk can be interpreted as an effective model for interacting queues where the attachment and detachment corresponds to customers changing from and to other queues , respectively .",
    "thus the other queues are considered to act as reservoir for the eqp - lk .",
    "preliminary studies have found that the eqp - lk has surprising properties @xcite .",

    "in fact , in a certain parameter region , some samples appear to converge to a finite length whereas other samples appear to diverge ( within the simulation time ) , see fig .",

    "the percentage of apparently divergent samples depends strongly on the initial length @xmath185 of the queue .",
    "it is very small for small @xmath186 and becomes large for large @xmath186 .",
    "this surprising behavior is related to the length dependence of the attachment and detachment probabilities .",
    "once the queue has become short it is difficult to escape from @xmath187 after reaching @xmath187 since the detachment rate is large .",
    "thus , starting from a short queue @xmath188 , the length tends to remain finite . on the other hand , starting from long queues @xmath189 the chain tends to grow further because the detachment rate is small .",
    "these two observations contradict the general theory of markov processes .",
    "however , we can interpret the convergence from short queues as `` quasi stationary , '' and it is required very long time to reach e.g. @xmath190 , which is probably impossible to realize in our computer environment , see some observations on the first passage time @xcite . in this sense , the ergodicity of the eqp - lk is _ effectively _ broken . in other words , there is a very high maximum of the `` potential '' in a certain point @xmath191 .",
    "this is opposite property to a microtubule model @xcite , where the length can be regulated around @xmath192 .     starting from various initial lengths , for @xmath193 ( left ) and @xmath194 ( right ) .",

    "the interaction between the chains through exchange of particles is modeled through langmuir kinetics which allows the change of the particle number within the bulk of the queue .",
    "of course , the eqp can also be extended to a genuine multi - chain model . for applications ,",
    "2-chain models are of special interest . as a model for a bottleneck on a highway , a configuration as in fig .",

    "originally , queueing theory was developed mainly for applications in telecommunications .",
    "nowadays , however , it is a standard approach in various fields , ranging from supply chains @xcite to traffic flow and biology .    the most natural application of the eqp is queueing of pedestrians , e.g. at a supermarket checkout .",
    "this can be generalized in a straightforward way to multiple queues where customers might jump from one queue to another .",
    "a generalization where the probability of moving depends on the gap to the next customer in front was studied in @xcite .",
    "this might be realistic e.g. for queues at an airport check - in where the passingers have to pick up their luggage when moving forward .",
    "since this is uncomfortable they typically wait until a critical gap to the preceding passenger has opened .",
    "one advantage of the eqp and its relatives for applications is that it is an intrinsically microscopic model where the different `` units '' can be distinguished .",
    "therefore they can have different properties ( e.g. average velocities ) in a natural way .    in the context of vehicular traffic ,",
    "various queueing based models have been proposed , e.g. @xcite .",
    "even the cell transmission model @xcite might be interpreted as queueing model .",
    "often these models are used to study traffic on networks where links correspond to roads or road sections and nodes to intersections which are characterized by a service rate .",
    "in contrast , in the model developed in @xcite the trajectories of the vehicles are related to a m / m/1 queue by identifying space in the traffic model with time in the queueing model .",
    "other variants of the tasep on a lattice of varying length have been proposed as applications to biological systems . in @xcite",
    "the dynamically extending exclusion process ( deep ) has been introduced as a model for fungal growth . in the deep not all particles",
    "are removed from the system as they reach the end , but with some probability form a new lattice site .",
    "in contrast to the eqp , the deep has no mechanism for reducing the system length and therefore the length of the system is always diverging .",
    "microtubules @xcite are the analogues of highways in cells",
    ". however , their lengths are not constant , but changes dynamically .",
    "the mechanism of length regulation of microtubules has been investigated in @xcite using a variant of the tasep where the first ( output ) site can be removed or attached under certain conditions .",
    "similar models have been used to describe bacterial flagellar growth @xcite . in @xcite , a condition on parameters for the convergence of a simplified model of mictrotubules is discussed .",
    "this can be also rigorously derived by constructing a stationary measure in a similar form to that of the eqp @xcite .",
    "the exclusive queueing process ( eqp ) can be considered as a minimal model of pedestrian queues which takes into account the internal dynamics of the queue .",
    "we have found that the eqp has a rich phase diagram .",
    "surprisingly , it shows a strong dependence of its critical properties on the update scheme .",
    "this is rather different from the tasep with a fixed system length .",
    "the order of the phase transition between the diverging and converging phases can also be different .",
    "besides application to pedestrian queues and vehicular traffic , variants of the eqp have interesting applications to biological processes like fungal growth and microtubule length regulation .",
    "we expect that transport models with varying system lengths will show many other interesting phenomena .",
