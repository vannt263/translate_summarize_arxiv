    "in this work we investigate the hot exciton scattering rates in semiconductor narrow quantum wells ( qws ) .",
    "an exciton with kinetic energy higher than the thermal temperature of the medium is called a hot exciton .",
    "this concept has been introduced in the past when multiphonon lo - lines have been observed in resonant raman scattering in bulk semiconductor materials ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for polar semiconductors",
    "when the exciton energy is greater than a longitudinal optical phonon , the scattering rate is governed by the exciton - lo phonon interaction and the frhlich like mechanism is the stronger one playing the main role in the exciton relaxation time .    in the past and for the bulk semiconductor case , transition probabilities of hot excitons interacting with longitudinal and acoustic phonons",
    "have been carried out in refs .",

    "the dependence on exciton kinetic energy , effective electron and hole masses , and on the excitonic quantum numbers were obtained , showing the conditions that favored the hot excitons contribution to the multiphonon raman process in semiconductors .",
    "the importance of hot exciton relaxation via optical phonon emission in qws has been stressed by photoluminescence experiments @xcite and by time - resolved raman scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "also , the relative role of confined phonons and interface modes in time resolved resonant raman spectroscopy experiments is pointed out in ref . @xcite . today",
    ", there are several theoretical studies of carrier relaxation times in qws considering the main mechanism due to electron - lo - phonon interaction ( e.g. ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , a direct calculation of the hot exciton scattering rate due to the confined optical phonons in a qw is lacking in the literature .",
    "in this paper we will focus on the excitonic scattering rate calculation and on its contribution to the multiphonon resonant raman process ( mpr ) in narrow qws .",
    "mowbray et al @xcite reported a multiphonon process in gaas / alas superlattices .",
    "raman spectra for the second and third order processes from gaas phonons show structures involving the combination of confined and interface lo phonons .",
    "the relative intensities of the second and third order processes due to the combination of @xmath0 confined phonon are weaker than that obtained with @xmath0 and interface phonons for samples of 6-gaas monolayer .",
    "the enumeration of phonon symmetries in the qw follows ref .",
    "for the case of 10-gaas monolayer samples , the combined intensities of @xmath0 and @xmath1  phonons are comparable to the intensities due to @xmath2 or @xmath3 ones .",
    "these results show that the relative intensities of a mpr scattering process are very sensitive to the quantum well width .",
    "the connection of the mpr process with excitonic transitions followed when the excitonic cascade model is invoked to explain the main features of the scattered light @xcite . according to this model ,",
    "the scattering cross section with an emission of one emitted phonon is proportional to the exciton scattering rate @xmath4 with kinetic energy @xmath5 .",
    "thus , an explicit calculation of @xmath4 as a function of the qw width and phonon mode contribution will bring an further understanding of mpr process in qws as we will discuss bellow .",
    "the scattering probability per unit time of an exciton in a qw is given by the fermi `` golden rule ''    @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the energies at the initial and final states , @xmath9 is the matrix element describing the scattering of the hot exciton . for the case we are dealing with ,",
    "the transitions are due to the interaction between excitons and lo - phonons . in a qw",

    "@xcite . the function @xmath17 shows a definite parity @xcite and the corresponding analytical expression for phonon dispersion relation for odd and even potential states have been considered in ref .",
    "the phonon dispersion for a structure of gaas / alas with 2.0 nm and 1.7 nm well width are shown in fig .",
    "the branches are labeled as @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20=1,2 , ... ) according to their longitudinal and transverse character at @xmath21 .",
    "the modes which show a strong dispersion as a function of the in - plane wavevector @xmath12 are those with the strongest electric field component and also the strongest interface character .",
    "for the 2.0 nm qw the two interface branches are @xmath22 and @xmath1 modes , while in the case of fig .",
    "1(b ) these corresponds to @xmath23 and @xmath24 modes .",
    "the upper mode is purely antisymmetric ( @xmath22 ) while the lower interface mode ( @xmath1 and @xmath24 in figs .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) , respectively ) is symmetric .",
    "the antisymmetric part of the potential ( @xmath22 , @xmath25 modes ) couples to the exciton via inter - subband transitions with exciton wavefunctions having different symmetry with respect to the center of the well .",
    "the symmetric part of the function @xmath17 ( @xmath26 , @xmath1 modes ) couples to excitons via intra - subband transitions since the exciton wave function have the same symmetry respect to z - axis .",
    "the exciton inter - subband transition is also possible through the symmetric phonon potential part , if the initial and final excitonic states have the same parity with respect to the center of the qw .    for the excitonic states we assume a wannier - mott model in the quantum well in the strong quantization limit ( very narrow qws ) .",
    "in this case , the qw width is smaller than the exciton bohr radius @xmath27 ( d @xmath27 ) and the three - dimensional wannier exciton motion can be reduced to two - dimensional wannier exciton and one - dimensional electron and hole motion along the growth direction @xcite .",
    "hence , the wave function @xmath28 can be cast in the form    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the electron - hole pair center - of - mass coordinates on the x - y plane , @xmath31 is the in - plane relative coordinates .",

    "let us comment on the effect of the carrier effective masses on the scattering rate .",
    "first , the confinement is a function of the hole masses along the z - axis ; second , the hole - phonon matrix element depends on the hole masses through the @xmath111 factor and the range of values @xmath112 is a function of the electron - hole mass ( in plane along the z - axis ) ; third , the scattering probability value strongly depends on the in - plane density of states . fig .",

    "3(a ) the @xmath1 mode contribution is stronger than the @xmath0 , showing that the relative intensity between several phonon branches is only a function of the phonon dispersion which itself depends on the qw width .",

    "in conclusion we have performed an analysis of the exciton scattering rate in narrow qws .",
    "the relaxation of hot excitons accounts for the emission of confined and interface optical longitudinal phonons due to the frhlich - like exciton - phonon interaction .",
    "the results obtained above show a different behavior of the scattering probability as a function of the well width and in - plane exciton kinetic energy .",
    "the value of @xmath116 is not equal to zero for @xmath117 ( for the case of intra - subband transition ) , increases with increasing @xmath94 reaching a maximum and beginning to fall according to the law @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "the relative strength of the different phonon modes is proportional to the ratio of the square of their overlap integral of the function @xmath17 with initial and final electron and hole subband states in the gaas / alas qw . for a given phonon state ,",
    "inter - subband transitions are less efficient processes on the exciton relaxation time in comparison with the intraband probability .",
    "the intra - subband scattering rate is accompanied only by symmetric phonon states ( @xmath119 ) in correspondence with the observed multiphonon raman spectra in a series of short - period gaas / alas superlattices @xcite . the reported multiphonon peaks involving pure overtones of gaas phonons are combinations of the even confined modes ( see fig . 6 in ref .",
