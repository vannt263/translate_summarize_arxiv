    "the lorentz and cpt invariance of the physical laws have been confirmed with high accuracy in numerous experiments @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one may make an assumption that these symmetries , for some unknown reasons , are only approximate .",
    "the modern quantum field theoretical viewpoint admits the possibility of lorentz invariance breaking ( and , as a consequence , possible cpt invariance breaking in the local field theory ) through a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism . in other words , even though the underlying laws of nature have lorentz and cpt symmetries , the vacuum solution of the theory could spontaneously violate these symmetries .",
    "the usual standard model does not have dynamics necessary to cause spontaneous lorentz and cpt violation .",
    "however , the violation mentioned above could occur in a more complicated theory , i.e. , the standard model extension ( sme)@xcite . a basic requirement of such an extended model is that it preserves fundamental properties , such as renormalizability , unitarity and gauge invariance .",
    "in contrast to usual electrodynamics with its vacuum state being invariant under lorentz and cpt transformations , in the extended model , this vacuum state appears to be filled up by `` fields '' , which have a certain orientation in space , and this is the cause of lorentz symmetry breaking .",
    "technically , a realization of this violation might be obtained through adding two different kinds of cpt - odd interaction terms .",
    "the first of them represents a four dimensional analogue of the well known chern - simons term @xmath0 with a constant vector @xmath1 , the second one is the cpt - odd interaction term for fermions @xmath2 with a constant vector @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the latter kind of modification does not influence the gauge invariance of the action and equations of motion , but it does modify the dispersion relations for dirac spinors @xcite .",
    "the question about the possible dynamical origin of these constant vectors @xmath1 and @xmath3 remains an interesting task to be solved .",
    "in particular , one of the possible ways for the lorentz symmetry to be broken through the coleman - weinberg mechanism @xcite was recently suggested for models , where abelian gauge fields interact with a pseudoscalar massless axion field @xmath4 . it was shown that in this case , the vector @xmath1 could be associated with the vacuum expectation value of the gradient of the axion field @xmath5 @xcite . at the same time , the pseudovector field @xmath3 might be related to some constant background torsion in the large scale universe , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "moreover , such a cpt - odd term could be generated by chiral fermions @xcite .",
    "a modification of qed resulting in the appearance of a cs like term may predict the phenomena known as birefringence of light @xcite . as it was mentioned above , a cpt - odd interaction term for fermions is also possible in the framework of the sme , and , in this case , there arises a natural question about a possibility of generation of the cs like term through radiative corrections from the fermionic sector of the general theory .",
    "there are many papers devoted to investigating such an interesting possibility , when a constant pseudovector field is present in the theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "it was shown , that the presence of the background vector @xmath3 , indeed , leads to the radiatively induced chern - simons term , i.e. , to the modified value of the classical tree level vector @xmath1 .",
    "however , there was an ambiguity in the definition of this correction , which was supposed to be due to the choice of the regularization procedure @xcite .",
    "but , as it has been clearly shown in one of the recent papers @xcite , the magnitude of this effect does not depend on the regularization scheme , but only on the requirement that the maximal residual symmetry , being the small group of the specific vector @xmath3 , is realized at quantum level order - by - order in the perturbation theory .",
    "this leads to a unique and non - vanishing value of the radiatively induced cs coefficient .",
    "yet another question , which also seems very interesting for investigation , is the temperature dependence of this generated term . in the present paper",
    ", we study the one - loop contributions to the antisymmetric component of the photon polarization operator in an external constant axial - vector field @xmath3 at finite temperature .",
    "these contributions , due to fermion loops , are obtained in the linear order in the pseudo vector field . as a result",
    ", we obtained the exact analytical expression for a thermally induced chern - simons term . at the same time , in considering the influence of the background axial - vector field on photon propagation , one should also take into account the influece of the color vacuum fields on the quark loops . for this purpose , in the second part of the paper , we calculate in the one - loop approximation the effective potential for this model , when both a color magnetic and an axial - vector background field are present .",
    "then , in the lowest order in the color magnetic field , we calculate the first nontrivial correction to the result for the chern - simons term obtained earlier @xcite .",
