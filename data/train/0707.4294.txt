    "the spin coherence of electronic states is one of the key features involved in numerous concepts for spintronics devices ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "it has been studied in semiconductor structures of different dimensionality , including bulk - like thin films , quantum wells ( qws ) and quantum dots .",
    "accordingly , the spin coherence time of an electron has been found to vary over a wide range from a few picoseconds up to a few microseconds .",
    "an ensemble of electron spins subject to a magnetic field is commonly characterized by three relaxation times @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal spin relaxation time @xmath0 , which is related to the relaxation of the spin component parallel to the field , and the transverse relaxation times @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath1 time describes spin decoherence ( i.e. relaxation of the spin components transverse to the field ) of a _ single _ electron , while the @xmath2 time describes the dephasing of the whole spin ensemble .",
    "the coherence time @xmath1 of a single spin is often few orders of magnitude longer than the dephasing time @xmath2 of a spin ensemble .",

    "a @xmath2 of 300 ns has been measured in bulk gaas by means of the hanle effect on optically oriented electrons at liquid helium temperature @xcite .",
    "for qws the longest spin dephasing times reported so far are 10 ns for gaas/(al , ga)as @xcite and 30 ns for cdte/(cd , mg)te @xcite . they have been measured for structures with a very diluted two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "electron spin coherence in cdte/(cd , mg)te qws attracts recently an increasing interest @xcite .",
    "figure 1 illustrates three typical situations realized in experiments on coherent spin dynamics under resonant optical excitation of the qws .",
    "these cases are different in the density of resident 2d electrons , @xmath5 . in the undoped samples [ panel ( a ) ,",
    "@xmath6 spin oriented excitons are photogenerated .",
    "usually hole spin dephasing occurs within several picoseconds and the coherent response is mainly determined by the spin dynamics of the electron in the exciton .",
    "this dynamics can not be studied for time scales exceeding the exciton lifetime as the exciton recombination depopulates the photoexcited states . for the dense 2deg [ panel ( c ) , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the exciton bohr radius ] , exciton formation is suppressed because of state - filling and screening effects .",
    "after photogeneration a hole looses its spin and energy quickly and recombines with an electron from the fermi see .",
    "however , the spin oriented electron photogenerated at the fermi level has an infinite lifetime which allows one to study its long - lived spin coherence and spin relaxation . in this case",
    "a circularly polarized photon can increase the spin polarization of the 2deg by @xmath9 . in case of a diluted 2deg [ panel ( b ) , @xmath10 the mechanism for generation of the electron spin coherence is not so obvious .",
    "indeed the ground state is a singlet trion with an antiparallel orientation of electron spins .",
    "being resonantly excited , this state would not contribute to the spin polarization because the hole undergoes fast decoherence and the total spin of the two electrons is @xmath11 .",
    "however , generation of electron spin coherence has been observed experimentally under resonant excitation of trions in qws @xcite and quantum dots @xcite .",
    "there are two equivalent approaches to explain the generation mechanism in this case .",
    "the first one suggests that a coherent superposition of electron and trion states is excited by a circular polarized photon when the system is subject to an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the second one considers the 2d electrons captured for trion formation : under circular polarized excitation electrons with a specific spin orientation will be extracted from the 2deg and correspondingly spin polarization with the opposite sign will be induced @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report on a detailed study of the coherent spin dynamics of electrons and electron - hole complexes in cdte / cd@xmath12mg@xmath13te qws with a low density 2deg , performed by a pump - probe kerr rotation ( kr ) technique .",
    "a theoretical analysis of the various mechanisms of spin coherence generation is carried out .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii is devoted to ( i ) the theoretical analysis of the physical mechanisms leading to kerr and faraday rotation of the probe pulse polarization , and ( ii ) the theoretical description of various scenarios of electron spin coherence generation .",

    "then a much weaker , linearly - polarized probe pulse with the frequency either coinciding with or different from the pump frequency arrives at the sample .",

    "in most cases , however , for these experimental conditions the trions are formed from photogenerated excitons , which dominate the absorption due to their larger oscillator strength . as a result the decay of the trion pl in this case is determined not by trion recombination but by trion formation , and will monitor the exciton lifetime . for small detuning exemplified by curve 3 , the fast 30 ps process coexists with the longer ( 100 ps ) one . when the excitation energy is tuned to the band - to - band absorption ( curve 4 , @xmath209  mev ) ,",

    "the shortening of the electron spin dephasing time from 5.7 down to 3.5 - 3.6 ns is attributed to heating of the 2deg by photocarriers with excess kinetic energy ( for a detailed discussion see sections iii.d and iii.e ) .",
    "the kerr rotation signal probed at the exciton energy has two contributions : ( i ) given by the coherent precession of the electrons in excitons and ( ii ) given by the spin precession of the 2deg .",

    "the relative amplitudes of the fast and long - lived signals reflect the probability of trion and exciton formation .",
    "it may be expected that trion formation is preferable because the 2deg density exceeds by at least an order of magnitude the concentration of photocarriers which is in line with the experimental findings .",
    "a very different ratio of the relative amplitudes , 90% for the fast decay and 10% for the long - living dynamics , is seen for the signal when resonantly pumped at the exciton energy and detected at the exciton [ see panel ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : a3 ] ] .",
    "there are at least two factors which favor an exciton population in comparison with a trion one under resonant pumping of the excitons .",
    "first , the photogeneration leads to formation of excitons with very low kinetic energy , therefore they remain within the radiative cone and quickly recombine ( during 30 - 50 ps ) prior to becoming bound to trions @xcite .",
    "second , a part of excitons is localized , so that they are not mobile and can not reach the sites in the qw where the background electrons are localized . consequently , the formation of trions out of this exciton reservoir is suppressed .",
    "moreover , the ratio between the contributions of the excitons and the 2deg to the kr signal is spectrally dependent : detection at the exciton resonance is more sensitive to the spin precession of the electron in the exciton , see sec .",
    "ii . c.    the results of the two - color experiments presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : a3 ] are in good agreement with the model expectations , namely : ( i ) the signal oscillating with the electron larmor frequency is contributed by resident electrons of the 2deg and by electrons precessing in the excitons , ( ii ) trion formation resulting either from resonant photoexcitation of the trions or from capture of excitons or free carriers is a very efficient mechanism for spin coherence generation in a diluted 2deg .",

    "the strong temperature dependence of the measured signals can be explained by two mechanisms : ( i ) delocalization of electrons and ( ii ) dissociation of trions . at very low temperatures",
    "@xmath237  mev , both electrons and photogenerated trions are localized in the quantum well plane by alloy fluctuations and/or interface roughnesses . the kerr rotation signal at fixed pumping is proportional to the number of photogenerated trions .",
    "increase of the temperature up to @xmath238  mev is accompanied by electron delocalization which in turn leads to a decrease of the interaction between photogenerated electron - hole pairs and electrons .",
    "thus , the number of photogenerated trions decreases .",
    "further , the increase of the temperature leads to thermal dissociation of trions , whose number is proportional to @xmath239 , where @xmath240  mev .",

    "the total spin of the electron ensemble precesses around the external magnetic field .",
    "the decay of the total spin with increasing delay is governed by the spin dephasing processes .",
    "the spins of the electrons forming a trion are in a singlet state and therefore do not precess around the magnetic field as the resident electrons do .",
    "recombination of trions leads to return of the partially @xmath14-polarized electrons to the 2deg .",
    "their spin orientation differs from that of the precessing electrons , which results in a shift of the initial phase of the measured kr signal , see eq . .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : aa2 ] , where the full arrow shows the total spin of the 2deg , while the open arrow shows the spin of the returned electrons .",
    "one can see that after trion recombination the total spin of the electron gas has been rotated by a larger angle as compared with the rotation of the resident electrons spin .",
    "this induces a phase - shift of the oscillating kerr signal .",
    "we have analyzed the initial phase by extrapolation of the spin beats at longer delays back toward zero delay .",
    "the experiments were performed at low excitation density with pump / probe at the trion resonance .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp8 ] . a pronounced minimum",
    "is seen at @xmath242  t in qualitative agreement with the model calculations shown by the solid line , which was calculated with a trion lifetime @xmath243  ps .",
    "we also assumed an electron spin dephasing time @xmath244  ns ( which corresponds to the experimental value at @xmath245  t ) . in experiment this time is longer at smaller fields .",
    "however , the calculated curve is insensitive to the choice of this value as far as @xmath81 remains the longest time in the system .",
    "the only free parameter in the calculations was the spin relaxation time of the hole in a trion @xmath246 .",
    "the two curves correspond to @xmath247  ps ( dashed ) and @xmath248  ps ( solid ) .",
    "it is seen , that in accordance with eqs . and , the depth of the mininum and its field position is controlled by @xmath246 .",
    "the model results demonstrate qualitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "w@xmath212@xmath213 and probe density @xmath249  w@xmath212@xmath213 .",
    "the model calculations have been performed according to eq.([phasenew ] ) . ]      as we have already noted above , the studied sample contains a diluted 2deg with the fermi energy smaller than the typical localization potential caused by well width fluctuations . as a result , at low temperatures of both the lattice and the electron gas , a major fraction of electrons is localized .",
    "we have concluded also from the pump density and temperature dependencies that the dephasing time @xmath2 is strongly sensitive to electron localization , see figs .",
    "[ fig : exp4 t ] and [ fig : exp6 t ] .",
    "@xmath2 can be extremely long for the localized electrons and shortens with electron delocalization .    to have a deeper insight into the effects of electron localization on the spin coherence we have done two - color pump - probe measurements in the regime where the longest dephasing times have been achieved ,",
    "i.e. using a low pump density in a weak magnetic field of 0.25  t. figure  [ fig : exp9 ] shows the results of such an experiment , where the pump beam is resonant with the exciton transition and the kerr rotation signal is detected at either the trion or the exciton energy . under these experimental conditions",
    "the fast decaying component is very small for probing at the exciton energy .",
    "the excitation conditions are identical for both signals in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp9 ] , therefore one can expect to detect the same dephasing times for the 2deg , irrespective of the probe energy . therefore , it is rather surprising to observe that the dephasing times of the electron coherence differ by a factor of two : @xmath250 and 5.3  ns for probing at the trion and the exciton resonance , respectively .",
    "k. pump density @xmath170  w@xmath212@xmath213 and probe density @xmath251  w@xmath212@xmath213 . ]",
    "to explain this difference we suggest that different fractions of the resident electrons contribute to the kerr rotation signal measured at the trion or the exciton energies .",
    "this can be understood if we take into account that different mechanisms lead to kerr rotation signal at the exciton and trion energy . for detection at the trion resonance",
    "the effect is contributed by the variation of the trion oscillator strength , which is directly proportional to the concentration of electrons with a specific spin orientation , see sec .",
    "a. as the in - plain localization is important to achieve stability of the trions in qws one may expect that the trions are much more dependent on the localized electrons , which have a longer dephasing time .",
    "the kerr rotation signal at free exciton energy monitors 2deg spin beats mostly due to the spin - dependent exciton - electron scattering , see sec .",
    "ii . c. and ref .",
    "possibility for this scattering to occur implies existence of free electrons .",
    "therefore , at the exciton energy we address free or quasi - free resident electrons which have shorter dephasing times .",
    "we have demonstrated experimentally the possibility to excite spin coherence of a 2deg by resonant pumping into the trion or the exciton states , as well as by non - resonant excitation .",
    "it was shown that the time - resolved kerr rotation signal detected experimentally at the trion and exciton frequencies contains two components : a fast contribution ( which vanishes @xmath252  ps after the pump pulse ) and a long - living one ( with typical decay times of the order of nanoseconds ) . the fast component is related with electrons - in - excitons , while the long one is due to the resident electrons of the 2deg .",
    "experimentally we can clearly separate these contributions .",
    "a theoretical model has been developed to describe various scenarios of spin coherence generation in qws with a 2deg .",
    "it is based on a classical approach to spins and accounts for resonant excitation in the trion and exciton resonances and also for nonresonant photoexcitation .",
    "a comprehensive set of experimental results is consistently described in the frame of this model .",
    "the suggested model can be generalized to the description of spin coherence generation in a 2d hole gas . in this case",
    "the in - plane component of the heavy - hole @xmath19-factor is negligible and , therefore , the regime of weak magnetic fields is realized .",
    "it can be expected that due to the stronger spin orbit interaction the free hole spin relaxation is faster than that of free electrons . on the other hand , in a low density hole gas",
    "most of the carriers are localized , so that the role of the spin orbit interaction is diminished and the hole spin relaxation times can reach up to 600  ps in gaas/(al , ga)as qws @xcite , for example .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note here , that the results of our model consideration can be also applied to for describing the excitation of spin coherence in other low - dimensional semiconductor structures such as in an ensemble of singly - charged quantum dots .",
