    ", some aspects of the rosensweig instability have been addressed only recently : the hexagon - square transition @xcite or the wave number selection problem @xcite .",
    "the wave number is the absolute value of the wave vector , @xmath1 , which characterizes small disturbances .",
    "the ground state of a pattern forming system is subjected to such small disturbances in order to study its stability .",
    "the corresponding growth rate @xmath2 may depend on system parameters @xmath3 , e.g. the viscosity of the fluid , and control parameters @xmath4 , e.g. an external magnetic field , @xmath5 .",
    "generally it is assumed that in the linear stage of the pattern forming process the wave number with the largest growth rate will prevail .",
    "therefore this mode is called linearly most unstable mode . due to its role in the pattern formation it is of particular interest to examine the maximal growth rate @xmath6 , and its dependence on the different parameters .",
    "this dependence has received only limited attention in classical hydrodynamic systems . for the kppers - lortz ( kl )",
    "instability in rayleigh - bnard convection rotated about a vertical axis , the growth rate of different kl angles were calculated for one fixed rotation rate and different temperature differences @xcite . in surface - tension - driven bnard convection",
    "the growth rates are calculated for two fixed values of heat loss and different temperature differences @xcite .",
    "but in both systems it was not analysed how @xmath6 depends on the control parameters . in the problem of convection for autocatalytic reaction fronts ,",
    "the maximal growth rate was analysed only for the two distinct limits of infinite and zero thermal diffusivity @xcite . in both cases a power law",
    "was found relating the increase of the maximal growth rate with the density difference in the fluid .",
    "for the rayleigh - taylor instability of superposed incompressible viscous fluids , the maximal growth rate was analysed for appropriately scaled densities and viscosities in @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath6 on the remaining parameter , the scaled surface tension , is given by a single function covering the whole range of possible values of the surface tension .",
    "with respect to experiments , no measurements focusing on the maximal growth rate have yet been undertaken .    particularly in magnetically or electrically driven systems",
    "the fastest growing mode is experimentally accessible .",
    "if the field is increased with a sudden jump , a pattern characterized by the linearly most unstable mode should be observed .",
    "the validity of this conclusion was shown recently for the rosensweig instability in magnetic fluids @xcite . the lack of studies and the experimental access motivates this letter , where the dependence of the maximal growth rate on the properties of the magnetic fluid and the external magnetic induction is studied .",

    "the electrically insulating fluid justifies the stationary form of the maxwell equations , which reduce to the laplace equation for the magnetic potentials in the region of the container , the magnetic fluid , and the air .",

    "near the upper bound of the expansion region cubic corrections occur . for @xmath66 , @xmath40 depends primarily _ linearly _ on @xmath0 because @xmath67 .",
    "this linear dependence was already studied in @xcite and a good agreement was found between the measured values and the theoretical data .",
    "the fits  ( 14 ) and ( 16 ) give only the dependence of @xmath68 and @xmath40 on the scaled magnetic induction .",
