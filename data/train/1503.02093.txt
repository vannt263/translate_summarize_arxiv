    "efficiency for producing light has significant consequences for society .",
    "energy consumption for global lighting produces 2 billion tons of @xmath0  each year , 20%  of which is produced by 1.6 billion people burning kerosene and paraffin@xcite accounting for 7% of all energy related black carbon climate forcing.@xcite improving lighting efficiency is widely recognized as an important measure to help mitigate sources of climate change.@xcite oleds may contribute to this to the extent that they meet or exceed the efficiency of other lighting devices and improve the environmental footprint for manufacturing and using lighting devices .",
    "efficiency has been a focus of oled research since the first devices were announced@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite for these reasons and as a proxy for understanding certain aspects of oled device physics .",
    "external quantum efficiency , defined as photons extracted per charge injected , has been described as a product of four processes,@xcite @xmath1    where @xmath2  is the charge carrier balance factor ( the fraction of the charge carrier currents that forms electron - hole pairs ) , @xmath3  is the singlet - triplet factor ( the fraction of radiative excited state species formed from charge carrier recombination ) , @xmath4  is the quantum efficiency of the radiative species ( the fraction that decay radiatively ) , and @xmath5  is the out - coupling factor ( the fraction of photons that exit the device through the intended exit face ) . it is widely held that out - coupling is now the remaining challenge to external efficiency , and much work has focused on this in recent years@xcite though important advances have been obtained in devices that address out - coupling alongside other ohmic and energetic loss mechanisms.@xcite    efficiency droop , also called roll - off , where efficiency decreases with increasing power output , is still a common feature of oleds .",
    "droop can be caused by triplet - triplet annihilation and triplet - polaron quenching as the number density of excited state species increases.@xcite @xcite this is in addition to ohmic losses and decreased carrier balance for devices that operate over a large voltage range .",
    "the device reported here uses a microcavity to create a low threshold for output from stimulated emission coupled to a vertical cavity mode with spontaneous emission into the mode forbidden .",
    "the vertical mode directly addresses out - coupling and other loss mechanisms appear as a constant offset in a linear relationship between current and light .",
    "the resulting device exhibits current driven behavior with bias approaching an asymptote within about 0.2v of turn - on .",
    "thus external and internal efficiencies are addressed by shifting the process to stimulated emission resulting in a high efficiency device with no droop .    in the following ,",
    "we describe microcavity enhancement and suppression of spontaneous emission , and then consider rate equations for a microcavity oled and derive efficiency for operation in both limiting cases , a device dominated by stimulated emission and a device dominated by spontaneous emission with varying levels of cavity enhancement .",
    "we then report first results for two stimulated emission devices .",
    "for a microcavity of optical length l(@xmath6 ) , formed between parallel planar mirrors of reflectivity @xmath7  and @xmath8 , with an emitter ( spontaneous emission ) located at optical distance @xmath9  from the @xmath7  mirror , the normalized intensity of light exiting the @xmath8  and is given by @xmath10 } { 1 + r_{\\scriptscriptstyle 1 } r_{\\scriptscriptstyle 2 }   - 2 \\sqrt{r_{\\scriptscriptstyle 1 } r_{\\scriptscriptstyle 2 } }   \\cos ( 4 \\pi   \\frac{\\rm l(\\lambda ) } { \\lambda } ) } \\ ] ] where the optical lengths are calculated as a sum over index of refraction times the mechanical length for each intervening layer , plus the penetration depth for each reflector.@xcite @xcite    the significance of this for layered electroluminescent devices is illustrated in the following figure , where the normalized output from spontaneous emission is calculated for a one wavelength cavity , with reflectivities 1.0 and 0.8 , and free space line - width 0.10 .    spontaneous emission output from a one wavelength cavity as a function of emitter location , with units scaled such that wavelength = 1 .",
    "]    as is evident in fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] , spontaneous emission is completely suppressed for a thin emitter located at the anti - nodes , @xmath11  and @xmath12 , and strongly enhanced in the region of the node at @xmath13 .",
    "this is reversed for stimulated emission .",
    "classically , the suppression of spontaneous emission at the anti - nodes corresponds to destructive interference from the emitted field reflected by the mirrors . for stimulated emission",
    ", the process is driven by a photon already in the cavity mode , and the emitted photon is always in phase with the stimulating photon as well as being aligned to it.@xcite thus we can construct a microcavity device in which the output is nearly entirely stimulated emission by simply locating a thin emitter at the `` classically forbidden '' position for spontaneous emission .",
    "we consider a one wavelength microcavity with @xmath14 .",
    "equation   then reduces to @xmath15 the output from spontaneous emission at the anti - node is identically zero . for a point near the anti - node @xmath16",
    ", the output is @xmath17 for a thin slab centered at the anti - node we expect the contribution from spontaneous emission to fall off as the cube of the thickness .",
    "the output from spontaneous emission at the node , @xmath13 , is @xmath18 for @xmath8  from 10% to 90% , there is an enhancement on order of @xmath19  to @xmath20  for spontaenous emission into the cavity mode .",
    "emission couples to a cavity mode as a product of the transition dipole moment and the electric field vector of the cavity mode , @xmath21 this means we have two ways to select for emission into a vertical cavity mode .",
    "we can construct the device with a dielectric mirror such that only vertical modes are allowed as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , or we can use emitters whose transition dipole moments are oriented normal to the vertical mode as in fig .",
    "these are referred to as the multi - layer mirror microcavity oled ( mlm oled ) and the symmetrized emitter microcavity oled ( sem oled ) .",
    "in both devices , the ideal configuration has a thin emitter layer located at @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , for @xmath24    emitter materials exhibiting the orientation required for the sem oled have been reported for vapor deposited thin films and solution deposited thin films.@xcite @xcite @xcite these include triplet emitters and polymers . in those reports ,",
    "horizontal orientation is seen as a way to increase the vertical content of the generated light . here",
    "we locate the emitter at a point in the microcavity where output by spontaneous emission is suppressed and instead output is dominated by stimulated emission .    mlm oled device with bragg reflector , optical length equal to one wavelength and emitter at the anti - node . ]",
    "sem oled device with emitter transition dipole moments in - plane . ]",
    "we can write rate equations@xcite for the vertical cavity mode in the proposed device architecture as @xmath25 @xmath26    where @xmath27  is the density of excited state species formed by electron - hole recombination , @xmath2  is the charge carrier balance factor ( we assume an emitter with @xmath28 ) , @xmath29  is the active volume , @xmath30  is the gain coefficient for stimulated emission , @xmath31  is the photon density , @xmath32  is the attenuation or enhancement of spontaneous emission into the cavity mode , @xmath33  is the free space relaxation lifetime , @xmath34  is the non - radiative relaxation lifetime , @xmath35  is the coefficient for radiative loss due to spontaneous emission outside of the cavity mode , @xmath36  is the coefficient for second order losses including triplet - triplet annihilation,@xcite@xcite and @xmath37  is the cavity lifetime .",
    "the cavity lifetime , for a microcavity with optical length l(@xmath6 ) with exit mirror reflectivity r , is given by@xcite @xmath38 for an optical microcavity device the cavity lifetime is on order of @xmath39  secs to @xmath40  secs for @xmath41 .",
    "the non - radiative and free space radiative lifetimes are on order of or greater than @xmath42  secs .    for a thin emitter located at the anti - node , @xmath32  approaches zero , and so in steady state",
    "we obtain , @xmath43 and from the second rate equation , @xmath27  is a constant , @xmath44 with light output l equal to @xmath45 , we can write equation   as @xmath46 where @xmath47  represents the constant loss terms .    in other words , for the microcavity device with the thin emitter at the anti - node , we expect to see linear conversion of current to light with a constant offset .",
    "as we increase current the device should become more efficient approaching an asymptote , and there should be no roll - off from quenching . with an oriented emitter",
    "the radiative losses should be smaller , and so we expect the sem oled with oriented emitters , to be a little more efficient at moderate output than the mlm device with randomly oriented emitters .",
    "we consider now a microcavity with emitter at the node .",
    "output is dominated by spontaneous emission and the steady state solution for the second rate equation gives @xmath48 in this device the photon population is proportional to the recombined electron - hole pair population , and so the efficiency relationship becomes @xmath49 for comparison to the stimulated emission device , we write the efficiency relationship for the spontaneous emission device as @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "the efficiency relationship thus exhibits roll - off and an overall coefficient that combines enhancement , quantum efficiency and radiative losses . for a large enhancement factor @xmath52 , the overall coefficient approaches 1 ( corresponding to a high finesse cavity ) , and the second order loss term is attenuated through the dependence of @xmath53  on @xmath54 . for @xmath55 , at low l , efficiency is determined by radiative versus non - radiative decay and radiative losses .",
    "suppression with @xmath56  and output from spontaneous emission approaching 0 , occurs only with the emitter approaching the anti - node .",
    "finally we consider a device with contributions from both stimulated emission and spontaneous emission .",
    "the second rate equation gives for the excited state population @xmath57 and so @xmath27  varies with @xmath31  similar to the spontaneous emission device over some part of its operating range .",
    "the intermediate device approaches stimulated emission ( @xmath27  constant ) only for @xmath58 .",
    "we note that almost any planar oled can be described as a microcavity device ( though not necessarily resonant ) and will have an enhancement factor described by equation  , and in the absence of stimulated emission , its efficiency will be as described by equation  .",
    "a stimulated emission device with high carrier balance and low ohmic losses , can approach unit efficiency as power is increased because the loss terms are proportional to @xmath27  which is held constant .",
    "cavity finesse does not explicitly enter into the efficiency relationship except as the emitter layer thickness increases . a device in which spontaneous emission dominates the output might achieve unit efficiency but only if it has high carrier balance , low ohmic losses , high quantum yield , negligible radiative losses , and is operated at low power or has a very large enhancement factor .",
    "so , we expect that stimulated emission devices will generally be a more practical route to high efficiency at high power .",
    "mlm oled and sem oled devices were fabricated by thermal vapor deposition under high vacuum ( @xmath59  torr).@xcite the mlm device configuration is schematically , glass/ multilayer  mirror(tio2/ sio2)xn/ ito/ htl/ eml(yellow)/ etl/ al/ @xmath60100%dbr(tio2/ sio2)xn , with optical length 475 nm and emitter of optical thickness @xmath60 50 nm centered on the first anti - node relative to the top mirror .",

    "light - current - voltage data for the mlm oled is shown in fig .",
    "power was supplied from a bench supply operated in voltage controlled mode .",
    "current was measured across a 100 ohm resistor in series with the oled .",
    "bias voltage was measured across the oled .",
    "light was measured using an extech ea31 with the detector at approximately 1 cm from the device .",
    "the supply voltage was incremented in 0.1 steps , and voltage setting , bias voltage , current , and light readings were recorded at each step .",
    "power efficiency for the mlm oled was measured independently on a separate occasion using an integrating sphere and reported as 318 lm / w .",
    "the sem oled was fabricated on a pixelated anode ito substrate ( osilla ) , in a total effort of one evening for the first specimens .",
    "luminous efficiency was measured using an ilt 1700 research radiometer and 10  light sphere from international light technologies and found to be 340 lm / w , a 10% improvement over the mlm device .",
    "l - i - v data for an mlm type oled with emitter at quarter wavelength position . ]",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , light and current take - off abruptly after about 2.6 volts .",
    "the light - current - voltage behavior is shown in more detail in fig .",
    "light and current rise together with current only slightly ahead of light . at 2.607 to 2.613 ( @xmath610.006 ) volts , there is a small jump in current and light together , after which they quickly converge . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we see that light versus current follows the expected linear relationship ( equation  ) from about 20 ma and upwards .",
    "we note that the bias voltage at the jump corresponds to a wavelength of 475 nm , which matches the cavity length , and that the transition to linear behavior occurs at this data point in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ]  we fit the current - voltage behavior to a mott - gurney square law with poole - frenkel type dependence of mobility on field,@xcite@xcite @xmath62 where carrier mobility @xmath63 .",
    "there are two distinct regions in the log plot with the coefficient @xmath64  changing from about 71/@xmath65  below the transition to about @xmath66  above the transition , a factor of two on a per volt basis .",
    "the low current region can also be fit to a trap fill limit ( tfl ) model,@xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68  and @xmath69  is the trap energy",
    ". a log - log fit to our data in the low current region gives @xmath70k ( 1.2 ev ) .",
    "however the apparent close relationship between the change in current - voltage behavior and the transition to linear output , suggests that there may be more to learn about what is happening in charge mobility accompanying this transition .",
    "power efficiency for the device is graphed in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] as kfc / w .",
    "the power efficiency increases rapidly and then appears to approach an asymptote .",
    "the end point , converted from kfc , is about 315 lm / w and is in agreement with the independent measurement of 318 lm / w .",
    "this is fairly unusual in oleds .",
    "it is however consistent with equation  for a stimulated emission device .",
    "the sem version of the device differs from the mlm in having a self - oriented emitter layer and omitting multi - layer mirrors .",
    "this implementation also has injection and blocking layers .",
    "however , the device in terms of optical lengths was specifically designed to implement the ideas proposed here , and at 340 lm / w it is substantially beyond the efficiency of any other device reported in the literature .",
    "early microcavity oleds show line sharpening@xcite  and enhancements in external efficiency up to a factor of four@xcite .",
    "more recently , devices have been reported with power efficiencies at 110 lm / w and 140 lm / w.@xcite however , those devices droop from the beginning of the reported operating range as expected from the analysis leading up to equation  . in an extensive review of literature of microcavity oleds , no devices were found in which a thin emitter was located at the anti - node and no devices were found that exhibited the performance reported here .",
    "so it seems that the stimulated emission oled is different from previous devices in terms of architecture , performance and electrical behavior .",
    "light and current versus voltage in the operating range of the device . ]",
    "light versus current .",
    "the behavior is linear from 20 ma , with a small negative offset . ]",
    "log mobility square root of voltage for the mlm .",
    "the change in slope occurs at the transition to linear light versus current . ]",
    "power efficiency as kfc / w .",
    "the efficiency curve increases and appears to approach an asymptote . ]",
    "the stimulated emission devices reported here , with emitter at the anti - node , demonstrate unambiguously high output well above all previously reported devices .",
    "light versus current measured for the mlm device follows the relationship predicted in equation  .",
    "the increasing efficiency is consistent with the linear relationship between light and current .",
    "there is possibly an interesting electrical behavior in the transition to linear output , which merits further study .    the sem version of the device proved to be easy to make , and the first effort produced a new efficiency record for oleds at 340 lm / w while the mlm device achieved 315 lm / w .",
    "the analysis presented here suggests that while similar efficiency might be available in a spontaneous emission device it would be challenging to produce such a device without roll - off .",
    "the stimulated emission oled therefore seems to offer some advantages over spontaneous emission devices , and the sem oled in particular may be a useful and relatively easy to make , high efficiency oled .",
    "a contemplated application for the devices described here , in addition to lighting and displays , is as building blocks for organic transistors , in which the optical current is controlled by dynamically altering the cavity or depleting the excited state population into another mode .",
    "cavity lifetimes are fast , however the response time for such a device may be dominated by the stimulated emission time .",
    "therefore time resolved spectroscopy above and below and during the transition to the the linear region may be helpful in determining whether such devices would be useful for fast optical switching or computing .",
    "optical length in a microcavity in an oled device is the sum of optical lengths of intervening layers plus the penetration depths of mirrors . for a device with a quarter wave stack ,",
