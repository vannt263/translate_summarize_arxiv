    "astronomical observation on the cosmic microwave background(cmb ) anisotropy@xcite , supernova type ia(snia)@xcite and sloan digital sky survey(sdss)@xcite depicted that our universe is spatially flat , with about seventy percent of the total density resulting from dark energy that has an equation of state @xmath0 and accelerates the expansion of the universe .",
    "several candidates to represent dark energy have been suggested and confronted with observation : cosmological constant , quintessence with a single field@xcite or with n coupled field@xcite , phantom field with canonical@xcite or born - infield type lagrangian@xcite , k - essence@xcite and generalized chaplygin gas(gcg)@xcite .",
    "one of the most important issues for dark energy models is the fine tuning problem , and a good model should limit the fine tuning as much as possible .",
    "the dynamical attractor of the cosmological system has been employed to make the late time behaviors of the model insensitive to the initial condition of the field and thus alleviates the fine tuning problem . in quintessence@xcite and phantom@xcite models ,",
    "the dynamical systems have tracking attractors that make the quintessence and phantom evolve by tracking the equation of state of the background cosmological fluid so as to alleviating the fine tuning problem .",
    "in addition , there are also two late time attractors in the phantom system corresponding to the big rip phase@xcite and de sitter phase@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", exponential potentials can arise from string/@xmath1-theory , e.g.via compactification on product spaces possibly with fluxes . in this case",
    ", the equations of motion can be written as an autonomous system , and the power - law and de sitter solutions can be determined by an algebraic method .",
    "the properties of the attractor solutions of exponential potentials can lead to models of quintessence @xcite . and",
    "general exact solution for double exponential potential with one exponent is the negative of the other for quintessence was presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the cosmological dynamics of barotropic fluid and scalar field with a double exponential potential and point out that the late - time asymptotic behavior does not always corresponding to the single - exponential case@xcite .",
    "we show that the existence of tracking attractor and de sitter attractor .",
    "we also find some heteroclinic orbits which mean solutions interpolate between different critical points .",
    "emphasis must be placed on that the tracking orbits have the similar but not exactly equal dynamical behavior and the initial possibilities consist in a wide range .",
    "we consider 4-dimensional gravity with barotropic fluid and a scalar @xmath2 which only depend on cosmic time @xmath3 .",
    "the scalar has a double exponential potential @xmath4    since current observations favor flat universe , we will work in the spatially flat robertson - walker metric .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion and einstein equations could be written as    @xmath5    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the density of fluid with a barotropic equation of state @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a constant that relates to the equation of state by @xmath10 .",
    "the overdot represents a derivative with respect to @xmath3 , the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are the energy density and pressure of the @xmath2 field respectively , and @xmath13 is the hubble parameter .",
    "phase space methods are particularly useful when the equations of motion are hard to solve analytically for the presence of barotropic density . in fact , the numerical solutions with random initial conditions are not a satisfying alternative because of these may not reveal all the important properties . therefore , combining the information from the critical points analysis with numerical solutions , one is able to give the complete classification of solutions according to their late - time behavior .",
    "similarly as in ref.@xcite , we introduce the following dimensionless variables @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "then , the eqs.([sys ] ) could be reexpressed as the following system of equations :    @xmath19 -[3x-\\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}(\\alpha_1 y^2+\\alpha_2 z^2)],\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{dy}{dn}&=&\\frac{3}{2}y[\\gamma(1-x^2-y^2-z^2)+2x^2]-\\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\alpha_1 xy,\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{dz}{dn}&=&\\frac{3}{2}z[\\gamma(1-x^2-y^2-z^2)+2x^2]-\\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\alpha_2 xz.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    also , we have a constraint equation    @xmath20    where @xmath21    different from the case in the single exponential potential , the parameter @xmath22 is dependent on @xmath2 : @xmath23    the equation of state for the scalar field could be expressed in terms of the new variables as    @xmath24    according to the eqs.([auto ] ) , one can obtain the critical points and study the stability of these points .",
    "substituting linear perturbation @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 near the critical points into the three independent equations , to first order in the perturbations , gives the evolution equations of the linear perturbations , from which we could yield three eigenvalues .",
    "stability requires the real part of all eigenvalues to be negative .",

    "critical points are always exact constant solution in the context of autonomous dynamical systems .",
    "these points are often the extreme points of the orbits and therefore describe the asymptotic behavior . if the solutions interpolate between critical points they can be divided into heteroclinic orbit and homoclinic orbit(closed loop ) .",
    "the heteroclinic orbit connects two different critical points and the homoclinic orbit is an orbit connecting a critical point to itself .",
    "if the numerical calculation is associated with the critical point analysis , then we will find all kinds of heteroclinic orbit , as show in figure.1 to figure.3 .",
    "the initial point is @xmath47 for all orbits since it is a repeller .",
    "especially , the heteroclinic orbit is shown in figure 2 , which connects the tracking attractor to @xmath48 . in figure 3",
    ", the heteroclinic orbit connects the de sitter attractor to @xmath48 .",
    "tracking behavior consists in the possibility to avoid the fine tuning of initial conditions , obtaining the similar behavior for a while range of initial possibilities . if we take cosmic time @xmath49 , the phase space contain a two - dimensional submanifold corresponding to set of initial possibilities .",
    "this initial submanifold consists with the intersection set of heteroclinic orbit and @xmath49 surface .    in figure 4 , we plot the dynamical evolution of matter , radiation and dark energy for the model with double exponential potential , in which tracker mechanism was used to provide a non - negligible energy density at early epoch@xcite .",
    "the dynamical evolution of equation of state @xmath50 vs @xmath51 are given in figure 5 .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the cosmological dynamics of scalar field with a double exponential potential .",
    "we show that the late - time asymptotic behavior does not always corresponding to the single - exponential case .",
    "furthermore , we study varied heteroclinic orbits including the tracking one .",
    "tracking behavior consists in the possibility to avoid the fine tuning of initial conditions .",
    "the numerical calculation show that the tracking orbits have the similar but not exactly equal dynamical behavior and the initial possibilities consist in a wide range .    why there are new features for double exponential potential ?",
    "first of all , the parameter @xmath22 here is dependent on the scalar field in contrast with single case .",
    "the second reason is that new features will occur in the regime where both exponential terms are remarkable .",
    "the third possible reason is that the heteroclinic orbits connect not only late - time but also early - time behavior .",
    "we can extend our discussion to the o(_n _ ) quintessence model@xcite , the initial energy density could be larger and would not affect the evolution too much because the angular kinetic energy decreases with @xmath52 . in a scalar field model ,",
    "tracker mechanism was used to provide a non - negligible energy density at early epoch . in the o(_n _ ) quintessence model , if equipped with the same tracker mechanism , it will admit a wider range of initial energy density@xcite .",
