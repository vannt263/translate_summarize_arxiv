    "a comparison between different numerical simulations shows that they are successful in reproducing the gross features of the cluster properties ( frenk et al .",
    "with increasing availability of computational power , numerical hydrodynamical simulations have been attempted to model the effects of radiative cooling on the gas in the formation and evolution of cluster galaxies ( katz & white 1993 ; suginohara & ostriker 1998 ; anninos & norman 1996 ; yoshikawa , jing , & suto 2000 ; pearce et al . 2000 ; lewis et al .",
    "2000 ) the numerical problems posed by the inclusion of gas cooling are challenging , mainly because the required increased spatial resolution also requires that one keeps under control two - body heating mechanisms .",
    "previous simulations have produced some conflicting results ( yoshikawa , jing , & suto 2000 ; pearce et al .",
    "2000 ) , thus the question of the minimum resolution in this kind of simulations is still to be fully settled .    in this contribution",
    "i will show the preliminary results that have been obtained from a series of hydrodynamical sph simulations of galaxy clusters .",
    "the simulations have different numerical resolution and include the effects on the gas component of radiative losses , star formation and energy feedback from sn .",
    "final profiles are compared in order to assess the effects of numerical resolution , or different star formation prescriptions , on the cluster x - ray variables .",
    "in a previous paper ( valdarnini et al . 1999 , hereafter vgb ) a large set of hydrodynamical simulations was used to study the global x - ray cluster morphology and its evolution .",
    "the simulations were run using a treesph code with no gas cooling or heating . in order to assess the numerical reliability of the numerical integrations , four different clusters were selected as a representative sample of all the simulation clusters . for this cluster sample a large set of different integrations was performed by varying two numerical input parameters : the number of particles and the softening parameters .",
    "i refer to vgb for a detailed description of the simulations . in valdarnini ( 2001 )",
    "i have used the same cluster sample to study the effects of including in the simulations additional physics such as gas cooling and star formation .",
    "i will report here the results for the cluster with label @xmath4cdm@xmath5 in vgb .",
    "this is the most massive cluster ( @xmath6 ) extracted from a cosmological @xmath4cdm n - body simulation with size @xmath7 , matter density @xmath8 and hubble constant @xmath9 . in order to check the effects of radiative cooling for this cluster a set of treesph simulations",
    "was performed , with initial conditions provided by the cosmological simulation , and different values of the gas softening parameter @xmath10 and number of gas particles @xmath11 . for this cluster table 1",

    "the cluster cl@xmath14 is the reference case without cooling .",
    "the effects of radiative cooling are modelled in these simulations by adding to the sph thermal energy equation an energy - sink term .",
    "the total cooling function includes contribution from recombination and collisional excitation , bremsstrahlung and inverse compton cooling .",
    "allowing the gas to cool radiatively will produce dense clumps of gas at low temperatures ( @xmath15 ) . in these regions",
    "the gas will be thermally unstable and will likely meet the physical conditions to form stars . in treesph simulations star formation ( sf ) processes have been implemented using different approaches . according to katz , weinberg , & hernquist ( 1996 , hereafter kwh ) a gas particle is in a star forming region if the flow is convergent and the local sound crossing time is larger than the dynamical time ( i.e. the fluid is jeans unstable ) . in a simplified version navarro & white ( 1993 ,",
    "hereafter nw ) assume as a sufficient condition that a gas particle must be in a convergent flow and its density exceeds a threshold ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "if a gas particle meets these criteria then it is selected as an eligible particle to form stars .",
    "the local star formation rate ( sfr ) obeys the equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gas density , @xmath19 is the star density , @xmath0 is a characteristic dimensionless efficiency parameter , @xmath20 is the local collapse time and it is the maximum of the local cooling time @xmath21 and the dynamical time @xmath22 .",
    "gas particles with @xmath23 have long cooling times and @xmath24 . at each step",
    "the probability that a gas particle will form stars in a time step @xmath25 is compared with a uniform random number .",
    "if the test is successfull then a mass fraction @xmath26 of the gas mass is converted into a new collisionless particle .",
    "this star particle has the position , velocity and gravitational softening of the original gas particle .",
    "typical assumed values are @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( kwh ) . for the local sfr , nw adopt eq . 1 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 when a gas particle can convert part of its mass into a star particle .",
    "the numerical tests have been performed following the nw prescriptions for selecting gas particles which can form stars .",
    "once a star particle is created it can release energy into the surrounding gas through supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "all the stars with mass above @xmath32 end as a sn , leaving a @xmath33 remnant .",
    "the sn energy ( @xmath34 ) is released gradually into the gas according to the lifetime of stars of different masses .",
    "the final radial gas density and temperature profiles are shown in fig .",
    "as can be inferred from table 1 , the numerical strategy has been to perform runs of increasing spatial resolution in order to resolve the core radius of the gas density profile .",
    "the most important result is that the inclusion of a star formation prescription has been effective in removing the cold gas particles ( @xmath23 ) from the cluster center . in all the simulations the gas density profiles have a well - defined core radius , with size @xmath35 , approximately @xmath36 of the virial radius @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the shapes of the temperature profiles show that convergence is achieved for @xmath39 .",
    "all the central values for the gas temperatures at @xmath40 are within a factor @xmath41 for the highest resolution simulation runs .",
    "the profiles increase inwards from the virial radius up to @xmath42 .",
    "thereafter the profiles stay almost flat , or with a modest decline in @xmath43 towards @xmath44 .",
    "there is not a strong drop of the temperature in the very central region .",
    "final x - ray luminosities are quite stable ( @xmath45 ) versus the simulation numerical resolution . compared to the non - radiative run the luminosities increase by a factor @xmath46 .",
    "a different question is the sensitivity of the estimated cluster properties to the numerical method used to describe star formation in the hydrodynamical simulations . to this end",
    "three simulations were performed with the same numerical parameters as for the cl@xmath47 run , but using different sf methods or parameters .",
    "the nw simulation ( i ) is the standard case showed in fig .",
    "1 . in the other two runs ( ii and iii ) the kwh prescription",
    "is adopted for converting gas particles into stars , but with different values of the star formation efficiency parameter @xmath0 :  @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "the most important differences are found between the kwh simulations with different @xmath0 .",
    "the differences are dramatic in the final x - ray luminosities , which differ by a factor @xmath50 .",
    "the source of this discrepancy relies in the different gas density profiles , which have substantial differences in the cluster core regions for @xmath51 .",
    "these differences are localized at the cluster center , beyond @xmath52 all the profiles converge , as it is shown in the plots of fig .",
    "the temperature profiles have a peak value of @xmath53 at @xmath54 and thereafter decline outward by a factor @xmath1 out to @xmath37 .",
    "below @xmath55 the profiles instead show large differences .",
    "compared to the nw run the simulation with @xmath28 has gas temperatures which decline inwards by a factor @xmath56 from @xmath57 down to @xmath58 .",
    "these radial decays follow because of the less efficient conversion of the cooled gas into stars compared to the nw run .",
    "there is a remarkable agreement for the ratio of cluster mass locked into stars to the gas mass , which is @xmath59 at @xmath37 for all the runs considered . in order to assess the effects of numerical resolution upon final results simulations i ,",
    "ii and iii have been run again but with a number of particles increased by a factor @xmath60 ( cl@xmath47h ) .",
    "these simulations will be referred as ih , iih and iiih , respectively .",
    "the simulation results are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "for simulations ih there are not appreciable differences in the radial profiles .",
    "this confirms the previous results , that is the nw runs have reached numerical convergence in the physical variables for the numerical parameters of the cl@xmath47 simulation of table 1 .",
    "the profiles of simulation iih are instead different from those of run ii at @xmath61 .",
    "the strong drop in @xmath43 has been removed and the gas density profile is much closer to the nw one .",
    "simulation iiih yields final profiles very similar to the ones of the parent simulation . the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "2 shows that high resolution runs have final x - ray luminosities which can differ within a factor @xmath1 from the parent simulations .    to summarize ,",
    "the above results demonstrate that simulations i and iii have an adequate numerical resolution to reliably predict x - ray cluster properties , such as the x - ray luminosity . for simulation ii ( kwh with @xmath28 )",
