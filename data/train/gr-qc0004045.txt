    "we describe in this paper precise conditions which allow to associate a four - dimensional manifold to a feynman diagram of a rank - four tensor theory .",

    "we try to keep our discussion as much as possible independent of dimension , but we only give precise conditions in dimension two , three and four .",
    "the result was actually previously known in dimension two and three , but the fact that we can give a unified treatment allows us to clarify better the specific conditions which we exhibit in dimension four .    to give an @xmath0-dimensional theory of euclidean quantum gravity one needs to define a path integral of the following form over equivalence classes of metrics : @xmath1 = \\sum_{m\\in { \\rm top}_n}\\ \\ \\int\\limits_{{\\rm riem}(m)/{\\rm diff}(m ) }            \\mathcal{d}[g ] \\;{\\rm e}^{-s_g[\\lambda , g ] }",

    "formal expressions like ( [ eq : zqg ] ) have demonstrated extremely powerful heuristic tools in theoretical physics but , as a matter of fact , they generally lack a proper definition . to actually give a definition one typically needs to be more specific and restrictive about the class @xmath6 of manifolds under consideration , and about the space @xmath2 of metrics .",
    "a possible strategy is to consider triangulated manifolds and to approximate path integration over inequivalent riemannian structures with summation over inequivalent triangulations of the manifold . here",
    "a triangulation @xmath7 is considered to define the _ singular _ riemannian structure in which all @xmath0-simplices are flat and have edges of a given length @xmath8 .",
    "the action takes the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of @xmath11-simplices in @xmath7 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are given as follows in terms of the volume @xmath14 of the flat @xmath11-simplex with edges having length @xmath8 : @xmath15 this approach is known as ` dynamical triangulation ' ( see  @xcite for discussion and references ) and the partition function @xmath16 $ ] is given by @xmath17 = \\sum_{m\\in { \\rm top}_n}\\        \\sum_{\\calt\\in { \\rm tria}(m ) }        \\;{\\rm e}^{-k_n \\nu_n(\\calt ) + h_{n-2 } \\nu_{n-2}(\\calt)}.\\ ] ] here @xmath18 denotes the set of triangulations , up to combinatorial equivalence , of a manifold @xmath3 , and the partition function is perfectly analogous to that of  ( [ eq : zqg ] ) .",
    "note that the sum over triangulations together with the sum over topologies corresponds to the sum over all @xmath0-dimensional simplicial complexes which are manifolds .",

    "i.e. _  we allow self - adjacencies and multiple adjacencies . ) note also that if in ( [ eq : zqg ] ) one wants to consider the action on @xmath19 of only those diffeomorphisms which are isotopic to the identity , then the discretized analogue again has the form of ( [ z : dt ] ) , except that each triangulation @xmath7 should now be weighted according to the number of non - isotopic ways it can be realized in the corresponding manifold .",
    "dynamical triangulations have been intensively investigated in two , three and four dimensions .",
    "it is of particular interest that in two dimensions the theory may be reformulated in terms of a matrix model  @xcite . in the perturbative approach to this theory ,",
    "the resulting feynman diagrams have vertices which correspond to two - simplices , and propagators which correspond to edge - pairings , so a diagram leads to a surface obtained by glueing triangles . in extending the triangulation strategy to arbitrary dimension one",
    "is brought to the search for theories having feynman diagrams in which vertices can be identified with @xmath0-simplices , and propagators with glueings of codimension-1 faces .",
    "if this happens then each feynman diagram gives an @xmath0-dimensional simplicial complex .",
    "generalized matrix models with feynman diagrams corresponding to simplicial complexes were discussed by sasakura @xcite , gross @xcite , boulatov @xcite , ooguri @xcite , and more recently by de pietri - freidel - krasnov - rovelli@xcite and others . however , in all these works a complete discussion of the topological properties of the resulting simplicial complexes is missing , and the results of the present paper allow to fill this gap .",
    "more precisely , it is the aim of the present paper to introduce a specific @xmath0-tensor model whose feynman diagrams can be identified with @xmath0-dimensional simplicial complexes , and to explicitly analyze the topological properties of these spaces .",
    "after a brief discussion of the two- and three - dimensional cases we address the four - dimensional problem . as a main result we provide an explicit criterion to decide whether the simplicial complex associated to a given feynman diagram is a manifold or not . when the criterion is fulfilled the value of a feynman diagram corresponds to the value of the discretized einstein - hilbert action of  ( [ eq : action : for : triangulation ] ) on the associated triangulation . in connection with the papers mentioned above",
    ", it is worth remarking here that the weight factor of model @xcite corresponds to the three dimensional ponzano - regge @xcite model and the one of model @xcite to the barrett - crane @xcite four dimensional relativistic spin model , while in our model each feynman graph is weighted by the simplicial action ( [ eq : action : for : triangulation ] ) .",
    "moreover , as consequence of remark [ circuit : rem ] , all these models can be seen as spin foam @xcite models .",
    "we review in this section the matrix model whose feynman diagrams lead to surfaces , then we introduce more complicated models which eventually will give higher - dimensional simplicial complexes .",
    "we set up a useful graphical encoding of the feynman diagrams , which will help us in describing how exactly a diagram leads to a simplicial complex .",
