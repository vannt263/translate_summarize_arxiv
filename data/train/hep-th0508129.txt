    "to calculate the correlation function ( 1 ) , we will use the semi - classical @xmath33 expansion .",
    "it was shown in [ 2 ] that , in the limit of large @xmath34 , the parameter @xmath33 plays the same role as planck s constant @xmath35 in the ordinary semi - classical approximation of quantum mechanics . in the leading order in @xmath34 , we need take into account only the contributions of planar gluon diagrams .",
    "this means that , in the path integral @xmath36 ( 3 ) , it is necessary to carry out summation over the subset of gauge fields whose contributions are greatest in this approximation .",
    "we use topological arguments to single out this subset of fields . in order that the semi - classical @xmath33 approximation be valid ,",
    "it is necessary to have a stable self - consistent extremal of the fields @xmath37 .",
    "studies in the field of instanton and soliton physics showed that stable field configurations in nonlinear field theories correspond to topologically nontrivial solutions of classical equations of motion .",
    "the variation of the action functional ( 8) , that is , the condition @xmath38 , gives the equation of motion @xmath39 the formal solution of this equation is @xmath40_{cd}{\\xi_d(0)},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is arbitrary .",
    "the ordered exponential function in ( 11 ) is defined on the contour @xmath42 and maps it into the @xmath2 group .",
    "this mapping is trivial for @xmath43 because the homotopic group @xmath44=0 $ ] .",
    "the only exception arises when a quasi - abelian field appears in expression ( 11 ) ; in this case , we are dealing with mapping of @xmath42 into the subgroup @xmath45 of the @xmath46 group .",
    "this mapping is nontrivial because we have @xmath47= z$ ] , where @xmath48 is the group of integers .",
    "further , the field ( 11 ) will be a true classical solution of equation ( 10 ) if it is single - valued on the closed contour @xmath42 .",
    "this leads to the quantization of the chromoelectric flux of the quasi - abelian field through an arbitrary surface @xmath49 with the boundary @xmath50 [ 3 ] .",
    "this flux quantization can stabilize the field configuration @xmath51 with respect to fluctuations if we are dealing with the full flux , and not with some part of the taken at random .",
    "because the contour @xmath42 forms a one - dimensional boundary , this condition can be satisfied for a quasi - two - dimensional field of the form @xmath52 which is defined on the surface @xmath49 with the boundary @xmath50 . here",
    ", @xmath53 and the equation @xmath54 determines the embedding of the surface @xmath49 into the flat space @xmath55 ( or @xmath56 in the euclidean formulation ) .",
    "thus , the topologically nontrivial configuration @xmath57,a\\}$ ] is realized only in the subset of quasi - two - dimensional fields @xmath58 and the semi - classical @xmath59 calculations should be restricted to the evaluation of contributions from this subset of fields ( 12 ) . in principle , there are contributions from other ( four - dimensional ) fields , but they do not give stable extremals in our problem .",
    "therefore , these contributions can not be calculated with the aid of the semi - classical expansion , and some other methods must be designed to accomplish these ends . however , there is independent evidence that , in the leading order of the strong - coupling approximation , the string tension is dominated by contributions from two - dimensional fields.this statement follows from a comparison of the string tension that is calculated in the hamiltonian formulation of the lattice gauge theory [ 4 ] with the result obtained by computing wilson loop in the yang - mills theory on arbitrary ( two- dimensional ) surfaces [ 5 ]",
    ". these results also coincide with the string tension ( 26 ) obtained in this study .",
    "the coincidence of these results shows that the semi - classical @xmath60 approximation includes the leading contributions to hadron correlators in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "so , if we take into account only contributions of fields type ( 12 ) , the calculation of the expectation value in ( 7 ) is reduced to integration with respect to the two - dimensional field @xmath61_{\\sigma}$ ] for a fixed surface @xmath49 and subsequent summation over surfaces @xmath49 .",
    "going over to the new variables , we obtain the effective two - dimensional action for each surface @xmath49 [ 6 ] .",

    "the condition @xmath69 gives the equation of motion @xmath70 for the field @xmath71 on the surface @xmath68 and the boundary condition @xmath72 on @xmath73 .",
    "the boundary condition takes into account the presence of quarks at the boundary of the surface . here",
    ", @xmath74 is the antisymmetric unit tensor , and @xmath75 is the operator of the quark color spin . by virtue equation ( 10 ) , the operator @xmath76 is a covariantly constant quantity .",

    "( 17 ) , the square of the vector @xmath80 equals the square of the quark color spin ; that is @xmath81 in a special gauge where @xmath82 the potential @xmath83 corresponding to ( 19 ) has the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the metric of the constant curvature @xmath86 on @xmath68 . substituting the self - consistent configuration @xmath87 into the action ( 14 ) and going over to the euclidean space , we reduce @xmath88 to the following form of the string action with constraints ( only in euclidean space above action has a right sign ) : @xmath89=&k_0\\int\\limits_{\\sigma}d^2z\\sqrt{h(x(z))}\\notag\\\\ & + \\frac{1}{2}\\oint\\limits_{\\gamma=\\partial\\sigma}d\\gamma\\left [ \\dot x^2(z(\\gamma))/\\lambda(\\gamma)+\\lambda(\\gamma)m_0 ^ 2\\right]+ { \\rm constraints } , \\label{25}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 the bare string tension is given by @xmath91 ( the string tension @xmath92 is renormalized as the result of subsequent summation over surfaces . in this procedure , the parameter @xmath93 is made to tend to zero ; this is equivalent to the removal of the cut - off and the introduction of the normalization point . ) in the limit @xmath94 , @xmath95 is independent of @xmath34 ; that is , we have @xmath96\\sim o(1)$ ] . the constraints that enter in formula ( 25 )",
    "ensure that our solutions will be the world - sheet instantons : a topologically nontrivial embedding of the world sheet in target space .",
    "the first constraint imposes condition of quantization on the string action ; that is , @xmath97 this condition is a corollary of the quantization of the chromoelectric flux on the world sheet @xmath68 .",
    "flux quantization follows from the requirement that the classical solution @xmath98 ( 11 ) defined on the closed contour @xmath99 be single - valued .",
    "the index @xmath100 in ( 27 ) determines the total increment of the phase of @xmath101 upon the circumvention along the contour @xmath15 .",
    "this index has the gauge invariant representation @xmath102 and characterizes various topological sectors . in the special gauge ( 22 ) , ( 23 ) , it assumes the simple form @xmath103    furthermore , it can be shown [ 3 ] that the gauge component of the action(14 ) is bounded from below , namely , @xmath104\\ge \\pi|q|",
    ". \\label{30}\\ ] ] as a result , the string field configuration @xmath105 turns out to be stable to small fluctuations of the gauge field that refer to a definite sector specified by @xmath100 .",
    "the second constraint is associated with condition ( 24 ) , which requires that the scalar curvature be constant .",
    "if condition ( 24 ) were not imposed , it would be possible to contract the boundary @xmath106 of the surface @xmath68 to zero by deforming the surface without changing the surface area @xmath107 .",
    "this would destroy the topological classification ( 27 ) with @xmath108 .",
    "moreover , condition ( 24 ) ensures the @xmath33 - suppression of gaussian fluctuations @xmath109 [ 7 ] .",
    "the solution of ( 23 ) expressed in terms of metric @xmath110 actually associates the spin connection on the surface @xmath68 with the vector potential @xmath111 or , which is equivalent , associates the curvature tensor with the strength tensor @xmath112}$ ] on @xmath68 .",
    "thus , in the approach developed here , the geometry of the string world sheet is determined by the dynamics of the gauge field on the same sheet .",
    "so , we have the manifestation of world - sheet instantons - topologically nontrivial embedding of the string sheet in outer space .",
    "in view of the quantization condition ( 27 ) , the partition function @xmath113 is decomposed into the sum of contributions from all topological sectors ; that is , we have @xmath114    the calculation of @xmath115 is carried out with the aid of the relation @xmath116\\circeq & \\int dx_\\mu dg_{ab}\\notag\\\\ & \\times \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_0}{2}\\int\\limits_{\\sigma}d^2z\\sqrt{g}g^{ab } \\partial_ax_\\mu\\partial_bx_\\mu\\right ) , \\label{33}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which holds only in the leading approximation of the of steepest descent .",
    "( the symbol @xmath117 means that the integral with respect to @xmath118 equals the value of the integrand taken at the saddle point . )    the calculation of the partition function @xmath48 by means of integration the conformal anomaly [ 8 ] with allowance for the constraints showed [ 9 ] that the partition function @xmath119 is expressed only in terms of the euler characteristic @xmath120 of the world sheet , that is , @xmath121 .",
    "\\label{34}\\ ] ] this means that , in the approximation used here , the @xmath2 gauge theory is reduced to a topological theory . the conformal anomaly proportional to the liouville action functional",
    "is neutralized by the condition @xmath122 : that is , there is no critical dimension @xmath123 .    in the calculation of @xmath48 ( 31 ) ,",
    "there arise divergences proportional to the surface area and perimeter of the world sheet .",
    "this enable us to renormalize the string tension @xmath92 and the quark mass @xmath124 [ 9 ] .",
    "the renormalized mass of a quark determines the geodesic curvature of the boundary @xmath106 ; that is , @xmath125 . in particular",
    "there is relation @xmath126 which is a characteristic of the beltrami pseudo - sphere , that is , our instanton wraps around noncontractible surface in target space that is pseudo - sphere .",
    "we also have the relation @xmath127 .",
    "thus , there is only one independent dimensional parameter , namely , the renormalized string tension @xmath128 its value can be determined by analyzing experimental data that concern distances @xmath129 on the order of the confinement radius ( @xmath130 ) . here , @xmath131 is the running coupling constant , and @xmath129 is the normalization point . in the nonperturbative analysis of a field theory that admits quark confinement , it is natural to use the renormalization scheme in which the string tension @xmath92 is fixed : @xmath132 ( the quantity @xmath133 plays a role here similar to that of the dimensional perturbative parameter @xmath134 ;",
    "these two quantities are related by a linear equation . ) from condition ( 37 ) and from equation ( 36 ) , it follows that the gell - mann - low function has the form @xmath135 this expression coincides with the first term of the expansion of the @xmath1-function in inverse powers of the charge @xmath136 in the strong - coupling approximation of the hamiltonian formulation of the lattice gauge theory [ 4 ] .",
    "this formulation is convenient because it permits the separation of contributions from electric and magnetic color fields . in the strong - coupling approximation ,",
    "the contribution of the electric field is dominant . at distances @xmath137 , where the charge is small",
    ", it is necessary to take into account the contribution of the magnetic field as well .",
    "numerical calculations showed [ 4 ] that , in this case , expression ( 38 ) goes over smoothly to the standard formulas @xmath138 [ 39 ] for @xmath139 in the weak - coupling approximation .",
    "the final stage of the calculation of hadron - field correlation functions is as follows [ 10 ] . in the approximation of scalar quarks ,",
    "the above functions are reduced to koba - nielsen dual resonance amplitudes in each topological sector .",
    "it turned out that the above - listed distinctions of the chromoelectric string from the standard model manifest themselves mainly in the calculation of the partition function and drop out , to a considerable extent , of final expressions for correlation functions .",
    "however , there is still a tachyon in the ground state in each topological @xmath100-sector .",
    "an infinite number of degenerate @xmath100-sector enables us to consider a new possibility for solving the long - standing tachyon problem in dual resonance models .",
    "namely , the introduction of the @xmath0-vacuum , which is a superposition of these sectors , is expected to result in a shift in the mass spectrum and lead to the elimination of the tachyon state from the theory .",
    "the solution of the equation of motion ( 10 ) according to ( 11 ) , ( 23 ) and [ 6 ] has a form @xmath140 where the phase @xmath141 does not depend on the index @xmath142 this being a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath2 symmetry to @xmath143 . the phase @xmath144 forms mappings @xmath145 , characterized by a winding number @xmath100 ( 28 ) , ( 29 ) .",
    "then we can construct the backgrounds ( pure gauge ) at the boundary @xmath15 for each sectors @xmath100 @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 because the our world - sheet instanton has topological index @xmath100=1 , it can makes the communication between next backgrounds . anticipating",
    "that some tunnelling does take place , the correct vacua will be linear combinations of the topological vacua and are given by @xmath149 it is equivalent to add the @xmath0 -term to the action [ 11 ] @xmath150 each tachyon for sector @xmath100 has the statistical weight is equal to ( for @xmath151 ) [ 9 ] @xmath152 @xmath153    the pre - exponential factor taking into account the contribution from gaussian fluctuations of gauge field around the instanton solution . according to [ 7 ] this factor is proportional to effective instanton area @xmath154 , where @xmath129-radius beltrami pseudo - sphere .",
    "the @xmath155 arise because of indistinguishability of instantons .",
    "let us regard the contribution of one tachyon pole in the dual resonance amplitude @xmath156 .",
    "it is equal to @xmath157 then one makes the transformation @xmath158 where we have came from minkovski area space @xmath159 to euclidean area @xmath160 . if we multiply this contribution by factor ( 47 ) and make the sum over all topological sectors with @xmath161 instantons and @xmath162 anti - instantons , we will get to result @xmath163 where @xmath164",
    "so , we have got the shift of the tachyon mass .",
    "let us stress also that @xmath0-term in ( 46 ) does not violate the parity symmetry because contains only the internal two - dimensional potential .",
    "also there is not any violation of the charge conjugation symmetry , because @xmath0-term contains charge squared according to ( 28 ) , ( 19 ) .",
    "in the leading order of the semi - classical @xmath33 expansion , the partition function and correlation functions are apparently dominated by the world - sheet instantons solutions .",
    "this ensures the string picture with quark confinement and introducing of the @xmath0-vacua .",
