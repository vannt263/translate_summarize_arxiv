    "in the last few years the contribution of cosmic vector fields to the curvature perturbation in the universe is under investigation .",
    "this effort was triggered by the pioneering work in ref .",
    "@xcite , which introduced the vector curvaton mechanism , through which vector boson fields can contribute to or even fully generate the curvature perturbation ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in analogy with the scalar curvaton mechanism @xcite , the vector curvaton is a spectator field during cosmic inflation , which becomes heavy after the end of inflation , when it can dominate ( or nearly dominate ) the density of the universe before its decay , thereby imprinting its contribution to the curvature perturbation @xmath0 .",
    "it was soon realised that , through their contribution to @xmath0 , vector fields can give rise to distinct observational signatures , namely produce statistical anisotropy in the spectrum and bispectrum of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this is a new observable , which amounts to direction dependent patterns on the cmb temperature anisotropies , which can be predominantly anisotropic in the bispectrum @xcite .",
    "such patterns can not be generated if scalar fields alone are responsible for the formation of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in view of the imminent observations of the planck satellite mission that may well observe statistical anisotropy , it is of paramount importance to investigate this effect and what it can reveal to us for the underlying theory . in particular ,",
    "if statistical anisotropy is observed by planck , we will have our first glimpse into the gauge field content of theories beyond the standard model .",
    "in general , one can divide the mechanisms that have been developed so far for the contribution of vector fields into @xmath0 in two classes .",
    "firstly , one can have an _ indirect _ influence of the vector field to inflation .",
    "one way to do this is by considering that the vector field develops a condensate , which generates anisotropic stress that renders inflation mildly anisotropic . in this case , the anisotropy in the expansion reflects itself onto the perturbations of the inflaton field , thereby generating statistical anisotropy in @xmath0 @xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "this anisotropisation of inflation is usually achieved by introducing some coupling between the vector field and the inflaton @xcite . alternatively , such coupling can backreact to the generation of the inflaton perturbations regardless of anisotropising the expansion @xcite .",
    "the other class of mechanisms which give rise to statistical anisotropy considers the _ direct _ contribution of vector field perturbations to @xmath0 .",
    "one way this can be done is through the vector curvaton mechanism mentioned above @xcite , where perturbations of the vector field perturb its energy density and , hence , the moment of ( near ) domination of the universe by the vector field condensate .",
    "statistical anisotropy in this case is due to the fact that vector fields undergo anisotropic particle production , in general @xcite .",
    "other mechanisms have been employed as well , such as the end of inflation mechanism @xcite .",
    "finally , one way to use directly the perturbations of vector fields to source @xmath0 is by considering a large number of them acting as inflatons as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "what do observations say about statistical anisotropy in the curvature perturbation ?",
    "the observed bound on statistical anisotropy in the power spectrum of @xmath0 is surprisingly low ; it seems that as much as 30% of it is still allowed .",
    "in fact , statistical anisotropy at this level was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite at the level of 9-@xmath1 ! however , the direction of the anisotropy was suspiciously close to the ecliptic plane so the authors of these studies conclude that the finding is probably due to some systematic mistake , hence being treated as an upper bound",
    ". the planck mission will reduce this bound down to 2% if statistical anisotropy is not observed @xcite .",
    "this means that the so - called anisotropy parameter , which quantifies statistical anisotropy in the spectrum of @xmath0 , must lie in the following range if it is to be observed in the near future : @xmath2    although , in principle , statistical anisotropy in @xmath0 can be scale dependent , a scale invariant spectrum of vector field perturbations results in scale - independent @xmath3 , which does not have to be fine - tuned such that it falls into the above range on the cosmological scales .",
    "moreover , even if eq .",
    "( [ grange ] ) is satisfied for cosmological scales , a strongly tilted spectrum would generate intense anisotropy , giving rise to excessive curvature perturbations ( e.g. leading to copious primordial black hole formation ) or destabilising inflation itself .",
    "thus , a ( nearly ) scale - invariant spectrum of vector field perturbations is preferred . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this can be naturally attained in certain types of theories .",
    "statistical anisotropy generates angular modulation of the power spectrum , but also of higher order correlators .",
    "moreover , even if the anisotropy in the spectrum satisfies the upper bound in eq .",
    ", higher order correlators can be predominantly anisotropic ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus important to study the effects of statistical anisotropy on higher order correlators @xcite as well as develop methods of detecting these effects in the cmb temperature perturbation @xcite .",
    "not many models exist as yet , for the formation of a superhorizon spectrum of vector field perturbations during inflation .",
    "the problem is rather old as it was investigated , at first , in order to generate a primordial magnetic field during inflation , with superhorizon coherence . a massless abelian vector boson field , such as the photon ,",
    "can not undergo particle production during inflation because it is conformally invariant .",
    "a breakdown of its conformality is , therefore , required in order to form the desired superhorizon spectrum of perturbations .",
    "modifications of the theory in order to attain such breakdown were originally investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , by coupling electromagnetism non - minimally to gravity .",
    "some of these proposals were recently implemented in the effort to generate a contribution of vector field to @xmath0 ; notably a non - minimal coupling to gravity of the form @xmath4 .",
    "such coupling was employed in ref .",
    "@xcite where hundreds of vector fields are used as inflations , and also in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the context of the vector curvaton model .",
    "however , this proposal was criticised for giving rise to ghosts @xcite ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another model , which does not suffer from instabilities , is considering the supergravity - inspired varying kinetic function for the vector field @xmath5 .",
    "the latter has been shown to give rise to a new inflationary attractor under fairly general conditions @xcite , which leads to scale - invariant vector field perturbations @xcite , when the kinetic function is modulated by the inflaton field .",
    "this model also has a long history , since it has been used to generate primordial magnetic fields too @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , it has been used to affect @xmath0 in the vector curvaton mechanism @xcite as well as the end of inflation mechanism @xcite .",
    "a third popular choice for primordial magnetic field generation during inflation is considering the axial term @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recently , some works have investigated the vector field backreaction onto inflation , if the axial coupling @xmath7 is modulated by a pseudo - scalar inflaton field .",
    "@xcite suggests that the axial term , can allow steep inflation with sub - planckian axion decay constant , evading thereby the basic problem of natural inflation @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the backreaction of the generated vector field perturbations onto the inflaton perturbations is shown to generate significant non - gaussianity in the latter .",
    "finally , the effects of the axial coupling onto gravitational waves is investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , which may provide parity violating signatures on the tensor modes and their effects onto the  cmb .",
    "parity violation is a special property of the axial model , compared to the other two mentioned above ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , which are parity conserving .",
    "what would it amount of if the vector field perturbations _ directly _ contributed to @xmath0 , e.g. through the vector curvaton mechanism ?",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite parity violation does not feature in the power spectrum of the density perturbations .",
    "however , in ref .  @xcite it was found that parity violation does affect the bispectrum of @xmath0 and it should reflect itself onto the shape and amplitude of the anisotropic @xmath10 . in this paper we present a complete study of the particle production of an abelian vector boson field featuring both a varying kinetic function and a non - trivial axial coupling .",
    "has been considered in refs .",
    "we obtain scale invariant parity violating spectra and we single out the conditions for their successful generation , providing some concrete examples based on particle theory . finally , we apply our findings onto the vector curvaton paradigm and find the generated @xmath3 and @xmath10 , which are to be contrasted with observations .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : anisotropic - fnl ] we present a brief review of the general case when a vector field contributes directly into the spectrum and bispectrum of @xmath0 . in sec .",

    "in this section we briefly summarize the results in refs .",
    "@xcite and calculate the anisotropic @xmath12 in the so called `` flattened '' shape for the first time .",
    "massive vector fields have three degrees of freedom . during inflation , after horizon exit quantum fluctuations of these degrees of freedom",
    "become classical perturbations . to deal with these perturbations",
    "it is convenient to use circular polarization vectors . as these vectors transform differently under rotations , lorentz invariance of the lagrangian guarantees that equations for the three polarizations",
    "are uncoupled .",
    "let us denote the power spectrum of left- and right - handed polarization modes by @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively and the longitudinal one by @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , expressions for the power spectrum and higher order correlators of the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath0 become much simpler expressed in terms of @xmath16 , which are defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 correspond to parity conserving and @xmath19 parity violating spectrum .",
    "the later is non - zero only if the left- and right- handed polarizations acquire different perturbation spectrum . calculating @xmath12 we will also find convenient to normalize spectra as @xmath20 if the @xmath21 and/or @xmath22 parameters are non",
    "- zero the vector field perturbation is statistically anisotropic .",
    "note that by definition the @xmath21 parameter can take values @xmath23 and the parity violation one @xmath24 .    to calculate the curvature perturbation @xmath0 we use the so called @xmath25 formalism .",
    "this formalism was generalized to include the perturbation from the vector field in ref .",
    "up to the second order it reads @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 and derivatives are with respect to the homogeneous values of fields . also , the summation over repeated spatial indices is assumed . in this equation",
    "we also assumed that the scalar field perturbation is gaussian , hence no second order terms in @xmath30 , and that scalar and vector field perturbations are uncoupled .    using the @xmath25 formula we can easily find the spectrum of @xmath0 at tree level @xcite",
    "can also be generated during weakly anisotropic inflationary expansion @xcite or inflationary models in non - commutative space - times @xcite . ]",

    "the scalar field contribution dominates .    the amplitude @xmath42 of the quadrupole modulation in the spectrum in eq .",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath43 from the last equation we see that a mildly statistically anisotropic vector field perturbation , @xmath44 , can generate the total curvature perturbation , that is @xmath45 with @xmath46 . then the observational bound on @xmath42 , discussed in the introduction , gives @xmath47 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath21 violates this bound , the vector field can generate only a subdominant contribution to @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath41 , in which case @xmath48 .",
    "note , that the curvature perturbation power spectrum @xmath49 is proportional only to @xmath21 but not @xmath22 .",
    "thus the possible parity violation of the vector field perturbation can not be detected in the spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "we need to measure higher order correlators for that .    in the present work we study the generation of @xmath0 by the vector curvaton scenario , in which @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be found to be @xcite @xmath52 with @xmath53 defined as @xmath54 in the above @xmath55 and @xmath56",

    "the parity violation of the vector field perturbation ( non - zero @xmath22 ) modulates the shape of @xmath12 by suppressing its value in the equilateral configuration and enhancing it in the flattened one .",

    "we see that    @xmath382    in this model . to have some time - dependence for the axion @xmath383 we need its mass to be comparable to the hubble parameter .",
    "thus , we consider modular inflation with and we assume that @xmath1 is an axion field , orthogonal to the qcd axion in supersymmetric realisations of the peccei - quinn symmetry , which employ a non - renormalisable superpotential for the peccei - quinn fields @xcite .",
    "this construction also solves the @xmath384-problem of supersymmetry .",
    "the superpotential is of the form @xmath385 where , with with @xmath386 being the peccei - quinn breaking scale given by @xmath387 where is the tachyonic soft mass of the radial field @xmath363 , which breaks the peccei - quinn symmetry .",
    "the above is obtained by minimising @xmath388 where @xmath389 is some density scale .",

    "if the radial field assumes its vacuum value ( i.e. it is not rolling down the radial direction ) then the axion mass becomes @xmath392    we assume that , during inflation , the axion is very close to the origin and rolls down near a local minimum approaching the origin . then we can write @xmath393 using the above , the axion s equation of motion is @xmath394 whose growing mode solution is @xmath395ht\\right\\ } \\propto a^{-\\frac{3}{2}\\left[1-\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{m_{\\sigma}}{h}\\right)^{2}}\\right]}.\\label{eq : orth - s - sol}\\ ] ] thus , if we denote @xmath396 from eq .",

    "( [ eq : n - def ] ) and ( [ eq : n - ansatz ] ) which suggest . if then , i.e. @xmath1 slow - rolls ( and ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 is practically frozen , in which case there is no parity violation .",
    "for this reason we do not consider that the radial field is still rolling with , neither do we assume that the tachyonic mass of the radial field is suppressed by some supergravity correction so that , as in ref .",
    "both these possibilities would result in .",
    "therefore , we should assume that the peccei - quinn symmetry is fully broken with and , such that , according to eq .  .",
    "the above imply that the mass of the physical vector field is @xmath398 thus , the longitudinal component of the vector field exists and , if it undergoes particle production , it will not obtain a scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "we need to check whether the longitudinal component spoils the model .    from eqs .",
    "and we find @xmath399 where stands for the weak scale ( gravitino mass ) and we considered that , at the end of inflation , .",
    "firstly , we need to verify that the field is light when the cosmological scales exit the horizon .",
    "the vector field becomes heavy ( and begins oscillating ) when .",
    "the earliest time for this to happen can be found by taking and in the above .",
    "we obtain , which corresponds to much later times than the exit of the cosmological scales .",
    "secondly , we need to ascertain that the vector field , after it begins oscillating , survives until the end of inflation at least , so that it can have some hope to affect the curvature perturbation in the universe .",
    "the decay rate of the vector field is .",
    "requiring that at the end of inflation produces the constraint @xmath400 this is a tight constraint for the gauge coupling and excludes large values of @xmath401 . using the above",
    ", we can estimate how close to the end of inflation the oscillations of the vector field begin .",
    "indeed , it is straightforward to find @xmath402 thus , in all cases the field becomes heavy and oscillates a few e - folds before the end of inflation , but it is always light when the cosmological scales exit the horizon .",
    "now , let us consider the particle production process for the longitudinal component . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found @xmath403^{2}}\\left(\\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\frac{h}{m}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\frac{k}{2ah}\\right)^{5 - 2\\hat{\\nu}},\\ ] ] where @xmath404 with and . using that , in this case , and we find , which gives @xmath405 as we have discussed , at the end of inflation , .",
    "thus , since we are considering superhorizon scales with , we see that , at the end of inflation . hence , even though , the scale invariance of the curvature perturbation is not spoilt because the contribution from the longitudinal component of the vector field is negligible compared with the transverse components , which are ( approximately ) scale - invariant .    in this model flat perturbation spectra for transverse modes",
    "will be produced if @xmath406 and @xmath220 ( c.f .",
    "subsection  [ sub : case - i ] ) .",
    "one can see from the definition of @xmath148 in eq .",
    "that @xmath407 .",
    "now , from eq .   with , we get .",
    "we also find , since , and . finally , because , the physical momentum at @xmath408 is as desired ( @xmath409 here denotes the remaining inflationary e - folds when ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath176 is also smaller than @xmath181 . since at the end of inflation , on superhorizon scales @xmath410 and @xmath411 we find @xmath412 .",
    "thus , we see that we do obtain scale - invariant spectra for the perturbations , which means that this model can be used to generate statistical anisotropy in @xmath0 . however , as discussed in the end of sec .",
    "[ sub : case - i ] , in this case , parity violating signatures are probably undetectable both in the power spectrum and in the bispectrum , whatever the value of @xmath155 .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that it is , in general , possible to employ an axial coupling for a vector field in order to generate scale invariant statistical anisotropy .",
    "there are two possibilities for this . in the first possibility , the only requirement is that , after horizon exit , the contribution of the axial term dominates the momentum term in the equation of motion for the transverse vector field components ( the longitudinal one , if it exists , is not affected by the presence of the axial term ) but still remains smaller than the hubble scale until the end of inflation . in this case , both transverse components obtain a scale invariant , superhorizon spectrum of perturbations of magnitude @xmath413 .",
    "if the field is massless then there is no longitudinal component ( it is decoupled from the theory ) so the anisotropy in the particle production is 100% , which means that the vector field has to contribute subdominantly to the curvature perturbation @xmath0 , as discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if there is non - zero mass , the longitudinal component is physical and has to be taken into account , in the way described in ref .",
    "the vector field can play the role of vector curvaton and produce statistical anisotropy in the spectrum and bispectrum of @xmath0 as in ref .",
    "it can also contribute to @xmath0 via another mechanism , e.g. the end of inflation mechanism @xcite .",
    "we have presented one example based on particle physics , where the axial coupling involves the so - called orthogonal axion , which is orthogonal to the qcd axion in supersymmetric realisations of the peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite . in this case , the axial contribution to the equations of motion is growing during inflation , while there is a longitudinal component which obtains a scale - dependent spectrum , that is subdominant to the scale invariant spectrum of the transverse components . however",
    ", this possibility does not produce any parity violating signatures in the bispectrum .",
    "in contrast , the second possibility can indeed generate a parity violating signature .",
    "this possibility corresponds to a decreasing contribution of the axial coupling to the equation of motion of the transverse vector field mode functions .",
    "this contribution has to take over the momentum term before horizon exit .",
    "the scenario can be realised only when the couplings @xmath94 and @xmath7 of the kinetic and the axial terms respectively are proportional to each other , with proportionality constant .",
    "then the power spectra of the transverse components are @xmath414 i.e. , where . as we have discussed , this possibility can be naturally realised in string theory , where @xmath94 and @xmath7 are determined by moduli fields .",
    "the parity invariant signature will affect the non - gaussianity by modulating the angular dependence of @xmath10 .",
    "if the planck satellite does detect statistical anisotropy and anisotropic non - gaussianity comparison between the different configurations ( e.g. equilateral , squeezed and flattened ) may well reveal the existence of a parity violating signal and provide evidence of an axial coupling in the vector field which will be needed to explain the statistical anisotropy .",
