    "using cosmological simulations of galaxy formation , @xcite show that a small fraction ( @xmath31 per cent ) of @xmath7 galaxies already formed at @xmath8 are expected to have grown in mass by less than 10 per cent since that epoch , i.e. they have remained essentially unaltered by mergers , accretion and star formation since @xmath2 .",
    "this number implies that , in the present - day universe , @xmath30.2 per cent of massive galaxies should be relic galaxies , with a number density of @xmath3@xmath9 .",
    "the observational search for @xmath0 massive relic galaxies has been inconclusive to date . @xcite and @xcite , using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , report only an upper limit of @xmath10 for the number density of massive relic galaxies up to @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast , @xcite , looking in clusters and including lower - mass galaxies , report a large number of massive relic candidates .",
    "the latter results raise the question of whether high - density environments ( where the sdss spectroscopic incompleteness is expected to be severe ) are particularly favourable for the conservation of massive relic galaxies .",
    "it is worth noting that our firmest candidate to be a genuine massive relic galaxy , ngc  1277 @xcite , inhabits the central region of the perseus galaxy cluster .",
    "this massive cluster is known for being the brightest cluster in x - ray emission of the sky @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",

    "they found that dark matter haloes like that of ngc  1277 are substructures of other more massive dark matter haloes .",
    "for dark matter haloes corresponding to the richest galaxy clusters , the fraction of sub - haloes similar to the dark matter halo of ngc  1277 can be as high as 30 per cent .    from the observational side , the location of old ( with luminosity ages > 9 gyr ) superdense galaxies as a function of the environment",
    "was explored by @xcite .",
    "using pm2gc @xcite and wings @xcite samples , these authors found that nowadays a significant fraction ( at least 17 per cent ) of these objects should be found in clusters .",
    "they also reported that this result was in agreement with the theoretical expectations derived from their own analysis of the millenium simulation .",
    "for instance , they found 36 per cent of the galaxies with @xmath12 and already passive at @xmath13 are members of clusters .",
    "understanding whether there is any preferential location for massive relic galaxies is key to have a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms responsible of the growth of the massive galaxy population with cosmic time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , understanding whether massive relic galaxies inhabit a particular type of environment is key to identifying the physical processes that prevented the size evolution of these objects .    in this paper we provide a new determination of which environment is most favourable for massive relic galaxies .",
    "we improve over previous works by conducting a simultaneous analysis of the predictions from numerical simulations and observational data , using the same methodology for characterizing the environment around massive galaxies .",
    "in addition , we work with baryonic galaxies instead of just dark matter haloes . given the low number density of massive relic galaxies in the present - day universe , we use one of the currently largest @xmath14-body cosmological simulation : the millennium i-__wmap__7 ( mi7 ; * ? ? ? * ) , and we extend the mass range of the search to lower masses ( @xmath1 ) : there is no reason to believe relics only exist above @xmath7 , and the change improves the statistics that can be extracted from the simulations and the observational data .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : sim - cat ] we describe our numerical galaxy catalogue , we state the definition of which galaxies will be considered as relics in the simulations ( section  [ subsec : sim - relics ] ) , and how we have identified galaxy clusters into them ( section  [ subsec : sim - clusters ] ) . in section  [ sec : obs - cat ] we introduce our observational catalogue , and define which galaxies will be considered relics within this catalogue ( section  [ subsec : obs - relics ] ) . in section  [ sec : env - def ] we detail the procedure that we use to characterize the environment of the galaxies in both frameworks ( simulations and observations ) .",

    "we define a @xmath0 relic in the simulation as a galaxy that has barely increased its stellar mass since @xmath2 . in order to identify the possible candidates to relic galaxies in our numerical catalogue , we use the merger tree structures to trace backwards in time the massive galaxies identified at @xmath0 , together with two conditions .    1 .",

    "* ) to identify the possible candidates to be a virialized galaxy cluster in the sample .",
    "the basic concept of this technique is to find spherical regions with an average density above a certain threshold , which can be fixed according to the spherical top - hat collapse model .",
    "therefore , we can define the virial mass of a halo ( @xmath29 ) as the mass enclosed in a spherical region of radius ( @xmath30 ) having an average density @xmath31 times the critical density @xmath32 : @xmath33    the over - density @xmath31 depends on the adopted cosmological model , and can be approximated by the following expression @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36/[\\omega_\\mathrm{m } ( 1 + z)^3 + \\omega_\\lambda]$ ] . depending on the different cosmologies , typical values of @xmath31 can vary between 100 and 500 . for the particular choice of cosmological parameters of this paper , the value of @xmath31 obtained using equation  ( [ eq : deltac ] ) is @xmath37 .    in our particular implementation of a spherical over - density finder , and given the fact that we do not consider total masses but stellar masses , we use @xmath31 to define a virialized region that has a stellar average density 350 times the average stellar density in the whole computational domain .",
    "for these computations , we consider the stellar masses from massive galaxies ( i.e. those above @xmath38 ) . with these conditions ,",
    "we look for the galaxy whose spherical region has the highest average density .",
    "if this quantity divided by the average stellar density in the whole simulation is above the threshold @xmath39 , we define this region as a galaxy cluster .",
    "the procedure is repeated looking for the next galaxy whose associate sphere has a environmental density fulfilling the density threshold condition and non - overlapping with previously identified clusters .",
    "the procedure goes on until no candidates to galaxy cluster satisfying the conditions are left . once all the galaxy clusters are identified , we characterize them by computing their velocity dispersion ( @xmath40 ) using the relative velocities with respect to the cluster centre of mass for all the galaxies in the cluster .",
    "our sample of real galaxies is obtained from the new york university value - added galaxy catalogue ( hereinafter nyu - vagc ; * ? ? ?",

    "selection biases of the sdss spectroscopic catalogue affecting nearby , high - surface brightness galaxies have been carefully studied by @xcite . specifically , they analysed the effects of the star / galaxy separation criterion , the ` saturation ' selection limit and the ` cross - talk ' selection limit . for the range of redshift of our sample ,",
    "the most important effect is the ` cross - talk ' selection limit . to first order ,",
    "these selection biases are independent of environmental density , and consequently it is not expected that they affect our observational results . nevertheless , and in order to show the robustness of these results",

    "identifying a relic galaxy in the observations is less straightforward than in simulations , as we have poor information on the merger and the star - formation histories of real galaxies . using the criterion that a relic galaxy should not have undergone star formation since @xmath2 and",
    "should not have evolved structurally since those redshifts , we require three conditions to classify a galaxy as a candidate relic :    1 .",
    "its stellar population is old : equivalent single - stellar - population ( ssp ) age above 10 gyr .",
    "its structure is early - type : with srsic index @xmath48 .",
    "3 .   it is compact : its size must be close to stellar mass  size relationship of early types at @xmath2 .    to identify old galaxies , we select the reddest galaxies in the rest - frame colour  colour diagram @xmath50 versus @xmath51 .",
    "we base our colour cut using a ssp model with age 10 gyr and metallicity @xmath52 .",
    "the values adopted for this ssp were taken from the photometric predictions based on miuscat spectral energy distributions @xcite .",
    "hence , we require @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "additionally , and in order to minimize the contamination of dusty galaxies in our sample of relic galaxies , we reject the most asymmetric objects on the sky , i.e. those with a ratio between minor and major axes lower than 0.3 , because they are the most probable candidates to be galaxies with dusty discs .",
    "we will expand about the contamination of dusty galaxies and the effectiveness of our rejection criteria on the discussion exposed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the structural requirements derive from the properties of massive galaxies at high redshift .",
    "many works have shown that massive galaxies have grown with cosmic time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , being the size evolution stronger for early - type galaxies .",
    "furthermore , stellar mass ",
    "size scaling relationship seems to have a constant slope with cosmic time .",
    "this result has been reported by @xcite up to @xmath55 , finding that the major - axis radius @xmath56 is proportional to @xmath57 with @xmath58 for early - type galaxies .",
    "in the nearby universe the exponent is just slightly shallower .",
    "@xcite found that nearby early - type galaxies ( i.e. with srsic index @xmath48 ) are well described by a scaling relationship between their effective radii and stellar masses of the type @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "taking advantage of the stronger global size evolution of early - type galaxies with cosmic time , we select our candidates for being relic galaxies as those objects with old stellar populations and srsic index @xmath18 above 2.5 located in the lower region of the stellar mass  size plane . in particular , we define this lower region to contain 5 per cent of the whole sample of galaxies with the smaller sizes at a each stellar mass .",
    "this means we consider as compact galaxies those with sizes below @xmath61 being @xmath62 and @xmath63 the effective radius in the @xmath64 band .    , while the two solid black lines show the region populated by the galaxies labelled as normal - sized in the same section .",
    "in addition , we have represented the galaxies with different colours depending on their srsic indices as indicated in the legend . ]",
    "we define a comparison sample of normal - sized galaxies by taking all galaxies between the 47.5 and 52.5 percentiles of the distribution @xmath65 of the whole sample ( i.e. without any restriction on srsic - index ) .",
    "they are the galaxies which are between two lines in the stellar mass  size plane of the form of equation  ( [ eq : re ] ) with values of @xmath66 equal to @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in fig .  [",
    "fig : obs - mass - size ] we show how compact and normal - sized definitions are reflected in the stellar mass  size plane .",
    "the same procedure is used to define environmental density in the simulations and in our real - galaxy catalogue . following a similar prescription to",
    "that described in @xcite , we define the environmental density around each galaxy as follows : for each galaxy we identify all its neighbours with masses above @xmath47 within a sphere of radius @xmath69 , and define the environmental density as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the stellar mass of the @xmath72th neighbour located at less than @xmath73 of the @xmath74th galaxy of the sample ( galaxy @xmath74 has @xmath75 neighbours ) .",
    "the selected radius of @xmath69 is a compromise between having a local measurement of the density and at the same time having a volume large enough to guarantee that there is a significant number of galaxies above the stellar mass completeness limit so we can compute a sensible density around our targeted galaxy .",
    "although the same formal definition is used for both frameworks , density values from simulations and observations can not be directly compared to each other . in the case of the real - galaxy catalogue , because the line - of - sight coordinate is inferred from the redshift , high - density virialized regions will be stretched along the line of sight ( fingers - of - god effect ) hence equation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) provides a lower - limit to the actual physical density .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the computed densities for real galaxies have been proved to be a useful proxy to trace overdensities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to emphasize this difference",

    "this number of relic galaxies corresponds to an extremely tiny fraction of today galaxies with @xmath4 : 0.04 per cent . this value is lower than the measurement reported by @xcite , where they found that the number of present - day massive relic galaxies is 0.06 per cent when they used our same catalogue ( from *",
    "we have checked that the above difference is only due to the higher mass cutoff ( @xmath77 ) of the @xcite sample .",
    "we now direct our attention to the number of relic galaxies in clusters in the simulations . by using the method described in section  [ subsec : sim - clusters ] , we identify 672 rich galaxy clusters . within these clusters ,",
    "we find 47646 massive galaxies and 87 relics ( i.e. 0.18 per cent of them ) .",
    "consequently , despite that the simulation has 8.5 times fewer relic galaxies in clusters than in the field , it follows that the probability for a massive galaxy to be a relic is 4.6 higher in clusters than in a global search of the population of massive galaxies .      to make the analysis more quantitative , we explore the distribution of massive galaxies ( relic and not ) as a function of the environmental density as defined in equation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) . the distribution of @xmath78 for the galaxies in the simulation is shown in fig .",

    "this result points in the same direction as the above findings , where we report that the fraction of relics is higher in clusters .      in this section",
    "we explore how the massive ( relic or not ) galaxies are distributed according to the velocity dispersion of the clusters ( i.e. a proxy of the galaxy cluster global mass ) .",

    "we now shift our attention to the observational catalogue , and enquire on the abundance and environmental density distribution of relic galaxies . out of the 41716 massive galaxies in the catalogue",
    ", we find 463 galaxies classified as relics according to the criteria described in section  [ subsec : obs - relics ] .",

    "the main reason for this difference is the fingers - of - god effect , which was already expected from the reasons exposed when we presented our procedure to estimate the environmental density in section  [ sec : env - def ] .",
    "in addition , the large difference between the volumes of observational ( @xmath84 ) and numerical ( @xmath85 ) catalogues contributes to the difference in maximum densities .",
    "also contributing must be the spectroscopic redshift incompleteness of the sdss : the sdss spectroscopic catalogue is claimed to be @xmath399-per - cent complete down to @xmath86 @xcite .",

    "horizontal lines are used to show the fraction of each type of galaxy without considering any @xmath76 binning ( in particular , solid blue / green dash  dotted / red dotted line corresponds to the fraction of normal - sized / normal - sized early - type / relic galaxies ) .",
    "[ fig : obs - fraction - env ] reveals that the fraction of relic galaxies is a monotonic increasing function of the environmental density .",
    "in contrast , galaxies with average sizes in the stellar mass  size relationship are equally distributed as a function of the environmental density , even when we focus only on normal - sized early - type galaxies . the increasing trend shown by the relic galaxies in fig .",
    "[ fig : obs - fraction - env ] would be probably more accentuated if sdss were not affected by incompleteness .",
    "the reason is that this incompleteness is more important in the centres of the galaxy clusters due to fibre collision problems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the trend shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : obs - fraction - env ] obviously depends on the size @xmath73 of the fixed - aperture sphere considered in the definition of the environmental density . in this work",
    "we have considered @xmath88 .",
    "we checked that for radii bigger than 2 @xmath24  the trend disappears , while it is weaker ( but still present ) for 1 @xmath24 . as the size of the sphere for characterizing the environmental density increases our ability to describe the local conditions also decreases .",
    "consequently , we can conclude that the physical conditions for maintaining the galaxies in their initial ( relic ) configuration are linked with the local ( i.e. sub - cluster ) scales .",
    "both the simulation and the observational data compiled in this work lead to the same conclusion : massive ( @xmath4 ) relic galaxies can be found in all kind of environments ; however , their relative fraction increases with the environmental density .",
    "according to the simulations the difference in the relative fraction of relic galaxies in clusters compared to the field can be as high as 4.6 .",
    "the results that we find in this work suggest that the local environment plays a major role in determining when a massive galaxy formed at @xmath89 is not going to evolve much since its formation .",
    "it is particularly relevant for this discussion that , in the simulations , the location of relic galaxies in clusters peaks towards the central parts .",
    "the central regions of clusters are also expected to form and virialize early , indicating that the mechanism necessary for the subsequent growth of massive galaxies was slowed down very early on .",
    "the centres of the clusters , particularly the most massive ones , are characterized for having a large velocity dispersion and also a very hot intracluster medium .",
    "these conditions prevent an effective mechanism for mass ( and size ) growth of the galaxies .",
    "if the picture drawn here is correct , the right places to find a significant number of massive relic galaxies are on the centre of the clusters .",
    "observationally , to claim the detection of a genuinely relic galaxy is not easy .",
    "one has to guarantee that the stellar populations are old throughout the entire structure of the galaxy and this is observationally very demanding .",
    "so far , this study has been only conducted in ngc  1277 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this massive and compact galaxy is very closely located towards the centre of the very rich perseus cluster .",
    "the argument of the previous paragraph focused on how the clusters can help to prevent the galaxy growth and the _ rejuvenation _ of its stellar population through star formation .",
    "nevertheless , due to hierarchical evolution we could also expect that relics prefer clusters . since relic galaxies are a subset of galaxies which were formed first ( by definition ) , they have had more time to cluster than galaxies formed later .",
    "we have to take into account that even in this scenario , the key to the survival of these relics resides in the large velocity dispersions and the hot intracluster medium .",
    "we would like to point out that the previous interpretation includes our observational findings under the assumption that high - density environments should correspond in their majority to clusters .",
    "this is justified as several works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that the aperture - based methods are a good proxy for the halo mass and , consequently , for selecting cluster environments .",
    "comparing our results with previous ( observational and numerical ) works , we find a nice agreement . as commented in the introduction ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) , @xcite , simulating the dark matter component only , also obtain in the bolshoi simulation , an increasingly large number of relic galaxies inhabiting the most massive galaxy clusters . from the observational side ,",
    "@xcite find a large number of massive and compact galaxies in clusters .",
    "the first clues indicating that relic galaxies should be searched in clusters were given by @xcite .",
    "in the nearby universe , they observed that at least 17 per cent of old ( with luminosity ages > 9 gyr ) superdense galaxies should be found in clusters . using the millenium simulation",
    ", they found 36 per cent of today galaxies with @xmath90 and already passive at @xmath13 are members of clusters . in our work ,",
    "12 per cent of the relics from the simulations are part of rich clusters , while in the observations 10 per cent of the relics fall in the highest @xmath76 bin ( cf .",
    "[ fig : obs - fraction - env ] ) .",
    "hence , we broadly coincide with @xcite in finding a significant fraction of relics in clusters .",
    "the quantitative differences between the fractions inferred in the two studies , and between the fractions inferred from observations and from simulations in each study , are to be expected from differences in the adopted definitions of relic and environmental density .",
    "the reason why @xcite and @xcite failed to identify relic galaxies in the sdss appears to be the more stringent mass ( @xmath91 ) and compactness constraints used in their search : the galaxy mass function drops steeply at these masses , and catalogues simply have fewer galaxies with @xmath91 .",
    "the known spectroscopic incompleteness of sdss towards the centre of the clusters also contributes to the negative result reported in the above two papers .",
    "in fact , when the stellar mass and size of the galaxies are a little bit relaxed , a good number of candidates for being relic galaxies based on the velocity dispersion of the objects is found .",
    "it will be worth exploring the environment of relic galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "many recent works have characterized the number density of massive relic galaxies against redshift @xcite .",
    "the next step in this direction is to probe whether the relative abundance of those intermediate - redshift relic galaxies is higher in denser environments .",
    "the findings in the present paper predict that they will be .",
    "a very recent work by @xcite seems to support this prediction .",
    "could the dependency of the relic fraction with environmental density have been inferred from trends of the stellar mass  size relationship with density ?",
    "we do not think so .",
    "the variation with environment and redshift of the stellar mass  size relationship for early - type / quiescent galaxies has been studied ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their distributions , characterized by parameters such as mean / median or standard deviation , contain insufficient information about the bottom tail of the distributions for characterizing the relic fraction .",
    "we refer in section  [ sec : obs - cat ] to the incompleteness of the sdss spectroscopic catalogue in nearby massive galaxies studied by @xcite .",
    "these authors warn about biases against massive compact galaxies at low redshifts ( @xmath92 ) . here",
    "explore whether the trends outlined in this paper might be the result of such biases . to that effect",
    ", we split our sample in two redshift ranges : @xmath92 where bias effects might be higher , and @xmath93 where bias effects are expected to be weaker or non - existent . from the observational volumes of each of the two sub - samples",
    ", we estimate that we could be missing approximately 140 galaxies in the low - redshift range due to these biases .",
    "the strongest source of bias comes from saturation limits and hence from high surface brightness ; it must show very little dependency on environment , and hence there is no reason for expecting that the missed relics show a different environment distribution than the galaxies of our sample .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the effects of this bias on the trends of relic fraction with density must be very small . but even if all of the 140 missed galaxies would live in @xmath94 environments , we find that the observational trend of a higher fraction of relics in higher - density environments remains .",
    "additionally , we note that incompleteness in the sdss spectroscopic catalogue is in fact expected to be higher in clusters due to fibre proximity limits",
    ". the effect of such biases would be to dilute , rather than strengthen , the trends found in this paper .",
    "additionally , we would like to comment that we also checked the dependence of our results on the method that we have used to identify clusters in the simulations .",
    "in particular , we have also extracted the list of haloes with stellar masses larger than @xmath95 using an fof method in the millennium simulation . in this case , the number of relic galaxies in the clusters detected by the fof method is totally comparable to the one found by the method used in this work ( described in section  [ subsec : sim - clusters ] ) .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the contamination of dusty galaxies in the observational relic sample should be tiny . as it was explained in section  [ subsec : obs - relics ] , due to the unavailability of infra - red data to reject the dusty galaxies , we decided to exclude from our sample the most asymmetric objects in the sky in order to avoid including galaxies which potentially could contain edge - on dusty discs . applying this filter",
    ", we rejected 13 galaxies . assuming a random orientation of the dusty discs in the sky , and taking into account that the ratio between minor and major axes used in our filter is 0.3 , we should have rejected around 70 per cent of the dusty discs .",
    "this means that within the considered sample there should be around six face - on dusty discs , which is a small fraction of our sample of relic galaxies .",
    "it is also worth noting that this method is conservative , and therefore it overestimates the contamination .",
    "furthermore , we would like to mention that the inclusion of the potentially edge - on dusty galaxies does not change the observational results shown in this work .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "cosmological simulations predict that the fraction of present - day relic galaxies with @xmath4 is only 0.04 per cent .",
    "this number is 4.6 higher when the galaxies are located in cluster environments : 0.18 per cent .",
    "moreover , it seems that this fraction could be even larger in the most massive clusters with large velocity dispersions ( although the statistical significance of this last result is marginal ) .",
    "2 .   the distribution of the relic galaxies in the simulation within the clusters is not homogeneous .",
    "in fact , they tend to be located a factor of 2 closer to the central parts of the clusters than the other massive galaxies . these very dense regions slow down the physical mechanisms for the mass growth of the galaxies .",
    "observationally , in agreement with the simulations , we also find that the fraction of relic galaxies increases as their surrounding densities rise .",
    "these conclusions point in the same direction as previous works : the article by @xcite , which reported the preference of old ( with luminosity ages > 9 gyr ) superdense galaxies to inhabit in clusters ; and the article by @xcite , which found that dark matter haloes like that of the relic ngc  1277 are substructures of other more massive dark matter haloes .",
    "the authors are grateful to the referee for his / her useful and constructive review .",
    "the authors thank a.  vazdekis and i.  martn - navarro for their collaboration during the development of this paper .",
