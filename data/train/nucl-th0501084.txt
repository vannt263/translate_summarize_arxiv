    "the elastic scattering of light heavy - ions at intermediate energies has clearly demonstrated the sensitivity at large angles to the underlying optical potential through the `` appearance '' in the angular distribution of airy oscillations associated with nuclear rainbow scattering @xcite .",
    "such studies pin down several aspects of the optical potential , usually constructed through the double - folding procedure . among these aspects , we mention the degree of non - locality , genuine energy - dependence , the density dependence of the effective nucleon - nucleon g - matrix , etc .    recently , the elastic scattering of halo - type nuclei , such as @xmath3li , @xmath1he , @xmath3be , @xmath4c , at intermediate energies has been studied . in such cases , due to the low beam intensity , it is rather difficult to cover the airy region . thus , at most , one is bound to extract from the small angle , near / far interference , region , information about the strength of the coupling to the break - up channel .",
    "the energy dependence associate with non locality of the local equivalent optical potential has a paramount importance in such studies .    in this work ,",
    "we discuss the elastic scattering of stable , weakly bound and exotic nuclei on a variety of targets , both light and heavy , in order to assess the energy - dependence . for this purpose",
    ", we use the so paulo potential and the lax interaction discussed in details in refs .",
    "@xcite . in section",
    "ii , we give an account of the optical potential and its energy - dependence . in section iii",
    ", we present the data analysis .",
    "finally , in section iv , we present a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "two different phenomena , called pauli non - locality ( pnl ) and pauli blocking ( pb ) , are important to understand the energy - dependence of the optical potential for heavy - ion systems . the pnl arises from quantum exchange effects and has been studied in the context of neutron - nucleus @xcite , alpha - nucleus @xcite and heavy - ion @xcite collisions .",
    "the nonlocal interaction has been used in the description of the elastic scattering process through an integro - differential equation @xcite .",
    "it is possible to define a local - equivalent potential which , within the usual framework of the schroedinger differential equation , reproduces the results of the integro - differential approach @xcite . in the case of heavy - ion systems , the real part of the local - equivalent interaction",
    "is associated to the double - folding potential ( @xmath5 ) through @xcite : @xmath6 where _",
    "@xmath7 _ is the speed of light and _ @xmath8 _ is the local relative velocity between the two nuclei .",
    "this model is known as so paulo potential .",
    "the velocity / energy - dependence of the potential is very important to account for the data from near - barrier to intermediate energies @xcite .",
    "( 1 ) describes the effect of the pnl on the real part of the potential , but the local - equivalent potential that arises from the solution of the corresponding integro - differential equation indicates that the exchange correlation also affects the imaginary part of the optical potential @xcite .",
    "another model used in the analyzes of elastic scattering data is the lax interaction @xcite , which is the optical limit of the glauber high - energy approximation @xcite .",
    "the lax interaction is essentially a zero range double - folding potential used for both the real and imaginary parts of the optical potential .",
    "similar to the so paulo potential , the lax interaction is also dependent on the nuclear densities and may be expressed in terms of the relative velocity between the two nuclei .",
    "the imaginary part of the lax interaction is thus written as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an energy - dependent spin - isospin - averaged total nucleon - nucleon cross - section .",
    "( 2 ) has been derived from multiple - scattering theories and should be valid for stable ( non - exotic ) nuclei at high energies . for lower energies , eq .",
    "( 2 ) must be corrected in order to take into account the closure of the phase space due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "this phenomenon , known as pauli blocking ( pb ) , can be simulated in eq .",
    "( 2 ) by introducing a further dependence of @xmath11 on the densities of the nuclei @xcite .",
    "usually , the pb is expected to be essential at small internuclear distances due to the corresponding large overlap of the nuclei .",
    "since the pb can distort significantly the densities in the overlap region , it should affect both the real and imaginary parts of the optical potential .    in this work",
    ", we have assumed these two semi - phenomenological models for the real ( eq",
    ". 1 ) and imaginary ( eq .",
    "2 ) parts of the optical potential .",
    "we have analyzed several elastic scattering angular distributions for systems with reduced mass between 3 and 34 . as extensively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be used in several different frameworks that provide very similar results in data analyzes . in the present work ,",
    "we use eq .",
    "( 1 ) within the zero - range approach for the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction ( @xmath12 ) with the matter densities assumed in the folding calculations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is equivalent @xcite to the more usual procedure of using the m3y nucleon - nucleon interaction with the nucleon densities of the nuclei . for @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we have interpolated values from the corresponding experimental results of ref .",
    "table 1 presents all systems that have been analyzed in the present work .",
    "the data have been obtained from refs .",
    "@xcite . eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) involve the folding of the nuclear densities . in an earlier paper @xcite , we presented an extensive systematics of heavy - ion densities . in that work , the fermi distribution was assumed to describe the densities .",
    "the systematics indicates that the radii of the matter distributions are well represented by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of nucleons of the nucleus .",
    "the densities present an average diffuseness value of @xmath15 fm . owing to specific nuclear structure effects ( single particle and/or collective )",
    ", the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 show small variations around the corresponding average values throughout the periodic table . in the present work ,",
    "we have assumed eq .",
    "( 3 ) for all nuclei and allowed @xmath17 to vary around its average value in order to obtain the best data fits .",
    "the only exception is the @xmath0he nucleus for which the shape of the corresponding matter density was assumed to be similar to the charge density obtained from electron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "of course , the use of a fermi - type density is not well justified for light , both stable and unstable , nuclei .",
    "however , we decided to use this universal form in order to assess the adequacy and limitations of our model .",
    "the values obtained for the diffuseness of the nuclei are shown in table 2 . in a consistent manner , these values present very small variations around the average value obtained in the previous systematics : @xmath15 fm .",
    "we emphasize the much greater value obtained for the diffuseness of the exotic @xmath1he in comparison with its partner @xmath0he . indeed , the diffuseness of the @xmath1he is comparable with the values obtained for heavy - ions .",
    "similar results have already been observed in other works @xcite .",
    "table 2 also presents the root - mean - square ( rms ) radii for the matter densities and for charge distributions extracted from electron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "the rms radii for the matter densities agree with the values for charge distributions within about 5% , except for @xmath18c where a difference of 10% was found .    for the imaginary part of the optical potential we have adopted eq .",
    "( 2 ) , without pb , multiplied by a factor of normalization @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding predictions for some elastic scattering angular distributions are shown in figs .",
    "( 1 - 3 ) . in these figures ,",
    "the dashed lines represent the predictions with @xmath20 while the solid ones correspond to the results obtained considering @xmath19 as a free parameter .",
    "the best fit values obtained for @xmath19 are presented in table 1 and fig .",
    "a strong reduction of absorption is observed for systems with small reduced mass .",
    "as already commented in section i , pnl and pb affect both real and imaginary parts of the optical potential .",
    "the detected reduction of absorption could partially arises from the effect of the pb . in order to illustrate this point , fig .",
    "( 5 - bottom ) shows @xmath21 obtained from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , for the @xmath18c + @xmath18c system in two different energies , with ( solid lines ) and without ( dashed lines ) including the effect of pb .",
    "the calculation of @xmath21 with pb was performed considering a density - dependent nucleon - nucleon total cross section according refs .",
    "@xcite . clearly , the blocking reduces @xmath21 in an internal region of distances and almost no effect is observed in the surface region .",
    "this behavior is connected with the large overlap of the densities for small distances that makes the blocking very effective . in fig .",
    "( 5 - top ) we show the results of a notch test , where we have included a spline with gaussian shape in the imaginary potential and calculated the variation of the chi - square as a function of the position of this perturbation .",
    "this test has the purpose of determining the region of sensitivity that is relevant for the elastic scattering process . just as a guide ,",
    "the position of the s - wave barrier radius is also indicated in the same figure . in the region of sensitivity ,",
    "the imaginary potential with pb is in average less intense than the result without blocking .",
    "this fact probably is connected with the value @xmath22 obtained for the @xmath18c + @xmath18c system . still in fig .",
    "( 5 ) one can observe that the region of sensitivity is more internal for the higher energy .",
    "however , the difference between @xmath21 with and without blocking is smaller for the higher energy",
    ". probably , this two effects cancelate each other and one obtains approximately the same @xmath19 value for the two energies ( see table 1 ) . in fig .",
    "( 6 ) we present the reaction cross sections for the @xmath18c + @xmath18c system in a very wide energy range ( from refs .",
    "the lines represent the predictions obtained with @xmath20 and @xmath23 , where the smaller value was obtained from the elastic scattering data fits .",
    "clearly the value @xmath23 also provides a better reproduction of the reaction data in the energy region studied in this work : @xmath24 mev / nucleon that corresponds to @xmath25 mev for @xmath18c + @xmath18c .    in fig .",
    "( 7 ) , we present the notch test for systems with different reduced masses , but for approximately the same bombarding energy .",
    "again as a guide , the positions of the corresponding s - wave barrier radii are indicated in the figure . for the heaviest system ,",
    "the region of sensitivity is close to the barrier radius and therefore it is in the surface region .",
    "the lighter systems present sensitivity regions much more internal in comparison with the corresponding barrier radii .",
    "in fact , it is well known that the scattering between light heavy - ions probes more efficiently the internal internuclear distance region @xcite and the present results of the notch test just confirms this point .",
    "thus , the simple approach of using eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , with @xmath20 , fails for lighter systems that are sensitive to inner distances .",
    "the discussion about fig .",
    "5 clearly shows that the effect of pb on the imaginary part of the potential should be partially responsible by this behavior of light systems , but the present analysis can not discern if such behavior is also connected with effects of pnl on the imaginary part and/or even of pb on the real part of the optical potential . on the other hand , considering our results for heavier systems , the analysis clearly indicates that the surface region of the optical potential is well represented by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , real part that includes the pnl effect , and eq . ( 2 ) ,",
    "imaginary part without the pb effect .    in order to check the consistency between the present and earlier works ,",
    "we have calculated the volume integral of the real part of the potential , eq . 4 , and the reaction cross sections that are connected with the absorptive part of the potential .",
    "@xmath26 the values obtained for @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( see table 1 ) are similar to those of earlier works ( from refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present systematics we have included the weakly bound @xmath2li nuclei and also the exotic @xmath29he . in some works , due to the break - up process or effects of the halo ,",
    "these projectiles have been pointed out as responsible by a different behavior in comparison with nuclear reactions involving only normal stable nuclei .",
    "in fact , our systematics for @xmath19 also indicates a slightly greater absorption for systems involving @xmath2li in comparison with other systems with similar reduced masses ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as already commented , the diffuseness obtained in this work for @xmath1he is much greater than the value extracted for @xmath0he from electron scattering experiments .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed elastic scattering angular distributions for several systems .",
    "the real part of the optical potential was assumed to be energy - dependent due to the pnl that arises from quantum exchange effects .",
    "for the imaginary part , we have adopted the lax interaction that also presents an energy - dependence very well established and connected with the total nucleon - nucleon cross section . in the imaginary part ,",
    "we have also considered a factor of normalization with the aim of simulating the effect of pb , which arises from the exclusion principle and prevent scattered nucleons to occupy filled states .",
    "the notch test indicated that lighter systems present greater sensitivity to the internal region of internuclear distances , where pb is expected to be essential due to the large overlap of the nuclei . for heavier systems it was possible to obtain a good data description with @xmath20 .",
    "this result indicates that , in the surface region , the pnl and pb does not significantly affect the imaginary part of the potential , while eq .",
    "( 1 ) correctly describes the pnl effect on the real part . for lighter systems , however , reasonable accounts of the data were obtained only considering @xmath19 as a free parameter .",
    "this result is compatible with the expected reduction of the absorption due to pb and also with the fact that light nuclei have a smaller density of states .",
    "the present analysis , however , can not discern if such behavior is also connected with effects of pnl on the imaginary part and/or even of pb on the real part of the optical potential .",
