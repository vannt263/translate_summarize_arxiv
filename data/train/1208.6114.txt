    "stars condense out of cold dense clumps of molecular gas called prestellar cores which appear to be located in much larger clouds , often filamentary in shape .",
    "while the formation of stars themselves is relatively well understood , a number of questions such as the distribution of stellar masses or even the formation of prestellar cores remain amongst the unsolved questions in contemporary astronomy .",
    "it was commonly believed that stars belonged to larger clusters populated with several tens of other members ( e.g. palla 2005 ) , but the belief is now contested by more recent observations of dozens of clusters ( e.g. guttermuth _ et al . _ 2009 ) .",
    "a better understanding of the processes leading to the assembly of potential star - forming gas probably holds the key towards unravelling issues fundamental to the theory of star - formation .",
    "primarily , they are related to the mode of star - formation , in other words clustered as against isolated or a mixture of the two .",
    "the origin of the stellar imf , its universal nature and the possible relation with the distribution of core masses is another issue that has baffled researchers .",
    "also a related question is that about the time - scale on which a mc is likely to form stars . for a more detailed discussion of these points the interested reader",
    "is referred to hartmann _",
    "( 2011 ) and bonnell _ et al . _",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "furthermore , observations in a number of wave - bands , and in particular , the molecular lines at sub mm - wavelengths have now demonstrated the turbulent interiors and the non - uniform distribution of gas within molecular clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "in fact , a significant fraction of molecular gas appears to reside in dense filamentary regions ( e.g. , elmegreen 1997 , nutter _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 , andr _ et al .",
    "however , numerical simulations over the last decade have demonstrated with considerable success the tendency of turbulent gas to generate filamentary structure on a relatively short timescale , usually smaller than a sound - crossing time ( e.g. , klessen _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , jappsen _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 amongst a number of other works ) . though turbulence provides support against self - gravity on a global scale , locally , on scales comparable to the length of driven modes , it assembles gas that can eventually become self - gravitating which probably explains star - formation within larger filamentary structures .",
    "young protostars compete with each - other to acquire mass from their natal pool , a scenario better - known as competitive accretion ( bonnell _ et al .",
    "evidently the formation of these dense filaments and their possible fragmentation depends on the prevalent physical conditions within the parent mc .",
    "numerical simulations by ballesteros - paredes _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) , heitsch _ et al . _",
    "( 2008 ) , and anathpindika ( 2009 a , b ) amongst those by several other authors , have shown that dense filaments of gas form rapidly via fragmentation of larger pressure - confined gas bodies that may form due to collisions between turbulent flows .",
    "the fragmentation itself is a result of a process called gravoturbulent fragmentation , an interplay between the gravitational instability and hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "these simulations have shown that the star - formation process , beginning with the assembly of gas in dense pockets , once triggered , proceeds rapidly due to the non - linear growth of instabilities .",
    "however , the fact that a mc probably spends considerable time in a relatively quiescent state before star - formation is triggered , according to some authors supports the hypothesis of slow star - formation ( e.g. , krumholz & tan 2007 ) .",
    "mcs in astrophysical environments though , are also exposed to ionising radiation ( ir ) , which is likely to profoundly affect their evolution and possibly trigger new episodes of star - formation .",
    "large nebulae such as the rossette nebula ( e.g. white _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; poulton _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 ) , the eagle nebula with its famous pillars of creation and trunks ( e.g. sugitani _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) , the m17 nebula ( e.g. hoffmeister _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 ) , the star - forming cloud ngc7538 ( e.g. ojha _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) , the nebula sfo38 in ic1396 ( choudhary _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 ) , and cometary globules such as ic1848 ( e.g. lefloch _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , and cg12 ( haikala & reipurth 2010 ) , are just a few examples of star - formation triggered by the ir .",
    "the rosette mc , for instance , is irradiated by the nearby star - cluster ngc2244 and the radiation induced turbulence appears to have generated a network of filaments within the main cloud .",
    "more recent observations of the rosette mc using the multi - waveband infrared cameras , pacs and spire , on - board the herschel space - observatory have revealed young star - forming regions in the junctions of these filaments ( schneider _ et al .",
    "_ 2012 ) .",
    "secondary star - formation , i.e. , cases of new episodes of star - formation triggered by the flux of ir emitted by an earlier generation of stars have also been reported in for e.g. , the orion mc ( wilson _ et al .",
    "another prognosis , observed sometimes in regions of triggered star - formation , is the increasing age of stellar population along a certain direction , also called the sequential mode of star - formation ( e.g. , maaskant _ et al .",
    "_ 2011 ) . hot radiation from young stars is therefore believed to play a crucial role in controlling the rate of galactic star - formation , and furthermore , it is also an important source of turbulence in galactic disks ( e.g. andrews & thompson 2011 ; krumholz & matzner 2009 ) .    over the last three decades several authors have studied analytically the likely fate of mcs irradiated by a strong flux of ir .",
    "dyson ( 1973 ) , for example , suggested flattening of an irradiated cloud , whereas according to bertoldi ( 1989 ) and bertoldi & mckee ( 1990 ) , an irradiated cloud was more likely to implode under the influence of a radiation driven shock - wave within the cloud , a phenomenon known as _ radiation driven implosion_. the cloud so accelerated was shown to acquire a cometary structure with a characteristic velocity of the order of a few km / s .",
    "stars could form within this comet - shaped globule ( cg ) . indeed , a number of such globules have been observationally reported as cited above . the formation of cgs due to the rdi has been demonstrated numerically for small dense clouds by for instance , lefloch & lazareff ( 1994 ) , and more recently by bisbas _",
    ".    dale _ et al . _",
    "( 2007 ) , on the other hand , showed that the exposure of a massive self - gravitating , turbulent mc to a flux of strong ir significantly reduced the gas - to - star conversion efficiency . while these authors considered only one choice of the strength of ir , in the present study we will consider three choices ranging from a weak to a fairly strong flux , similar to that emitted by a typical young star - cluster .",
    "the different strengths of flux are acquired by varying the temperature of the source of ir and the rate of photon - emission , as recorded in table 1 .",
    "we will then compare the evolution of an irradiated , turbulent cloud with that of a similar cloud allowed to evolve only under self - gravity ( and no ir ) . of particular interest",
    "is the spatial distribution of dense pockets of gas within the mc in each realisation .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we shall begin by briefly discussing the expected fate of irradiated mcs for different choices of gas density .",
    "the numerical scheme adopted for this work will be described briefly in  3 , and the simulations will be discussed in  4 before results are formally presented in  5 .",
    "we will conclude in  6 .",
    "the physical situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , where the projection ( on the plane of the sky ) of the cloud facing the external source of radiation , s , and located a distance @xmath2 from s have been shown . the flux of ir , @xmath3 , received by a small area element on the surface of the cloud as that shown by the small shaded portion in fig . 1 , located at a distance @xmath4 from the source , s , is @xmath5 where higher order terms involving @xmath6 have been neglected as @xmath7 in general .",
    "the force , @xmath8 , exerted by this flux of ir on the cloud is then @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the speed of light , @xmath11 , the average number density of ionised gas and @xmath12 , the second recombination coefficient defined as @xmath13^{1/2}}\\phi_{2}(\\beta)\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3 } \\mathrm{s}^{-1}.\\ ] ] in the equation above , @xmath14}$ ] , @xmath15 is the equilibrium temperature of the ionised gas , and @xmath16 is the second recombination coefficient ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "( @xmath17= 1 , for a fully ionised gas ) .    using eqn .",
    "( 1 ) , the expression for @xmath8 above becomes @xmath18 note that the denominator in this expression for radiation - force has units of velocity that may be interpreted as the rate at which the ionisation - front advances .",
    "as expected , the force becomes vanishingly small at large distances , @xmath19 .",
    "equation ( 3 ) for the force exerted by the flux of incident radiation permits us to define the momentum , @xmath20 , delivered by this flux to the gas within the cloud ; @xmath21 for a molecular cloud composed of the usual cosmic mixture the average mass of gas particles within it , @xmath22 = 4@xmath23 g. if the irradiated cloud loses gas at roughly constant velocity , @xmath24 , then the rate of mass - loss , @xmath25 , for this cloud can be obtained by applying the conservation of momentum to the mass lost , m@xmath26 , so that @xmath27 the expression of the mass - loss rate here assumes that the density , @xmath28 , within the cloud is uniform and that there is no secondary loss of the ir - flux due to absorption by dust within the cloud . in a real cloud",
    "though , a fraction of the incident flux would be lost towards heating the dust within the cloud .",
    "the heated dust will of course , re - emit in infrared wavebands .",
    "the assumption of a pristine cloud devoid of any dust , however , is unlikely to alter significantly the order - of - magnitude estimate provided by eqn .",
    "the timescale , @xmath29 , over which an irradiated cloud is likely to survive is simply , @xmath30    using eqn .",
    "( 4 ) we calculate the mass lost by irradiated clouds of different average densities , @xmath28 , over their respective free - fall times .",
    "the results of a demonstrative calculation performed for a photon - ionised gas of average density , @xmath31 10 @xmath32 , and maintained at an equilibrium temperature , @xmath15= @xmath33 k , have been plotted in fig .",
    "the test cloud for each choice of flux - strength was kept at a distance @xmath2 from the source such that @xmath34= 0.01 .",
    "starting from the lowest characteristic upward , the average gas density within a cloud , @xmath28 , increases by an order of magnitude .",
    "the three green vertical lines for the respective choice of @xmath35 divides the characteristics into survival - regions , i.e. , the range of ir - fluxes that a cloud can possibly endure .",
    "the minimum mass of a cloud that can survive without being photoevaporated by the incident radiation - flux is defined by the intersection of these vertical lines with the characteristics on the plot .",
    "small rarefied clouds sit leftward of the vertical line for @xmath36 s@xmath37 and therefore , are likely to be photo - evaporated even by a relatively weak flux of ir .",
    "denser and more massive clouds , to the right of this line , will be steadily photo - evaporated by a stronger flux .",
    "photoablation is therefore the likely fate of progressively larger clouds exposed to a flux of ionising radiation .",
    "some of the more massive clouds occupy the top right - hand corner of the plot to the right of the vertical line for @xmath35 = 10@xmath38 s@xmath37 , and evidently need stronger fluxes before they can start losing their mass .",
    "the test cloud used in the simulations below ( @xmath39 @xmath32,@xmath40 = 1 pc ; see  3.4 below ) , lies on the characteristic just below the uppermost in the region between the fluxes corresponding to 10@xmath41 s@xmath37 and 10@xmath38 s@xmath37 , and therefore , is expected to steadily photo - ablate .",
    "in fact , the mass - loss rate for this test cloud according to eqn.(4 ) above is a few times @xmath42 m@xmath1 yr@xmath37 for @xmath43 s@xmath37 , and @xmath44 0.08",
    ". the mass - loss rate for this cloud suggests , it is likely to survive at least an order of magnitude longer than its free - fall time .    ,",
    "relative to the source of ionisation , @xmath45 .",
    "the amount of flux received by the shaded area element on the surface of the cloud is given by eqn .",

    "<S> prevalent physical conditions within a mc play a crucial role in determining the mode , i.e. , filamentary as compared to isolated pockets , of star - formation , the timescale on which stars form and the distribution of stellar masses . </S>",
    "<S> the probability density functions ( pdfs ) derived for irradiated clouds in this study are intriguing due to their resemblance with those presented in a recent census of irradiated mcs . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , irrespective of the nature of turbulence , the protostellar mass - functions(mfs ) derived in this study follow a power - law distribution . when turbulence within the cloud is driven by a relatively strong flux of ir such as that emitted by a massive o - type star or a cluster of such stars , the mf approaches the canonical form due to salpeter , and even turns - over for protostellar masses smaller than @xmath00.2 m@xmath1 .    </S>",
