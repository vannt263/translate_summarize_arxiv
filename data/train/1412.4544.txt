    "noise is omnipresent in all natural systems and plays a beneficial role in the dynamics of nonlinear systems yielding interesting results  @xcite .",
    "there are many studies which have revealed that noise can play a constructive role like noise induced order in chaotic dynamics  @xcite , stochastic  @xcite and coherence resonances  @xcite .",
    "noise can be divided into two categories : extrinsic and intrinsic .",
    "the extrinsic noise can originate from the environment  @xcite and an external noise generator in experimental systems , whereas intrinsic noise is generated due to an interplay between the components of the systems and could be of small amplitude .",
    "but at sufficiently large values this intrinsic noise can also affect the deterministic dynamics of the system . of particular interest",
    "is the phenomenon of stochastic resonance  @xcite ( sr ) in which the addition of random noise amplifies the pre existing subthreshold deterministic signal and has been observed in many systems such as physical  @xcite , chemical  @xcite , electronics  @xcite , biological  @xciteand numerical model like fitzhugh  nagumo ( fhn )  @xcite .",
    "coherence resonance  @xcite ( cr ) , which is also called autonomous sr or internal signal sr , is an emergence of regularity in the dynamics under the influence of purely stochastic perturbations . in cr",
    ", the maximum regularity is achieved at an optimum noise amplitude which has been observed in many experimental systems : optical  @xcite , electrochemical  @xcite , chemical reactions  @xcite , electronic monovibrator circuit  @xcite as well as in numerical simulation of the standard model like fitzhugh  nagumo ( fhn ) model  @xcite , thermochemical system model  @xcite .",
    "the most important characteristic of cr is that the time scale of induced oscillations is determined by the intrinsic dynamics of the system .",
    "plasma being a nonlinear and a complex medium with numerous free energy sources which are expended by giving rise to several instabilities  @xcite which in turn interact to produce a background plasma noise of broadband nature ranging from low frequency ion acoustic modes to high frequency electron plasma oscillations .",
    "the common sources of intrinsic noise in experimental systems also include the plasma fluctuations  @xcite , photons and fast neutrals in the system  @xcite .",
    "though they are small , they are widely used in estimating the plasma temperature and other parameters .",
    "the theme of this paper is to explore the effects of this kind of noise in generating coherent spikes when plasma is treated to be an excitable medium .",
    "there are several research works on the external noise induced dynamics in the plasma system  @xcite as well as reports on the observation of cr in glow discharge plasma under the influence of external noise perturbation  @xcite but we have observed the same phenomena without any application of external noise .    in this paper , we present experimental investigations on intrinsic noise induced dynamics in a glow discharge plasma .",
    "power spectrum and normalized variance ( nv ) have been used to analyze the time series of floating potential fluctuation .",
    "we have also estimated that the intrinsic noise level increases with the discharge voltage ( dv ) and hence conjecture that it could be playing a vital role in the observation of the cr phenomena as seen by the dip in the nv plot .",
    "the resonance phenomena has been also verified using the hurst exponent and power spectrum . to understand the experimental observations ,",
    "a fhn like model derived from an anharmonic oscillator equation for ion acoustic oscillations is considered .",
    "since our experimental results reveal that the intrinsic noise plays a role in the dynamics of the system , we included in the numerical model a forcing term consisting of a bias and a gaussian noise . the gaussian noise is understood to play the role of the intrinsic noise present in the experimental system .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : in section ii , we describe the experimental setup , followed by the results of the analysis of the floating potential fluctuations using normalized variance , hurst exponent and power spectrum plot in section iii . in section iv , we looked for a similar effect , i.e. cr phenomena , in a fhn like model .",
    "conclusions and summary of the results are presented in section v.",
    "the schematic diagram of the hollow cathode dc glow discharge plasma device  @xcite is shown in fig . [ setup ] .",
    "it has a cylindrical cathode of length and diameter @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath1 respectively and a central anode rod of diameter @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "the operating pressure was about @xmath5 @xmath6 and the discharge voltage could be varied from @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "the floating potential fluctuations were measured using a langmuir probe connected to an oscilloscope .",
    "+    the typical value of electron temperature , ion temperature and density are estimated to be approximately @xmath9 @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xmath10 and @xmath12 @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the glow discharge plasma can exhibit a wide variety of nonlinear phenomena depending upon the choice of operating pressure and discharge voltage ( dv ) . for the purpose of the present experiments",
    ", we started the system at a discharge voltage @xmath14 @xmath15 where it exhibited fixed point behavior , and then the dv was increased monotonically and floating potential fluctuations were recorded .    fig .",
    "[ expraw](a - j ) shows the time series of the floating potential fluctuation at different values of dv as mentioned in the caption of the figure .",
    "the dynamics of the time series show that the system behaves as an excitable one , presenting characteristic spiking for values of dv when it exceeds a threshold .",
    "it is also seen from the fig .",
    "[ expraw](a - j ) that the number of the spikes continuously increases with the increase in dv .",
    "the approximate values of the rise and the fall time of the spikes are 0.12 msec and 0.22 msec respectively .",
    "these time scales are comparable with the ion transit time scale ( @xmath16 @xmath14 0.1 msec , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , m and @xmath19 are the electrode distance , boltzmann constant , ion mass and ion temperature respectively . ) between two electrodes .",
    "so probably these spikes correspond to bunches of ions excited from the anode .",
    "+    the normalized variance ( nv ) was used to quantify the regularity in the spikes .",
    "it is defined as nv = std(isi)/mean(isi ) , where isi is the time elapsed between successive spikes .",
    "it is evident that the value of the computed nv will be lower for the more regular induced dynamics . for purely periodic dynamics ,",
    "the nv will be zero .",
    "[ enor ] is the experimental nv curve as a function of dv .",
    "higher value of nv at dv 481 v indicates the irregular nature of the spikes .",
    "it is seen that nv decreases with the increase in the dv indicating the enhancement in regularity and maximum regularity is achieved at dv @xmath14 488 v. further increase in dv leads to irregularity in the system .",
    "the minima in nv curve suggests that the phenomena is similar to coherence resonance . generally , noise is responsible for the cr so we have estimated the intrinsic noise level with the help of wiener filter subroutine in matlab .",
    "[ noise ] shows the intrinsic noise level as a function of dv depicting the enhancement in the intrinsic noise level with the increase in dv . as the intrinsic noise level increases with dv , it is clear that the regularity of the excitable spikes in the floating potential fluctuation increases with the increase in the noise level , upto an optimal value of the noise strength .",
    "+     +    the estimation of characteristic correlation time @xmath20 using normalized autocorrelation function has been shown as one of the measures of coherent behavior  @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of a maxima in the @xmath21 vs noise amplitude curve at the point of maximum regularity has been reported for the coherence resonance phenomena  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the hurst exponent can also be used as a measure of temporal correlation .",
    "hence , to further characterize the coherence resonance behaviour , we evaluated the hurst exponent estimated using rescaled range analysis ( r / s ) method  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath22 and @xmath23 indicates the random , anti - correlated , correlated and periodic nature of the time series signal respectively .",
    "the dependence of the hurst exponent on the dv and noise strength is shown in fig .",
    "the nature of the h vs dv curve has an opposite trend with respect to nv vs dv curve .",
    "the plot clearly shows the coherence resonance maximum at dv @xmath14 488 indicating the maximum temporal correlation at a particular discharge voltage and hence at a particular value of noise strength",

    "the difference between the original fhn model and our present equation is the presence of the quadratic term .",
    "although there is no explicit externally applied noise present in the experimental system , we consider the situation where noise is generated intrinsically . in order to investigate the behaviour of the nonlinear oscillations in the presence of an external discharge voltage , we include an additional biasing term @xmath46 and a noise term @xmath47 on the right hand side of eq .",
