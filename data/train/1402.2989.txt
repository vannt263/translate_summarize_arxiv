    "<S> we report quantitative measurements of the impact of alloy disorder on the @xmath0 fractional quantum hall state . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the @xmath0 state is suppressed with alloy scattering . to our surprise , in samples with alloy disorder the @xmath0 state appears at significantly reduced mobilities when compared to samples in which alloy disorder is not the dominant scattering mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> our results highlight the distinct roles of the different types of disorder present in these samples , such as the short - range alloy and the long - range coulomb disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> unraveling the impact of disorder is an important endeavor in contemporary condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> disorder is well understood in the single particle regime . </S>",
    "<S> examples of fundamental importance are anderson localization @xcite and universal plateau - to - plateau transition in the integer quantum hall effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> localization in the presence of the disorder is also important in topological insulators @xcite and in atomic condensates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , understanding disorder in correlated electron systems continues to pose serious challenges . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay of disorder and interactions has witnessed renewed interest in the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in connection to the stability of the exotic fractional quantum hall states ( fqhs ) @xcite and in graphene due to the observation of a wealth of fqhss using local detection @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the fqhs at landau level filling factor @xmath0 is one example of a correlated ground state which has attracted considerable attention @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is because of the putative exotic pfaffian - like correlation in the ground state at @xmath0 and of the non - abelian quasiparticle excitations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> non - abelian quasiparticles may be used to realize topological qubits , building blocks of fault - tolerant quantum computers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since the pfaffian can be mapped into a paired wavefunction with a @xmath4-wave symmetry @xcite , the @xmath0 fqhs is intimately connected to @xmath4-wave superconductors @xcite , majorana physics in superconductor - semiconductor hybrid devices @xcite , and superfluid @xmath5he @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the disorder on the @xmath0 fqhs remains largely unknown @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> disorder is a key factor in limiting @xmath6 , the energy gap of the @xmath0 fqhs , to less than 0.6  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of this state must therefore be conducted at either dilution or nuclear demagnetization refrigerator temperatures , which render these studies time consuming @xcite . however , in the disorder - free limit @xmath6 is predicted to be as high as 2  k at the typical electron density of @xmath7@xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> understanding disorder in the @xmath0 fqhs is thus expected to lead to an increased energy gap with the following benefits toward fundamental tests of the nature of this state : a ) experiments may be conducted at higher temperatures , possibly in @xmath5he refrigerators , with shorter turn - around times allowing for extensive investigations b ) improved signal - to - noise ratio in experiments on nanostructures in which the edge states of the @xmath0 fqhs are probed @xcite and c ) exponentially enhanced topological protection in qubits @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> studies of disorder require the capability of its control . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we report on a quantitative inquiry of the impact of a specific type of short - ranged disorder , alloy disorder , on the @xmath0 fqhs . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated a series of specially engineered samples in which all parameters but the alloy disorder remain constant by design @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we measured al@xmath9ga@xmath10as / al@xmath2ga@xmath3as / al@xmath9ga@xmath10as quantum wells in which the electrons are confined to the al@xmath2ga@xmath3as alloy and which have different values of the aluminum molar fraction @xmath1 @xcite . since the disorder is added to the electron channel during the molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) growth , it is controlled and precisely quantified . </S>",
    "<S> disorder is found to suppress the energy gap of the @xmath0 fqhs . </S>",
    "<S> however , to our surprise we find strong @xmath0 fqhss in alloy samples at values of the electron mobility at which this state does not develop at all in the highest quality alloy - free samples . </S>",
    "<S> the mobility threshold for the formation of the @xmath0 fqhs in the alloy samples is thus much reduced as compared to that in the alloy - free samples . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the engineering of the exotic fqhss , such as the one at @xmath0 , is critically dependent on the different length scales of competing disorders present in the 2deg : the short - range alloy and interface roughness disorder and the long - range coulomb disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> a sketch of the active region of our alloy - free reference sample and of a sample containing alloy disorder are shown in the insets of fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the sample growth procedure and characterization of our samples at @xmath11  mk can be found in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> details of the samples , of the state preparation , and of other aspects of the low temperature measurements reported in this letter can be found in the supplementary materials section . </S>",
    "<S> we note that mbe - controlled alloy disorder was first introduced to 2degs in ref.@xcite . however , in these samples @xcite the @xmath0 fqhs has not been observed . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , our samples have several essential features which are optimized for a strong @xmath0 fqhs even in the presence of the disorder . </S>",
    "<S> first , the 2deg is confined to a symmetrically doped quantum well rather than a single heterointerface . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for a higher electron density , enhancing therefore fragile fqhss . </S>",
    "<S> second , we use a reduced al content @xmath12 in the al@xmath9ga@xmath10as barriers , which enhances the @xmath0 fqhs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> third , we use a short period superlattice doping scheme @xcite , which is known to yield a strong @xmath0 fqhs @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to appreciate that only the alloy disorder is different in each sample . </S>",
    "<S> all other sample parameters , however , are left virtually unchanged . in order to avoid any density dependent effects the electron density </S>",
    "<S> is kept constant , close to @xmath13/@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , in our samples @xmath14/@xmath15/@xmath8 . furthermore </S>",
    "<S> , the alloy content @xmath1 of the electron channel al@xmath2ga@xmath3as is low when compared to that in the confining al@xmath9ga@xmath10as . </S>",
    "<S> there is therefore virtually no variation of the electronic effective mass @xmath16 and of the electronic confinement in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the 2deg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other parameters held constant include the position of the 2deg relative to the sample surface and the thickness of the capping layer @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows the magnetoresistance @xmath17 and the hall resistance @xmath18 of the alloy - free reference sample , i.e. for which @xmath19 , measured at @xmath20  mk in a van der pauw geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the figure is limited to magnetic fields @xmath21 for which the filling factor ranges between @xmath22 , commonly referred to as the lower spin branch of the second landau level . because of the high quality growth and sample design described earlier we observe strong fqhss at @xmath0 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 as indicated by vanishing @xmath17 and quantized @xmath18 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other more fragile fqhss are also seen in fig.1 @xcite .     and hall resistance @xmath18 in the reference sample with @xmath19 ( top panel ) and the alloy sample with @xmath25 ( bottom panel ) as measured at 7  mk . </S>",
    "<S> numbers indicate the filling factors of various fqhss and insets are sketches of the sample structure . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ]    alloy disorder strongly affects magnetoresistance . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in the traces of the sample with @xmath25 gathered at 7  mk , which are also shown in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the most fragile fqhss , such as the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 fqhss , are destroyed . </S>",
    "<S> the fqhs at @xmath0 , however , remains fully quantized in spite of the presence of alloy disorder . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , at this @xmath29 there is a vanishing @xmath17 and the rigorously quantized @xmath30 , which holds to a precision of 1 part in 10@xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> next we have investigated the temperature dependence of the @xmath0 fqhs . </S>",
    "<S> thermalization of electrons in our experiment is assured by the use of a @xmath5he immersion cell @xcite and temperature measurements of the @xmath5he bath below 100  mk are performed with the aid of a tuning fork viscosity thermometer @xcite . at the lowest temperatures @xmath31 the magnetoresistance of the @xmath0 fqhs follows an activated form @xmath32 , from which we extract the energy gap @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig.2 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath17 at @xmath0 on an arrhenius plot , i.e. @xmath33 as function of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the linear segment indicates that transport is activated . in the alloy - free reference sample </S>",
    "<S> we find a record high energy gap @xmath35  mk @xcite .     on the aluminum mole fraction @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in a sample with @xmath36 we do not observe a fqhs at @xmath0 , hence the excluded shaded area . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows arrhenius plots for the @xmath0 fqhs in three representative samples . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ]    the inset of fig.2 also shows the @xmath31-dependence of @xmath17 at @xmath0 in two representative alloy samples with @xmath37 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of linear segments at non - zero @xmath1 means the survival of activated transport even in the presence of alloy disorder . </S>",
    "<S> it is , therefore , meaningful to extract energy gaps in the alloy samples as well . </S>",
    "<S> values found are tabulated in the supplementary materials section and are plotted as function of @xmath1 in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find the @xmath6 has a decreasing trend with an increasing @xmath1 . at the largest value of @xmath36 we studied , we no longer observe a fqhs at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> a linear fit to the data passing through the point associated with the @xmath19 reference sample shows that the gap closes at the extrapolated value of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the error in @xmath6 as determined from the arrhenius fits is estimated to @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in fig.2 there is also scatter in the data possibly caused by small variations in the sample densities and slight variations from the target value of the alloy content @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the aluminum fraction @xmath1 in our alloy samples is clearly a measure of the added disorder . in the literature </S>",
    "<S> the most commonly used metric for the disorder is the mobility @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> . early work on the @xmath0 fqhs found that the energy gap of the state correlates well with the mobility @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that a higher @xmath40 resulted in a larger @xmath6 and the @xmath0 fqhs does not develop for mobility less than the threshold value @xmath41@xmath8/vs . </S>",
    "<S> later it became apparent that there is in fact a poor correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath40 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , a threshold @xmath42 below which a @xmath0 fqhs does not develop was still identified . </S>",
    "<S> the shaded area of fig.3 shows the stability region of the @xmath0 fqhs in high quality alloy - free samples at densities @xmath43@xmath8 close to that of our samples @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these data are taken from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> a threshold value @xmath44@xmath8/vs for these alloy - free samples is clearly seen .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.3 also shows that a strong @xmath0 fqhs with @xmath45  mk develops in the alloy sample with @xmath46@xmath8/vs . </S>",
    "<S> this is surprising , since at such a low mobility a @xmath0 fqhs has never been observed . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this mobility is much below the the previously established @xmath44@xmath8/vs threshold in high quality alloy - free samples . </S>",
    "<S> we thus found that the mobility threshold for a fully quantized @xmath0 fqhs is significantly lowered in the presence of alloy disorder and , therefore , the @xmath0 fqhs is robust to the presence of alloy disorder . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we conclude that alloy disorder does not appear to be as detrimental to the development of the @xmath0 fqhs as the residual disorder unintentionally added during sample growth . </S>",
    "<S> the gap @xmath6 for our alloy samples closes at an extrapolated new threshold of @xmath47@xmath8/vs .     on inverse </S>",
    "<S> mobility @xmath48 and the electronic scattering rate @xmath49 of our samples ( closed symbols ) and of alloy - free samples from the literature with densities near @xmath50/@xmath8 . in our alloy samples the @xmath0 fqhs survives at surprisingly high @xmath48 and , therefore , low @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the arrow indicates a sample in which the @xmath0 fqhs does not develop . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ]    it is important to appreciate that not only our samples have controllably added alloy disorder but , with the exception of the sample with @xmath51 , alloy disorder is the dominant scattering mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case because the electron scattering rate in our alloy samples @xmath49 exceeds the residual scattering rate of the alloy - free reference sample @xmath52ns@xmath53 @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 is the transport scattering time . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in fig.3 , @xmath6 is linearly decreasing with @xmath49 with the slope of 41  mk@xmath55ns . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the gap extrapolates to zero near @xmath56  ns@xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> since al is a neutral impurity , when added to a perfect gaas crystal , it perturbs the crystal potential on sub - nanometer length scale . the alloy disorder we study thus generates a short - range scattering potential @xcite . in a recent experiment a different type of short - range disorder , </S>",
    "<S> that due to surface roughness scattering , was investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that in a heterojunction insulated gate field - effect transistor @xmath6 increases with a decreasing mobility , a result which is opposite to our findings . </S>",
    "<S> one reason for this discrepancy is that in ref.@xcite the electron density is increased as the mobility is decreasing . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative effect of the disorder on the energy gap in ref.@xcite , therefore , remains difficult to extract . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the dominance of the short - range scattering could not be ascertained and the gap altering effects of the combination of changing density and wavefunction confinement were not disentangled from that of the disorder @xcite . in two other experiments , the effect on the @xmath0 fqhs of a different type of disorder , </S>",
    "<S> that due to the remote ionized dopants was investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that increasing the level of the remote dopants leads to the strengthening of the @xmath0 fqhs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic dependence of the energy gap on overdoping , however , remains unavailable to date . </S>",
    "<S> our results thus highlight the effect of the short - range alloy disorder on the stability of the @xmath0 fqhs , whereas the effect of other important types of disorder , such as those of the long - range coulomb potentials of dopants and of background impurities , remain unknown .    </S>",
    "<S> the lack of correlation of @xmath6 and @xmath40 in alloy - free samples reported in the literature remains an outstanding puzzle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that such a lack of correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath40 appears because a ) a well defined @xmath6 versus @xmath40 correlation exists when only one type of disorder dominates and a single heterostructure design is employed and b ) for each kind of disorder the @xmath6 versus @xmath40 functional relationship is different . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , because high quality alloy - free samples most likely have a different mix of the various disorders and because @xmath6 and @xmath40 track differently for each specific type of disorder , the result is a lack of correlation of @xmath6 and @xmath40 when an analysis of dissimilar samples is undertaken . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , when in a series of similar samples one type of disorder dominates , such as in our experiment , @xmath6 and @xmath40 should be correlated . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the quasi - linear correlation of @xmath6 and @xmath40 in our alloy samples shown in fig.3 supports the above hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis , however , remains to be tested in instances in which various other types of disorder are dominant . </S>",
    "<S> a natural consequence of our analysis is that @xmath40 measured at zero @xmath21-field , and the single - particle lifetime measured in the low @xmath21-field semi - classical regime @xcite are poor measures of the impact of the disorder on many - body ground states developed at large @xmath21-fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that we have measured the single - particle lifetime @xmath57 for our series of samples and found no obvious correlation with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of this data is left to a future publication . as seen in the inset of fig.2 , above 100  mk </S>",
    "<S> there is little or no change with temperature in the magnetoresistance @xmath17 at @xmath0 . according to the cf description , in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the system is described by a fermi sea of the cfs in a zero effective magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find the temperature - independent @xmath17 value above 100  mk correlates with the amount of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath58 , the saturation value of @xmath17 at 150  mk measured at @xmath0 , are listed in the supplementary materials section . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that , @xmath58 increases with an increasing @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> according to the cf theory , @xmath58 is a measure of the scattering of the cf with the impurities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the linear increase of @xmath58 with @xmath1 is a direct consequence of enhanced scattering rate of the cfs as @xmath1 increases . </S>",
    "<S> we thus find that at @xmath0 an increasing alloy disorder has two independent concurring effects : it reduces the energy gap of the state and it enhances @xmath58 , the @xmath31-independent @xmath17 at @xmath0 in the limit of high temperatures .    in an effort to speed up the screening of the samples and to characterize them at @xmath5he refrigerator temperatures at which the @xmath0 fqhs does not yet develop , it was proposed that strong @xmath0 fqhss develop in samples with low values of the @xmath31-independent @xmath17 measured at @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we thus found that such a hypothesis has a natural explanation within the framework of the composite fermion theory and , furthermore , that the hypothesis works in samples with alloy disorder . </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis , however , remains to be further tested in samples with different types of dominating disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that recently an alternative method of extracting the energy gap has been proposed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model , however , is formulated for the slowly varying potential generated by the remote dopants and it yet remains to be extended to alloy scattering . </S>",
    "<S> there is also effort in understanding short - range scatterers , albeit so far only for the @xmath59 fqhs @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the effect of alloy disorder on the @xmath0 fqhs in a regime in which alloy disorder dominates . </S>",
    "<S> the gap of the @xmath0 fqhs closes at unprecedentedly low mobility which indicates that alloy disorder may not be as detrimental to the formation of the @xmath0 fqhs as other types of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> understanding disorder will lead to a better understanding of other parameters influencing the @xmath0 fqhs , which will ultimately result in a better engineering of this state .    </S>",
