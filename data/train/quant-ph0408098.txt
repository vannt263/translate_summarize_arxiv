    "there are many different physical systems being considered for a quantum computer . of these",
    ", optical systems are promising , offering benefits such as low decoherence and easy single qubit manipulation .",
    "multi qubit gates are beginning to be demonstrated @xcite and the next stage is to start linking several gates together into small scale algorithms .",
    "finding efficient ways of implementing these gates will be crucial to the overall success of the program . in this paper",
    "we show that the the resources required to implement linear optics quantum computation ( loqc ) based on the ideas in klm @xcite can be significantly reduced .",
    "a universal set of gates is necessary for quantum computing to be possible , and in loqc a convenient set to choose is an entangling gate such as a controlled - not ( cnot ) together with arbitrary single qubit gates . to be able to generate an arbitrary transformation on a single qubit , it suffices to produce arbitrary rotations in one direction on the bloch sphere , and @xmath0 degree rotations in an orthogonal direction .    in loqc",
    "the qubit is typically encoded in `` dual - rail '' form . with dual - rail encoding , arbitrary deterministic rotations in both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions by @xmath3 as @xmath4 are possible with only passive linear optical elements ( such as phase shifters and beam - splitters ) meaning that any single qubit transformation can be performed with relative ease .",
    "the real difficulty arises in performing a cnot gate between single photon qubits .",
    "this requires a nonlinearity sufficiently large that a single photon can induce a @xmath5 phase shift on another , and such a large intrinsic nonlinearity is not possible with current materials .    in 2001 ,",
    "knill , laflamme & milburn ( klm ) @xcite presented a way of implementing scalable quantum computing using single photons , linear optics and photo - detection .",
    "vital to the proposal was the elimination of the need for the non - linear coupling between photons , replacing it instead with a heralded nondeterministic cnot gate ( that is , a cnot gate that does not always work ; but when it does , it is known to have worked ) .",
    "the gate klm described functions with a success probability of @xmath6 .",
    "later work resulted in a number of variations on the basic non - deterministic gate @xcite .",
    "using a non - deterministic cnot gate is only the first step , as clearly , chaining many of them together can not be efficiently scalable . to allow non - deterministic gates to be performed on the qubits with a high probability of success ,",
    "klm suggested using teleportation @xcite .",
    "this will allow the gates to be performed on an entangled state , which is then used as resource for the circuit . by using this modified entanglement to teleport the input qubit ,",
    "the gate will be applied to the qubit with certainty in the event of a successful teleportation .",
    "a key complication in loqc schemes is a lack of deterministic bell measurement , hence the teleportation itself can not be performed deterministically .",
    "the klm proposal counteracts this with a family of teleporters which asymptotically approach a success rate of 100% as the complexity of the required entanglement increases .",
    "in addition , a teleportation failure looks like a @xmath2-measurement error ( an accidental measurement in the computational basis ) , and error correction can be used to protect against this  for a recent experimental demonstration of the technique see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose using an incremental approach to the encoding .",
    "this approach simplifies the process of gate attempts and recovery , and leads to improved procedures for performing gates on the encoded qubits .",
    "issues of fault tolerance are not covered in this paper ; the techniques described here deal only with the intrinsic errors resulting from the use of non - deterministic systems .",
    "the aim is to find efficient implementations of the gates for use in loqc .",
    "section  [ sec : klm ] of this paper contains a brief overview of the salient concepts and procedures used in the original klm proposal .",
    "section  [ sec : incremental ] presents our alternative approach to producing and operating on encoded qubits",
    ". section  [ sec : probs ] contains an analysis of the probabilities of operation of the encoded gates , and section  [ sec : resources ] tallies the resources required by our incremental scheme .",
    "recently some publications have considered promising implementations of linear optics quantum computing using cluster state architectures produced via klm - style gates @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the scheme in this paper has similarities to the cluster state models , since the process of encoding and re - encoding is closely related to the process used to build up a cluster state .",
    "however , our discussion is restricted to the standard quantum circuit type architecture .",
    "we briefly review the key features of the klm proposal .",
    "the klm proposal describes a family of teleporters t@xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is a positive integer ) which function with a probability @xmath9 , each needing a successively larger entanglement resource to be prepared .",
    "the general entanglement resource for teleportation is : @xmath10 note that the most basic teleporter has a success probability of @xmath11 and its resource state can be prepared with just beam - splitters .      besides improving the probability of successfully performing a gate , the teleportation scheme has the advantage of a well - defined failure behaviour . in the event that the teleportation fails ,",
    "it acts as a @xmath2-measurement with known outcome on the qubit which was to be teleported .",
    "hence the probability of a successful teleportation can be improved by using error correction to protect the qubits from @xmath2-measurements . , but is not useful in this proposal since it lacks the well - defined failure mode required by the scheme . ]",
    "encoding against unwanted @xmath2-measurements is one of the simplest forms of error correction .",
    "a two - qubit encoding is given as an example in the klm proposal ( note that kets containing bold font are used to indicate logical qubit states , as distinct from mode occupation numbers ) : @xmath12 so that an arbitrary qubit @xmath13 becomes : @xmath14.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the notation @xmath15 represents a state encoded across two qubits .    here",
    "the logical qubit can be recovered if a single @xmath2-measurement occurs , as long as the result of the measurement and which qubit it occurred on are known .",
    "the effect of a measurement of `` 0 '' on one of the qubits is to leave the other qubit in the original unencoded state . in the event that a `` 1 '' is measured , an @xmath1 gate",
    "must first be performed on the remaining qubit in order to reproduce the original state .",
    "therefore , correcting an unwanted measurement will require a possible @xmath1 operation , followed in both cases by re - encoding the state to @xmath15 .",
    "to apply the encoding across more than two qubits , klm uses a concatenated approach where the same encoding and operational procedures are applied to each level of the encoded qubits .",
    "for example , @xmath16 each concatenation doubles the number of component qubits used , but the total probability of failure on a gate performed at that level decreases . as a result",
    ", the chance of failure can be made arbitrarily small by successive concatenations of the code .",
    "of course , the resources required to perform the encoding also increases .",
    "a variation of the teleporter circuit is described in klm for use in the higher levels of encoding ( figure 5a of @xcite ) .",
    "the entanglement resource used to create this teleporter is denoted .",
    "this circuit is formed using the fundamental set of gates described earlier , and will teleport a qubit with certainty if the gates are performed successfully .",
    "if the gates in the teleporter fail , the overall effect is again a @xmath2-measurement on the qubit to be teleported .",
    "hence the problem of performing gates on higher levels reduces to one of successful teleportation at the lowest level .",
    "figure [ figklmg ] shows the manner in which an encoded controlled - phase - flip gate ( cs gate ) is constructed in the klm scheme .",
    "each cs gate performed at a particular level of encoding is implemented by applying this circuit to the next level down .     and",
    "c@xmath17 indicate correction gates which depend on the measurements made when teleporting , and are described in the klm paper .",
    "the circled gates indicate an operation of the form @xmath18 and are also described in the klm paper .",
    "the dashed box indicates the resource state for the gate , and this can be prepared off - line . ]",
    "there are two non - deterministic operations in the set required by klm , when acting on encoded states .",
    "these are the @xmath19 and cs gates .",
    "klm suggest circuits for implementing these gates , to be applied iteratively at each level of concatenation .",
    "these circuits use teleportation networks built from the basic set of gates , and accordingly each requires its own resource state , which must also be built up iteratively .",
    "the possibility of measurement error recovery is considered in the failure probability given for the two non - deterministic gates .",
    "when the code is concatenated , increasing the size of the encoding , the failure probabilities for these gates drop correspondingly .",
    "the failure probability for teleporting a logical qubit , given in @xcite , is : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the probability that a teleportation on one of the two component qubits fails .",
    "@xmath22 is the probability for a encoded @xmath19 rotation failing , which requires one teleportation of a logical qubit .",
    "the probability of successfully applying a cs gate is @xmath23 , since it requires that two encoded qubits be teleported . by using the equation iteratively ,",
    "the total probability of gate success can be calculated for a given level of encoding .",
    "these calculations show that , using t@xmath24 teleporters , a four - qubit encoding is required to achieve a success rate of at least 95% when performing a cs gate .",
    "instead of using a concatenated approach to the encoding , we will add the component qubits to the encoded state incrementally .",
    "when a @xmath2-measurement error occurs , one of the component qubits is removed from the entanglement , and this can be corrected by re - encoding using a non - deterministic encoding circuit .",
    "gates on the overall state can also be performed via re - encoding .",
    "the error - correcting code described earlier ( eq .  [ zmcode ] ) can be extended to any number of qubits , in order to protect against multiple @xmath2-measurements .",
    "the general form of the code represents the logical @xmath25 state as an equal superposition of all states with even parity ( an even number of the component qubits are in the @xmath26 state ) , and the logical @xmath26 as an equal superposition of all states with odd parity .",
    "this is true whether the method of encoding is incremental or concatenated .",
    "hence a general qubit encoded across @xmath8 component qubits can be written as , @xmath27    a @xmath2-measurement followed by the conditional application of an @xmath1 gate leaves the qubit in the correct encoded state , but with one fewer component qubits than it had initially . after a sufficient number of @xmath2-measurements the encoded qubit",
    "will eventually be reduced to the unencoded qubit @xmath28 .      instead of doubling the encoding by applying  ( [ zmcode ] ) to each level",
    ", we will add qubits to the encoding incrementally .",
    "the circuit required to add an additional qubit to the encoding , consists of a cnot gate and an ancillary qubit prepared as @xmath29 ( figure [ enccir ] ) .",
    "the ancillary qubit is the control for the gate , and the target is one of the components of the encoded qubit .",
    "applying this circuit to a state encoded across @xmath8 qubits will produce the correct encoding for the state across @xmath30 qubits .        by using encoding and teleportation ,",
    "a non - deterministic gate could be achieved with arbitrarily high success probability . however , since the encoding circuit itself involves a non - deterministic gate , we need to teleport this gate and the success rate of the teleporters must be sufficiently high to produce an average gain in the encoding .    for a gate in which one of the inputs is known in advance , that input can be included in the resource preparation , removing the need for one of the teleporters and improving the probability of success ( the probability of the gate functioning becomes the same as the probability of the teleportation succeeding ) .",
    "this is the case for the encoder , since one of the inputs is an ancillary qubit which will always be in the state @xmath31 , and so the encoder functions with the probability of the teleporter used .",
    "a failure of the encoder gate results in a @xmath2-measurement , and the encoded state loses a component qubit . since the encoder is designed to add one qubit if successful , encoding is equivalent to a gambling game , with the chances of winning dependent on the success rate of the encoder .",
    "this rate needs to be greater than 50% to make long - term gains , since we will gain or lose a qubit depending on whether the encoder succeeds or fails respectively .",
    "the gates described in klm are all in single - rail form , in that they teleport only one rail and perform operations solely on it . if changes other than phase shifts occur within the gate the number of photons is not conserved , which is a requirement in a dual - rail system .",
    "this limits a dual rail system to performing cs gates via single - rail teleportation @xcite .",
    "however , a cnot gate is required when creating the incremental encoding or for performing a encoded cnot efficiently .",
    "a teleported cs is not sufficient , since a hadamard gate would have to be performed on the individual qubit beforehand , and doing so takes the overall state out of the code space .",
    "if a teleportation failure occurs , the qubit can no longer be recovered .",
    "a solution is to implement a fully dual - rail encoder and teleport both rails of the input qubit .",
    "it is known that a dual - rail qubit may be teleported by making a bell measurement on the pair of rails @xcite . in this manner , with an appropriate resource , the second rail of a physical qubit can be teleported with certainty if the first rail has been successfully teleported .",
    "this allows the entire gate to be made dual - rail without reducing the probability of it working .",
    "a dual - rail encoder is not limited to performing only phase changes .",
    "the hadamards on either side of the cs can be executed deterministically during the resource preparation .",
    "the disadvantage of this solution is that the size of the entanglement needed to teleport the input qubit doubles , and becomes harder to prepare .",
    "the teleporter entanglement is a dual - rail form of the entanglement needed for the single - rail teleporter . for the t@xmath32 encoder ,",
    "this is a bell state .",
    "the circuit for a dual - rail encoder is shown in figure [ figdre ] .",
    "indicates a @xmath2-rotation correction dependent on the output measurements .",
    "for higher success rates , a larger entanglement , , is used , and the single beam - splitters are replaced with arrays of beam splitters that distribute the incoming qubits equally over @xmath8 detectors . the circuit shown here is for spatial encoding , and polarization encoding may vary the design . ]    for a general cnot gate , in which both inputs are unknown , it is only necessary to use a dual - rail teleporter for the target qubit : since the control qubit should remain unchanged , a single - rail teleporter will suffice .      for operations on the encoded states , a series of gates performed on the component qubits",
    "are often required in order to produce a single operation at the encoded level .",
    "this could be achieved using a series of teleported gates applied to the component qubits ; or performing the entire encoded gate at once by constructing a large entangled state with the gates already applied , and teleporting every qubit on to it .",
    "the klm proposal uses the latter method .",
    "however , constructing the necessary entangled state requires a large number of resources . in both cases , re - encoding",
    "will also be needed to recover from teleportation failures .",
    "if encoding is employed during the computation , it offers new possibilities .",
    "by re - encoding from a subset of the component qubits that have had the desired operation performed on them , some encoded gates may be performed more efficiently .",
    "this is in general preferable to procedures requiring a series of encoded gates , as re - encoding would be needed in any case due to teleporter failures .",
    "indicates a bit - flip correction dependent on the outcome of the measurements . ]",
    "the encoded cnot gate can be made more efficient by using re - encoding as part of the gate .",
    "first a cnot is performed between a pair of component qubits , one from each encoded qubit , with the logical control qubit providing the control for this gate ( figure [ enccnot ] ) .",
    "executing a cnot successfully on one of the component qubits in the control state produces a subset ( of one qubit ) which has undergone the desired rotation .",
    "encoding can now be performed on the qubit , until the subset reaches the size of the original state . in the event that teleportation failures cause the entire subset of component qubits to be lost , the cnot can be re - attempted on another qubit and the process applied again . once the subset reaches the size of the original state , the remaining unaltered qubits can be measured .",
    "if an overall odd parity is measured , bit - flips must be performed on both the control and target qubits .",
    "this is sufficient to produce a cnot between the two encoded qubits .",
    "the @xmath19 rotation will also benefit greatly from being implemented in this manner . to produce a suitably rotated qubit requires a @xmath19 on one of the component qubits in the state .",
    "the next step is to encode from the rotated qubit until the subset again reaches the size of the original state .",
    "the remaining component qubits are then measured .",
    "depending on the total parity of the measurements , it may be necessary to perform a @xmath33 rotation to correct the state , as well as the normal bit - flips required whenever measuring a qubit .",
    "the gates may be attempted until successful , and the problem reduces to one of maintaining the encoding . the only way in which the total encoded state can be lost is when the encoder has a sufficiently long run of failures . by adjusting the level of encoding used and the complexity of the teleporter in the encoder , the probability of failure can be controlled and kept within an acceptable limit .",
    "each attempt to encode , adds a qubit to the encoding with probability @xmath34 , which is equal to the probability of the teleporter succeeding .",
    "if the encoder fails , a qubit is removed from the encoding .",
    "what we want to calculate is the probability of successfully adding a component qubit , without losing the entire encoded qubit .",
    "this process can be modelled as a random walk on a discrete , one - dimensional lattice , with probabilities of moving in the positive or negative directions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the lattice has absorbing boundaries at @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "these boundaries correspond to successfully adding a qubit , and to losing _ all _ the component qubits in the encoding .",
    "starting from location @xmath39 on the lattice , @xmath40 , the probability @xmath41 of reaching @xmath36 without first reaching @xmath37 is given by the solution to the equation @xcite , @xmath42 this is a homogeneous second order difference equation and can be solved simply by trial solutions yielding , @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "the probability of successfully adding a qubit without losing the encoding is therefore @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the current number of components making up the encoded qubit , that is : @xmath49    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , the concepts and techniques put forward in klm were reworked using a incremental form of encoding against @xmath2-measurement errors rather than using a concatenated approach .",
    "the general encoding circuit for producing this code was described , and can be used to implement encoded gates with improved efficiency .",
    "this allows computations to be safely performed with fewer resources than would be required by the original klm scheme .",
    "the random walk model for the encoding process was used to verify that the proposal scales efficiently for teleporter probabilities greater than 0.5 .",
    "the scaling allows for a large number of gates to be performed safely in the ideal case using a relatively low level of encoding .",
    "although the scaling is still of the same order as that achieved by the original proposal , the improved efficiency makes this scheme preferable for implementation , if the resources can be produced reliably .",
    "recently , the cluster state models have shown great promise for efficiently implementing loqc . due to the similarity between these processes and those used in our scheme , it is likely that some of the techniques described here can also be applied to the development of cluster state proposals and vice - versa .",

    "we would like to thank michael nielsen for discussions and suggesting this project , and andrew white , geoff pryde , jeremy obrien , nathan langford and nicole muir for helpful comments on this manuscript .",
    "here we discuss the use of elimination circuits for producing the entanglement resource required for the higher order teleporters .",
    "the construction is related to the cs gate , but instead of inserting a sign change on a particular state component , it eliminates that component .",
    "consider preparing the entanglement resource for the single rail @xmath50 teleporter .",
    "we start with the two dual rail single photon states @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the dual rails of each of the photons are mixed on a @xmath53 reflectivity beam - splitter giving : @xmath54 now include two single photon fock states in modes 2 and 5 : @xmath55 modes 3 and 4 are mixed on a @xmath11 reflectivity beam - splitter .",
    "@xmath56 next , modes 2 and 3 , and modes 4 and 5 , are mixed on @xmath57 reflectivity beam - splitters .",
    "the conditional state obtained when one and only one photon is found in mode 2 and simultaneously one and only one photon is found in mode 5 is given by : @xmath58 the effect of this conditional step is to remove the terms containing photon pairs . modes 3 and 4 are then mixed on another @xmath11 reflectivity beam - splitter and we get @xmath59 which is the required entangled state , produced with a probability of @xmath60 .    the entanglement resource for a _ dual _ rail @xmath50 teleporter can be produced in a similar way .",
    "we first need to produce the states @xmath61 these can be produced from separable inputs via some linear optics elements and two cs gates .",
    "as before we include two single photon fock states in modes 2 and 5 : @xmath62 the protocol now proceeds just as before on modes 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "the resultant state is then @xmath63 which is the required entangled state for dual rail , produced again with a probability of @xmath60 .",
    "the general formula for the teleporter entanglement is given in eq .",
    "( [ tnform1 ] ) . to produce the entanglement , first assume that the entanglement can be made : @xmath64 now add a bell state of the form @xmath65 , @xmath66 then it can be linked to the state via an elimination circuit , producing .",
    "the elimination operation is performed on qubits @xmath67 and @xmath68 , removing any states containing @xmath69 .",
    "that is , @xmath70    for @xmath71 , the required entanglement is simply a bell state : @xmath72 .",
    "if a single - rail teleporter is to be used , these states can be created deterministically using a beam splitter . in dual - rail ,",
    "they require a cs gate in order to produce them .    from this",
    ", it can be seen that preparing the state @xmath73 requires @xmath74 successfully performed elimination circuits .",
    "if the teleporter is to be dual - rail , an additional @xmath8 cs gates are also required .    in building up the entanglement , it is more efficient to perform each cs and elimination circuit separately , then link them together using teleportation .",
    "basic 50% success teleporters can be used , as these require no extra resources .",
    "the inputs to the circuits are single photons in the state @xmath75 , which is easily produced via a beam - splitter . for the elimination circuit ,",
