    "why is it of interest to know the galaxy distribution behind the milky way , and why is it not sufficient to study galaxies and their large - scale distribution away from the foreground `` pollution '' of the milky way ? to understand the dynamics in the nearby universe and answer the question whether the the dipole in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and other velocity flow fields ( e.g. towards the great attractor ) can be fully explained by the clumpy galaxy / mass distribution , whole - sky coverage is essential .",
    "the lack of data in large areas of the sky  where the size of the gap due to the milky way depends on the wavelength at which galaxies are sampled  constitutes a severe restriction in solving these questions .    based on various dedicated observational programs , using nearly all the bands of the electromagnetic spectrum , and the charting of large - scale structures and flow fields in the zone of avoidance ( zoa ) from statistical reconstructions , a lot of progress has been achieved . in this review",
    ", we will give a status report on all of the above approaches .",
    "after a historic perspective on the zoa ( sect .",
    "[ zoa ] ) , the cosmological questions for which the unveiling of the zoa are most relevant are described ( sect .",
    "[ const ] ) . in sect .",
    "[ ext ] , a discussion on the current knowledge of the foreground extinction is presented .",
    "this is followed by a description of the various observational multi - wavelength techniques that are currently being employed to uncover the galaxy distribution in the zoa such as deep optical searches ( sect .",
    "[ opt ] ) , near - infrared and far - infrared surveys ( sect .  [ nir ] , and [ fir ] ) , systematic blind radio surveys ( sect .",
    "[ hi ] ) and searches for hidden massive x - ray clusters ( sect .  [ xray ] ) .",
    "for each method , the different limitations and selection effects and results are presented .",
    "the various statistical reconstruction methods are reviewed and results of the density field in the zoa compared with observational data ( sect .",
    "[ recon ] ) .",
    "a first reference to the zone of avoidance ( zoa ) , or the `` zone of few nebulae '' was made in 1878 by proctor , based on the distribution of nebulae in the `` general catalogue of nebulae '' by sir john herschel ( 1864 ) .",
    "this zone becomes considerably more prominent in the distribution of nebulae presented by charlier ( 1922 ) using data from the `` new general catalogue '' by dreyer ( 1888 , 1895 ) .",
    "these data also reveal first indications of large - scale structure : the nebulae display a very clumpy distribution .",
    "currently well - known galaxy clusters such as virgo , fornax , perseus , pisces and coma are easily recognizable even though dreyer s catalog contains both galactic and extragalactic objects as it was not known then that the majority of the nebulae actually are external stellar systems similar to the milky way .",
    "even more obvious in this distribution , though , is the absence of galaxies around the galactic equator .",
    "as extinction was poorly known at that time , no connection was made between the milky way and the `` zone of few nebulae '' .",
    "a first definition of the zoa was proposed by shapley ( 1961 ) as the region delimited by `` the isopleth of five galaxies per square degree from the lick and harvard surveys '' ( compared to a mean of 54 gal./sq.deg .",
    "found in unobscured regions by shane & wirtanen , 1967 ) .",
    "this `` zone of avoidance '' used to be `` avoided '' by astronomers interested in the extragalactic sky because of the lack of data in that area of the sky and the inherent difficulties in analyzing the few obscured galaxies known there .",
    "merging data from more recent galaxy catalogs , i.e. the uppsala general catalog ugc ( nilson 1973 ) for the north ( @xmath2 ) , the eso uppsala catalog ( lauberts 1982 ) for the south ( @xmath3 ) , and the morphological catalog of galaxies mcg ( vorontsov - velyaminov & archipova 1963 - 74 ) for the strip inbetween ( @xmath4 ) , a whole - sky galaxy catalog can be defined . to homogenize the data determined by different groups from different survey material , the following adjustments have to be applied to the diameters : @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( see fouqu & paturel 1985 , lahav 1987 ) . according to hudson & lynden - bell ( 1991 )",
    "this `` whole - sky '' catalog then is complete for galaxies larger than @xmath7 .",
    "the distribution of these galaxies is displayed in galactic coordinates in fig .",
    "[ ait ] in an equal - area aitoff projection centered on the galactic bulge ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the galaxies are diameter - coded , so that structures relevant for the dynamics in the local universe stand out accordingly .",
    "figure  [ ait ] clearly displays the irregularity in the distribution of galaxies in the nearby universe such as the local supercluster visible as a great circle ( the supergalactic plane ) centered on the virgo cluster at @xmath9 , the perseus - pisces chain ( pp ) bending into the zoa at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the general overdensity in the cosmic microwave background dipole direction ( @xmath12 ; kogut et  al .",
    "1993 ) and the general galaxy overdensity in the great attractor region ( ga ) centered on @xmath13 ( kolatt et  al .",
    "1995 ) with the hydra ( @xmath14 ) , antlia ( @xmath15 ) , centaurus ( @xmath16 ) and pavo ( @xmath17 ) clusters .",
    "most conspicuous in this distribution is , however , the very broad , nearly empty band of about 20@xmath18 width . as optical galaxy catalogs",
    "are limited to the largest galaxies they become increasingly incomplete close to the galactic equator where the dust thickens .",
    "this diminishes the light emission of the galaxies and reduces their visible extent .",
    "such obscured galaxies are not included in diameter- or magnitude - limited catalogs because they appear small and faint  even though they might be intrinsically large and bright .",
    "a further complication is the growing number of foreground stars close to the galactic plane ( gp ) which fully or partially block the view of galaxy images .",
    "comparing this `` band of few galaxies '' with the currently available 100  dust extinction maps of the dirbe experiment ( schlegel et  al .",
    "1998 ; see sect .  [ ext ] ) , we can see that the zoa  the area where the galaxy counts become severely incomplete  is described almost perfectly by the absorption contour in the blue @xmath19 of @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 ; cardelli et  al .",
    "this contour matches the by shapley ( 1961 ) defined zoa closely .",
    "enormous effort and observation time has been devoted in the last decades to establish the extragalactic large - scale structure . from the various redshift slices , 3-dimensional pictures",
    "evolve that distribute galaxies predominantly in clusters , sheets and filaments , leaving large areas devoid of luminous matter .",
    "these filaments , respectively their sizes , carry information on the conditions and formation processes of the early universe , providing important constraints which must be reproduced in cosmological models .",
    "many of the known nearby large - scale structures are , however , bisected by the galactic plane - such as the local supercluster , the perseus - pisces chain , and the great attractor ( see fig .",
    "[ ait ] ) . what is their true extent and their mass ?",
    "it is curious that the two major superclusters in the local universe , i.e. perseus - pisces and the great attractor overdensity , lie at similar distances on opposite sides of the local group ( lg )  both partially obscured by the zoa .",
    "which one of the two is dominant in the tug - of - war on the lg ?",
    "do these features continue across the galactic plane and are there other massive structures hidden in the zoa for which so far no indication exists ?    what is the size of the largest coherent structures ? are , for instance , the great wall and the perseus - pisces chain connected across the zoa as suggested in 1982 by giovanelli & haynes ( but see marzke et  al .",
    "1996 ) , indicating structures of over @xmath22  mpc .",
    "the latter would be incompatible with the angular extent over which fluctuations ",
    "the seeds of current large - scale structures  have been measured in the cmb . to answer these questions ,",
    "superclusters need to be fully mapped across the zoa .",
    "filling the zoa also is paramount with respect to the evaluation of the peculiar velocity of the local group .",
    "the dipole anisotropy in the cmb radiation is explained by a peculiar motion of the lg relative to the cmb of @xmath23  kms@xmath24  towards @xmath25 ( kogut et  al .",
    "this motion arises from the net gravitational attraction on the lg due to the irregular distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "reproducing the vector measured in the cmb radiation with the lg motion determined from the matter distribution ( direction as well as convergence distance ) will lead to constraints on the cosmological parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the determination of the gravity field at the position of the lg , i.e. velocity and direction of the peculiar motion , requires whole - sky coverage .",
    "kolatt et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) have shown , for instance , that the mass distribution within @xmath26 of the zoa  as derived from theoretical reconstructions of the density field ( see sect .",
    "[ recon ] )  is crucial to the derivation of the gravitational acceleration of the lg : the direction of the motion measured within a volume of 6000  kms@xmath24  will change by @xmath27 when the ( reconstructed ) mass within the zoa is included .",
    "the results derived so far for the apex of the lg motion , as well as the distance at which convergence is attained , still are controversial .",
    "the lack of data for the zoa remains one of the main uncertainty in current dipole determinations ( e.g. rowan - robinson et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "most dipole determinations have assumed a uniformly filled zoa ( e.g. by poissonian statistics ) or have used cloning methods which transplant the fairly well - mapped regions adjacent to the zoa into the zoa , or a spherical harmonic analysis ( sect .",
    "[ recon ] ) .",
    "all procedures are unsatisfactory , because inhomogenous data coverage , incorrect assumptions on the galaxy distribution in the zoa , and/or false assumptions on the zoa mask to be filled will introduce nonexisting flow fields .",
    "care should therefore be taken on how to extrapolate the galaxy density field across the zoa .",
    "obviously , a reliable consensus on the galaxy distribution in the zoa is important to minimize these uncertainties .    in this context , not only the identification of unknown and suspected clusters , filaments and voids are relevant , but also the detection of nearby smaller entities . in linear theory , the peculiar velocity of the lg is propertional to the net gravity field which can be determined from the sum of the masses of all galaxies divided by the distance squared : @xmath28 where @xmath0 is the density parameter and @xmath1 the bias parameter . since gravity as well as the flux of a galaxy decrease with @xmath29 , the direction and amplitude of the peculiar velocity can be determined directly from , for instance , the sum of the _ apparent magnitudes _ of the galaxies in the sky under the assumption of constant mass - to - light ratio @xmath30 this has important implications and suggests , for instance , that the galaxy cena with an absorption - corrected magnitude of @xmath31 exerts a stronger luminosity - indicated gravitational attraction on the local group than the whole virgo cluster .",
    "the problem whether galaxies trace the mass is inherent to all cumulative dipole determinations .",
    "these calculations also predict that the 8 apparently brightest galaxies  which are all nearby ( @xmath32  kms@xmath24 )  are responsible for 20% of the total dipole as determined from optically known galaxies within @xmath33  kms@xmath24 .",
    "hence , a major part of the peculiar motion of the lg is generated by a few average , but nearby galaxies .",
    "note , however , that for nearby objects non - linear dynamics has to be taken into account .    in this sense",
    ", the detection of nearby galaxies or galaxy groups hidden by the obscuration layer of the galaxy can be as important as the detection of entire clusters at larger distances .",
    "the expectation of finding additional nearby galaxies in the zoa is not unrealistic .",
    "six of the nine apparently brightest galaxies ( extinction - corrected ) are located in the zoa : ic342 , maffei 1 , maffei 2 , ngc4945 , cena and the recently discovered galaxy dwingeloo 1 ( kraan - korteweg et  al .",
    "1994b ) . in the absence of galactic extinction",
    "both maffei 1 and ic 342 would subtend angles as large as the full moon ( mccall & buta 1996 ) .",
    "it is commonly believed that the local group ( lg ) of galaxies is dominated by the milky way and andromeda ( m31 ) .",
    "a discovery of an unknown andromeda - like galaxy behind the milky way may therefore dramatically change our understanding of the lg dynamics .",
    "kahn & woltjer ( 1959 ) and lynden - bell ( 1982 ) have shown that the distances and motions of nearby galaxies may be used to constrain the total mass of the pair milky way and m31 and the dynamical age of the local group .",
    "the method , known as `` local group timing '' , is based upon the assumption that m31 and the milky way separated from the hubble flow soon after formation and behaved dynamically like an isolated binary ever since , with the consequence that the milky way has turned in its orbit and is now falling back toward m31 .",
    "however , it seems that the dominant members of the ic 342/maffei group may be massive enough and near enough to the local group to have had an influence on its dynamical history ( mccall 1989 ; valtonen et al .",
    "1993 ) , thereby calling into question the binary hypothesis of lg timing .",
    "peebles ( 1990 ) and dunn & laflamme ( 1995 ) extended this approach by tracing the orbits of the lg galaxies back in time , under the `` least action principle '' .",
    "these analyses rely heavily on having a full census of lg galaxies and on accurate distances to them .",
    "therefore , better mapping of the zoa is important in two ways : ( a ) discovering new members of the lg and neighbouring groups ( or ruling out their existence ) ; ( b ) measuring the intrinsic properties of galaxies , properly corrected for extinction , to accurately estimate their distances .",
    "density enhancements locally decelerate the uniform expansion field , as observed within our own local supercluster , resulting in systematic streaming motions over and above the uniform expansion field .",
    "these flows , on the other hand , can be exploited to map the mass density field independent of the galaxy distribution and/or an assumption on the mass - to - light ratio using peculiar velocities of galaxies , @xmath34 , for which distance determinations independent of redshift are available .",
    "the latter can be obtained via the tully - fisher relation for spiral galaxies ( tully and fisher 1977 ) or the @xmath35 relation for elliptical galaxies ( lynden - bell et  al .",
    "note though , that only the radial component of the peculiar motion of a galaxy can be measured .",
    "the reconstruction of such potential fields and density fields have the advantage that they can locate hidden mass overdensities even if `` unseen '' .",
    "these methods are therefore of particular interest for zoa research , as these potential fields provide information on the mass distribution behind the milky way without having access to the real data on the galaxies hidden there .",
    "based on these considerations , dressler et  al .",
    "( 1987 ) interpreted a systematic infall pattern from the peculiar velocities of about 400 elliptical galaxies as being due to a hypothetical great attractor with a mass of @xmath36 at a position in redshift space of @xmath37  kms@xmath24 ) ( lynden - bell et  al .",
    "1988 ) . a more recent study by kolatt et  al . ( 1995 ) , based on a larger data set ( elliptical _ and _ spiral galaxies ) and the potential reconstruction method potent ( see sect .  [ recon ] and fig .  [ kolatt ] ) place the center of the ga right behind the milky way .",
    "recent consensus is that the ga is an extended region ( @xmath38 ) of moderately enhanced galaxy density .",
    "although there is a considerable excess of optical galaxies and iras - selected galaxies in this region ( see fig .",
    "[ ait ] and fig .  [ btp ] ) , no dominant cluster or central peak can been seen . but the central part of the ga is hidden by the milky way .",
    "large surveys ( e.g. mathewson et  al .",
    "1992 for field galaxies , mould et  al .",
    "1991 , han 1992 for clusters ) have resulted in a large collection of peculiar velocities of galaxies , put together in the mark iii catalog of peculiar velocities ( willick et  al .",
    "1997 ) . a large effort to obtain peculiar motions of a sample of uniform sky coverage ( excluding , however ,",
    "the zoa at @xmath39 ) is presented by giovanelli et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) and da costa et  al .",
    "this has opened up a new field in cosmology , namely the dynamics of cosmic flows or large - scale dynamics .",
    "a crucial step in exploring the extragalactic sky behind the zoa is a detailed understanding of our own galaxy , since it would otherwise remain impossible to disentangle newly unveiled clustering from the patchiness of the foreground extinction and , moreover , to correct the observed parameters of detected galaxies for the absorption effects .",
    "this requires ( a ) a high - resolution , well - calibrated map of the foreground extinction and ( b ) a clear understanding how galactic extinction affects the observed galaxy parameters .",
    "cameron ( 1990 ) investigated the latter in the optical by artificially obscuring high - latitude galaxies , an approach which really needs to be refined and to be explored at other wavelengths .",
    "the galactic foreground extinction is a function of wavelength . according to cardelli et  al .",
    "( 1989 ) , the mean extinction at a given wavelength , @xmath40 , compared to the visual extinction , @xmath41 , is : @xmath42 ( see mathis 1990 , for a comprehensive overview on the interstellar dust in the galaxy ) .",
    "the interstellar extinction is a function of the ratio of total to selective extinction , e.g. @xmath43 [ @xmath44 and the actual value depends on the environment along the line of sight through the galaxy . for the diffuse interstellar",
    "medium a standard value of @xmath45 applies , whereas a higher value of @xmath43 is evident for lines of sight through dense molecular clouds ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "but this ratio of total to selective extinction generally is founded upon observations of stars in the milky way , ignoring shifts in effective wavelengths which are known to depend upon reddening and intrinsic color . for galaxies",
    "heavily reddened by dust in the milky way , this approach can lead to significant errors in both magnitudes and distances ( mccall & armour 2000 ) .",
    "so the values for @xmath43 are by no means generally applicable .    for years , the extinction maps by burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) were the standard .",
    "but they do not cover the zoa ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "these maps can , however , be extrapolated towards lower latitudes , following the precepts of burstein & heiles ( 1978 , 1982 ) using the galactic hi  column densities @xmath48 ( e.g. from kerr et  al . 1986 for the south , and hartmann & burton 1997 for the north ) assuming a constant gas - to - dust ratio : @xmath49 however , the gas - to - dust ratio does vary .",
    "burstein et  al .",
    "( 1987 ) report , for instance , an increase in the gas - to - dust ratio for a region in the southern milky way ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) of up to a factor of 2 , implying severe overstimates of the extinction .",
    "moreover , close to the galactic plane ( @xmath52 ) , the galactic hi  line might be saturated , leading to an underestimate of the true extinction . at these latitudes",
    "though , the galactic co ( dame et  al . 1987 ) can be used as a tracer of extinction .",
    "the recently published 100  extinction maps from the dirbe experiment ( schlegel et  al .",
    "1998 ) give an improved estimate of the foreground extinction because they provide a direct measure of the dust column density , and because these maps have better angular resolution ( 6@xmath531 compared to @xmath54 of the himaps ) . according to schlegel et al .",
    ", they are a factor 2 better at low and moderate extinction compared to the burstein & heiles maps . however , as stated by schlegel et  al . themselves",
    ", the accuracy of the dirbe maps still needs to be established at low galactic latitudes ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "woudt ( 1998 ) found  from photometry and measurements of the mg@xmath56-index of 18 early type galaxies in the zoa  that the extinction for moderate to high dirbe reddenings is systematically underestimated ( by a factor of f=0.86 ) .",
    "as his new calibration so far is based only on few galaxies in a small region of the zoa , it seems too early to incorporate these adjustments to the dirbe maps .",
    "however , this study clearly illustrates the need for a careful calibration of the dirbe maps in the zoa .",
    "although the knowledge on the galactic foreground extinction has improved enormously in the last 20 years , many open points still need to be resolved before we can properly analyze the galaxy distribution uncovered in the zoa . on the other hand",
    ", a lot can be learned about total extinction from zoa research itself .",
    "as mentioned above , woudt ( 1998 ) has used photometry and spectroscopy of early - type galaxies in the zoa to obtain a first calibration of the dirbe maps in the zoa .",
    "he now has started a program to pursue this systematically for the southern milky way using a sample of about 300 early - type galaxies distributed within the southern zoa .",
    "furthermore , saito et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) have used @xmath57 colors of over a hundred galaxy candidates at extremely low latitudes ( @xmath58 ) in combination with co emission to determine extinction estimates , and temporin et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) determined total extinctions from @xmath59 photometry towards galaxies in the region @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , the colors of galaxies identified in the zoa with the near infrared surveys denis and 2mass ( see sect .",
    "[ nir ] ) will provide a huge data base to calibrate the dirbe maps at low galactic latitudes .",
    "systematic optical galaxy catalogs are generally limited to the largest galaxies ( typically with diameters d @xmath61 , e.g. lauberts 1982 ) .",
    "these catalogs become , however , increasingly incomplete as the dust thickens , creating a `` zone of avoidance '' in the distribution of galaxies of roughly 25% of the sky .",
    "systematically deeper searches for partially obscured galaxies  down to fainter magnitudes and smaller dimensions compared to existing catalogs  have been performed on existing sky surveys with the aim of reducing this zoa . meanwhile , through the efforts of various collaborations , nearly the whole zoa has been surveyed and over 50000 previously unknown galaxies were discovered in this way .",
    "these surveys are not biased with respect to any particular morphological type and were able to identify important new large - scale structures in and across the milky way .",
    "one of the first attempts to detect galaxies in the zoa was carried out by bhm - vitense in 1956 .",
    "she did follow - up observations in selected fields in the gp in which shane and wirtanen ( 1954 ) found objects that `` looked like extragalactic nebulae '' but were not believed to be galaxies because they were so close to the dust equator .",
    "she confirmed many galaxies and concluded that the obscuring matter in the gp must be extremely thin and full of holes between @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    because extinction was known to be low in puppis , fitzgerald ( 1974 ) performed a galaxy search in one field there ( @xmath64 ) and discovered 18 small and faint galaxies .",
    "two years later dodd & brand ( 1976 ) examined 3 fields adjacent to this area ( @xmath65 ) and detected another 29 galaxies .",
    "kraan - korteweg & huchtmeier ( 1992 ) observed these galaxies in hi  at effelsberg and identified an unknown nearby cluster at ( @xmath66  kms@xmath24 ) .",
    "including iras data in the analysis of this cluster , it could be shown that its density is comparable to the virgo cluster and that this puppis cluster may contribute a significant component to the motion of the lg ( lahav et  al .",
    "1993 ) .    during a search for infrared objects , weinberger et  al .",
    "( 1976 ) detected two galaxy candidates near the galactic plane ( @xmath67 ) which huchra et  al .",
    "confirmed in 1977 to be the brightest members of a galaxy cluster at 4200  kms@xmath24 .",
    "this discovery led weinberger ( 1980 ) to start the first _",
    "systematic _ galaxy search . using the poss e prints , he covered the whole northern gp ( @xmath68 ) in a thin strip @xmath69 .",
    "he found 207 galaxies , the distribution of which is highly irregular : large areas disclose no galaxies and the `` hole '' pointed out by bhm - vitense was verified , but most conspicuous was a huge excess of galaxies around @xmath70 . in 1984 , focardi et  al . made the connection with large - scale structures : they interpreted the excess as the possible continuation of the perseus - pisces cluster across the gp to the cluster a569 .",
    "radio - redshift measurements by hauschildt ( 1987 ) established that the pp cluster at a mean redshift of @xmath71  kms@xmath24  extends to the cluster 3c129 in the gp ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "additional hi  and optical redshift measurements of zwicky galaxies by chamaraux et  al .",
    "( 1990 ) indicate that this chain can be followed even further to the a569 cloud at @xmath73  kms@xmath24  on the other side of the zoa .",
    "these early searches proved that large - scale structure can be traced to much lower galactic latitudes despite the foreground obscuration and its patchy nature which suggests clustering in the galaxy distribution independent of large - scale structure .",
    "the above investigations did confirm suspected large - scale features across the gp through searches in selected regions and follow - up redshift observations . to study large - scale structure systematically broader latitude strips covering the whole milky way , respectively the whole zoa ( see fig .  [ ait ] ) are required .",
    "using existing sky surveys such as the first and second generation palomar observatory sky surveys poss i and poss ii in the north , and the eso / src ( united kingdom science research council ) southern sky atlas , various groups have performed systematic deep searches for `` partially obscured '' galaxies , i.e. they catalogued galaxies down to fainter magnitudes and smaller dimensions ( @xmath74 ) than existing catalogs . here ,",
    "examination by eye remains the best technique .",
    "a separation of galaxy and star images can not be done as yet on a viable basis below @xmath75 by automated measuring machines such as e.g. cosmos ( drinkwater et  al .",
    "1996 ) or apm ( lewis & irwin 1996 ) and sophisticated extraction algorithms , nor with the application of artificial neural networks [ ann ] .",
    "the latter was tested by naim ( 1995 ) who used ann to identify galaxies with diameters above 25@xmath76 at low galactic latitudes ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "galaxies could be identified using this algorithm , and although an acceptable hit rate for galaxies of 80  96% could be attained when ann was trained on high latitude fields , the false alarms were of equal order . using low latitude fields as training examples , the false alarms could be reduced to nearly zero but then the hit rate was low ( @xmath78 30 - 40% ) .",
    "the first attempts of using ann in the zoa are encouraging but clearly need further development .",
    "so , although surveys by eye are both tiring and time consuming , and maybe not as objective , they currently still provide the best technique to identify partially obscured galaxies in crowded star fields .",

    "( 1996 ) unveiled the cluster a3627 as being very rich and massive and at the correct distance .",
    "it hence is the most likely candidate for the central density peak of the ga .",
    "potent reconstructions have been applied to denser galaxy samples covering larger volumes ( 8 - 10000  kms@xmath24 ) with smoothing scales of the order of 500  kms@xmath24  ( compared to 1200  kms@xmath24 ) .",
    "it therefore seemed of interest to see whether these reconstructions find evidence for unknown major galaxy structures in the zoa at higher redshifts .    the currently most densely - sampled , well - defined galaxy redshift catalog is the optical redshift survey ( santiago et  al .",
    "however , this catalog is limited to @xmath362 and the reconstructions ( see baker et  al .",

    "1997 clearly show the recently identified nearby cluster at ( @xmath363,1500kms@xmath24 ; see sect .",

    "is seen by bistolas , but not by webster et  al .",
    "the perseus - pisces chain is strong in both reconstructions , and the second perseus - pisces arm  which folds back at @xmath364  is clearly confirmed .",
    "both reconstructions find the perseus - pisces complex to be very extended in space , i.e.  from 3500  kms@xmath24  out to 9000  kms@xmath24 . whereas the ga region is more prominent compared to perseus - pisces in the webster et  al .",
    "reconstructions , the signal of the perseus - pisces complex is considerably stronger than the ga in bistolas , where it does not even reveal a well - defined central density peak . both reconstructions find no evidence for the suspected cluster around pks1343@xmath143601 , but its signal could be hidden in the central ( a3627 ) density peak due to the smoothing . while the cygnus - lyra complex ( @xmath231  kms@xmath24 ) discovered by takata et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) stands out clearly in bistolas , it is not evident in webster et  al .",
    "both reconstructions find a strong signal for the vela scl ( @xmath136kms@xmath24 ) , labelled as hyd in webster et  al .",
    "the cen - crux cluster identified by woudt ( 1998 ) is evident in bistolas though less distinct in webster et  al . a suspected connection at ( @xmath365kms@xmath24",

    "[ vslice ] ) is supported by both methods .",
    "the ophiuchus cluster just becomes visible in the most distant reconstruction shells ( 8000  kms@xmath24 ) .",
    "not all reconstructions find the same features , and when they do , the prominence of the density peaks as well as their locations in space do vary considerably . at velocities of @xmath366",
    "kms@xmath24  most of the dominant structures happen to lie close to or within the zoa while at larger distances , clusters and voids seem to be more homogeneously distributed over the whole sky .",
    "out to 8000  kms@xmath24  none of the reconstructions predict any major structures which are not mapped or suggested from observational data .",
    "thus , no major surprises seem to remain hidden in the zoa . the various multi - wavelength explorations of the milky way will soon be able to verify this .",
    "still , the combination of both the reconstructed potential fields and the observationally mapped galaxy distribution will lead to estimates of the cosmological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in the last decade , enormous progress has been made in unveiling the extragalactic sky behind the milky way . at optical wavebands ,",
    "the entire zoa has been systematically surveyed .",
    "it has been shown that these surveys are complete for galaxies larger than @xmath367 ( corrected for absorption ) down to extinction levels of @xmath368 .",
    "combining these data with previous `` whole - sky '' maps reduces the `` optical zoa '' by a factor of about 2 - 2.5 , which allows an improved understanding of the velocity flow fields and the total gravitational attraction on the local group .",
    "various previously unknown structures in the nearby universe could be mapped in this way .    at higher extinction levels , other windows to the zoa become more efficient in tracing the large - scale structures .",
    "very promising in this respect are the current near - infrared surveys which find galaxies down to latitudes of @xmath369 .",
    "source confusion will remain a problem at low galactic latitude which may be overcome by introducing novel statistical methods such as artificial neural networks .",
    "the systematic hi  surveys detect gas - rich spiral galaxies all the way across the galactic plane  slightly hampered only at very low latitudes ( @xmath370 ) because of the numerous continuum sources .",
    "these studies have already shown that no unknown dynamically important , hi - rich nearby galaxies whose gravitational influence could significantly impact the internal dynamics and the peculiar motion of the local group are hidden by the milky way . in addition , the deep zoa hi  surveys can be merged with the lower - sensitivity whole - sky hi - surveys currently in progress .",
    "the `` behind the plane '' survey resulted in a reduction from 16% to 7% of the `` fir zoa '' which soon should provide improved values of the dipole direction and convergence from iras data .",
    "in addition , new indications of possible hidden massive clusters behind the miky way are now forthcoming from the ciza project ",
    "although again an `` x - ray zoa '' will remain due to the absorption of x - ray radiation by the thick gas layer close to the galactic plane .",
    "a difficult task is still awaiting us , i.e. to obtain a detailed understanding of the selection effects inherent to the various methods . quantifying the selection effects",
    "is crucial for any optimal reconstruction method ( e.g. wiener ) which attempts to merge the different data sets in an unbiased way .",
    "this is extremely important if we want to use these data for quantitative cosmography .",
    "moreover , we need a better understanding of the effects of obscuration on the observed properties of galaxies identified through the dust layer ( at all wavelengths ) , in addition to an accurate high - resolution , well - calibrated map of the galactic extinction .    despite the fact that our knowledge about the above issues is as yet limited , a lot can and has been learned from zoa research .",
    "this is evident , for instance , from the detailed and varied investigations of the great attractor region .",
    "mapping the ga and understanding the massive overdensity inferred from peculiar velocity fields had remained an enigma due the fact that the major and central part of this extended density enhancement was largely hidden by the obscuring veil of the milky way .",
    "the results from the various zoa surveys now clearly imply that the great attractor is , in fact , a nearby `` great - wall '' like supercluster , starting at the nearby pavo cluster below the gp , moving across the massive galaxy cluster a3627 toward the shallow overdensity in vela at 6000  kms@xmath24 .",
    "the cluster a3627 is the dominant central component of this structure , similar to the coma cluster in the ( northern ) great wall .",
    "whether a second massive cluster around pks1343@xmath143601 is part of the core of the ga remains uncertain .",

    "the derivation of the wf given above follows from the sole requirement of minimum variance and requires only a model for the variance of the signal and noise .",
    "the wf can also be derived using the laws of conditional probability if the underlying distribution functions for the signal and noise are assumed to be gaussian ; in this more restrictive case , the wf estimate is , in addition to being the minimum variance estimate , also both the maximum a _ posterior _ estimate and the mean field . for gaussian fields ,",
    "the mean wf field can be supplemented with a realization of the expected scatter about the mean field to create a realization of the field ; this is the heart of the `` constrained realization '' approach described in hoffman & ribak ( 1991 ) .",
