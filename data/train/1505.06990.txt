    "we have used the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( @xcite ) to carry out a survey for x - ray emission from the radio jets of 54 flat - spectrum radio quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the parent sample consists of flat - spectrum radio sources with 5 ghz flux density greater than 1 jy , taken from @xcite based on vla observations , or with a flux density at 2.7 ghz greater than 0.34 jy from atca observations by @xcite .",
    "we considered only jets longer than 2  projected on the sky in order to resolve multiple regions with the half - arcsec resolution of the _ chandra _ x - ray telescope .",
    "from that parent population we selected objects for which either we predicted an x - ray detection in a 5 ks observation , or which had a one - sided linear radio morphology .",
    "those two selection criteria were motivated by the serendipitous _ chandra _ observation of pks 0637 - 752 ( @xcite ) , scaling the predictions of x - ray flux from the x - ray to radio jet ratio for that object , and considering that one - sided linear morphology might indicate bulk relativistic motion . such a relativistically beamed jet was the basis of the interpretations of the pks 0637 x - ray emission as inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the following section presents model - independent correlations derived directly from the data .",
    "the final section examines what we can learn by modeling the jet x - ray emission as inverse compton scattering of electrons by the cosmic microwave background in a relativistic jet beamed nearly at our line of sight . in both studies we consider only the straight portion of the jet from the quasar out to a large apparent angular bend ( where typically the x - rays disappear ) , and",
    "do not include the terminal hotspot or radio lobe . since the lifetimes of the radio jets are inferred to be relatively short , 10@xmath1 years",
    ", the regions we are sampling may be somewhat heterogeneous due to differing ages .     from the jet and from the quasar .",
    "the data include only the initial `` snapshot '' observation , of 5 to 10 ks duration .",
    "thirty - one of the 54 observations are considered a firm detection of x - rays from the jet .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows raw counting rates in the jet region vs. the quasar core region .",
    "all observations were targeted on acis - s3 , and level 2 counts were taken in the 0.5 to 7 kev band .",
    "for photon power law spectral indices in the range 1 to 2 , 1 count ks@xmath2 is approximately 0.94 njy at 1 kev , or 2.2 @xmath3 10@xmath4 erg @xmath5 s@xmath2 in the 0.5 to 7 kev band . for the jet region we used a 2  wide rectangle drawn on a ds9 ( @xcite ) plot of an l , c , or k band radio image .",
    "the length was extended to include the straight part of the radio image but ended before any terminal hot spot or lobe .",
    "the quasar core was taken to be a circle of 126 radius .",
    "the correlation shows a large scatter , with a correlation coefficient only 0.43 , but which has a probability less than 10@xmath6 of no correlation .",
    "one might expect that the power in the jet is correlated with the energy release at the black hole , hence explaining fig .",
    "however since these fr ii jets are almost certainly relativistically beamed , their apparent radiative output will vary widely with the angle to our line of sight , and should not show a correlation to any isotropic source of radiation .",
    "the x - ray to optical ratio for radio loud quasars has been known to be larger than for radio quiet quasars and even more so for flat - spectrum radio quasars ( @xcite ) , so the present correlation may present new evidence that the quasar core has an x - ray component that is beamed in the direction of the kpc jet .",
    "a simple least squares fit of the jet counting rate to the quasar counting rate gives a mean proportionality constant 1.1% @xmath7 0.3% , to 95% confidence , and with a scatter about a factor of 2.5 .",
    "even if both the jet and quasar core are beamed , the scatter would be expected to be large since the detailed emission mechanisms , ( e.g. , target photons from compton scattering and/or contribution from synchrotron radiation ) should be different .",
    "other relations to the x - ray flux are shown in fig .",
    "there does not appear to be any correlation with redshift or optical magnitude .",
    "the x - rays may correlate to the radio core flux density , but the present figure is dominated by the half dozen points at @xmath8 100 and @xmath910@xmath10 mjy .",
    "correlation would be expected simply from the fact that the quasar core x - ray flux increases with the radio ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the predicted x - ray flux based on the ratio of the x - ray to radio jet in pks 0637 - 752 , ( shown as the dashed line in the lower left panel ) has served well to detect x - rays from @xmath11 60% of our jet sample , the scatter is very large with no obvious correlation .",
    "for almost every jet where optical data exist , the optical flux or upper limit does not allow the jet x - ray spectrum to be an extension of the synchrotron radio spectrum of the jet .",
    "although exceptions exist , this has led to the general interpretation of the x - ray emission as inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "we apply the formalism previously used by @xcite , based on work by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , we assume minimum - energy conditions producing the radio synchrotron emission , with a low energy cutoff to the electron spectrum at lorentz factor @xmath12=30 , and with relativistic beaming so that the energy density of the cmb is enhanced by a factor @xmath13 in the jet rest frame .",
    "we use the supersnapshot formalism discussed in @xcite to calculate the rest frame volume as v = v@xmath14 .",
    "further assumptions must be made to break the degeneracy between the doppler beaming factor , @xmath15 , the bulk lorentz factor of the jet , @xmath16 , and the angle @xmath17 to the observer s line of sight .",
    "the electron spectrum producing the radio synchrotron is assumed to extend to sufficiently low energies to produce the x - rays .",
    "roughly , @xmath18 1000/@xmath19 produces 1 kev x - rays . for pks 0637 - 752 , @xcite",
    "show that @xmath20 70 to produce the lowest energy x - rays ; consistent with our choice of @xmath12=30 .",
    "we assume homogeneity and isotropy for the particles and magnetic fields in the jet rest frame .    for an initial evaluation of the entire sample ,",
    "we have taken @xmath19=@xmath16 .",
    "this places the jet at the largest allowed angle for the given value of @xmath19 , @xmath21=1/@xmath19 . for this case ,",
    "the photons seen by the observer are emitted in the jet frame perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the jet , and v = v@xmath22 .",
    "it also implies @xmath19 is half its maximum possible value of 2@xmath16 , which is approached for large @xmath16 and small @xmath17 .",
    "[ fig3 ] summarizes the results for the 31 detected jets . for these values",
    "we have also assumed equal kinetic energy in relativistic protons and electrons , and equal number density of protons and electrons , which can both be satisfied since we have no constraints on the proton spectral shape .",
    "we can summarize the sample properties as @xmath23 10 , magnetic field strength @xmath11 1020 @xmath24 g ( 12 ntesla ) , electron density @xmath11 10@xmath25 @xmath26 and enthalpy flux @xmath11 ( 510 ) @xmath3 10@xmath27 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "[ fig4 ] plots the derived quantities vs. a proxy for black hole mass .",
    "the mass estimate is taken from the relation in @xcite : m@xmath28=10@xmath29l@xmath30l@xmath31 , where l@xmath32 is the radio luminosity of the quasar in units of 10@xmath33 erg s@xmath2 and l@xmath34 is the quasar x - ray luminosity in units of 10@xmath35erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the magnetic field strength , electron density ( which is forced to be proportional to the magnetic field energy density by the minimum energy assumption ) , and enthalpy flux all correlate to the black hole mass proxy .",
    "this is due at least in part to the correlation of the jet and quasar x - ray flux , since the latter enters the equation for the mass proxy .",
    "assuming positrons , rather than protons , provide charge neutrality in the jet lowers the estimates of the enthalpy flux by a factor of about 5 . in either case the energy flux carried by the jet is comparable to the radiative luminosity , or at least a significant component of the accretion energy budget .",
    "other derived quantities depend only slightly on the positive charge carrier , typically decreasing about 20% from all protons ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) to all positrons .",
    "this research has made use of saoimage ds9 , developed by smithsonian astrophysical observatory , of nasa s astrophysics data system , and of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "support for this work was provided in part by the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) through the smithsonian astrophysical observatory ( sao ) contract sv3 - 73016 to mit for support of the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) , which is operated by sao for and on behalf of nasa under contract nas8 - 03060 .",
    "support was also provided by nasa under contract nas 8 - 39073 to sao , and by grants",
