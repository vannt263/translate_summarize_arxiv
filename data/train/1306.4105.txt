    "the layered organic material 3 ( ai3 ) , which has been studied since the 1980s,@xcite has recently attracted renewed interest because it reveals low - energy massless dirac fermions under hyrdostatic pressure ( @xmath2 gpa).@xcite compared to graphene , certainly the most popular material with low - energy dirac fermions@xcite or electronic states at the surface of three - dimensional topological insulators,@xcite ai3 is strikingly different in several respects .",
    "apart from the tilt of the dirac cones and the anisotropy in the fermi surface,@xcite its average fermi velocity is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than that in graphene .",
    "this , together with an experimentally identified low - temperature charge - ordered phase at ambient pressure,@xcite indicates the relevance of electronic correlations .",
    "indeed , because the effective coupling constant for coulomb - type electron - electron interactions is inversely proportional to the fermi velocity , it is expected to be ten times larger in ai3 than in graphene .",
    "the material ai3 thus opens the exciting prospective to study strongly - correlated dirac fermions that are beyond the scope of graphene electrons.@xcite .",
    "another specificity of ai3 is the presence of additional massive carriers in the vicinity of the fermi level , as recently pointed out in ab - initio band - structure calculations.@xcite however , the interplay between massless dirac fermions and massive carriers has , to the best of our knowledge , not yet been proven experimentally .",
    "finally , one should mention a topological merging of dirac points that is expected for high but experimentally accessible pressure.@xcite    here , we present magneto - transport measurements of ai3 crystals under hydrostatic pressure larger than @xmath3 gpa where dirac carriers are present .",
    "we show not only the existence of high - mobility dirac carriers as reported elsewhere,@xcite but we prove also experimentally the presence of low - mobility massive holes , in agreement with recent band - structure calculations.@xcite the interplay between both carrier types at low energy is the main result of our studies .",
    "furthermore , we show that the measured mobilities for the two carrier types hint at scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short - range scatterers .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] , we present the experimental set - up and the results of the magneto - transport measurements ( sec .",
    "[ sec:1.1 ] ) under hydrostatic pressure .",
    "the subsection [ sec:1.2 ] is devoted to a discussion of the temperature dependence of the carrier densities , in comparison with the model of ( a ) massless dirac fermions and ( b ) massive carriers .",
    "furthermore thermopower measurements are presented to corroborate the two - carrier scenario .",
    "the measured temperature dependence of the extracted carrier mobilities is exposed in sec .",
    "[ sec:1.3 ] , and a theoretical discussion of the experimental results , in terms of short - range ( such as screened coulomb ) scatterers may be found in sec .",

    "the single crystals of ai3 used in our study have been synthesized by electro - crystallization .",
    "their typical size is @xmath4 mm@xmath5 ( @xmath6 plane ) x @xmath7 m ( @xmath8 direction ) .",
    "six @xmath9 nm thick gold contacts were deposited by joule evaporation on both sides of the sample , allowing for simultaneous longitudinal and transverse resistivity measurements .",
    "a picture of one of the three samples studied is shown in the inset of figure [ magneto ] .",
    "the resistivities were measured using a low - frequency ac lock - in technique .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath10 , oriented along the @xmath8 axis , was swept between @xmath11 and @xmath12 t at constant temperature between @xmath13 and @xmath3 k. to account for alignment mismatch of patterned contacts , the longitudinal ( transverse ) resistivity has been symmetrized ( anti - symmetrized ) with respect to the orientation of @xmath10 to obtain even [ @xmath14 and odd [ @xmath15 functions respectively .",
    "hydrostatic pressure was applied at room temperature in a nicral clamp cell using daphne 7373 silicone oil as the pressure transmitting medium .",
    "the pressure was determined , at room temperature , using a manganine resistance gauge located in the pressure cell close to the sample .",
    "the values given below take into account the pressure decrease during cooling .",
    "the analysis of our data is based on the study of the magneto - conductivity and is similar to the one presented in ref . for multi - carrier semiconductor systems .",
    "the magneto - conductivity is obtained from the measured resistivity tensor by means of @xmath16 $ ] . for a single carrier system , its analytical expression reads@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the electron charge , @xmath20 the mobility , and @xmath21 is the carrier density .",

    "the strong temperature dependence of the carrier density is a signature that temperature is higher than @xmath35 for both a and b carriers even at the lowest measured temperature , @xmath36 k. this low fermi temperature hints at the absence of charge inhomogeneities that prevent the approach of the dirac point in graphene on si0@xmath37 substrates.@xcite      the carrier density can be calculated from @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the fermi - dirac distribution and @xmath40 is the density of states for massive ( @xmath41 ) and dirac ( @xmath42 ) carriers:@xcite     gpa for different temperatures , from bottom to top : @xmath3 , @xmath43 , @xmath34 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 k. the left axis shows the square ( 2d ) conductivity of each bedt - ttf plane while the right axis shows the `` bulk '' ( 3d ) longitudinal conductivity . ]",

    "the continuous lines represent power laws fits for the mobilities dependences with temperature , which gives exponents @xmath55 ( a carriers ) and @xmath56 ( b carriers ) .",
    "the low temperature dispersion of a carriers mobility is due to a decrease of the saturating mobility ( dotted line ) by increasing pressure . ]",
    "@xmath57    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are valley and spin degeneracies and @xmath61 is the effective mass of massive carriers described by a schrdinger equation . in ai3 under pressure ,",
    "two dirac cones but only one massive band exist at the fermi level.@xcite for large temperatures , @xmath62 , the carrier density depends linearly on temperature for massive carriers and quadratically for dirac carriers :    @xmath63    @xmath64    figure [ density ] represents the measured temperature dependence of the mobilities and reveals a power - law behavior , @xmath65 .",
    "indeed one obtains an exponent of @xmath66 for the low - mobility carriers ( b ) , in good agreement with what [ eq .",
    "( [ nmassif ] ) ] expected for massive carriers , whereas one finds @xmath67 for the high - mobility carriers ( a ) , as roughly expected for massless dirac particles [ eq . ( [ ndirac ] ) ] .",
    "besides , the nature of the carriers can be extracted from hall measurements .",
    "furthermore , we have performed thermopower measurements under pressure on a second sample ( figure [ thermopower ] ) .",
    "these data show a sign change for the seebeck coefficient ( s ) around 5k .",
    "thermopower is the voltage per unit of temperature produced by a thermal gradient .",
    "the carrier type determines the sign while the density and mobility of the carriers establish the amplitude .",
    "thus , a sign change of the thermopower indicates that the relevant carriers at low temperature have a different charge than those at high temperature , requiring a two - carrier scenario .        in agreement with ref .",
    ", a carriers which dominate the low - field conduction are electrons . on the contrary , at large fields",
    "the conduction is dominated by holes ( b carriers ) .",
    "notice that our results are consistent with ab - initio calculations of the band structure of ai3 under a pressure of @xmath68 gpa ( inset of figure [ density])@xcite and do not depend on pressure ( within the range @xmath69 gpa ) .",
    "this supports the idea that massless and massive particles coexist in a broad pressure range",
    ". however , since @xmath70 in the whole temperature range under study , both dirac electrons and dirac holes are excited .",
    "thus there are indeed not two but three carrier types : dirac holes , dirac electrons and massive electrons . for @xmath62 ,",
    "the electron and hole densities are actually identical ( semimetal with symmetric band structure ) : @xmath71 .",
    "the absence of a third ` plateau ' in the magneto - conductivity data allows us to consider that dirac electrons and holes have roughly the same mobilities : @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the results obtained in figure [ density ] and [ mobility ] still hold when we consider two types of dirac carriers ( electrons and holes ) in addition to the massive holes .",
    "this analysis allows us to avoid using hall effect measurements for the determination of carrier densities . indeed , hall effect interpretation becomes challenging as dirac electron and hole contributions partially compensate , leading to the determination of only an ` effective ' dirac carrier density , and they are both mixed with massive carriers contribution .",
    "this problem is solved here by analyzing the magneto - conductivity where all carriers contributions are additive .",
    "the effective mass of the massive carriers has been extracted from eq .",
    "( [ nmassif ] ) .",
    "the obtained value is quite small @xmath73 ( @xmath74 is the free electron mass ) .",
    "meanwhile , from eq .",
    "( [ ndirac ] ) , @xmath75 m / s can be extracted , in agreement with previous theoretica@xcite and experimental estimates.@xcite in fig . [ density ] , no significant variation of this argument is observed upon sweeping pressure ( which should appear as a vertical shift of the @xmath76 line ) .",
    "this indicates that @xmath77 does not change with pressure . in principle",
    ", pressure should enhance hopping while reducing the unit cell volume .",
    "thus , an enhancement of the @xmath77 with pressure could be expected according to the approximate expression @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the hopping integral .",
    "this expression can be simplified by means of harrison s law ( @xmath80 ) into @xmath81 . as pressure slightly modifies the lattice constant ( @xmath82gpa @xcite )",
    ", @xmath77 is expected to vary by the same order of magnitude which is smaller than our current experimental uncertainty .",
    "this accounts for the apparent absence of pressure effects on the carrier density in the range @xmath83 gpa .    in fig .",
    "[ mobility ] , the mobility of the dirac carriers ( a ) reaches @xmath84 cm@xmath5/vs at low temperatures ( @xmath86 k ) , a value comparable to already published values.@xcite it is quite high compared to typical graphene on 2 values ( @xmath87 to @xmath88 cm@xmath5/vs ) but similar to suspended graphene and graphene on bn mobilities at very low carrier density.@xcite on the other hand , the mobility for massive carriers is @xmath89 cm@xmath5/vs at @xmath86 k , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than for dirac carriers .",
    "the temperature dependence of the mobility follows power laws for both massive ( exponent @xmath56 ) and dirac carriers ( exponent @xmath55 ) .",
    "moreover , the dirac carrier mobility seems to saturate at @xmath90 .",
    "a similar saturation has been reported in others dirac systems.@xcite table [ tabcomp ] summarizes the main parameters of massive and dirac carriers in ai3 , in comparison with graphene on 2 .",
    ".dirac and massive carriers parameters in ai3 at high pressure , in comparison with graphene electrons . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order to better understand the difference in the mobility , we investigate the ratio @xmath91 , in terms of the scattering times @xmath92 and @xmath93 for the massless dirac and massive carriers , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath94 is the density - dependent cyclotron mass of the dirac carriers , in terms of the fermi energy @xmath95 .",
    "the scattering times may be obtained from fermi s golden rule ( for @xmath96 ) @xmath97 in terms of the impurity density @xmath98 , the matrix element @xmath99 , and the density of states ( [ ddirac ] ) for dirac and ( [ dmassif ] ) for massive carriers .",
    "we consider implicitly that both carrier types are affected by the same impurities , and the matrix element is independent of @xmath100 for short - range impurity scattering .",
    "apart from atomic defects , screened coulomb - type impurities approximately fulfill this condition , as it may be seen within the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation .",
    "indeed , the screening length of the coulomb interaction is dominated by the thomas - fermi wave vector @xmath101 m@xmath102 of the massive carriers , for an effective bohr radius @xmath103 , whereas the thomas - fermi wave vector for massless dirac carriers @xmath104 m@xmath102 , for a density @xmath105 cm@xmath102 and a fine - structure constant @xmath107 .",
    "the thomas - fermi wave vector is thus roughly one order of magnitude larger than the fermi wave vector of the massive carriers , which is itself much larger than that of the dirac carriers .",
    "the screened coulomb potential for @xmath100-type carriers may therefore be approximated by its @xmath108 value , @xmath109 , which is thus the same for both carrier types , as mentioned above .",
    "here , @xmath110 is the permittivity of the dielectric environment and @xmath111 is the dielectric function calculated within the thomas - fermi approximation .    in view of the above considerations , we thus obtain , for the mobility ratio in the limit @xmath112 @xmath113 which does neither depend on the form of the matrix element nor on the impurity density .",
    "one expects a ratio in the @xmath114 range , whereas the measured ratio is @xmath115 at @xmath116 k. notice that for @xmath62 , that is in the experimentally relevant regime here , one may replace the energy dependence in the density of states of the massless dirac carriers by a linear dependence in temperature , @xmath117 , such that one expects a linear temperature dependence of the mobility ratio ( [ eq : mu ] ) , in agreement with our experimental findings ( @xmath118 for @xmath119 , see fig . [ mobility ] ) .",
    "to conclude , we present an interpretation of magneto - transport in ai3 that indicates that both massive and dirac carriers are present even at high pressures . thermopower measurements performed on one of the three studied samples are also in agreement with this two carrier scenario .",
    "so far in the literature , the conduction in this system has been attributed solely to dirac carriers.@xcite moreover , this coexistence holds with little perturbation in the whole range of pressure under study . as dirac carriers have high mobility , they dominate the conduction at low magnetic field and high temperatures . on the contrary , for high magnetic fields and low temperatures ,",
    "the massive holes drive the conduction properties .",
    "this crossover can be clearly seen from our magneto - conductivity curves and is responsible for their peculiar ` plateau ' shape .",
    "it should also be noted that a proper separation of massive carriers has to be done prior to using any expression that concerns solely dirac carriers . in order to confirm the picture of coexisting dirac and massive carriers , complementary studies , such as spectroscopic measurements ,",
    "are highly desirable but beyond the scope of the present paper .",
