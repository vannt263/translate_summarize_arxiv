    "the su@xmath0-valued field @xmath5 is required to attain its vacuum value , the identity , at spatial infinity and , so , it is a map between topological three - spheres .",
    "this is the origin of the topological charge , @xmath6 .",
    "the 1-skyrmion is spherical and is given by the hedgehog ansatz @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the outward pointing unit normal and @xmath9 are the pauli matrices .",
    "@xmath10 is a shape function and is usually determined numerically .",
    "it is very well approximated by the kink profile @xcite : @xmath11 .",
    "the 1-skyrmion has six zero modes : three translational modes and three isospin modes corresponding to global su@xmath0 transformations .",
    "two well - separated skyrmions attract or repel , depending upon their mutual isospin orientation .",
    "two attracting 1-skyrmions will move towards each other and form a bound state whose energy is @xmath12 times the energy of two 1-skyrmions .",
    "this 2-skyrmion is torus shaped @xcite and is axially symmetric , in the sense that axial rotations in space are equivalent to isospin rotations , which are conjugations of @xmath5 by a constant su@xmath0 matrix .    in the skyrme model ,",
    "the classical @xmath6-nucleon nucleus is a @xmath6-skyrmion ; that is , a minimum energy skyrme field with topological charge @xmath6 . for @xmath6 from three to 22 , the skyrmion has been calculated numerically by evolving an attractive configuration , @xcite .",
    "all the known skyrmions have the bulk of their energy density on a fullerene - like shell .",
    "a geometric interpretation of this shell - like structure was given in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , skyrmions often have a very symmetrical shape .",
    "the rational map ansatz introduced in @xcite is a simple ansatz for skyrmions .",
    "it is similar to the 1-skyrmion ( [ hh ] ) .",
    "the 1-skyrmion is a hedgehog map in which the outward pointing unit normal , @xmath13 , maps a two - sphere identically to a two - sphere . in the ansatz ,",
    "the hedgehog map is replaced by a more general holomorphic map , @xmath14 , from riemann sphere to riemann sphere .",
    "the rational map ansatz is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a holomorphic map in @xmath18 .",
    "here , @xmath18 is related to the standard angular coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 by the stereographic projection @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is also a stereographic coordinate on the riemann sphere . in the ansatz ,",
    "this riemann sphere is a latitudinal two - sphere in su@xmath23 .",
    "the ansatz maps spheres around the origin in space to latitudinal two - spheres in su@xmath0 .",
    "the shape function @xmath24 is a function of @xmath25 only , so each map between two - spheres is identical .",
    "the boundary conditions on @xmath24 are @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "these conditions are determined by requiring that @xmath5 is well defined at the origin and attains the vacuum value at infinity . in principle , we could have @xmath28 for any non - zero integer @xmath29 , but solutions with @xmath30 have rather high energy and so we only consider @xmath31 .    thus , the ansatz depends on a holomorphic map between two - spheres .",
    "any holomorphic map of finite topological charge can be written as a rational map @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are polynomials in @xmath18 .",
    "the topological charge , @xmath35 , of the map is equal to the algebraic degree and this , in turn , is given by the maximal degree of the two polynomials .    the easiest way to calculate",
    "the energy of an ansatz field is to use the geometric formulation of the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "a skyrme field is a map between three - manifolds with metrics and so there is a strain tensor .",
    "this is given by @xmath36 the static energy , @xmath37 , and the baryon number , @xmath6 , of a skyrme field can be written in terms of the eigenvalues , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , of this tensor : @xmath41 the strain tensor of the ansatz field ( [ ansatz ] ) can be calculated to give @xmath42 where @xmath35 is the degree of the rational map .",
    "similarly , the energy @xmath37 is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 thus , the minimum energy ansatz field is found by choosing polynomials @xmath33 and @xmath34 which minimize @xmath45 and then calculating the shape function @xmath24 numerically .",
    "these minimum energy ansatz fields have been calculated for all the known skyrmions and are found to have energies that exceed the true , numerically determined , minima @xcite by less than three percent .",
    "the accuracy of the ansatz is established by observing how close in energy the minimum energy ansatz configurations are to the true minima . in other words , it is not known whether the ansatz fields resemble the true fields in regions where the energy density is low .",
    "in fact , for the approximate fields calculated within the ansatz , the region of zero baryon density has a rather special structure .",
    "there are @xmath46 radial half - lines which meet at the origin and extend out to infinity .",
    "the zeros of the baryon density correspond to the folds in the skyrme fields , considered as maps between three - spheres .",
    "line - like zeros are not generic .",
    "it is possible that these non - generic zeros are a natural consequence of minimizing the skyrme energy @xcite .",
    "however , it may be that this is a weakness of the rational map ansatz and skyrmions have a more generic folding structure .    if it is a weakness , it is not a very serious one .",
    "most current interest is in finding minimum energy skyrme configurations .",
    "however , the issue of determining the structure of skyrme fields in the regions where there is little energy may be of some practical importance , for example , in calculations in which the skyrmion fields are used as backgrounds for fermion excitations modeling heavy flavours , see @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the consequences of generalizing the rational map ansatz to include a larger class of maps .",
    "these maps permit a more natural , though not wholly generic , folding structure .",
    "this generalized ansatz is not as convenient as the original one .",
    "however , it does result in ansatz fields which are even closer to the true minima .",
    "our interest in this problem is partly motivated by bps monopoles .",
    "there are many interesting similarities between skyrmions and bps monopoles .",
    "for example , there are two rational map descriptions of monopoles @xcite , and it is widely believed that the space of attracting skyrmions is related to the space of monopoles .",
    "it was discovered in @xcite that the tetrahedral 3-monopole has a negative multiplicity higgs zero .",
    "subsequent examination revealed that the octahedral 5-monopole also has extra zeros but the cubic 4-monopole does not @xcite .",
    "there is evidence that this pattern is mimicked by skyrmions for @xmath47 and 4 .",
    "these skyrmions were studied in @xcite using the atiyah - manton ansatz @xcite .",
    "it was observed that there is no negative baryon density in the approximate 4-skyrmion , but there is in the approximate 3-skyrmion case . in the approximate 3-skyrmion",
    "there is a region of negative baryon density surrounding the origin .",
    "this extends out along four thin tubes which twice pinch to points and then widen at very large distance until they merge and form another region of negative baryon density at spatial infinity .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the rational map ansatz so that there can be negative baryon density .",
    "we calculate ansatz fields that approximate the true minima more closely than the original rational map ansatz .",
    "the ansatz for the 3-skyrmion has tubes of negative baryon density extending out from the origin ; the ansatz for the 4-skyrmion does not .",
    "furthermore , there is an octahedrally symmetric @xmath48 saddle - point configuration .",
    "the ansatz for this saddle point also has negative baryon density .",
    "thus , our investigation adds to the evidence that there may be regions of negative baryon density in certain skyrmions .",
    "this occurs in those examples where the corresponding monopole has negative multiplicity higgs zeros .",
    "of course , our conclusions are based on an ansatz and the true solution does not necessarily possess the same singularity structure . unfortunately , it is difficult to observe negative baryon density directly in the numerical solutions .      the theory of singularities deals with smooth maps between manifolds .",
    "one of its main aims is to classify the points where the jacobian of a map does not have maximal rank .",
    "these are the singularities .",
    "some singularities are unstable , in the sense that a small perturbation of the map can alter the nature of the singularity . for maps between low dimensional manifolds ,",
    "there is only a small number of stable singularities . in this section",
    ", we describe the three stable singularities of smooth maps between three - dimensional manifolds .",
    "we will follow @xcite .",
    "let @xmath49 be a map from a three - dimensional manifold @xmath50 to a three - dimensional manifold @xmath51 .",
    "locally , there are coordinates @xmath52 on @xmath51 and @xmath53 on @xmath50 so that @xmath54 the matrix @xmath55 is the jacobian matrix of the map .",
    "the singularities are the points where det@xmath56 .",
    "there are only three stable singularities : folds , cusps and swallowtails .",
    "these are described by giving their normal forms .",
    "the normal form is a standard choice of coordinates for the neighbourhood of the singularity .",
    "any stable singularity can be expressed locally in terms of the corresponding normal form by a smooth change of variables .",
    "the simplest singularity is the fold , which can be visualized as the line along which a piece of paper has been folded .",
    "a fold has the normal form : @xmath57 it is worth considering the number of preimages of the map .",
    "for points of @xmath51 with @xmath58 there are two preimages , whereas for points with @xmath59 there are no preimages .",
    "the fold is located at @xmath60 , which has one preimage .",
    "restricted to the set of points @xmath61 , @xmath24 maps the @xmath62-plane onto the @xmath63-plane .",
    "the jacobian matrix of this map is : @xmath64 it is singular at @xmath65 , which , of course , is the location of the fold .",
    "the rank of the jacobian matrix at the fold is two .",
    "in fact , this is true of all three stable singularities .",
    "any singularity with a rank one or rank zero jacobian matrix is unstable .",
    "two folds can end on a cusp .",
    "this has the normal form : @xmath66 in order to get a better understanding of this singularity , we calculate the jacobian matrix : @xmath67 @xmath68 does not have maximal rank for @xmath69 .",
    "this is a pair of folds .",
    "the cusp occurs at the line @xmath70 where the two folding surfaces @xmath71 meet .",
    "the most complicated stable singularity is called the swallowtail and its normal form is @xmath72 in this case , the jacobian matrix is given by @xmath73 the points of the folds satisfy the equation @xmath74 .",
    "the folds meet to form four cusp lines which meet at the origin .",
    "the origin is the swallowtail .",
    "this classification is known as whitney s theorem .",
    "this theorem states that a map of a three - dimensional manifold to a three - dimensional manifold is stable at a point if , and only if , the map can be described in local coordinates in one of the four forms : a regular point with @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 or one of the three singular forms given above .",
    "furthermore , maps with stable singularities are dense in the space of all smooth maps : any map can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a map with stable singularities .",
    "we begin this section by showing that the simplest singularity of the rational map ansatz is unstable .",
    "this will lead us to introduce the non - holomorphic rational map ansatz in the following section .",
    "furthermore , we show that for @xmath78 there is an unstable singularity at the origin .    in the holomorphic rational map ansatz",
    "there is a map from @xmath79 to @xmath80 which maps @xmath81 to @xmath82 .",
    "away from the origin , we can define local coordinates @xmath83 and @xmath52 such that @xmath84 the simplest rational map with a singularity is @xmath85 which gives @xmath86 the jacobian matrix has rank one for the line @xmath70 .",
    "this is not one of the stable singularities .",
    "let us consider small perturbations around ( [ rcomplex ] ) .",
    "adding terms proportional to @xmath18 only shifts the singularity .",
    "therefore , we consider the following map : @xmath87 since multiplying @xmath88 by a phase @xmath89 only rotates the singularities by @xmath19 , we can take @xmath88 to be real . using real coordinates ,",
    "the jacobian matrix can be written as : @xmath90 the jacobian matrix is singular for @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the singular points lie on a cylinder with radius @xmath88 .",
    "they can be parametrized by @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 $ ] , @xmath95 is arbitrary . restricting the map to the singular surface , labeled by @xmath96 and @xmath95",
    ", we can calculate the cusp lines .",
    "the surface is singular where @xmath97 therefore , the cusps form lines where @xmath96 is zero , @xmath98 or @xmath99 , and @xmath95 is arbitrary .",
    "cc &    c +     + @xmath100&@xmath101 + & + &    c +     + @xmath102&@xmath103 +    in fig .",
    "[ ffig0 ] , we show the image of a set of concentric circles of radius @xmath104 in the @xmath105-plane . by rescaling space and target space",
    "coordinates , the value of @xmath88 can be changed . for convenience , we set @xmath106 in the figure . for small radius , @xmath104 ,",
    "the @xmath107 term is dominant and the image of the circle is a deformed circle . as the radius increases ,",
    "the circle becomes more and more deformed .",
    "the @xmath108 circle maps to the singular curve .",
    "this curve has three spikes .",
    "the points of these spikes are the cusps and running between them are three folds . above this value of @xmath104 ,",
    "the map folds back on itself .",
    "the points inside the fold have four preimages : a @xmath109 preimage with negative jacobian and three @xmath110 preimages with positive jacobians .",
    "eventually , the image circle passes completely through the folding region : for @xmath111 the image is a trefoil shape .",
    "every point outside the fold has just two preimages , each with positive jacobian .",
    "in general , the map @xmath112 for @xmath113 has an unstable singularity on the @xmath95-axis .",
    "this unstable singularity can be removed by adding an anti - holomorphic perturbation .",
    "the perturbed map @xmath114 has a folding surface at @xmath115 .",
    "there are @xmath116 cusps which are located at @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",
    "this map possesses a natural @xmath119-symmetry , which maps the cusps into each other .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath120 is a stable singularity within the set of holomorphic functions , whereas @xmath121 for @xmath122 is unstable even as a holomorphic map .",
    "therefore , we do not expect the latter singularities to occur for a generic holomorphic map .",
    "let us also consider the singularities of the rational map ansatz at the origin .",
    "locally , the shape function can be written as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is an arbitrary positive constant and @xmath125 for @xmath126 this exponent is equal to one .",
    "this means that the jacobian has full rank at the origin .",
    "however , for @xmath127 the exponent @xmath128 is greater than one . in this case",
    "the jacobian of the rational map ansatz has rank zero .",
    "moreover , the derivative @xmath129 vanishes for certain values of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , lines of degenerate singularities with rank one jacobian matrices meet at the origin . here",
    "they form an even more degenerate singularity with a rank zero jacobian matrix . in sect .",
    "[ tetrahedron ] , we argue that for @xmath47 there is a more likely singularity configuration close to the origin .",
    "the rational map ansatz restricts the ansatz fields in three different ways .",
    "it requires that concentric two - spheres around the origin in space are mapped to two - spheres in su@xmath0 .",
    "it also requires that this map is the same for all concentric two - spheres , and it requires that the map between two - spheres is a holomorphic map .",
    "our intention here is to relax the third of these conditions .",
    "we will consider a larger class of maps .",
    "the maps we will consider will be rational maps in the sense that they will have the form of a ratio between polynomials . however , the polynomials will depend on @xmath130 as well as @xmath18 , so they will not be holomorphic maps .    to begin with ,",
    "we consider the ansatz @xmath131 where , as before , @xmath132 but , without assuming @xmath22 is holomorphic , @xmath133 in order to derive the energy , @xmath37 , we calculate the eigenvalues @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the strain tensor ( [ straintensor ] ) .",
    "the strain tensor can be written as @xmath134 where @xmath135 and has eigenvalues @xmath136 notice that @xmath137 and @xmath138 are only equal if @xmath139 , or @xmath140 . in the first case ,",
    "the energy of the holomorphic rational map ansatz ( [ erational ] ) is reproduced .",
    "the second case corresponds to a purely anti - holomorphic ansatz and is just the holomorphic ansatz composed with a reflection .",
    "using equation ( [ egeo ] ) the energy @xmath37 can be rewritten as @xmath141 where @xmath45 and @xmath142 are given by : @xmath143 and @xmath144 as in the holomorphic ansatz , @xmath45 is essentially the integral of the square of the jacobian .",
    "however , @xmath142 is not the integral of the jacobian of @xmath22 .",
    "there is a close relationship between this energy functional and the baby skyrme model on a two - sphere .",
    "the baby skyrme model @xcite is a sigma - model in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions with a fourth order skyrme - like interaction .",
    "the baby - skyrme model on the two - sphere is of independent interest , primarily because there is a phase transition as the radius of the sphere is changed @xcite .    on a unit two - sphere ,",
    "the baby skyrme fields map @xmath145 to @xmath145 and the energy functional is of the form @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are coupling constants .",
    "@xmath142 is the sigma - model energy and @xmath45 is the skyrme energy . for a given shape function , @xmath24 ,",
    "the energy @xmath37 in ( [ eanti ] ) is of this form with @xmath147 and @xmath148 calculated by integrating the shape function over @xmath25 .",
    "obviously , it would be possible to regard the holomorphic maps between two - spheres as anstze for baby - skyrme fields .",
    "for a holomorphic map , @xmath142 is equal to the topological degree .",
    "thus , the holomorphic map which minimizes @xmath45 gives the best approximation to the energy minimizing baby - skyrme field .",
    "in other words , to find the baby - skyrme energy minimizing holomorphic map , the values of @xmath147 and @xmath148 need not be known .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the original rational map ansatz is so convenient to use : the rational map is found first and the shape function is then determined numerically .    for more general maps we need to employ an iterative algorithm .",
    "firstly , using the @xmath45 minimizing holomorphic rational map , a shape function can be calculated numerically .",
    "this gives provisional values for the coupling constants @xmath147 and @xmath148 . the next step is to minimize the baby - skyrme energy with these values of @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "this determines a new map between the riemann spheres .",
    "the original shape function is not optimized for this new map , so a new shape function must be calculated .",
    "a new profile function gives new coupling constants and so the whole procedure has to be iterated .",
    "in practice , this procedure is simplified by the fact that we only consider one - parameter families of non - holomorphic rational maps .    another major advantage of using holomorphic maps is that there is only a finite - dimensional family of holomorphic maps of given topological degree .",
    "in contrast , the space of general maps between two - spheres of a given degree is infinite dimensional .",
    "one way to avoid this problem would be to minimize the baby - skyrme model numerically . however , our interest here is in the folding behavior of minimum energy skyrmions and so we would prefer to find an approximate analytic solution whose folding behavior we can analyze .",
    "for this reason , we will restrict our attention to maps of the form @xmath149 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are polynomials in both @xmath18 and @xmath130 .",
    "we will call the polynomial degree of this map @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the maximal holomorphic degree of the polynomials @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath152 is their maximal anti - holomorphic degree . by counting the number of preimages of a given value of @xmath22 and taking into account the sign of the jacobian at each preimage",
    ", it follows that a general map of this form has topological degree @xmath153 .",
    "some maps will have a different degree because @xmath33 and @xmath34 may have a common factor .",
    "maps of this type are called spurious .    according to formula ( [ bgeo ] ) ,",
    "the baryon number is @xmath154 @xmath6 is no longer an integral over squares , as it was for the holomorphic rational map ansatz .",
    "it is possible that the baryon density could be locally negative .",
    "we will find that this is what happens for certain values of @xmath6 .",
    "the skyrmions that we are interested in are symmetrical : the 3-skyrmion is tetrahedrally symmetric and the @xmath155 is octahedrally symmetric @xcite . rather than minimizing the ansatz energy over the whole space of maps , we restrict our attention to maps that have the same symmetry as the numerically determined minimum energy solution .",

    "choosing @xmath151 and @xmath152 corresponds to a truncation of the possible maps between riemann spheres .",
