    "since the discovery of the morphology - environment relation @xcite , it has been known that galaxy properties are correlated with their large - scale environment : the average morphology , color and luminosity of galaxies differ depending on how crowded their neighborhood is . on the face of it , it is not clear why or how the environment of a galaxy on mpc scales should be related to the kpc - scale processes ( star formation , supernova and agn feedback ) that determine the bulk properties of a galaxy . to further confuse matters , the strong correlation between morphology , color and luminosity ( *",
    "* and references therein ) makes it unclear which property is ultimately driven by environment let alone which physical processes are responsible .",
    "it is not even clear to what extent the environment of a galaxy effects it through nature ( different formation conditions ) rather than nurture ( galaxy - galaxy interactions ) .",
    "a critical step towards answering such questions is to compare observed trends to those present in a simulated galaxy ensemble in which one knows all the processes at work .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a powerful tool for addressing questions of environmental effects .",
    "its spectroscopic sample of galaxies is the largest such sample ever , ensuring that even relatively rare galaxy populations are well represented , and the survey s large contiguous footprint makes it easy to determine the large - scale environment for most of these galaxies .",
    "previous researchers who have used the sdss galaxy catalog to study environmental dependences have found three broad trends : the peaks of the bimodal color distribution of galaxies do not shift for different environments ; blue and red galaxies are most common in low- and high - density environments , respectively ; the luminosity of red galaxies increases with local density @xcite .",
    "the millennium simulation ( ms , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the largest ever cosmological simulation comprising some @xmath0 dark matter ( dm ) particles with a spatial resolution of @xmath1 kpc . at @xmath2 ,",
    "the simulation fills a cube @xmath3 mpc per side .",
    "the ms does not explicitly model the gas , dust and stars which make up observable galaxies , but it produces a dm halo merger tree which serves as the backbone for a number of semi - analytic models ( sams ) . unlike n - body / sph simulations , sams do not simulate the gravitational and hydrodynamic forces involved in the formation and evolution of galaxies , but they do provide a computationally inexpensive way to explore the parameter space of sub - grid processes .",
    "the trade - off is that the parameters of a sam must be tuned using observations ( e.g. matching to the observed luminosity function ) , making truly independent comparisons between the model and reality more challenging .",
    "numerous groups have developed sams which hierarchically form some @xmath4 galaxies from the ms merger tree ( eg : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "their models differ for example in their treatment of agn feedback but all reproduce some of the empirical features of galaxy populations .",
    "the ms galaxies have a very realistic distribution of luminosities , thanks to judicious use of `` radio '' feedback .",
    "they also exhibit a bimodal color distribution as discovered in sdss @xcite . finally , the power spectrum of the density fluctuations is in good agreement with the empirical data from 2df and sdss @xcite .",
    "previous investigators have found that the brightest ms galaxies are red , dead ellipticals populating rich galaxy clusters @xcite , while the modeled galaxies in the very lowest - density environments have similar colors and star formation rates as analogous sdss galaxies @xcite .    in this work",
    "we compare the observed galaxy populations with those produced with sams .",
    "our work differs from those listed above in the following ways : we use bayesian number density as a proxy for local environment , rather than the commonly used surface density or two - point correlation function ; we use the @xmath5 color , which has more leverage than the @xmath6 color ; we use sdss data release 5 , rather than any of the previous ( smaller ) releases ; and last but not least , we compare observed and modeled galaxies for the full range of galaxy environments and colors .",
    "we use a sample of 674,749 galaxies from the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) main galaxy sample , an optical imaging and spectroscopic survey of galaxies over 1/4 of the sky ( with limiting magnitude @xmath7 after foreground extinction removal ) .",
    "we create a complete volume and luminosity - limited sample with @xmath8 ( or distances of 43345  mpc from the milky way ) and @xmath9 , leaving 90,689 galaxies .",
    "the characteristic galaxy luminosity in the sdss r - band is @xmath10 @xcite , which falls well within our magnitude limit .",
    "we use model magnitudes corrected for foreground extinction but do not apply k corrections ( we instead apply k corrections to the model galaxies ) ; absolute magnitudes are computed using @xmath11 @xcite . as our sample of sdss galaxies only extends to lookback times less than 1  gyrs , it is representative of local galaxies .",
    "we use the modeled galaxies generated by @xcite and available online through the millennium simulation database .",
    "the quantities we use are the cartesian positions and velocities of the galaxies , as well as their absolute sdss @xmath12 and @xmath13 magnitudes , which include dust extinction from both a diffuse ism and attenuation of stars in young clusters in the emitting galaxy @xcite .",
    "we make a @xmath9 cut on the @xmath2 snapshot , resulting in a complete sample of 1,805,780 galaxies in the simulation volume . we create a mock observational catalog for an observer at the origin by computing the right ascension , declination and distance modulus of each galaxy .",
    "since the model galaxies have rest - frame colors , we apply k corrections using the model spectra of @xcite , although this changes the colors by less than @xmath14 magnitudes .",
    "we then make cuts on radial distance , keeping only those galaxies which fall within the 43345  mpc range of our volume - limited sdss sample .",
    "this mock `` survey '' covers one eighth of the sky and contains 110,437 galaxies , @xmath15% more than our sdss sample .",
    "the most common proxy for environment is the number density of galaxies , or the surface density of galaxies within redshift slices .",
    "for example , @xcite use a deprojected angular correlation function , while @xcite use an adaptively smoothed surface - density .",
    "other groups have used three - dimensional density estimators , such as over - density on a @xmath16 mpc scale @xcite or within a smoothing kernel @xcite .",
    "@xcite use a hybrid of three - dimensional and two - dimensional 10th nearest neighbor density , noting that the former tends to under - estimate density in high - mass galaxy clusters .",
    "it is also common practice to use the three - dimensional galaxy correlation function as a metric for density ( eg : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it should be noted that the two - point correlation function is insensitive to higher order correlations which almost certainly exist between galaxies .",
    "we compute densities using three - dimensional positions .",
    "rather than use the traditional tenth nearest neighbor metric for number density , @xmath17 , we use a bayesian metric @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 if computing the density at the location of a galaxy .",
    "the constant @xmath20 is empirically determined by demanding that @xmath21 matches actual number density when density is estimated on a regular grid for a uniform density field . as shown in @xcite , the use of distances to all ten neighbors , as opposed to only the tenth neighbor , results in a factor of @xmath22 improvement in the precision of density estimates .",
    "although we are mostly interested in the density at the position of galaxies , the bayesian density estimator can be used at arbitrary positions , allowing us to construct a density map on a regular grid . in fig .",
    "[ sloan_great_wall ] we show the density map ( with resolution 1 mpc ) for an equatorial slice of dr5 , centered on the sloan great wall of @xcite .",
    "thanks to the precision of our density estimator , it is easily discernible that the `` wall '' is not a monolithic structure , but results from the juxtaposition of a collection of large clusters of galaxies this structure is more reminiscent of a mountain range than a great wall . ] .",
    "three observational effects which plague the sdss galaxy sample could significantly affect the density distribution of galaxies : incompleteness , edge effects , and `` fingers of god '' . in this section",
    "we describe these effects and quantify how they influence the density distribution of sdss galaxies .    for galaxies falling within 55  of each other",
    ", only one galaxy gets a fiber , due to fiber collisions . since 30% of the sdss survey area",
    "consists of overlap regions between neighboring fields , the net effect of fiber collisions is a loss of 6% of the photometric galaxies that would otherwise be in the spectrocopic catalogue @xcite .",
    "fiber collisions notwithstanding , more than 95% of galaxies in the sdss photometric catalogue are given a fiber and are in the spectroscopic catalogue .",
    "the bulk of the remaining 5% suffer from blending with saturated stars and do not significantly bias the spectroscopic galaxy sample @xcite .",
    "the tiling of sdss fields is such that there are no gaps except near the edges of the survey area @xcite .",
    "the density estimated near the edge of the dr5 footprint will be artificially low because sdss spectra have not been obtained for many of the true nearest neighbors . to remove the most egregious offenders ,",
    "we do not compute densities for any galaxies with fewer than 10 neighbors within a 10  mpc radius or for galaxies falling within 10  mpc of our redshift limits .",
    "galaxies in the sdss spectroscopic catalog have small redshift uncertainties ( 30 km / sec ) , but the true limiting factor for determining the radial distance to galaxies is the `` fingers of god '' effect : massive galaxy clusters have large velocity dispersion , @xmath23 , which has the effect of smearing them out in redshift - space and reducing their apparent density by a factor @xmath24 .    to quantify the impact of observational effects , we compare the density distribution of our our mock survey of ms galaxies with that for the same survey but in which we model these effects .",
    "fiber collisions are conservatively implemented by ignoring all neighbors within 55  of a galaxy when computing density ( this affects 6% of the galaxies , in good agreement with the estimate for sdss fiber collisions ) .",
    "general spectroscopic incompleteness is implemented by removing 5% of the galaxies at random from the catalogue . to increase the surface area to volume ratio and hence the importance of edge effects",
    "we limit our samples to galaxies lying _ less than _ 10  mpc from a survey edge ( reducing the size of the sample by a factor @xmath25 ) .",
    "we model fingers of god by adding the peculiar velocity of each galaxy ( obtained from the ms database ) to its model hubble flow , then computing its apparent radial distance from this mock redshift rather than from its actual cartesian position .",
    "the density distributions for the mock ms survey with and without observational effects are shown as solid and dotted lines in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ uber_density_function ] .",
    "the distribution remains unaffected except at high densities , where fingers of god completely erase the high density tail ( @xmath26% of galaxies ) .",
    "if this extremely high density population of galaxies exists , it will only be detected in the next generation surveys operating at higher redshifts , where the hubble flow dominates over peculiar velocities .",
    "for the remainder of the paper we compare our sdss galaxy sample to the mock ms survey , including the effects of fiber collisions , spectroscopic incompleteness and fingers of god .",
    "for the purposes of plotting our results , we remove outliers from both galaxy samples by cutting out the top and bottom percentile in color , as well as the top and bottom @xmath27% in luminosity and density .",
    "the ms histograms are rescaled to the same total number of galaxies as for the sdss .",
    "[ uber_density_function ] shows the density distributions for the sdss and ms galaxies , separated into the blue and red mode based on the @xmath28 cut of @xcite ( for comparison , the peak of the density distribution for random positions in the survey is @xmath29  mpc@xmath30 in either galaxy sample ) .",
    "there are @xmath31% too many blue galaxies in the ms as compared to the sdss , despite the fact that the minimum in color for both samples occurs at @xmath28 ( see fig .",

    "red galaxies represent @xmath36 of the highest density quartiles of both the sdss and ms samples .",

    "for the brightest galaxies , however , density correlates with luminosity and not with color .",
    "we have compared two analogous galaxy samples , one from the sdss dr5 spectroscopic sample , and one from the sams of @xcite , after correcting for the observational effects present in the former .",
    "the density distribution and the luminosity function of the modeled galaxies qualitatively match those for the sdss sample , but there are @xmath31% too many blue galaxies in the former . in detail ,",
    "two additional discrepancies become apparent between the galaxy samples : ms galaxies are more blue in @xmath5 than sdss galaxies ; the colors of galaxies depend more strongly on environment in ms than in sdss .",
