    "the internal structures within dark matter halos have important impact on galaxies and clusters formed within these halos .",
    "this is the reason for recent enormous interest in the innermost density profiles of the dark matter halos . from a set of halo simulations with @xmath5 particles , navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ; nfw ) concluded that the density profiles universally obey the nfw form @xmath6 .",
    "it is yet unclear to which degree their results are affected by their selection criterion which is not well - defined , as questioned recently by jing ( 1999 ) . with a higher resolution of @xmath7 particles , fukushige & makino ( 1997 ) and moore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found a steeper inner slope and argued that the slope might converge to a value about @xmath8 .",
    "however , kravtsov et al.(1998 ) , with a resolution in between the above studies as the authors themselves claimed , found a shallower slope than the nfw one .",
    "therefore , a consensus still needs to be reached about the inner density profile of the halos .    motivated by these confusing results and the importance of studying other internal properties of the halos , e.g. substructures , we have selected 15 halos from a cosmological simulation and resimulated each halo with @xmath7 particles .",
    "we emphasize our selection of the halos is random ( cf .",
    "nfw ) , in order to pin down selection effects introduced to the sample , thus in order to unbiasly study the internal properties of the dark matter halos .",
    "we adopt the following two - step procedure .",
    "first we select 15 dark matter halos from our lcdm cosmological n - body simulation ( jing & suto 1998 ) , with five in each category which has a mass scale of clusters , groups , and galaxies respectively .",
    "these halos are resimulated typically with @xmath9 particles , @xmath10 fine particles for the central halo region and its nearby outskirts , and @xmath11 coarse particles for outer region .",
    "about @xmath12 particles end up within the virial radius of each halo , making this sample as the largest sample of million particle halo simulations .",
    "we developed a new algorithm , the nested - grid @xmath13 algorithm , to calculate the force with an accuracy around 0.1 percent .",
    "the force law is softened with the proper softening length about 0.004 the final virial radius .",
    "each simulation has evolved 10,000 time steps by the leap - frog algorithm .",
    "as an important application , we have examined the radial density profiles ( jing & suto 2000 ) which are plotted in figure [ fig : haloprof ] . the inner slope of the profiles , however , is generally steeper than the nfw value , @xmath14 , in agreement with the previous findings of fukushige & makino ( 1997 ) and moore et al .",
    "we have fitted the profiles to @xmath15 with @xmath16 ( the solid lines ) and @xmath17 ( nfw form ; the dotted curves ) for @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the radius within which the spherical overdensity is @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting concentration parameter @xmath21 , defined as the @xmath22 , is plotted in the left panel of figure [ fig : haloslope ] .",
    "this is the most accurate determination of the concentration parameter for the lcdm model .",
    "there exists a significant scatter among @xmath21 for similar mass ( jing , 1999 ) , and a clear systematic dependence on halo mass ( nfw , moore et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "our most important result is that the density profiles of the 4 galactic halos are all well fitted by @xmath16 , but those of the cluster halos are better fitted to the nfw form @xmath17 .",
    "this is in contrast with moore et al.(1999 ) who concluded that both galactic and cluster halos have the inner density profile @xmath23 , despite that they considered one cluster - mass halo alone .",
    "in fact , our current samples can address this question in a more statistical manner .",
    "cl1 has significant substructures , and the other three are nearly in equilibrium .",
    "interestingly the density profiles of cl2 and cl3 are better fitted to the nfw form , and that of cl4 is in between the two forms .",
    "the density profiles of the group halos are in between the galactic and cluster halos , as expected .",
    "one is better fitted to the nfw form , whereas the other three follow the @xmath16 form .",
    "we have presented the first study which simulates fifteen dark halos with about a million particles .",
    "this enables us to address the profile of the halos with unprecedented accuracy and statistical reliability . while qualitative aspects of our results are not inconsistent with those reported by moore et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , our larger sample of halos provides convincing evidence that _ the form _ of the density profiles is not universal ; instead it depends on halo mass . since mass and formation epoch",
    "are linked in hierarchical models , the mass dependence may reflect an underlying link to the age of the halo .",
    "older galactic halos more closely follow the @xmath16 form while younger cluster halos have shallower inner density profiles fitted better by the nfw form .",
