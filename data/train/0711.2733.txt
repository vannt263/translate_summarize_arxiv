    "the magnon bandwidth of dymno@xmath0 , in which the inelastic neutron scattering study would be difficult to perform due to the presence of the neutron - absorbing dy ions , should be comparable to , or slightly smaller than , that of tbmno@xmath0 , since dymno@xmath0 is structurally close to tbmno@xmath0 and shows the similar @xmath3 plane cycloidal order at the ground state.@xcite therefore , two - magnon energy range is anticipated to be up to 1015 mev , which well fits the observed energy range of the electric - dipole active spin excitations .    here",
