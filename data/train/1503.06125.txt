    "the decay rates for a finite hypernucleus are obtained from the previous partial widths via the lda : @xmath71 this approximation ( see also appendix [ append - rate ] ) consists in introducing a local nucleon fermi momentum @xmath72 in terms of the density profile @xmath73 of the nuclear core and then in averaging the partial widths over the nuclear volume .",

    "<S> the non  mesonic weak decay of double@xmath0 hypernuclei is studied within a microscopic diagrammatic approach . besides the nucleon  induced mechanism , @xmath1 , widely studied in single@xmath0 hypernuclei , additional hyperon  induced mechanisms , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are accessible in double@xmath0 hypernuclei and are investigated here . as in previous works on single@xmath0 hypernuclei , we adopt a nuclear matter formalism extended to finite nuclei via the local density approximation and a one  meson exchange weak transition potential ( including the ground state pseudoscalar and vector octets mesons ) supplemented by correlated and uncorrelated two  pion  exchange contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the weak decay rates are evaluated for hypernuclei in the region of the experimentally accessible light hypernuclei @xmath5be and @xmath6b . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions are compared with a few previous evaluations . </S>",
    "<S> the rate for the @xmath2 decay is dominated by @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9exchange and turns out to be about 2.5% of the free @xmath0 decay rate , @xmath10 , while the total rate for the @xmath3 and @xmath11 decays , dominated by @xmath12exchange , amounts to about 0.25% of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental measurement of these decays would be essential for the beginning of a systematic study of the non  mesonic decay of strangeness @xmath13 hypernuclei . </S>",
