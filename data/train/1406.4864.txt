    "astrophysical disks play a crucial role in the formation , evolution , and fate of a wide variety of celestial objects , by mediating the transport of mass , energy , and angular momentum .",
    "building realistic disk models is of fundamental importance for understanding , for example , protoplanetary disks around young stars , accretion flows onto stellar compact objects and active galactic nuclei , as well as the interstellar medium in galactic disks .",
    "the large dynamic range involved makes it particularly challenging to produce detailed global numerical simulations of these systems .",
    "moreover , while global models allow us to investigate large - scale phenomena , local models with a hierarchy of increasingly complex microphysics have proved critical to elucidating the processes that are crucial at small scales .",
    "because of this , several types of local approximations have been employed for studying astrophysical disks .",
    "@xcite pioneered the use of a local approximation to study the dynamics of particles orbiting a host system and subject to encounters with a perturber , and used it to study the motion of the moon . @xcite",
    "and @xcite applied these ideas to galactic disks using the concept of a locally shearing coordinate system .",
    "this approach constitutes the basis of the shearing sheet framework which has been widely used to study the dynamics of orbiting particles and planetesimals , as well as local processes in hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic disks .",
    "the implementation of the concept behind the shearing sheet , with an appropriate shear - periodic radial - boundary condition @xcite , forms a computational model used for studying local disk dynamics referred to as the shearing box @xcite .",
    "shearing box models solve the equations of motion for the fluid in a local cartesian frame co - rotating with the disk at a fiducial radius . in the standard framework ,",
    "the differential rotation of the disk is locally accounted for with a height - independent angular frequency .",
    "this is appropriate for disks with a barotropic equilibrium for which the pressure is only a function of density and thus rotate on cylinders .",
    "the shearing box framework relies on a first order expansion of the steady bulk flow in the radial direction , which is the highest order compatible with shearing periodic boundary conditions . depending on whether zeroth or first order expansions",
    "are considered for the gravitational field in the direction perpendicular to the disk , usually denoted with the coordinate @xmath0 , this leads to the so called unstratified @xcite or stratified @xcite shearing box models .",
    "this stratified , compressible shearing box is what we will refer to in this paper as the standard shearing box ( ssb ) .",
    "these approximations are appropriate when the disk is thin and the vertical scales of interest are small compared to the fiducial disk radius .",
    "there have been works that retained the correct expression for the vertical component of the gravitational field @xcite , allowing for larger vertical domains to be considered .",
    "however , this generalization does not allow to study of disks with baroclinic equilibria without relaxing the assumption that the angular frequency is height - independent .",
    "in the early formulation of the shearing sheet , @xcite avoided making any approximation in height ( @xmath0 ) , which is possible when considering barotropic equilibrium structures .",
    "astrophysical disks with baroclinic equilibrium structure , for which the pressure is not solely a function of density , posses angular frequency profiles that depend in general on height , especially if these are not thin . therefore , building a framework to study these disks demands going beyond the ssb , where the assumption that the angular frequency is height - independent is rooted deep . in this work ,",
    "we generalize the ssb by considering the full height - dependence of a steady state , axisymmetric bulk flow to leading order in radius , without making any expansion in the vertical coordinate .",
    "we show that given a global disk model , it is possible to develop approximate models that are local in horizontal planes and global in height and are amenable to shearing - periodic boundary conditions",
    ". these models can be non - axisymmetric for disks with a barotropic global equilibrium but should be axisymmetric for disks with a baroclinic global equilibrium .",
    "we term the resulting framework the vertically global shearing box ( vgsb ) .",
    "the terminology of ` vertically global ' specifically and solely refers to the approach of never making a expansion in the vertical direction in the derivation .",
    "this yields a model which allows us to account for the vertical variation of gravity without approximations and the possible presence of vertical shear .",
    "as we discuss below , the radial expansions that are needed to apply height - dependent shearing periodic boundary conditions do limit the range of vertical scales which can be modeled approximately . in spite of its limitations ,",
    "the vgsb formalism provides a novel framework that goes beyond the ssb and promises to provide a bridge between strictly local and fully global approaches to model astrophysical disks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we derive the equations involved in the vgsb framework in section  [ sec_derivation ] , providing some of the algebraic details in appendix [ sec_velocitysplitting ] .",
    "we state the final form of the vgsb equations and discuss its novel features in section  [ sec_final_eqs ] . for convenience ,",
    "we provide a self - contained summary of the vgsb equations that can be incorporated in magnetohydrodynamic codes in appendix [ sec_vgsbsummary ] .",
    "we use this new framework to explore the behavior of two important instabilities in a baroclinic context .",
    "we demonstrate that a linear vertical shear instability ( vsi ) , akin to those studied by @xcite and @xcite , appears in the vgsb in section  [ sec_vsi ] .",
    "we examine some basic aspects of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in the vgsb in section  [ sec_mri ] .",
    "we conclude by briefly discussing the limitations and several potential applications of the vgsb in section  [ sec_discussion ] .",
    "in addition , in appendix  [ sec : neglecting_curvature ] we outline some details related to neglecting curvature terms , in appendix  [ sec : nondimensional_hydro_momentum ] we analyze the hydrodynamic momentum equation in order to assess under what conditions it is acceptable to discard radial pressure gradients in the ssb and vgsb , and in appendix  [ sec : potvort ] we discuss issues related to potential vorticity in shearing boxes .",
    "we are concerned with the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics , in cylindrical coordinates @xmath1 , in a reference frame rotating with angular frequency @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the mass density , @xmath5 is the fluid velocity in the rotating frame , @xmath6 is the magnetic field , with @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the internal energy density , @xmath9 is the pressure determined through an equation of state , and @xmath10 is the gravitational potential , which is assumed to be cylindrically symmetric , but not necessarily spherical .",
    "the current density is @xmath11 , with @xmath12 a constant dependent on the unit system adopted .",
    "fluid flows described by these equations are subject to conservation laws .",
    "it is thus important to understand under what circumstances these properties are satisfied by the equations describing the local dynamics involving expansions of the original set of equations .",
    "it is easy to show that the approximations embodied in the standard isothermal shearing box are such that the vortex lines of an inviscid flow are frozen into the fluid ( kelvin s circulation theorem ) and that the magnetic flux is also frozen into the fluid in the absence of magnetic dissipation ( alfvn s frozen - in theorem ) .",
    "understanding under what conditions these properties also hold for the equations of motion that result from invoking a local approximation of global disk models which have a baroclinic equilibrium structure is more subtle . here , we state the general versions of the aforementioned theorems in order to prepare the ground to address these issues in subsequent sections .",
    "these conservation theorems can be derived by calculating the lagrangian derivative of the fluxes associated with the vorticity and the magnetic field .",

    "this follows from equation  ( [ eq : flux_advection ] ) with @xmath31 and the induction equation ( [ eq_induc ] ) .",
    "we seek to derive a set of equations that describe the local dynamics of the magnetized fluid with respect to a known steady state bulk flow around a point co - rotating with the disk at a distance @xmath32 . here , we outline the steps of the derivation , which is carried out in detail below .    1 .   we find a suitable steady flow and background equilibrium , which enables the derivation of exact equations of motion for the departures from this solution .",
    "we transform to a locally cartesian coordinate system .",
    "we expand the bulk flow and background equilibrium to leading order in the radial direction leaving the direction perpendicular to the disk midplane unaltered .",
    "we determine under which circumstances the resulting equations are amenable to being solved with shearing - periodic boundary conditions , which could depend on height for disk models with baroclinic global equilibria .",
    "we show explicitly these steps for the momentum and induction equations , while we state the results for the continuity equation and energy equation that are simpler to work with .            as in the ssb ,",

    "these models can be non - axisymmetric for disks with globally barotropic equilibria but should be axisymmetric for disks with globally baroclinic equilibria . under either of these conditions ,",

    "some of these limitations are also characteristic of the ssb , while others are inherent to the vgsb .    it should be clear that the vgsb , as well as the ssb , framework consists of a set of dynamical equations for the perturbations with respect to a time - independent background representing a smaller section of a steady global disk model . in this approach , by construction , the fluctuations can not modify the dynamics of the background .",
    "this could be considered a serious limitation , however , this kind of approach as embodied in the ssb has proven exceptionally useful as a workhorse to understand a wide variety of phenomena in disks . another limitation of the vgsb , that is shared by the ssb , is that the local approximation in radius prevents the full consideration curvature terms , which are inherent to the cylindrical geometry usually employed to model disks ( see appendix  [ sec : neglecting_curvature ] ) .",
    "the set of equations that define the ssb can be obtained by expanding in radius and height either the gravitational potential of a point source or the keplerian background flow that ensues when radial pressure support can be neglected . in order to derive the equations defining the vgsb we have approximated the background flow itself .",
    "the body and frame forces which appear in this formulation relate to a fluid element in that flow with the given global thermodynamics , not the forces on a test particle .",
    "thus , these forces are not the same as an expansion of the tidal potential about a keplerian orbit . in the special case of a barotropic global equilibrium",
    ", the body forces do correspond to a conservative potential , but in general for baroclinic backgrounds this is not the case .",
    "the advantage of expanding the angular frequency is that its equilibrium profile @xmath264 is sensitive to the equilibrium pressure gradient , enabling access to rotation laws beyond strictly keplerian , in particular those with vertical shear .",
    "the most important limitations of the vgsb stem from the fact that we have opted to explore the consequences of imposing height - dependent shearing - periodic boundary conditions ( see section  [ sec_compatibility ] ) . in order to do this , we had to approximate equation  ( [ eq_wraping ] ) and use equation  ( [ eq_wraping_approx ] ) instead . whereas this seems a reasonable approximation",
    ", it had in general undesired consequences for some basic conservation laws such as kelvin s circulation theorem and alfvn s frozen - in theorem unless axisymmetry is imposed . in order to consider height - dependent shearing - periodic boundary conditions we also needed to understand under what circumstances it was acceptable to neglect background pressure gradients . even though the vgsb can be considered to be global in height",
    "because there is no need to expand the background in the @xmath0-direction , the analysis we carried out of the pressure gradients in appendix  [ sec : nondimensional_hydro_momentum ] shows that it is necessary to limit the vertical extent of the domain to @xmath265 .",
    "this is more restrictive than @xmath266 , but nevertheless can accommodate for many scale - heights with the added value of being able to account for the full expression of the vertical gravity and vertical shear within the domain .",
    "the derivation of the vgsb formalism has allowed us to shed light into several subtle issues that are usually not addressed in the context of the ssb , see e.g. , appendices  [ sec : nondimensional_hydro_momentum ] and [ sec : potvort ] . in spite of its limitations , the ssb has proven to be a useful tool to learn about local disk dynamics .",
    "we believe that the vgsb will allow the relaxation of some of the assumptions that have been widely adopted by using the ssb .",
