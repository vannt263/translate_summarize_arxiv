    "supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( sm ) is one of candidates for tev - scale physics , because supersymmetry ( susy ) can stabilize a large hierarchy .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is quite interesting because of its minimality , and various phenomenological aspects have been studied .",
    "however , from theoretical point of view , it has a problem .",
    "the mssm includes supersymmetric mass terms of higgs superfields , @xmath1 and @xmath2 i.e. the so - called @xmath3-term , @xmath4 , in the superpotential .",
    "it must be comparable with soft susy breaking masses in order to realize successfully the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the @xmath3-term and soft susy breaking terms , in general , have origins different from each other .",
    "why are these comparable with each other ? that is the so - called @xmath3-problem  @xcite .",
    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) is an extension of the mssm by adding a singlet superfield @xmath5  @xcite ( see for a review ref .",
    "then , the nmssm superpotential has @xmath6 . also , we impose the @xmath0 symmetry , which forbids dimensionful parameters in the superpotential .",
    "dimensionful parameters appear only as soft susy breaking parameters .",
    "thus , vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of higgs and singlet fields are determined by soft susy breaking terms .",
    "that is , the @xmath3-problem is solved , and the effective @xmath3-term is generated as @xmath7 .    in the nmssm ,",
    "the higgs sector as well as the neutralino sector has a richer structure than one in the mssm , because of inclusion of the singlet superfield @xmath5 .",
    "also , the nmssm can raise the sm - like higgs boson mass . at any rate ,",
    "heavier superpartner masses such as @xmath8 tev may be favorable .",
    "we may need fine - tuning to realize a little hierarchy between the electorweak scale and susy breaking scale .",
    "however , such a fine - tuning can be improved in a certain mediation mechanism , e.g. in the tev - scale mirage mediation scenario @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry is important to forbid dimensionful parameters in the superpotential and to solve the @xmath3-problem .",
    "however , it is problematic .",
    "vevs of the higgs scalar and singlet break spontaneously the @xmath0 symmetry . in general , when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken",
    ", domain walls appear .",
    "they would dominate the energy density of the universe and change the standard cosmology drastically .",
    "thus , the exact @xmath0 symmetry and the stable domain walls are problematic @xcite .",
    "see for the nmssm @xcite .    here",
    ", we assume that the @xmath0 symmetry is broken explicitly , but its breaking size is much smaller than the electroweak scale .",
    "then , the domain walls are unstable",
    ". they may dominate the energy density of the universe at a certain period but decay .",
    "it has important effects on thermal history .",
    "( see e.g. ref  @xcite . ) in this paper , we study implications of unstable domain walls in the nmssm . in general ,",
    "susy models have other problems due to moduli , gravitino and the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) .",
    "for example , in the gravity mediation scenario , moduli and gravitino masses would be comparable with masses of superpartners in the visible sector . when those are of @xmath8 tev , they affect successful big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , that is , the so - called moduli - problem and gravitino problem",
    ". they could be diluted by decay of domain walls  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even if the moduli and gravitino are heavier than superpartners in the visible sector , that would lead to another problem . indeed , in the mirage mediation mechanism  @xcite , the gravitino is heavier by @xmath9 than superpartners in the visible sector , and the modulus is also heavier by @xmath9 than the gravitino .",
    "in such a case , the moduli decay into the gravitino with a large rate and the gravitino decays into the lsp .",
    "this overproduces non - thermally the lsp  @xcite .",
    "we need to dilute the moduli , gravitino and the lsp .",
    "also , in some other scenarios , the lsp such bino - like neutralino has a large thermal relic density  .",
    "the decay of domain walls , which was mentioned above , can produce a large entropy and dilute moduli and dark matter candidates in the nmssm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we study the domain wall solution in the nmssm . in section 3 ,",
    "we study cosmological evolution of unstable domain walls . in sections 4 and 5 , we study implications of the domain wall decay in two scenarios .",
    "section 6 is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "we briefly review a domain wall solution of the higgs potential in the @xmath0 symmetric nmssm .",
    "we adopt the convention for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 that the superfield and its lowest component are written by the same letter .",
    "the superpotential terms including only @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 are written as @xmath10 where the @xmath0 symmetry is imposed as mentioned .",
    "the scalar potential is written by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the d - term potential due to @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the soft susy breaking terms , @xmath15 only the neutral components develop their vevs , and their scalar potential is written explicitly by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the @xmath19 and @xmath20 gauge couplings , respectively . here",
    ", we assume that all of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are real .",
    "the potential minima are obtained by analyzing the stationary conditions , @xmath25 and these vevs lead to the successful electroweak symmetry breaking , where the effective @xmath3 term is obtained as @xmath26 .",
    "since the scalar potential has the @xmath0 symmetry , three vacua are degenerate , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , where all @xmath29 and @xmath30 are real with @xmath31 gev .",
    "one of three degenerate vacua is selected in the vacuum , and then the @xmath0 symmetry is broken spontaneously .",
    "then , the domain walls are generated .",
    "first , we study the domain wall solution  @xcite .",
    "we fix field values of radial directions of @xmath32 and @xmath2 , and discuss a field equation for the phase degree of freedom @xmath33 , @xmath34 the potential of @xmath33 can be obtained from @xmath35 as @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes @xmath33-independent terms",
    ". the first term would be dominant when @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "also , the kinetic term of @xmath33 is written by @xmath41 with @xmath42 .    for simplicity ,",
    "we consider a planar domain wall orthogonal to the @xmath43-axis , @xmath44 .",
    "then , the field equation , @xmath45 can be written by @xmath46 with @xmath47 the first term in the numerator of the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ def : b ] ) is dominant when @xmath48 .",
    "we set the boundary condition such that @xmath49 at @xmath50 and @xmath51 at @xmath52 with @xmath53 . by solving the above field equation with this boundary condition ,",
    "the domain wall solution is derived as @xmath54 where @xmath55 corresponds to the width of the domain wall .",
    "figure 1 shows this solution for @xmath56 .",
    "now , we can estimate the domain wall tension @xmath57 thus , we can estimate @xmath58 for @xmath48 .",
    "the size of @xmath3 is of the susy breaking scale .",
    "is much larger than the elwctroweak scale , we have the fine - tuning problem to derive the z - boson mass @xmath59 from @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "however , in a certain mediation such as the tev - scale mirage mediation contributions due to @xmath3 and @xmath62 cancel each other in @xmath59 , and @xmath59 is independent of @xmath3 . without severe fine - tuning @xmath3",
    "can be larger than the electroweak scale , e.g. @xmath63tev  @xcite . ]",
    "the couplings @xmath21 and @xmath22 must be of @xmath64 or less at the electorweak scale such that they do not blow up below a high energy scale such as the gut or planck scale . thus , the size of @xmath65 would be of the susy breaking scale or larger .",
    "figure 2 shows an example of @xmath66 .",
    "+      formed domain walls are stretched by the cosmic expansion and smoothed by interactions with particles in the background thermal plasma .",
    "the energy density of domain walls @xmath67 and its pressure @xmath68 can be read from the averaged energy momentum tensor of domain walls .",
    "the equation of state of domain walls is given by @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the averaged velocity of walls  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics depends on @xmath70 .",
    "in one extremal limit , non - relativistic limit or static limit with @xmath71 , the energy density behaves @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the scale factor of the universe . such domain wall network is sometime referred to as `` frustrated domain wall '' .",
    "such a frustrated domain wall dominated universe causes acceralating expansion because of @xmath74 . on the other hand , for @xmath75 where @xmath76 is realized",
    ", the cosmic expansion is not acceralating .",
    "in fact , the dynamics of domain walls has been investiagted and many detailed numerical simulations show that the dynamics of domain wall network is relaxed at a late time to so - called scaling regime , where the typical length scale @xmath77 of the system stays of the hubble radius @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "then , the energy density of domain walls also scales as  @xcite @xmath79 the energy density of domain wall decreases slower than any other `` matter '' or radiation in the scaling solution  , it is furtehr slower . ] .",
    "thus , at some point , the energy density of domain walls dominates that in the universe .",
    "this is the domain wall problem  @xcite .",
    "thus , the stable domain wall in the @xmath0 symmetric nmssm is problematic  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider a tiny but explicit breaking of the @xmath0 discrete symmetry so that domain walls might have a long life time but finally decay .",
    "in fact , the decay of domain walls after domain wall domination has an interesting cosmological implication , namely the dilution of unwanted relics by late time entropy production  @xcite .",
    "few numerical detailed study on dymanics of the domain walls network in a domain wall dominated universe has been done .",
    "hence , the domain wall dynamics in a domain wall dominated universe after its scaling behavior is uncertain .",
    "one likely possibility is that the scale of the system remains of the order of the hubble radius as in the scaling regime after domain wall domination too .",
    "this can be realized for the equation of the state @xmath80 .",
    "thus , in the most of the following analysis , we assume this . on the other hand",
    ", there is another possibility that the dynamics after the domination would be frozen as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are realized as in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "we briefly discuss results for this latter case too .    before closing this subsection , here we briefly note some examples of the @xmath0 symmetry breaking in the literature for information . in ref .",
    "@xcite , panagiotakopoulos and tamvakis proposed adding extra symmetries which consistently allows to induce a tiny enough tad pole term @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a soft susy breaking mass and @xmath85 is a power of loop inducing this term , in the scalar potential and the degeneracy of vacua is resolved .",
    "hamaguchi et al proposed another solution by intorducing hidden qcd theory , where the @xmath0 symmetry becomes anomalous and is broekn by quantum effects  @xcite .",
    "in such a minor extension of @xmath0 symmetric nmssm , the domain walls become unstable .",
    "since the size of the @xmath0 breaking term is highly model dependent and the main purpose of this paper is to study cosmological effects of late time domain walls decay , the decay rate of a domain wall @xmath86 , which also parameterise the size of the @xmath0 symmetry breaking , is treated as a free parameter . throughout this paper , in order to connect successful bbn , we take the domain wall decay temperature @xmath87 of a few mev .",
    "we note that the lower bound of the rehearting temperature by late decay objects is about a few mev  @xcite .",
    "when doublet and/or singlet higgs fields develop the vevs , domain walls are formed . as mentioned above , after certain dynamics , the domain wall network would be relaxed to be in the scaling solution . in the scaling regime ,",
    "the energy density of domain walls is given by @xmath88      the first case we consider is that , at the domain wall formation time @xmath89 , the universe is dominated by the energy density of a matter @xmath90 such as a long - lived coherent oscillating moduli field . in the scaling solution of domain wall ,",
    "the energy density of domain walls relative to that of the background increases and eventually dominates the universe .",
    "the domain wall energy density becomes equal to one of the matter at @xmath91 , which is estimated with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ehodw : inscaling ] ) as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the reduced planck mass .",

    "after the domain walls decay , the energy density of the matter is diluted as @xmath100 for the case that the domain wall decays earlier than the matter does . here , @xmath101 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "next , we discuss the case that domain walls are formed in radiation - dominated universe .",
    "both energy densities become comparable with each other at @xmath102 since domain walls are in the scaling solution .",
    "the entropy density ratio of after- to before - domain wall decay is given by @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "we can obtain an entropy production @xmath105 one might think that the tension of about @xmath106 tev looks somewhat too large .",
    "however , for instance , in the mssm - like region of the nmssm with @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the domain wall tension @xmath109 can be of such an order with @xmath110 and @xmath111 tev . those results in the effective @xmath3 term and the singlino mass of about @xmath112 tev .",
    "figure 3 shows the entropy density ratio of after- to before- domain wall decay for @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "the ratio increases as @xmath3 and @xmath115 increase .",
    "such a large late - time entropy production can dilute unwanted relics such as gravitino , overproduced lsp as well as axion .",

    "we can obtain an entropy production @xmath122",
    "in this section , we study implications of the nmssm domain wall decay to some relics in several models .",
    "wimps have been regarded as a promising dark matter candidate in our universe . in the nmssm ,",
    "neutralino is the candidate  @xcite . in a right - handed neutrino extended model",
    ", right - handed sneutrino also becomes a wimp dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "since the wimp thermal relic abundance is inversely proportional to its thermal averaged annihilation cross section @xmath123 as @xmath124 too small annihilation cross section leads to overabundant wimps .",
    "the singlino- or bino - like neutralino , or right - handed sneutrino with small couplings is indeed such a case .",
    "the domain wall decay produces extra entropy with the dilution factor ( [ rad : delta1 - 2:scaling2 ] ) and could regulate the wimp relic abundance to be @xmath125 even for a small annihilation cross section @xmath126 pb .",
    "mirage mediation models appear free from the cosmological moduli problem because a moduli mass is quite large .",
    "however , nonthermally produced lsp through a decay chain by way of gravitino are in fact overabundant .",
    "let us examine whether the dmain wall decay dilute those lsps .",
    "moduli decay before the energy density of domain walls dominates the universe , because the moduli decay rate @xmath127 is larger than @xmath128 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - eq : scaling : md ] ) in the mirage mediation scenario . at @xmath129 ,",
    "the moduli decay at a moduli dominated universe produces gravitinos as @xmath130 with the branching ratio of moduli decay into gravitinos @xmath131 @xcite , and the universe becomes radiation dominated . here",

    "( [ rad : delta1 - 2:scaling2 ] ) .",
    "unstable gravitinos decay into lsp with @xmath134 due to r - parity conservation .",
    "usually , this leads to the overproduction of lsp whose abundance exceeds the dark matter abundance .",
    "after extra entropy production by the domain wall decay , the resultant final lsp abundance becomes @xmath135 in other words , @xmath136 in figure 4 , we consider the case that the lsp is the dark matter , and plot @xmath137 by using ( [ def : delta ] ) .",
    "the input parameters are @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "+      finally , we comment on the qcd axion , @xmath140 , with the decay constant @xmath141 .",
    "after the qcd transition , axions are produced by coherent oscillation , so - called misalignment mechanism , and a good candidate for dark matter because its lifetime is much longer than the age of the universe .",
    "its abundance is proportional to @xmath142  @xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath143 is rewritten as @xmath144 @xmath141 , which is larger than ( [ bound : fa ] ) , corresponds to the overproduction of axions .",
    "again , the domain wall decay can dilute the axion abundance for such a larger @xmath141  @xcite .",
    "for example , with the dilution ( [ rad : delta1 - 2:scaling2 ] ) by the domain wall decay , the bound on @xmath141 is relaxed as @xmath145 for @xmath146 tev and @xmath147 mev .",

    ". such stringy axions with larger decay constant can be the qcd axion .",
    "in this section , we study implications of the nmssm domain wall decay with @xmath148 . for the moduli problem within the gravity mediation scenario .",
    "now , let us study the dilution of moduli to avoid the moduli problem .",
    "after inflation , the moduli would start to oscillate and dominate the energy density of the universe .",
    "they may decay during or after the bbn and chage the success of bbn .",
    "to avoid such a situation , the energy density of moduli must satisfy @xmath149 where @xmath150 for 10 tev moduli mass depending on the coupling between the moduli and the gauge field @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath151 in the following analysis .",
