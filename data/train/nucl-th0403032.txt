    "my empirical definition is summarized by the following symbolic equation @xmath26 why are three independent lines of evidence needed ?",
    "the first term , @xmath27 , stands for a class of observables that provide information about its bulk thermodynamic equation of state .",
    "the equation of state characterizes its _ long wavelength _",
    "nonperturbative thermodynamic properties briefly reviewed in section  1 .",
    "the second term , , stands for class of observables that provide direct evidence about its _ short wavelength _",
    "dynamics predicted by perturbative qcd .",
    "the qcd plasma differs qualitative from familiar abelian qed plasmas due to its unique non - abelian color field dynamics .",
    "the radiative energy loss of energetic short wavelength partons was predicted to lead to striking quenching patterns @xcite-@xcite of moderate and high @xmath28 hadrons .",
    "the high rhic cm energy of @xmath29 agev insures that @xmath30 gev jet production rates are large enough to measure via a wide array of inclusive and correlation observables .",
    "these hard partons serve as effective `` external '' tomographic probes of the the qgp and test its -dynamics .",
    "jets play the analogous role of neutrinos that probe the physics of stellar cores , while hadrons play the role of photons that probe the corona of the fireball .    below rhic energies",
    ", the _ * pqcd * _ line of evidence could not be fully developed because the jet rates decrease too rapidly with energy . however , even more importantly , at the lower @xmath31 gev available the effects of initial state nuclear dynamics and the final state hadronic dynamics could not be completely deconvoluted from the final spectra .",
    "this is the key point that i will repeatedly emphasize which differentiates the observables at the sps and rhic energies .",
    "the necessity to test for the same complications at rhic is what gives rise to the third term in eq.([qgpdef ] ) .",
    "the third term , denoted by @xmath32 , stands for control experiments that can clearly differentiate between alternative nuclear dependences specific to _ initial state _",
    "partonic wavefunctions as well as the production mechanisms .",
    "the control differential , @xmath33 , is critical at any energy because the qcd plasma must first be created from pure kinetic energy !",
    "there has been no hot qgp in the universe ( except in cosmic ray collisions ) since the last drop condensed into hadrons about 13 billion years ago .",
    "cold crystalline quark matter may lurk in the cores of neutron stars , but the transient hot qgp must be `` materialized '' in the lab .",
    "the `` matter '' arises from decoherence of _ virtual _ quantum chromo fluctuations in the initial wavefuntions of high energy nuclei .    at ultra - relativistic energies ,",
    "these virtual fluctuations are frozen out due to time dilation into what has been called a color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite .",
    "the cgc is the high density generalization of the bjorken - feynman dilute parton model . at high field strengths , the non - linear interactions of virtual quantum color fluctuations",
    "are predicted to limit the very small bjorken @xmath34 fourier components .",
    "the saturation property of cgc is related to unitarity constraints and determines the maximal entropy that can be produced in @xmath35 at a given @xmath36 as also pointed out by ekrt  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath33 control is needed to characterize to what extent these nonlinear initial state physics effects can be differentiated from effects due to final state interactions in the qgp matter that forms from it . at rhic ,",
    "the best experimental handle on the @xmath33 term happens to be the study of @xmath37 reactions . in such light - heavy ion reactions ,",
    "the initial state cgc physics can be isolated because the produced qgp , if any , is too tenuous .",
    "why do nt i add more terms in eq.([qgpdef ] ) ?",
    "in fact , each term stands for many independent components , as i elaborate below . for the three required terms in eq.(1 ) the published experimental evidence is now overwhelming and conclusive .",
    "four independent experiments have converged to complementary very high quality data sets .",
    "the three terms in eq.(1 ) are necessary and sufficient for establishing that a discovery has been made of a uniquely different form of strongly interacting qgp . after discussing the three lines of evidence ,",
    "i will elaborate on why i believe that direct photons , @xmath38 , hbt , or other interesting observables do not need to be added to eq.(1 ) . those observable provide valuable additional constraints on the _ combined and convoluted _ properties of the initial state , the qgp , _ and _ the dense hadronic matter into which it condenses .",
    "however , the deconvolution of the initial and hadronic final effects has already proven to be very difficult at sps energies and will continue to be at rhic .    to avoid misunderstanding , the discovery of the qgp does not mean that its physical properties are now understood .",
    "in fact , it only signals the beginning of a long and well focused direction of research .",
    "the history of the neutron star discovery offers an instructive analogy . in 1934 baade and zwicky proposed the theoretical existence of neutron stars soon after chadwick discovered free neutrons .",
    "thirty years later in 1967 hewish and bell observed the first few pulsars when suitable radio telescopes could finally be constructed .",
    "an amusing anecdote is that they actually agonized for a time about whether lgm ( little green men ) were sending them encrypted messages from the cosmos .",
    "t.  gold in 1968 ( as @xmath25 did at rhic in 2003 ) put the debate to rest .",
    "gold proposed that radiative energy loss of a magnetized neutron star would cause a predictable spin down .",
    "later precision measurements confirmed this .",
    "seventy years after its proposal , neutron star research still remains a very active experimental and theoretical direction of physics .",
    "current interest has focused on possible _ color field _ super - conductivity  @xcite recently predicted in the very high @xmath39 sector of the qcd phase diagram , beyond the boundaries  @xcite of fig.2b .",
    "the critical @xmath25 control experiments in 2003 could have found that the @xmath40 qgp observables were strongly distorted by the possible initial cgc state that created it .",
    "this would have certainly foiled eq.(1 ) .",
    "the search for the bulk qgp phase of matter would then have had to await higher energies and densities at lhc or for a better understanding of how to deconvolute that initial state physics .",
    "the large positive signatures in similar @xmath41 control experiments at sps showed in fact initial effects strongly distort key observables . at sps",
    "the physics of high @xmath28 cronin enhancement and @xmath42 suppression remain the important open problems . in contrast , at rhic energies , the absence of jet quenching at midrapidity and the `` return of the jeti '' correlations in @xmath43 provided the check - mate completion of eq.(1 ) .",
    "as emphasized by mclerran@xcite in these proceedings , the @xmath25 control at rhic at high rapidities does in fact produce a positive signature for new initial state physics . in those kinematic ranges",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 fails as a null control for qgp , but may signal the onset of nonlinear cgc initial conditions . in this lecture ,",
    "i concentrate on the midrapidity region , @xmath46 , where eq.(1 ) was conclusively satisfied .",
    "the identification of a new form of `` bulk matter '' requires the observation of novel and uniquely different collective properties from ones seen before .",
    "this requirement is the first term in eq.(1 ) . in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the primary observables of bulk collectivity are the radial , azimuthal and longitudinal flow patterns of hundreds or now thousands of produced hadrons .",
    "stocker , greiner , and collaborators were the first to predict @xcite distinctive `` side splash and squeeze - out '' collective flow patterns in nuclear collisions .",
    "the different types of collective flows are conveniently quantified in terms of the first few azimuthal fourier components  @xcite , @xmath48 , of centrality selected triple differential inclusive distribution of hadrons , @xmath49 .",

    "however , the right panel shows that when the local rapidity density per unit area  @xcite drops below the values achieved at rhic @xmath64 , then the elliptic flow ( scaled by the initial spatial ellipticity , @xmath65 ) falls below the perfect fluid hydrodynamic predictions .",
    "we will discuss in more detail the origin of the large discrepancy at sps energies in the next section .    the most impressive feature in fig.([line1fig ] )",
    "is the agreement of the observed hadron mass dependence of the elliptic flow pattern for all hadron species , @xmath66 , with the hydrodynamic predictions below 1 gev / c .",

    "this provides an important test of the overall consistency of the hydrodynamic origin of flow .",
    "the rapidity dependence of the elliptic flow in fig.([line1figb ] ) also shows the long range nature of bulk collectivity .",
    "why is @xmath53 more emphasized than @xmath52 or radial flow as a signature of qgp formation ?",
    "the primary reason is that elliptic flow is generated mainly during the highest density phase of the evolution before the initial geometric spatial asymmetry of the plasma disappears .",
    "it comes from the azimuthal dependence of the pressure gradients , which can be studied by varying the centrality of the events  @xcite .",
    "detailed parton transport  @xcite and hydrodynamic  @xcite calculations show that most of the @xmath53 at rhic is produced before 3 fm / c and that elliptic flow is relatively insensitive to the late stage dissipative expansion of the hadronic phase .",

    "had hadro - chemistry failed at rhic , then a large question mark would have remained about bulk equilibration in the qgp phase .",
    "it is important to point out , that no detailed 3 + 1d hydrodynamic calculation  @xcite-@xcite has yet been able to reproduce the rapid decrease of @xmath81 observed by phobos in fig.([line1figb ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy is due , in my opinion , to the onset of _ hadronic _ dissipation effects as the comoving density decreases with increasing @xmath58 . from the right panel of fig.([line1fig ] ) , we see that as a decrease of the local transverse density from midrapidity rhic conditions leads to an increasing deviation from the perfect fluid limit . the initial density was also observed to decrease at rhic as @xmath82 increases  @xcite . therefore , from sps data alone , we should have expect deviations from the perfect fluid limit away from the midrapidity region .",

    "the subsequent dissipative hadronic fluid is very inefficient in exploiting spatial asymmetry .",
    "a factor of two reduction of the initial qgp density , therefore , leads to a significant systematic bias of the @xmath53 barometer , not only at sps but also at high @xmath82 at rhic .",

    ", the smallness of dissipative corrections in the central regions of rhic is even more surprising . at mid - rapidities ,",
    "the lack of substantial dissipation in the qgp phase is in itself remarkable .",
    "calculations based on parton transport theory  @xcite predict large deviations from the ideal non - viscous hydrodynamic limit . instead",
    ", the data show that the qgp is almost a perfect fluid . a navier stokes analysis  @xcite is consistent with @xcite and shows that the viscosity of the qgp must be about ten times less than expected if the qgp were a weakly interactive debye screened plasma .",
    "this unexpected feature of the qgp must be due to nonperturbative and hence strong coupling physics that persists to at least @xmath10 .",
    "one intriguing theoretical possibility being explored in the literature @xcite is that the shear viscosity , @xmath88 , in the strongly coupled qgp may saturate at a universal super - string bound , @xmath89 .",

    "for an ultra - relativistic system , the entropy density is @xmath97 , therefore @xmath98 which is within 5% of the string theory bound .",
    "it is the consequence of the universality of the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "surprisingly , the qgp found at rhic saturates this uncertainty bound and the data clearly rule out the order of magnitude larger predictions based on pqcd  @xcite .",
    "see again  @xcite .",
    "the long wavelength modes in the qgp are as maximally coupled as @xmath99 allows .",
    "it is `` shear '' good luck that the mid rapidity initial conditions at rhic are dense enough to essentially eliminate the dilution of elliptic flow due to the imperfect hadron fluid formed after the spatial asymmetry vanishes .",
    "( recall that @xmath100 for @xmath101 @xcite ) . at lower energies or higher rapidities this good luck runs out and the mixture of near perfect qgp and imperfect hadronic fluid dynamics",

    "in addition to the breakdown of perfect fluid collectivity at high rapidity seen in fig.([line1figb ] ) , fig.([line1fig ] ) clearly shows that hydrodynamics also breaks down at very short wavelengths and high transverse momenta , @xmath102 gev .",
    "instead of continuing to rise with @xmath28 , the elliptic asymmetry stops growing and the difference between baryon vs meson @xmath53 reverses sign ! between @xmath103 gev the baryon @xmath104 exceeds the meson @xmath105 by approximately 3/2 .",
    "for such short wavelength components of the qgp , local equilibrium simply can not be maintained due the fundamental asymptotic freedom property of qcd .",

    "the fractional radiative energy loss of a high energy parton in an expanding qgp is proportional to the position weighed line integral over color charge density @xmath123 @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the color casimir of the jet parton and @xmath126 is a slowly varying function of the jet energy @xcite . the azimuthal angle sensitive escape time , @xmath127 , depends on the initial production point and direction of propagation relative to the elliptic flow axis of the qgp  @xcite . for a longitudinal expanding qgp , isentropic perfect fluid flow implies that @xmath128 is fixed by the initial gluon rapidity density . in this case",
    "@xmath129 therefore , gluon jets are expected to lose about @xmath130 more energy than quarks .",

    "detailed numerical studies show that the actual glv energy loss can account qualitatively for the saturation of @xmath131  @xcite , the unexpected @xmath28 independence  @xcite of the quenching pattern , the centrality dependence  @xcite of the suppression factor  @xcite , and the rapidity dependence  @xcite of @xmath132  @xcite for pions and high @xmath133  gev inclusive charged hadrons at rhic .",
    "to further illustrate qualitatively how ( [ dee2 ] ) influences the quench pattern , consider a simplified initial jet distribution rate , @xmath134 where @xmath135 . in applications",
    "these are of course calculated numerically . after passing through the qgp , the final jet @xmath136 .",
    "the average over fluctuations constrains @xmath137 .",
    "the quenched jet distribution is @xmath138 .",
    "the calculated hadron inclusive distribution is obtained by folding the quench jet distribution over the fragmentation function @xmath139 . however , in this illustrative example the fragmentation function dependence drops out , and the nuclear modification factor , @xmath140 reduces to @xmath141 the average over @xmath61 takes into account fluctuations of the radiative energy loss .",
    "the resulting @xmath142 is independent of @xmath28 in this approximation .",
    "this was also found in the detailed numerical work in @xcite . in central collisions , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , and the magnitude of quenching",
    "is fixed by @xmath145 .",
    "the centrality and azimuthal dependence for non - central collisions follows without additional calculations .",

    "this is a direct proof that the kinematic range studied tests the physics of pqcd binary parton collision processes . for central collisions , on the other hand , away",
    "side jet correlations are almost completely suppressed .",
    "the quantitative measure of the nuclear modification of di - jet correlations in @xmath151 reactions at a given @xmath36 is given by a formidable multi - variable function @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the trigger particle of flavor @xmath154 and the @xmath155 is an associated particle of flavor @xmath156 for collisions at an impact parameter @xmath157 with a collective flow axis , the reaction plane , fixing the azimuthal angle @xmath158 .",
    "obviously @xmath159 is a very powerful microscope to study the modification of short wavelength correlations in the strongly interacting qgp .",

    "the measured modification of di - jet correlations is obtained by subtracting out the correlations due to bulk elliptic flow via the di - jet measure @xmath163 where the number of triggered pairs @xmath164 is normalized relative to the expected number based on @xmath150 measurements in the same @xmath165 $ ] relative azimuthal angle range .",
    "wang  @xcite has analyzed the centrality , @xmath166 , dependence of @xmath167 as well as @xmath142 and showed that both can be understood from the same pqcd energy loss formalism .",
    "this provides another critical consistency check of jet tomography at rhic .    additional preliminary data from star presented by k. filimonov at quark matter 2004 showed the first direct evidence that back - to - back dijet quenching has a distinctive dependence on the azimuthal orientation of the jets relative to the reaction plane as expected from the obvious generalization of eq.([raa ] ) @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the initial transverse production point of the approximately back - to - back dijet moving in directions @xmath170 relative to the reaction plane @xmath158 .",
    "here @xmath171 the effective fractional energy loss per unit length in the qgp produced at impact parameter @xmath157 .",
    "the high @xmath172 trigger naturally biases @xmath169 to be near the surface and @xmath173 is biased toward the outward normal direction .",
    "this means that on the average , @xmath174 , and the away side fragments should be strongly suppressed in the most central collisions , while the near side fragment correlations should be similar to that seen in @xmath175 .",
    "however , in non - central minimum biased events , eq.([iaa ] ) naturally predicts the away side fragments are less quenched when the trigger hadron lies in the reaction plane than perpendicular to it , as observed by star .",
    "single and dijet data for pions above 3 gev and protons above 6 gev provide conclusive evidence that the qgp matter is partially opaque to short wavelength probes with a quenching pattern as predicted by the * pqcd * radiative energy loss : @xmath176 with the vastly increased statistics from the current rhic run 4 , the tests of consistency of the theory will be further extended to @xmath177 gev , and @xmath167 and @xmath178 will attain ever greater resolving power .",
    "in addition , heavy quark tomography  @xcite will provide new tests of the theory .",
    "only one year ago  @xcite the interpretation of high @xmath28 suppression was under intense debate because it was not yet clear how much of the quenching was due to initial state saturation ( shadowing ) of the gluon distributions and how much due to jet quenching discussed in the previous section .",
    "there was only one way to find out - eliminate the qgp final state interactions by substituting a deuterium beam for one of the two heavy nuclei .",
    "in fact , it was long ago anticipated  @xcite that such a control test would be needed to isolate the unknown nuclear gluon shadowing contribution to the a+a quench pattern .",
    "in addition @xmath25 was required to test predictions of possible initial state cronin multiple interactions  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , one model of cgc  @xcite predicted a 30% suppression in central d+au .",

    "will certainly teach us new physics .",
    "the experimental task of mapping out the novel properties of sqgp has only begun .",
    "it is important to concentrate , however , on those observables which are least distorted or `` polluted '' by uninteresting hadronic final interactions .",
    "for example , the severity of the hbt puzzle depends on which hadronic transport model is used .",
    "pure hydrodynamics with late freeze - out times fails badly to reproduce final state soft pion correlations .",
    "hybrid hydro+rqmd hadronic",
    "cascade does somewhat better  @xcite , but there is at least one transport model  @xcite that reproduced the data .",
    "non - equilibrium hadron resonance transport dynamics are unfortunately still not well enough understood at any energy to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn .",
    "thermal direct photons have yet to be measured , but it is already known that the pre - equilibrium  @xcite and hadronic final state contributions in the few gev @xmath28 range will produce large backgrounds on top of the thermal component .",
    "these must be deconvoluted if thermal photons are to serve as a sqgp thermometer",
    ". however , even the theoretical thermal photon rates are still under debate  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath38 suppression discovery at sps was originally attributed to debye screening of @xmath190 in a wqgp paradigm .",
    "recent lattice qcd results now indicate that heavy quark correlations persist perhaps up to @xmath191 .",
    "this is another indication for the strongly coupled nature of * sqcd*. the suppression of @xmath38 in @xmath35 is also strongly influenced by initial state and final state hadronic ( comover ) effects .",
    "it will be no easier to deconvolute these competing effects at rhic .",
    "these observables of course need to be measured at rhic , but one should not expect an easy interpretation .",
    "i believe that the most promising direction of future experiments at rhic will be precision measurements of short wavelength ( @xmath107 gev ) correlators @xmath159 illustrated in eq.([cab ] ) .",
    "these are very powerful six dimensional microscopes with four discrete @xmath192 and two continuously adjustable geometric @xmath193 experimental knobs in addition to the beam energy @xmath194  agev .",
