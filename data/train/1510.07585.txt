    "during our measurements of the ion position and of the static friction force , the ions have a finite temperature , estimated to be @xmath84 when the optical lattice depth @xmath4 is large ( @xmath85 ) . in this case , the effect of temperature can be nearly eliminated by moving the support faster than the thermal relaxation rate@xcite .",
    "we show here that even when @xmath4 is low and near the aubry transition point , where the pn energy barrier vanishes and the thermal relaxation rate is significant even at the fastest transport velocities , temperature only weakly affects the critical lattice depth @xmath0 extracted from our data . instead , temperature mainly affects how steeply the friction force @xmath38 increases with lattice depth @xmath4 above @xmath0 .",
    "to show this , we run a full dynamics simulation of our system , that is , an finite coulomb chain with inhomogenous spacings . for the maximally mismatched chain of @xmath70 ions ( the same arrangement as in the experiment ) ,",
    "we extract the static friction force @xmath38 versus lattice depth @xmath4 for several temperatures in the range @xmath86 , and extract the superlubricity - breaking point @xmath0 by fitting @xmath38 with a function of the form @xmath87 as was done with the experimental data ( @xmath78 is the heaviside step function ) .",
    "the fitted values @xmath0 and @xmath88 are plotted against temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig : suppfig1 ] .",
    "we observe that for our experimentally measured temperature of @xmath84 , the critical lattice depth @xmath0 is only pushed to higher values by @xmath89 10% relative to the @xmath90 limit .",
    "interestingly , the slope @xmath91 is decreased by more than a factor of two for the same temperature difference , but this does not affect our conclusions about the observed aubry transition .",
    "the harmonic confinement by external springs @xmath20 corresponds exactly to the axial confinement in the linear paul trap at angular vibrational frequency @xmath92 , which corresponds to the center - of - mass ( com ) motion of the chain .",
    "we take the interatomic springs @xmath16 to correspond roughly to the highest - energy mode of the chain , for which the next - neighbors near the center of the chain move in anti - phase .",
    "this gives the interatomic spring stiffness as @xmath93 .",
    "we show here why this is a valid approximation and how @xmath16 changes with @xmath15 .",
    "consider a small displacement @xmath94 of one of the ions in the chain on the order of the lattice constant @xmath30 .",
    "this is small compared to the equilibrium spacing of the ions in the paul trap , @xmath95 where @xmath29 is the distance between any two ions @xmath28 and @xmath6 in the chain .",
    "one can then approximate the neighbor spring forces by linearizing the coulomb forces around the equilibrium distance :    @xmath96    this gives the effective neighbor spring constant constant @xmath97 . from this expression",
    "we see that next - neighbor interactions dominate the mean - field interaction of a single ion with the rest of the chain , even for an infinite homogeneous chain : the sum of forces from farther neighbors , as a fraction of the nearest neighbor forces , is @xmath98 ( where @xmath99 is the riemann zeta function ) .    in our inhomogeneous ion crystal , the largest next - neighbor spring constant @xmath100",
    "is found for the center ion(s ) , where the next - neighbor separation is minimal . from numerical calculations ,",
    "we find that this largest spring constant agrees well with @xmath101 even for a few - ion chain , and this is the value of @xmath16 we use when plotting @xmath0 against @xmath53 in fig .  4a of the main text .",
    "for a fixed paul trap confinement @xmath102 , as ions are added to the trap , we find numerically that @xmath103 increases as @xmath104 due to closer confinement of neighboring ions in the center of the chain . as a result @xmath105 , allowing us to simply tune the fkt parameter @xmath53 with ion number @xmath15 .",
    "in this section , we expand on the connection between incommensurate infinite chains and mismatched finite chains .",
    "an infinite homogeneous chain is maximally incommensurate with a substrate when the ratio of its next neighbor spacing @xmath106 to the substrate spacing @xmath30 is the golden ratio : @xmath107 .",
    "the mismatch of a finite chain to a periodic substrate is characterized by the matching parameter @xmath108 , defined as the normalized barrier to translations of an infinitely rigid chain in that intrinsic arrangement@xcite : @xmath109max@xmath110sin@xmath111 $ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath112 for a matched chain , which is equivalent to @xmath10mod @xmath11 , and @xmath113 for a maximally mismatched chain .    for a finite homogeneous chain of @xmath15 atoms , such that @xmath15 is a number in the fibonacci sequence ( @xmath114 ) ,",
    "one choice of chain spacing that maximally mismatches it with the substrate ( i.e. @xmath113 ) is simply the @xmath115th rational approximation to the golden ratio ( where @xmath116 is the index of @xmath15 in the fibonacci series ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath117 , @xmath113 for @xmath118 which is the 2nd rational approximation to the golden ratio ; for @xmath119 , @xmath113 for @xmath120 which is the 3rd rational approximation to the golden ratio ; and for @xmath70 , @xmath113 for @xmath121 which is the 4th rational approximation to the golden ratio .",
    "these rational approximations are within @xmath54 of the true golden ratio @xmath83 . within the discrete fourier - limited resolution @xmath54 of a finite system of @xmath15 particles",
    ", this means that these spacings are practically indistinguishable from the golden ratio .",
    "this result extends to arbitrary @xmath15 . for a homogeneous chain of @xmath15 atoms , there exist @xmath122 choices of spacing @xmath123 where @xmath124 is an integer , such that the chain is mismatched ( @xmath113 ) to the substrate@xcite .",
    "it follows then that one can always find a value of @xmath125 such that @xmath113 and @xmath123 is within @xmath126 of the golden ratio .",
    "once again , this implies that this spacing is indistinguishable from the golden ratio within the fourier - limited resolution @xmath54 in a finite chain .",
    "this reconciles the intuitions that a finite system is maximally superlubric when maximally mismatched to the substrate ( @xmath113 ) , and that an infinite system is maximally superlubric ( statically , largest sliding phase ) when maximally incommensurate with the substrate .",

    "<S> massachusetts institute of technology    equal contributions    vuletic@mit.edu    the static arrangement of a chain of interacting atoms subject to the periodic potential of a substrate lattice is governed by the competition between the associated length and energy scales : the intrinsic chain spacing competes against the lattice spacing , and the elastic energy of the chain competes against the pinning energy of the lattice potential . </S>",
    "<S> aubry found a remarkable transition@xcite resulting from this competition when considering an infinite chain of atoms joined by springs and subject to an incommensurate sinusoidal lattice potential ( the frenkel - kontorova model@xcite , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : aubryfig1 ] ) . below a critical depth of the lattice potential @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , chain stiffness resists pinning and favors the chain s intrinsic arrangement , resulting in a translationally invariant sliding phase . above the critical depth </S>",
    "<S> , the lattice potential overcomes the stiffness of the chain , which becomes unstable against pinning . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms reorganize towards lattice minima and avoid lattice maxima , which become peierls - nabarro ( pn ) energy barriers . </S>",
    "<S> this results in analyticity - breaking in the atomic positions , which form an everywhere - discontinuous fractal pattern relative to the lattice period ( fig.[fig : aubryfig1]e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of an atomic chain subject to a periodic potential is central to understanding nanocontacts between solids@xcite ( fig.[fig : aubryfig1]a ) , composite materials@xcite , dislocations in crystals@xcite , adsorbed monolayers@xcite , and biomolecular transport@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> realistically , those situations involve a finite atom chain , which might additionally be attached to an external support . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , dynamical phenomena in those systems , such as friction , are of tremendous practical importance , yet remain poorly understood even at the few - atom level . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , stick - slip friction , which represents the dominant mode of energy dissipation and wear at the nanoscale , originates from chain pinning , and is thought to be intimately related to aubry s pinned phase@xcite , where the force required to move the chain over the finite pn barriers corresponds to the friction force . </S>",
    "<S> hence , below a critical lattice depth , such that pn barriers are absent , aubry s sliding phase should manifest dynamically in smooth translation of the chain over the lattice , known as superlubricity@xcite - nearly frictionless transport as a result of vanishing stick - slip friction . </S>",
    "<S> microscopic studies of friction@xcite have been performed experimentally with tools ranging from very sensitive nanotribology apparatuses@xcite to colloidal crystals in optical lattices@xcite . although signatures of superlubricity have been observed at the nanoscale@xcite , to our best knowledge , a direct and quantitative connection of these observations to aubry s sliding phase has never been established . </S>",
    "<S> following a number of proposals@xcite , we recently studied friction between chains of trapped yb@xmath1 ions and an optical lattice ( fig.[fig : aubryfig1]b ) with atom - by - atom control unavailable in condensed - matter systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that superlubricity can be achieved by structurally mismatching the ion chain to the optical lattice@xcite , and , studying the velocity and temperature dependence of friction@xcite , identified a regime where stick - slip friction is minimally affected by finite temperature . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> operating in the said regime , we observe a transition from superlubricity to stick - slip with increasing lattice depth . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously to this superlubricity breaking we observe a formation of discontinuities in the allowed ground - state ion positions , corresponding to aubry s analyticity breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the critical lattice depth of this transition in the few - ion chains agrees with aubry s analytic result in the infinite - chain limit extended to include finite external confinement@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we observe the aubry transition in a finite system , and establish qualitatively and quantitatively that the aubry transition and the onset of stick - slip friction represent static and dynamic aspects , respectively , of the same physical phenomenon . in our system@xcite , the atomic chain is a self - organized one - dimensional coulomb crystal of laser - cooled @xmath2yb@xmath1 ions spaced by a few micrometers in a linear paul trap . </S>",
    "<S> the periodic lattice potential , with lattice constant @xmath3 nm , is due to an optical dipole force on the atoms by a standing wave of light ( fig.[fig : aubryfig1]b ) . at finite depth </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 the lattice deforms the ion arrangement , which is specified by the position @xmath5 of each ion @xmath6 measured from the nearest lattice maximum ( fig.[fig : aubryfig1]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 corresponds to the intrinsic arrangement in the limit @xmath8 of an unperturbed chain ( fig.[fig : aubryfig1]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the intrinsic ion spacing @xmath9 is not uniform along the chain , it can be controlled with nanometer precision via the paul trap s axial confinement to match or mismatch the chain to the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the chain is matched when all neighboring ions are separated by an integer number of lattice periods @xmath10mod @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the chain is maximally mismatched when the sum of lattice forces on the ions at their intrinsic positions @xmath7 cancels@xcite : @xmath12sin@xmath13 for any @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this system is well described by a generalized frenkel - kontorova - tomlinson ( fkt ) model@xcite of a nanocontact , involving an @xmath15-atom chain joined by interatomic springs of stiffness ( spring constant ) @xmath16 ( given here by coulomb forces ) , and attached to a rigid support by external springs of stiffness @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the axial common - mode vibrational frequency in the paul trap , and @xmath19 is an ion s mass ( fig.[fig : aubryfig1]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> both components of chain stiffness @xmath16 and @xmath20 cause resistance to deformation and pinning by the lattice when the ion chain is mismatched .    in a weak lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the ion chain is deformed but still continuously distributed relative to the lattice , i.e. the ions assume all positions relative to the lattice as the support ( paul trap ) is translated along the lattice . in a sufficiently deep lattice , ions become pinned when they are excluded from regions near lattice maxima as a result of anti - confinement by the negative lattice potential curvature @xmath21 overcoming the confinement due to total chain stiffness ( @xmath16 and @xmath20 ) , and creating finite pn barriers there ( fig.[fig : aubryfig1]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this anti - confinement of a given ion near a lattice maximum , combined with interatomic forces further excludes other ions from other position ranges in the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> thus , analyticity breaking is the formation of discontinuities in the curve of an atom s position @xmath22 ( relative to the lattice ) versus its unperturbed position @xmath7 as the support is translated . </S>",
    "<S> the primary discontinuity is a gap near @xmath23 from @xmath24 on one side of the pn barrier to @xmath25 on the other side , and progressively smaller gaps form near @xmath26mod @xmath27 due to anti - confinement of progressively further neighbors @xmath28 in the chain at intrinsic distances @xmath29 away . for a finite mismatched chain of @xmath15 ions , each curve </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 should accordingly have @xmath15 gaps as the support is translated by one lattice period @xmath30 ( fig.[fig : aubryfig1]f ) . </S>",
    "<S> in the @xmath31 theoretical limit , for an incommensurate chain with irrational @xmath10mod @xmath32 , the curve of @xmath5 ( which coincides with the hull function@xcite ) forms a nowhere - analytic fractal staircase with an infinite number of gaps ( fig.[fig : aubryfig1]e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the primary gap parameterizes the aubry analyticity - breaking transition@xcite . in a finite chain </S>",
    "<S> , the primary gap for the center ion corresponds to displacement of this ion and the chain to one side of the emerging central pn barrier , parameterizing a reflection - symmetry - breaking transition that represents a finite version of the aubry transition@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of finite pn barriers , which give rise to the gaps in the static ground - state chain arrangement at the aubry transition , leads in the dynamic situation to stick - slip friction associated with the now bistable pn potential . consider the ions relative positions @xmath22 versus the support position @xmath33 ( or , equivalently , versus the intrinsic positions @xmath34 ) when the support is moved sufficiently quickly so that the chain does not have time to thermally relax across the pn barrier to the ground - state global minimum@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , the chain sticks to the metastable minimum below the static position gap , until the pn barrier vanishes , and a slip to the global minimum above the position gap occurs ( fig.[fig : aubryfig1]f ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the support is moved in the opposite direction , the chain sticks to the metastable minimum above the position gap before slipping back to the global minimum below the position gap . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamical process results in hysteresis loops enclosing the gaps in the static arrangement ( fig.[fig : aubryfig1]g ) . below the pinning transition </S>",
    "<S> , there are no pn barriers : the superlubric chain always follows the global minimum and the dynamic curves of @xmath5 coincide with the continuous static curves . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the hysteresis that can be used to measure friction@xcite across the superlubricity - breaking transition , can also be used to measure the opening of gaps in the atomic position distribution across the analyticity - breaking transition : the two are the dynamic and static aspects , respectively , of the aubry transition . </S>",
    "<S> we perform measurements on the system by applying an external electric force @xmath35 to quickly@xcite move back and forth the position @xmath36 of the axial trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic position curves @xmath22 are then reconstructed from the observed ion fluorescence@xcite . in the elementary case of a mismatched two - ion chain </S>",
    "<S> we observe two hysteresis loops for each ion : a large one due to the primary slips of the ion over its lattice maximum , and a smaller one due to secondary slips induced by the primary slips of the other ion ( fig.[fig : aubryfig2]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> these hysteresis loops correspond to the appearance of gaps in the allowed ion positions for the finite chain . </S>",
    "<S> the heights of the loops @xmath37 give the desired static gaps ( discontinuities ) in the atomic position distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the left and right edges of the loops correspond to the slipping events in the stick - slip process , and the separation between them equals twice the static friction force @xmath38 required to pull the chain over the corresponding pn barrier@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the area enclosed by the loops is the energy dissipated by stick - slip in the two slip events@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we observe these loops , and correspondingly the position gap @xmath37 and the static friction force @xmath38 , to grow with increasing lattice depth ( fig.[fig : aubryfig2]b ) as a result of growing pn barriers .    for chains of @xmath15=1 - 5 ions , </S>",
    "<S> the measured static friction force @xmath38 reveals that the hysteresis loops open up at a finite lattice depth @xmath0 separating an analytic ( @xmath39 ) and superlubric ( @xmath40 ) phase for @xmath41 from a gapped phase ( @xmath42 ) with finite friction ( @xmath43 ) for @xmath44 ( fig.[fig : aubryfig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the ions are matched to the lattice , analyticity and superlubricity are observed to break at @xmath45 for all @xmath15 ( fig.[fig : aubryfig3 ] inset ) as in the single - atom limit of the fkt model corresponding to the prandtl - tomlinson model@xcite . in other words , for a matched chain anti - confinement by the lattice only needs to overcome the external chain stiffness @xmath20 , as the interatomic springs remain at constant length , and play no role . </S>",
    "<S> when the ions are mismatched to the lattice , analyticity and superlubricity are observed to break at values of @xmath46 ( fig.[fig : aubryfig3 ] ) as interatomic springs of stiffness @xmath16 help keep the ions near their unperturbed positions against the lattice forces in the static limit , and store some of the lattice potential energy during motion . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is observed to increase with ion number as a result of increasing effective interatomic spring stiffness @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this stiffness is calculated by linearizing next - neighbor coulomb forces for small lattice - induced deformations @xmath47 , and these forces increase as ion separations @xmath9 decrease when more ions are loaded in the harmonic paul trap , leading to @xmath48 at the center of the chain@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the large-@xmath15 limit , the interatomic springs dominate the chain stiffness and the pinning behavior , and the system is well described by the frenkel - kontorova model@xcite . in this limit , and when the chain and the substrate are maximally incommensurate at a spacing ratio equal to the golden ratio @xmath49mod @xmath50 , the aubry transition should occur at the largest value @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> finite external confinement @xmath20 of an infinite golden - ratio ratio chain should increase this bound@xcite to @xmath52 . at the center of our finite chains , the measured values of @xmath0 at different values of @xmath53 , obtained for </S>",
    "<S> chains of different @xmath15 , coincide with the calculated values for the aubry transition in an infinite golden - ratio chain with the corresponding values of @xmath53 ( fig.[fig : aubryfig4]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , our finite inhomogeneous system simply tuned to cancel the lattice forces on an unperturbed arrangement of the chain is as robust against the breaking of analyticity and superlubricity as aubry s upper bound in an infinite , maximally incommensurate chain . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by the finite periodicity resolution @xmath54 set by the size of a finite system , which prevents distinguishing these two cases . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for the mismatched chain arrangements that are observed to follow the aubry upper bound , the intrinsic separations between neighboring ions @xmath55mod @xmath56 fall within @xmath54 of the golden ratio ( fig.[fig : aubryfig4]b ) .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we observe , with atom - by - atom control , the transition from superlubricity to stick - slip and from continuous to gapped position distributions in finite chains of atoms as a function of increasing interaction strength with a periodic substrate . </S>",
    "<S> we establish the connection between this transition , relevant for the interaction of real surfaces governed by finite - size nanocontacts , and aubry s theoretical concept of analyticity breaking in infinite chains . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this transition could become an exotic quantum phase transition in a regime with quantum tunneling of atoms between the lattice sites , possibly accessible in our system . </S>",
    "<S> this could lead to a quantum - mechanical picture of friction and of adsorbed monolayers , possibly relevant at the nanoscale and at cold surfaces .      </S>",
    "<S> our dynamic position curves @xmath22 are reconstructed from the observed ion fluorescence , which varies proportionally to the optical potential energy @xmath57 experienced by the ion . </S>",
    "<S> this is a result of our laser - cooling scheme , which uses the optical lattice to couple the vibrational levels @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the ion s quantized motion in the optical lattice well@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial dependence of this raman coupling is such that the off - resonant transition @xmath60 , which on resonance would be stronger by two orders of the lamb - dicke factor @xmath61 ( @xmath62 for our system ) , increases from lattice node to lattice anti - node proportionally to the optical potential . </S>",
