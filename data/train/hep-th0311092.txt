    "the bekenstein - hawking entropy of a black hole is s = a4 g [ one ] where @xmath1 is the area of the horizon .",
    "statistical mechanics then suggests that the hole should have @xmath2 states .",
    "but where are these states ? in this paper",
    "we suggest an answer to this question , and support our conjecture by a calculation related to the 3-charge extremal hole .",
    "string theory computations with extremal and near extremal systems have shown that d - brane states with the same charges and mass as the hole have precisely @xmath2 states @xcite .",
    "if we increase the coupling @xmath3 these states should give black holes @xcite .",
    "at least for extremal holes supersymmetry tells us that we can not gain or lose any states when we change @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we are thus forced to address the question : how do the @xmath4 configurations differ from each other in the gravity description ?",
    "early attempts to find ` hair ' on black holes were based on looking for small perturbations in the metric and other fields while demanding smoothness at the horizon .",
    "one found no such perturbations  the energy in a small deformation of the black hole solution would flow off to infinity or fall into the singularity , and the hole would settle down to its unique metric again .",
    "but if we _ had _ found such hair at the horizon we would be faced with an even more curious difficulty .",
    "we would have a set of ` microstates ' as pictured in fig.1(b ) , each looking like a black hole but differing slightly from other members of the ensemble .",
    "but if each microstate had a horizon as in the figure , then shouldnt we assign an entropy @xmath5 to it",
    "? if we do , then we have @xmath4 configurations , with _ each _",
    "configuration having an entropy @xmath6 .",
    "this makes no sense  we wanted the microstates to _ explain _ the entropy , not have further entropy themselves .",
    "this implies that if we do find the microstates in the gravity description , _ then they should turn out to have no horizons themselves_.    we face exactly the same problem if we conjecture that the configurations all look like fig.1(a ) but differ from each other near the singularity ; each configuration would again have a horizon , and thus an entropy @xmath4 of its own .",
    "the idea of @xmath7 duality @xcite adds a further twist to the problem .",
    "if string states at weak coupling become black holes at larger coupling , then one might think that the strings / branes are somehow sitting at the center @xmath8 of the black hole .",
    "the low energy dynamics of the branes is a cft .",
    "but the standard description of ads / cft duality says that the cft is represented by a geometry that is _ smooth _ at @xmath8 ( fig.[nfig2 ] ) .",
    "in particular there are no sources or singularities near @xmath8 .",
    "putting all this together suggests the following requirements for black hole ` hair ' :    ( a)there must be @xmath2 states of the hole .",
    "( b)these individual states should have no horizon and no singularity .",
    "( c)`coarse - graining ' over these states should give the notion of ` entropy ' for the black hole .",
    "this appears to be rather an extreme change in our picture of the black hole , particularly since ( b ) requires that the geometry of individual states differ significantly from the standard black hole metric everywhere in the interior of the hole , and not just within planck distance of the singularity .",
    "remarkably though , just such a picture of individual states was found for the 2-charge extremal d1-d5 system in @xcite@xcite .",
    "we take @xmath9 d5 branes wrapped on @xmath10 bound to @xmath11 d1 branes wrapped on the @xmath12 .",
    "cft considerations tell us that the entropy is @xmath13 , so the extremal ground state is highly degenerate . in the gravity description",
    "we should see the same number of configurations , except that in a classical computation this degeneracy would show up as a continuous family of geometries rather than discrete states .",
    "the _ naive _ metric that is usually written down for the d1-d5 state is pictured in fig.[nfig3 ]  it goes to flat space at infinity , and heads to a singularity at @xmath8 . but a detailed analysis shows the following @xcite :    ( a@xmath14)the actual classical geometry of the extremal d1-d5 system is found to be given by a family of states parametrized by a vector function @xmath15 ; upon quantization this family of geometries should yield the @xmath16 states expected from the entropy .",
    "( b@xmath14)individual members of this family of states have no horizon and no singularity  we picture this in fig.[nfig4 ] .",
    "( c@xmath14)suppose we define ` coarse graining ' for a family of geometries in the following way .",
    "we draw a surface to separate the region where the metrics are all essentially similar from the region where they differ significantly from each other ( indicated by the dashed line in fig.[nfig5 ] ) .",
    "the area @xmath1 of this ` horizon ' surface satisfies s [ two ] note that the properties a@xmath14,b@xmath14,c@xmath14 address directly the requirements a , b , c .",
    "the 2-charge d1-d5 extremal system has a ` horizon ' whose radius is small compared to other length scales in the geometry , and the entropy of this system is determined from the geometry only upto a factor of order unity ( this is the reason for the @xmath17 sign in ( [ two ] ) ) . the 3-charge system which has d1 , d5 and p charges (",
    "p is momentum along @xmath12 ) has a horizon radius that is of the same order as other scales in the geometry , and in the classical limit we get a reissner - nordstrom type black hole .",
    "the d - brane state entropy @xmath18 exactly equals @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we would therefore like to find individual geometries that describe different states of the 3-charge hole . in line with what was said above",
    ", we expect a situation similar to that in figs.[nfig3],[nfig4 ]  the _ naive _ d1-d5-p geometry has a horizon at @xmath8 , but _ actual _ geometries end smoothly ( without horizon or singularity ) before reaching @xmath8 .",
    "if this description of the 3-charge hole were true then it would imply a simple consequence : there should be smooth perturbations of the 2-charge ( d1-d5 ) system which add a small amount of the third ( momentum ) charge .",
    "thus we should find small perturbations @xmath20 around the 2-charge geometries with the following properties    ( i)the perturbation has momentum @xmath21 along the @xmath12 , which implies ~e^ipr y ,  p where @xmath22 is the coordinate along @xmath12 and @xmath23 is the radius of this @xmath12 .",
    "( ii)the perturbation takes the extremal 2-charge system to an extremal 3-charge so the energy of the perturbation should equal the momentum charge of the perturbation .",
    "this implies a @xmath24 dependence ~e^-it ,  = pr    ( iii)the perturbation must generate no singularity and no horizon , so it must be regular everywhere , and vanishing at @xmath25 so as to be normalizable .",
    "we start with a particular state of the 2-charge extremal system .",
    "we have a bound state of d1 and d5 branes , wrapped on a @xmath26 with volume @xmath27 and an @xmath12 of radius @xmath23 , sitting in asymptotically flat @xmath28 transverse spacetime .",
    "this system is in the ramond ( r ) sector , which has many ground states .",
    "we pick the particular one ( we call it @xmath29 ) which if spectral flowed to the ns sector yields the ns vacuum @xmath30 . the geometry for this 2-charge state is pictured in fig.[nfig6 ] .",
    "the radius of the @xmath31 in the region iii is @xmath32 .",
    "the parameter characterizes , roughly speaking , the ratio @xmath33 for the ` throat ' region iii .    in the ns sector",
    "we can act with a chiral primary operator on @xmath30 .",
    "let the resulting state be called @xmath34 .",
    "the spectral flow of this state to the r sector gives a state @xmath35 ; this will be an r ground state , and will have @xmath36 .",
    "we will construct the perturbation that will describe the cft state ( j_-1 ^ -)|_r [ three ] this state has momentum charge @xmath37 .",
    "we proceed in the following steps :    ( a)the regions iii and iv are actually a part of global @xmath38 , and a coordinate change brings the metric here to the standard form @xcite .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath39 for the state ( [ three ] ) in this region can be obtained by rotating a chiral primary perturbation in global @xmath40 .",
    "( b)we construct the appropriate wavefunction @xmath41 in the regions i , ii , iii by solving the supergravity equations in this part of the geometry .",
    "we choose a solution that decays at infinity .",
    "( c)we find that at leading order @xmath42 the solutions @xmath39 , @xmath41 agree in the overlap region iii .",
    "( d)we extend the computation to order @xmath43 and continue to find agreement in the overlap region ; this agreement appears to be highly nontrivial , and we take it as evidence for the existence of the solution satisfying ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) above .",
    "after this computation we conclude with some conjectures about the form of ` hair ' for generic states of the 3-charge hole , and a discussion of the physics underlying the new picture of the black hole interior that emerges from this structure of microstates .",
    "in this section we review the results obtained earlier for the 2-charge d1-d5 system and describe the particular d1-d5 background to which we will add the perturbation carrying momentum charge p.      consider iib string theory compactified on @xmath10 .",
    "the d1-d5 system can be mapped by a set of @xmath44 dualities to the fp system @xmath45 the _ naive _ metric of the fp bound state in string frame is ds^2=-(1+qr^2)^-1(dudv+qr^2dv^2)+dx_idx_i+dz_adz_a [ naivefp ] where @xmath46 are the noncompact directions , @xmath47 are the @xmath26 coordinates , and we have smeared all functions on @xmath26 .",
    "we will also use the definitions u = t+y ,  v = t - y    but in fact the bound state of the f and p charges corresponds to a fundamental string ` multiwound ' @xmath9 times around @xmath12 , with all the momentum p being carried on this string as traveling waves .",
    "since the f string has no longitudinal vibrations , these waves necessarily cause the strands of the multiwound string to bend away and separate from each other in the transverse directions .",
    "the possible configurations are parametrized by the transverse displacement @xmath15 ; we let this vibration be only in the noncompact directions @xmath48 .",

    "the explanation for this fact was pointed out in a nice calculation in @xcite where it was shown that the singularity ( for generic @xmath57 ) is a _ coordinate _ singularity ; it is the same coordinate singularity as the one encountered at the origin of a kaluza - klein monopole @xcite .",
    "the family of geometries ( [ six ] ) thus have the form pictured in fig.[nfig4 ] .",
    "these geometries are to be contrasted with the ` naive ' geometry for the d1-d5 system ds^2_naive=1[-dt^2+dy^2]+dx_idx_i+dz_adz_a [ naive ] the actual geometries ( [ six ] ) approximate this naive geometry everywhere except near the ` cap ' .",
    "it is important to note that we can perform dynamical experiments with these different geometries that distinguish them from each other . in @xcite",
