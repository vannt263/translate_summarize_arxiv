    "guiding bright solitons by pure sdf nonlinearities , without the help of a linear potential , was considered obviously impossible , until it was recently demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite- @xcite that this is possible if the strength of the local sdf nonlinearity grows fast enough in space from the center to periphery , as a function of the radial coordinate , @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of bright solitons in this case is a consequence of the fact that the growth of the nonlinearity coefficient makes the underlying equations _",
    "nonlinearizable _ for the decaying tails ( hence , the superposition principle is not valid for them ) , i.e. , it  makes unnecessary placing the propagation constant of the soliton into the semi - infinite spectral gap of the linearized system , where sdf nonlinearities can not support any self - localization .",
    "a similar spatially inhomogeneous setting may support bright solitons under the action of the nonlocal sdf nonlinearity @xcite . independently , in ref . @xcite it was demonstrated that the uniform sdf nonlinearity may support bright solitons in a more exotic model , where the local diffraction coefficient decays at @xmath1 . although the latter model is not equivalent to those introduced in refs .",
    "barcelona_slow and @xcite , the mechanisms supporting bright solitons in these  nonorthodox \" settings are similar .",
    "the main subject of the present work is a possibility to create bright discrete solitons in two distinct one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice settings with inhomogeneous sdf onsite nonlinearities .",
    "first is a discrete counterpart of the system introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the discrete nonlinear - schrdinger ( dnls ) /gross - pitaevskii equation for the field amplitude in optical media , or the mean - field wave function of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . as reviewed in ref .",
    "barcelona_review , spatially inhomogeneous nonlinearities can be realized in various ways in optics @xcite .",
    "for example , in photorefractive materials ( such as linbo@xmath2 ) nonuniform doping with cu or fe , which provide for the two - photon resonance , may be used for this purpose @xcite . in the bec , spatially",
    "modulated nonlinearity can be created , via the feshbach resonance , by nonuniform external fields @xcite .",
    "our goal is to construct discrete localized modes , of both staggered ( st ) and unstaggered ( unst ) types , in this setting , and investigate their stability and dynamics .",
    "only the former type exists and may be stable in discrete media with the sdf uniform onsite nonlinearity .",
    "therefore , we chiefly focus on stable unst localized modes , the existence of which is the most nontrivial finding . in fact , the staggering transformation makes these modes tantamount to st ones in the lattice with the inhomogeneous focusing nonlinearity , which is a counter - intuitive result too , as such discrete solitons do not exist in uniform lattices @xcite .",
    "the second setting is the semi - infinite lattice with the sdf inhomogeneous nonlinearity .",
    "this discrete system generically supports surface solitons of the st type , similarly to the periodic truncated potentials in solid state media , where staggered localized modes pinned to the surface were first realized as localized electronic modes ( the tamm states ) in solid - state media @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the self - trapping of light near the edge of a waveguide array with self - focusing nonlinearity can lead to the formation of discrete unst surface solitons @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the surface modes acquire novel properties , different from those of discrete solitons in infinite lattices , such as a threshold power ( norm ) necessary for the existence of the surface solitons , and a possibility of coexistence of two surface modes , stable and unstable ones , at the same power . generally , the existence and stability of diverse localized surface modes in semi - infinite nonlinear lattices are the result of the interplay between the nonlinearity and discreteness of the array , on the one hand , and the presence of the edge in the lattice , on the other . in this context ,",
    "our goal is to investigate a possibility to generate different types of surface bright discrete solitons , and analyze their stability and dynamical properties , in the case when the local sdf strength grows from the edge into the depth of the lattice . in this case too , we are chiefly interested in the surface modes of the unst type , which are impossible at the edge of a uniform truncated lattice with the sdf onsite nonlinearity",
    ".    we also introduce and briefly consider a discrete counterpart of the above - mentioned model with the uniform sdf nonlinearity and decaying diffraction coefficient @xcite , which corresponds to the inter - site coupling constant in the lattice , exponentially decaying with the increase of the discrete coordinate , @xmath3 . unlike the continuous medium , where it is difficult to realize a decreasing diffraction coefficient , in the lattice it merely implies a gradually growing spacing between the sites , as the coupling constant depends on it exponentially . while this model is very different from the one with the growing onsite sdf nonlinearity , unst solitons , which are impossible in the uniform setting ,",
    "are supported in it by a similar mechanism .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the models are introduced .",
    "the existence and stability of the unst and st discrete solitons in the infinite inhomogeneous lattice are reported in section iii .",
    "in addition to numerical results , this section also presents a variational approximation ( va ) developed in an analytical form .",
    "numerical and analytical results , including particular exact solutions and the va , for the unst and st surface solitons in the truncated lattice are reported in section iv .",
    "the paper is concluded by section v , where , in particular , we discuss a two - dimensional generalization of the system , and give some preliminary results for it too .",
    "we here introduce two 1d discrete models in the form of the dnls equations in the infinite and semi - infinite lattices ( waveguide arrays , in terms of optics ) .",
    "the sdf onsite nonlinearity is assumed to grow exponentially from the central site in both directions in the infinite lattice , and from the edge towards the bulk in the semi - infinite one .",
    "it is necessary to stress that the steep growth of the local nonlinearity does not imply that one should use , for instance , a steeply growing density of the dopants ( in the optical realization of the system ) .",
    "instead , it is enough to assume that the density is uniform across the lattice , but the detuning of the two - photon resonance is gradually reduced from large to small values by means of a slightly inhomogeneous mechanical stress , or by means of the zeeman or stark shift . in any case , this mode of the resonance adjustment strongly affects only the local nonlinearity , but does not introduce a conspicuous linear potential , hence effects of the nonlinearity modulation may be studied in the  pure \" form @xcite .    it is commonly known that lattices with the homogeneous sdf nonlinearity , both infinite and semi - infinite ones , give rise to bright discrete solitons of the st type , while unst localized modes can not be created in such lattices @xcite . in comparison with the infinite lattice , the truncation introduces an effective repulsive potential for discrete solitons , which acts in the combination with the periodic ( peierls  nabarro @xcite , @xcite ) potential induced by the lattice . as a result ,",
    "st surface solitons are created if their norm ( power ) exceeds a certain threshold value , at which the discreteness may overcome the repulsion from the surface . as we demonstrate below , properties of the st discrete solitons , in the infinite and truncated lattices alike , are not affected dramatically by the spatial modulation of the nonlinearity , while it opens the way to the creation of a completely novel species of unst discrete solitons .",

    "accordingly , the linear - stability analysis shows that the exact solution is unstable ( not shown here in detail ) .    the most essential numerical results concern the existence and stability of unst solitons centered at the lattice surface .",
    "we have performed this analysis for various values of parameters @xmath65 and @xmath121 , and for nonlinearity - modulation steepness taking values in the interval of @xmath122 , where stable unst surface solitons can be found ( as well as in the previous section , this limitation is imposed by the numerical scheme used , rather than by the system itself ) .",

    "[ figure1a](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "this finding agrees with the variational results ( [ ava ] ) and ( cutoff - surf ) , which predict that the threshold is zero for the unst solitons .",
    "the absence of the threshold has obvious implications for the physical realizations of the system , strongly facilitating the creation of the solitons .",
    "unlike the st surface solitons , whose shape is almost independent of the nonlinearity - modulation rate @xmath69 , the shape of the unst solitons is quite sensitive to @xmath69 . as illustrated in fig .",

    "( c ) profiles of the exact analytical solution for the unstaggered surface soliton and its numerically found counterpart ( their coincidence verifies that the analytical and numerical solutions belong to the same branch ) , for @xmath131 , @xmath124 , and @xmath129 . ,",
    "it is commonly known that the only localized modes in lattices with the homogeneous sdf ( self - defocusing ) nonlinearity are represented by st ( staggered ) solitons . here , we have demonstrated that infinite and semi - infinite ( truncated ) lattices support stable discrete unst ( unstaggered ) solitons too , provided that the strength of the onsite sdf nonlinearity grows rapidly enough from the center towards the periphery .",
    "the physical implementation of this setting may be provided by decreasing the detuning of the underlying resonance ( the two - photon one in optics , or the feshbach resonance in the bec ) in the same direction , from the center to periphery .",
    "families of the unst solitons have been found in the numerical form , and also reproduced by the va ( variational approximation ) .",
    "in addition to that , particular exact solutions were found for the unst surface solitons in the semi - infinite lattice .",
    "stability regions for the unst solitons have been found by means of the calculation of eigenvalues for perturbation modes , and verified by means of direct simulations .",
    "a noteworthy result is vanishing of the threshold value of the total power ( norm ) necessary for the existence of the surface unst solitons in the truncated lattice . in both the infinite and truncated ones ,",
    "the stable unst solitons coexist with the ( usual ) stable st - soliton families .",
    "the settings considered here may be implemented for matter waves in bec trapped in deep optical lattices , and for light waves in arrays of optical waveguides .",
    "in addition to that , we have also introduced and briefly considered the lattice with the uniform sdf nonlinearity and exponentially decaying inter - site coupling .",
    "physically , the latter feature can be readily provided by gradual increase of the lattice spacing .",
    "discrete unst solitons may exists in this system too , despite the sdf sign of the nonlinearity .",
    "this work can be naturally extended in other directions .",
    "in particular , it may be interesting to study a similar system based on a set of two parallel linearly coupled lattices , i.e. , a discrete nonlinear coupler , which is known in both infinite @xcite and semi - infinite @xcite forms .",
    "a challenging problem is to generalize the analysis for two - dimensional ( 2d )  lattices . in particular",
