    "as a bright and variable system in almost all wavelength regions , hr  1099 ( v711  tau ; hd  22468 ) has been the subject of many past observations from radio to x - ray wavelengths .",
    "hr  1099 is a short - period ( p@xmath10 2.83774 d ) binary composed of a g5 dwarf and a k1 subgiant .",
    "the system lies at a hipparcos distance of 29 pc @xcite .",
    "the orbital and rotational periods of the stars are tidally synchronized .",
    "the mass ratio is 1.3 , yet the k subgiant outsizes the g subgiant by a factor of three in radius .",
    "the orbital inclination is @xmath1 33@xmath11 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and there are no eclipses . because of its spectroscopic characteristics and highly active chromospheric , transition region , and coronal emissions , hr  1099 is a member of the rs  cvn class of binary systems .",
    "many of the phenomena seen on rs  cvn systems have solar counterparts , and invite the comparison between `` hyper - active '' stars such as these and less active stars like the sun .",
    "a schematic of the generally accepted model for solar flares proceeds as follows : a flare begins with a source of free energy , thought to originate from magnetic reconnection high in the solar corona .",
    "some of this energy is used to accelerate electrons to moderately relativistic speeds .",
    "electron beams can be generated , and propagate outward or into the atmosphere ; the electron beams emit plasma radiation ( type iii bursts ) , whose frequencies trace the ambient plasma density the beams encounter as they propagate either outward or into the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "downward - directed accelerated electrons can become magnetically trapped in the coronal loop or arcade , and emit gyrosynchrotron emission at microwave frequencies . as the electrons impact the denser regions of the lower atmosphere , they deposit their energy , emitting hard x - rays via nonthermal bremsstrahlung emission and white light continuum emission at the footpoints of the loops .",
    "the energy deposited by the electrons in the lower atmosphere heats plasma to coronal temperatures on a timescale short compared to the hydrodynamic expansion time , ablating material at 10@xmath1210@xmath13 k up the coronal loops , where it emits soft x - ray radiation .",
    "as the coronal density increases coronal material can stop the energetic electrons higher up in the atmosphere thereby heating the corona directly .",
    "once the nonthermal energy input has ceased , the material in the loop condenses into the chromosphere and the soft x - ray emission returns to its preflare state .",
    "this scenario implies a set of related and correlated variations that should be observable in different spectral regions .    despite the relatively advanced state of understanding of multi - wavelength solar flare emissions ,",
    "there is a paucity of observations on the stellar side .",
    "part of this may result from the difficulties inherent in organizing such an observing campaign for stellar flares ; but the potential benefits to understanding stellar flares must surely outweigh the enormous effort needed to coordinate such observations .",
    "@xcite showed that there existed an almost linear relationship between stellar quiescent radio and soft x - ray emission , suggesting that coronal heating and particle acceleration are closely linked in a way that may be similar to solar flares .",
    "in one of the earliest studies of multi - wavelength emission , @xcite examined optical , uv , and radio observations of two rs  cvn systems ( one of them hr  1099 ) and said `` there are suggestive coincidences between peak radio flux density and optical - uv emission activity from both systems . '' other studies of multi - wavelength stellar flares have revealed a zoo of phenomena , leading to split opinions as to whether such correlations even exist . in one of the earliest simultaneous studies , @xcite examined radio and x - ray observations of four flare stars .",
    "while they noted some x - ray bursts coincided in time or were preceded by 1015 minutes by 20 cm radio flares , they still claimed the degree of correlation was low .",
    "@xcite observed the decay of a radio flare on the rs  cvn system ei  eri but did not see an accompanying x - ray or euv flare .",
    "yet @xcite found uv and microwave flaring occuring during an x - ray outburst on the rs  cvn system @xmath14  crb .",
    "@xcite investigated the m dwarf binary system eq  peg with radio , optical , euv and x - ray wavelengths and found two populations of x - band ( 3.6 cm ) flares : highly polarized flares with no counterparts at shorter wavelengths , and moderately polarized flares which do have shorter wavelength counterparts .",
    "recently , @xcite established a correlation of radio flares with x - ray flares on @xmath14  crb , with x - ray flares peaking up to 1.4 hours before the radio peak . and most recently , @xcite conducted coordinated uv , euv , x - ray and radio observations on hr  1099 and detected a large uv flare not seen in higher energy emissions .",
    "the flare mechanism is a poorly understood phenomenon , even when considered in a single wavelength region ( or on a very well - studied star like the sun ) .",
    "expectations that stellar flares mimic the behavior of solar flares can introduce biases into the interpretation of multi - wavelength studies .",
    "also , it is necessary to recognize the importance of time delays between different wavelength regions when studying flares in a multi - wavelength context and the necessity of long exposure times to catch and observe flares in their entirety .",
    "this paper describes the results of four campaigns which observed hr  1099 in multiple wavelength regions , in 1993 , 1994 , 1996 , and 1998 .",
    "a summary of these campaigns is given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "section  [ sec : prevobs ] summarizes previous observations of hr  1099 ; section  [ sec : ch5datred ] describes the observations and initital data reduction ; section  [ sec : anal ] examines the wavelength regions individually across the time span of these four campaigns ;   [ sec : multi ] investigates comparisons between the different wavelength regions investigated ; and   [ sec : ch5conc ] concludes .",
    "much is known about the starspot distribution on hr  1099 : the subgiant primary of hr 1099 is one of the brightest stars to show evidence for spots in its photosphere , and has been the subject of numerous photometric and doppler imaging campaigns since 1975 .",
    "@xcite presented a study of 11 years of doppler images of the stellar surface that display the long term stability of a cool polar spot and lower latitude spots that vary on less than one year timescales .",
    "the polar spot , together with a low degree of shearing and nearly solid body rotation of the other spots detected , led @xcite to suggest the presence of a global multi - kilogauss dipolar magnetic field on the star .",
    "@xcite used the technique of zeeman doppler imaging to detect magnetic features , and deduced magnetic fields whose average strength was 985 g covering 8% of the total stellar surface .",
    "a longer term study of magnetic features by @xcite found that a significant fraction of the magnetic flux comes from regions at photospheric temperatures ; i.e. , there was no spatial correlation between brightness and magnetic inhomogeneities .",
    "they determined variations in the orbital period with a period of 18 years , and deduced a magnetic activity cycle period of @xmath15 12 years from a lack of polarity reversal during their 6 years of observations .",
    "other attempts to determine cycle periods from photometry have indicated similarly long timescales : @xcite from 18 years of photometry determined two periodicities in the mean v magnitudes from their spot solutions of 5.5 and 16 years .",
    "@xcite used 22 years of monitoring and found a cycle period of 16.5 years along with a secondary period of 3.5 years .",
    "this second period is in agreement with @xcite s finding of a weak periodicity in the area of the polar spot of about 3 years .",
    "while there is a consensus that long - term cyclic behavior is at work on hr 1099 , the lack of consensus on a timescale for this periodicity hampers any attempt to place our observations in the context of an activity trend .",
    "@xcite reported on _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ observations of a flare on hr  1099 in 1981 , in which the mg ii @xmath16 line profile displayed a broad component of 66 km s@xmath17 and was redshifted by 90@xmath1830 km s@xmath17 . the electron density at 10@xmath19 k was a factor of 15 larger during the peak of the flare than in the quiescence preceding the flare .",
    "@xcite made an association between broad wings in ultraviolet ( uv ) emission lines as seen by the _",
    "goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) _ and micro - flaring in the chromosphere and transition region of hr  1099 .",
    "@xcite used _ iue _ observations from 1992 to investigate velocity variations in the mg ii @xmath20 line which they attributed to emission from a localized region in the stellar chromosphere of the primary . in coordinated _ iue _ and _ ghrs _ observations in 1993 ,",
    "@xcite saw several flare enhancements in uv line emission ; one such enhancement lasted more than 24 hours as seen with _",
    "@xcite discussed a pointed exosat observation of hr  1099 in 1981 , in which a small flare with factor of two enhancement occurred .",
    "the light curve also displayed smaller amplitude variability on timescales of 5001000 seconds , which @xcite explained as evidence of flare - like heating in the corona of hr  1099 . from spectral fits to the data , @xcite found evidence for coronal temperatures of 3 and 25 mk .",
    "@xcite saw modulation in the light curve of _ extreme ultraviolet explorer ( euve ) _ observations at the level of 40% , which they attributed to rotational modulation of a starspot .",
    "contemporaneous optical photometry showed a light minimum which leads the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) maximum by 90 degrees in phase .",
    "@xcite presented radio data featuring several large flares on hr  1099 in 1978 with flux densities reaching up to 1 jy at 10.5 ghz .",
    "@xcite performed 8.4 ghz very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations and found radio emission from a source comparable in size to that between the surfaces of the two stars in the binary system ( 0.9 mas ) during a large radio outburst of 400 mjy .",
    "@xcite modeled very large array ( vla ) and australia telescope compact array ( atca ) quiescent observations and determined from gyrosynchrotron model fits that a highly organized magnetic field was necessary to explain the data .",
    "@xcite reported on vlbi 5 ghz observations during a large flare whose source size increased to a size comparable to the entire binary system .",
    "@xcite report the results of a radio monitoring campaign at 5 ghz from 19901993 which detected several large flares with flux densities of up to 800 mjy .",
    "@xcite performed a 5 ghz european vlbi network ( evn ) observation of hr 1099 simultaneously with our observing campaign in 1998 .",
    "they found an overall size of the radio source , during quiescence , comparable to the angular diameter of the active k star and thus much smaller than the active period radio source previously observed by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented results from five years of radio monitoring at 2.3 and 8 ghz with the green bank interferometer , and found periodicities of flaring cycles at @xmath21 120 days , and a weaker period of @xmath21 81 days , with 8.3 ghz flare fluxes reaching a peak of 1.44 jy . in a related note , @xcite now have succeeded in spatially resolving an x - ray limb flare on the magnetically active star in algol , so we may soon see the first image of a flare on hr  1099 .",

    "@xcite with emphasis on high - resolution grating spectroscopy ( see   [ sec : hr1099ascasec ] for a discussion ) .",
    "since the nature of this study is to investigate both short- and long - term variability in this active binary system , the number of individual observations that comprise the whole study is large and spans many years .",
    "such a collaborative effort involves numerous people , and several papers have been written analyzing individual datasets within this large study .",
    "the current investigation does present a reanalysis of several datasets which have been considered by others .",

    "the _ euve _ data ( lightcurves and spectra ) have been discussed in a number of papers , including : @xcite .",
    "the context of the _ euve _ analysis in the present paper is to examine the light curve and spectral variability on a flare - to - flare basis , which was not the focus of previous investigations .",
    "preliminary analysis of the various x - ray datasets has been provided in @xcite .",
    "the current analysis of the x - ray datasets is a detailed examination of both spectral and light curve changes .",
    "we discuss the observations in order of decreasing wavelength .",
    "a summary of all the observations appears in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "hr  1099 was observed with the nrao vla radio array for all four of the campaigns .",
    "the observations were performed in two subarrays , in order to obtain simultaneous multi - frequency observations .",
    "typically one subarray observed at 3.6 cm , while the other switched between 6 and 20 cm .",
    "sparse coverage at 2 cm was included to extend frequency coverage for spectral index determinations , but only general information on activity levels at 2 cm can be gleaned .",
    "the flux calibrator for all frequencies for all vla observations was 0137 + 331 , with a flux density of 1.81 jy at 2 cm , 3.29 jy at 3.6 cm , 5.52 jy at 6 cm , and 15.97 jy at 20 cm .",
    "the phase calibrator for all frequencies for all the vla observations was 0323 + 055 , with measured flux densities at 2 cm of 0.22 jy , 3.6 cm of 0.43 jy , 6 cm of 0.83 jy , and 20 cm of 2.79 jy .",
    "the 1993 vla data were obtained at 3.6 , 6 , and 20 cm ( 8.41 , 4.89 , 1.46 ghz ) , while the remaining three years of observations were at 2 , 3.6 , 6 , and 20 cm ( 14.96 , 8.41 , 4.89 , 1.46 ghz ) . in 1993 , the observations were taken in dnc array on september 13.618.4 ; with 45.8 hours of time on source at 3.6 and 6 cm .",

    "the 1998 observation suffered from extremely high background due to increased solar radiation as the sun approached a maximum in its cycle .",
    "good time intervals were generated based on filtering times of high background and large deadtime and primbsch corrections , and the exposure time for the spectrometer data were corrected for these effects by dividing by the correction factors .",
    "spectral extraction of the short wavelength ( sw ; 80180  ) and medium wavelength ( mw ; 180380  ) spectrometer data followed the procedures used in @xcite and references therein .",
    "there was no preset distinction between quiescent and flaring times based on flux levels .",
    "rather , the attempt was made to investigate flares on an individual basis .",
    "flares can have a range in peak luminosity , as is known from solar and other stellar studies @xcite , and the `` quiescent '' level can also vary , so a cut - off based on count rate or luminosity would miss the early and late stages of a flare , or miss a flare with a small enhancement above quiescence entirely .",
    "light curves were examined and the beginning and ending of flares were identified based on a smooth increase to peak and smooth decrease from peak .",
    "this allows us to examine low - level flares as well as larger events , attempt to characterize them , and compare and contrast derived properties .",
    "this is more subjective that using a threshold , but allows for a more nuanced approach to studying coronal variability .",
    "we divided the observations into segments according to activity state .",
    "we then summed time segments to provide spectra with decent statistics while still being able to discriminate between times of varying activity .",
    "in addition to performing the time - resolved spectroscopy , we used the segments from across the four years to build up spectra that represent a composite of the different activity states of the system .",
    "we also used ds@xmath9s pointed observations of the system in 1992 october and 1999 september to boost the signal to noise .",
    "we summed all the quiescent spectra to obtain a high - quality spectrum of quiescence . in the same way we summed all the flare spectra to obtain a high - quality composite spectrum of flaring . in this way",
    "we can determine gross differences between quiescence and flaring , and compare these to differences that may arise from flare to flare .",

    "`` flaring '' can be defined objectively , such as the level where the count rate exceeds the average count rate by some factor .",
    "however , solar ( and stellar ) flares can exist in a range of luminosities such that small light curve modulations could be evidence of the lower end of the flare luminosity distribution ; this would hinder our efforts to perform time - resolved spectral analysis of differences between `` flares '' and `` quiescence '' .",

    "x - band refers to a wavelength of 3.6 cm ( frequency of 8 ghz ) , c - band refers to a wavelength of 6 cm ( frequency of 5 ghz ) , and l - band refers to a wavelength of 20 cm ( frequency of 1.4 ghz ) .",
    "figures  [ 1993radioflux ] through  [ 1998radiopol ] show the light curves of flux and polarization variations for the different frequencies in the four years of observation .",
    "variations are most obvious at 3.6 and 20 cm , although they are also evident at other frequencies . the polarizations of 2 , 3.6 , and 6 cm data are generally positive , i.e. , right circularly polarized .",
    "in contrast , the polarizations at 13 and 20 cm can be rcp , but during some flares the polarization becomes highly negatively ( left ) polarized .",
    "we term this behavior , which exhibits large levels of circular polarization and generally chaotic flux variations with time , as a burst , to distinguish it from flaring behavior seen at higher radio frequencies . during two highly polarized events at 13 and 20 cm , the 6 cm emission is also left circularly polarized .",
    "there is a general trend of declining flux and activity in later observing campaigns  the 1993 observations had the largest 3.6 cm flux levels and several large flares , but by 1998 the 3.6 cm flux levels are generally much smaller and there are few to no flares at 3.6 cm .",
    "these trends can be seen in the average flux and circular polarization values for the four years at 3.6 cm , listed in table  [ radiotable ] .",
    "the average flux declines and the average polarization increases , from 1993 to 1998 ; also evident is the decrease in the standard deviation of the average fluxes , indicating a decreasing amount of flux variability .",
    "these general trends are consistent with results reported previously by @xcite who noted an inverse correlation between flux level and percent circular polarization for rs  cvn systems .",
    "the decrease in the average flux density also implies a decrease in the level of `` quiescence '' during the four years of the observations .",
    "this is harder to quantify than an average flux density , but an inpsection of figures  [ 1993radioflux ] through  [ 1998radioflux ] shows that the typical flux densities of times when no significant variability took place decreased from 1993  1998 : in 1993 the level was 4050 mjy , while in 1998 it was of order 8 mjy .",
    "@xcite monitored hr  1099 at 8 and 2.3 ghz using the green bank interferometer , from 19952000 , with several observations per day . while several large flares ( peak fluxes up to 1.4 jy ) were evident on hr  1099 during this interval , none occurred near the times of our multi - wavelength campaigns in 1996 september and 1998 september , suggesting that the system was in a relatively inactive state during these times",
    ".    a closer look at several of the 3.6 cm flares also reveals a temporal pattern similar to the broader trend noticed by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ radioflare ] show patterns of flux and polarization variations at 3.6 cm which illustrate this trend . @xcite",
    "only used averages from observations , not a closely spaced temporal sequence .",
    "there is a hint in the flare on 1993 september 16 that the circular polarization reaches its minimum value before the flux level peaks .",
    "this effect described in figure  [ radioflare ] for the 3.6 cm data is even clearer in the 20 cm data illustrated in figure  [ radioflare3 ] .",
    "inspection of the flares on 1994 august 26 and 1996 september 7 reveals that this is in fact the case : for the 1996 september 7 flare the flux peaks at september 7.361778 , and the polarization has its minimum at september 7.35398 , @xmath1 11 minutes earlier . for the 1994 august 26 flare the difference in time between the peak in the flux and the minimum in the polarization",
    "is only @xmath21 2 minutes , using a data sampling of 1 minute .",
    "we can investigate the polarization of the flares by assuming a two - component model , composed of a quiescent source with flux i@xmath32 and polarization @xmath33 , and a flare source with flux i@xmath34 and polarization @xmath35 ; the relation between the individual stokes parameters and fractional circular polarization for the quiescent source , flare source , and sum can be expressed as + @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 if the flares are completely unpolarized , then @xmath39 .",
    "we use values of quiescent flux and percent circular polarization determined from pre - flare averages , and plot the expected variation of total polarization during the flare as the flare flux changes .",
    "this is depicted in the middle panel of figure  [ radioflare ] in red crosses and red circles . during the flare rise ,",
    "the observed trends are consistent with an unpolarized flare emission source . at later stages in the flare , there is more observed circular polarization during the flare than is predicted , indicating that a small amount of flare polarization is present .",
    "equation  [ poleqn ] implies a small amount of rcp ( up to @xmath1 20% ) during the late stages of the flare .",
    "we determined estimates of peak luminosities and energies of several radio flares .",
    "the flare energies were determined by integrating the observed flare light curve points , after subtraction of an estimated constant quiescent flux .",
    "conversion to cgs units was done using 1 mjy = 10@xmath40 erg @xmath41 s@xmath17 hz@xmath17 , and the hipparcos distance to hr  1099 ( 29 pc ) .",
    "determinations were made for every frequency where the flare was obvious  typically , x- and c - bands .",
    "results are given in table  [ tbl : radfltbl ] .",
    "the temporal evolution of the flux density at 3.6 and 6 cm for most of these flares is remarkably similar .",
    "the monotonic decay of microwave emission during the flare decays is indicative of well - trapped electrons .",
    "flaring behavior at 20 cm has completely different characteristics than that displayed at lower wavelengths .",
    "there are flares at 20 cm that display a change in polarization as the flux level increases , as seen in several 3.6 cm flares .",
    "in contrast with polarization levels at other frequencies , the 20 cm polarizations are negative , or left circularly polarized during these flares . figure  [ radioflare3 ] shows two examples of 20 cm flares .",
    "this reversal of sense of polarization , or helicity , was pointed out by @xcite as evidence of coherent bursts of radiation : an emitting mechanism distinct from incoherent gyrosynchrotron emission at higher frequencies , which generally keeps the same sense of polarization .",
    "such highly polarized bursts are a relatively common phenomenon on dme flare stars @xcite , and have been interpreted as either emission at the plasma frequency or its harmonics , or radiation from an electron cyclotron maser instability , generally occurring at the cyclotron frequency or its harmonics @xcite .",
    "a glance at the polarization light curves ( figures  [ 1994radiopol ] ,  [ 1996radiopol ] , and  [ 1998radiopol ] ) reveals that for a large amount of the time when hr  1099 was observed at 20 cm , the emission was highly negatively circularly polarized .",
    "we estimated the fraction of time the system was exhibiting this behavior , by filtering the polarization data for times when the amount of circular polarization was less than -20% .",
    "roughly 30% of the time when hr  1099 was observed at 20 cm , the emission was characterized by moderate to large values of left circular polarization .",
    "the light curves are averages over typically several minutes , and larger variations on smaller timescales could be masked by averaging over large time bins .",
    "thus this is an estimate , but does point out the apparently common nature of such events on hr  1099 .",
    "we investigated the flare polarizations for these 20 cm flares in the same way as described above for 3.6 cm flares , by assuming a two - component model of a quiescent source and a flare source contributing to the total observed flux and polarization .",
    "in contrast to the 3.6 cm flares , a large amount of left circular polarization is necessary to reproduce the observed polarization variations during these flares .",
    "figure  [ radioflare3 ] shows the expected polarization variations if the flare is 100% lcp in red crosses and circles , which is consistent with the observed polarization levels .",
    "thus the total polarization can be described as an equal admixture of quiescent polarization at a few percent rcp and 100% left circularly polarized flare emission .",
    "this behavior is consistent with expected coherent emission , which should be 100% circularly polarized if it is fundamental plasma emission .",
    "we examined the light curves of flux and polarization changes in figures  [ 1993radioflux ] through  [ 1998radiopol ] to determine if there was a significant degree of correlation between flares at 20 cm and those at higher frequencies , which are generally attributed to gyrosynchrotron flares .",
    "we use a relatively lenient restriction , looking for a close temporal association ( within @xmath21 1 day ) between 3.6 cm flares and either an increase in flux or significant amounts of left circularly polarized emission at 20 cm .",
    "table  [ tbl:20cm3cmtbl ] details the 20 cm and 3.6 cm behavior .",
    "there is a low correlation between 3.6 cm flares and 20 cm flux@xmath9polarization enhancements ; only 3 out of the 12 events show a 3.6 cm flare during the same @xmath1 17 hours of each day where radio coverage at both frequencies was obtained .",
    "there are a much larger number of bursts at 20 cm than at 3.6 cm .",
    "the atca observations at 13 cm also exhibit some of the same behavior as seen at 20 cm : highly polarized , short duration enhancements .",
    "there are two cases with negative circular polarization at 6 cm , 1996 september 34 and 1998 september 89 .",
    "the 6 cm data are not simultaneous with the 13/20 cm recordings , but both 6 cm events are accompanied by highly polarized flares at 13 and 20 cm .",
    "since the atca data offer simultaneous 13 and 20 cm coverage with the same time binning and resolution , we examined correlations between polarizations at these two frequencies .",
    "the time binning is rather coarse for investigating what presumably are short duration bursts ; the bins are @xmath1 15 minutes full width and separated by about 30 minutes .",
    "there are only two occasions where the 13 cm lcp emission is accompanied by corresponding lcp 20 cm emission  1994 august 2425 and 1996 september 34 . in the former ,",
    "the 13 cm emission is left circularly polarized for only @xmath21 2 hours , whereas the 20 cm data shows lcp for @xmath21 7 hours .",
    "the 20 cm flux peaks earlier than the 13 cm flux and is declining from maximum when the 13 cm flux is increasing to its maximum flux .",
    "the 20 cm data reaches its maximum negative left circular polarization when the 20 cm flux peaks , and likewise with the 13 cm lcp and flux .",
    "the percent of 20 cm lcp emission is much larger at its peak than the peak of the 13 cm percent lcp emission by about a factor of three .",
    "this behavior , with a temporal difference in peak flux and polarization between 13 and 20 cm , could be attributed to a frequency drift in coherent emission between these two frequencies , but the frequency difference ( @xmath42 988 mhz ) and temporal difference between flux peaks ( @xmath43 8400 seconds ) leads to a frequency drift rate of @xmath210.12 mhz s@xmath17 , which is about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than frequency drift rates seen in solar phenomena ( and deduced from dme flare star bursts ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus the behavior in the two frequency bands are probably not related .",
    "the second period of lcp emission at both 13 and 20 cm is 1996 september 34 . here",
    "the behavior is more complicated .",
    "there is a close association in the flux evolution at the two frequencies , but the variation of the circular polarization shows no apparent correlation .",
    "the 13 cm and 20 cm circular polarizations are changing rapidly with time in the half hour between each subsequent scan , suggesting that much finer temporal variations are taking place . with such coarse time binning it is difficult to say whether the lcp behavior at 20 cm is related to the 13 cm behavior .",
    "we note , however , that there are many more instances of highly left circularly polarized behavior at 20 cm , which implies that it is a separate phenomenon from the lcp emission at 13 cm , although we can not rule out a causal relationship .",
    "there is also 6 cm emission that is left circularly polarized during the general time of 13/20 cm bursts  it is consistent with quiescent emission just before and after the burst , and a 5080% left circularly polarized burst component .    for time periods when the 20 cm light curves show highly lcp emission , we investigated trends in ll and rr flux with time .",
    "we found in most cases that temporal resolution at the 10 second level , the time sampling of the vla data , was necessary to determine the detailed flux variations ; sampling on even shorter timescales might be necessary , although unobtainable with this dataset .",
    "figure  [ coherent ] illustrates several cases of both long and short duration , highly polarized bursts .",
    "there are rises and decays which last less than one minute , along with a complex morphology that might indicate a long series of multiple overlapping bursts , each occurring on timescales less than 10 seconds .",
    "for all these bursts , the lcp flux dominates over the rcp flux , indicating negatively circularly polarized emission .",
    "in contrast to the lcp flux , which shows great variations , the rcp flux is remarkably constant .",
    "we also investigated the difference in temporal evolution of the flux at the two intermediate frequency ( if ) bands used in continuum mode observing at 20 cm : 14401490 and 13601410 mhz in 1994 august .",
    "the bottom two panels of figure  [ coherent ] detail two different kinds of behavior . in the first case , both if bands show similar evolution ; and in the second , the flux patterns change with time and frequency .",
    "this latter case is different from what was observed by @xcite where the lcp flux in the two sidebands was equal and varying in the same way .",
    "we investigated the trends of flux and polarization with frequency for the multi - frequency radio datasets . while the frequency coverage is not strictly simultaneous due to frequency switching or combining coverage with the vla and atca , we can obtain contemporaneous multi - frequency coverage of up to five frequencies spanning an order of magnitude in frequency to within about a half an hour . during periods where there is no obvious flaring at any wavelengths ,",
    "such time intervals should be small enough to record the general characteristics of the quiescent radio emission .",
    "problems arise , however , when variability is present at one or more frequencies , and then we can only diagnose some `` average '' conditions which may or may not represent the actual conditions .",
    "we concentrate on time intervals when 2 cm observations occurred , to extend the frequency coverage , although for the 1993 observations no recordings at 2 cm were obtained .",
    "we extracted flux and polarization information from the light curve data for each frequency that was close enough in time to provide adequate temporal and frequency coverage , generally within about 30 minutes of the 2 cm observation .",
    "spectral indices were computed for each successive frequency pair ; the spectral index @xmath24 ( where s@xmath44 ) is computed using a least - squares linear fit to the logarithmic flux and frequency data , and are listed in table  [ tbl : specindex ] . we have sorted the time intervals according to the general light curve behavior the system was exhibiting : either quiescent behavior or the peak@xmath9decay of a 3.6 cm flare .",
    "figure  [ fig : radiospec ] displays the flux and polarization spectra typical for these activity levels .    for all the intervals where flux and polarization spectra could be determined , the polarization shows an increasing trend with frequency , regardless of the behavior of the flux spectra .",
    "the characteristics of the flux spectra are consistent with previously determined behavior on active binary systems .",
    "the quiescent data generally show a decline in flux with increasing frequency .",
    "the indices for quiescent observations are flat or slightly negative , @xmath45 , with an exception being 1998 sept . 10.3 , which has a 3.62 cm spectral index of @xmath46 .",
    "this declining trend of flux with frequency suggests that the emission is optically thin .",
    "the increase in observed circular polarization with frequency is in contrast to the expected behavior of optically thin nonthermal gyrosynchrotron radiation from a homogeneous source ; however , it is difficult to obtain large values of percent circular polarization under optically thick conditions @xcite .",
    "@xcite have found similar evidence for a rising polarization spectrum with frequency being independent of the flux spectrum shape for a sample of active binary systems .",
    "several flares at 3.6 cm show corresponding intensity variations at 6 cm , and we investigated these flares for changes in the spectral index @xmath47 during the course of the flare .",
    "figure  [ radioflare ] shows the results for three moderate - sized flares . in general , there is a positive , linear correlation between the flux and spectral index",
    "this is in accord with the general trends noted by @xcite between the spectral index and luminosity for a sample of active binary systems . during the rise to peak intensity ,",
    "the spectral index flattens , becoming less negative , even changing sign and becoming increasingly positive for two cases ( 1994 august 26.5 and 1996 september 7.35 ) .",
    "this may signal a change to optically thick emission at the flare peak , and would explain the apparent zero polarization level of the flare , in combination with a positive amount of quiescent circular polarization .",
    "the shift from optically thin to optically thick conditions at the flare peak , and return afterwards , implies that the peak frequency @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 ) is @xmath27 8.3 ghz during the flare rise and peak , and @xmath23 5 ghz during the flare decay .      @xcite discuss the analysis of the 1993 _ iue _ observations and 1993 _ hst / ghrs _ observations .",

    "during the fourth observation , in 1998 , hr  1099 was relatively inactive , signalling an abrupt change in activity level .",
    "we also attempted to quantify and compare the activity of the system by examining the average non - flaring count rate during the four observations . determining the actual quiescent level of the system is somewhat difficult , due to the obvious influence of large flares in the light curve .",
    "the quiescent , or non - flaring level , might also be affected by rotational modulation of starspots or numerous small - scale flares which occur too close together in time to resolve with _ euve _ s poor orbital efficiency .",

    ", pre - flare heating and brightening is due to slow rearrangement of the magnetic field and subsequent slow energy release before the impulsive energy release that marks the flare , although not all solar flares exhibit this behavior .",

    "the flare which peaked on 1994 august 24.2 and that which peaked on 1996 september 5.3 are asymmetrical in the sense that the rise happens very quickly but the decay is long .",
    "the two asymmetric flares are remarkably similar as well , when shifted and scaled ( see figure  [ composite_flare ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "the general characteristics of most flares seen here show marked departures from the `` canonical '' flare shape  a fast rise followed by a slow decay .",
    "for many of these euv flares , the evolution of the flare rise and decay is at the same rate .",
    "only two flares appear to show a fast rise and slow decay . in the solar scenario ,",
    "the energy release , particle acceleration and heating of lower atmosphere plasma to coronal temperatures and subsequent ablation into coronal loops happens quickly ( apart from a possible pre - flare cursor ; see above ) ; this is the impulsive phase .",
    "perhaps the symmetry between rise and decay in flares seen on active binary systems reflects the nature of the energy release , which happens on longer timescales ( gradual instead of explosive evaporation ) or in a larger arcade of loops .",
    "if multiple loops were involved in producing the flare we see in the light curve , then the slow rise could be interpreted as progressive brightenings as subsequent coronal loops become filled with coronal plasma and radiate . at what we identify as the peak of the flare , the maximum number of loops is filled , or the largest loops in a size distribution of loops are filled with coronal plasma , the radiation reaches a peak and the plasma cools via radiation and conduction ( and possibly continued heating ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to a decline in flux .",

    "as described in  3.5 , the goal of this paper is to investigate flares on a case - by - case basis .",
    "based on our analysis of the light curves in  4.3.1 , we identified temporal intervals corresponding to quiescence and flares , and marked those for subsequent spectral extraction .",
    "figure  [ euvelc ] shows the light curves and corresponding time intervals in which spectra were accumulated ; ` q ' refers to quiescent times , ` f ' to flare times ( often several small - amplitude flares ) , and ` f1 ' , ` f2 ' , etc . to discrete large - amplitude flares .",

    "figures  [ euveswspec ] and  [ euvemwspec ] display the sw and mw spectra for these time intervals , with selected emission lines identified .",
    "the spectra are dominated by lines of highly ionized iron  ionization stages xv  xxiv . in spite of the dramatic changes illustrated by the light curves , the corresponding spectral changes are less overwhelming .",
    "the most noticeable increases that occur during flare segments compared to quiescent segments are enhancements in the flux from the fe  xxiii@xmath9xx @xmath58 132.85 and fe  xxiv @xmath59 192.02 , 255.09 .",
    "other lines appear to be at the same flux level .",
    "due to the low sensitivity of the _ euve _ spectrometers , the flare spectra have not had any estimate of quiescent flux subtracted , and thus represent a combination of flare and quiescent plasma .",
    "the assumptions we make in analyzing the spectra are that the emission is from a collisionally ionized plasma , in equilibrium , and effectively thin . under such circumstances ,",
    "the plasma is in a steady state between collisional ionization and radiative and dielectronic recombination ; line formation is a balance between collisional excitation and radiative de - excitation .",
    "the effectively thin assumption implies that all the emitted photons escape ; some ( typically @xmath60 ) are directed outward toward the observer and some are directed inward , possibly to the stellar surface ( depending on the geometry ) .",
    "the observed flux can be written as a product of the elemental abundance times an integral involving the plasma emissivity and the differential emission measure : + @xmath61 where a is the elemental abundance , p@xmath62 is the plasma emissivity .",
    "the quantity + @xmath63 is the differential emission measure ( dem ) , or the emission measure ( em ) differential in temperature , + @xmath64 bright lines of iron dominate the spectrum and span a relatively wide temperature range ( from fe  xv at 2 mk to fe  xxiv at 20 mk ) ; for these reasons we use these lines to constrain the shape of the coronal differential emission measure distribution .",
    "since the dem thus determined is relative to the coronal abundance of iron , this eliminates the necessity of determining the iron abundance simultaneously with the dem .",
    "previous studies that have attempted to constrain both these quantities have found that generally two classes of results match the data statistically : a dem with a peak between 1 and 30 mk with subsolar iron abundances , or a solar abundance plasma with a marked peak at 100 mk @xcite . restricting the dem determination by only using iron lines",
    "removes some of this ambiguity .",
    "we measured emission line fluxes of lines in the sw and mw spectra by generating a linelist from the plasma emissivities taken from @xcite and assuming a gaussian line profile .",
    "these emissivities have been calculated in the low density limit , and agree with those of @xcite in their low density limit .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the line profiles were fixed at the instrumental resolution : 0.38   for sw and 1.14   for mw .",
    "we corrected for the effects of interstellar absorption in the sw and mw spectra by using photoabsorption cross section calculations of @xcite and a hydrogen column density of 1.35 10@xmath65 @xmath41 as derived by @xcite .",
    "the analysis of _ euve _ spectral data is complicated by the presence of continuum emission . although present only at a low flux level , the continuum flux rises to shorter wavelengths , and can introduce errors in determining the fluxes of emission lines .",
    "pinning down the level of continuum emission requires having line - free regions of the spectrum .",
    "the euv spectral region is littered with numerous weak emission lines in the atomic codes , and the incompleteness of the codes in this region is a recognized problem @xcite .",
    "an added complication is the formation of the continuum flux at temperatures higher than those diagnosed with the emission lines present in the _ euve _ spectrum .",
    "previous studies of stellar coronae in x - rays have revealed coronal elemental abundances that are less than solar ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and appear to vary during flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this leads to an increased amount of continuum emission , because the dem here is computed relative to the iron abundance .",
    "decreasing the iron abundance necessitates raising the dem by the same amount so that the predicted line flux does not change : a larger dem consequently produces more continuum flux .",
    "we investigated the effect of sub - solar iron abundances in the spectrum .",
    "we performed an initial analysis of the data assuming that the abundance was equal to the solar photospheric abundances of @xcite , the minimum amount of continuum that might exist in the spectrum , and using the method described below to generate the dem .",
    "we then predicted what the level of the continuum spectrum should be based on abundances ranging from solar to one tenth the solar photospheric abundance of iron .",
    "figure  [ contfig ] shows the sw composite quiescent and flare spectra and continuum spectra overlaid .",
    "the spectra have been corrected for the effect of interstellar absorption .",

    "the discrepancy between line fluxes determined with no continuum subtraction and a continuum calculated assuming very sub - solar abundances grows larger with decreasing abundance",

    "* 1998q * ) and a flare interval ( * 1994f * ) , the difference in emission line flux introduced by not subtracting a continuum compared with assuming a continuum with iron abundance @xmath270.4 was at the same level as the photometric errors .",
    "this is a different result from that obtained for the composite spectra ( where fe / h @xmath150.2 solar ) , due mostly to s / n issues . in the following analysis of the _ euve _ data , which uses the lower s / n spectra to examine activity - related spectral changes , we take the coronal iron abundance of hr  1099 to be 0.4 for all time segments , thus assuming the iron abundance does not vary during flares",
    "this is a conservative estimate based on the fluxes in short time interval spectra : the _ euve _ data can only constrain fe / h to be @xmath15 0.2 .",
    "the dem was determined from the emission lines of iron , as described above ; initially no continuum flux was subtracted before measuring emission lines .",
    "once the dem was constrained , a continuum was predicted using the dem and an iron to hydrogen ratio of 0.4 times the solar photospheric value as given in @xcite and subtracted from the observed spectrum .",
    "the emission lines were re - fitted , and the dem was redetermined .",
    "the method for constraining the dem is an interactive one ; the user chooses a value of the dem at each temperature bin ( @xmath66 , from @xmath67=6.27.5 ) , and adjusts the value of the dem at each temperature bin until there is suitable agreement between observed line fluxes and those predicted by the dem .",
    "because plasma emissivities in the low density limit are used , any line exhibiting a departure from collisional ionization equilibrium was not used to constrain the dem . for temporal intervals where lines of fe  xv , xvi were not detected",

    "despite the limited coverage of any given flare with the suite of telescopes employed in these campaigns , we still can investigate rough statistics of correlation in the radio , uv , euv , and sxr bands .",

    "there were a total of ten 3.6 cm radio flares : five were associated with euv / sxr flares , while two had euv / sxr coverage but there was no rise in high energy thermal flux .",
    "the start of the rise phase in euv@xmath9sxr flares is generally when the impulsive uv and 3.6 cm radio flares occur , as demonstrated in figures  [ 1993multiw ] , [ 1994multiw2 ] , [ 1994multiw1 ] .",
    "the uv and radio radiation show a sudden increase then decay at this point .",
    "the radio emission originates from gyrosynchrotron emission from accelerated particles ; the abrupt change in behavior suggests an increase in the number of radiating particles , increase of magnetic field strength , or possibly a change in the distribution of the nonthermal electrons .",
    "the correlation of uv flux with radio flux suggests that the transition region ( c  iv ) and sometimes the chromosphere ( mg  ii ) are heated by nonthermal particles impinging from the corona .",
    "the trend of mg  ii fluxes with radio emission is less clear . for the euv flare that peaked on 1993 september 17.4 , both c  iv and mg  ii showed a peak during the rise of the euv flare . in subsequent euv@xmath9sxr flares , however , there was no response from mg  ii , in contrast to the behavior illustrated by c  iv .",
    "radio variability is more common at 20 cm than at higher frequencies .",
    "section 4.2 showed that negatively polarized bursting behavior at 20 cm happened about 30% of the time hr  1099 was observed .",
    "figures  [ 1994multiw2 ] ,  [ 1996multiw1 ] ,  [ 1998multiw1 ] compare the flux and polarization behavior at 20 cm to the variations of the thermal plasma in the euv and sxr .",
    "one might expect a higher association rate between 20 cm bursts and euv / sxr flares , since both appear to occur frequently .",
    "such an assessment is difficult to make , due partly to the gaps in time coverage between the two wavelength regions , and the lack of any structured behavior at 20 cm , compared to the more or less orderly rise and decay of the largest euv / sxr flares .",
    "there are several instances when the 20 cm radio flux appears to maintain a large value of lcp for several hours : 1994 august 24.725.0 , 1994 august 27.427.7 , 1996 september 3.33.9 , 1998 september 8.8.38.9 , 1998",
    "september 10.510.7 , and 1998 september 11.411.7 . at these times there are few euv flares , but also many gaps in euv coverage , so it is difficult to determine the association rate .",
    "the dem distributions for the thermal euv@xmath9sxr emission generally has two peaks , one at 68 mk ( 0.5 kev ) and the other at 2030 mk ( 1.72.6 kev ) . if we make the assumption that the extent of the 3.6 cm gyrosynchrotron radio emission during these flares is about the size of the primary , as found by @xcite during a strong radio flare ( @xmath870.9 mas ) , we can estimate the brightness temperature and energy of the electrons producing the gyrosynchrotron radiation . for the four euv@xmath9sxr flares accompanied by 3.6 cm radio bursts , the peak radio fluxes imply electron energies between 70 and 200 kev , well above the energies of the thermal electrons .",
    "these electron energies are accessible with the hard x - ray telescopes on board _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ , but no detectable hard x - ray emission was seen by either satellite .",
    "the 3.6 , 6 , and 20 cm bands have the most extensive overlap of the five frequencies used in our radio observations .",
    "generally , flares are most obvious at 3.6 and 20 cm .",
    "often , variations at 3.6 cm are repeated by variations at 6 cm , but the bandwidth does not generally extend to 20 cm .",
    "emission at 3.6 and 6 cm is consistent with gyrosynchrotron emission , which is expected to be relatively broadband : the approximate expressions in @xcite cover an order of magnitude range in harmonic number @xmath88 of the electron gyrofrequency .",
    "thus , one would expect to be able to observe gyrosynchrotron emission from a homogeneous source at both 3.6 and 20 cm .",
    "nondetection of flaring emission at 20 cm could be due to opacity effects , if the emission were optically thick , or due to a cutoff in the emission due to a high ambient density in the flaring region .",
    "alternatively , the lack of correlation between flaring at these two frequencies could be due to a different emission mechanism operating at lower frequencies .",
    "the persistent nature of gyrosynchrotron emission from accelerated particles in active binaries in a steady state is puzzling , and investigations have attempted to explain the observed patterns of flux and polarization with various models . @xcite attempted to explain the quiescent radio emission as the long - timescale decay of flares , ( episodic acceleration of electrons ) , in a dipolar magnetic field configuration .",
    "they followed the change in time of the flux spectrum due to decay of a flare , including collisional and radiative losses of an initially power - law distribution of electrons .",
    "the spectrum at the time of peak flux had a positive slope from 15 ghz , becoming negative for larger frequencies .",
    "as losses changed the shape of the electron distribution with energy , the spectrum evolved to a decreasing function of frequency from 130 ghz .",
    "a three - dimensional dipole field was applied by @xcite , who calculated both the flux and polarization spectra resulting from gyrosynchrotron radiation .",
    "@xcite found it difficult to reconcile the flat flux spectrum with a changing polarization spectrum .",
    "their geometry was a thin shell of radiating electrons of width @xmath21 0.1 r@xmath89 at 1.92 r@xmath89 in an arcade of magnetic loops , with a continuous injection of accelerated particles to maintain the electron distribution against radiative losses . in order to produce a flat flux spectrum ,",
    "as was observed from their quiescent data , the nonthermal electron density must increase with radius .",
    "@xcite examined the vla and atca observations from 1993 and 1994 also presented here .",
    "they interpreted the data in light of the 3d model presented in @xcite .",
    "they argue that the increasing trend of polarization with frequency is indicative of a change from optically thick gyrosynchrotron emission at low frequencies to optically thin radiation at high frequencies .",
    "however , @xcite note in their observations of active binaries that the increasing trend of polarization with frequency is independent of the shape of the flux spectrum , contrary to the expectations from homogeneous sources @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : radiospec ] displays examples of flux and polarization spectra during the decays of high frequency radio flares .",
    "the flux spectrum is increasing at low frequencies , but turns over at higher frequencies , with a maximum between 2 and 5 ghz .",
    "this behavior is consistent with optically thick emission at low frequencies and optically thin conditions at high frequencies , a pattern that has been seen during the rise and peak of flares on other active binaries @xcite . in the limits of small and large optical depth ,",
    "the frequency dependence of the effective temperature and absorption coefficient can be combined to estimate the range of spectral indices @xmath24 between flux measurements at adjacent frequencies . for a homogeneous source in a vacuum ,",
    "the spectral index @xmath24 should depend on the power - law index of the electron distribution function , @xmath90 , as @xcite : + @xmath91 the spectral indices listed in table  [ tbl : specindex ] in the 15 ghz range are generally flatter than these limits on the spectral index , implying that a shallower distribution is required ( @xmath92 2 , and out of the range of validity of the formulae in @xcite ) , the source is inhomogeneous , or the magnetic field varies spatially .",
    "@xcite used a similar method as @xcite to model the flux spectrum , but examined the rising phase of flares , and determined that a continuous supply of relativistic electrons and loss mechanisms was necessary .",
    "the radio flares at 3.6 and 20 cm generally have quite different characteristics : 20 cm bursts are very highly polarized , and display rapid flux changes ( @xmath2360 s ) , while 3.6 cm bursts vary over longer timescales , and are consistent with little to no intrinsic polarization .",
    "this suggests a different mechanism at 20 cm , bringing us to the question of what kind of process might be operating to produce the 20 cm flares .",
    "the quantities necessary to discriminate different radio emission mechanisms are : ( 1 ) time duration of the event ; ( 2 ) brightness temperature t@xmath93 ; ( 3 ) sense and amount of circular polarization ; ( 4 ) bandwidth @xmath94 .",
    "the time duration is limited by the temporal sampling of the vla data to be @xmath15 10 seconds .",
    "there are large lcp fluxes that persist for long timescales , @xmath1 5.6 hours , as well as fluctuations on smaller timescales",
    ". often increases , peaks , and declines in flux were observed to occur with a duration @xmath0 60 seconds .",
    "knowledge of the brightness temperature involves an estimate of the emitting source size , which we can not unambiguously deduce from these data .",
    "we can place a lower limit on t@xmath93 by assuming that the radio source is @xmath1 the size of the binary orbit : consistent with previous vlbi observations of quiescence in active binaries at higher frequencies @xcite , and constrained by a light travel time of @xmath21 60s ( the approximate duration of the shortest individual bursts ) .",
    "the brightness temperature can be determined from the observed flux s@xmath95 , at a wavelength of 20 cm , assuming a source size @xmath962.5 using orbital parameters from @xcite and references therein , + @xmath97 the brightness temperatures of the 20 cm bursts was in the range 14 10@xmath98 k , pointing to a nonthermal process , suggesting electron energies of a few tens of mev .",
    "the high degrees of circular polarization argue for a relatively localized phenomenon , so this is a lower limit to the brightness temperature .",
    "the observed circular polarizations are very large and negative and consistent with 100% lcp emission assuming a two - component quiescent and flaring model .",
    "the polarization at higher frequencies , where the spectral indices indicate optically thin conditions , suggests x - mode emission .",
    "since the low frequency emission has the opposite helicity , it appears to be o - mode emission , which is consistent with the hypothesis of plasma emission .",
    "o - mode plasma emission at the fundamental can be explained by the lower cut - off frequency for o - mode emission compared to x - mode @xcite ; polarizations can reach quite high levels .",
    "we can place rough limits on the bandwidth by comparing the behavior at 20 cm with that at 13 or 6 cm . from a lack of correlation with higher frequency data",
    ", the bandwidth must be smaller than @xmath1 988 mhz .",
    "the difference in flux behavior in the two intermediate frequencies of the vla l band receiver also constrains the bandwidth of the phenomenon .",
    "the two ifs span 50 mhz centered on 1385 and 1465 mhz respectively .",
    "the bottom two panels of figure  [ coherent ] compare the behavior in these two ifs during some 20 cm bursts . from 1994 august 27.52527.533 , the higher frequencies dominated in flux , although the temporal pattern of both ifs is similar , suggesting @xmath99 130 mhz .",
    "on 1994 august 28.37228.380 the lower if dominates in flux initially , followed by a change to higher frequency dominating at the end of the burst event , suggesting that the bandwidth was smaller than 130 mhz .",
    "the differential frequency information available in the two ifs from these continuum observations is not enough to pin down the bandwidth ; finer spectral binning must be used , such as available with the arecibo telescope , the green bank telescope , or the expanded vla .",
    "highly polarized , short time duration events have been observed on the sun , although generally at lower frequencies than seen here .",
    "the metric and decimetric solar radio bursting and spiky emission is usually attributed to plasma radiation at the fundamental or second harmonic of the plasma frequency ( @xmath100 , s@xmath1011,2 ) .",
    "this emission is associated with electron beams , and results from the conversion of electron beam - excited coronal plasma waves into plasma radiation .",
    "table  1 of @xcite summarizes the characteristics of solar radio bursts .",
    "some bursts display analogous behavior to that seen here .",
    "type  i bursts have brightness temperatures @xmath27 10@xmath98 k and are highly polarized in the sense of the o - mode .",
    "however , they tend to occur at much lower frequencies ( @xmath102 few hundred mhz ) , and can have very small bandwidths @xmath103 1 mhz and last for one second at most .",
    "solar radio continuum emissions have been observed which are relatively long - lived , highly polarized , and show large polarizations in the sense of the o - mode ; an example is type  iv storm continuum . @xcite",
    "have catalogued solar flare radio emission from 13 ghz , and give examples of type  iv bursts which last for minutes , modulated on timescales less than 10 seconds , and are strongly polarized .",
    "the two main mechanisms which have been proposed to explain similar behavior in dme flare stars are plasma radiation or emission from an electron - cyclotron maser instability .",
    "both interpretations suffer from uncertainties in the model parameters , and imprecise knowledge of stellar atmospheric structure .",
    "plasma emission can occur at the fundamental or second harmonic of the plasma frequency ( @xmath104 ) , while emission from an electron cyclotron maser instability generally occurs at the fundamental or harmonics of the electron cyclotron frequency ( @xmath105 mhz ) .",
    "these parameters depend on the electron density @xmath106 and magnetic field strength @xmath107 , whose variation with height ( for the case of a homogeneous , stratified atmosphere ) or relative changes in inhomogeneous structures are not known .",
    "often only a single coronal electron density or photospheric magnetic field strength measurement exists ; it is difficult to infer whether spatial regimes in the stellar upper atmosphere favoring either mechanism exist .",
    "additional complicating factors include the propagation and escape of the radiation once it has been generated : for example , o - mode plasma emission at the fundamental frequency can explain the large values of percent left circular polarization , but this radiation experiences strong free - free absorption due to the high inferred electron densities .",
    "similarly , fundamental radiation from electron - cyclotron maser emission experiences large amounts of gyroresonant absorption , due to the high inferred magnetic field strengths .",
    "a coronal loop provides a natural set - up for a magnetic mirror and resulting loss - cone distribution ; however , recent research on auroral kilometric radiation ( akr ) which invokes a cyclotron maser emission mechanism has shown that a shell maser configuration is more appropriate in this situation @xcite .",
    "a shell maser in a stellar corona would allow the source to be located higher in the corona due to a more moderate requirement of the magnetic mirror ratio .",
    "in addition to these two possibilites , @xcite has proposed some exotic mechanisms to explain the extremely high brightness temperature phenomena observed in dme flare star coronae .    without better temporal and frequency resolution",
    ", it is impossible to discriminate amongst these two coherent emission mechanisms in the observational data .",
    "the hours - long highly lcp emission could be an envelope of thousands of short duration bursts ( @xmath0 10 s ) overlapping each other , or it could be diffuse continuum emission .",
    "@xcite suggested the solar analogy of type  i noise storms @xcite to explain this phenomena : a superposition of type  i bursts with bandwidths of about 100 mhz is consistent with the data here .",
    "similarly , continuous pumping of free energy into the maser from a parallel electric field could explain the long duration of large negative polarization .",
    "the smaller timescale bursts could be due to pulses from the maser .",
    "the high coronal temperatures ( t@xmath15 10 mk ) found in hr  1099 and other active binary systems could reduce the free - free absorption that would result from fundamental plasma emission ( free - free absorption coefficient @xmath21 n@xmath108/t@xmath109 ) and explain the higher frequencies where the stellar emission is found , compared to the lower temperature solar corona .",
    "the evidence from high energy spectra for high coronal electron densities ( n@xmath110 10@xmath2 @xmath4 ) suggests there must be extreme density inhomogeneities , however ; otherwise the high inferred electron densities would obliterate any effect of high temperatures in reducing the free - free opacity .",
    "one of the requirements for generating the electron - cyclotron maser is the condition of a low density plasma , @xmath111 1 .",
    "we do not have exact knowledge of the spatial variations of the electron density or magnetic field in the coronal environment of hr  1099 .",
    "the situation is made more complicated by the presence of two stars , and possible intrabinary emission .",
    "we can make estimates for plausibility arguments . taking a base coronal electron density of 10@xmath2 @xmath4 ( see   [ sec : ch5euvespec ] ) , a base magnetic field of @xmath0 1000 g as determined from zeeman doppler imaging @xcite , and estimates for the density scale height and magnetic scale height using the parameters for the k1  iv primary , the plasma frequency always exceeds the electron gyrofrequency : + @xmath112 assuming @xmath113 and @xmath114 , for h@xmath115 h@xmath116 ; the density scale height h@xmath116 at 10@xmath13 k is 5.6 10@xmath117 cm , or approximately twice the radius of the k1 subgiant .",

    "abundances of other elements are similar in the _ asca _ and _ xmm - newton _ observation , but due to the differing wavelength coverage and sensitivity , the iron abundance is the more important to compare since in principle it can be determined more accurately . the large flare captured by the _ xmm - newton _ observation also revealed an enhancement in the iron abundance , about a factor of three compared to the quiescent value .",

    "the salient flares are those on 1994 august 25.76 , 1996 september 4.8 , 1998 september 7.9 , and 1998 september 9.8 .",
    "while the sxr light curves exhibit enhancements of 23 over the level outside of the flare , the euv light curve typically shows variations at the level of 2030% .",
    "this suggests that lower energy bandpasses will be insensitive to all but the most energetic flares .",
    "unfortunately , none of the large euv flares were observed in the sxr ; we expect the flare contrast would have been huge .    in @xcite the flare frequency",
    "was determined for a sample of active binary systems that were observed with _",
    "euve_. after consideration of the poor flare contrast in the euv , it is possible that those flare frequencies were underestimated .",
    "the most extreme example of this is illustrated by the _",
    "euve _ observations in 1998 .",
    "the light curve of euv variations in figure  [ euvelc ] shows only one moderate flare noticeable during an observation spanning 8.7 days .",
    "we noted in section  [ moreeuvlc ] that there was a sudden shift in activity from the behavior displayed in the 19931996 observations and that illustrated in 1998 .",
    "inspection of the _ bepposax _ and _ rxte _ light curves in figure  [ 1998multiw1 ] show that there are roughly five more flares , in addition to the one obvious in the _ euve _ light curve . based on the _ euve _ light curve ,",
    "we would have concluded that the flare frequency was @xmath21 0.1 day@xmath17 ; using the multi - wavelength light curves , we would infer a much higher rate , @xmath21 0.7 day@xmath17 .",
    "@xcite examined a sample of solar flares spanning four orders of magnitude in peak emission measure , and found an almost power - law dependence between the peak emission measure ( @xmath21 peak luminosity ) and the peak flare temperature , with a steep dependence ( em@xmath137t@xmath138 ) .",
    "@xcite extrapolated the results to a few of the largest stellar flares which had been reported in the literature .",
    "this relation implies that larger flares are also hotter , which would skew the flare spectral energy distribution to harder photon energies , and explain the apparent discrepancy between the _ euve _ flare enhancements and the _ rxte_/_bepposax _ flare enhancements .",
    "@xcite examined the flare rate distribution on the m dwarf flare star ad  leo using simultaneous _",
    "euve _ and _ bepposax _ lecs and mecs light curves in combination with model - flare - synthesized light curves generated assuming a power law distribution of flares with energy .",
    "they found a systematic flattening of the derived distributions generated using the harder energy mecs data , compared with the _ euve _ and lecs detector data .",
    "they interpreted this skewing as due to the harder energy range of the mecs detector , and the increasing peak temperatures of more luminous flares .",
    "the softer bandpasses are more sensitive to quiescent emission .",
    "such a statistical treatment of flare rate distributions will be less biased than simply counting individual large flares .",
    "harder x - ray bandpasses are more favorable , however , for investigating the temperatures involved in large stellar flares .",
    "there are several conclusions to be drawn from such a broad investigation of flaring on the active binary system hr  1099 .",
    "one of the surprising results obtained from radio observations is how common bursts at low frequencies are on hr  1099  occurring roughly one third of the time .",
    "we have investigated the nature of l - band bursts , and find that they are characterized by emission that can achieve large values of percent left circular polarization ( @xmath139 100% ) , is highly variable ( possibly varying on timescales less than the 10 second integration time of the vla observations ) and long - lasting ( attaining high flux levels and high degrees of left percent circular polarization for hours ) .",
    "due to an inability to constrain the source size of these bursts , only a moderate lower limit on the brightness temperature , t@xmath140 10@xmath98k , can be determined .",
    "such brightness temperatures could be consistent with incoherent gyrosynchrotron emission ; coupled with large values of circular polarization , short timescales and apparent lack of similarity with higher frequency variations , however , it is more likely that this phenomenon is an example of a coherent mechanism .",
    "determining what mechanism might be operating in the coronae of hr  1099 requires observations with better time resolution ( to constrain the source size ) , and larger frequency coverage ( to determine the bandwidth of the emission ) .    the characteristics of x - ray and microwave emission from active binary systems and dme stars share similarities .",
    "the thermal coronal emission from both is characterized by electron temperatures t@xmath128 of 530 mk , high densities ( n@xmath141 10@xmath2 @xmath4 ) , and coronal abundances that are subsolar in quiescence and appear to vary during flares .",
    "centimeter - wavelength radio emission is generally attributed to nonthermal gyrosynchrotron radiation outside of flares @xcite .",
    "the phenomena observed on hr  1099 at 20 cm reported here , and on other active binary systems reported by others , has parallels with behavior on dme stars : in both cases , there is evidence for highly polarized and time variable emission ( dme star behavior shows evidence for fast fluctuations [ @xmath142 20 milliseconds ] and extremely high brightness temperatues , [ @xmath143 10@xmath144k ] ) . constraining the observational properties of these low - frequency bursts on active binary systems will reveal the extent of the apparent similarity in dynamics of these two kinds of coronal environments .",
    "radio observations show several large flares at 3.6 cm .",
    "the increase of flux and decrease of polarization during 3.6 cm flares is consistent with a constant quiescent level in intensity and polarization and a flare which increases in flux but remains unpolarized .",
    "the 63.6 cm spectral indices during the flares show an increase during the flare rise , attaining the largest value as the flux reaches its maximum value ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this behavior is consistent with an increase in optical depth during the flare rise , and also consistent with little or no circular polarization during the flare ; it is difficult to obtain large values of circular polarization under optically thick conditions .",
    "the behavior of the radio flux spectra illustrate the general trends of active binary gyrosynchrotron emission : spectral indices are flat or slightly negative during quiescence , and show a peak between 2 and 5 ghz during flares .",
    "the observed polarizations always increase with frequency , regardless of the behavior of the flux spectra with frequency ( as also discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "there were no definite detections of hxr emission at energies larger than @xmath27 12 kev during or outside of flares . yet",
    "the radio fluxes indicate the existence ( and persistence ) of accelerated particles . to date",
    ", there have been only a few detections of hard x - ray ( 2050 kev ) emission by _ bepposax _ at the peak of very strong flares @xcite .",
    "this hxr emission however has been interpreted as thermal emission due to the very high temperatures ( t @xmath145 k ) reached in these flares .",
    "our _ bepposax _ pds observation of hr 1099 gives only an upper limit to hard x - ray emission which is two orders of magnitude lower than the soft x - ray emission .",
    "the fact that no hxr emission has been detected by either _",
    "rxte _ or _",
    "bepposax _ is due to the fact that the temperatures reached by the observed x - ray flares on hr  1099 are much lower than those needed ( about 100 mk ) for thermal hard x - ray emission ; and secondly , to the fact that the nonthermal electrons indicated by the radio observations are apparently insufficient to produce detectable non - thermal hard x - ray emission ( as is also true for the sun where the ratio of non - thermal to thermal hard x - ray emission in impulsive solar flares is @xmath15 10@xmath146 )",
    ".    flares lasting several days appear to be a common feature on active stars .",
    "such long - duration flares have now been detected not just on active binary systems @xcite , but on active evolved single giant stars @xcite as well as higher gravity dme flare stars @xcite .",
    "a feature common to many of these flares is the presence of a change in the light curve decay phase , from an initially fast decay to a slower decay .",
    "several flares on hr  1099 discussed in this paper also show evidence for such decay morphologies .",
    "unfortunately , the sensitivities of the euv and sxr telescopes which observed these flares are not sufficient to determine the change of plasma parameters ( n@xmath128 , t@xmath128 ) with time during the decay phase ; usually only a gross estimate of the total flare changes with respect to quiescent intervals is possible .",
    "this renders an interpretation of the underlying cause of the observed decay change difficult : a change to low - density structures during the late stages of the decay could explain the long decay timescales . another viable explanation is the presence of continued heating during the decay ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a possible clue may come from studying solar flares ; a few long - duration solar events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appear to possess a break during the decay , similar to the behavior seen in stellar long - duration events .",
    "_ euve _ observations reveal many flares ; hr  1099 was in a high state of activity for three out of the four years it was observed during these campaigns .",
    "there is suggestive evidence of a flare precursor in four large euv flares , consisting of a slow increase in flux before the flare rise .",
    "the dynamic range of events exhibited by hr  1099 was less than a factor of 7 in the euv .",
    "most flares in the euv show a remarkable amount of symmetry between the flare rise and decay , an observation that is at odds with the fast rise and slow decay typical of chromospheric evaporation in solar flares .",
    "an investigation of the time - resolved spectral variations confirms the creation of hot plasma during flare intervals .",
    "the existence of many weak lines blended with continuum radiation in the euv hinders spectral interpretation , particularly with regard to elemental abundances and activity - related abundance changes .",
    "this also limits the hottest temperatures to which euve spectra are sensitive .",
    "densities determined from _ euve _ spectra indicate high values ( n@xmath128 @xmath21 few 10@xmath2 @xmath4 ) during quiescence , but no evidence for a statistically significant enhancement during flares .",
    "_ asca _ observations of a small flare indicate an enhancement of the iron abundances by about a factor of three between quiescence and the peak of the flare .",
    "the emission measure distribution shows the same general structure during quiescence and flares : a peak at 610 mk and another between 20 and 30 mk . during flares ,",
    "the high temperature peak becomes more prominent and moves to hotter temperatures .",
    "the temperatures derived from _",
    "bepposax _ and _ asca _ spectra are generally consistent with each other ; however , the small flares observed with _ bepposax _ did not show any evidence for abundance changes . the behavior in different sxr bands as investigated with _ asca _ and _ rxte _ reveal faster changes at the harder energies , indicative of hotter temperature plasma .",
    "the multi - wavelength flare data illustrate fair correlation between euv@xmath9sxr flares and radio / uv bursts .",
    "this can be interpreted in the light of solar flare mechanisms using the neupert effect , where the time integral of the nonthermal radiation is proportional to the rise phase of the euv@xmath9sxr light curve .",
    "the correspondence of radio and uv light curves suggests that the uv line fluxes also can be used as a proxy for the the nonthermal radiation impinging on the chromosphere .",
    "three euv@xmath9sxr flares showed a radio burst during the flare rise , with time delays between peak radio and euv@xmath9sxr of 2.530 hours .",
    "these values are much larger than typical values for solar flares , where the delay is on the order of minutes .",
    "the highly polarized emission at 20 cm shows a low degree of correlation with gyrosynchrotron flaring activity at 3.6 cm .",
    "the ratios of flare luminosities in the euv and 3.6 cm bandpasses indicate a remarkable amount of similarity with ratios derived from simultaneous observations of quiescence in the two bandpasses .",
    "this suggests that a similar mechanism which forms the quiescent thermal / nonthermal radiation is also present , at some level , in producing the time - varying flare emission .",
    "the radio and euv flares considered here last orders of magnitude longer than typical solar flares , where nonthermal radio radiation lasts @xmath21 minutes , and euv / sxr thermal radiation lasts @xmath21 hours . yet , the ratios of euv - to - radio flare duration for the three flares discussed are in agreement with the solar and stellar flares discussed by @xcite .",
    "there is a noticeably greater enhancement in the flare luminosity compared with the quiescent luminosity for higher energy bandpasses . for times when euv and x - ray observations are simultaneous , often flares are obvious in the x - ray light curve but only appear as `` quiescent '' modulations in the euv .",
    "more luminous flares tend to be hotter , and thus the flare spectral energy distribution will be shifted to higher energies , and involve predominantly continuum emission ; flares will then favor the x - ray spectral regions over the euv .",
    "this can lead to a bias that lowers the observed flare frequency , and affects the distribution of flares with energy .",

    "<S> we report on four years of multiple wavelength observations of the rs  cvn system v711  tau ( hr  1099 ) from 1993 , 1994 , 1996 and 1998 . </S>",
    "<S> this combination of radio , ultraviolet ( uv ) , extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) , and x - ray observations allows us to view , in the most comprehensive manner currently possible , the coronal and upper atmospheric variability of this active binary system . </S>",
    "<S> we report on the changing activity state of the system as recorded in the euv and radio across the four years of observations , and study the high energy variability using an assemblage of x - ray telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> we find : + ( 1 ) evidence for coherent emission at low radio frequencies ( @xmath0 3 ghz ) which appears to be both highly time variable and persistent for several hours . </S>",
    "<S> such phenomena are relatively common , occurring @xmath1 30% of the time hr  1099 was observed at l - band . </S>",
    "<S> the measured polarizations of these bursts are left circularly polarized , in contrast with behavior at higher frequencies which has the opposite helicity . </S>",
    "<S> the polarizations are consistent with a variable source that is 100% left circularly polarized , along with a steady level of flux and polarization which is 0 or slightly right circularly polarized . </S>",
    "<S> there appears to be a low degree of correlation between bursts at 20 cm and higher frequency gyrosynchrotron flares , and also between 20 cm bursts and large euv / soft x - ray ( sxr ) outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 2 ) higher frequency ( 58 ghz ) flares show an inverse relationship between flux and polarization levels as the flare evolves ; this behavior is consistent with flare emission which is initially unpolarized . </S>",
    "<S> large variations in spectral index are observed , suggesting changes in optical depths of the flaring plasma as the burst progresses . </S>",
    "<S> quiescent polarization spectra show an increase of polarization with frequency , a pattern typically seen in active binary systems but still not understood </S>",
    "<S> . + ( 3 ) euv observations reveal several large flares , in addition to numerous smaller enhancements . </S>",
    "<S> the total range of variability as gleaned from light curve variations is only a factor of 7 , however . </S>",
    "<S> observations in different years provide evidence of a change in the quiescent , not obviously flaring , luminosity , by a factor of up to 2 . from an analysis of time - resolved spectral variations , we are able to infer evidence for the creation of high - temperature plasma during flare intervals compared with quiescent intervals . </S>",
    "<S> interpretation of euv spectral variations is hindered by the lack of ability to diagnose continuum levels and activity - related abundance changes , which are known from higher energy observations . </S>",
    "<S> electron densities determined by line ratios of density - sensitive emission lines are high ( 10@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 ) and there is no evidence for large density enhancements during flare intervals , compared with quiescent intervals . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 4 ) x - ray observations reveal several flares , and provide evidence of energy - dependent flare evolution : harder x - ray energies show faster temporal evolution than at softer energies . </S>",
    "<S> time - resolved x - ray spectral analysis shows the presence of hot plasma , t@xmath5 30 mk , during flares compared to quiescent intervals , as well as evidence for changing abundances during flares . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance of iron ( which is subsolar ) shows an enhancement of a factor of three at the peak of a moderate flare seen by _ asca _ relative to the pre - flare level ; abundances decrease during the flare decay . </S>",

    "<S> ( 5 ) the luminosity ratios l@xmath7/l@xmath8 in quiescence determined from several time intervals during the four campaigns are consistent with previously determined ratios from a sample of active stars and solar flares . </S>",
    "<S> the range of l@xmath7/l@xmath8 from three euv / radio ( 3.6 cm ) flares is the same as the values obtained during quiescence , which points to a common mechanism for producing both flaring and not flaring emission . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 6 ) seventeen flares were observed in the euv and@xmath9or sxr during the four campaigns ; of the eight flares that had radio coverage , three show 3.6 cm radio flares , which are generally consistent with the neupert effect . </S>",
    "<S> five euv@xmath9sxr flares had partial uv coverage ; all show uv responses , particularly in the c  iv transition . </S>",
    "<S> the uv flare enhancements can occur at the same time as the 3.6 cm radio flares , in two cases where radio , uv , and euv / sxr flare coverage overlapped . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 7 ) for sxr flares , we find that the contrast between flare emission and quiescent emission increases as expected towards higher energies , making flare detections easier at harder x - ray energies . this is due to the creation of high temperature plasma during flares , which shows up predominantly in high energy continuum emission . </S>",
    "<S> we find a discrepancy between the implied flaring rate based on euv observations , and higher energy observations ; the lower energies tend to miss many of the flares , due to the lack of sufficient contrast with quiescent emission . </S>"
