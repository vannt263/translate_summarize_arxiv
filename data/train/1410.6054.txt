    "in @xcite , church , ellenberg , and farb studied representations of the category @xmath0 , consisting of finite sets with injective maps , and found numerous applications to topology and algebra . in @xcite , we studied representations of the closely related category @xmath1 ( in addition to many other examples ) , where @xmath2 is the category of finite sets with surjective maps , and also found several applications ( e.g. , to the lannes  schwartz artinian conjecture and to @xmath3-modules ) . in this paper , we study generalizations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in which a group @xmath4 has been added to the mix .",
    "our main tool is the theory developed in @xcite ; in fact , the example @xmath5 was a primary source of motivation for that paper . in the rest of the introduction",
    ", we summarize our motivations and results .",
    "let @xmath4 be a group .",
    "a * @xmath4-map * between finite sets @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a pair @xmath8 consisting of functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 and @xmath12 are two @xmath4-maps , their composition @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( the product taken in @xmath4 ) .",
    "we let @xmath16 be the category whose objects are finite sets and whose morphisms are @xmath4-maps .",
    "we let @xmath17 ( resp .",
    "@xmath18 ) be the subcategory where the function @xmath19 is injective ( resp .",
    "surjective ) .",
    "we note that the automorphism group of the set @xmath20=\\{1 , \\ldots , n\\}$ ] in any of these categories is the wreath product @xmath21 .",
    "thus a representation of any of these categories can be thought of as a sequence @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a representation of @xmath21 , equipped with certain transition maps between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "( the kind of transition maps depends on the category . )",
    "these representations are the subject of this paper .",
    "a @xmath4-map @xmath25 is the same as a @xmath4-equivariant map @xmath26 .",
    "thus @xmath16 is equivalent to the category whose objects are free @xmath4-sets with finitely many orbits , and whose morphisms are @xmath4-equivariant functions .      usually , noetherianity is the first property one wants to establish about the representation theory of a category .",
    "( see  [ ss : rep ] for the definition of `` noetherian '' in this context . ) for @xmath0 , this was proved in @xcite , in varying levels of generality .",
    "our main result about @xmath17 characterizes when representations are noetherian :    [ mainthm : fi1 ] let @xmath27 be a ring",
    ". then @xmath28 is noetherian if and only if the group algebra @xmath29 $ ] is left - noetherian for all @xmath30 .",
    "recall that a group @xmath4 is * polycyclic * if it has a finite composition series @xmath31 such that @xmath32 is cyclic for @xmath33 , and it is * polycyclic - by - finite * ( or * virtually polycyclic * ) if it contains a polycyclic subgroup of finite index",
    ". it is known ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , lemma 3 ) that the group ring of a polycyclic - by - finite group over a left - noetherian ring is left - noetherian ( there it is stated for the integral group ring , but the proof works for any left - noetherian coefficient ring ) .",
    "in fact , there are no other known examples of noetherian group algebras , but see @xcite for related results . since a finite product of polycyclic - by - finite groups is again polycyclic - by - finite , the above theorem gives :    [ cor : polycyclic ] let @xmath4 be a polycyclic - by - finite group and let @xmath27 be a left - noetherian ring .",
    "then @xmath28 is noetherian .    when @xmath4 is a finite group , we prove a stronger result :    [ mainthm : fi2 ] if @xmath4 is finite then the category @xmath17 is quasi - grbner .",
    "`` quasi - grbner '' is a purely combinatorial condition on a category , introduced in @xcite ( and recalled in  [ ss : rep ] below ) , that implies noetherianity of the representation category .",
    "thus theorem  [ mainthm : fi2 ] implies theorem  [ mainthm : fi1 ] when @xmath4 is finite , as stated .",
    "however , quasi - grbner gives more than just noetherianity : it implies that representations admit a theory of grbner bases , in an appropriate sense , and thus computations with representations can be carried out algorithmically ( at least in principle ) .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ mainthm : fi2 ] is an easy consequence of the theory developed in @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ mainthm : fi1 ] is more involved .",
    "the key input is the fact that @xmath34 is noetherian whenever @xmath35 is left - noetherian .",
    "this is applied with @xmath36 $ ] , so even if one only cares about theorem  [ mainthm : fi1 ] when @xmath27 is a field , the proof uses @xmath0-modules over non - commutative rings .",
    "in fact , this is the first real application of @xmath0-modules over non - commutative rings that we know of .",
    "there is one additional result on @xmath17-modules worth mentioning :    [ mainthm : fi3 ] suppose that @xmath4 is finite and @xmath27 is a splitting field for @xmath4 in which the order of @xmath4 is invertible",
    ". then representations of @xmath17 are equivalent to representations of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the number of non - trivial irreducible representations of @xmath4 over @xmath27 .    here",
    "@xmath39 is the groupoid of finite sets , i.e. , the category of finite sets with bijections as morphisms .",
    "thus , in the context of the theorem , the theory of @xmath17-modules reduces to the theory of @xmath0-modules .",
    "we only study @xmath18 when @xmath4 is a finite group .",
    "the first result is about noetherianity , and is an easy consequence of the theory of @xcite :    [ mainthm : fs1 ] if @xmath4 is finite then @xmath5 is quasi - grbner . in particular , if @xmath27 is left - noetherian , then @xmath40 is noetherian .",
    "we next turn to hilbert series .",
    "suppose that @xmath41 is an @xmath5-module over a field @xmath27 , and suppose that @xmath4 has @xmath38 irreducible representations over @xmath27 .",
    "we define a formal power series @xmath42 , called the * hilbert series * of @xmath41 , that records the class of @xmath43)$ ] in the representation ring of @xmath44 for all @xmath30 .",
    "our main result is a rationality result for this series .",
    "the strongest and most general result takes some preparation to state , so we confine ourselves to the following simplified form here ( which is a special case of theorem  [ fsghilb ] ) :    [ mainthm : fs2 ] let @xmath41 be a finitely generated representation of @xmath5 over an algebraically closed field @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath45 be the exponent of the group @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath46 can be written in the form @xmath47 , where @xmath19 and @xmath48 are polynomials in the @xmath49 with coefficients in @xmath50 , and @xmath48 factors over @xmath51 as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a @xmath54$]-linear combination of the @xmath49 .",
    "( and @xmath55 is a primitive @xmath45th root of unity . )    to paraphrase : if @xmath41 is a finitely generated @xmath5-module then the representations @xmath43)$ ] of @xmath44 satisfy recursive relations of a very particular form .",
    "we show this by connecting these hilbert series for the generating functions of `` quasi - ordered languages '' which we introduce in this paper . to give a sense of how this connects to our previous paper @xcite : there we showed that finitely generated @xmath56-representations have hilbert series similar to those of @xmath57 , except with @xmath58 in place of @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the difference is that such hilbert series are controlled by `` ordered languages '' , and quasi - ordered languages are built from these with additional congruence conditions , which is why roots of unity appear .",
    "this is by far the deepest result of the paper , and much of our work goes into its proof .",
    "the idea is to first use brauer s theorem to reduce to the case where @xmath4 is a cyclic group whose order is invertible in @xmath27 .",
    "representations of @xmath4 are identified with vector spaces graded by the character group @xmath59 of @xmath4 , and , in a similar fashion , representations of @xmath5 with those of @xmath60 , a certain category whose objects are finite sets in which each element is weighted by an element of @xmath59 .",
    "an ordered version of this category is amenable to the theory of lingual structures developed in @xcite , which produces rationality results as above for hilbert series .",
    "we did not state any theorems about hilbert series of @xmath17-modules .",
    "when @xmath4 is finite , one can use the fact that the hilbert series of a finitely generated @xmath17-module is also the hilbert series of a finitely generated @xmath0-module ( use proposition  [ prop : fig - propertyf ] ) , together with known results on hilbert series of ordinary @xmath0-modules ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is possible to define and prove properties about modified versions of our categories to include her category @xmath63 ; we leave the modifications to the reader .",
    "we point the reader to @xcite for applications of the category @xmath62 .",
    "* applications of @xmath17-modules to topology and group theory are studied in @xcite . * in  [ sec : wreath - stab ] , we show that wreath product generalizations of murnaghan s stability theorem follow from the noetherian property for @xmath17-modules . *",
    "in  [ ss : twisted - stab ] , we use the machinery developed in @xcite applied to the category @xmath17 to prove general twisted homological stability results for wreath products @xmath64 when @xmath4 is a polycyclic - by - finite group .",
    "* let @xmath41 be a simply - connected manifold of dimension at least @xmath65 . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the rational homotopy groups of the configuration spaces of @xmath41 satisfy representation stability , i.e. , are finitely generated @xmath0-modules ( see @xcite ) . in ",
    "[ ss : homotopy - conf ] , we outline how this result might be extended when we drop the assumption that @xmath41 is simply - connected by using the category @xmath66 . * as we explain in  [ ss : gendelta ] , representations of the category @xmath5 when @xmath4 is a symmetric group are essentially equivalent to @xmath3-modules , in the sense of @xcite .",
    "this observation was our original source of motivation for studying the category @xmath5 : since @xmath5-modules are much easier to think about than @xmath3-modules , this point of view could be profitable . indeed , our results on @xmath5-modules imply the main theorems about @xmath3-modules from @xcite , and more , and are more straightforward than the proofs given there .",
    "these theorems apply for any @xmath4 , though , and so represent a significant generalization of the theory of @xmath3-modules . * the main theorem on hilbert series of @xmath3-modules in @xcite , theorem  b , was suspected to be suboptimal .",
    "our original motivation in proving theorem  [ mainthm : fs2 ] was to improve ( * ? ? ? * theorem  b ) , which it does .",
    "we subsequently found an even stronger improvement , which appears in ( * ? ? ? * theorem  9.2.3 ) .",

    "an interesting problem is to determine the smallest ( or at least a small ) field @xmath67 with the following property : if @xmath41 is a finitely generated @xmath5-module over @xmath27 then @xmath46 can be written in the form @xmath47 where @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath69 factors as @xmath70 where each @xmath71 is a linear combination of the @xmath72 with coefficients in the ring of integers @xmath73 .",

    "can one always take @xmath77 to be the field generated by the brauer character table of @xmath4 ?",
