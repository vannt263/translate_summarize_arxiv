    "the anti - de - sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite is an explicit and well tested realization of the holographic principle which connects quantum gravity in a @xmath0-dimensional space - time to a conformal field theory on the @xmath1-dimensional boundary of this space - time . in the case of the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , the @xmath0-dimensional space - time is a space - time containing a negative cosmological constant .",
    "often it is easier to deal with the lower - dimensional theory on the boundary than with the full quantum gravity theory .",
    "recently , the abelian higgs model has been studied in a 4-dimensional ads space - time @xcite .",
    "it was found that this model contains string - like solutions . the holographic description of these solutions via",
    "the ads / cft correspondence has been studied and it was found that the space - time around the string contains a deficit angle - very similar to the case in asymptotically flat space - time .    the interest in string - like solutions has grown again over the past years since it is believed that cosmic strings might be connected to the fundamental strings of string theory .",
    "the reason is that mechanisms appear in so - called brane world models @xcite that decrease the fundamental planck scale , i.e. the energy scale of fundamental strings , to much lower energy scales .",
    "moreover , models of brane inflation in which a d - brane and an anti - d - brane collide and annihilate always seem to predict the creation of networks of cosmic strings at the end of inflation @xcite . the objects that form in such brane inflation models are so - called d - strings and f - strings ( for a review see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "d - strings are 1-dimensional d",
    "- branes and are charged under the ramond - ramond potential , while f - strings are the fundamental strings charged under the neveu - schwartz - neveu - schwartz potential . also bound states of p f - strings and q d - strings , so - called p - q - strings are possible .",
    "the interesting thing about these bound states is that they are supersymmetric and the square of the tension of these bound states is equal to the sum of the squares of the tensions of the p strings and the q strings .",
    "field theoretical models describing these bound states have recently been studied @xcite .    in this paper , we study a field theoretical model for p - q - superstrings in a fixed anti - de - sitter background . our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we give the model , the ansatz and the equations and discuss the gravitational effects of p - q - strings . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss our numerical results and we conclude in section 4 .",
    "the metric of the fixed anti - de - sitter background in static , spherical coordinates ( representing the coordinates of an inertial observer ) can be parametrized as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the anti - de - sitter radius and @xmath4 is the negative cosmological constant .    in the following ,",
    "we want to study p - q - strings in this fixed anti - de - sitter background .",
    "the lagrangian describing the p - q - strings reads @xcite : @xmath5 with the covariant derivatives @xmath6 , @xmath7 and the field strength tensors @xmath8 , @xmath9 of the two u(1 ) gauge potentials @xmath10 , @xmath11 with coupling constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 are complex scalar fields ( higgs fields ) .",
    "the potential reads :    v(,)=(^*-^2_1)^2 + ( ^*-^2_2)^2 -_3(^*-^2_1)(^*-^2_2 ) [ pot ]    in order for @xmath16 and @xmath17 to be the global minimum of this potential , we need to require that @xcite @xmath18 when @xmath14 and @xmath15 attain their vacuum expectation values @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , the two @xmath21 symmetries are spontaneously broken to @xmath22 and the particle content of the theory are two massive gauge bosons with masses @xmath23 , @xmath24 and two massive scalar fields ( higgs fields ) with masses @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "each of the two strings consists of a scalar core of radius @xmath27 , @xmath28 and of a magnetic flux tube with radius @xmath29 , @xmath28 .",
    "the ansatz for the matter and gauge fields in spherical coordinates @xmath30 reads @xcite : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 are integers indexing the vorticity of the two higgs fields around the @xmath35axis .    using the above anstze for the metric and matter fields",
    ", the resulting field equations would be partial differential equations .",
    "however , since we want to study cylindrical , vortex - type configurations here we can assume that in the following the matter field functions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 depend only on the specific combination @xmath40 .",
    "the partial differential equations then reduce to ordinary differential equations that depend only on the coordinate @xmath41 and in the limit @xmath42 correspond to the equations of the p - q - strings studied in @xcite .",
    "we define the following dimensionless variable :    @xmath43    then , the total lagrangian only depends on the following dimensionless coupling constants    @xmath44",
    "varying the action with respect to the matter fields , we obtain a system of four non - linear differential equations .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for the matter field functions read : @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where the prime now and in the following denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath49 .    in the general case ,",
    "the solutions to the above equations have to be constructed numerically subject to suitable boundary conditions .",
    "the requirement of regularity at the origin leads to the following boundary conditions : @xmath50    in the special case where @xmath51 and @xmath52 the boundary conditions ( [ eom1 ] ) change according to : @xmath53 while for a @xmath54 , @xmath55 string , they read @xmath56    by letting the derivatives of the non - winding scalar field be zero at the origin instead of imposing the boundary conditions for the fields themselves , the non - winding scalar field can take non - zero values at the origin and a `` condensate '' of the non - winding scalar field will form in the core of the winding string .",
    "the finiteness of the energy per unit length requires : @xmath57      for @xmath58 , we find that @xmath59 and @xmath60 for standard p - q - strings with @xmath51 , @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constants that have to be determined numerically .    for a solution with vanishing winding ,",
    "the behaviour is different . here ,",
    "we present the behaviour for @xmath52 ( the @xmath54 case works analogue ) .",
    "we find that @xmath65 while the corresponding scalar field @xmath66 forms a condensate at the core of the string and behaves as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the modified bessel function of the first kind and @xmath69 @xmath70 is an integration constant .",
    "note that @xmath71 for @xmath72 , while @xmath73 for @xmath74 . + for @xmath75 , we find a power - law behaviour for the gauge field functions @xmath36 and @xmath38 with @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are constants .",

    "this is very difficult since the resulting equations would be partial differential equations . in @xcite , an approximation for weak gravitational fields and string cores much smaller than the anti - de - sitter radius",
    "was used to study the effects of a single abelian string on anti - de - sitter space - time . in that case",
    ", the einstein equations can be linearized .",
    "we employ this method here for p - q - strings .",
    "the metric reads @xcite : @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are functions of @xmath99 and @xmath91 . for @xmath100 ,",
    "i.e. in the absence of the p - q - string , the solution to the corresponding einstein equation would be @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "the metric ( [ metricads ] ) is then just equivalent to the metric of a pure 4-dimensional anti - de - sitter space - time .    introducing the rescaled coordinate @xmath103 and letting @xmath104 , @xmath105 , the connection to the coordinates used before in this paper",
    "is given by the following relations @xcite : @xmath106 letting the functions depend only on the combination @xmath107 , the linearized einstein equation for @xmath97 reads @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the energy - momentum tensor of the p - q - string in the fixed ads background ( see ( 26 ) ) . the deficit angle @xmath111 of the space - time is then given by @xmath112 , where we assume @xmath100 for @xmath113 , i.e. outside of the core of the string .",
    "the deficit angle defined in this way thus `` measures '' the departure of the space - time from a pure anti - de - sitter space - time due to the presence of a p - q - string .",
    "in all calculations , we will fix @xmath114 and @xmath115 and study the properties of the solutions depending on the parameters @xmath116 , @xmath117 and on the windings @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in all numerical calculations ,",
    "we have used the ode solver colsys @xcite .",
    "the presence of a negative cosmological constant tends to decrease the core radii of particle - like objects as compared to flat space - time .",
    "this is also what we observe here . in fig.[ed ] , we plot the energy density @xmath118 of a @xmath119 string for @xmath120 and different values of the parameter @xmath117 as function of @xmath121 .     for @xmath120 , @xmath122 and different values of @xmath117",

    "the presence of the negative cosmological constant thus tends to `` squash '' the energy density into a smaller region of space - time , thus decreasing the core radius of the string .",
    "while the effect is small for the anti - de - sitter radius @xmath117 large compared to the radius of the string core , it becomes much larger when @xmath117 is comparable to the core radius .",
    "due to our choice of parameters we have ( in rescaled coordinates ) that @xmath126 . for @xmath123 ,",
    "the ads radius is thus comparable to the core radius of the strings .    in fig.[energy ]",
    ", we show the dependence of the energy ( per unit length ) of the strings on @xmath117 for @xmath120 and different choices of @xmath93 .",
    "we observe that the decrease of @xmath117 leads to an increase of the energy and that this increase is stronger for strings with higher total winding @xmath127 .",
    "the increase of energy in the case of ads solitons was already observed in @xcite for magnetic monopoles .",
    "is shown as function of @xmath117 for @xmath120 and different choices of @xmath93 .",
    ", width=415 ]    in addition , we observe that the energy curves run nearly parallel for @xmath127 constant .",
    "the increase in energy due to the negative cosmological constant thus seems - to good approximation - only to depend on the sum @xmath127 of the two windings .      in the particular case",
    "where @xmath52 , the scalar field function @xmath66 is not forced to zero at the origin and can develop a condensate inside the @xmath33-string .",
    "the existence of this condensate was observed before in @xcite , but has not been discussed in detail yet . since it seems that strings with condensates in their core `` react '' in a particular way to the presence of the cosmological constant , we study these condensate solutions in more detail here .",
    "first of all note that from the potential ( [ pot ] ) we find that a non - zero value of @xmath37 at @xmath128 can lower the potential energy inside the string core .",
    "the second term in the potential tries to choose a value for @xmath37 that is close to @xmath129 , while the third term tries to choose a value of @xmath37 close to zero .",
    "the potential energy related to these two terms is minimized ( at the origin ) for @xmath130 of course , this is only an approximation at the origin , while in the full system , we would have non - linear effects .",
    "however , we can already see from this approximation that @xmath131 should be decreasing for @xmath116 increasing and would be @xmath132 for @xmath72 , i.e. in the non - interacting case .     at the origin ,",

    "moreover , for a fixed value of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , the condensate decreases for increasing @xmath33 .",
    "the reason for this is that for increasing @xmath33 , the core of the string extends more and more to large @xmath49 .",
    "the condensate does the same and has thus decreasing values of @xmath131 .",
    "we also observe that the decrease in the condensate is stronger going from a @xmath134 solution to a @xmath135 solution than from a @xmath135 to a @xmath136 solution .    in fig.[f0l ] , we show the value of @xmath131 as function of @xmath117 for @xmath120 .",
