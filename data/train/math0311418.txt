    "preprocess @xmath63 into @xmath62 so that there are no bar boundaries an even number of squares along any row .",
    "this must preserve the number of bars .",
    "bars of type 3 consist of one even initial bar and one odd initial bar , and so by lemma [ l : prepstruct ] must be an entire even row and an entire odd row , or an entire even row and the initial odd bar of some other even row .",
    "first assume that @xmath79 .",
    "note that if @xmath80 , then @xmath81 .",
    "so when @xmath79 , @xmath82 .",
    "we claim that the bars of type 3 all consist of entire even row and entire odd row pairs , and that there are exactly @xmath4 of them .    from the observations above , the number of bars of type 3 can not be larger than @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that there is a bar of type 3 consisting of an entire even row and the initial odd bar of some other even row .",
    "since @xmath79 , there must also be two other odd rows , not parts of bars of type 3 , each labelled entirely by some label ( by lemma [ l : prepstruct ] ) .",
    "the total number of bars in these 4 rows is 4 .",
    "so if we relabel ( with new large labels ) these four rows as two bars of type 3 , we save two bars , contradicting the minimality of @xmath62 ( note that relabelling entire rows with some integer larger than any current label preserves legality , provided the parities are correct ) .",
    "we illustrate this ( impossible ) situation below , and show the more economical version .",
    "thus there are no such bars of type 3 .",
    "[ fig : minbartableau3 ]    now suppose that the number of bars of type 3 is smaller than @xmath4 ; thus there is some even row @xmath83 of the tableau which is not part of a bar of type 3 .",
    "also there is an odd row @xmath84 which is not part of a type 3 bar ( since @xmath85 ) .",
    "but we could relabel both these rows with some new large label saving at least one bar and contradict the minimality of @xmath62 .",
    "so there are exactly @xmath4 bars of type 3 , filling @xmath86 rows of @xmath0 .",
    "the remaining @xmath87 rows are odd and so must each be completely filled by a unique label .",
    "so the total number of bars is @xmath3 as required .",
    "1.5em    now assume that @xmath88 .",
    "first we show that we can relabel so that every odd row is part of a bar of type 3 .",
    "so suppose @xmath89 is an odd row which is not part of a bar of type 3 .",
    "_ there is an even row @xmath90 , completely filled by a label , which is part of a bar of type 3 with the initial part of some other even row @xmath91 .",
    "_ proof of claim .",
    "_ assume by way of contradiction that there is not , i.e. that the completely filled even rows are all parts of bars of type 3 with complete odd rows .",
    "but there must be at least one even row @xmath90 ( since @xmath88 and @xmath89 is not part of a bar of type 3 ) which is not part of a bar of type 3 with a complete odd row .",
    "so @xmath90 must not be part of a bar of type 3 at all ( by our claim assumption ) .",
    "but then we could relabel @xmath90 and @xmath89 entirely with some new large label and save a bar , a contradiction .",
    "this proves our claim .",
    "relabel @xmath90 and @xmath89 with some new large label .",
    "this leaves an odd number of squares in the initial part of row @xmath91 , and so preserves legality .",
    "these two rows are now a valid bar of type 3 , and this process did not cost us any bars .",
    "we illustrate one step of this process below .",
    "simply iterate this process until there are no odd rows which are not part of bars of type 3 .",
    "this proves that we can relabel so that every odd row is part of a bar of type 3 .",
    "[ fig : minbartableau4 ]    so every odd row is part of a bar of type 3 , filling @xmath92 rows of @xmath0 . all ( except for possibly one ) of the even rows remaining must be paired up with another remaining even row , and each pair must contain one bar of type 3 ( filling one entire row and the odd initial part of the other row ) and one bar of type 1 ( filling the odd final part of the other row ) . if they were not , we would have two even rows costing 4 strips , and could reduce the number of strips by relabelling as above with large new numbers . the extra row exists only when @xmath11 is odd , and costs two bars ( i.e. one extra )",
    "this situation is illustrated on the right hand side of the above figure .",
    "so we have @xmath93 strips as required .",
    "it remains an open problem to count how many minimal shifted tableau there are for a given shape @xmath0 .",
    "also , it would be natural to generalise theorem [ t : count ] to the skew shifted case .",
    "it is possible to define skew bar tableaux , but the minimal number of bars therein remains an open question ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "here we recall some facts about the projective representations of the symmetric group .",
    "we follow the treatment of stembridge @xcite .",
    "a projective representation of a group @xmath94 on a vector space @xmath95 is a map @xmath96 such that @xmath97 for suitable ( nonzero ) scalars @xmath98 . for the symmetric group",
    ", the associated coxeter presentation shows that a representation @xmath99 amounts to a collection of linear transformations @xmath100 ( representing the adjacent transpositions ) such that @xmath101 , and @xmath102 ( for @xmath103 ) are all scalars .",
    "the possible scalars that arise in this fashion are limited .",
    "of course , one possibility is that the scalars are trivial ; this occurs in any ordinary linear representation of @xmath5 .",
    "according to a result of schur @xcite , there is only one other possibility ( occurring only when @xmath104 ) ; namely @xmath105 all other possibilities can be reduced to this case or the trivial case by a change of scale .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite for details .",
    "it is convenient to regard @xmath106 as elements of an abstract group , and to take [ eq : sigmas ] as a set of defining relations .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath107 let us define @xmath108 to be the group of order @xmath109 generated by @xmath106 ( and @xmath110 ) , subject to the relations [ eq : sigmas ] , along with the obvious relations @xmath111 which force @xmath110 to be a central involution .",
    "by schur s lemma , an irreducible linear representation of @xmath108 must represent @xmath110 by either of the scalars @xmath112 or @xmath110 .",
    "a representation of the former type is a linear representation of @xmath5 , whereas one of the latter type corresponds to a projective representation of @xmath5 as in [ eq : sigmas ] .",
    "we will refer to any representation of @xmath108 in which the group element @xmath110 is represented by the scalar @xmath110 as a _ negative representation _ of @xmath108 .",
    "next we review the characters of the irreducible negative representations of @xmath108 .",
    "define @xmath113 to be the set of all partitions of @xmath8 .",
    "we say that a partition @xmath0 is _ odd _ if and only if the number of even parts in @xmath0 is odd , and is _ even _ if and only if it is not odd .",
    "thus , the parity of a permutation agrees with the parity of its cycle type .",
    "the parity of @xmath0 is also the parity of the integer @xmath114 .",
    "schur showed that the irreducible negative representations are indexed by partitions @xmath0 with distinct parts . recall that if @xmath99 is an irreducible negative representation indexed by @xmath0 that the character @xmath115 is a class function @xmath116 defined by @xmath117 .    if @xmath118 , let @xmath119 be the cycle type ( in @xmath5 ) of @xmath120 . in the sequel we will evaluate @xmath121 instead of @xmath122 . define @xmath123 to be all partitions of @xmath8 such that all parts are odd .",

    "if @xmath137 then @xmath138 when @xmath16 is @xmath139 or @xmath134 .",
    "a combinatorial rule for calculating the characters not specified by schur s theorem was given by morris ; it is the projective analogue of the murnaghan - nakayama rule .",
