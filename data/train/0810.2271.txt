    "<S> in einstein s general relativity theory the metric component @xmath0 in the direction of motion ( x - direction ) of the sun deviates from unity due to a tensor potential caused by the black hole existing around the center of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> because the solar system is orbiting around the galactic center at 200 km / s , the theory shows that the newtonian gravitational potential due to the sun is not quite radial . at the present time , the ecliptic plane is almost perpendicular to the galactic plane , consistent with this modification of the newtonian gravitational force . </S>",
    "<S> the ecliptic plane is assumed to maintain this orientation in the galactic space as it orbits around the galactic center , but the rotational angular momentum of the earth around its own axis can be assumed to be conserved . the earth is between the sun and the galactic center at the summer solstice all the time . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the rotational axis of the earth would be parallel to the axis of the orbital rotation of the earth 15 million years ago , if the solar system has been orbiting around the galactic center at 200 km / s . </S>",
    "<S> the present theory concludes that the earth did not have seasons 15 million years ago . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the water on the earth was accumulated near the poles as ice and the sea level was very low . </S>",

    "<S> + _ subect heading _ : general relativity , solar system , milky way galaxy    if we take @xmath1 where @xmath2 @xmath3 = 1 , 2 , 3 , for the general relativistic metric @xmath4 and assume that the @xmath5 are all so small that their powers higher than the first are negligible , einstein s general relativistic field equations can be simplified into those of the linearized einstein theory .    introducing @xmath6 where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , and assuming that @xmath9 we see that einstein s field equation can be approximated as @xmath10 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) , @xmath11 is a component of the mass energy - momentum tensor such that @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to solve eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( 6 ) is linear in @xmath19 , the mass density , we see that the right - hand sides of eqs , ( 7a ) through ( 7c ) are given by the sum over existing point masses @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> quantities on the right - hand side of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7a ) through ( 7c ) are to be evaluated at the retardation time @xmath20 , but the retardation effect can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> + in the following discussion , we take the solar mass as @xmath21 and the black hole mass as @xmath22 , which exists near the center of the milky way galaxy . in the newtonian limit , @xmath23 0 , we see that @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the distances to the sun and to the galactic center , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the terms proportional to @xmath21 and @xmath22 give the newtonian potentials due to the sun and the black hole at the galactic center , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the newtonian potential due to @xmath22 is negligible compared to that due to the sun . in the solar system , </S>",
    "<S> the solar mass @xmath21 is not moving , but the source mass @xmath22 is moving in the direction tangential to the galactic center , which we call the @xmath27-direction , so that @xmath28 , and @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the velocity of the galactic center with respect to the sun , in the direction tangential to the galactic center . actually , we can write this anisotropy @xmath31 as @xmath32 using the relation @xmath33 , for a circular orbit . because the orbiting speed @xmath30 is 200 km / s , </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy is @xmath34 at the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> the retardation effect is neglected in this estimation .    </S>",
    "<S> einstein also proposed an equation of motion under gravity : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a component of the christoffel symbol . in the nonrelativistic limit , @xmath37 , and </S>",
    "<S> the first term is obtained by taking @xmath38 in eq . ( </S>",

    "<S> therefore , eq . ( 13 ) reduces to @xmath42 where @xmath21 is the solar mass . in eq . </S>",

    "<S> 1992 )     of the solar system around the galactic center ; the ecliptic plane contains the galactic center in such a way that the earth is between the galactic center and the sun at the summer solstice , which implies that the rotional angular momentum of the earth , @xmath43 , is in the galactic plane , about @xmath44 with respect to @xmath45 at present . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the orbiting speed , 200 km / s , remained constant with the radial distance @xmath46 m from the galactic center , orbiting velocity @xmath45 was @xmath47 off from the present direction 15 million years ago . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath45 was parallel to @xmath43 15 million years ago.,width=377 ]    because the solar system is orbiting around the galactic center , the newtonian gravitational force due to the sun is not isotropic , but anisotopic in the direction of the orbiting velocity around the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> the present orientation of the ecliptic plane is almost in the direction that contains the galactic center , as shown in fig .  1 , and </S>",
    "<S> that can be understood taking this general relativistic anisotropy of the newtonian gravitational force into account . </S>",
    "<S> + according to the present theory , the anisotropy of the space force kept the orientation of the ecliptic plane perpendicular to the @xmath45 vector . assuming that the orbiting speed has been @xmath48 km / s , the vector @xmath49 @xmath50 million years ago was off by @xmath47 from the present direction of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting situation of the present orbit of the earth is that the sun is between earth and the galactic center at the winter solstice , and the earth is between the sun and the galactic center at the summer solstice . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the rotational angular momentum of the earth is in the galactic plane making an angle of @xmath47 away from the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath50 million years ago , the orbital angular momentum of the earth around the sun was parallel to its rotational angular momentum @xmath43 ( fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> + at present , the sun is at 23.4@xmath51 north at the summer solstice and 23.4@xmath51 south at the winter solstice . analyzing the reported average temperature at a given location on earth , </S>",
    "<S> we see that the freezing temperature at that location appears when the angular distance of the ecliptic plane from the vertical of that location is more than 50@xmath51 at sea level and 40@xmath51 in the high mountains . </S>",
    "<S> the average temperature at each location is mostly dependent on the rate of energy input by the solar radiation , which is proportional to @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the angular distance between the sun at noon and a vertical at the observational location on the earth . </S>",
    "<S> ( mizushima , 2008a ) . </S>",
    "<S> + if we assume that solar radiation was the main source of the variable energy input to the surface of the earth 15 million years ago , as it is now , the above observation means that the earth everywhere with a latitude greater than 40@xmath51 , both north and south , stayed at a temperature below freezing year around 15 million years ago because there were no seasons . </S>",
    "<S> the equatorial region stayed warm , and water kept evaporating from the oceans . </S>",
    "<S> but atmospheric water vapor fell down to the surface of the earth as snow at higher latitude regions both north and south . on the continents , </S>",
    "<S> the snow did not melt , and accumulated as ice . </S>",
    "<S> although ice also evaporates , it does so very slowly . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a considerable fraction of earth s water remained as ice during the period around 15 million years ago , which resulted in very low sea level . the geological evidence to confirm this effect exists ( vail , et al . , 1977 </S>",
    "<S> ) , as shown in fig .  2 .        </S>",
    "<S> as the ecliptic plane began to deviate from the equator , temperatures at critical latitudes , both north and south , rose , and ice started to melt in the summer seasons , and will keep melting for some time to come . + it is found ( mizushima , 2008b ) that the tangential velocity of the solar system around the galactic center , the orbiting speed @xmath30 as cited in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , was very much smaller that the present value 200 km / s during the earlier life of the solar system . if that is true , the anisotropy factor p was much smaller than its present value . therefore , the anisotropy effect shown by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 15 ) appeared only during the very recent period as discussed here . </S>",
