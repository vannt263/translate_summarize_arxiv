    "for more than fifty years , localization in disordered materials , in particular the corresponding metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , has attracted a lot of interest from both theoreticians and experimentalists.@xcite milestones on this way have been anderson noting the absence of diffusion in certain lattices with disorder,@xcite mott s concept of the minimum metallic conductivity,@xcite the scaling theory of localization,@xcite and the renormalization group approach incorporating electron - electron interaction into localization theory.@xcite in various experiments , the mit has been triggered by diverse control parameters : composition , stress , magnetic field , as well as structure , see for example refs . , which in part substantially contradict each other .",
    "the mit in disordered materials is primarily a zero temperature phenomenon .",
    " we do not consider here the case of an mit which is interrelated with a structural or magnetic phase transition .",
    "such transitions usually occur at some finite temperature , for example in vo@xmath0 and v@xmath0o@xmath2.@xcite by means of doping or applying pressure , the critical temperature may be reduced to zero.@xcite  therefore , in the field of localization , a sample is said to be metallic if its dc conductivity @xmath3 is expected to tend to some finite value as the temperature @xmath4 goes to zero , and it is called insulating if @xmath3 is expected to tend to zero as @xmath5 . of course , in the latter case , @xmath3 is finite at arbitrary finite @xmath4 due to thermally activated transport , in particular variable - range hopping.@xcite    hence , in studying the mit , each evaluation of experimental data includes some @xmath5 extrapolation .",
    "early work on two- and three - dimensional systems judged the @xmath6 curves from a rather global perspective .",
    "only samples , for which @xmath3 drops exponentially with decreasing @xmath4 , were classified as insulating , while all other samples were considered to be metallic.@xcite later , when studying more dense control parameter sets for three - dimensional systems , the focus concentrated on @xmath7 extrapolations of low - temperature data from the metallic control parameter region.@xcite these analyses are based on microscopic theories yielding augmented power laws , @xmath8 , as derived in refs .   and .",
    "in this approach , samples with positive extrapolated @xmath9 value are regarded as metallic , while all other samples are classified as insulating .    simultaneously to this change in perspective , the majority opinion on the character of the mit in three - dimensional samples turned : it shifted from initially supporting mott s minimum metallic conductivity idea toward favoring a continuous transition in accord with the scaling theory of localization.@xcite nowadays , most of the experts in this field seem to be certain about the continuity of the mit , see for example ref .  .",
    "nevertheless , two repeatedly observed phenomena are in conflict with the continuity hypothesis : the scaling of the @xmath4 dependences of @xmath3 in the hopping region@xcite and the existence of specific low - temperature minima in the @xmath4 dependences of the logarithmic derivative , @xmath10.@xcite    it is tempting to ask whether and to what extent the change of the majority opinion may originate from some inherent features of the respective analysis methods which are usually not questioned .",
    "we recall that , in the literature , two different mit criteria have been used in confirming the scaling theory of localization for the three - dimensional case and in disproving it for the two - dimensional case , respectively : in the former situation , the augmented power law extrapolation criterion has been applied to determine the critical value of the control parameter.@xcite in contrast , in the latter case , the sign change of the derivative , @xmath11 , at the lowest measuring temperature has been considered the indication of the altering of the nature of conduction.@xcite one exception within the studies of two - dimensional systems acts as additional motivation for our question : reference used the @xmath5 extrapolation ansatz @xmath12 and obtained an empirical model of a continuous mit .",
    "considering the current literature on the mit in three - dimensional disordered systems , the recent report by siegrist _",
    "et al . _  on gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 and",
    "similar phase - change materials@xcite claims to obtain surprising results : annealing amorphous films of such substances induces a crystallization process with increasing temperature , where a nanocrystalline structure is formed.@xcite during this transformation , @xmath3 increases by orders of magnitude while @xmath6 changes qualitatively , which indicates an mit.@xcite classifying the samples according to the sign of @xmath13 at the measuring temperature , siegrist _ et al .",
    "_  conclude that the studied phase - change materials exhibit a finite minimum metallic conductivity , in contrast to various other disordered substances .",
    "moreover , the authors state that the phase - change materials violate the mott criterion for the critical charge carrier concentration .",
    "they interpret these features to originate from an `` unparalleled quantum state of matter '' resulting from `` pronounced disorder but weak electron correlation'',@xcite see also ref ..    the work by siegrist _",
    "et al._@xcite differs from previous publications , which claim continuity of the mit , not only concerning the substance investigated , but also with respect to the data evaluation approach used .",
    "this again raises the question for the influence of the choice of the data analysis method on the character of the mit obtained .",
    "therefore , we here scrutinize the justification of the conclusions of ref .  , reanalyzing data from this work . due to the interpretation uncertainties mentioned above ,",
    "we take a neutral , phenomenological perspective and avoid , as far as possible , any bias caused by focussing on a particular microscopic theory : our study shows that the @xmath6 for gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 resemble results from previous studies on disordered materials to a large extent . a part of the data can be well approximated by the ansatz @xmath14 , so that , in the same way as used in other investigations , the mit could be characterized as continuous .",
    "however , when checking the justification of this approach by studying the behavior of @xmath10 , new insight is gained : both the sample classifications according to the alternative interpretations are called in question .    reconsidering various publications on the mit in other materials , refs .  ,",
    "from the same perspective , we expose similar inconsistencies : also in these cases , the behavior of @xmath10 , obtained numerically from the measurements without making any assumptions , is not consistent with the common interpretation in terms of a continuous mit with , on the metallic side , @xmath6 following @xmath8 where @xmath15 or @xmath16 . hence , such disproofs of the finite minimum metallic conductivity hypothesis can not be considered as conclusive .",
    "simultaneously , we uncover indications that the mit should be discontinuous at @xmath17 , which are common to a series of studies on different materials . in several cases , however , the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath10 exhibits maxima which are incompatible with this interpretation .",
    "since they are experiment - specific , further , precise investigations of the same @xmath4 range are needed . in this way",
    ", we identify key points for the design of future related experiments .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : section ii discusses various approaches to the precise determination of the transition point between metallic and insulating phases , the first and most important difficulty of experiments on the mit .",
    "section iii is devoted to gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 : in the first subsection , @xmath6 data from ref .",
    "are reanalyzed by means of two alternative approaches . in doing so",
    ", we demonstrate inconsistencies in the data sets which render it impossible to reach definite conclusions about the nature of conduction for three of the samples . in the second subsection ,",
    "several arguments against the hypothetical violation of the mott criterion by gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 are presented ; this deviation is not real , but results from an invalid assumption on the participating states .",
    "section iv compares our findings on gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 with studies on other materials , which favor continuity of the mit .",
    "here we show that , also in these investigations , severe interpretation problems frequently occur when @xmath10 is considered .",
    "finally , section v summarizes our results and draws conclusions for future studies .    in appendix",
    "a , the critical charge carrier concentration of the mit and the charge carrier concentration at which @xmath11 changes its sign in the low-@xmath4 limit , as well as the related @xmath3 value , are determined by means of dimensional analyses . up to unknown dimensionless factors ,",
    "these results agree with mott s estimates of the critical charge carrier concentration and of the minimum metallic conductivity , respectively .",
    "they are found to be stable with respect to a broad class of theoretical approximations , also regarding the incorporation of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "appendix b , considering simple phenomenological hypotheses , studies how the character of the mit determines qualitative properties of sets of @xmath4 dependences of the logarithmic derivative , @xmath10 , for various control parameter values .",
    "it demonstrates that such graphs , obtained directly from experimental data , can be an informative fingerprint of the character of the mit at @xmath17 .",
    "finally , appendix c explains the sophisticated numerical differentiation method being basic for a large part of the data reanalyses presented here .",
    "although , at first glance , the identification of metallic and insulating phases of disordered materials seems to be a simple task , it is far from trivial.@xcite therefore , the general aspects of various approaches , in particular their implicit preconditions and consequences , are discussed in detail in this section .",
    "et al._@xcite characterize the current state of the literature on three - dimensional systems as follows : in experimental studies , the sign of the temperature derivative of the resistivity , @xmath13 , is taken as criterion , where positive and negative @xmath13 indicate metallic and insulating behavior , respectively.@xcite note that this classification refers to the current measuring temperature .  alternatively , as done below , @xmath11 can be considered which always has the opposite sign .",
    " furthermore , siegrist _",
    "et al . _",
    "state that this approach by experimentalists contrasts with theoretical investigations.@xcite those studies consider transport as metallic if , as @xmath5 , the conductivity @xmath3 tends to a finite value , and as insulating if @xmath3 vanishes.@xcite    that summary of the literature is incomplete : as already mentioned in sect .",
    "i and discussed in more detail in subsect .",
    "ii.c and sect .",
    "iv , also quite a number of experimental studies have focused on @xmath7 extrapolations , based on microscopic theories for the metallic phase .",
    "they concern not only doped crystalline semiconductors , but also amorphous transition metal semiconductor alloys and granular systems , see for example refs .",
    ", , and .    more importantly , the above usage of notions by siegrist _",
    "et al . _ , which , by the way , seems to be rather popular among nonspecialists in localization still nowadays , is ambiguous : the transition from metallic to insulating behavior at @xmath17 and the sign change of @xmath13 at finite @xmath4 are two different , only loosely related phenomena .",
    "they should not be confused by using the same term `` metal - insulator transition '' for both of them .",
    "this is illustrated by qualitative considerations in the following three paragraphs .",
    "consider @xmath3 as function of @xmath4 and some control parameter @xmath18 . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the conductivity is identical to zero in the insulating region .",
    " from the empirical perspective , the existence of such a region is a hypothesis , although a very plausible one .",
    "consider for example fig .  2 of ref .",
    ": the convergence of the finite @xmath4 curves to a sharp transition is not proven . in principle , @xmath19 might also continuously vanish in some exponential manner . ",
    "the onset of metallic conduction happens at the @xmath18 value where @xmath19 suddenly starts to deviate from zero .",
    "there , this function of @xmath18 is not smooth , but has some peculiarity .",
    "that means it is either discontinuous or at least not infinitely often differentiable .",
    "this non - analytic behavior of @xmath19 indicates a phase transition , more precisely , a quantum phase transition .",
    "the room - temperature resistivity , @xmath20 , seems to be a smooth function of @xmath18 in the region of the sign change of @xmath21 . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no indication for any peculiarity ( non - analyticity ) of @xmath20 correlated with the sign change of @xmath21 has been reported up to now .",
    "thus , the sign change of @xmath21 very likely does not arise from a phase transition .",
    "moreover , if two interfering mechanisms yield resistivity contributions with different signs of @xmath13 ( as in the case of the kondo effect ) , @xmath22 may exhibit a maximum or minimum , as two curves in the shaded transition region in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "although @xmath23 at such an extremum , this feature can not be interpreted as transition between qualitatively different phases since @xmath22 does not exhibit a non - analyticity there .",
    "nevertheless , one might expect the finite-@xmath4 criterion @xmath23 to yield approximate results for the critical value of the control parameter @xmath18 and possibly for the hypothetical minimum metallic conductivity and the hypothetical maximum metallic resistivity .",
    "to which extent does such an estimate depend on the measuring temperature ? to answer this question , we now compare room - temperature data with measurements at temperatures of the order of 1  k for four groups of materials . thereby , as working definition",
    ", we use the terms room - temperature minimum metallic conductivity , @xmath24 , and low - temperature minimum metallic conductivity , @xmath25 , to denote the @xmath3 values which are related to @xmath23 in the respective temperature regions .    first , considering the temperature range from 5 to @xmath26 , ref .",
    "obtains a maximum metallic resistivity of 2 to @xmath27 for gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "compared to the logarithmic scale in fig .  3 of ref .  , the uncertainty factor of 1.5 is rather small .",
    "the only sample with @xmath28 falling in this interval was prepared by annealing at @xmath29 .",
    "its @xmath30 is almost constant over the whole temperature region considered .",
    "it varies far less than the @xmath30 of the `` neighboring '' samples , which were annealed at 250 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "thus , the values of the critical annealing temperature and of the minimum metallic conductivity depend only slightly on the measuring temperature , so that in this case @xmath32 .",
    "second , the mooij rule,@xcite an empirical relation between the room - temperature values of @xmath13 and @xmath28 , states : for a large number of disordered alloys , the sign of @xmath13 changes from plus to minus with increasing @xmath28 at about @xmath33 . disordered solids with @xmath34 , however , do usually not exhibit any increase in @xmath30 by several orders of magnitude with decreasing @xmath4 , provided they do not undergo some phase transition at finite @xmath4 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath35 .",
    "third , consider the amorphous si@xmath36cr@xmath37 films from refs .   and , prepared by electron - beam evaporation .",
    "their cr contents cover the range from @xmath38 to 0.26 . at low @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath11 changes its sign when @xmath39 and @xmath40 , see figs .  3 and 5 of ref .   and",
    "fig .  7 of ref .. at room - temperature , however , up to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , all samples exhibit positive @xmath11 , see figs .  1 and 7 of ref .",
    "thus , at room - temperature , they all are to be regarded as insulating according to the @xmath43 criterion , so that the critical cr content is overestimated at least by a factor of 1.7 in this way . moreover , @xmath35 .",
    "fourth , concerning localization , the best investigated material is heavily doped crystalline si : p.@xcite in the mk region , @xmath11 changes its sign at a p concentration of about @xmath44 , when @xmath45 , see fig .",
    "3 of ref .   , compare ref .  .",
    "at room - temperature , however , due to the electron - phonon scattering in the exhaustion region , @xmath13 stays positive within the very wide @xmath3 range from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , except for a small interval around @xmath48 , see fig .  1 of the nist study ref .. ( si :",
    "p does not comply with mooij s rule . )",
    "this @xmath3 range is related to a p concentration range from roughly @xmath49 to about @xmath50 , see fig .  4 of ref .. hence , for room - temperature",
    ", inferring the character of conduction from the sign of @xmath13 fails dramatically : samples are marked as metallic even if the p concentration is smaller by a factor @xmath51 than the critical concentration obtained from low - temperature measurements .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the above considered materials , @xmath52 for the region of low p concentrations .    in summary ,",
    "the classification of the conduction character according to the sign of @xmath13 at some finite measuring temperature is questionable for the absence of any non - analyticity at the hypothetical mit point .",
    "moreover , it exhibits considerable uncertainties .",
    "in particular , when this criterion is applied to room - temperature data , both , false - metallic and false - insulating classifications in comparison to corresponding low - temperature evaluations are not unlikely .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we demonstrated that the identification of the nature of conduction according to the sign of @xmath13 at the measuring temperature leads to severe problems .",
    "nevertheless , the question arises whether or not such a differential approach may indicate the mit at least in the limit as @xmath5 . in order to apply this criterion , one would have to determine the control parameter value , for which @xmath23 , at various temperatures .",
    "its @xmath5 limit would identify the mit .",
    "in practice , in particular for two - dimensional systems , the focus is on the transport at the lowest experimentally accessible temperature , @xmath53 , often in the mk range.@xcite that means , the sign change of @xmath54 is regarded as the indication of the mit , instead of a corresponding @xmath5 extrapolation .",
    "of course , this approach can be meaningful only if @xmath55 is so small at the so - determined mit , that the influence of @xmath53 on its location is negligible .",
    "fortunately , this condition seems to be often fulfilled .",
    "nevertheless , one should be very cautious .",
    "the issue is more profound than it appears at first glance for the following reason .",
    "using this criterion means to favor a particular character of the mit , namely the existence of a finite minimum metallic conductivity .",
    "this bias is uncovered by purely experimental experience : for many three - dimensional systems , the @xmath3 value , which corresponds to @xmath13 changing its sign at low @xmath4 , roughly agrees with mott s minimum metallic conductivity estimate,@xcite @xmath56 here @xmath57 denotes the nearest neighbor distance of the transport carrying species at the mit ( e.g.  p atoms in crystalline si : p ) and @xmath58 a numerical constant of order 0.025 to 0.05 .",
    "for example , ganguly _ et al .",
    "_  explicitly use this sign change criterion to determine the value of @xmath59 for oxide systems , see ref .  .",
    "further support for this correlation comes from the original references of the data compiled in fig .",
    "10 of ref .  .",
    "moreover , see fig .  3 of ref .   for crystalline si : p and fig .  7 of ref .   for amorphous si@xmath36cr@xmath37",
    "thus , using the criterion @xmath23 at @xmath53 for defining the mit usually results in support for mott s idea that @xmath59 is the minimum metallic conductivity .",
    "it has to be stressed , however , that this frequently observed correlation does not necessarily imply that mott s related theory is correct .",
    "in particular , it alone does not justify the conclusion that , for each sample with negative @xmath54 , the conductivity @xmath6 can not saturate at some nonzero value far below @xmath59 as @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , this experimental experience is not sufficient to exclude that there might be metallic samples with negative @xmath54 .",
    "hence , interpreting the correlation between @xmath23 at @xmath53 and @xmath59 alone as confirmation of mott s minimum metallic conductivity idea overvalues the experimental findings .    in this sense , relying only on the mit criterion @xmath23 in the limit as @xmath5 means to bias the data analysis , and to presume the existence of a finite minimum metallic conductivity .",
    "that is why the corresponding conclusion by siegrist _",
    "et al._@xcite is not surprising .",
    "it is the natural consequence of these authors focussing on @xmath13 .",
    "note , moreover , that the mit criterion @xmath23 in the limit as @xmath5 does not seem to be in accord with any of the currently available microscopic theories : this criterion is incompatible with the interpretation in terms of an anderson transition caused by the mobility edge crossing the fermi energy . for this model , just at the mit , the number of electrons ( or holes ) excited to extended states would be proportional to @xmath4 ; it is hard to believe that these electrons do not cause a corresponding increase in @xmath3 with rising @xmath4.@xcite this consideration , however , bases on an oversimplification , the negligence of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , also the currently available theories incorporating electron - electron interaction can not provide a justification for the mit criterion considered here , since none of them yields a discontinuous mit with a finite minimum metallic conductivity .",
    "an explanation of the sign change of @xmath13 , being an alternative to the interpretation in terms of an mit , was provided by an analysis of the influence of the electron - electron interaction : according to altshuler and aronov , the electron - electron interaction yields a @xmath60 contribution to @xmath6.@xcite rosenbaum _ et al .",
    "_  pointed out that its sign is determined by the relative importance of exchange and hartree terms , which in turn is controlled by the ratio of screening length and fermi wave length.@xcite thus , the variation of the screening length may cause two sign changes of the @xmath60 contribution.@xcite this interpretation has been very influential up to now .",
    "however , when evaluating the applicability of the theoretical idea by rosenbaum _",
    "et al . _ from ref .  , one should be aware that the value of the exponent , @xmath61 , seems not to agree with experimental findings . for samples ,",
    "which were classified as metallic in the respective original publications , and which exhibit negative @xmath13 at @xmath53 , a series of such discrepancies is presented in our sect .",
    "iv . concerning samples with positive @xmath13 at @xmath53 ,",
    "doubts arise from three publications : already fig .  1 of ref .",
    "shows that , for crystalline si : p , the exponent @xmath16 enables a clearly better approximation of the experimental data than @xmath61 .",
    "figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) of ref .",
    "testify that , for crystalline si : b , @xmath3 versus @xmath60 plots exhibit substantial curvature in the low-@xmath4 range .  the authors of ref .",
    "model this feature by additionally taking into account a localization contribution to @xmath6 , but the deviation visible in fig .",
    "3(b ) questions the physical meaning of the fits .",
    " these observations are compatible with a study of amorphous si@xmath36cr@xmath37 , in which a power law contribution to @xmath6 with the exponent @xmath62 was identified by collective augmented power law fits to data from 15 samples.@xcite remarkably , this decomposition of @xmath6 ceases to be applicable when , with decreasing @xmath18 , @xmath13 at @xmath53 changes its sign from plus to minus.@xcite    therefore , the theoretical interpretation of the sign change of @xmath13 from ref .   should be considered with great caution .",
    "thus , it seems not impossible that the criterion @xmath23 in the limit as @xmath5 may indeed identify the mit . due to this unclear situation , the development of a more appropriate theory is required .",
    "fortunately , one of its features can be easily predicted since , for dimensional reasons , eq .",
    "( [ mmc ] ) is robust , also with respect to the incorporation of electron - electron interactions : if there is a universal relation , which links the nearest neighbor distance of the transport carrying species at the mit with a particular conductivity value , then it must have the form of eq .",
    "( [ mmc ] ) ; for a proof see appendix a. the condition @xmath23 in the limit as @xmath5 is a natural way to define such a characteristic conductivity value . in case a finite minimum metallic conductivity exists , it is expected to equal a universal multiple of this characteristic conductivity value ; it might even coincide with this value .",
    "we now continue with the empirical consideration : to the best of our knowledge , the mit criterion @xmath23 in the limit as @xmath5 is only a hypothesis .",
    "can it be justified ?",
    "it seems natural to regard all samples with @xmath63 at @xmath53 as metallic .",
    "however , for the inverse approach , the classification of all samples with @xmath43 at @xmath53 as insulating , further arguments and / or additional measurements are required .",
    "in particular , this concerns the @xmath30 curves with small slope , for which the interpretation in terms of activated transport may seem counterintuitive .",
    "nevertheless , one can easily imagine a situation where such samples are indeed insulating .",
    "let us assume that some kind of hopping is the only relevant conduction mechanism and that , as already supposed by mott,@xcite its mean activation energy tends continuously to 0 as the mit is approached . in this case",
    ", the existence of insulating samples with quite flat , nonexponential @xmath30 is not counterintuitive but natural : all the samples close to the mit , for which the mean hopping energy is smaller than the lowest measuring temperature , should behave this way , see also subsects .",
    "ii.d and ii.e .",
    "thus , the question arises whether the second part of our assumption is correct . in other words",
    ", we ask : which value does the mean hopping energy tend to as the mit is approached ?    empirical support for",
    "the idea , that the mean hopping energy continuously approaches zero , comes from scaling of the @xmath64 curves for various values of @xmath18 at the insulating side of the mit , see subsect .",
    "ii.e : if such a scaling applies in a certain @xmath3 range for arbitrary @xmath4 below some temperature bound , then , indeed , the condition @xmath23 in the limit as @xmath5 marks the mit.@xcite    the unclear situation described above poses the challenge to find out which of the samples with nonexponential @xmath30 and @xmath43 at @xmath53 are metallic and which are insulating .",
    "various approaches to this question will be discussed in the following subsections .",
    "an alternative to considering @xmath13 at @xmath53 is to detect the mit by quantitatively analyzing measurements in some low - temperature range in terms of a microscopic theory : starting with a theory - based ansatz for @xmath6 with adjustable parameters , one determines the value of the control parameter at which this equation ceases to be valid .",
    "ideally , such an analysis should be performed for both sides of the mit . in this subsection ,",
    "we focus on the metallic side . for the corresponding consideration of the insulating region , see subsect .",
    "ii.d .    considering metallic conduction , augmented power laws ,",
    "@xmath65 were derived for several situations .",
    "altshuler and aronov studied the superposition of electron - electron interaction and static disorder and obtained @xmath15 , see ref .  .",
    "they derived , however , eq .",
    "( [ apl ] ) from a perturbation theory so that its applicability close to the mit is questionable .",
    "nevertheless , in various low-@xmath4 experiments , eq .  ( [ apl ] ) has been claimed to describe measured data rather well , see for example refs . and .",
    "newson and pepper additionally incorporated the @xmath4 dependence of the diffusion constant into the result by altshuler and aronov ; for this they used the einstein relation linking conductivity and diffusion constant.@xcite their approach results in eq .",
    "( [ apl ] ) with a smaller exponent , @xmath66 , see ref .   and compare ref .  .",
    "its derivation , however , presumes @xmath67 . in several cases , this version of eq.([apl ] ) seems to be more appropriate for describing the experimental data than eq .",
    "( [ apl ] ) with @xmath15 , see refs .",
    ", , and .    in practice , the choice of the value of @xmath68 seems not to have a substantial influence on the qualitative behavior of @xmath69 close to the mit.@xcite nevertheless , a modification of @xmath68 as well as a variation of the @xmath4 range , taken into account in the fit , usually cause a slight shift of the resulting mit point .    in a few studies , extensions of eq .",
    "( [ apl ] ) were used to model the experimental data .",
    "for example , investigating crystalline si:(p , b ) , hirsch _",
    "et al . _",
    "included a second @xmath4-dependent term accounting for a weak localization correction due to inelastic electron - electron collisions , @xmath70 with @xmath71 , see ref .  .",
    "not surprisingly , including such a second @xmath4-dependent term improves the fit quality even if the model is not physically justified.@xcite see also subsect.ii.f .    in all data analyses based on eq .",
    "( [ apl ] ) or ( [ apl_ext ] ) , the diagnosis of the breakdown of the theoretical description is the crucial point .",
    "there are the following two approaches to this problem ; both have to be applied .",
    "first , _ relying on the validity of the considered ansatz _",
    ", one determines the value of the control parameter at which one of the adjustable parameters ceases to have a physically reasonable value . in the present situation , one asks at which @xmath18 the parameter @xmath72 reaches 0 .",
    "second , one checks for systematic deviations of the adjusted theoretical @xmath6 relation from the experimental data .",
    "this , however , is a fuzzy condition : the precision and accuracy of the experimental data as well as the width of the considered @xmath4 interval have great influence on strength and assessment of deviations .",
    "presumably because of these uncertainties , the search for systematic deviations has played only a minor role in the literature .",
    "thus , essential information has often been lost , as we will demonstrate in sects .",
    "iii and iv .",
    "when using solely the first approach , there is a considerable risk that , in an analysis according to a theory based on questionable approximations , one misinterprets some insulating samples close to the mit as metallic .",
    "thus , since @xmath73 seems to be continuous , it is not unlikely that one only gets out what is put into the model used in the data analysis , that is the continuity of @xmath19 . in this sense , analyses based only on augmented power law fits exhibit a substantial bias in favor of a continuous mit .    the way out of this dilemma is to consider another observable additionally to @xmath6 . to that end , however , it is not necessary to measure a further transport coefficient or some thermodynamic observable . already considering a specific derivative of @xmath6 can be very helpful as will be explained in subsects .",
    "ii.f and ii.h .",
    "the situation concerning the incorporation of further physical observables will be discussed in subsect .",

    "however , as already pointed to in subsect .",
    "ii.b , @xmath83 seems to vanish as the mit is approached .",
    "this limiting behavior , which is very likely but not completely certain , has an important consequence : consider @xmath64 measurements down to some lowest experimentally accessible temperature , @xmath53 . for each feasible value of @xmath53",
    ", there is an interval of @xmath18 adjacent to the mit , where @xmath84 .",
    "for all samples belonging to this interval of @xmath18 , it is impossible to observe an exponential decrease in @xmath6 by orders of magnitude although they are insulating , see fig .  1 of ref .   and the explanation in its caption .",
    "note that this argument holds regardless of the experimental technique used , for example for studies down to 4.2  k as well as for measurements in a dilution refrigerator . in more concise words : _ since the @xmath4 scale is set by @xmath75 , it is very likely impossible to pass the mit at low temperature_.    because of this problem , and for the possible weak @xmath4 dependence of @xmath80 , fits based on eq .",
    "( [ mer ] ) do not allow the reliable identification of insulating samples very close to the mit .",
    "therefore , these samples may easily be misinterpreted as metallic in such an analysis .",
    "note , moreover , that an unambiguous classification of metallic and insulating samples , based solely on describing @xmath6 alternatively by eqs .",
    "( [ apl ] ) or ( [ mer ] ) , is in principle impossible if @xmath6 has a finite positive slope at the mit : the two analytic functions modeling @xmath6 on both sides of the mit do not fit together at the critical value of @xmath18 , in contradiction to experiments showing that @xmath85 is continuous for arbitrary @xmath86 .      in several studies of two- and three - dimensional systems,@xcite but by far not in all such investigations , the identification of insulating samples has been facilitated by empirical scaling of @xmath64 curves , @xmath87 here , @xmath83 denotes an @xmath18-dependent characteristic temperature . this equation links measurements on different samples . in particular , it relates samples with quite flat @xmath6 to samples with exponential @xmath6 .",

    "to the best of our knowledge , however , such a situation has not been observed up to now .",

    "this begs the question of which additional information on the location of the mit can be gained from studying other observables . at first glance , the idea of using such additional information to reach a less ambiguous classification may look promising .",
    "however , one has to be aware of two fundamental difficulties .",
    "first , as the detailed reanalyses of @xmath90 data from various publications in sects .",
    "iii and iv will show , we currently seem not to have available a reliable microscopic theory on the @xmath4 dependence of the observable @xmath3 .",
    "since this quantity is fundamental in defining the mit , it is therefore unlikely that present theories on other observables can yield better results .",
    "thus , we primarily take an empirical perspective also in this subsection .",
    "second , the mit definition is based on the limit of @xmath3 as @xmath5 .",
    "it presupposes that electric field strength and frequency are infinitely small and that the sample size is infinitely large ; these three conditions are sufficiently well fulfilled in most experiments .",
    "when , instead of @xmath3 , another observable is considered , it is essential also to determine its limiting value as @xmath5 for each sample ; often , additionally , the limit concerning a further measurement parameter tending to zero has to be taken .",
    "these tasks may be very demanding , in particular in case the alternative observable diverges or tends from finite values to zero at one side of the mit : one has to be aware that , in the insulating region , non - exponential and exponential @xmath6 may be correlated with qualitatively different @xmath4 dependences of the alternative observable .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss in detail studies of two alternative observables and illuminate the bias inherent in the assumptions of the respective data analyses .",
    "first , we turn to the behavior of the hall coefficient , @xmath127 .",
    "the donor concentration dependence of this quantity was studied by field and rosenbaum at crystalline ge : sb.@xcite the authors reported that conductivity , @xmath3 , and inverse hall coefficient , @xmath128 , simultaneously tend to zero as the mit is approached from the metallic side , see figs .  1 and 3 in ref .  .",
    "they emphasized that this observation conflicts with theoretical work by shapiro and abrahams , who expected @xmath127 to be almost constant close to the mit.@xcite    at first glance , figs .  1 and 3 of ref .",
    "look very convincing , but caution is advised for two reasons : ( i ) in this work , only data taken at one particular temperature , 8  mk , were published .",
    "( ii ) the smallest @xmath3 value roughly agrees with the estimate of @xmath59 , so that the samples might not be close enough to the mit to observe the theoretically expected asymptotic behavior of @xmath127 , compare the discussion in ref ..    later , the conclusion on @xmath128 tending to zero , drawn by field and rosenbaum , was supported by dai _",
    "et al._.@xcite these authors studied the behavior of the hall coefficient of crystalline si : b.@xcite in this case , the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath128 was extrapolated to @xmath17 by means of augmented power law fits .",
    "however , according to fig .  2 of ref . , one needs to be very cautious again : for the two samples closest to the mit , having dopant concentrations , @xmath129 , of 4.11 and @xmath130 , the adjusted augmented power laws well approximate the experimental data only within rather small @xmath4 intervals . as we will see in subsect .",
    "iv.c , at least the sample with @xmath131 is presumably in fact insulating , so that , in this case , @xmath128 would likely tend to zero if @xmath4 were diminished further .",
    "therefore , when the mit is approached from the metallic side , @xmath132 may well tend to a finite value .",
    "finally , let us consider the study of the hall effect in si : as by koon and castner.@xcite this work addresses both sides of the mit rather than only the metallic side as refs .   and .",
    "according to fig .",
    "4(b ) of ref .",
    ", it seems not unlikely that @xmath127 depends on @xmath4 and @xmath129 qualitatively in the same way as the resistivity @xmath28 .",
    "hence , as shown in the above four paragraphs , studying the hall coefficient does not substantially simplify the mit identification task .",
    "instead , the extrapolation problems , which impede the identification of the mit on the basis of @xmath6 data , occur also in the analysis of @xmath133 .    as a second alternative observable , we now consider the single - particle density of states obtained from tunneling experiments . investigating amorphous nb@xmath37si@xmath36 , hertel _",

    "( the published information is not sufficient for a detailed reanalysis such as presented for various other substances in our sects .",
    "iii and iv . )    for the following two reasons , the mit identification in ref . by means of tunneling measurements is also not conclusive : ( i ) within this study , the tunneling measurements were performed only at a single temperature , 2  k , see fig .  2 of ref .",
    "the authors interpreted the deviations between their empirical fits and the measuring results for tunneling voltages below about 1  mv as an effect of thermal fluctuations .",
    "however , without comparing with measurements at other temperatures , such a specification of the corresponding voltage range remains pure speculation , and so do the zero - voltage extrapolations .",
    " at the insulating side of the mit , the finite-@xmath4 effect can be quite large and influence the density of states at energies far above @xmath134 , see figs .  1 in refs .   and .",
    " ( ii ) the dielectric susceptibility diverges as the mit is approached from the insulating side.@xcite thus , the width of the coulomb gap is expected to tend to zero there , analogously to the characteristic hopping temperature @xmath75 , see subsects .",
    "ii.d and ii.e .",
    "hence , the density increase caused by thermal fluctuations should be particularly large at the mit .",
    "these expectations are in conflict with the tunneling - voltage dependence of the density of states ascribed to the mit in fig .  2 of ref .",
    ".    because of the problems discussed in the two paragraphs above , the experimental results of ref",
    ".   can not be regarded as conclusive support for the mit being continuous , contrary to the interpretation in that study .",
    "in addition to hall coefficient and single - particle density of states , various other alternative observables have been studied close to the mit over the last decades , in particular dielectric susceptibility,@xcite magnetic susceptibility,@xcite thermopower,@xcite and noise.@xcite reconsidering all these experiments is beyond the scope of our work .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the general remarks on the interpretation difficulties of such investigations , made in the second and third paragraphs of this subsection , are valid in all these cases .",
    "we now turn back to the temperature and control parameter dependences of conductivity and resistivity , on which the mit definition is based .",
    "the discussion in subsects .",
    "ii.b to ii.f provided us with two sufficient , but not necessary , generally applicable conditions for identifying metallic and insulating samples , respectively , which both seem to be almost unbiased with respect to the character of the mit : on the one hand , samples with @xmath135 , and thus @xmath136 , at the lowest experimentally accessible temperature , @xmath53 , are very likely metallic . on the other hand , samples with simultaneously @xmath115 and @xmath123 at @xmath53 are with high probability insulating . only for samples that do not fall into one of these two categories , additional measurements at temperatures below @xmath53 are necessary for a reliable decision .",
    "this cautious classification is denoted as the @xmath137 approach in the following .",
    "it has the invaluable advantage to be almost unbiased .",
    "the price one pays is that it can only bracket the location of the mit .",
    "however , the corresponding control parameter gap is far narrower than the uncertainty interval in an analysis by means of stretched arrhenius law fits .",
    "this is due to the conditions @xmath115 and @xmath123 at @xmath53 being fulfilled by a great fraction of those insulating samples for which only nonexponential @xmath6 can be observed above @xmath53 , see subsect .",
    "ii.f .    in summary ,",
    "mainly three criteria are available for determining the mit point : @xmath121 in the limit as @xmath5 ( or at the lowest accessible @xmath4 ) , @xmath138 for augmented power law fits of metallic @xmath6 , and the @xmath137 approach described in the previous paragraphs . for low - temperature measurements at a few k or below , the corresponding critical values of the control parameter may be close to each other .",
    "simultaneously , however , the conclusions about the character of the mit can differ qualitatively due to the bias inherent in the first and second approaches , which favor discontinuity and continuity of the mit at @xmath17 , respectively .",

    ", the @xmath103 window was correspondingly expanded if necessary .",
    "the reliability of this procedure was checked in two different ways : first , for @xmath155 , the @xmath6 data were alternatively reconstructed from the @xmath140 versus @xmath156 plot in fig .",
    "8s of the supplementary information of ref .   .",
    "at low @xmath4 , this graph has a far better resolution than fig .  3 of ref .  .",
    "thus , @xmath105 could be determined using a @xmath103 window of width 0.3 over the whole @xmath4 range , without the occasional interval expansion mentioned above .",
    "figure [ w_fig ] shows that both the independently obtained @xmath105 curves for @xmath155 nicely agree with each other .",
    "second , several unusual patterns of the curves were analyzed .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath155 , the minimum at 63  k turned out to be not an artifact of the digitalization , but to originate from an offset of the parts of the curve below 61  k and above 65  k , respectively , by roughly 1  k. this offset is also visible in a large magnification of the original graph .",
    "hence , although the @xmath6 data are sufficiently precise for an overview , they exhibit artifacts , which substantially influence @xmath105 . therefore one should be cautious in judging the abnormal features of @xmath105 , which are discussed in the following .",

    "thus , the impression from fig .",
    "[ aa_fig ] is supported , that already annealing at 225 @xmath161 should be sufficient to reach clear metallic behavior .",

    "[ aa_fig ] would be applicable only by chance .",
    "moreover , also the mott variable - range hopping behavior for @xmath155 would not be generic but result from the superposition of two mechanisms .",
    "another possibility is that the exponent in the augmented power law fit might increase when approaching the mit .",
    "thus , the simple @xmath145 extrapolation procedure might erroneously classify a metallic sample as insulating .",
    "however , such a considerable increase of @xmath68 in the vicinity of the mit seems to contradict the common experience with other materials , compare subsect .",
    "ii.c and sect .",
    "on the other hand , the positive slope of @xmath105 at low temperatures for @xmath147 might also be caused by various experimental problems such as incomplete thermalization or joule heating .",
    "the low-@xmath4 deviations for @xmath155 mentioned above point in this direction . they may originate from a continuous resistance measurement with too fast sliding temperature . a more clear picture will probably be obtained when , for a comparably small number of @xmath4 values , the resistance is always measured only after careful thermalization.@xcite of course , the effect of such an improvement of the measurement has to be checked for all samples . in particular , it will be intriguing to see how , for @xmath162 and @xmath143 , the seemingly good agreement between measured data and regression lines in fig.[aa_fig ] and between numerically and analytically obtained @xmath105 curves in fig .",

    "this carrier concentration reproduces the observed minimum metallic conductivity .",
    "this consistently indicates that the critical charge carrier concentration is more than a factor of 25,000 larger than the mott prediction !",
    "we are not aware of any other solid where a similar deviation has been observed.''@xcite    this statement , however , is based on a highly questionable assumption : siegrist _ et al . _",
    "presume that the transport proceeds via shallow impurity states .",
    "only the wave functions of such states may have an extension of more than 100  .",
    "in contrast , the wave functions of impurity states deep in the gap are far more localized .",
    "it is very likely that these deep states govern the electric conduction process in gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 , as is supported by the following series of independent arguments .    according to yu and cardona ,",
    "see chapter 4.2.2 in ref .",
    ", impurity levels tend to be shallow if the cores ( atom minus its outer valence electrons ) of host and impurity atoms resemble each other .",
    "if , however , the impurity induces a substantial strongly localized potential , the arising central cell corrections most likely cause the center to be a deep one .",
    "vacancies belong to the second of these two classes of crystal imperfections . how they induce deep levels",
    "is discussed in chapter 4.3 of ref .",
    ", see also fig .",
    "4.5 therein .    in this context , it is noteworthy that siegrist _",
    "_  conclude from their measurements that the concentration of vacancies in gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 is high , see fig .",
    "6a in ref .   and the last but one paragraph of page 4 of the supplementary information of ref .  .",
    "in the latter , the authors state `` ... the empty lattice sites play a crucial role in reducing the electrical conductivity in these phase change materials . ''",
    "hence , the concentration of deep levels in the gap should be high and substantially affect the electronic transport .",
    "the influence of vacancies on the electronic structure of various configurations of gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 was recently investigated by zhang _",
    "et al . _",
    "by means of density functional theory calculations.@xcite these authors showed that a high concentration of vacancies implies a high density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "studying the inverse participation ratio of the cubic gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 phase with random occupation , they observed that these states are localized to regions of only 2560 atoms .",
    "their volume is smaller by orders of magnitude than the spatial extension of a shallow impurity state .",
    "kato and tanaka studied the annealing process in ge@xmath0sb@xmath0te@xmath167 films , a related material.@xcite they concluded that , in the face - centered cubic phase , the chemical potential is situated 0.15  ev above the valence band edge.@xcite this value is considerably larger than the excitation energy of a shallow doping level , estimated as 8.6  mev in ref .  .",
    "thus , this position of the chemical potential supports the hypothesis that deep levels with strongly localized wave functions play an essential role .",
    "moreover , the relevance of conventional shallow impurity states is doubtful due to the following two reasons : ( i ) textbook derivations of the properties of a shallow impurity state consider a single impurity in an otherwise perfect infinite crystal .",
    "it is therefore questionable to make use of these results in a situation with a very large number of crystal imperfections within the range of the hypothetical shallow donor or acceptor wave function .",
    "( ii ) due to the nano - crystalline structure , strain as well as boundary effects may considerably influence the electronic properties of the crystallites .",
    "thus , additional doubts on the applicability of this textbook derivation arise from the grain size of the nano - crystalline gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 films being only of the order of 10 to 20  nm , see p.  4 of the supplementary information of ref .  .",
    "in the case of a bohr radius of 100   , the probability density would still have substantial finite values at a grain surface for almost all shallow impurity states .",
    "our counter - arguments to the interpretation in ref .",
    ", which have been presented in the previous paragraphs , raise the following question : how will a `` standard '' material behave in an analogous annealing experiment ? such a study was performed by song and co - workers for amorphous si very heavily doped with p or b.@xcite ( for crystalline si , these elements are typical shallow donors and acceptors , respectively . ) these authors deposited a - si : h films with p and b concentrations of 0.41 and 0.42  at@xmath168 , respectively , such that the spatial concentrations amount to about @xmath169 .",
    "this value is by about a factor 50 larger than the critical concentrations for the mit in crystalline si : p and si : b .",
    "nevertheless , the amorphous films showed clearly activated conduction at room - temperature .",
    "their conductivities amounted to @xmath170 and @xmath171 , respectively .    in the annealing",
    ", the films were dehydrogenated , and heavily doped nano - crystalline si was formed . in this process , the conductivity increased by orders of magnitude up to 5.3 and @xmath172 , respectively . simultaneously , the `` conductivity activation energy '' , @xmath173 , decreased by a factor of 10 for p doping , and the conductivity almost completely lost its @xmath4 dependence in the case of b doping . according to the @xmath23 criterion used by siegrist _",
    "_ , this means the mit had still not been reached in the case of p doping , although the p concentration was so much larger than the critical concentration for crystalline si : p . however , for b doping , the mit had probably already almost been reached or even crossed .",
    "these findings resemble to a large extent the observations in gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 by siegrist _",
    "et al . _ , which is a clear counterargument against those authors claim of an `` unparalleled quantum state of matter '' .",
    "song _ et al .",
    "_  interpret their results in terms of a shift of the fermi energy due to annealing.@xcite simultaneously with the change of the activation energy , the character of the participating states should alter , from deep , strongly localized states toward shallow , far more extended states . in this process , according to eq .",
    "( [ mott_crit ] ) , the critical charge carrier concentration , @xmath164 , decreases so that the mit happens primarily due to a variation of @xmath164 analogously to stress tuning of the mit in heavily doped crystalline si.@xcite the same mechanism should govern the mit in gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 , where the transition occurs sometime in the recrystallization process , not at its end .    summarizing the above arguments , it seems to be very likely that strongly localized states deep in the gap play the crucial role in the transport close to the mit in gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 , which is induced by annealing .",
    "these states have a far smaller spatial extension than the shallow states .",
    "hence , it is not meaningful to relate the critical charge carrier concentration with the bohr radius of shallow states . in this way , the discrepancy between critical charge carrier density and bohr radius , which is stressed by siegrist _ et al . _  in ref .",

    "the corresponding @xmath4 values seem to be specific to the individual experiments , but they do apparently not depend on the particular control parameter , which gives rise to serious doubts about the soundness of this finding .    therefore , the reanalyzed studies can not be considered as conclusive support for a continuous mit . instead , contrasting the `` high - temperature '' parts of figs .",
    "[ castner ] , [ sip_1 ] , [ sip_2 ] , [ sarachik ] , and [ ptc ] with the four graphs for hypothetical scenarios of the mit in appendix b supports the hypothesis that @xmath19 exhibits a discontinuity at the mit .",
    "nevertheless , since the experimental data are not completely consistent , further and more precise measurements are challenged .",
    "to investigate whether or not recent , seemingly very surprising experimental results on the mit in disordered systems are striking indeed , we started in sect .",
    "ii with elucidating the fundamentals of the corresponding data evaluation . for this aim",
    ", we analyzed the available approaches to discriminate between metallic and insulating samples .",
    "making this decision is by far not as simple as it might seem at first glance .",
    "our detailed consideration of this task highlighted substantial biases inherent to the diverse available methods , which have been overlooked in many publications .",
    "the mit is primarily a zero - temperature phenomenon .",
    "therefore , in contrast to early studies as well as to the recent ref . , related decisions can be reached only by @xmath5 extrapolations . as an approximate substitute",
    ", the value of some physical observable at the lowest measuring temperature may be identified with its value at @xmath17 , provided , at the mit , when @xmath5 , this observable does neither diverge nor tend from finite values to zero .",
    "the criterion `` sign change of @xmath13 at the lowest experimentally accessible temperature '' has often been used in the literature . in several cases ,",
    "the corresponding conductivity value was found to roughly equal mott s estimate of the hypothetical minimum metallic conductivity .",
    "however , such a correlation is natural already for dimensional reasons .",
    "it alone must not be considered a confirmation of mott s theory as long as claiming all samples with negative @xmath13 to be insulating is only an assumption in the data analysis . moreover",
    ", this criterion seems to be incompatible with currently available microscopic theories , in particular with an anderson transition , occurring when the fermi energy crosses a mobility edge .",
    "thus , the criterion `` sign change of @xmath13 at the lowest experimentally accessible temperature '' exhibits a substantial interpretation bias toward a discontinuous mit with a finite minimum metallic conductivity .",
    "an alternative approach , which has been frequently applied for the last three decades , tries to find out when the metallic region is left while the control parameter is varied . in this case",
    ", the failure of the augmented power law approximation of @xmath6 is taken as mit criterion . in an analogous manner , @xmath6 ceasing to be describable by a stretched arrhenius law may be interpreted as indication of leaving the insulating region .",
    "both these approaches tend to misclassify weakly insulating samples as metallic .    however , it is just these weakly insulating samples exhibiting non - exponential @xmath6 within the accessible @xmath4-range , which have to be reliably discriminated from metallic ones close to the mit .",
    "the central significance of this task renders the trusty characterization of the mit very challenging : an incorrect classification of one or of a very few samples can change the answer to the question whether , at @xmath17 , the mit is continuous or discontinuous .",
    "therefore , the tendency to misinterpret weakly insulating samples as metallic causes a bias toward continuity of the mit .",
    "moreover , in case the mit is continuous , such a misclassification can considerably modify the obtained value of the critical exponent of @xmath9 .",
    "since the mean hopping energy very likely continuously tends to zero when the mit is approached from the insulating side , going to lower and lower temperatures is of limited value in the characterization of the mit : in each real experiment , there is a control parameter region of finite width , in which only non - exponential @xmath6 can be observed although the corresponding samples are insulating .",
    "for this reason , each success in unambiguously classifying a given set of samples , which is reached by diminishing the lowest accessible @xmath4 value , is ruined again , when the density of the considered values of the control parameter is increased .    in other words",
    ": the relevant temperature scale is set by the mean hopping energy .",
    "hence , very likely in each experiment , when continuously varying the control parameter , one passes the mit at high temperatures .    in this context , the study of the logarithmic temperature derivative of the conductivity , @xmath251 , is very helpful in classifying individual samples : provided a sample with negative @xmath13 , corresponding to positive @xmath112 , is metallic , and furthermore provided that its @xmath6 follows an augmented power law , the slope @xmath124 is positive .",
    "thus , all samples , for which , at low @xmath4 , @xmath115 and @xmath126 hold simultaneously , must be insulating .",
    "( here we use the general principle that an experiment can not prove a hypothesis , but that it can falsify it . )",
    "the above implication has the big advantage to unambiguously identify also a large part of the weakly insulating samples .",
    "it should be noted however , that it is based on an assumption , although a plausible one : for each metallic sample with @xmath115 , the deviation of @xmath6 from augmented power law behavior is expected to be small in the sense that @xmath120 retains the positive sign .",
    "the logarithmic derivative @xmath112 yields valuable information also on two other points : first , it is very sensitive to experimental inaccuracies which , although being small , may qualitatively alter the judgement on the nature of conduction of individual samples , for examples see sects .",
    "iii and iv .",
    "second , even more important , flow diagrams of @xmath105 for sets of control parameter values enable conclusions about the character of the mit .",
    "such diagrams for simple phenomenological models of continuous and discontinuous transitions differ essentially from each other as was demonstrated in appendix b.    we utilized the above ideas to scrutinize the seemingly surprising conclusions of the recent work by siegrist _",

    "first , as demonstrated in subsect .",
    "iii.a , the @xmath6 curves of gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 resemble data from other disordered materials in the following sense : there are two gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 samples for which @xmath6 can be well approximated by the low-@xmath4 ansatz @xmath145 . for one of these samples , the parameter @xmath72 has a positive value , being small in comparison to the minimum metallic conductivity estimate . for the other ,",
    "@xmath72 is approximately zero . in previous experiments ,",
    "such a situation was interpreted as indicating a continuous mit , where the sample with the positive value of @xmath72 is considered as metallic .",

    "second , the asserted deviation of the critical charge carrier concentration from the mott criterion value is unfounded since the latter was obtained in ref .   from an unrealistic guess of the bohr radius of the participating states : in subsect .",
    "iii.b , several arguments were given for the electronic transport in the insulating region proceeding via deep impurity states originating from vacancies instead of via shallow ones as presupposed in ref .  .",
    "the latter states can only be relevant in high - quality crystalline materials , additionally provided that the cores of host and impurity atoms resemble each other .    in consequence",
    ", there is no reason to agree with siegrist _",
    "_  with respect to ascribing an unusual quantum state of matter to gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 and related phase - change materials .    nonetheless , in subsect .",
    "iii.a , also the widely - used analysis by means of @xmath145 fits was found to be problematic : we checked the validity of this approximation by considering the logarithmic derivative @xmath105 . on the one hand , for metallic samples , @xmath157 as @xmath5 is expected , where @xmath112 may be either positive or negative .",
    "moreover , validity of @xmath145 would imply @xmath252 . on the other hand , for insulating samples , at sufficiently low @xmath4",

    "however , although @xmath254 within a wide @xmath4 range , @xmath105 seems to vanish as @xmath5 .",
    "such a behavior may indicate metallic transport with an exponent considerably exceeding @xmath61 or , alternatively , a superposition of at least two @xmath4-dependent mechanisms .",

    "therefore , a precise determination of the transition point between metallic and insulating behavior is impossible at this stage . in consequence ,",
    "the answer to the question whether the mit in gesb@xmath0te@xmath1 is continuous or discontinuous currently depends on the perspective chosen , so that this problem still has to be considered as open .    in part",

    "hence , the extrapolations based on @xmath145 or @xmath219 are not justified , so that the conclusions about the continuity of the mit in refs .  , ,",

    "for @xmath230ge : ga , @xmath255 at the mit can be ruled out , while a continuous mit with @xmath256 seems unlikely , but not impossible .",
    "more precise @xmath6 measurements are required for a final decision .",
    "\\(v ) the thin films of disordered gd studied in ref .",
    "exhibit substantial low - temperature deviations of the @xmath105 data , which we calculated numerically , from the analytical differentiation of @xmath141 power law fits with adjustable @xmath68 .",
    "this questions the basic assumptions of the interpretation in ref .  .",
    "further , more precise measurements , taking into account also moderately lower temperatures , are required to decide this case .",
    "\\(vi ) finally , for nanogranular pt in carbon , the @xmath105 data presented in ref",
    ".   clearly disagree with @xmath105 curves which were obtained analytically from the @xmath145 fits therein .",
    "this finding disproves one of the main results of ref .  ,",
    "i.e.  the observation of an @xmath160 behavior .    as a whole , our reanalyses provide overwhelming evidence against the common interpretations of the conductivity data in terms of a continuous mit with @xmath258 and @xmath15 or @xmath16 at the transition .",
    "simultaneously , questioning the @xmath7 extrapolations , they shed new light on the long - standing exponent puzzle of the mit : all the different critical exponent values obtained in various experiments may have no physical meaning .    when disregarding measurements at temperatures below the puzzling maxima of @xmath105 , one feature is common to the @xmath105 obtained from the reconsidered studies on different materials in sect .",
    "iv : when approaching the mit at fixed @xmath4 from the insulating side , @xmath112 decreases and @xmath124 stays negative down to @xmath112 values below 0.2 , in the cases of si : as and si : p even down to @xmath112 values below 0.1 .",

    ". to us , the discontinuity hypothesis ( c ) seems to have the best chances to be valid : it is supported by the comparison of the experimental @xmath105 flow diagrams with the results for the phenomenological models considered in appendix b. moreover , it is in accord with refs . and devoted to the investigation of amorphous si@xmath36ni@xmath37 and si@xmath36cr@xmath37 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , at the current stage , this judgement on the character of the mit is still only speculation .    in conclusion , to achieve a compelling phenomenological description of @xmath6 close to the mit , the transition has to be considered from different perspectives .",
    "in particular , consistent @xmath105 data from a series of samples have to be obtained from experiment .",
    "thus , since @xmath105 is very sensitive to small errors of @xmath6 , high precision and accuracy of the measurements is most important : in future experiments , resistance measurements should be performed only after securing complete temperature equilibration for each individual @xmath4 value as in ref .  , instead of taking data with floating @xmath4 .",
    "since the @xmath6 curves are only weakly structured , the therefore necessary reduction in the number of data points is not an issue .",
    "moreover , the linearity of the current - voltage relation has to be carefully checked to suppress the influence of joule heating as well as that of non - ohmic effects .",
    "finally , thermal decoupling problems have to be excluded thoroughly , even if they are so small that they can not be noted during a conventional plausibility inspection of @xmath6 . for corresponding tests ,",
    "@xmath105 data from insulating samples are very useful : they have to exhibit systematic control parameter dependence and @xmath261 down to the lowest measuring @xmath4 .",
    "to meet these prerequisites is absolutely necessary for the reliability of experimental studies of the mit .",
    "such a strategy focussing on @xmath105 diagrams for sets of samples should enable sensitive checks of the individual data analysis approaches . thus , it should be very helpful in resolving discrepancies between evaluations from different perspectives as have been uncovered in the present work . only if precision and/or accuracy improvements fail to yield an unambiguous sample classification , the intricate extension of the temperature range toward lower @xmath4 will be indispensable to identify the mit and to clarify its character .",

    "provided the relevant input quantities are known , dimensional analysis can yield valuable restrictions on the possible outcome of detailed theories . here , we apply this approach to studying the mit in heavily doped crystalline semiconductors .",

    ", the latter quotient should be only slightly larger than 1 in case of a continuous mit .",
    "it is identical to 1 for a discontinuous mit at which @xmath11 changes sign in the limit as @xmath5 .",
    "the characteristic conductivity , @xmath281 , expressed in si base units , is a multiple of ( a@xmath264s@xmath268)/(kgm@xmath268 ) in the three - dimensional case .",

    "again , within the metallic region , in case @xmath115 , the slope of @xmath312 is always positive . in the insulating region , however , the sign of the slope varies : four of the curves exhibit a minimum .",

    "however , the wider the interval , the stronger is the influence of nonlinearities . in consequence , there is an optimum interval width .    when not only two , but many data points are taken into account , the corresponding averaging further reduces the influence of the noise .",
    "thus , we aim to slide a window along the curve and to estimate the local slope by means of linear regression on all data points within the window . in case of equidistant argument values , this can be done by applying a special savitzky - golay filter , where the slope value is related to the average of the smallest and largest argument values within the window.@xcite    for the present study , however , we need a procedure which is applicable to the general case of non - equidistant arguments .",

    "we remind here that , when considering difference quotients obtained from two data points with the arguments differing by @xmath349 , the midpoint formula is far superior to forward and backward differentiation formulas .",
    "the reason is that , in the former case , the leading term of the truncation error arising from nonlinearities is proportional to @xmath350 , while , in the latter case , it is proportional to @xmath349 and thus usually considerably larger .    consider now the physical quantities @xmath18 and @xmath351 which are linked by the function @xmath352 .",

    "thus , when rescaling all @xmath376 by a factor @xmath377 , one has to multiply the leading term of the truncation error of @xmath378 by the factor @xmath379 . in this sense , when the number of data points is kept fixed , the truncation error of the value of @xmath380 is proportional to the square of the window width , @xmath381 , and thus usually far smaller than that of the value of @xmath382 for @xmath383 , which is proportional to the window width itself .",
    "this result corresponds to the properties of the truncation errors of two - point formulas mentioned above .",
    "therefore , relating to @xmath367 enables the use of quite wide windows including rather large numbers of data points . in this way",
    ", the random errors of the derivative values obtained by numerical differentiation can be considerably reduced compared to the random errors of two - point formulas .",
    "moreover , due to the averaging , the prefactor in the truncation error of the derivative value obtained by our approach is usually significantly smaller than that for the two - point midpoint formula considering the same argument interval . in consequence ,",
    "a far smaller total uncertainty of the value of @xmath384 can be reached by linear regression with relating the slope to @xmath367 than by applying common difference quotient approaches .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the influence of the truncation error may be diminished even further . for this aim",
    ", @xmath357 has to be transformed to a function @xmath385 with weaker nonlinearity .",
    "after calculating @xmath386 by means of the procedure described above , one obtains the @xmath384 data using common differentiation rules .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that the presented method is very flexible .",
    "we have utilized it in various ways , sliding a window along experimental relations @xmath357 and obtaining pointwise @xmath384 from all @xmath354 within the window .",
    "as always with numerical differentiation , the art of applying this method consists in the choice of an appropriate window width guaranteeing a reasonable compromise between two demands : on the one hand , the noise of the obtained derivative of @xmath357 shall be sufficiently small , while , on the other hand , the essential features of @xmath387 shall not be smeared out too much .",
