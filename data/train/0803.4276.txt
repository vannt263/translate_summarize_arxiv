    "magnetic confinement of neutral atoms is presently a mature technique to produce and study ultracold atomic phenomena . during the last decades , many trapping @xcite and guiding @xcite configurations have been devised and experimentally implemented . in these experiments , the magnetic force acting on a species is the dominant confining interaction ; additional forces , such as the quadratic stark interaction @xcite , are sometimes used to modify the trapping / guiding potential .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have discussed the general theory of combined confinement of neutral atoms . in this new approach , several force fields are tailored so that their combined action results in a confining potential , although each single component , in the absence of the other forces , does not .",
    "the forces considered are the magnetic force acting on a paramagnetic species , the diamagnetic force , the quadratic stark interaction and the standard uniform gravitational field .",
    "key points in using combined potentials for trapping neutral particles are the removal of the constraint of working in a minimum of a single potential  for example , the trap is located in a region of non  vanishing magnetic field , which prevents confined atoms to undergo majorana spin  flips  , and flexibility in designing the confinement potentials",
    ". moreover , the combined approach provides a way to achieve both tight confinement and weak trapping potentials .    in this paper , we describe the experimental implementation of a combined trap for neutral atoms relying on the combination of a magnetic potential and gravity .",
    "cold @xmath0rb clouds generated with a magneto  optical trap ( mot ) @xcite are supported against gravity using a precisely tailored magnetic field , which also provides radial confinement .",
    "an important aspect regards the role of both force fields : gravity , which usually makes up only a vertical perturbation of the overall potential , is essential here for trapping , as the magnetic potential by itself would not be able to trap the atoms .",
    "the first and , thus far , only achievement of gravito  magnetic trapping of neutral atoms was reported in @xcite , where weak three  dimensional confinement allowed to reach extremely low temperature in a condensate . as shown in @xcite , gravity",
    "even represents a limiting factor in this experiment : the gravitational field sets a lower bound to the total curvature of the potential well , a constraint that can be overcome by moving to micro or null  gravity experiments @xcite .",
    "the conditions obtained , namely low temperatures and densities , have thus far been exploited to study quantum reflection @xcite and to realize interferometry between clouds in the condensate phase @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field source geometry presented in this letter is compact and cylindrically symmetric .",
    "the flexibility in trap design reflects the possibility to easily control the field parameters ( eg the curvatures and thus the trap frequencies ) , leaving the trap minimum location unperturbed .",
    "the setup exhibits a sound optical access , a parameter that can be further optimized by means of a planar configuration @xcite .",
    "all these features improve the trap used in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which , for example , the trapping region is located only a few mm from a current - carryng wire .",
    "due to its symmetry , the described gravito ",
    "magnetic confinement geometry can be seen as a first step towards the realization of extremely weak trapping potentials , in which the limits set by @xcite can be overcome by exploiting additional , static electric fields .",
    "assuming adiabatic evolution of the spin in a non uniform magnetic field , the general form for the gravito ",
    "magnetic potential in the case of a paramagnetic low  field seeking ( lfs ) atom is @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents an offset value , @xmath3 the atom mass , @xmath4 the modulus of the gravity acceleration , @xmath5 the magnetic quantum number , @xmath6 the land factor for the atomic state , @xmath7 the bohr magneton , and @xmath8 the magnetic field ; the uniform gravitational field is assumed to be directed along @xmath9 , which is chosen to be the symmetry axis of our cylindrical coordinate system and for the applied magnetic field .    imposing @xmath10 to be a confining potential centred in a point requires the gradient of @xmath10 to vanish and , as a necessary condition , the trace of the hessian of @xmath10 , or , equivalently , its laplacian , to be non  negative in the neighborhood of that point . setting the trap centre at the origin , the condition on the gradient along @xmath9 becomes : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the axial gradient of the axial component of the magnetic field , evaluated at the origin , and the parameter @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 , with @xmath15 . for the @xmath16 , @xmath17 state of @xmath0rb , the value of the parameter @xmath13 is equal to -15.39 g / cm .",

    "the gravitational contribution , equivalent to a flat and inclined potential , has a vanishing hessian .",
    "consequently , only the magnetic contribution defines the confining features of the overall combined potential .",

    "the requirement of both curvatures being positive ( if a curvature vanishes , higher  order terms have to be taken into account ) results in the inequality pair @xmath30     axial magnetic potential ( thin , continuous line ) , gravitational potential ( dashed line ; @xmath31 ) , and axial combined potential ( bold , continuous line ) of the gravito  magnetic trap . size and depth of the resulting potential well are determined by the position @xmath32 of the closest point to the origin where the magnetic field vanishes.,width=321 ]    the locus of the points where the magnetic field vanishes , allowing the atoms to escape the potential well by flipping their spin , determines depth and size of the confining potential . as a consequence of the requirement of positive radial curvature in the origin",

    "the centre of the mot and the minimum of the combined trap were imposed to be coincident . for the mot operation",

    "@xmath44 atoms were loaded in the mot with a typical loading time of 3.4 s. the hwhm of the cloud was about 0.5 mm .",

    "the coils were placed on two different planes , parallel to the horizontal sides of the glass cell and with a vertical separation of 16.0 mm . the position and size of the six coils",
    "were optimized to comply with geometrical and power consumption constraints .",

    "each pair was used to control one of the three first terms of the taylor expansion of the magnetic field in the configuration centre : more precisely , the internal , central and external coils were used to control @xmath27 , @xmath12 and @xmath26 , respectively .",

    "geometric imperfections of the coils , such as tiny displacements of the current - carrying wires from their desired positions , are the main cause for the discrepancies .",
    "the chosen triplet @xmath49 satisfies the confining conditions stated in the previous section for the state @xmath16 , @xmath17 of @xmath0rb . at its bottom , the resulting potential well has calculated curvatures corresponding to axial and radial frequencies of @xmath56 hz and @xmath57 hz , respectively .",

    "neglecting the effects of higher order terms in the taylor expansion of the axial magnetic field  the third  order contribution @xmath60 is equal to -26 g / cm@xmath37 and therefore does not significantly affect the present discussion  it is easy to show that the axial field reaches a gradient @xmath62 at @xmath63 mm .",
    "the magnetic gradient force in that position exactly compensates gravity for the two remaining trapped states , i.e. @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 . in this case , the trap is considerably larger ( the axial and radial size are about 3.5 mm and 8 mm , respectively ) and deeper ( depth of order @xmath64k ) . at its bottom , the axial curvature still corresponds to a frequency of @xmath56 hz , whereas for the radial curvature the corresponding frequency turns out to be about @xmath65 hz .    to switch between mot ( current only in the gradient coils ) and the gravito",
