    "the spectral fit to the comet galaxy head emission is consistent with the dense gas being quite cool . since the brighter ( higher density ) region has a cooler temperature , the discontinuity appears to be a cold front , which are often observed in clusters @xcite . in this subsection",
    ", we estimate the velocity of the comet galaxy from the stagnation condition at the cold front .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)f10.eps      for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the actual distance from the cluster center to the comet galaxy ( @xmath117 ) is the same as the projected distance ( @xmath118  kpc ) , which is the lower boundary of the possible range ( @xmath119  kpc ) . the icm density profile can be derived from the result of the single @xmath25 model fit for the fan - shaped @xmath103 region in section  [ sec : comet ] ( the second line of table  [ tab : beta ] ) , @xmath120^{-3 \\beta_1/2}\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath121 .",
    "the result of the fit is shown in figure  [ fig : front ] ( the solid line for @xmath122 ) .",
    "the density ahead of the galaxy is @xmath123 .",
    "for the temperature outside the galaxy , we use the temperature of the fan - shaped region , which is @xmath124  kev .",
    "the stagnation condition relates the pressure @xmath125 far in front of the cold front with the pressure @xmath126 at the stagnation point at the leading edge of the cold front . because of gradients in the overall cluster density , it is difficult to determine @xmath125 exactly , but it is likely to be smaller than the value determined from the product of @xmath127 and @xmath60 immediately in front of the comet galaxy .",
    "subtracting the emission around the galaxy , we found that the density inside the galaxy is almost constant at @xmath128 ( the solid line for @xmath129 in figure  [ fig : front ] ) .",
    "the temperature inside the comet galaxy is @xmath130  kev ( table  [ tab : sp ] ) .",
    "thus , the ratio of the stagnation pressure @xmath131 to the pressure far in front is at least @xmath132 .",
    "the stagnation condition depends on the mach number of the cold front relative to the upstream gas ( @xmath133 ) as : @xmath134 where @xmath135 ( = 5/3 ) is the adiabatic index @xcite .",
    "the resulting mach number and galaxy velocity are @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "since the values of @xmath117 and @xmath138 we adopted are the lower limits , the values of @xmath133 and @xmath139 are also the lower limits .",
    "ram - pressure stripping can have a strong influence on the evolution of galaxies in clusters @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the comet galaxy suggests that the galaxy is affected by ram - pressure stripping .",
    "a similar galaxy is found in a2125 @xcite .",
    "if the comet galaxy is at @xmath140 ( see section  [ sec : simple ] ) , the ram - pressure on the comet galaxy from the outside icm ( @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the mass density corresponding to @xmath127 ) is @xmath143 , based on the velocity derived above and the cluster gas density profile .",
    "the gas in the comet galaxy would be stripped when the ram - pressure becomes larger than the static pressure of the galaxy : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the mass density corresponding to @xmath146 , @xmath147 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath148 ( = 0.6 ) is the mean molecular weight , and @xmath149 is the proton mass @xcite .",
    "since @xmath150 , the comet galaxy marginally satisfies the condition  ( [ eq : ram ] ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider whether the gas around the comet galaxy can be supplied from the stars in the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath151band absolute magnitude of the comet galaxy is @xmath152 .",
    "since the stellar mass - loss rate per unit @xmath151band luminosity is given by @xmath153 @xcite , the total mass - loss rate of the comet galaxy is @xmath154 .",
    "since the mass of the gas in the comet galaxy ( the head of the comet ) is @xmath155 , the gas would be supplied by the stars over the time @xmath156  yr . the time - scale is marginally smaller than the age of the universe , and thus the gas could be supplied by the stars .",
    "however , we did not include the gas stripped from the comet galaxy in this estimate .",
    "assuming that the tail of the comet galaxy is roughly a cylinder with a radius of 16  kpc and the length of 71  kpc ( the tail region shown in figure  [ fig : region ] ) , the gas mass of the tail is @xmath157 , which is larger than @xmath158 . since the temperature of the tail is much smaller than that of the surrounding region ( @xmath22  kev ; table  [ tab : sp ] )",
    ", most of the gas came from the comet galaxy .",
    "this means that most of the gas around the comet galaxy ( head and tail ; @xmath159 ) did not originate in the stars in this galaxy at present day loss rates , although there is uncertainty of the mass loss rate expecially at the early phase of galaxy evolution .",
    "the comet galaxy probably was the central galaxy of a small cluster or group , and the gas around it probably originated as intracluster or intragroup medium .",
    "we note that the above conclusion does not depend on the assumed metal abundance of the gas in the head and tail of the galaxy ( @xmath160 ) . even if we assume that the metal abundance of the gas in the head and tail is higher than the surrounding gas and is @xmath161 , their gas masses are reduced by only @xmath162% .",
    "we also consider the case where the tail is clumpy . here",
    ", we assume that the tail is isothermal but consists of two different density gas , @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "the gas with density @xmath163 fills the volume @xmath165 and that with density @xmath164 filles the volume @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the total volume of the tail and @xmath168 is the parameter ( @xmath169 ) . if @xmath170 , the luminosity of the tail is given by @xmath171 .",
    "on the other hand , if we assume that the tail is uniform ( the density is @xmath172 and the mass is @xmath173 ) , the luminosity is represented by @xmath174 .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath175 , the density of the clumps is written as @xmath176 , and the mass of the clumpy tail is approximately given by @xmath177 .",
    "this means that if the tail is highly clumpy , the tail mass could be smaller than that derived above ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "however , such clumps would easily be destroyed through hydrodynamical interactions with the surrounding gas ( e.g. ) .      from the hardness ratio maps ( figure  [ fig : hr ] ) and surface brightness profiles ( figure  [ fig : surf ] ) , we know that the cool , dense interstellar medium ( ism ) of a2670 and a2107 is confined within 3  and 15  from the galaxy centers ( x - ray peaks ) , respectively .",
    "the pressure ratio at the boundary is @xmath179 for a2670 and @xmath180 for a2107 .",
    "thus the pressure is consistent with being continuous at the boundary .",
    "the allowable velocities derived from a stagnation condition ( equation  [ [ eq : vik01b ] ] ) are @xmath181 for a2670 and @xmath182 for a2107 .",
    "since these limits are still much larger than the observed radial peculiar velocities of the cds in their clusters ( @xmath183 for a2670 , and @xmath13 for a2107 ; ) , these limits are not very constraining .",
    "the ism masses are @xmath184 and @xmath185 for a2670 and a2107 , respectively . in this estimation",
    ", we assumed that the metal abundance of the ism is the same as the cluster average .",
    "if we assume that the metal abundance of the ism is @xmath85 as in the case of the comet galaxy , the ism masses are reduced by only @xmath186% , which does not affect the following discussion .",
    "the @xmath151band absolute luminosities of the cd galaxies are @xmath187 and @xmath188 for a2670 and a2107 , respectively . as we did for the comet galaxy ,",
    "we derive the time - scale for the stars in the cd galaxies to supply the ism . for a2670 , @xmath189  yr , and for a2107 , @xmath190  yr . the time - scales are smaller than or comparable to the typical age of a cluster ( @xmath19110  gyr ; e.g. ) . on the other hand ,",
    "only a small fraction of the stellar mass loss would occur within the small volume occupied by the cooler gas today .",
    "thus , stellar mass loss would only be adequate if the gas was ejected before the cd galaxies were located in their present environment , and the ism was compressed by the high icm pressure to its current small volume . in any case , the cooling times of the ism are @xmath192  yr for a2670 , and @xmath193  yr for a2107 .",
    "thus , while stars in the cd can marginally supply the ism before cooling becomes effective for a2670 , they can not for a2107 .",
    "for a2670 , the size of the ism region is comparable to those of ngc  4874 and 4889 in the coma cluster ( @xmath191  kpc ; ) .",
    "both a2670 and coma are merging clusters .",
    "thus , a compact ism may be common for merging clusters .",
    "for the two galaxies in coma , it has been shown that @xmath194 and some heating source is required to prevent radiative cooling @xcite . since @xmath195 , the ism of the cd galaxy in a2670",
    "may also be affected by the heating source .",
    "although the size of the ism region is larger ( 12  kpc ) , radiative cooling must be suppressed as well for a2107 ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "these observations show the similarity between ` cooling flow ' clusters and dynamically young merging clusters in terms of the necessity of some heating sources . for the dynamically young clusters , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are not good candidates for heating sources because agn jets would deposit their energy outside the small ism regions ( e.g. ) .",
    "thus , as discussed by @xcite , thermal conduction may be the heating source .",
    "in fact , the time - scales of the thermal conduction are short ; @xmath196  yr for a2670 , and @xmath197  yr for a2170 , which are derived using equation  ( 9 ) in fujita and goto ( 2004 ) .",
    "note that the saturation of thermal conduction is generally not important for cd galaxies because the electron density is high around them . since @xmath198",
    ", thermal conduction can supply enough energy to the ism . on the other hand , at least for a2107 , the ism structure seen in the surface brightness map ( figure  [ fig : cen]b ) and that seen in the hardness ratio map ( figure  [ fig : hr]b )",
    "are different .",
    "this indicates that the ism is not in pressure equilibrium , which may be due to the dynamical motion around the galaxy .",
    "cluster mergers may induce such motion , which may finally lead to turbulence and heat the cluster core through the turbulent mixing as is shown in the ` tsunami ' model @xcite .",
    "we present an analysis of chandra observations of the galaxy clusters a2670 and a2107 .",
    "the peculiar velocities of the cd galaxies are unusually large ( @xmath0 ) and the clusters are undergoing mergers . to the west of the cd galaxy of a2670 , we find a galaxy having a comet - like x - ray structure ( comet galaxy ) .",
    "the leading edge of the structure is a cold front . from the pressure profile across the cold front",
    ", we estimate the velocity of the galaxy in the cluster a2670 .",
    "the mass of x - ray gas in the comet - like structure is too large to have been produced by stellar mass loss within the galaxy itself .",
    "thus , it is likely that the galaxy was at the center of a small cluster or group , and that its intracluster or intragroup medium is being stripped by ram - pressure .",
    "the sizes of the cooler , x - ray interstellar medium ( ism ) regions of the cd galaxies in a2670 and a2107 are very small .",
    "this is similar to the brightest galaxies in the coma cluster , which is also a merging cluster .",
    "since the cooling time of the ism is small , there must be some heating sources in the galaxies .",
    "the compactness of the ism indicates that the heating sources are not the agns in the galaxies .",
    "we suggest thermal conduction or hydrodynamical heating by ` tsunamis ' as possible heat sources to balance the observed x - ray emission .",
