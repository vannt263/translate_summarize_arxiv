    "in addition the non - zero chiral term also suggests that at least unequally populated chiral domains are present in ndfe@xmath0(@xmath1bo@xmath0)@xmath2 .",

    "the calculated integrated intensities are given in table [ tab : chiral_scan_ints](a ) for the case of only a single chirality domain being populated .",
    "in addition we assumed only one orientation domain , similar as for the unpolarized results .",
    "for comparison we give the measured integrated intensities from the scans for the four polarization channels in table [ tab : chiral_scan_ints](b ) . due to the limited resolution of the setup the measured values for the individual polarization channels",
    "are integrated over both peaks and can not be compared directly to the calculations .",
    "this is especially true for the difference of the intensities .",
    "however , two reasonable assumptions can be made to allow for a comparison :    1 .",
    "the measured integrated intensity in the channel ` @xmath99 ' is only due to the peak at ( 0,0,0)-@xmath91 whereas the channel ` @xmath100 ' is only due to the peak at ( 0,0,-3)+@xmath91 . this assumption is justified as the measured points of each respective polarization channel ( red squares and blue circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral](a ) ) are shifted towards the direction of the corresponding peak .",
    "the channels ` @xmath101 ' and ` @xmath102 ' are equally contributed by both satellite reflections as they are centered on top of each other and between the other two channels ( black circles and green triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral](a ) ) .    based on these assumptions we are able to calculate the ratio @xmath103 = 28(4 ) for the intensities measured on the magnetic bragg reflection ( 0,0,-3)+@xmath91 . note that the division by 2 is due to assumption ( ii ) .",
    "the same ratio for the calculated intensities for this peak amounts to @xmath104  =  24 . for the satellite ( 0,0,0)-@xmath91 we obtain the measured ratio @xmath105 = 28(4 ) and the calculated ratio @xmath106 = 24",
    "this indicates that our model of a long - period antiferromagnetic helix propagating along the hexagonal @xmath9-axis with the magnetic moments parallel to the hexagonal basal plane and single chirality domain is in good agreement with our data .",
    "+ in addition we verified our assumptions by performing a convolution of the calculated integrated intensities for each of the four polarization channels ( cf .",

    "the results of the simulations are the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral](a ) . to match the intensity a single scale factor four all four polarization channels was introduced in the calculation .",
    "similar as for the previous calculations the simulation was performed with only one of the two chiral domains being populated , and a single orientation domain .",
    "the solid line in fig .  [ fig : chiral](b ) was obtained by summating the individual curves for each polarization channel with respect to eq .  .",
    "the peculiar shape of difference curve is due to the slightly asymmetric shape of the magnetic satellite peaks .",
    "after the asymmetric peak shape was taken account for within the simulation good agreement between simulation and experimental data was achieved .",
    "the present single - crystal neutron diffraction investigations did not detect significant deviations from space group _ r32 _ concerning the chemical structure of multiferroic ndfe@xmath0(@xmath1bo@xmath0)@xmath2 at low temperatures .",
    "with respect to magnetic ordering this study shows that only the magnetic model ( m1a ) is in agreement with our polarized neutron data on the noncentrosymmetric ndfe@xmath0(@xmath1bo@xmath0)@xmath2 .",
    "+ however , in contrast to the previous neutron powder diffraction study of ndfe@xmath0(@xmath1bo@xmath0)@xmath2@xcite , we may conclude from our combined investigation with unpolarized and polarized neutrons that in addition , ferromagnetic alignment of the magnetic fe and nd sublattices holds .",
    "this implies low magnetic symmetry such as _ r12 _ ( monoclinic _ c2 _ ) in the commensurate phase .",
    "our conclusion is further supported by measurements of the magnetic susceptibility by tristan et al.@xcite that yield an easy magnetization along the @xmath34-axis .",
    "in addition , we should emphasize that not only fe@xmath12 , but also the nd@xmath12 ions show antiferromagnetic long - range order below the nel temperature in case of neodymium ferroborate . + concerning the incommensurate phase the polarized @xmath21-scans over the positions of the magnetic peaks",
    "could be well explained via the magnetic model ( m1a ) that was found for the commensurate phase simply by introducing the incommensurate propagation vector @xmath91 .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic structure transforms into a long - period antiferromagnetic helix that propagates along the hexagonal @xmath9-axis with the magnetic moments perpendicular to it .",
    "the incommensurate magnetic propagation vector @xmath91 = [ 0 , 0 , @xmath22 + @xmath27 ] is therefore associated with a rotation of the magnetic moments about 180@xmath107 + @xmath108 around the @xmath9-axis between adjacent hexagonal planes that are interrelated via trigonal translations .",
    "the measured value of the splitting @xmath27 = 0.00667 corresponds to @xmath108  @xmath4  0.8@xmath107 and the full period of the helix amounts to approximately 1140   .",
    "the mere observation of a chiral contribution by means of polarization analysis signifies unequally populated chirality domains .",
    "our data further suggest that only one of the two chirality domains is populated .",
    "the antiferromagnetic helix in the ic phase of ndfe@xmath0(@xmath1bo@xmath0)@xmath2 therefore exists with an unique handedness .",
    "a single chirality domain is in principle not expected , since left- and right - handed spirals are energetically degenerate , however in the case of ndfe@xmath0(@xmath1bo@xmath0)@xmath2 this might be related to the fact that the chemical structure is non - centrosymmetric .",
    "this is similar to the magnetic spirals in mnsi or uptge@xcite , and the more recent example ba@xmath0nbfe@xmath0si@xmath6o@xmath8@xcite that all three possess no inversion symmetry .",
    "in particular the jana2006 analysis has shown that in addition the incommensurate magnetic structure exists in a single magnetic orientation domain with full superspace group symmetry _",
    "r32(00@xmath108)t0 _ and in full agreement with the polarized results .",
    "+ the determined saturation value of the magnetic fe moment of approximately 4.2  @xmath109 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : magmom ] ) is less than 5  @xmath109 which would be expected for a free fe@xmath110 ion , in contrast to our previous powder results@xcite .",
    "moreover , the ferromagnetic alignment of the fe and nd magnetic moments implies considerably smaller magnitudes for nd than derived from the powder diffraction data .",
    "the latter are not affected by extinction .",
    "the difference may be to a certain extent due to the extinction effects , as the even smaller saturation value of fe in case of thermal neutrons is caused by the considerably larger extinction , compared to hot neutrons . on the other hand , for tbfe@xmath0(@xmath1bo@xmath0)@xmath2 at 2 k , ritter at al . determined by means of powder neutron diffraction an antiparallel alignment of the fe and tb magnetic moments with ordered magnitudes @xmath111",

    "despite the bondvalence result @xmath113 for fe derived by these authors , the ordered fe magnetic moment is also reduced .",
    "hence , another possible reason could be frustration effects , yielding partially disordered magnetic moments .",
    "+ furthermore , the observation of third order harmonics of the magnetic satellites at the positions ( 0 , 0 , 3/2 @xmath114 3@xmath27 ) in the incommensurate phase additionally suggest the formation of a magnetic soliton lattice in ndfe@xmath0(@xmath1bo@xmath0)@xmath2@xcite .",
    "a soliton is the appearance of localized or topological defects in periodic structures due to the presence of non - linear forces .",
    "such non - linear forces can be due to an external magnetic field that interacts with the magnetic moments or due to magnetic anisotropy as shown theoretically by izyumov and laptev@xcite .",
    "indeed ndfe@xmath0(@xmath1bo@xmath0)@xmath2 exhibits magnetic anisotropy in the hexagonal basal plane as demonstrated by the results of tristan et al.@xcite .",
    "the calculation of izyumov and laptev is based on a magnetic helix that forms due to the the presence of the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction ( dmi ) . until now no explicit statement about the existence of the dmi in ndfe@xmath0(@xmath1bo@xmath0)@xmath2 has been made .",
    "however , as ndfe@xmath0(@xmath1bo@xmath0)@xmath2 is non - centrosymmetric the presence of the dmi is allowed from symmetry .",
    "therefore , the formation of the observed magnetic helix is possibly driven by the dmi . +",
    "in figs .",
    "[ fig : nd_second_order_sats ] ( b ) to ( d ) we see that the intensities of the second order satellites are highest for temperatures t  @xmath115  13.5  k and the distortions of the incommensurate periodic structures seem to be largest near to the c - ic phase transition .",
    "we therefore assume that at t@xmath5 the interaction that favors a magnetic order that is incommensurate with respect to the underlying crystal lattice becomes non - negligible and leads to non - linear forces onto the magnetic subsystem slightly below t@xmath5 as it still wants to remain in its commensurate magnetic order . within a small temperature regime below",
    "t@xmath5 the magnetic structure consequently is not yet completely incommensurate but can be rather viewed as a distorted commensurate magnetic structure with domain walls .",
    "alternating periods of commensurate parts and domains walls then lead to the observed third order harmonics .",
    "the observation of a magnetic soliton lattice without the application of external forces like magnetic fields or mechanical stress are rather unlikely and to the best of our knowledge the only other compound for which a magnetic soliton lattice was reported without the application of an external magnetic field is cub@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the observed temperature dependence of the propagation vector is continuous and described by eq .  .",
    "this behavior is close to @xmath116 reported in ref .  .",
    "in addition , similar to cub@xmath6o@xmath2 the commensurate phase is realized when the temperature is increased , which is in contradiction to the prediction of the theory @xcite . for cub@xmath6o@xmath2",
    "it was proposed that the difference to the theory can be explained by assuming that the change of the propagation vector is not due to a temperature dependent magnetic anisotropy as in ref .",
    "but rather due to the magnitude of the dmi that decreases as a function of increasing temperature  @xcite .",
    "we assume that is is similarly true for ndfe@xmath0(@xmath1bo@xmath0)@xmath2 . in summary our experimental results",
    "are well described by the assumption of a magnetic soliton lattice .",
    "+ the origin of the less pronounced incommensurability in case of the small crystal studied ( sample2 ) in the present work , compared to the larger one ( sample1 ) that was also used in ref .  , is not yet clear and should be clarified by future systematic investigations of possible sample dependencies .",

    "our polarized neutron diffraction data further suggests that the helix is monochiral , i.e. only one of the two possible chiral domains is fully populated .",
