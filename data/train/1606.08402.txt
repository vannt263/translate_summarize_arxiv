    "the meson @xmath18 , the heaviest ground state of an open flavor meson , is unique in the sense that both the constituent quarks are heavy and can decay with comparable lifetimes , and both @xmath0 and @xmath19 decay channels have been observed @xcite .",
    "the excited state @xmath20 decays promptly to the ground state by a photon emission and then follows the usual decay pattern .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 decays ( leading to @xmath21 ) are more favored than the @xmath19 decays ( leading to @xmath22 and other charmonia ) because the latter is suppressed by the ckm factor @xmath23 , which more than offsets the parent quark mass factor @xmath24 . about 70% of the @xmath1 mesons decay via @xmath0 while only 20% of them decay via @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the annihilation channel @xmath25 is not expected to contribute more than 10% . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath26 bound states are easier to reconstruct and that is why most of the experimental studies are focussed on them .",
    "however , there are theoretical studies on the @xmath27 decays available in the literature @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 decays are important for several reasons .",
    "the decays will test , and possibly differentiate among , different form factor ( ff ) models @xcite . depending on the ffs chosen",
    ", the branching ratios ( br ) can vary by a factor of 5 to 7 .",
    "for example , the br for @xmath2 can vary over a range of @xmath29\\%$ ] . apart from differentiating among various ff models ,",
    "@xmath21 decays are also the unique testing ground for the effects of a heavy spectator quark .    in 2013 ,",
    "the lhcb collaboration observed the decay @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 , in turn , was reconstructed through its hadronic decays @xmath8 and @xmath31 , followed by @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the vector decay modes like @xmath35 or @xmath36 were treated as pollutants where the soft pion or photon coming from the decay of the vector mesons was not reconstructed .",
    "once the @xmath30 was successfully reconstructed , it was combined with the pion coming at the first stage of the cascade to get the parent @xmath1 .",
    "note that @xmath1 can also decay to @xmath4 , which decays almost with a 100% br to @xmath37 .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath38 is , however , not very precisely known at the lhc with @xmath39 tev .",
    "while the other fragmentation functions are more or less well - measured , like @xmath40 , the @xmath1 production cross - section @xmath41 depends crucially on the masses of the @xmath42 and the @xmath43 quarks .",
    "for example , at @xmath44 tev at the lhc , @xmath41 can vary from 28.9 nb to 75.6 nb , for @xmath45 gev and @xmath46 $ ] gev @xcite .",
    "a similar variation is there if one varies @xmath47 , which is justifiable from the point that the running @xmath42-quark mass is between 2.5 and 3.0 gev at the production level because of the higher energy scale involved , whereas for the decay , one should use a higher value of @xmath47 close to 5 gev .",
    "this normalization uncertainty , unfortunately , prevents a precise differentiation among the ff models . to overcome this , at least partially",
    ", it is imperative to detect the @xmath27 decay , and the subsequent decay of @xmath30 , through other final states .    in this paper , we will try to focus on a slightly different cascade decay of @xmath1 , leading to a @xmath48 , a charged pion , a charged lepton , and missing @xmath49 ( from the neutrino ) in the final state .",
    "this may or may not be accompanied by one or more photons . the presence of the charged lepton helps to make such events relatively clean .",
    "the final state can originate through two distinct chains : @xmath50 note that we have not shown the electric charges . without any @xmath51 oscillation ,",
    "the lepton and the pion would have opposite charges , but the oscillation being quite fast , same sign and opposite sign @xmath52 pairs come out with almost equal probability . we have also not shown the vector excitations , like @xmath53 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 , or @xmath5 .",
    "the excitations , in general , come down to the pseudoscalar ground states by emitting a pion , if energetically possible , or a photon .",
    "most of the times these pions and photons are so soft as to go undetected .",
    "an exception is the decay @xmath54 followed by @xmath55 . the first decay being close to the kinematic threshold , the @xmath6 meson and hence the pions tend to be soft , so one may catch the charged pion and miss the neutral one .",
    "it is not easy to remove this channel through a mass reconstruction because of the smearing effect in the reconstructed @xmath1 peak ; thus , this will be a part of the signal , as we discuss later .",
    "events where one sees one or two photons coming out of the @xmath56 are vetoed out .",
    "naively , we expect many more events in chain 2 than in chain 1 .",
    "the reason is that the three - body decay in the first stage of chain 1 makes the charged lepton much softer compared to the @xmath57 in chain 2 , and so the chance of missing the lepton after applying the @xmath9 cuts is quite high .",
    "we itemize below the motivations for studying the decay cascade of @xmath1 via @xmath30 involving a lepton :    * with a better knowledge of the cascade stage from which the pion is coming , one may pin down the ff models more precisely . for example , the relative importance of @xmath2 and @xmath58 depends crucially on the ffs chosen .",
    "an example will be given in the next section .",
    "thus , the irreducible contribution of @xmath58 on @xmath2 is a function of the ffs chosen , and with enough data and a clean atmosphere , the momentum distribution of the charged pion may help in differentiating among such models , as we will show later .",
    "the caveat is that the theoretical uncertainties are yet too high . * with a lepton in the final state , which is theoretically much cleaner , it should give us a handle on the non - negligible @xmath59 effects in the decay , as the @xmath60 corrections are less severe .",
    "* this might turn out to be a good strategy for the future b factories like kek - b , which will provide a much cleaner environment and can also help in the study of possible decay distributions and angular correlations of the decay products .",
    "if we can somehow reconstruct @xmath4 , we will have more information on several other ffs too .",
    "the angular correlation between the pion and the lepton may shed light to possible new physics operators present in the decay . *",
    "if we have only one pion in the signal , one may use other decay modes of @xmath48 to reconstruct it , with better efficiency , for example @xmath61 or @xmath62 , although the br of the latter mode is much smaller than the other two decay channels .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we outline the essential tools for the analysis , while the actual analysis is performed in section 3 . in the last section ,",
    "we summarize and conclude .",
    "at the lhc , the production cross - section @xmath41 is of the order of tens of nb , and depends crucially on the charm fragmentation function @xmath63 .",
    "the total cross - section is a sum of the production cross - sections of @xmath1 ( @xmath64 ) , @xmath53 ( @xmath65 ) , and other higher excited states .",
    "typical cross - sections for various choices of @xmath47 and @xmath66 are shown in ref .",
    "we have used the code bcvegpyv2 @xcite to calculate the production of @xmath1 . with @xmath67 gev , @xmath68 gev , @xmath69 gev , and the factorization scale @xmath70 where @xmath9 is the transverse momentum of @xmath1 ,",
    "the production cross - section is @xmath71 nb .",
    "this includes the production of @xmath1 , @xmath53 , and some higher resonances , including color - octet @xmath1 states .",
    "as they all decay promptly to the ground state @xmath1 by emitting a photon or a gluon , one must take all of them into account .",
    "the gluon distribution function used is cteq5l .",
    "one must note that @xmath41 depends on the values of @xmath47 and @xmath66 , and this normalization uncertainty will be inherent in any estimate of the number of events .",
    "let us not go into a discussion of any specific theoretical framework ; we would refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a comparative list of different ff models . as is well - known",
    ", the decay @xmath27 involves two ffs : b_s(p ) | v_| b_c ( p)= q_f_0(q^2 ) + \\ { ( p+p)_- q _ } f_1(q^2 ) , which are equal at zero momentum transfer , @xmath72 , with @xmath73 . however , their forms depend on the model chosen to evaluate them .",
    "similarly , @xmath74 is parametrized by four ffs : b_s^(p , ) |",
    "v_| b_c ( p)&= & _ ^ p^^ , + b_s^(p , ) | a_| b_c ( p)&= & i^ .    to show the model dependence",
    ", one may mention that @xmath75 for @xmath27 can be as low as @xmath76 in relativistic constituent quark model @xcite or as high as @xmath77 in qcd sum rule based models @xcite .",
    "the decay width typically goes as the square of @xmath78 and can vary by a factor of 6 .",
    "however , it is not just a question of simple scaling .",
    "for example , let us take two typical approaches , based on qcd factorization @xcite and perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "the br of @xmath2 is @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) in the former ( latter ) approach , while the br for @xmath58 is @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this variation is simply due to the individual ff evaluations in these two models .",
    "while we have not shown the sizable uncertainties in these predictions , it is clear that the data , with more precision and a better knowledge of @xmath1 production cross - section ( which essentially is an overall normalization ) , potentially have the ability to differentiate between the ff models .",
    "we simulate @xmath1 production and its subsequent decays by pythiav6.4.28 @xcite coupled with bcvegpyv2.2 @xcite .",
    "our analysis is in the context of the lhcb detector .",
    "as we have mentioned , the production cross - section at lhc operating with @xmath39 tev is 334 nb , including the production of all kinematically allowed higher resonances . the latter promptly decay to the ground state , namely , @xmath83 .",
    "we demand a pseudorapidity @xmath84 for @xmath1 and all subsequent particles produced in the cascade .    for both the decay chains 1 and 2",
    ", we have the same final state of one charged lepton , one charged pion , one @xmath48 , and missing energy , which we will call the @xmath85 final state .",
    "the @xmath48 is detected primarily through the channel @xmath86 with detection efficiency @xmath87 , and this channel also has a large br , about @xmath88 .",
    "this final state involves one less pion than the conventional @xmath2 , @xmath8 cascade , so one can possibly use @xmath89 channel too , although this channel is cabibbo - suppressed .",
    "we select the @xmath57 and @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 = @xmath92 ) with @xmath93 and @xmath94 gev originating from @xmath30 and @xmath1 for chain 1 and from @xmath1 and @xmath30 for chain 2 respectively . for @xmath56 and @xmath95 that may come from the vector excitations , we keep the same rapidity cut but choose @xmath96 mev @xcite .",
    "the events containing at least one photon coming from the decay of @xmath56 are vetoed .",
    "apart from the major detection channel for @xmath48 , namely , @xmath86 , it can also be detected through channels like @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the typical detection efficiency @xmath99 is about 80 - 90% @xcite in the former mode and that is what we will use in the analysis .",
    "the mass can be reconstructed from the decay products with an accuracy of almost 1% .",
    "pion detection efficiency is 93% and muon detection efficiency is 97% , with about 1 - 3% probability of misidentifying a muon as a pion .",
    "for momentum measurement , @xmath100 uncertainty is a conservative estimate ; at lower energy , it goes down to @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath30 goes to a muon ( which are much easier to detect than the electrons ) , @xmath9 of muon must be greater than 1.48 gev . for hadronic decays ,",
    "a hadron is required in the calorimeter with @xmath102 gev .",
    "we also use @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath104 can also contribute to the same final state if the neutral pion is not detected or missed at the detector .",
    "@xmath56 can be detected from the diphoton invariant mass distribution where @xmath105 is required to be @xmath106 @xmath107 ( @xmath108 25 ) mev .",
    "the photons are demanded to have @xmath109 200 mev .",
    "the @xmath9 cut on @xmath56 or photons removes about 62% of the events coming from intermediate vector excitations .",
    "the rest add up to the signal events . while a detailed discussion on @xmath56 detection is available in ref .",
    "@xcite , we take the detection efficiency to be 100% .    for the signal ,",
    "we find , expectedly , that the @xmath9 cuts on leptons and charged pions remove most of the events , because at least one of the particles is soft enough . for @xmath110 , about 2.4% of all events survive , while for @xmath58 , this is only 0.82% .",
    "the latter further reduces to 0.31% after applying the @xmath9 cuts on @xmath56 and/or photons .",
    "the distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptdist ] .",
    "the number of events passing all the cuts with an integrated luminosity of 20 fb@xmath111 , @xmath1 production cross - section of 334 nb , and pqcd ffs , are as follows : b_cb_s&= & 514 + b_cb_s&= & 29473 + b_cb_s&= & 4603 .",
    "this implies , as is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptdist ] , that the observed kinematics is essentially that coming from chain 2 .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptdist ] for an integrated luminosity of @xmath112 fb@xmath111 , based on the pqcd ffs .",
    "the right - hand plots are with all the cuts applied , including the photon veto to remove the identifiable @xmath113 events .",
    "the numbers are only for chain 2 ; the correction from chain 1 is about 1% after all the cuts are applied , because the lepton coming from a three - body decay of @xmath1 is too soft to be detectable most of the times .    the model dependence of the pion or lepton distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] .",
    "we have shown the distributions with two ff models , namely , pqcd and qcdf . while the total number of events are quite different , the shapes are almost identical , except that for pqcd , the number of comparatively softer pions is slightly more .",
    "one must mention that the numbers depend on the @xmath1 production cross - section , which in turn depends on @xmath63 , the @xmath1 fragmentation function .",
    "as the latter can vary over a wide range , depending on the values of @xmath47 and @xmath66 chosen , one can differentiate among various ff models if the production cross - section , which acts as an overall normalization , can somehow be fixed .",
    "in this paper we have tried to show the possible advantages of looking at the @xmath0 decay in the @xmath1 meson through the cascade @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "this should act as an alternative channel to the cascade where both @xmath1 and @xmath30 decay to pions .",
    "once the @xmath1 production cross - section is fixed , the @xmath9 distribution of the charged pion ( now that there is no confusion from which stage of the cascade it is coming ) and the lepton should allow us to guess the relative weightage of different decay channels , and hence the corresponding form factors .    the efficacy of using the channel suggested here , with the appropriate event selection criteria , depends crucially on the normalization of the @xmath1 pair production rate .",
    "this involves the @xmath1 fragmentation function which in turn is highly sensitive to @xmath47 and @xmath66 .",
    "independent methods of pinning down the uncertainties in this sector will thus be extremely helpful in improving our understanding of @xmath1 decay dynamics .",
