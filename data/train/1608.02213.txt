    "transition metal based antiferromagnetism ( afm ) can be considered to be a necessary , but clearly not sufficient , ingredient for high temperature superconductivity in both the cuo- and fe - based superconductors . when long - range afm can be suppressed by either substitution or pressure in these systems superconductivity emerges , often with remarkably high transition temperatures and upper critical fields .",

    "<S> systematic measurements of temperature dependent magnetization , resistivity and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) at ambient pressure as well as resistivity under pressures up to 5.25 gpa were conducted on single crystals of craute@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> magnetization data suggest that magnetic moments are aligned antiferromagnetically along the crystallographic @xmath1-axis below @xmath2 = 255k . </S>",
    "<S> arpes measurements show band reconstruction due to the magnetic ordering . </S>",
    "<S> magnetoresistance data show clear anisotropy , and , at high fields , quantum oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the neel temperature decreases monotonically under pressure , decreasing to @xmath2 = 236k at 5.22gpa . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure dependencies of ( i ) @xmath2 , ( ii ) the residual resistivity ratio , and ( iii ) the size and power - law behavior of the low temperature magnetoresistance all show anomalies near 2gpa suggesting that there may be a phase transition ( structural , magnetic , and/or electronic ) induced by pressure . for pressures higher than 2gpa </S>",
    "<S> a significantly different quantum oscillation frequency emerges , consistent with a pressure induced change in the electronic states . </S>"
