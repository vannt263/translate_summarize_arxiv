    "the goal of this paper is to compute all the central configurations and the dimension of the stable / unstable manifolds for the dihedral symmetric @xmath7-body problem in space under the action of a homogeneous potential of degree @xmath5 . for the newtonian potential",
    "this problem is a kind of generalisation of devaney planar isosceles three body problem @xcite.the dihedral problem is a special case of the full @xmath7-body problem which reduces to a hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom .",
    "briefly , one takes @xmath0 equal masses whose initial position and velocity are symmetric with respect to the dihedral group of rotations @xmath8 .",
    "so the masses form a ( possibly degenerate and non - regular ) antiprism in space ( and they are vertices of two symmetric parallel @xmath9-gons ) . because of the symmetry of the problem",
    ", the masses will remain in such a configuration for all time .",
    "hence we have a system with only three degrees of freedom . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the four bodies are at vertices of a tetrahedron , and the problem has been studied in a series of papers by delgado and vidal @xcite .",
    "the main tool is the use of mcgehee coordinates introduced in @xcite but for a general homogeneous potential of degree @xmath5 .",
    "we replace the singularity due to total collapse with an invariant immersed manifold in the full phase space usually called _ total collision manifold _ which is the immersion of the parabolic manifold of the projected phase space .",
    "we explicitly compute all central configurations for this problem and show that just three types can arise : a planar regular @xmath2-gon , a regular @xmath9-gonal prism and a @xmath9-gonal anti - prism . the motivation in order to study this kind of problem is twofold . from one side",
    "this problem is difficult enough to put on evidence some chaotic behaviour of the full @xmath7-body problem and at the same time it is simple enough to carry out some explicit computations . from the other side",
    "the interest in this kind of problem is due to the fact that it includes a lot of other problems with two or three degrees of freedom studied in the past decades .",
    "the literature is quite broad and we limit ourself to quote only some closest results ; among the others is the tetrahedral four body problem without and with rotation , studied respectively in @xcite and @xcite , the rectangular four body problem studied by sim and lacomba in @xcite .",

    "we define the _ parabolic manifold _ as the projection of all zero - energy orbits ( or , equivalently , of the zero - energy submanifold of @xmath57 ) in @xmath58 , that is @xmath59 its dimension is @xmath60 .",

    "moreover , the _ equilibrium points _ in [ eq : mcghee3 ] are the projections of the equilibrium points of [ eq : mcghee1 ] ( and the projection is one - to - one in the parabolic manifold ) , which can be found as solutions of @xmath91 hence all equilibrium points belong to the parabolic manifold @xmath65 . the constant solution in a central configuration @xmath92 with @xmath93",
