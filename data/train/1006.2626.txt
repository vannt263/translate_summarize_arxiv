    "<S> an effective @xmath9 interaction is constructed so as to reproduce , within the @xmath10 three - body model , the @xmath11 of @xmath12he , which was extracted from the emulsion experiment , the nagara event . with no adjustable parameters for the @xmath2 system , @xmath11 of the ground and bound excited states of @xmath1be </S>",

    "<S> the hida event , recently observed at kek - e373 experiment , is interpreted as an observation of the ground state of the @xmath1be .    </S>",
    "<S> 15 pt    in nuclear physics involving strangeness , the fundamental problem is to describe the different facets of the interactions among the baryon octet in a unified way . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to reveal various features of hyperon(@xmath13)-nucleon(@xmath14 ) and @xmath15 interactions through combined analyses for two- and many - body hyperonic systems . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath16 interaction models have been constructed so far by utilizing various @xmath0 hypernuclear data to complement the limited @xmath16 scattering data . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 interaction is an important entry into the @xmath17 baryon - baryon interactions , decisive information about which is obtained from observations of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei and their separation energies for two @xmath0 s separated from a double-@xmath0 hypernucleus , denoted as @xmath11 .    in the kek - e176/e373 hybrid emulsion experiments , there were observed several events corresponding to double-@xmath0 hypernuclei . among them </S>",
    "<S> was the epoch - making observation of the nagara event , which was identified uniquely as @xmath18he in the ground state with a precise value of @xmath19 mev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a second important observation was the demachi - yanagi event  @xcite identified as @xmath20be with @xmath21 mev values of nagara and demachi - yamanagi events are given as @xmath22 mev and @xmath23 mev in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in ref.@xcite , however , the e176/373 emulsion events have been reanalyzed by using the new @xmath24 mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their newly - obtained values of @xmath11 for these events are shown in the text . ] though it was uncertain whether this event was interpreted to be the ground state or an excited state .    </S>",
    "<S> a newly observed double-@xmath0 event has been recently reported , called the hida event @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this event has two possible interpretations : one is @xmath25 with @xmath26 mev , and the other is @xmath27 with @xmath28 mev . </S>",
    "<S> it is uncertain whether this is an observation of a ground state or an excited state .    in the planned experiments at j - parc </S>",
    "<S> , dozens of emulsion events for double-@xmath0 hypernuclei will be produced . in emulsion experiments , however , it is difficult to determine the spin - parity or even to know whether an observed event corresponds to a ground or excited state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is vitally important to compare the emulsion data with theoretical analyses to obtain a proper interpretation . in order to interpret the demachi - yanagi event , we studied in ref.@xcite the @xmath29be hypernucleus within the framework of the @xmath30 four - body cluster model , where the @xmath9 interaction was taken consistently with the nagara event . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated value for the @xmath31 state was in good agreement with the observed data . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the demachi - yanagi event is interpreted as an observation of the @xmath31 excited state of @xmath29be .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to interpret the new hida event on the basis of our theoretical study , adapting the method used for interpreting the demachi - yanagi event . at present </S>",
    "<S> , the hida event has two possible interpretations : @xmath1be and @xmath32be . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we assume this event is a @xmath1be hypernucleus . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable to employ an @xmath2 five - body model for the study of @xmath1be , because , as mentioned above , the interpretation of the demachi - yanagi event for @xmath29be was possible on the basis of an @xmath30 four - body cluster model , and @xmath1be is composed of @xmath29be plus one additional neutron . </S>",
    "<S> we further note that the core nucleus @xmath33be is well described by using an @xmath4 three - cluster model @xcite , and , therefore , it should be possible to model the structure change of @xmath33be due to the addition of the two @xmath0 particles as a five - body problem . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 five - body cluster model employed in this paper is quite challenging as a numerical computation , because of the following conditions : ( 1 ) there exist three species of particles ( @xmath34 , @xmath0 , and neutron ) , ( 2 ) five different kinds of interactions ( @xmath0-@xmath0 , @xmath0-neutron , @xmath0-@xmath34 , neutron-@xmath34 , and @xmath34-@xmath34 ) are involved , ( 3 ) one must take into account the pauli principle between the two @xmath34 particles and between the @xmath34 and neutron . </S>",
    "<S> we have succeeded in developing our gaussian expansion method @xcite , used in the above mentioned study of @xmath29be , in order to perform this five - body cluster - model calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized , before going to the five - body calculation , that all the interactions are determined so as to reproduce the observed binding energies of the two- and three - body subsystems ( @xmath3 , @xmath35 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath10 , and @xmath36 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then calculated the energies of the @xmath37 four - body subsystems , @xmath38be ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath29be ( @xmath40 ) , and found that they are simultaneously reproduced with no additional adjustable parameters needed . </S>",
    "<S> we are then able to calculate both the ground and excited states of @xmath1be with no free parameter . on the basis of careful calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we shall show that the recently reported hida event can be considered to be an observation of the ground state of @xmath1be .    in order to take into account the full five - body degrees of freedom of the @xmath2 system and the full correlations among all the constituent five particles </S>",
    "<S> , we describe the total wave function , @xmath41 , as a function of the _ entire _ 35 sets of jacobi coordinates @xmath42 in which the two @xmath0 s ( two @xmath34 s ) have been antisymmetrized ( symmetrized ) . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , the radial shapes of the basis function @xmath56 are taken to be gaussians with ranges postulated to lie in a geometric progression and similarly for @xmath57 and @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion coefficients @xmath59 and the eigenenergy @xmath60 of the total wave function @xmath41 are determined by solving the five - body schrdinger equation using the rayleigh - ritz variational method .    in the present @xmath2 five - body model for @xmath1be , </S>",
    "<S> it is absolutely necessary that any subcluster systems composed of the two , three , or four constituent particles are reasonably described by taking the interactions among these systems . in our previous work on double @xmath0 hypernuclei with @xmath61 within the framework of the @xmath62 four - body cluster model ( @xmath63 , and @xmath34 ) @xcite , the @xmath34-@xmath64-@xmath65-@xmath66-@xmath55 , and @xmath0-@xmath0 interactions </S>",
    "<S> were determined so as to reproduce well the following observed quantities : ( i ) energies of the low - lying states and scattering phase shifts in the @xmath35 and @xmath3 systems , ( ii ) @xmath0-binding energies @xmath67 in @xmath68he ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath70he ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath72be ( @xmath73 ) , ( iii ) double-@xmath0 binding energies @xmath11 in @xmath12he @xmath74 ) , the nagara event . </S>",
    "<S> we then predicted , with no more adjustable parameters , the energy level of @xmath29be ( @xmath75 ) , and found that , as mentioned before , the demachi - yanagi event was an observation of the @xmath31 excited state of @xmath29be .    in the present five - body calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the interactions of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite so that those severe constraints are also successfully met in our two- , three- , and four - body subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> but , the present core nucleus @xmath33be @xmath76 does not belong to the subsystems studied previously . </S>",
    "<S> since use of the same @xmath3 and @xmath35 interactions does not precisely reproduce the energies of the low - lying states of @xmath33be measured from the @xmath4 threshold ( the same difficulty is seen in another microscopic @xmath4 cluster - model study @xcite ) , we introduce an additional phenomenological @xmath4 three - body force with a gaussian shape , @xmath77 , having @xmath78 fm , @xmath79 fm and @xmath80 for the negative - parity ( positive - parity ) state so as to fit the observed energies of the @xmath81 ground state and the @xmath82 and @xmath83 excited states in @xmath33be . for the latter three resonance states , the same bound - state approximation ( namely , diagonalization of the hamiltonian with the @xmath84-integrable basis functions ) was applied . simultaneously , we found that the calculated @xmath67 of the ground state @xmath85 of @xmath86 reproduced well the observed value .    in order to reproduce the observed @xmath87 mev for @xmath88 </S>",
    "<S> , we tuned the @xmath9 interaction \\{eq.(3.6 ) in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite } by multiplying the strength of the @xmath89 part by a factor 1.244 . as for @xmath90 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained @xmath91 mev and @xmath92 mev , which explain , respectively , the demachi - yanagi event for the @xmath93 state ( @xmath94 mev ) and the data of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the ground state ( @xmath95 mev ; see table 5 of ref.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the above successful check of the energies of the subsystems encourages us to perform the five - body calculation of @xmath25 with no adjustable parameter , expecting high reliability for the result .    in fig .  2 , convergence of the calculated energy of the @xmath96 ground state of @xmath1be </S>",
    "<S> is illustrated with increasing number of five - body basis functions @xmath44 in eq.(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy is measured from the five - body breakup threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest threshold is @xmath97 , located at @xmath98 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the most important configuration in the ground - state wave function is found to be of the @xmath99 type , namely the configuration described by using the jacobi - coordinate sets @xmath100 in fig .  1 ; here , @xmath101 denotes the @xmath4 three - body degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the energy point ( a ) is obtained by taking @xmath102 configuration in fig.1 , the point ( b ) is obtained by @xmath102 and @xmath103 and the point ( c ) is obtained by @xmath102 to 4 . the additional @xmath104-mev energy gain from point ( c ) to ( d ) is obtained by including the configurations of the @xmath105 type described with the jacobi coordinates such as @xmath106 and @xmath107 , in which @xmath108 stands for the @xmath6 degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> another @xmath109-mev gain from point ( d ) down to the converged value ( @xmath110 mev with the accuracy of 10 kev totally with @xmath111 basis functions ) is achieved by including all the other types of configurations such as @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ground state is found to be bound by 5.1 mev below the lowest threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the angular momentum space of @xmath116 was found to be sufficient to obtain convergence for the energy .    </S>",

    "<S> the possibility of nuclear - core shrinkage due to a @xmath0-particle addition was originally pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by using the @xmath122 three - cluster model ( @xmath63 , and @xmath34 ) for @xmath123-shell @xmath0 hypernuclei . as for the hypernucleus @xmath124li , the prediction of some 20%-shrinkage , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and in an updated calculation  @xcite , was actually confirmed by experiment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as far as @xmath123-shell double-@xmath0 hypernuclei are concerned , the present authors found @xcite , using an @xmath125 model , that participation of the second @xmath0 particle can induce a further @xmath126% reduction in the distance between the @xmath34 and @xmath127 in the nuclear core . </S>",
    "<S> for the present five - body @xmath2 system , @xmath1be , table i shows the r.m.s . </S>",

    "<S> a reduction of those distances is about 20% , whereas the adding a second @xmath0 reduces the distances by about 6% ; this is similar to the case of double @xmath0 hypernuclei studied with the @xmath125 four - body model @xcite .    finally , let us discuss the energy spectra of @xmath1be and its relation to the hida event . </S>",
    "<S> using the same framework and interactions as those in the @xmath96 ground state , we calculated energies and wave functions of the @xmath129 , @xmath83 and @xmath130 states of @xmath1be ; there is no other bound state below the lowest @xmath131 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the energy level is illustrated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> interestingly enough , the order of the @xmath132 and @xmath133 states is reversed from @xmath33be to @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the energy gain due to the addition of the @xmath0-particle(s ) is larger in the compactly coupled state ( @xmath134 than in the loosely coupled state ( @xmath83 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the same type of theoretical prediction was reported , in our early work @xcite for @xmath135c based on the @xmath136 model , for the @xmath0 particle addition to the compactly coupled state ( @xmath137 ) and to the loosely coupled state ( @xmath138 ) in @xmath139c .    as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : level ] the calculated value of @xmath140be ) is 18.23 mev for the @xmath96 ground state , while for the excited states the @xmath11 values are calculated to be less than 15.5 mev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the observed hida event can be interpreted to be the ground state . when our calculated binding energy is compared with the experimental value of 20.83 mev with a large uncertainty of @xmath141=1.27 mev </S>",
    "<S> , we can say at least that our result does not contradict the data within 2@xmath141 . </S>",
