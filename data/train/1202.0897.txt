    "a number of models with different j/@xmath0 production mechanisms are able to describe the measured j/@xmath0 production cross section reasonably well .",
    "it suggests that other observables are needed to discriminate between different j/@xmath0 production models .",
    "j/@xmath0 spin alignment , commonly named as j/@xmath0 polarization , can be used as such an observable since various models have different @xmath5 dependent predictions on the j/@xmath0 polarization .",
    "the color evaporation model ( cem ) describes j/@xmath0 cross sections measured in many experiments reasonably well but has no prediction power regarding the j/@xmath0 polarization .",
    "the @xmath4 color singlet model ( csm ) @xcite predicts longitudinal j/@xmath0 polarization in the helicity frame at low and mid @xmath5 at mid - rapidity . that recent calculations of the csm for the yield differential in @xmath5 show better agreement with rhic data at low and mid @xmath5 than earlier csm calculations and the result for j/@xmath0 polarization is in good agreement with the phenix data .",
    "non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd ) effective theory , also known as color octet model ( com ) predicts transverse polarization at high j/@xmath0 @xmath5 , @xmath6 5 gev/@xmath3 which is in disagreement with the polarization measurement from the cdf experiment at fermilab @xcite . on the other hand",
    "a tuned nrqcd predicts longitudinal j/@xmath0 polarization at 1.5 @xmath7 5 gev/@xmath3 at mid - rapidity and is able to qualitatively describe the phenix j/@xmath0 polarization measurements as well as the cross section measurements @xcite .",
    "the measurement of j/@xmath0 polarization at @xmath8 5 gev/@xmath3 is expected to have discrimination power against different models of j/@xmath0 production since , e.g. , @xmath4 csm and com predict different polarization in that j/@xmath0 @xmath9 region .      in this study ,",
    "j/@xmath0 polarization is analyzed via the angular distribution of the electron decay from charmonium in the helicity frame @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution is derived from the density matrix elements of the production amplitude using parity conservation rules .",
    "polar angle @xmath10 is the angle between the positron momentum vector in the j/@xmath0 rest frame and j/@xmath0 momentum vector in the laboratory frame .",
    "the angular distribution integrated over the azimuthal angle is parametrized : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the polarization parameter that contains both the longitudinal and transverse components of the j/@xmath0 cross section .",
    "when @xmath12 = 0 there is no polarization , @xmath12 = -1 means full longitudinal polarization and @xmath12 = 1 corresponds to full transverse polarization .",
    "in this analysis , data recorded in 200 gev @xmath1 collisions in the star experiment in year 2009 is used .",
    "the analyzed data was sampled from an integrated luminosity of @xmath131.5 @xmath14 and was triggered by the star barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) .",
    "the trigger required transverse energy deposited in a single bemc tower ( @xmath15 ) to be within 2.6 @xmath16 4.3 gev .",
    "j/@xmath0 is reconstructed via its dielectron decay channel j/@xmath17 with branching ratio br = 5.9% , and is required that at least one of electrons from j/@xmath0 decay satisfies the trigger conditions .",
    "the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , time of flight ( tof ) and bemc detectors are used to reconstruct and identify electrons .",
    "the tpc provides information about de / dx .",
    "information from the tof is very useful for electron identification and hadron rejection at lower momenta , where electron and hadron de / dx bands overlap , @xmath18 0.03 ( @xmath19 = v/@xmath3 ) cut was applied at p @xmath20 1.4 gev/@xmath3 . in 2009",

    "momenta the bemc can reject hadrons very efficiently .",
    "for momenta above 1.4 gev/@xmath3 a cut of e / p @xmath21 0.5 was used , where e is energy deposited in a single bemc tower ( for electrons e / p ratio is expected to be @xmath22 1 ) .",
