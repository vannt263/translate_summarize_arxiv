    "the standard way to estimate molecular gas mass in galaxies uses the luminosity of the @xmath2co j=10 line and converts it to molecular gas mass by using the so - called standard galactic conversion factor @xmath10 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath11 on the ambient conditions of the molecular gas has been extensively explored .",
    "the main factors are : a ) metalicity and the intensity of the ambient uv radiation field ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , b ) the density , temperature , and kinematic state of the average molecular cloud and , c ) effects of particular geometries ( e.g. see @xcite ; @xcite for a recent exposition ) . in the environments of extreme starbursts",
    "it has been clearly demonstrated that the standard method overestimates @xmath12 since it yields masses comparable or larger than the dynamical ones ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in low metallicity environments with high uv intensities",
    "the larger rate of co dissociation with respect to @xmath6 produces a lower co luminosity per @xmath13 and thus underestimates @xmath12 .    in principle",
    "the aforementioned effects can be taken into account by a combination of observational and theoretical work studying a wide range of galactic environments , which can then provide `` adjusted '' @xmath14 factors to be used for the appropriate set of conditions .",
    "however little can be done if the @xmath13 is so diffuse and/or cold that the @xmath2co j=10 line is very faint or not not luminous at all .",
    "hints of such physical conditions have been recently reported for the outer parts of milky way ( usuda et al . 1998 ) and cold dense clouds have been reported for m 31 ( @xcite ) . in such cases",
    "the advantage of easily detecting and mapping a bright co line and thus the distribution of @xmath6 is lost .",
    "here we report deep sub - mm imaging of the prototype sy2/starburst galaxy ngc 1068 that reveals extended emission from dust well beyond the co - bright regions and associated with the hi .",
    "the observations were made on two nights in 1997 august 4 and 1998 january 26 with the sub - mm common user bolometer array ( scuba ) at the 15 m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "scuba is a dual camera system cooled well below 1 k that allows sky - background limited simultaneous observations with two arrays .",
    "the short - wavelength array contains 91 pixels and the long - wavelength array 37 pixels .",
    "both arrays have approximately the same field of view on the sky @xmath15 . for a full description of the instrument see @xcite .",
    "we performed dual wavelength imaging at 450 @xmath1 m and 850 @xmath1 m using the 64-point jiggle mapping mode that allows nyquist sampling of the field of view ( @xcite ) .",
    "we employed the recommended rapid beam switching at a frequency of 8 hz and a beam throw of @xmath16 in azimuth .",
    "the pointing and focus of the telescope were monitored frequently using mars , jupiter and crl 618 , with an expected rms pointing error of @xmath17 .",
    "all the ngc  1068 maps were bracketed by skydips used to correct for atmospheric extinction .",
    "typical opacities at 850 @xmath0 m were @xmath18 for our 1998 run and @xmath19 for our 1997 run .",
    "frequent photometric measurements and beam maps of crl  618 and mars allowed close monitoring of the gains ( jy / beam volt@xmath20 ) .",
    "these can vary significantly especially at 450 @xmath1 m if the dish has not thermally relaxed and can even be elevation dependent ( sandell  1998 ) .",
    "the individual jiggle maps are consistent in terms of peak and integrated intensities and were co - added after flatfielding , correcting for atmospheric extinction , and editing out bad bolometers / integrations using the standard reduction package surf ( @xcite ) .",
    "special care was taken to remove sky - noise using bolometers at the edge of the field of view that `` look '' at sky emission only ( @xcite ) . as a result the final maps have exceptional sensitivity , close to the one expected from the total integration time and the nefds at the sky conditions of our runs .",
    "flux calibration of the final maps in mjy / beam was obtained from beam maps of crl  618 obtained with the same chop throw as our ngc 1068 maps .",
    "the corresponding beam profiles were obtained from beam maps of crl 618 and mars .",
    "the calibration information is summarized in table 1 .",
    "editor : place table 1 here",
    "the clear association of the sub - mm emission from dust and hi gas is demonstrated in figure 1 where the 850 @xmath1 m and 450 @xmath1 m maps are overlayed with an hi map ( brinks et al .",
    "1994 ) at a common resolution of @xmath21 . figure 2 shows the bright central 450 @xmath22 m emission and the associated @xmath2co j=10 integrated brightness ( @xcite ) that lie within the central hi `` hole '' seen in figure 1 .",
    "this wealth of imaging data for the ism in ngc  1068 and the wide range of conditions present due to the existence of the central starburst ( telesco et al .",
    "1984 ) make it an ideal testing `` ground '' of our standard ideas about the distribution and mass of the various ism phases on large scales .",
    "we adopt a distance to ngc  1068 of 14  mpc ( @xmath23 ) where @xmath24 = 68 pc .",
    "a remarkable property of the sub - mm emission is that it extends over the entire bright hi emission where the estimated @xmath25 ratio is lower than in the co - bright region where the starburst occurs .",
    "this ratio and its variations across the image can be a good temperature indicator as long as the average dust temperature is @xmath26 k. indeed , assuming a single average dust component , this ratio can be expressed as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the emissivity law .",
    "it can be easily seen that the ratio tends to the r - j limit for dust temperatures of @xmath29k and is no longer temperature - sensitive .",
    "nevertheless , for a range of @xmath30 k , it varies by a factor of @xmath31 .",
    "this temperature range is particularly interesting since it `` marks '' the transition between cool and warm dust , the latter dominating the iras 100 @xmath1 m and 60 @xmath1 m bands .",
    "after carefully correcting the integrated flux densities for the error beam contribution ( sandell 1998 ) using the correction factors tabulated in table 1 , we obtain @xmath32 . for @xmath33",
    "this agrees well with the range of gas temperatures @xmath34 k found from studying the co excitation within this region ( @xcite ) and the minimum temperature of @xmath35 k implied from the observed @xmath2co j=10 brightness temperatures in high resolution maps ( e.g. @xcite ) . for the sub - mm emission associated with the hi distribution we find @xmath36",
    "this ratio suggests colder gas , in the range of @xmath37 k , but rules out any m 31-type clouds ( loinard & allen 1998 ) where @xmath38 k. here we must emphasize that the main uncertainty in the estimate of r is due to systematic factors ( @xmath39 ) that stay unchanged across the maps .",
    "the thermal rms uncertainty is @xmath40 and thus the observed change of r between the co - bright and the hi - bright regions is much more significant than the total quoted uncertainties imply .",
    "the spatial resolution of our sub - mm maps and the hi , @xmath2co j=10 maps from the literature permits us to estimate the gas / dust ratio as a function of position in this galaxy . combining the standard expressions for the hi , h@xmath41 and dust mass the gas / dust ratio in astrophysical units is expressed as follows :    @xmath42,\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the velocity - integrated flux densities of the hi hyperfine transition and the @xmath2co j=10 line respectively in jy km s@xmath20 , @xmath45 is the standard galactic conversion factor in units of @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the sub - mm flux density at frequency @xmath48 in  jy .",
    "we adopted the emissivity law given by hildebrand ( 1983 ) , namely @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 ghz ( 250 @xmath1 m ) .    for a galactocentric radius of @xmath52 , where most of the fir emission arises ( telesco et al .",
    "1984 ) , we estimate @xmath53 jy km s@xmath54 ( from the @xmath2co j=10 channel maps , helfer & blitz 1995 ) , @xmath55 jy km s@xmath54 and @xmath56 jy , @xmath57  jy . for @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( i.e. the standard galactic value ) , the observed 850 @xmath1 m flux density implies    @xmath60    for @xmath61 k yields @xmath62 , similar to the molecular gas - to - dust ratio found in spirals using iras 100 @xmath1 m and 60 @xmath1 m fluxes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    assuming that the actual gas - to - dust ratio in ngc 1068 is similar to that for the milky way , namely 100 - 150",
    ", we conclude that the application of equation ( 3 ) leads to a significant overestimate of this ratio for the inner region ( @xmath63 ) of ngc 1068 .",
    "there is indeed independent evidence ( e.g. downes & solomon 1998 ) which suggests that the standard galactic conversion factor applied to starburst nuclei leads to significant overestimates the @xmath6 content in these regions .",
    "in addition , papadopoulos & seaquist ( 1998 ) provide indications that @xmath12 in the inner region of ngc 1068 is overestimated by a factor of two , which would then produce agreement between the ratio for the nuclear region ngc 1068 and the milky way .    for @xmath64 ,",
    "no bright co emission is detected ( see fig .",
    "2 , helfer & blitz  1995 ) .",
    "there is , however , evidence for faint co emission . by integrating over the area @xmath65",
    "we find @xmath66 jy km s@xmath20 . over the same area",
    ", we estimate @xmath67  jy  km  s@xmath54 and @xmath68 jy , @xmath69 jy . using these figures , together with equation ( 2 ) and the standard value for @xmath45 , we obtain ,    @xmath70    for @xmath71 k we obtain @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the good agreement of the gas - to - dust ratio with that of the milky way suggests that most of the gas / dust mass is accounted for .",
    "however , the co becomes exceedingly faint and essentially undetectable at @xmath74 .",
    "if we assume the lowest gas / dust temperature of @xmath75 k allowed by the @xmath76 ratio , the inferred gas - to - dust ratio for @xmath77 would be @xmath78 with @xmath79 ( using the standard @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus , the use of the standard conversion factor in this region may underestimate @xmath12 by a factor of @xmath80 .",
    "it seems possible that this molecular gas phase is not co - bright mainly because of low densities ( @xmath81  @xmath82 ) rather than low gas / dust temperatures .",
    "a thermalized @xmath83co j=10 line would remain luminous as long as @xmath84 k , and lower temperatures would yield @xmath85 which is not observed . assuming similar spatial and velocity filling factors , we estimate that the average @xmath2co j=10 brightness temperature for the outer regions @xmath86 . for the various molecular clouds ( size @xmath87 pc ) within the @xmath88 radius @xmath89  k ( e.g. planesas , scoville & myers  1991 ) , hence for similar size molecular clouds in the hi - bright regions it would be @xmath90 k. this is significantly lower than the gas / dust temperature inferred by the @xmath76 ratio over the same regions , thus implying sub - thermally excited @xmath2co j=10 .",
    "these characteristics of the diffuse @xmath6 phase makes sub - mm measurements very valuable since , while co is very faint and may underestimate the @xmath13 mass , the dust / gas temperature is still high enough to allow sub - mm imaging to reveal the distribution and mass of the @xmath13 mixed with hi , under the assumption of a canonical gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "we expect this gas phase to be a general feature in spiral galaxies and sensitive sub - mm imaging of the regions with high hi column densities is a new tool to study its properties through the associated dust emission .",
    "the results of deep sub - mm imaging of the archetypal seyfert 2/starburst galaxy ngc  1068 can be summarized as follows :    \\1 . extended sub - mm emission due to dust with a temperature of @xmath91  k is found associated with the regions with the highest hi column densities .",
    "a more spatially concentrated and warmer ( @xmath92 k ) component is found in the inner starburst region where most of the gas is molecular .",
    "the estimated gas - to - dust ratio for the inner region is @xmath93 while for the dust emission associated with the hi gas we find @xmath94 depending on the value of the gas / dust temperature .",
    "\\2 . under the assumption that a milky way value of @xmath95 applies also to ngc 1068",
    ", we conclude that the high value of @xmath96 in its starburst region is a result of an overestimate of the molecular gas mass .",
    "this seems to be a systematic effect of using the standard galactic conversion factor to convert @xmath2co j=10 luminosity to molecular gas mass in starburst environments .",
    "the diffuse @xmath97 gas that is mixed with the hi gas is associated with sub - thermally excited and very faint co emission .",
    "furthermore it is more massive than hi , with @xmath98 and the standard galactic conversion factor may underestimate @xmath12 at low gas / dust temperatures of @xmath99 k. for this gas phase sensitive sub - mm imaging provides a better tool than co imaging in revealing its distribution and mass .",
    "we thank rob ivison and lorne avery for conducting a wonderful set of observations with scuba , and wayne holland for friendly and useful advice .",
