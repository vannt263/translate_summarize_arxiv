    "interactions between a quantum system and its environment lead to changes of the system state and can result in the loss of coherence .",
    "this effect , often called decoherence , is a limiting factor for many applications , such as quantum computing .",
    "the loss of information associated with this process can be measured by the decreasing overlap between the initial and current states .",
    "this overlap ( state fidelity ) changes quadratically for times short enough compared to the inverse of the strength of the system - environment coupling and the correlation time of the environment , provided this coupling is also static on the relevant timescale @xcite . if such a system is repeatedly projected back to the original state by measurements performed before the state has changed significantly , the effect of the system - environment interaction can be effectively eliminated in the limit of sufficiently frequent measurements .",
    "this is termed the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) @xcite .",
    "there are many potential applications of qze , like entanglement generation @xcite , quantum metrology @xcite , and quantum imaging @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that qze is different from dynamical decoupling , which also suppresses decoherence .",
    "although both schemes were unified from the viewpoint of a strong interaction between a system of interest and the others @xcite , there is a clear difference between them . while dynamical decoupling uses unitary control to average out the system - environment interaction @xcite , the non - unitary dynamics introduced by the measurements is essential for the state stabilization in qze .    in the simplest case ,",
    "the evolution suppressed by qze is driven by a single interaction to a static external degree of freedom .",
    "typical examples include a transition between two states of a single trapped ion @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , and atomic systems @xcite .",
    "another example is the confinement of a unitary dynamics in a specific subspace , as demonstrated in a rubidium bose einstein condensate @xcite . in a more sophisticated case",
    ", qze restrains the non - unitary dynamics of an open quantum system @xcite , instead of suppressing a unitary evolution driven by external fields .",
    "one experiment controlled such non - unitary dynamics , the escape rate of atoms from a trap , using the qze @xcite .",
    "however , qze to suppress the dephasing of a two - level system was not demonstrated yet .    in this paper , we present a proof - of - principle demonstration that qze is equally possible to stabilize the state of a quantum system subject to dephasing by successive measurements .",
    "we employ a liquid - state nmr quantum computer with a two - spin molecule . however , the ensemble nature of nmr is not essential to implement the measurements in our experiments , unlike in @xcite .",
    "a similar scheme was proposed for a non - ensemble system in @xcite .",
    "also , qze experiments without relying on an ensemble average were reported @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , a brief review on qze and a detailed theoretical background of our experiment are presented .",
    "we show a proof - of - principle demonstration , including a characterization of the molecule employed in our experiments , in sec .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusion and discussions , where we propose a scheme to protect an arbitrary state by using qze .",
    "in order to understand the essence of qze , it is sufficient to consider a coherent superposition of a qubit being dephased by a randomly fluctuating classical field @xcite , with the concept of `` mixing process '' @xcite .",
    "the relevant hamiltonian is thus @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the energy of the system , @xmath2 denotes the strength of the fluctuating field , @xmath3 denotes the environmental operator to represent the interaction with the system , @xmath4 denotes the environmental energy , @xmath5 denotes the environmental operator , and @xmath6 is a pauli matrix .",
    "the hamiltonian contains only @xmath7 because only pure dephasing is considered .",
    "we go to an interaction picture , obtaining @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "we prepare a superposition state @xmath10 for the system .",
    "the density matrix of the system and the environment is @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denotes the initial state of the environment . formally integrating the von neumann equation",

    "( [ eq : td_rhos ] ) , we have the state fidelity @xmath30 is then @xmath31 which corresponds to a linear decay .",
    "it is a well known fact qze is not observable in this regime @xcite .    in the opposite limit of a slowly fluctuating environment , where @xmath32 , the correlation function is constant , @xmath33 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : td_rhos ] ) becomes for @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 , i.e. , the decoherence quadratically starts : @xmath37 this is the regime the qze can be observed : if @xmath38 sequential projective measurements of @xmath39 are carried out on the system and the delay between the measurements is short compared to the correlation time , @xmath40 , the system remains in the initial state with a probability @xmath41 .",
    "since the exponent can become arbitrarily small for large @xmath38 , the decoherence vanishes asymptotically .",
    "we intend to show a proof - of - principle demonstration with nmr that qze is employed for protecting a phase decoherence .",
    "we need to answer two questions : 1 ) how to obtain a system that shows a quadratic decay .",
    "2 ) how to measure a quantum system without employing ensemble averages , unlike usual nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "a molecule in a solvent strongly and rapidly interacts with molecules of the solvent .",
    "these interactions are so strong and rapid that they effectively cancel with each other .",
    "therefore , the effective interaction between the molecule and the solvent is often small @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is called motional narrowing .",
    "since @xmath42 and @xmath43 of a spin in the molecule become longer , peaks in its nmr spectrum become sharper .",
    "the total number of quantum gates that can be performed within the coherence time is estimated as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes the time of the gate operation .",
    "these long @xmath43 guarantees many quantum operations and liquid state nmr is often employed to demonstrate quantum algorithms .",
    "we introduce molecules with magnetic dipole moments , originated from electrons , into the solvent .",
    "these molecules generate strong but short range magnetic fields .",
    "they are short range in the sense that they decay with @xmath46 or faster as a function of @xmath47 , the distance .",
    "these molecules are called magnetic impurities .",
    "they also move rapidly in the solvent .",
    "when a magnetic impurity passes by a molecule , a strong interaction between a spin in the molecule and the magnetic impurity changes the spin state abruptly .",
    "such an interaction leads to a final spin state uncorrelated to the initial one .",
    "motional narrowing does not occur , since there are not enough magnetic impurities for their effects to be canceled on average .",
    "the interaction of the spin with the magnetic impurity is a @xmath27 function - like in time , and thus we do not expect a quadratic decay of the spin state .",
    "the higher density of the magnetic impurity leads to shorter @xmath42 and @xmath43 , but the characteristic of the state decay is always linear , like in eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear_decay ] ) .",
    "now , let us consider a two - spin molecule .",
    "one of the two spins ( called e ) is under the influence of a magnetic impurity and interacts with the other spin ( called s ) through a scalar coupling ( for simplicity , the weak coupling limit @xcite is assumed ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 @xmath50 is a pauli operator acting on the spin e ( s ) .",
    "@xmath51 is the strength of the scalar coupling , in frequency units .",
    "the spin s interacts only with the spin e and free from the magnetic impurity .",
    "the delta function - like interaction on the spin e due to the magnetic impurity is transformed into a slower interaction on the spin s by the scalar coupling . in this case ,",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath42 of the spin e determine the correlation time .",
    "however , for the case considered in this paper , the @xmath51 term is more essential in the practical range of @xmath42 of the spin e and the correlation time becomes of the order of @xmath52 .",
    "we can obtain a spin showing a quadratic decay with a two - spin molecule and magnetic impurities .",
    "the correlation time is of the order of @xmath52 , usually of few milliseconds for a carbon and hydrogen nuclei combination and thus this interaction is well controllable with nmr techniques",
    ". a similar approach has been reported , but using a series of pulses instead of magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "a field gradient was often employed as a projective measurement in nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "however , it is based on a spacial averaging , or the ensemble nature of nmr , and thus it is considered as a mere simulation of a projective measurement .",
    "therefore , we can not employ a field gradient as a projective measurement in our experiment .",
    "we have to implement a measurement according to its definition .",
    "a measurement of a system means the system is entangled to a measurement apparatus .",
    "then , the measurement apparatus falls into one of its eigenstates .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue is treated as the measured value @xcite . according to this idea , we are able to implement a non - selective measurement @xmath53 with another qubit , called a device ( d ) , as follows @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 is a cnot gate whose control and target qubits are the device d and the system s , respectively .",
    "we employ @xmath58 as an entangler , while @xmath59 causes the phase decoherence of the device d @xcite .",
    "this measurement operation is virtual and instantaneous .",
    "this procedure is effective when the system and device are not correlated before the measurements are performed .",
    "such condition is satisfied , since the device is perfectly decohered by the operator @xmath60 at the end of each measurement .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we use a stochastic master equation to describe the measurement , and such a master equation usually requires an average of the measurement outcomes @xcite .",
    "however , the average technique is not against the fact that our scheme does not rely on the nature of ensemble average . even for a single spin , one needs to repeat the experiment many times , and needs to take an average of the measurement results .",
    "for example , in @xcite , they consider a single nv center , and a model similar to ours is applied to include the fluctuating noise , using an average .",
    "similarly , our calculation described here can be applied to a single spin .",
    "we combine the ideas in ",
    "[ sss_quadratic_decay ] and   [ sss_projective_meas ] to design an ideal qze simulation .",
    "we consider a three - qubit system .",
    "the first qubit is a system s of which phase is protected .",
    "the second qubit e mediates and filters the random noise caused by a magnetic impurity to the system .",
    "the third qubit is a device d.    first , we consider a time development without @xmath53 as follows .",

    "we describe the open system dynamics with the operator sum formalism @xcite .",
    "the density matrix change during @xmath62 is @xmath63 where @xmath64 determines the strength of decoherence , @xmath49 is a @xmath6 operator acting on the spin e , and @xmath65 is a random variable indicating the rotation axis of the @xmath66-rotation on the spin e , caused by the magnetic impurity .",
    "@xmath64 is a function of the concentrations of the magnetic impurity and the molecule of interest .",
    "since the initial state of e is @xmath67 and @xmath68 contains only @xmath69 , @xmath70 is equivalent to @xmath71 for the interaction @xmath68 , where @xmath72 is an arbitrary integer .",

    "a more oscillatory behaviour is observed for large @xmath62 values , as seen in figure  [ fig : qze_xx10 ] .",
    "these oscillations are originated from the @xmath51-coupling and the large oscillations indicate that the qze is less effective . therefore , @xmath158  ms is the optimal measurement frequency for the qze demonstration with our imperfect measurement of @xmath169 @xcite .",

    "this process transforms the state @xmath173 to @xmath174 , which means the relaxation is more effective in this case .",
    "we are able to avoid most of the unwanted effects of longitudinal relaxation on the @xmath89c spin dynamics during @xmath131 taking @xmath166 as a measurement .",
    "the longer @xmath131 leads to fewer oscillations of the signal , as seen in figure  [ fig : qze_sim ] .",

    "it is worth mentioning that , the only difference between the figures  [ fig : fid_c ] and  [ fig : qze_sim ] are the existence of the entangling operations ( measurements by the device ) , and the suppression of the decoherence in the figure  [ fig : qze_sim ] comes from the implementation of the measurements .",
