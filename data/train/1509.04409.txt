    "the light source of our experiment is a continuous - wave ( cw ) ti : sapphire laser operating at the wavelength of 860 nm .",
    "in addition to the setup shown in fig .",
    "1a , there are two optical cavities which are omitted from fig .  1a .",
    "one cavity is a second - harmonic generator , which is a bow - tie - shaped cavity and contains a periodically - poled ktiopo@xmath1 ( ppktp ) crystal as a nonlinear optical medium . the resulting continuous output beam at the wavelength of 430 nm is , after a frequency shift by an acousto - optic modulator , directed as a pump beam to each memory cavity , which contains a periodically - poled ktiopo@xmath1 ( ppktp ) crystal as a nonlinear optical medium and works as a non - degenerate optical parametric oscillator ( nopo ) .",
    "the pumping power at each memory cavity is about 3 mw .",
    "optionally , the pump beams can be individually blocked after a herald in order to prevent further production of photons , but this was not employed in this demonstration , because the probability of such unwanted events is small .",
    "the other cavity is a mode - cleaning cavity , by which the transverse mode of the local oscillators is purified to a tem@xmath2 mode in order to maximize the interference visibility at the homodyne detections .",
    "the power of each local oscillator is about 18 mw .    the concatenated - cavity - based memory systems ( memory-1 , memory-2 ) have the same design , similar to our previous experiment @xcite but with parameters slightly different from before .",
    "the design of the concatenated - cavity - based memory system is as follows .",
    "the transmissivity of the coupling mirror that couples the memory cavity and the shutter cavity is 1.6 % and the transmissivity of the outcoupling mirror at the exit of the shutter cavity is 24.7% .",
    "the former transmissivity corresponds to a compromise between long lifetime and phase - locking stability , while the latter is set in accordance with the former in order to operate the system nearly at the critical damping condition @xcite .",
    "the memory cavity has a free spectrum range ( fsr ) of 214.1 mhz .",
    "spontaneous parametric down conversion inside the memory cavity produces signal and idler photons which are separated by this fsr .",
    "the shutter cavity contains an electro - optic modulator ( eom ) , which is a rbtiopo@xmath1 ( rtp ) crystal with an aperture size of 4 mm @xmath3 4 mm .",
    "it is driven by a high - voltage switch ( bergmann messgerte entwicklung kg ) , whose voltage is around 900 v to match the frequency shift to the fsr of the memory cavity .    in order to stabilize the whole setup ,",
    "all of the resonant frequencies of the cavities and the phases of the local oscillators are each electronically controlled by using a feedback loop .",
    "each controller is composed of an analog feedback controller , an error detector of locking , and a digital scanner for the error recovery .",
    "the error detection signals from all of the controllers are brought together by logical or gates , and then sent to the timing controller in order to pause the measurement when there is an error .",
    "the timing controller is a field - programmable gate array ( fpga ) ( virtex-4 , xilinx ) , which processes the heralding signals and controls the timing of the photon release .",
    "the same timing controller actually also controls the sequence of the switching between the feedback phase and the measurement phase , as explained below . for the analog feedback control ,",
    "we monitor the optical systems by means of bright beams .",
    "however , such bright beams , except for the local oscillator beams and the pump beams , represent an extra complication in our single - photon - level experiment .",
    "therefore we cyclically switch the optical systems .",
    "one phase is the feedback phase where the bright beams are injected to the cavity systems .",
    "the other is the measurement phase where the bright beams are blocked and the two - photon interference is tested .",
    "the switching rate is 5 khz , and the duty cycle is 40% for the measurement phase .",
    "as mentioned above , the fpga controls the release timing of photons .",
    "the fpga clock frequency is 100 mhz , and thus , in our system , the release timings are synchronized with 10 ns intervals .",
    "note that the timing jitter of the driving signals in the timing controller was negligibly small ( less than 1 ns ) , compared to the width of the wavepackets of photons ( about 100 ns ) .",
    "the photon arrival times of the two inputs are matched by adjusting the electric cable lengths from the timing controller to the eoms , as well as the optical path lengths from the exits of the shutter cavities to the balanced beam splitter of the hom interferometer .",
    "the lengths of the two output arms to the data - storage oscilloscope are also matched .",
    "these were tested in the preliminary experiment .    in the hom experiment ,",
    "the photons are released when both heralding events of memory-1 and memory-2 happen within 2 @xmath4 .",
    "if the second herald does not occur by 2 @xmath4 , the timing controller becomes idle and waits for 5 @xmath0s , which is long enough compared to the memory lifetime of about 2 @xmath0s . during this dead time ,",
    "the heralded photon is almost lost and the memory systems are almost initialized again .",
    "in the preliminary experiment , we tested our memory systems by using a highly reflective mirror as the replaceable mirror ( rm ) . for each memory-@xmath5 , we repeated single - photon generation and homodyne detection 43,404 times for each variable set storage time @xmath6 after the herald , changed from 0 ns to 500 ns at 50-ns intervals . from the results , we estimated the shapes of the wavepackets @xmath7 by utilizing principal component analysis @xcite , as shown in fig .  1b , and calculated the single - photon purities @xmath8 ( corresponding to the respective single - photon fractions ) , as shown in fig .",
    "the single - photon purities are shown to degrade for longer storage times indicating a finite memory lifetime , but the wigner - function - negativity condition @xcite with purities above 0.5 is still satisfied for up to about 0.4  @xmath0s . as shown in fig .",
    "1c , the maximum storage time @xmath9 of the synchronization can be set much longer than this 0.4  @xmath0s , thus preserving the negativity .",
    "the shapes of the estimated wavepackets @xmath7 , shown in fig .  1b , are independent of @xmath6 , excluding pre - leakage .",
    "furthermore , they are almost the same between memory-1 and memory-2 .",
    "the overlap @xmath10 was 0.992 .",
    "we defined the signal wavepacket for the hom experiment as an average temporal mode : @xmath11/ \\sqrt{\\int dt | f_1(t ; 0 ) + f_2(t ; 0)|^2}$ ] .",
    "the overlap between the signal wavepacket and the estimated wavepacket released from the individual memory-@xmath5 after @xmath6 , defined as @xmath12 , was larger than 0.96 for up to @xmath6 = 500 ns , as listed in supplementary table  [ table : modefunction ] .",
    "this high value contributes to the visibility of the hom interference and the purities of the input states .",
    "the estimated purities @xmath8 corresponding to the estimated wavepackets @xmath7 in fig .",
    "1bare listed in table  [ table : modefunction ] , corresponding to the exact values of the points in fig .  s1a .",
    "in order to exclude the influence of the mode mismatches on the input purities , we also calculated purities @xmath13 by using the time - shifted signal wavepacket @xmath14 , as also shown in table  [ table : modefunction ] . from the values below",
    ", we can see that the contribution of the pre - leakage is very small .",
    "the decay of the purity is thus due to the optical losses in each memory system .",
    "these results are fitted with an exponential decay curve @xmath15 , where @xmath16 means the initial purity and @xmath17 means the memory lifetime for the memory system .          in the hom experiment , we synchronized the photon sources , created an initial dual - single - photon state , and then obtained an output hom state by replacing the highly - reflective rm in fig .",
    "1a with a balanced beam splitter .",
    "the storage time of each event was recorded together with the homodyne outcomes .",
    "then , in order to observe the dependence on @xmath9 , we analyzed those events associated with a storage time between 0 and @xmath9",
    ". figure  s1b shows the obtained number of events with respect to each @xmath9 .",
    "it indicates a linear increase of the dual - heralding event rate for any extension of @xmath9 .",
    "here we discuss how the maximum storage time @xmath9 is dependent on the dual - heralding event rate .",
    "we assume that the individual heralding events of the memories occur at random and independently , i.e.  they follow the poisson distributions with average event rates @xmath18 for each memory-@xmath5 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "considering the ( dimensionless ) measurement duty @xmath20 and ignoring the 5-@xmath0s dead time for simplicity , the theoretical dual - heralding event rate is given by @xmath21 , when @xmath9 is much smaller than @xmath22 and @xmath23 . here",
    "the factor of 2 effectively stems from the fact that the first heralding event may occur in either of memory-1 and memory-2 .",
    "this linear relationship of the dual - heralding event rate for @xmath9 can be confirmed in fig .",
    "the experimental parameters were @xmath24 counts per second ( cps ) , and @xmath25 .",
    "from above , the predicted dual - heralding event rate for @xmath26 1.8  @xmath4 is @xmath27  cps , which agrees well with the experimental value of about 90  cps .",
    "in order to estimate the enhancement by the memories in the dual - heralding event rate , here we discuss the coherence time of the wavepacket without synchronization , from the aspect of the 0.5-bound of the wigner - function - negativity condition .",
    "however , we note that this is a problem dependent on how the signal wavepacket is defined .",
    "a reasonable definition of the signal wavepacket is to set the temporal origin of the signal wavepaket to the mean of the two heralding event timings : when individual heralding events happen at @xmath28 and @xmath29 , then a signal wavepacket @xmath30 has a balanced overlap with both of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . by using this definition , we calculate the average purity for various timing - mismatched events @xmath33 as a function of the maximum time difference @xmath34 .",
    "then we find that the average purity crosses the 0.5-bound of the wigner - function - negativity condition at @xmath34 = 72  ns .",
    "comparing this @xmath34 of 72  ns with the @xmath9 of 1.8  @xmath4 for the synchronized case , and taking into account the linear dependence on @xmath9 , the memory enhancement in the event rate can be estimated at a factor of 25 .",
    "let us now discuss the image of the hom state in the wave basis by considering wavefunctions ( probability amplitudes ) in fig .",
    "s2 . theoretically , vacuum _ math _ , single - photon _ math _ , and two - photon _ math _ states have zero , one , and two nodes in their schrdinger standing wave functions _ math _ for the field quadrature amplitude _ math _ , respectively ( fig .",

    "<S> numerous tests of the hom effect have been performed over the past few decades mainly in order to characterize single - photon sources , such as parametric down converters @xcite , trapped single neutral atoms @xcite , ions @xcite , atomic ensembles @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , and nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the simultaneous occurrence of two single photons at a beam splitter has depended on a random coincidence between two independent statistical sources . </S>",
    "<S> one possible way toward scalability is to combine statistical photon sources with quantum memories , by which a photon is stored until the other photon is available too @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , such quantum storage must not be at the expense of the single - photon purity . only in a very recent experiment , </S>",
    "<S> optical single - photon states sufficiently pure to show a negative dip in their wigner functions @xcite were released in a controlled fashion ( quasi on demand ) from a memory system based on optical cavities @xcite or atomic ensembles @xcite .    here </S>",

    "<S> the resulting states still have single - photon purities above 0.5 , which is sufficient for a negative wigner function . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the memories , utilizing controlled storage times of up to 1.8 @xmath0s , the output hom state can be synchronized . </S>",

    "<S> another important aspect of our approach , making it distinct from all postselective schemes based on particle - like click - by - click photon detections , is the characterization of the resulting hom state from a wave - like perspective using homodyne measurements of field quadrature amplitudes . here </S>",
    "<S> we will show that a characteristic pattern in the wave basis survives even after the active synchronization with quantum memories . </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics is the wave - particle duality , and our demonstration looks at the famous hom effect from a completely wave - like angle . </S>",
    "<S> this is not only of fundamental interest but also practically important for optical hybrid quantum information processing , where both continuous wave and discrete particle properties are exploited for quantum state preparation , processing , and detection @xcite . since the first demonstration @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the hom effect has been always demonstrated as a dip in the coincidence probability of photon detections at both output ports of the beam splitter . </S>",
    "<S> however , the hom dip only reflects a particle - like aspect of the hom state , in which photonic particle bunching becomes manifest . </S>",
    "<S> the more general , actual quantum nature of that prominent optical quantum state , such as quantum entanglement , can not be revealed by correlation measurements in a fixed particle basis . </S>",
    "<S> the wave - basis image of the hom state that we present here as a counterpart to the particle - basis hom dip is a correlation pattern similar to a four - leaf clover that vanishes and reappears depending on the relative phase _ math _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phase - dependent pattern is actually sufficient for fully characterizing the hom state and obtaining its density matrix @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the pattern is very fragile against optical losses and detection noises mostly because the homodyne detection is sensitive to vacuum fluctuations , unlike the hom dip whose shape is in principle unchanged even for large optical losses . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to observe the phase - sensitive clover pattern , highly pure single photons must be prepared simultaneously and detected with very low - noise homodyne detectors , which became possible only very recently @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our experimental setup is schematically shown in fig .  1a , where every one of the two single - photon sources is enclosed by a memory system ( memory-1 or memory-2 ) which is composed of two concatenated cavities @xcite . </S>",
