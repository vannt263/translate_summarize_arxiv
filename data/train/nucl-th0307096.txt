    "double - strange @xmath7 hypernuclei are nowadays the best systems to investigate the properties of the @xmath5 baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "emulsion experiments and subsequent analysis @xcite have reported the formation of a few @xmath0 hypernuclei , @xmath8he , @xmath9be and @xmath10b . from the resulting @xmath11",
    "binding energies , a quite large @xmath11 bond energy of around 4 - 5 mev emerged , contrary to expectations from su(3 ) @xcite .",
    "a series of theoretical works , based either on phenomenological @xmath5 baryon - baryon interactions or realistic ones , have studied the properties of double-@xmath7 hypernuclei for more than 30 years @xcite .",
    "the recent finding at kek of a new @xmath12he candidate having a @xmath0 bond energy of around 1 mev @xcite has injected a renewed interest on this field . unless new experiments for the other @xmath0 hypernuclei also give lower binding energies in the future , it is now an open question to reconcile theoretically the weak attraction found in @xmath12he with the stronger attraction in the other two heavier systems . although some progress has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where both short- and long - range correlations were simultaneously treated , further investigations are needed to completely settle this question .",
    "filikhin and gal @xcite report faddeev - yakubovsky calculations , complementary to those carried out in the earlier work of ref .",
    "@xcite but using the new nijmegen interactions , not finding a simultaneous description of the @xmath9be and the new @xmath8he binding energies .",
    "however , the nucleon pauli blocking effect affecting , through the coupling to @xmath3 states , the @xmath0 interaction when the particles are embedded in the nuclear medium has not been considered in most of the earlier nor in these recent works @xcite . as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , pauli blocking reduces substantially the additional attraction to the @xmath0 binding energy induced by the @xmath13 conversion .",
    "recently , an attempt to incorporate the pauli suppression effect has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a second order pauli correcting term is introduced in the intermediate states following the @xmath14 transition .",
    "the interaction used in that work is a two - channel @xmath15 gaussian model , which implicitly includes the @xmath4 coupling not only in the effective @xmath0 interaction but also in the @xmath14 transition .",
    "in fact , the important role of the coupling to @xmath4 states has been recently pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and explicitly worked out for the nijmegen interactions in the variational calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to present a careful analysis of the role of coupled channels on the @xmath5 baryon - baryon interaction in the medium , treating pauli blocking effects to all orders in all possible transition channels . for practical purposes ,",
    "most of the recent works @xcite have used simple parameterizations of the new nijmegen potentials in terms of the sum of a few gaussians .",
    "in contrast , we start from the original nijmegen model nsc97e@xcite , as done also in ref .  @xcite . in our approach",
    ", we solve the coupled - channel equation for the g - matrix in infinite nuclear matter , and derive from it the @xmath0 bond energy in finite nuclei .",
    "with respect to existing calculations our treatment of the finite system is very simple .",
    "this has the practical advantage of permitting us to explore in depth the different effects determining the @xmath0 bond energy , such as coupled channels or pauli blocking to all orders .",
    "the @xmath0 bond energy @xmath16 in @xmath0 hypernuclei is determined experimentally from the measurement of the binding energies of double- and single-@xmath7 hypernuclei as @xmath17 a reasonable estimation of this quantity when rearrangement effects are small can be obtained from the value of the @xmath0 @xmath18matrix element in a finite hypernucleus @xmath19 where the two @xmath7 particles are assumed to be in the lowest single particle state of an appropriate @xmath7-nucleus mean field potential .",
    "we will compute the above matrix element from the infinite nuclear matter one in the following way .",
    "first , we construct the @xmath0 @xmath18matrix in infinite matter by solving the well known bethe  goldstone equation which , in partial wave decomposition and using the quantum numbers of the relative and center  of  mass motion , reads @xmath20 where the labels @xmath21 run over @xmath22 and @xmath4 intermediate states . the starting energy @xmath23 is taken equal to @xmath24 , where the experimental value of @xmath25 is taken for each hypernucleus , namely 7.25 mev for @xmath12he @xcite , 17.7 mev for @xmath26be @xcite and 27.5 for @xmath27b @xcite . in this way",
    ", we are considering the interaction of each @xmath7 particle not only with the nucleons in the nucleus but also with the other @xmath7 particle . the nuclear matter density to be used in the pauli operator @xmath28",
    "is determined , for each hypernucleus , as the average nuclear density felt by the @xmath7 particle in that hypernucleus .",
    "this is obtained by weighing the nuclear density at each point with the probability of finding the @xmath7 particle : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the nuclear density profile which is conveniently parameterized as @xmath31 being @xmath32 with @xmath33 fm , @xmath34 fm and @xmath35 the number of nucleons in the hypernucleus .",
    "the @xmath7 wave function is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation using a woods - saxon @xmath7-nucleus potential with parameters @xmath36 adjusted to reproduce the experimental binding energy of the @xmath7 in the single-@xmath7 hypernucleus . for practical computational purposes , from the resulting @xmath7 r.m.s .",
    "radius we derive the oscillator parameter , @xmath37 , of an equivalent harmonic oscillator wave function which will then be used in obtaining the finite hypernucleus two - body g - matrix elements of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta3 ] ) from the nuclear matter ones displayed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gmat ] ) .    in the next step , we express the two - body ket state @xmath38 , built from the @xmath39 states of the equivalent harmonic oscillator potential , in terms of momentum and angular variables @xmath40 in the laboratory frame using @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the corresponding harmonic oscillator function .    finally , we express the two - body state with laboratory coordinates in terms of the states with variables in the relative and center - of - mass system , @xmath43 , used in the solution of the bethe ",
    "goldstone equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the appropriate transformation coefficients @xcite from the relative and center - of - mass frame to the laboratory system .",
    "we note that the only contribution comes from the partial wave @xmath46 . transforming the bra state @xmath47 in a similar way",
    ", one can finally evaluate the @xmath0 bond energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta3 ] ) in terms of the infinite nuclear matter @xmath0 @xmath18matrix elements .    in table",
    "[ tab : tab1 ] we summarize all the parameters that allow us to determine the relevant @xmath7 and nuclear properties needed in the evaluation of the @xmath0 bond energy for the three hypernuclei studied in this work , @xmath48he , @xmath9be and @xmath49b .",
    "the diagonal @xmath46 @xmath0 g - matrix element for zero center - of - mass momentum and zero relative momentum is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : gmat ] as a function of the nuclear matter density for several starting energy values . as density increases ,",
    "the g - matrix element loses attraction as a result of pauli blocking which reduces the available phase space for the intermediate @xmath3 states . on the other hand ,",
    "the g - matrix element gains attraction when the starting energy increases , since the coupling to intermediate states is then more efficient .",
    "we will return to this behavior when the results of finite hypernuclei are discussed .",
    "table [ tab : tab2 ] displays our results for @xmath50 in @xmath12he , for various coupled - channel cases . the value of @xmath16 obtained from a calculation that neglects pauli blocking effects , _",
    "i.e. , _ directly from the t - matrix , is also displayed with brackets . as expected , incorporating the coupling between the @xmath0 and @xmath51 , produces a drastic effect over the @xmath0 uncoupled situation , increasing @xmath16 from 0.16 mev to 0.78 mev , a value that lies very close to the new experimental datum @xcite .",
    "we note that , contrary to what it seems to be implied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the coupling between the @xmath0 and @xmath3 channels is important even when the interaction is weak , as it is the case of the nsc97e potential used here which produces a scattering length of about -0.5 fm . actually , in refs .",
    "@xcite the potential is adjusted for each coupled - channel case to reproduce a common value of the scattering length . therefore ,",
    "part of the coupling effect is embedded in the readjusted parameters .",
    "we now turn to analyzing the effect of the @xmath4 channel , located more than 150 mev higher in energy from the @xmath0 and @xmath3 channels , and which has usually been neglected or taken in an effective way within single - channel ( @xmath0 ) or two - channel ( @xmath52 ) interaction models .",
    "the results shown in table [ tab : tab2 ] reveal , surprisingly , that the role of the @xmath4 channel is very important and reduces substantially the two - channel ( @xmath52 ) value of @xmath16 down to 0.28 mev , which is closer to the uncoupled single - channel result .",
    "note that the repulsion found for the full coupled - channel g - matrix element around the @xmath0 threshold does not necessarily mean that the @xmath4 channel produces a more repulsive interaction .",
    "in fact , the @xmath53 nijmegen model becomes so attractive that it even supports a spurious deeply bound yy state around 1500 mev below the @xmath0 threshold @xcite .",
    "however , the size of the g - matrix will not be affected by the presence of this bound state since it lies very far away from the region of energies required by our model .",
    "the net effect around the @xmath0 threshold is that the full coupled - channel calculation has a smaller bond energy than the case in which only the @xmath0 and the @xmath3 channels are retained . comparing the results of @xmath16 with those between brackets , which have been obtained from a t - matrix calculation",
    ", one observes that pauli blocking effects ( non - existing in the single channel @xmath0 case ) are quite important , especially when the three - channels ( @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) are considered , reducing by half the value of @xmath16 .",
    "we note that our pauli unblocked value of 0.54 mev , obtained for the complete coupled channel calculation using the original nijmegen potential nsc97e , is reasonably close to results obtained directly in finite hypernuclei but using effective gaussian parameterizations fitted to the scattering length of the nijmegen nsc97e interaction , namely @xmath54 mev @xcite and @xmath55 mev @xcite .",
    "we note that the recent variational calculation using the nijmegen interactions quotes a slightly larger value of 0.81 mev @xcite .",
    "the results of table  [ tab : tab2 ] show that a proper treatment of pauli blocking , neglected in most of the calculations using more sophisticated ways of treating the finite hypernucleus @xcite , is needed to draw conclusions on the particular value of @xmath16 predicted by a given interaction .",
    "a first attempt to incorporate the pauli suppression effect within the context of finite hypernuclei has been done recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a pauli blocking term , correcting the phase space of intermediate @xmath3 states accessed via @xmath14 conversion up to second order in the effective interaction , is added . the @xmath0 bond energy",
    "is then reduced from 0.64 mev to 0.21 mev , hence finding a pauli suppression of 0.43 mev , which is about twice the size of the reduction we find in the present work , namely @xmath56 mev @xmath57 mev .",
    "the reason for the difference has to be found in higher order terms of the pauli correction .",
    "indeed , if , in the spirit of the procedure followed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we truncate the series that defines the @xmath58-matrix in terms of the @xmath2-matrix , @xmath59 , up to second order in @xmath2 , then the contribution of the pauli blocking correcting term , @xmath60 , amounts to 0.36 mev .",
    "this is consistent with the value of 0.43 mev quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite which was obtained with a slightly modified effective interaction to fit the new @xmath16 value in @xmath12he .",
    "moreover , we have checked that the series converges to our t - matrix result and , hence , to our complete pauli correction of 0.26 mev . the pauli correction built directly in the finite nucleus in the full coupled - channel calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite is also small and of the order of 0.2 mev .    the scattering length for each coupled - channel situation is also shown in table  [ tab : tab2 ] to illustrate , as in other works @xcite , its correlation with the @xmath0 bond energy , which increases as the magnitude of the scattering length increases .",
    "this correlation is to be expected since @xmath61 is proportional to the t - matrix and @xmath62 is proportional to the corresponding medium modified g - matrix .",
    "we would also like to point out that the scattering length changes substantially for each of the coupled - channel cases .",
    "this is apparently different from the results shown in refs .",
    "@xcite but , as mentioned before , in these later works the interaction is readjusted in each coupled - channel calculation to reproduce a common value of the scattering length .",
    "finally , we collect in table  [ tab : tab3 ] the results of @xmath16 for the three observed @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "the role of coupled channels is qualitatively similar in the three hypernuclei : coupling the @xmath3 channel to the @xmath0 channel increases @xmath16 substantially , while the additional incorporation of the @xmath4 channel reduces the binding also substantially , bringing the value of the @xmath0 bond energy closer to the uncoupled result .",
    "we also observe that the heavier the nucleus the smaller the binding , contrary to what one would be expecting from the present experimental results . the trend found here is a reflection of the behavior of the @xmath46 g - matrix element shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gmat ] .",
    "inspecting the nuclear structure parameters for each hypernucleus shown in table  [ tab : tab1 ] , we see that the nuclear density for @xmath12he is the largest , slightly above 1.5@xmath63 , hence this hypernucleus has the strongest pauli repulsive effect .",
    "however , the starting energy @xmath23 is also the largest , which produces a gain in attraction . for the range of densities and starting energies explored by the three @xmath0 hypernuclear systems studied here ,",
    "the dependence of the g - matrix on the starting energy is twice more important than that on the density .",
    "the net effect is that the largest @xmath16 value is obtained for the lightest system .",
    "in this work we have obtained the bond energy @xmath1 in several @xmath0 hypernuclei , following a microscopic approach based on a g - matrix calculation in nuclear matter using , as @xmath5 interaction , the recent parameterization nsc97e of the nijmegen group .",
    "we have identified the @xmath0 bond energy with the @xmath46 @xmath0 g - matrix element calculated for values of the nuclear density and starting energy appropriate for each hypernucleus .",
    "our simplified finite - nucleus treatment has allowed us to explore in depth the effect of the various coupled channels and the importance of pauli blocking on the intermediate @xmath3 states , paying a special attention to the role of the @xmath4 channel usually neglected in the literature .",
    "consistently with other works , we find that the coupling between the @xmath3 and @xmath0 channels has a drastic effect , increasing by about 0.6 mev the calculated @xmath1 in @xmath12he with respect to a single - channel @xmath0 calculation .",
    "surprisingly , the additional incorporation of the @xmath4 channel yields a non - negligible reduction in the binding of 0.4 mev . it would be interesting to explore the role of the coupling to @xmath4 states in other three - channel @xmath5 interactions , such as the nijmegen hard - core potential f @xcite",
    "unfortunately , our momentum - space method can only handle soft - core interaction models .",
    "we have also explored , within the complete three - channel approach , the effect of pauli blocking , which is often neglected or considered in a truncated way in previous works . with respect to a t - matrix calculation ,",
    "our calculated value of @xmath1 in @xmath12he gets reduced by 0.26 mev , about half of what was found on the basis of a second order pauli corrected calculation @xcite .    due to our simplified treatment of nuclear structure",
    ", we do not expect a quantitative agreement with experimental data for the three hypernuclei studied .",
    "however , from the bulk of studies of double-@xmath7 hypernuclei available in the literature , it seems unreasonable to think that a proper finite nucleus calculation which incorporates consistently core - polarization effects , might change the calculated bond energies substantially enough to obtain a simultaneous agreement with the data . in this respect ,",
    "our results confirm , in accordance with recent cluster calculations @xcite , the incompatibility between the experimental binding energies of the light double-@xmath7 hypernuclear species .",
    "we note , however , that the disagreement would be reduced if the @xmath64 weak decay of the @xmath26be ground state was assumed to occur to the first excited state of @xmath65be , as pointed out by filikhin and gal @xcite , hence reducing the bond energy in @xmath26be to about 1 mev .",
    "a clarification of the experimental situation , through new experiments and analyses , is certainly needed in order to test the theoretical models and make progress in the field of doubly - strange systems .",
