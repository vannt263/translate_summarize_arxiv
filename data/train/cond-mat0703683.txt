    "among the different features that characterize complex physical systems , the most ubiquitous is the presence of @xmath0 noise in fluctuating physical variables@xcite .",
    "this means that the fourier power spectrum @xmath2 of fluctuations scales with frequency @xmath3 as @xmath4 .",
    "the power - law behavior often persists over several orders of magnitude with cutoffs present at both high and low frequencies .",
    "typical values of the exponent @xmath1 approximately range between 0.8 and 4 ( e.g. , see ref.@xcite and references therein ) , but in a loose terminology all these systems are said to exhibit @xmath5 `` noise '' .",
    "such a `` noise '' is found in a large variety of systems , e.g. , condensed matter systems(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) , freeway traffic@xcite , granular flow@xcite , dna sequence@xcite , heartbeat@xcite , ionic current fluctuations in membrane channels@xcite , river discharge@xcite , the number of stocks traded daily@xcite , chaotic quantum systems@xcite , the light of quasars@xcite , human cognition@xcite and coordination@xcite , burst errors in communication systems@xcite , electrical measurements@xcite , the electric noise in carbon nanotubes@xcite and in nanoparticle films@xcite , the occurrence of earthquakes@xcite etc . in some of these systems , the exponent @xmath1",
    "was reported to be very close to 1 , but good quality data supporting such a value exist in a few of them@xcite , e.g. , the voltage fluctuations when current flows through a resistor@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 behavior has been well understood on the basis of dynamic scaling observed at _ equilibrium _ critical points where the power - law correlations in time stem from the infinite - range correlations in space ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most of the observations mentioned above , however , refer to _ nonequilibrium _ phenomena for which -despite some challenging theoretical attempts@xcite- possible _ generic _ mechanisms leading to scale invariant fluctuations have not yet been identified . in other words , despite its ubiquity , there is no yet universal explanation about the phenomenon of the @xmath0 behavior .",
    "opinions have been expressed ( e.g. , see ref.@xcite ) that it does not arise as a consequence of particular physical interactions , but it is a generic manifestation of complex systems .",
    "it has been recently shown@xcite that novel dynamic features hidden behind the time series of complex systems can emerge if we analyze them in terms of a newly introduced time domain , termed natural time @xmath6 .",
    "it seems that this analysis enables the study of the dynamic evolution of a complex system and identifies when the system enters a critical stage .",
    "natural time domain is optimal@xcite for enhancing the signal s localization in the time frequency space , which conforms to the desire to reduce uncertainty and extract signal information as much as possible .",
    "the scope of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , a simple model is proposed ( section 2 ) which , in the frame of natural time analysis , leads to @xmath0 behavior with an exponent close to unity .",
    "second , we present the most recent experimental data on seismic electric signals ( ses ) which are transient low frequency ( @xmath7 ) signals observed before earthquakes @xcite , since they are emitted when the stress in the focal region reaches a critical value before the failure@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the original time series of the ses activities have been shown to obey a @xmath5-behavior@xcite . here in section 3 , we show that the ses activities observed in greece during the last months exhibit the features suggested , on the basis of natural time , to describe critical dynamics .",
    "such features have been found@xcite for laboratory data@xcite of the avalanches in a three dimensional pile of rice ( which is similar to the prototype example of sandpiles used in the proposal of the self - organized criticality , soc@xcite ) getting progressively closer to the critical state .    in a time series comprising @xmath8 events , the _ natural time _",
    "@xmath9 serves as an index@xcite for the occurrence of the @xmath10-th event .",
    "the evolution of the pair ( @xmath11 ) is studied@xcite , where @xmath12 denotes a quantity proportional to the energy released in the @xmath10-th event .",
    "for example , for dichotomous signals , which is frequently the case of ses activities , @xmath12 stands for the duration of the @xmath10-th pulse .",
    "the normalized power spectrum @xmath13 was introduced@xcite , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; @xmath17 stands for the _",
    "natural frequency_. the continuous function @xmath18 should _ not _ be confused with the usual discrete fourier transform , which considers only its values at @xmath19 . in natural time analysis , the properties of @xmath20 or @xmath21 are studied ( @xcite ) for natural frequencies @xmath17 less than 0.5 , since in this range of @xmath17 , @xmath20 or @xmath21 reduces ( @xcite ) to a _",
    "characteristic function _ for the probability distribution @xmath22 in the context of probability theory .",
    "when the system enters the _ critical _ stage , the following relation holds@xcite : @xmath23 for @xmath24 , eq.([fasma ] ) leads to@xcite @xmath25 which reflects@xcite that the variance of @xmath6 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the entropy @xmath28 in the natural time - domain is defined as@xcite @xmath29 which depends on the sequential order of events@xcite and for _ infinitely _ ranged temporal correlations its value is smaller@xcite than the value @xmath30 ) of a `` uniform '' distribution ( as defined in refs .",
    "@xcite , e.g. when all @xmath22 are equal or @xmath12 are positive indepedent and identically distributed random variable of finite variance ) , i.e.,@xmath31 .",
    "the same holds for the value of the entropy obtained@xcite upon considering the time reversal @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 , which is labelled by @xmath34 . in summary , the ses activities , when analyzed in natural time exhibit _ infinitely _ ranged temporal correlations and obey the conditions : @xmath35 and @xmath36 the validity of these conditions for the most recent electric field data will be investigated in section 3 .",
    "here , we present a simple competitive evolution model which results , when analyzed in natural time , to @xmath0 `` noise '' with @xmath1 very close to unity .",
    "let us consider the cardinality @xmath37 of the family of sets @xmath38 of successive extrema obtained from a given probability distribution function ( pdf ) ; @xmath39 equals to the empty set .",
    "each @xmath38 is obtained by following the procedure described below for n times .",
    "select a random number @xmath40 from a given pdf and compare it with all the numbers of @xmath41 . in order to construct the set @xmath42",
    ", we disregard from the set @xmath41 all its members that are smaller than @xmath40 and furthermore include @xmath40 .",
    "thus , @xmath42 is a finite set of real numbers whose members are always larger or equal to @xmath40 .",
    "moreover @xmath43 \\geq \\min[{\\rm s_{n-1}}]$ ] and @xmath44 \\geq \\max[{\\rm s_{n-1}}]$ ] .",
    "the cardinality @xmath45 of these sets , which may be considered as equivalent to the dimensionality of the thresholds distribution in the coherent noise model ( e.g. see ref.@xcite and references therein ) , if considered as time - series with respect to the natural number n ( see fig.[fmodel](a ) , which was drawn by means of the exponential pdf ) exhibits @xmath0 noise with @xmath1 very close to unity , see fig.[fmodel](b ) .",
    "this very simple model whose evolution is depicted in fig.[fmodel](a ) , leads to a detrended fluctuation analysis@xcite ( dfa ) exponent @xmath46 , see fig.[fmodel](c ) , being compatible with the @xmath5 power spectrum depicted in fig.[fmodel](b ) .",
    "the mathematical model described above corresponds to an asymptotically non - stationary process , since @xmath47 with a variance @xmath48 ( see fig.[fmodel](d ) ) , and this conforms to the fact that the dfa exponent is slightly larger than unity .",
    "we now discuss an analytical procedure which clarifies some properties of the model . in order to find analytically the distribution of the probabilities @xmath49 ,",
    "one has simply to consider the possible outcomes when drawing n random numbers @xmath40 .",
    "since the selection is made by a means of a pdf , all these numbers are different from each other , thus -when sorted they- are equivalent to n points ( sites ) lying on the real axis .",
    "the value of @xmath37 varies as @xmath50 permutate along these n sites _ independently _ from the pdf used in the calculation .",
    "thus , a detailed study of the permutation group of n objects can lead to an exact solution of the model .",
    "it is well known , however , that the number of the elements of this group is n ! and this explains why we preferred to use the numerical calculation shown in fig.[fmodel ] .",
    "some exact results obtained by this method are the following : @xmath51 ; @xmath52 , since @xmath53 ; @xmath54 , since @xmath55 and @xmath56 ; @xmath57 ( see fig.[x4 ] ) .",
    "figure [ x4 ] analyzes the results for @xmath58 ( fig.[x4](a ) ) and @xmath59 ( fig.[x4](b ) ) .",
    "one can see that the probability @xmath60 equals to the sum of the @xmath61 possible outcomes as @xmath40 moves from the left to right in the @xmath61 columns of fig.[x4 ] . in each column , the probability to have at the end @xmath62 is just equal to the probability to keep @xmath63 numbers from the numbers already drawn that are larger than @xmath40 .",
    "this results in @xmath64 using eq.([dom ] ) , one can prove that @xmath65 , which reflects that @xmath66 .",
    "we now proceed to the presentation of the most recent experimental data of ses activities recorded in greece by means of the procedure described in detail in refs.@xcite .",
    "figure [ f3 ] depicts four electrical disturbances that have been recently recorded at three measuring stations termed lamia ( lam ) , located at @xmath67 km north - west of athens , patras ( pat ) @xmath68 km west of athens , and keratea ( ker ) @xmath69 km east south - east of athens .",
    "the signals are presented here in normalized units , i.e. , subtracting the mean value and dividing the result by the standard deviation .",
    "the two electric signals in fig.[f3](a ) were recorded at lam on november 13 , 2006 and january 8 , 2007 , respectively , the latter being of larger actual amplitude than the former . in the upper panel of fig.[f3](b ) an electric signal recorded at pat on february 8 , 2007 is depicted , whereas in the lower panel we also insert -for the sake of comparison- the signal that was recorded at the same station almost one year ago , i.e. , on february 13 , 2006 .",
    "this recent signal , i.e. , the one on february 8 , 2007 , has an amplitude @xmath70% larger@xcite than that recorded one year ago which has been analyzed in ref.@xcite .",
    "its subsequent seismic activity in discussed in the appendix a ( while more recent ses activities are presented in appendix b ) .",
    "finally , in fig.[f3](c ) we depict a signal recorded at ker on february 11 , 2007 .",
    "all these four recent signals were analyzed in natural time and found to be consistent with the conditions ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , thus they can be classified@xcite as ses activities .",
    "for example , in the lowest panel of fig.[f4 ] we depict the evolution of the parameters @xmath71 , @xmath28 and @xmath34 for one of these signals , i.e. , the one recorded at ker on february 11 , 2007 .",
    "the leftmost panel of this figure shows the original time series ( along with its dichotomous presentation ) , while the rightmost panel indicates how the signal is read in natural time .",
    "note , in fig.[f4](c ) , that at @xmath72 ( i.e. , upon the completion of the signal ) @xmath71 reaches the value @xmath73 , while @xmath28 and @xmath34 are @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "thus , we have assured that , within the experimental uncertainty , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . furthermore , upon shuffling the @xmath12 randomly , we have found that , in all these four signals , the variance @xmath71 and the entropies @xmath78 turn to be equal to the values expected from a `` uniform '' distribution , which assures@xcite that their self - similarity solely stems from _ temporal _ correlations .",
    "in summary , using the newly introduced concept of natural time:(a ) a simple model is proposed that exhibits @xmath0 behavior with @xmath1 close to unity and ( b ) electric signals , recorded during the last few months in greece , are classified as ses activities since they exhibit _ infinitely _ ranged temporal correlations .",
    "this excludes any possibility of attributing these signals to nearby man - made sources , because the latter have _ weaker _ temporal correlations ( i.e. , their hurst exponent lies usually in the range 0.5 to 0.75@xcite ) .",
    "according to the athens observatory ( the seismic data of which will be used here ) , a series of strong earthquakes ( eqs ) with magnitudes ranging from 5.0 to 6.0-units occurred as follows : first , a 6.0 eq at kefallonia area , i.e. , @xmath79n @xmath80e , at 13:57 ut on march 25 , 2007 .",
    "second , a cluster of four magnitude class 5.0 eqs on april 10 , 2007 with an epicenter close to trichonida lake , i.e. , around @xmath81n @xmath82e .",
    "we show that the occurrence time of the impending strong eq activity can be estimated by following the procedure described in refs.@xcite , as it was indicated in ref.@xcite .",
    "( we clarify that , during the last decade , preseismic information based on ses activities is issued _ only _ when the magnitude of the strongest eq of the impending eq activity is estimated to be -by means of the ses amplitude[38 - 40,52,53]- comparable to 6.0 units or larger@xcite . )",
    "we study how the seismicity evolved after the recording of the ses activity at pat on february 8 , 2007 , by considering either the area a:@xmath83 or its smaller area b:@xmath84 , which surround the eq epicenters and the pat station ( see fig.[af1](a ) ) .",
    "if we set the natural time for seismicity zero at the initiation of the ses activity on february 8 , 2007 , we form time series of seismic events in natural time for various time windows as the number @xmath8 of consecutive ( small ) eqs increases . we then compute the normalized power spectrum in natural time @xmath85 for each of the time windows .",
    "excerpt of these results , which refers to the values deduced during the period from 20:53:59 ut on march 19 to 11:56:30 ut on 25 march , 2007 , is depicted in red in fig.[af2](a ) .",
    "this figure corresponds to the area b with magnitude threshold ( hereafter referring to the local magnitude ml or the ` duration ' magnitude md ) @xmath86 . in the same figure ,",
    "we plot in blue the power spectrum obeying the relation ( 2 ) which holds , as mentioned , when the system enters the _ critical _ stage ( @xmath87 , where @xmath17 stands for the natural frequency ) . the date and the time of the occurrence of each small earthquake ( with magnitude exceeding ( or equal to ) the aforementioned threshold ) that occurred in area b ,",
    "is also written in red in each panel .",
    "an inspection of this figure reveals that the red line approaches the blue line as @xmath8 increases and a _ coincidence _ occurs at the last small event which had a magnitude 3.2 and occurred at 11:56:30 ut on march 25 , 2007 , i.e. , just two hours before the strong 6.0 eq . to ensure that this coincidence is a _ true _",
    "one ( see also below ) we also calculate the evolution of the quantities @xmath71,@xmath28 and @xmath88 and the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ af2](b ) and [ af2](c ) for the same magnitude thresholds for each of the areas b and a , respectively .    the conditions for a coincidence to be considered as _ true _",
    "are the following ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "[ 30 , 48 , 49 , 55,56 ] ) : first , the ` average ' distance @xmath89 between the empirical and the theoretical @xmath90(i.e . , the red and the blue line , respectively , in fig.[af2](a ) ) should be smaller than @xmath91 .",
    "[ af2](b),(c ) where we plot @xmath89 versus the conventional time for the aforementioned two areas b and a , respectively .",
    "second , in the examples observed to date , a few events _ before _ the coincidence leading to the strong eq , the evolving @xmath90 has been found to approach that of the relation ( 2 ) , i.e. , the blue one in fig.[af2](a ) , from _ below _",
    "this reflects that during this approach the @xmath71-value decreases as the number of events increases ) .",
    "in addition , both values @xmath28 and @xmath88 should be smaller than @xmath92 at the coincidence . finally , since the process concerned is self - similar ( _ critical _ dynamics ) , the time of the occurrence of the ( true ) coincidence should _ not _ change , in principle , upon changing the ( surrounding ) area used in the calculation .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ af2](b ) , upon the occurrence of the aforementioned last small event at 11:56:30 ut of march 25 , 2007 , in area b the @xmath89 value becomes smaller than @xmath91 .",
    "the same was found to hold for the area a ( see fig.[af2](c ) ) .",
    "an inspection of fig .",
    "[ af2](c ) shows that upon the occurrence of the four magnitude class 5.0 eqs on april 10 , 2007 , the parameters @xmath71 , @xmath28 , and @xmath34 jumped to values larger than those of the `` uniform '' distribution and then started to decrease again . among these parameters ,",
    "however , @xmath28 still remains appreciably higher than @xmath92 , while @xmath34 it already became smaller than @xmath92 and @xmath71 gradually approaches 0.070 .    in order to elucidate the situation",
    ", we proceeded to the additional study of two areas c and d , which did _ not _ include the epicenters of the eqs at kefallonia and trichonida lake , i.e. , c : @xmath93 and its smaller region d : @xmath94 .",
    "the corresponding parameters are depicted in fig.[af3 ] , which exhibit the following interesting feature : they gradually decrease , thus approaching the aforementioned values that characterize the proximity to the critical point ( cp ) . the occurrence of the next few small events in these areas will reveal whether cp will be finally reached or not .",
    "this study is still in progress .    the interesting feature seen in fig .",
    "[ af3 ] seems to conform with the following fact : just on april 23 , 2007 , a _",
    "ses ( in the sense discussed in ref .",
    "52 ) was recorded ( fig .",
    "[ af4](a ) ) which was followed by an ses activity ( fig .",
    "[ af4](b ) ) . comparing the actual amplitude of this single ses to that of the ses activity recorded on february 8 , 2007 ( fig .",
    "[ af4](c ) ) , we find that it is evidently stronger .",
    "at 01:34 ut on may 7,2007 an eq of magnitude 5.1 occurred with an epicenter at @xmath95n@xmath96e depicted with a star in fig.[af5](a ) .",
    "it actually lies within the areas d , c ( fig.[af1](b ) ) which exhibited the interesting feature discussed in advance in fig.[af3 ] .                concerning the electrical data : beyond the electrical recordings on april 23 , 2007 depicted in fig.[af4](a),(b ) ,",
    "two additional electric signals have been recorded at pat on april 24 , 2007 ( fig.[af6](a ) ) and april 18 , 2007 ( fig.[af6](b ) ) ; which have an amplitude markedly larger than that on february 13 , 2006 ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "these have been classified as ses activities after analyzing them in natural time and applying the relevant criteria .",
    "for example , if we read in natural time the signal on april 24 , 2007 ( fig.[af6](d ) ) -the dichotomous representation of which is marked by the dotted ( blue ) line in fig.[af6](c)- we find the values @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 which do obey the conditions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "we now investigate the seismicity after the aforementioned three ses activities on april 18 , april 23 and april 24 , 2007 .",
    "the investigation is made in the areas d and e ( fig.[af5](b ) ) , the latter being almost equal to the former region c but slightly extended to the east , i.e. , e : n@xmath100e@xmath101 .",
    "starting the computation of seismicity from the initiation of the ses activity on april 18 , 2007 , we obtain the results depicted in figs.[af7](a ) and [ af7](b ) for the areas d and e , respectively .",
    "an inspection of the parameters @xmath89 , @xmath71,@xmath28 and @xmath34 reveals that they exhibited a _ true _ coincidence (",
    "as discussed in appendix a ) around april 30 , 2007 , i.e. , around one week before the 5.1 eq on may 7 , 2007 mentioned above .",
    "this study of the evolution of seismicity in the areas d , e still continues .    in view of the fact that three ses activities ( april 18 , 23 and 24 , 2007 ) have been observed with different polarities ( see fig.[af4](a ) and figs.[af6](a),(b ) ) while only one strong eq has occurred to date , our investigation is also currently extended to the area f : n@xmath100e@xmath102 ( which is a sub - region of e to the east of pat ) .",
    "this study is still in progress in order to discriminate whether this area may approach cp or not .",
    "as mentioned in the previous appendix , we _ also _ currently study the area f : n@xmath103 e@xmath104 shown in fig.[cf1 ] . starting the calculation from the initiation of the ses on april 18 , 2007 ( fig.[af6](b ) ) the resulting parameters ( until 02:22:17 ut on may 14 , 2007 ) @xmath89 , @xmath71 , @xmath28 , and @xmath34 from the computation of seismicity are shown in fig.[cf2](a ) , for @xmath105 .",
    "to investigate the spatial invariance , we also give in fig.[cf2](b ) the relevant results for a subregion g of f , i.e. , g : n@xmath103 e@xmath106 .",
