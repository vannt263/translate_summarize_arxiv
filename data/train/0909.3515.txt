    "the cosmic microwave background s ( cmb ) ability to constrain the cosmological parameters has driven a large variety of cmb experiments .",
    "the high quality measurements of the temperature and polarization of the cmb are compatible with a flat universe with nearly scale invariant fluctuations .",
    "the sensitivity to small angular scales of recent experiments such as wmap5  @xcite , acbar  @xcite and cbi  @xcite give us a better understanding of anisotropies from local large scale structure ( lss ) and from non - linear effects such as weak gravitational lensing .",
    "the non - gaussianity of these fluctuations can have an effect in the estimation of the cosmological parameters , especially for future experiments .",
    "however , possible non - gaussian effects have not been considered in previous analyses , under the assumption that they are negligible .",
    "non - gaussianities show up as contributions to the four - point correlation function , or trispectrum in fourier space , of the cmb temperature fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the four point correlations quantify the sample variance and covariance of the two point correlation of power spectrum measurements  @xcite . to adequately understand the statistical measurements of cmb anisotropy fluctuations a proper understanding of the four point contributions",
    "is needed .",
    "given the high precision level of cosmological parameter measurements by current and future surveys , a careful consideration must be attached to understanding the presence of non - gaussian signals at the four point level .",
    "the goal of this paper is to understand to what extent these non - gaussianities affect constraints on the cosmological parameters    as explored in previous work ( e.g.  @xcite ) , one of the most important non - linear contributions to cmb temperature fluctuations results from weak gravitational lensing .",
    "contributions to the four point level arise from the non - linear mode - coupling nature of the lensing effect , as well as correlations between weak lensing angular deflections and secondary effects that trace the same large scale structure .",
    "the trispectrum due to lensing alone is studied in  @xcite , and further considered under an all - sky formulation in  @xcite .    in our analysis",
    "we include contributions to the trispectrum from three well known secondary sources .",
    "first , we consider the contribution of the trispectrum to the power spectrum covariance due to lensing .",
    "we also consider contributions from the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( isw ;  @xcite ) and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sz ;  @xcite ) , both which cross - correlate with lensing to produce non - gaussianity .",
    "each of these effects becomes non - negligible on small angular scales and must be taken into account for a more complete treatment of cosmological parameter constraints .",
    "in a situation without instrumental noise , the lensing contribution to the trispectrum can increase the values along the diagonal of the covariance matrix on the order of about @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the sz contributions are greater than the lensing by as much as an order of magnitude . however , with noise added follows the possibility that these effects on the trispectrum become negligible .",
    "most experiments thus far have been too noisy at small angular scales to observe these non - gaussian effects on the cosmological parameters .",
    "we explore how firmly this holds for the acbar and cbi data sets when combined with wmap five - year data as well for future planck and cmbpol measurements .",
    "moreover , we consider the weak lensing scaling parameter @xmath3 in our analysis .",
    "this parameter scales the power spectrum of the cmb lensing potential @xmath4 such that @xmath5 corresponds to an unlensed scenario , whereas @xmath6 renders the expected lensed result .",
    "it was first reported that in an analysis of the acbar data set this parameter is incompatible with the expected value of @xmath6 at @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "acbar has since updated their data set with a new calibration , and the acbar team finds that the amplitude is consistent with the expected value of unity @xcite .",
    "however , given that this parameter is sensitive to physics at high multipoles , such as that encapsulated in the trispectrum , we also include @xmath3 as an extra parameter in our calculations .",
    "our analysis of the acbar and cbi data sets , combined with wmap 5-year data , show that secondary contributions in the trispectrum have a negligible effect on the uncertainties of the cosmological parameters .",
    "at most the constraints on the cosmological parameters change by no more than 10% .",
    "we find that these modifications are negligible due to the increase in noise at large multipoles ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_noise ] ) .",
    "however , in a mock planck data set with realistic noise contributions , the non - gaussian effects coming from the trispectrum become more important , with error constraint degradations up to @xmath0 ( as shown in table [ tab : planck ] ) .",
    "for the case of cmbpol this rises to @xmath8 . for this reason , future experiments with at least planck - level sensitivity at high @xmath9 should consider non - gaussianities from the trispectrum in order to have proper error bar estimates .",
    "lastly , we show @xmath3 to be consistent with the expected value of unity , primarily due to the same reasons that ref .",
    "@xcite found it to be consistent with the theoretically expected value .",
    "if we had used the original acbar dataset , prior to their most recent update , we find that @xmath3 is inconsistent with unity at the same confidence as found by ref .",
    "we also find that this parameter remains consistent with unity when both trispectrum effects and the running @xmath10 of the spectral index @xmath11 are included in the analysis .    in  [ sec",
    ": analysis ] , we review the calculation for the trispectrum contribution to the covariance matrix . in  [ sec : results ] , we calculate the impact of the trispectrum on the cosmological parameters for current and future experiments considering a set of parameter configurations . the fiducial cosmologies considered can be found in table  [ tab : fiducial ] . in  [ sec : summary ] , we conclude with a summary .",
    "we begin with a review of how to calculate the various contributions of the trispectrum to the covariance matrix . for a comprehensive introduction and derivation of these equations ,",
    "see  @xcite .    in the flat sky approximation ,",
    "the power spectrum and trispectrum are defined via : @xmath12    in computing these quantities the band powers are obtained , as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the area of 2d shell in multipole space , @xmath15 is the @xmath16 window function and the subscript @xmath17 stands for the @xmath16 shell in multipole space over which we are integrating .",
    "the signal covariance matrix @xmath18 is given by    @xmath19\\,,\\\\ t^{{\\theta}}_{ij}&= & \\int { d^2 l_i w_i \\over a_{{{\\rm s}}_i } } \\int { d^2 l_j w_j \\over a_{{{\\rm s}}_j } } { l_i^2 l_j^2 \\over ( 2\\pi)^2 } t^{{\\theta}}({{\\mathbf{l}}}_i,-{{\\mathbf{l}}}_i,{{\\mathbf{l}}}_j,-{{\\mathbf{l}}}_j)\\ , , \\label{eqn : variance}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 is the survey area in steradians .",
    "the first term of the covariance matrix @xmath18 is the gaussian contribution to the sample variance and includes , in addition to the primary component , contributions through lensing and secondary effects .",
    "the second term @xmath21 represents the non - gaussian contributions contained in the trispectrum .",
    "the surveys we consider also include instrumental noise .",
    "the noise is incorporated into our gaussian variance as an additional contribution to the power spectrum @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the power spectrum of the detector and other sources of noise introduced by the experiment .",
    "these noise contributions are included in respective experiment s publicly released data and significantly impact the covariance matrix , in particular on small angular scales .    for the power spectrum covariance , we are interested in the case where @xmath24 with @xmath25 , and @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "these conditions render parallelograms for the trispectrum configuration in fourier space .    to account for the lensing contribution to the trispectrum , we must compute @xmath28 ^ 2 + c_{|{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_i-{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_j|}^{{{\\phi\\phi } } } \\left [ ( { { \\bf \\hat{l}}}_i-{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_j)\\cdot { { \\bf \\hat{l}}}_i\\right]^2 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & c_{l_j}^{{\\theta}}c_{l_j}^{{\\theta}}\\left [ c_{|{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_i+{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_j|}^{{{\\phi\\phi } } } \\left [ ( { { \\bf \\hat{l}}}_i+{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_j)\\cdot { { \\bf \\hat{l}}}_j\\right]^2 + c_{|{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_i-{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_j|}^{{{\\phi\\phi } } } \\left [ ( { { \\bf \\hat{l}}}_i-{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_j)\\cdot { { \\bf \\hat{l}}}_j\\right]^2 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & 2c_{l_i}^{{\\theta}}c_{l_j}^{{\\theta}}\\big [ c_{|{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_i+{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_j|}^{{{\\phi\\phi } } }   ( { { \\bf \\hat{l}}}_i+{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_j)\\cdot { { \\bf \\hat{l}}}_i({{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_i+{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_j)\\cdot { { \\bf \\hat{l}}}_j \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad \\quad - c_{|{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_i-{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_j|}^{{{\\phi\\phi } } } ( { { \\bf \\hat{l}}}_i-{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_j)\\cdot { { \\bf \\hat{l}}}_i ( { { \\bf \\hat{l}}}_i-{{\\bf \\hat{l}}}_j)\\cdot { { \\bf \\hat{l}}}_j \\big ] \\ , , \\label{eqn : lentri}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the tt power spectrum and @xmath30 is the lensing power spectrum .",

    "in addition to the lensing contributions to the trispectrum above , we consider contributions from the inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons . the sz contribution to the trispectrum",
    "is given by  @xcite :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the spectral function of the sz effect , @xmath35 is the comoving volume of the universe integrated to a redshift of @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the virial mass such that @xmath38 = [ 11,16]$ ] , @xmath39 is the mass function of dark matter halos as rendered by  @xcite utilizing the linear transfer function of  @xcite , and @xmath40 is the dimensionless two - dimensional fourier transform of the projected compton @xmath41-parameter , given via the limber approximation @xcite by :    @xmath42    where the scaled radius @xmath43 and @xmath44 such that @xmath45 is the angular diameter distance and @xmath46 is the scale radius of the three - dimensional radial profile @xmath47 of the compton @xmath41-parameter .",
    "this profile is a function of the gas density and temperature profiles as modeled in @xcite .",
    "hence , we incorporate the contributions obtained from the sz effect along with those from lensing , lensing - isw , and lensing - sz effects to the covariance matrix in eqn",
    ".  3 .",
    "to first order in @xmath48 , the weak lensing of the cmb anisotropy trispectrum can be expressed as the convolution of the power spectrum of the unlensed temperature @xmath49 and that of the weak lensing potential @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the lensing potential power spectrum can be parameterized by the scaling parameter @xmath3 , defined as @xmath51    thus , @xmath3 is a measure of the degree to which the expected amount of lensing appears in the cmb , such that a theory with @xmath52 is devoid of lensing , while @xmath53 renders a theory with the canonical amount of lensing .",
    "any inconsistency with unity represents an unexpected amount of lensing that needs to be explained with new physics , such as dark energy or modified gravity @xcite .",
    "the impact of this scaling parameter on the lensed cmb temperature power spectrum can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : al ] .",
    "qualitatively , @xmath3 smoothes out the peaks in the power spectrum and can therefore also be viewed as a smoothing parameter in addition to its scaling property . given that @xmath3 primarily affects the temperature power spectrum on small angular scales",
    ", we also explore the possibility that it deviates from unity as secondary non - gaussianities are accounted for in the analysis .",
    ".fiducial model used to generate @xmath29 and @xmath54 in camb for acbar and cbi . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : cmbpol ]    table  [ tab : orig ] shows the extent to which the trispectrum contributions affect the constraints on cosmological parameters for acbar and cbi data sets combined with wmap five - year data .",
    "the trispectrum has a negligible impact on the cosmological parameters for these simulations . for the cases where the weak lensing scaling parameter and the running of the spectral index",
    "are included the constraints on the cosmological parameters change by less than 10% .      using a prior acbar dataset",
    ", it was found that the weak lensing scaling parameter @xmath3 is inconsistent with the expected value of unity at @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "this led to an apparent revision by the acbar team and resulting in a recalibration of the data .",
    "this apparently removed the result first demonstrated by calabrese et al . @xcite and the acbar team s own revised analysis showed @xmath3 to be consistent with unity at a significance around 1.1@xmath55 @xcite .",
    "however , given that this parameter is strongly sensitive to small angular scales where other secondary anisotropies contribute and non - gaussianities become important , we have also chosen to include this parameter into our analysis .",
    "we have explicitly carried out two runs with this scaling parameter .",
    "for the first run , we incorporated @xmath3 without any assumption of priors or the addition of other parameters , as shown in table  [ tab : orig ] .",
    "we find @xmath3 to be consistent with unity at @xmath56 , for the same reasons that the acbar team found this parameter to be consistent with the theoretical value in the fiducial cosmological model .",
    "for the second simulation , in addition to @xmath3 , we incorporated secondary non - gaussianities and allowed the spectral index to run as this parameter is sensitive to physics on small scales .",
    "however , the constraint on the lensing amplitude remains unaffected .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that non - gaussian effects are partly responsible for the inconsistency of the scaling parameter with unity , and future data sets with less noise on small angular scales are required to determine this .      in order to understand the extent to which the trispectrum impacts the cosmological parameters in a prospective survey with less noise , we created tt mock datasets assuming the best fit wmap5 cosmological parameters , with the optical depth fixed at @xmath57 , and with noise properties consistent with planck s 143 ghz channel .",
    "instead of considering cross - correlations , we only use the diagonal entries of the binned covariance matrix .",
    "table  [ tab : planck ] shows the results of the planck mock simulation .",
    "since planck has significantly less noise at high @xmath9 , the trispectrum effects on the cosmological parameters is more apparent and the confidence regions of the most extreme changes are seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] . here , the 1@xmath55 parameter constraints weaken by up to 20% .",
    "thus , the trispectrum has a more significant impact for measuring the constraints on the cosmological parameters in experiments with a noise - level comparable to that of planck on small angular scales .    furthermore , in anticipation of cmbpol  @xcite , which should have noise an order of magnitude less than planck , we have carried out a mock cmbpol - like run with noise estimates consistent with the epic concept mission @xcite .",
    "the results of this run are seen in table  [ tab : cmbpol ] . for surveys with noise level comparable to that of cmbpol , non - gaussian contributions in the trispectrum",
    "weaken the parameter constraints by up to 30% .",
    "we have included in table  [ tab : planck ] and table  [ tab : cmbpol ] the parameter shifts induced in one realization of the mock cmb spectrum .",
    "although the size of the parameter shifts extend up to 1.5@xmath55 , the shifts are not statistically significant as errors are correlated .",
    "we expect that for a set of realizations the shifts will cancel on average .",
    "secondary non - gaussianities in the trispectrum from weak lensing , the isw effect , and the sz effect have the potential to weaken the constraints on the cosmological parameters in experiments with high enough sensitivity to physics on small angular scales . while recent experiments such as acbar and cbi are too noisy for the trispectrum to become important at large multipoles , future surveys need to incorporate the trispectrum to avoid over - confident parameter estimation .",
    "the underlying cosmology constrained by planck suffers a 20% degradation when these secondary contributions to the temperature anisotropies are properly incorporated , and this rises to 30% in cmbpol .",
    "accounting for secondary non - gaussianities in our analysis shows the weak lensing scaling parameter to be consistent with unity at @xmath58 .",
