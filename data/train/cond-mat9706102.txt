    "rough surfaces and interfaces appear in many situations in nature .",
    "deposition , erosion , fluid - fluid displacement in porous media or fire front motion , are important examples @xcite in which an interface kinetically becomes rough .",
    "a rough interface in dimension @xmath5 ( d is the substrate dimension ) , which is described by its height @xmath6 at position @xmath7 and time @xmath8 , has been treated as a self - affine fractal . in the case of interfaces driven by spatio - temporal noise",
    "the temporal evolution of @xmath6 is given by the stochastic equations of edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite and kardar - parisi - zhang @xcite , which have been widely studied .",
    "the effect of quenched disorder ( _ i.e. _ a noise frozen in time ) on the interface dynamics is a more difficult problem and up to now there is not a complete and consistent picture .",
    "an important feature of the quenched disorder is that the interface can be dominated by pinning forces , which can slow down the motion of the interface in large regions .",
    "pinning phenomena have a considerable importance in problems like the immiscible displacement of fluids in porous media or the motion of domain walls in magnetic systems .    during the last years much effort",
    "has been paid to this subject , but theory , simulations and experiments are not yet in good agreement ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) . in this paper",
    "we wish to show that the reason for this disagreement is certainly twofold . on the one hand ,",
    "growth processes do not always generate truly self - affine interfaces @xcite and different scaling behaviours may appear at short and large length scales . on the other hand",
    ", the quenched disorder introduces a new length scale , related to the size of pinned regions that becomes relevant and , as we will see later , changes the usual scaling laws .    the simplest stochastic differential equation that describes the evolution of the interface height in the presence of quenched randomness is the so - called quenched edwards - wilkinson ( qew ) equation : @xmath9 which is similar to the ew equation but with a quenched disorder term , @xmath10 . the external driving force",
    "@xmath11 controls completely the dynamics of the front . if @xmath11 is larger than a critical force @xmath12 , the interface moves with a finite velocity",
    "however , the interface remains pinned by the disorder for @xmath13 . the critical point @xmath14",
    "is known as depinning transition . above the depinning transition",
    ", @xmath15 , a characteristic length , @xmath16 , appears .",
    "@xmath16 represents the typical size of the pinned regions of the interface and close to the transition scales as @xmath17 . as we will discuss later",
    ", @xmath16 is very important to understand the scaling of the interface near the depinning transition .",
    "the _ global _ interface width , which characterizes the scaling of the advancing front , is defined by @xmath18 where brackets are averages over the whole system and @xmath19 ... @xmath20 over realizations of the disorder . in the usual case ,",
    "when the only relevant length is the system size , the width scales with time for the early times regime and saturates at long times : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the roughness exponent and @xmath23 is the time exponent .",
    "this scaling picture is known as family - vicsek scaling ansatz @xcite .",
    "the saturation time @xmath24 depends on the system size @xmath25 because it is the time in which the horizontal correlation length @xmath26 reaches the system size .",
    "the exponent @xmath27 is called dynamic exponent and the scaling relation @xmath28 is fulfilled .",
    "an alternative way of determining the roughness exponent @xmath22 is frecuently used in simulations because of the long wait needed to get saturation in large systems , in which simulations are done .",
    "the width is calculated over a window of length @xmath29 and averaged over many pieces with the same length along the interface .",
    "in other words , we can study the scaling of the _ local _ width @xmath30 the local width scales in a similar manner as the global width and has a short time regime @xmath31 . for small length scales ( or equivalently at long times ) , @xmath32 , the local width is believed to be independent of time and to scale as @xmath33 this method is very useful when one has no possibility of producing interfaces in different system sizes as occurs in real experiments .",
    "most theoretical growth models generate _ self - affine _ interfaces and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "much work has been carried out to obtain the critical exponents at the depinning transition .",
    "the roughness exponent has been the most controversial .",
    "experiments performed in @xmath35 @xcite , which are believed to be described by eq.([qew ] ) , gave roughness exponents around 0.75 - 0.9 in disagreement with a renormalization group prediction @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "a scaling theory @xcite gave an effective roughness exponent 0.8 in good agreement with the model reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "a number of numerical models for interface pinning by quenched disorder have been investigated .",
    "roux and hansen @xcite found two different exponents : @xmath37 when the local width was used , and @xmath38 looking at the scaling of the global width as a function of the system size .",
    "results reported by jensen @xcite , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are similar .",
    "makse and amaral @xcite obtained @xmath41 or @xmath42 depending on the method that they used . also other numerical determinations of @xmath43 gave values around 0.8 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the reason for the existence of two different roughness exponents is the _ super - rough _ character of the interface close to the depinning transition . in ref.@xcite",
    "was already shown that the local width is bounded by @xmath44 and for that , it is just _ technically _ imposible to measure a roughness exponent larger than one using the local width . on the contrary",
    "the global width does not have this restriction so that it gives the _ true _ roughness exponent . however , we would like to note here that there also exist other effects @xcite that may lead to the same anomalous scaling in surfaces even with @xmath45 .",
    "our aim in this paper is to show that the local width suffers a temporal crossover , instead of saturating , associated with a different interface scaling at short , @xmath29 , and long , @xmath46 , length scales .",
    "the scaling properties of the interface can not be correctly described by the usual dynamic scaling hypothesis .",
    "we will see that a super - rough dynamic scaling gives the correct scaling of the front .",
    "we begin by performing a numerical integration of the qew equation in @xmath35 to study the scaling behaviour of the local and global widths .",
    "to start we have to discretize the qew equation in the horizontal direction @xmath47 ) \\right ) , \\label{qewdisc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath48 , being @xmath25 the size of the system .",
    "@xmath49 $ ] represents the integer part of @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 are the boundary conditions .",
    "this is the usual discretization scheme used by many authors @xcite .",
    "the random field @xmath53 is gaussian and its correlation @xmath54 .",
    "hence the noise is uncorrelated from a cell to another one and stands for the time of a run .",
    "the time step @xmath55 ( we used @xmath56 in all our simulations ) and the size @xmath25 have to be chosen in such a way that the qew equation is obtained in the continuous limit ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) .",
    "so , the following conditions must be verified : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "one has to check that changing these parameters does not affect the final numerical result . following kessler _",
    "@xcite we distributed disorder sites randomly with a prefixed density @xmath62 over the network .",
    "so , the disorder is nonzero with probability @xmath62 and on these sites disorder is distributed according to a gaussian distribution .",
    "the scaling exponents do not depend on the actual value of @xmath62 but the crossover effects will be clearer for small values of @xmath62 .",
    "as we were looking for crossover regimes , we used @xmath63 in all our numerical simulations .",
    "we worked with networks of size @xmath64 , and the results were averaged over 15 - 50 realizations of disorder . as expected we found a critical driving force @xmath12 that separates the pinning and depinning phases .",
    "the value of @xmath12 depends on the actual values of the parameters of simulation ( @xmath62 , @xmath65 , @xmath25 ) . for @xmath63 , @xmath56 , @xmath66 , and",
    "@xmath64 we estimated @xmath67 .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the global width has two different time regimes .",
    "close to the transition , @xmath68 , the width behaves as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the time exponent near the critical point .",
    "far from the pinning transition , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and the time exponent @xmath73 corresponds to the time exponent of the ew equation . as we will see later , the values of the remaining exponents @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath27 indicate that the interface dynamics clearly belong to the ew universality class in the limit of large driving forces .    in general , the temporal behaviour of the global width is well understood near and far from the depinning transition and it has been analyzed by many authors @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", we focus here on the scaling behaviour of the local width .",
    "firstly , as far as time evolution is concerned , in the strong pushing regime the local width scales with time for early times and saturates at time @xmath74 as corresponds to the family - vicsek scaling picture ( see fig.1 ) . the value of the width at saturation can be used to determine the roughness exponent .",
    "we found that the saturated local width , @xmath75 , scales as @xmath76 ( see fig.1 inset ) .",
    "thus , for large driving forces the exponents ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) of the ew universality class are obtained , as expected @xcite .      at the critical value , @xmath14 , the complete scaling description of the local width is much less trivial than in the strong pushing limit discussed above . in fig.2",
    "we display the time evolution of the local width @xmath79 for different window sizes @xmath80 .",
    "after an early time regime , the local width crosses over to @xmath1 , where the asymptotic time exponent is @xmath81 . this scaling region becomes shorter as the length scale is larger , @xmath82 .",
    "moreover , there is no saturation of local widths at times @xmath0 , contrary to what is generally thought saturation of the local width occurs only when the whole system saturates ( _ i.e. _ @xmath83 for any @xmath80 ) . as we did in fig.1 for the strong pushing limit , we can use the saturated values of the local width in fig.2 to determine the local roughness exponent ( see fig.2 inset ) , @xmath84 . from fig.2",
    "it is clear that the dynamic behaviour of the interface near the depinning transition can not be completely described with a family - vicsek scaling ansatz . according to this scaling picture the local width",
    "@xmath79 should saturate when the horizontal correlation length reaches the size of the sample , @xmath85 , as occurs in the strong pushing limit ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "however , the local width displayed in fig.2 scales with time for length scales @xmath32 and a new time exponent @xmath86 has to be introduced .",
    "this anomalous time regime of @xmath79 has been observed in other growth processes and termed the problem of _ anomalous _ kinetic roughening in the literature @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have shown that for a broad class of growth processes the scaling for @xmath32 is actually given by @xmath87 when a local exponent @xmath88 exists , _",
    "i.e. _ when anomalous roughening occurs .",
    "this gives rise to an anomalous temporal regime with @xmath89 .",
    "only when the interface is self - affine one has @xmath90 and the family - vicsek scaling for the local width is recovered .",
    "as demonstrated in ref.@xcite this may occur for growth with @xmath22 below or above one and thus it is not necessarily associated with super - roughening .",
    "more precisely , super - roughening corresponds to an anomalous scaling like ( [ anomal - scal ] ) , but @xmath91 and so @xmath92 in this particular case . at true saturation , when @xmath93 , the local width scales as @xmath94 that corresponds to the anomalous dependence of the local width on the system size already observed in simulation @xcite .",
    "next , we are going to show that for the qew model ( [ qew ] ) the anomalous scaling behaviour of the local width at the depinning transition is also given by eq.([anomal - scal ] ) with @xmath91 in this case . in figure 3",
    "we plot a collapse of the data of fig .",
    "an inspection of fig .",
    "3 reveals that the dynamic scaling form of the local width is consistent with @xmath95 the scaling function is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the exponents giving the best data collapse .",
    "this scaling behavior leads to a local width @xmath100 in the intermediate regime @xmath101 that corresponds to the scaling proposed in ( [ anomal - scal ] ) with @xmath102 ( to be compared with our previous determination @xmath81 ) . in agreement with other authors",
    "@xcite , we thus found @xmath98 , @xmath99 and a global roughness exponent @xmath103 from the data collapse shown in fig .",
    "similar results were obtained when the structure factor was used .",
    "the structure factor , which is related to the fourier transform of the height - height correlation function can be used to obtain the critical exponents @xmath104 where @xmath105 \\exp(ikx)$ ] and the scaling function is @xmath106 whenever the interface satisfies a standard family - vicsek scaling . also in the case of anomalous scaling due to super - roughening , eq.([s ] )",
    "gives the correct scaling of the structure factor ( see [ 5b ] for details ) .",
    "we have determined the structure factor at the depinning transition by performing simulations of eq.([qew ] ) in a system of total size @xmath107 and a density of pinning sites @xmath108 .",
    "for this system size , the critical force was found to be @xmath109 .",
    "figure 4 shows the data collapse for the exponents @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( and then @xmath112 ) in agreement with the exponents that we found in figure 3 .",
    "there is another point that merits some discussion related to the complete scaling of the qew model . from figs . 2 and 3 we have obtained a value for the dynamic exponent @xmath113 in agreement with several previous simulations @xcite of the qew equation ( and related models ) in which an exponent @xmath114 was reported .",
    "however , in these numerical works @xmath27 was always calculated from the scaling relation @xmath115 , as we have done in this paper . in principle , in order to correctly determine the dynamic exponent @xmath27 one should be able to use its definition in @xmath26 , where the correlation length @xmath116 can be obtained from an appropriate correlation function .",
    "let us consider the height correlation function @xmath117 which relates the heights at two positions @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "this correlation function becomes zero at distances @xmath80 larger than the correlation length , thus @xmath116 can be determined from @xmath120 note that eq.([corre - leng ] ) should be the correct way of obtaining @xmath27 while we are interested in checking the validity of the dynamic scaling ansatz .",
    "direct determination of the dynamic exponent from eq.([corre - leng ] ) was reported in ref.@xcite , where @xmath121 for a wide range of driving forces even at the transition ( here the prime denotes a direct measure using eq.([corre - leng ] ) ) .",
    "surprisingly , the value of the exponent @xmath121 obtained in this way differs from the one that we have measured by an _ indirect _",
    "method @xmath114 ( and consecuently the corresponding global roughness exponents @xmath4 and @xmath122 are different as well ) .",
    "a value of the dynamic exponent @xmath121 and the time exponent @xmath123 leads to @xmath124 , in agreement with our previous estimation for the anomalous time exponent .    in order to try to explain this puzzeling situation we have considered the effect of the characteristic size of the pinned regions on the interface local scaling . besides the super - rough character of interfaces generated by the qew equation and the corresponding anomalous scaling of the local width just discussed above",
    ", there is also another important effect that conspires to complicate even more the qew problem .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the quenched disorder in eq.([qew ] ) can slow down the motion of the interface in large regions of length @xmath125 in which the interface temporarily remains pinned . in an infinite system , the size of the pinned regions , @xmath16 , diverges as @xmath126 when approaching the depinning threshold @xmath12 from above and the exponent @xmath127 @xcite ( or @xmath128 in ref.@xcite ) can be measured in simulation from a direct observation of these pinned regions in the interface . for a system of finite size @xmath25",
    "the depinning transition occurs at a value of the driving force @xmath129 for which @xmath130 . as a consequence , in a finite system the depinning force @xmath131 depends on the system size , and close to the depinning transition both lengths @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath25 become relevant in the dynamics .",
    "thus , in any proper numerical determination of the global roughness exponent at the depinning threshold one must have in mind two important facts . first , to obtain the global exponent @xmath132 ( where @xmath133 ) one has to perform simulations in systems with different sizes @xmath25 and , after saturation for @xmath134 , one can fit the power law @xmath135 . secondly , since the critical force @xmath136 is different for a different size of the system , in order to keep the system at the depinning transition one must vary the driving force @xmath11 in such a way that @xmath137 .",
    "these requirements lead to a dependence of the saturated global width on the relevant lengths @xmath16 and @xmath25 at the depinning transition as @xmath138 where @xmath139 is an exponent that characterizes the dependence of the global width on the correlation length @xmath16 .",
    "it is worth remarking here that only when @xmath137 the system is certainly being maintained at the depinning transition and the exponent @xmath132 can be measured . on the contrary",
    ", numerical simulations done in systems with different sizes , but in which the driving force @xmath11 is not adjusted to the corresponding @xmath136 , always yield a different roughness exponent @xmath140 .",
    "the exponent @xmath22 would appear for any @xmath11 somewhat larger than @xmath141 and gives the global roughness in the _ moving _ phase .    in ref.@xcite an anomalous dependence of the prefactor of the width on the driving force as @xmath142",
    "was already found , with @xmath143 .",
    "we believe that the dependence of the saturated width on the driving force close to the depinning transition indicates that the system is not just at the transition .",
    "taking into account the measured values @xmath127 @xcite and @xmath143 @xcite we have @xmath144 .",
    "so , we obtain a global roughness exponent @xmath145 in agreement with our numerical determination ( @xmath4 , see fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 ) as well as with previous simulations @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have found that the complete scaling behaviour of the qew equation is not trivial . at the depinning transition",
    "the interface is super - rough and this leads to the violation of the usual scaling ansatz .",
    "in particular , the local width exhibits a new time regime with an exponent @xmath146 .",
    "we have shown that this is associated with the existence of two different roughness exponents describing the scaling of the local and global fluctuations .",
    "a new dynamic scaling , which was already used in other growth processes , has been successfully applied to understand the scaling behaviour of the local width .    accordingly to this scaling , eq.([anomal - scal ] ) , the measured value of the local roughness , close to unity @xmath97 , suggests that the anomalous scaling of the local width is due to super - roughening , in such a way that a global roughness exponent larger than one must exist .",
    "a direct determination of the time exponent gives @xmath147 in agreement with most of the previous works . on the contrary , a direct determination of the global roughness exponent from the scaling of the saturated global width with the system size can be controversial since variation of the total size @xmath25 leads to a change in the depinning threshold @xmath12 .",
    "the effect of the characteristic length of the pinned sites regions is relevant close to the depinning transition .",
    "it seems then that it is possible to obtain two different values for the global roughness exponent depending on the procedure used .",
    "the most usual reported value of the global roughness exponent @xmath4 ( and @xmath114 ) is obtained by us from collapses of the local width as well as from the behaviour of the structure factor . however , a direct measure of the correlation lenght reflects that there is a dynamic exponent @xmath121 @xcite ( and consequently @xmath122 ) .",
    "moreover , it remains unclear for us which of the mentioned methods ( and the corresponding set of critical exponents ) is the proper to describe completely the scaling behaviour of the interface at depinning .",
    "we believe that it is a very unsatisfactory situation the fact that , on the one hand , the depinning threshold changes with the system size and , on the other hand , one of the exponents of interest , the global roughness exponent , has to be measured by changing the system size .",
    "it seems difficult to define a correct roughness exponent at critical depinning as the exponent @xmath22 in the power law @xmath148 while a variation of @xmath25 yields a shift in the critical point .    from an experimental point of view",
    "the local roughness exponent is very important since it is the exponent accessible in experiments , in which the size of the sample remains fixed .",
    "we suggest that the anomalous scaling ( [ anomal - scal ] ) might be useful for clarifying whether the qew equation certainly describes the motion of interfaces in disordered media , since in many experiments it may be possible to study the time evolution of the local width and to determine the existence of an anomalous exponent @xmath86 .",
