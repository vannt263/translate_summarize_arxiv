    "measurements of deep inelastic lepton  nucleon scattering have long been a way of probing the dynamics of the strong force , yielding a detailed picture of the structure of the proton and precise extractions of the strong coupling constant .",
    "this is important in trying to understand the structure of matter at its most basic level , but also has direct application to other projects where nucleons are or will be used such as the lhc .",
    "data from hera provides the backbone of our understanding of the structure of the proton with numerous measurements performed to high precision and covering a wide kinematic range .",
    "all data from the h1 and zeus collaborations on measurements of inclusive deep inelastic scattering have recently been combined  @xcite .",
    "these data will provide the basis for understanding the structure of the proton for many years to come .",
    "the data provide many beautiful demonstrations of fundamental physical phenomena such as scaling violations of the cross section and electroweak unification .",
    "the high precision also allows their sole use in a qcd fit to determine the parton distribution functions in the proton ( called herapdf2.0 ) .",
    "the data , taken over the 15-year lifetime of the hera accelerator , correspond to a total luminosity of about 1fb@xmath1 of deep inelastic electron  proton and positron  proton scattering .",
    "all data used were taken with an electron beam energy of 27.5gev .",
    "roughly equal amounts of data for electron  proton and positron  proton scattering were recorded .",
    "the bulk of the data were taken with a proton beam energy of 920gev , but samples with proton beam energies of 820 , 575 and 460gev were also collected .",
    "the data were combined separately for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 data and the different centre - of - mass energies .",
    "overall , 41 separate data sets were used in the combination , spanning the ranges @xmath6gev@xmath7 and @xmath8 , i.e.  six orders of magnitude in each variable .",
    "the initial measurements consisted of in total 2937 published cross sections which were combined to 1307 final combined cross - section measurements .",
    "the data combination procedure involved a careful treatment of the various uncertainties between all the sets of data .",
    "in particular the correlations of the various sources were assessed and those uncertainties deemed to be point - to - point correlated were accounted for as such in the averaging of the data based on a @xmath9 minimisation method .",
    "the resulting @xmath9 is 1687 for 1620 degrees of freedom , demonstrating excellent compatibility of the multitude of data sets .",
    "the power of the data combination can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : data - comb ] which displays a selection of the data in bins of the photon virtuality , @xmath2 , and for fixed values of bjorken @xmath10 .",
    "the individual data sets from several different publications are shown here separately .",
    "a combined data point can be the combination of up to 8 individual measurements and the improvement in precision is striking .",
    "an indication of the precision of the combined data is that the total uncertainties are close to 1% for the bulk region of @xmath11gev@xmath7 .    , versus @xmath2 for h1 and zeus data sets ( open points ) and after the hera combination ( solid points ) .",
    "a selection of data for fixed @xmath10 is shown.,width=396 ]",
    "the data in fig .  [ fig : data - comb ] also demonstrate beautifully the effect of scaling violations in deep inelastic scattering . at @xmath12 ,",
    "the cross section is flat with @xmath2 , whereas the cross section falls with increasing @xmath2 at high @xmath10 and rises rapidly with increasing @xmath2 at low @xmath10 .",
    "this rapid rise is indicative of an ever - increasing gluon density being probed , shown here for a subset of the data sample .",
    "the differential cross sections at high @xmath2 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ew - uni ] for neutral and charged current events for both @xmath4 and @xmath5 interactions . at @xmath13gev@xmath7 , the neutral current cross",
    "section is significantly higher than the charged current cross section due to the dominance of photon exchange . at @xmath14gev@xmath7 ,",
    "the cross sections become similar , due to the exchange of massive vector bosons , indicative of the unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces .",
    "the difference in the neutral current cross sections for @xmath4 and @xmath5 data is due to @xmath15 interference effects ; this allowed an extraction of the @xmath16 structure function which is related to the density of valence quarks ( not shown ) .",
    "the helicity structure of the @xmath17 exchange and the different quarks being probed also leads to the observed difference in @xmath4 and @xmath5 data in charged current interactions .     compared to standard model predictions ( solid curves).,width=396 ]",
    "the data demonstrating these fundamental physical properties are well described by the standard model , encompassed on the qcd fit , herapdf2.0 , described in the next section .",
    "the hera data was then used as the sole input to a qcd analysis using the dglap equations at leading ( lo ) , next - to - leading ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) .",
    "the data were restricted to @xmath18gev@xmath7 , with the minimum @xmath2 value varied and the effects studied as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_vs_q2 ] . as can be seen in the figure , the overall @xmath9/d.o.f . for the full @xmath2 range is about 1.2 ( at both nlo and nnlo ) , but becomes lower until about 10gev@xmath7 where is levels out at a value of about 1.14 . the same trend with @xmath2 , but just with different absolute values was present in the hera i data ( 19922000 )  @xcite .",
    "this trend towards lower @xmath2 indicates that something more is needed beyond dglap evolution and a full and consistent description of these data will lead to a deeper understanding of qcd .",
    "however , it should be noted that predictions for lhc processes do not differ between the fits with @xmath19 of 3.5gev@xmath7 or 10gev@xmath7 .",
    "/d.o.f . of qcd",
    "fit to hera data for differing minimum values of @xmath2 .",
    "results are shown at different orders for the calculation and also for the fit to hera i data only .",
    "the rtopt  @xcite label signifies the scheme used to treat heavy quarks.,width=396 ]        jet and charm data were also included in an nlo qcd fit allowing an extraction of the strong coupling constant .",
    "the qcd fit described the data well and yielded a value of the strong coupling constant consistent with the world average and with an experimental precision of better than 1% .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty due to varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales was significantly larger , about 3% , and could hopefully be improved with a nnlo jet calculation and so allowing a nnlo fit of the data ."
