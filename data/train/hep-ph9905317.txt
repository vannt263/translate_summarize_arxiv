    "in this paper , we study the electric dipole moments of nucleons ( nedm , denoted as @xmath0 ) , which serves as an indicator of both parity ( p ) and time reversal ( t ) symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the main focus is on the possible violations of p and t ( or cp ) symmetries in the strong interactions , with quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as the underlying theory . in this picture , the nucleons ( n ) are treated as composite particles consisting of quarks (  q ) and gluons ( g ) and the strong p and t violating interaction in the qcd lagrangian is characterized by a @xmath3 parameter @xcite ( see sec.[sec : y2 ] for a definition of this parameter ) .",
    "such a p and t violating interaction among quarks and gluons generates a coupling of the nucleon spin to the external electric field , and the strength of this coupling is defined as the electric dipole moment of the nucleon .",
    "our purpose is to establish a functional dependence of the nedm on the @xmath3 parameter , along with other fundamental parameters of the qcd lagrangian , e.g. , the quark masses @xmath7 , and the values of quark condensates @xmath8 .",
    "based on the current experimental upper bound of the neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm , denoted as @xmath9 ) , which is less than @xmath10 @xcite , we can obtain an upper bound on the strong cp violating parameter @xmath3 .",
    "previous calculations , based on effective models of qcd , require @xmath11 @xcite . the puzzle of explaining such an unnaturally small number is referred to as the strong cp problem @xcite .",
    "the problem is difficult and interesting , since an analytical calculation of low energy hadronic observables based on the qcd lagrangian is not a trivial task .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that an important property of qcd , namely  chiral symmetry , is closely related to the strong cp problem and imposes three stringent constraints on the possible breaking of p and t symmetries in qcd , which include : ( 1 ) the necessity of non  zero quark masses @xcite , ( 2 ) spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , and ( 3 ) the @xmath4 anomaly @xcite @xcite .",
    "these symmetry constraints not only dictate the functional dependence of all cp violating observables on the qcd parameters , but also provide a dynamical suppression to the cp violating observables @xcite .    a natural solution of the strong cp problem can be obtained without invoking a tiny @xmath3 parameter if the dynamical suppression is sufficient to diminish the cp violating observables below the experimental upper bound .",
    "thus , we need to face the challenge how to realize these constraints explicitly in our calculations without employing a perturbative expansion on the @xmath3 parameter . our calculations on the nedm problem , which is the first one based on the quark",
    " gluon degrees of freedom and the qcd lagrangian with a @xmath3 parameter , will provide a critical answer to such an interesting scenario for the strong cp problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : an introduction to the nedm problem and the strong cp violation is given in section [ sec : y2 ] , where we also set up the notations used in this work .",
    "the hadronic and quark  gluon representations of the nucleon correlation functions ( ncf ) are discussed in section [ sec : y3 ] and section [ sec : y4 ] , respectively .",
    "the results obtained from both representations of the ncf are used to derive qcd sum rules , which are analyzed in section [ sec : y5 ] and section [ sec : y6 ] .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary in section [ sec : y7 ] .",
    "before we discuss the qcd sum rule calculations of the nucleon electric dipole moments @xcite , it is useful to clarify some issues related to the strong cp violation in qcd .    1 .",

    "our notation is chosen such that the corresponding cp violating parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are angular variables . ] and the qcd generating functional is periodic with respect to these cp violating parameters .",
    "the general qcd lagrangians with two chiral phases @xmath15 , @xmath16 are not all physically independent . through the @xmath4 anomaly",
    "@xcite @xcite , we can shift some part of @xmath15 to @xmath16 , and vice versa , by performing an @xmath4 rotation on the quark field @xmath17 therefore , only the difference between these two phases , @xmath18 which is invariant under an @xmath4 rotation , is a physical parameter and can be used to label the equivalent classes of cp violating qcd lagrangians @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since physical observables should be independent of the reparameterization of the lagrangian , we conclude that a cp violating observable should only be proportional to @xmath3 , instead of being an arbitrary function of @xmath15 and/or @xmath16 .",
    "+ in addition to the explicit symmetry - breaking parameter @xmath3 , there are three important symmetry constraints which could suppress the magnitude of a cp violating observable .",
    "these constraints include : ( 1 ) explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to finite current quark masses , ( 2 ) spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking with a nonzero quark condensate , and ( 3 ) the @xmath4 anomaly @xcite .",
    "suppression of the cp violating observables through the symmetry constraints is possible because in any of these particular limits , the effects of strong cp violation vanish , even with a nonzero @xmath3 parameter .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have a calculation of a cp violating observable , e.g. , @xmath0 , without assuming a perturbative expansion in the @xmath3 parameter .",

    "we shall extract various nucleon variables , e.g. , the nucleon masses @xmath61 , nucleon residues @xmath66 and their em moments @xmath108 , from the qsrs in a more rigorous manner .",
    "the emphasis here is to use the qcd sum rule method to obtain quantitive results for the hadronic variables , including an analysis and/or estimate of the errors and uncertainties in our calculations .",
    "we first discuss how to choose a region for the matching between two representations of the ncfs ; then we extract the hadronic observables from a least square fit .",
    "the possible errors and uncertainty are discussed in the third part and we summarize the results obtained from the sum rule analysis in the last part .    1",
    ".   * choice of the borel window * + as we have emphasized before , the hadronic and quark - gluon representations of the ncfs are based on two different expansion schemes and there is no a priori reason that , under our truncation and approximation , these two expansions should provide the same information of the ncfs . while it is possible to enlarge the overlap and improve the convergence with the use of the borel transform , a matching region between both sides of the sum rules has to be specified . in view of the different convergence properties , we use the following criterion to define the borel window . + first of all , on the quark gluon representation of the ncfs , we require that the highest dimension condensates contribute to the whole series less than @xmath280 .",
    "this leads to a lower bound on the borel mass squared @xmath281 .",
    "+ secondly , for the hadronic parametrization , we restrict the contribution from the continuum to be no greater than @xmath280 of the leading ope contributions to the ncf .",
    "this leads to an upper bound on the borel mass squared @xmath282 .",
    "+ thirdly , the extractions to represent the uncertainity with our extractions . ] of the hadronic variables in the region specified above",
    "introduce additional uncertainity .",
    "presumably , the third uncertainity is not independent from the ones associated with the convergence requirement .",
    "however , such a correlation is not transparent in our analysis , and we simply take the intersection region of the three criterions to define the borel window , which lies between @xmath283 to @xmath284 .",
    "* extraction of the hadronic observables from the qcd sum rules * + given the simplifications discussed in the previous section , we obtain several relations which give the hadronic observables as functions of the squared borel mass .",
    "as we have emphasized , if the matching between the hadronic and quark  gluon representations of the ncf is realized in the given borel window , all the hadronic observables should have only a mild dependence on the squared borel mass .",
    "therefore , we plot parameter to be @xmath285 . ] all six chirally invariant hadronic observables , nucleon mass @xmath61 , nucleon residue @xmath286 , proton and neutron magnetic moments @xmath287 and electric dipole moments @xmath288 , as functions of the squared borel mass @xmath189 in fig.5 and fig.6 .",
    "the final values of these hadronic observables are determined by averaging the functions over the borel window and the uncertainty is given by the @xmath289 of this average . since it is necessary to have such @xmath289 uncertainty to be smaller than the uncertainty associated with the choice of borel window , we shall consider the result obtained from our sum rule analysis to lie within @xmath280 uncertainty .",
    "* error analysis * + we list a few comments on the errors and uncertainties related to this calculation .",
    "+ on the ope calculations of the ncf : + \\(1 ) the convergence of the ope expansion : + the ope series for the ncf in momentum space is a @xmath110 expansion , where we assume that all vacuum condensates are proportional to @xmath290 to a certain power , with a numerical coefficient of order @xmath291 .",
    "while there is no systematic way to estimate the large order behavior of the coefficients and test this assumption , the expansion series could be an asymptotic series and has no convergence radius at all .",
    "we have to content ourselves with the naive estimate from the borel window analysis and estimate the contributions from the higher dimensional condensates to be below @xmath280 .",
    "+ \\(2 ) approximations in the calculations of the wilson coefficients : + when we calculate the ope series of a correlation function , the wilson coefficients are expanded in the powers of `` small '' parameters , @xmath292 , @xmath293 and we make truncations of the series to obtain an approximate results for the wilson coefficients .",
    "again , the higher order behavior of the perturbative expansion is poorly known and we make no attempt to study the higher order contributions in the present work .",
    "+ \\(3 ) hadronic parameterizations : + this is the most challenging part in the sum rule analysis , because we have no ad hoc criterion to see how well our ansatz , e.g. , the momentum independence of the excited state parameters @xmath294 , works .",
    "there are some analyses which show that this part could bring in a large uncertainty to a sum rule calculation @xcite .",
    "+ \\(4 ) the extraction of physical quantities from the matching : + since physical quantities should be independent of the borel mass , the deviation of the physical observables from a constant value in a given borel window should not be larger than the uncertainty associated with the choice of a borel window .",
    "nevertheless , the scheme dependent errors ( how do we extract physical quantities from the matching ) are related to the @xmath289 of the matching , and represent the quality of a sum rule calculation .",
    "+ \\(5 ) the dependence on the input parameters : + the qcd sum rule calculations generally rely on input parameters which are derived from other sources , e.g. , the quark mass , quark condensates etc .. in many cases , these numbers are not well determined and their variations from a `` standard '' value have to be taken into account when we estimate the errors of the physical quantities from a qcd sum rule calculation .",
    "recently , an analysis was performed by d.b .",
    "leinweber @xcite and we shall not dwell on this aspect further in this work .",
    "* summary of the results * + in summary , we obtain the following results for the hadronic observables from the sum rule analysis : @xmath295",
    "the electric dipole moments of nucleons ( nedm , @xmath0 ) are calculated using the method of qcd sum rules . through the use of a polar representation of both nucleon em moments ( anomalous magnetic moment @xmath31 and electric dipole moment @xmath33 ) and the @xmath4 covariant quark condensates , we are able to demonstrate the reparameterization invariance of cp violating observables explicitly in a qcd lagrangian with a cp violating @xmath3 parameter . the symmetry constraints on strong cp violation in qcd ,",
    "together with a dual relationship between the quark mass @xmath7 and the chiral radius @xmath8 @xcite are realized in the qcd sum rule relations which connect the hadronic observables to the qcd parameters .",
    "the extraction of the nedm in terms of the @xmath3 parameter and qcd parameters from the qcd sum rule relations can be achieved without assuming a perturbative expansion of the @xmath3 parameter .",
    "in addition , the periodic dependence of the cp violating observables on the @xmath3 parameter comes out naturally in our approach .",
    "our final result establishes a functional dependence of the nedm on the @xmath3 parameter , which , combined with the experimental upper bound on the nedm , gives an upper bound on the unknown @xmath3 parameter of less than @xmath296 .",
    "while this result is compatible with previous calculations of the nedm using different techniques , it also indicates that a dynamical suppression of the cp violating observables , as implied by the symmetry constraints on the strong cp violation in qcd , is not sufficient to resolve the strong cp problem .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a solution to the strong cp problem does not exist within qcd and a natural explanation of the tiny @xmath3 parameter necessarily requires physics beyond the standard model .",
