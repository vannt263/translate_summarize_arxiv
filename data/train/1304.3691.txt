    "a rooted evolutionary tree is a directed weighted tree graph ; it represents the evolutionary relationship between groups ( also called taxa ) of organisms ( figure 1(a ) ) . a leaf or a tip is a node with degree 1 ; each tip represents a modern day taxon .",
    "the root ( node 0 ) represents the most recent common ancestor ( mrca ) of all the taxa . the direction ( of evolution )",
    "is from the root to the tips .",
    "evolutionary tree as a vector of parameters influences the probability distribution of alleles at the tips .",
    "a rooted population tree is a rooted evolutionary tree where the taxa are populations from the same species .",
    "two types of parameters are common in any model of the rooted population tree : the tree - topology parameter ( a categorical parameter ) for the whole tree , and a branch parameter for each branch ( also called edge ) .",
    "the tree - topology is the order in which the path from the root separates for the given set of populations ; it is represented as a directed tree graph without the weight .",
    "( in figure 1(a ) and ( b ) , the two trees have different tree - topologies for the populations 1 - 4 . )",
    "a branch parameter is usually a branch - length ( an edge - weight ) or a transition probability matrix that influences the change in allele frequency between the two nodes of a branch .    here",
    "we will prove the identifiability of a population tree model by @xcite that uses kingman s coalescent process ( @xcite ) .",
    "the model was later modified and expanded by various authors ( @xcite ) .",
    "coalescent - based models are of significant importance as they model the underlying allele frequency changes with accuracy and relative ease ( see @xcite ) .    due to the underlying structure in evolutionary tree - based models ,",
    "its identifiability is never obvious .",
    "the identifiability of certain evolutionary tree models have been a recent topic of discussion .",
    "@xcite proved the identifiability of a general time reversible ( gtr ) transition probability matrix - based model .",
    "non - identifiability of another time reversible model was established in @xcite .",
    "the non - identifiability of mixture models have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the identifiability for the @xcite model has been proven by @xcite . to our knowledge",
    "the identifiability of the coalescent - based model of @xcite has never been proven .    for estimating evolutionary trees each independent genetic locus",
    "is viewed as a single data - point , as opposed to viewing each individual as a data - point ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "thus , identifiability would mean that the model parameters can be identified from the distribution of allele - types for a set of individuals at a single genetic locus .",
    "in this section we will describe the underlying model of @xcite .",
    "we start by defining our notations ( see also figure 1(c ) ) .",
    "we define a @xmath0-tip population tree as @xmath1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 is the tree - topology , an unweighted directed tree - graph ; it takes finitely many discrete categorical values ; the @xmath3 in superscript denotes the number of tips .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is a vector of length @xmath5 consisting of the branch - lengths @xmath6 for each branch @xmath7 in @xmath2 .",
    "a strictly bifurcating tree - topology has exactly @xmath5 branches .",
    "if @xmath2 is non - bifurcating then it has less branches and the remaining elements of @xmath8 are populated by zeros .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is a vector containing the parameters of root distribution which we will define later in this section .",
    "we also define @xmath10 as the set of tips at @xmath2 .    at each tip",
    "@xmath11 there are @xmath12 lineages , each having allele - type ` 0 ' or ` 1 ' .",
    "the allele types among these lineages at each tip are the observable random variables .",
    "similarly , at each non - tip node @xmath13 , the random variable @xmath14 is the ( random ) number of lineages that are ancestral to the tips below @xmath13 along the tree .",
    "we also define the random variable @xmath15 at each node @xmath13 ( tip or non - tip ) , as the count of allele ` 1 ' among the @xmath16 lineages . from now on we will use the term ` allele - count ' to refer to the count of allele ` 1 ' . for each tip @xmath11",
    ", the allele - count @xmath17 is observable .",
    "consider a branch with lower ( towards the tips ) node @xmath13 and upper ( towards the root ) node @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be the number of lineages in @xmath18 that are ancestral to the @xmath16 lineages at @xmath13 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "also , let @xmath21 be the allele - count among these @xmath19 lineages ( @xmath22 ) . if @xmath18 is the upper node of @xmath23 branches with lower nodes @xmath24 , then @xmath25 and also @xmath26 .",
    "( for a strictly bifurcating tree @xmath27 . )    from the model parameters @xmath1 one computes the probability of observed vector of allele - counts @xmath28 from samples of sizes @xmath29 at @xmath0 tips ( @xmath30 ) as follows .",
    "consider a branch with length @xmath31 , with upper node @xmath18 and lower node @xmath32 .",
    "given the probability mass function ( pmf ) of @xmath33 ( the number of lineages at @xmath32 ) , the pmf of @xmath34 is computed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 . then , the pmf of @xmath37 is determined from eq .",

    "( [ eq : tn85 ] ) and ( [ eq : nsum ] ) , starting from @xmath29 and going upward , one computes the pmf of @xmath38 and @xmath39 for any non - tip non - root node @xmath11 , and finally @xmath40 at the root ( node 0 ) .",
    "then a ` root distribution ' with parameter @xmath9 gives the pmf of ( allele - count ) @xmath41 given @xmath40 at the root : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the maximum possible value of @xmath40 ( number of lineages at the root ) .",
    "different authors have used different root distributions . in particular",
    "@xcite used symmetric beta - binomial distribution : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the beta function ; @xmath46 is a parameter to be estimated .",
    "then , from the distribution of @xmath47 and @xmath48 for all non - root nodes @xmath11 , we compute the distribution of @xmath17 ( allele - counts ) at the rest of the nodes as follows . consider a node @xmath18 where @xmath23 branches merge from the bottom with the bottom nodes @xmath49 . recall that we already have the distributions of @xmath37 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the pmf of @xmath53 is computed from the pmf of @xmath54 using the formula @xmath55 then the pmf of @xmath56 is computed from the above pmf using the following ( from an expression in @xcite ) : @xmath57 @xmath58 ( @xcite ) .",

    "let @xmath1 be a tree with @xmath63 .",
    "we define a subtree @xmath64 of @xmath65 as a tree formed by a subset @xmath66 ( cardinality @xmath67 ) of @xmath10 by tracking the tips in @xmath66 along the tree to their most recent common ancestor ( mrca ) node .",

    "we assign the two - tip subtrees into two categories : type - i subtrees are those with the root as the mrca of the two tips .",
    "for example in figure 1(a ) , the subtree formed by tips @xmath92 has the root as the mrca of the two tips 3 and 4 .",
    "thus , it is of type - i .",
    "all other two - tip subtrees are type - ii subtrees . for example , in figure 1(a ) , if a subtree is formed by tips 2 and 4 , it will be a type - ii subtree as their mrca is node 6 , and not the root",
