    "substantial progress achieved during the past decade in studies of active galactic nuclei has brought an increasingly wider recognition of the ubiquity of relativistic outflows ( jets ) in galactic nuclei , turning them into an effective probe of nuclear regions in galaxies @xcite .",
    "emission properties , dynamics , and evolution of an extragalactic jet are intimately connected to the characteristics of the supermassive black hole , accretion disk and broad - line region in the nucleus of the host galaxy .",
    "high - resolution radio observations access directly the regions where the jets are formed @xcite , and trace their evolution and interaction with the nuclear environment ( mundell et al .",
    "these studies , combined with optical and x - ray studies , yield arguably the most detailed picture of the galactic nuclei @xcite . presented below is a brief summary of recent results in this field , outlining the relation between jets , supermassive black holes and nuclear regions in prominent active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in this respect , this review is complementary to other recent reviews @xcite focused on formation and propagation of extragalactic relativistic jets .",
    "jets in active galaxies are formed in the immediate vicinity of the central black hole @xcite , and they interact with every major constituent of agn ( see table  [ lobanov : tb1 ] .",
    "the jets carry away a fraction of the angular momentum and energy stored in the accretion flow @xcite or corona ( in low luminosity agn ; merloni & fabian 2002 ) and in the rotation of the central black hole @xcite .    [",

    "the production of highly - relativistic outflows requires a large fraction of the energy to be converted to poynting flux in the very central region @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of this process may depend on the spin of the central black hole @xcite .",
    "the collimation of such a jet requires either a large scale poloidal magnetic field threading the disk @xcite or a slower and more massive mhd outflow launched at larger disk radii by centrifugal forces ( bogovalov & tsinganos 2005 ) .    at distances of @xmath7",
    "( @xmath8 is the gravitational radius of a black hole ) , the jets become visible in the radio regime , which makes high - resolution vlbi observations a tool of choice for probing directly the physical conditions in agn on such small scales .",
    "recent studies indicate that at distances of @xmath9@xmath10 ( @xmath11pc ) the jets are likely to be dominated by pure electromagnetic processes such as poynting flux @xcite or have both mhd and electrodynamic components @xcite .",
    "the flowing plasma is likely to be dominated by electron - positron pairs @xcite although a dynamically significant proton component can not be completely ruled out at the moment @xcite .",
    "how far the magnetic field dominated region extends in extragalactic jets is still a matter of debate .",
    "there are indications that this region does not extend beyond several parsecs .",
    "parsec - scale flows show clear evidence for the presence of rapidly dissipating relativistic shocks ( e.g. lobanov & zensus 1999 ) preceeding the development of kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite dominating the flow dynamics on kiloparsec scales @xcite .",
    "_ ultracompact _ jets observed down to sub - parsec scales typically show strongly variable but weakly polarized emission ( possibly due to limited resolution of the observations ) .",
    "compelling evidence exists for acceleration @xcite and collimation @xcite of the flows on these scales , which is most likely driven by the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the ultracompact outflows are probably dominated by electromagnetic processes @xcite , and they become visible in the radio regime ( identified as compact `` cores '' of jets ) at the point where the jet becomes optically thin for radio emission @xcite . at this point , the jets do not appear to have strong shocks @xcite and their basic properties are successfully described by quasi - stationary flows @xcite .",
    "the evolution and variability of the `` core '' can be explained by smooth changes in particle density of the flowing plasma , associated with the nuclear flares in the central engine ( fig .",
    "[ lobanov : fg01 ] .",
    "intrinsic brightness temperatures of the ultracompact jets are estimated to be ( 1@xmath12k @xcite , implying that the energy losses are dominated by the inverse - compton process .",
    "quasi - periodic variability of the radio emission from the ultracompact jets is most likely related to instabilities and non - stationary processes in the accretion disks around central black holes in agn ( igumenschev & abramovicz 1999 ; lobanov & roland 2005 ) .",
    "alternative explanations involve binary black hole systems in which flares are caused by passages of the secondary through the accretion disk around the primary @xcite .",
    "these models however require very tight binary systems , with orbits of the secondary lying well within @xmath9 schwarzschild radii of the primary ( between 20 and 100 schwarzschild radii , in the celebrated case of oj287 ; lehto & valtonen 1996 ) , which poses inevitable problems for maintaining an accretion disk around the primary ( for massive secondaries ; lobanov 2006 ) or rapid alignment of the secondary with the plane of the accretion disk ( for small secondaries ; ivanov et al .",
    "discrepancy between the predicted and actual epoch of the latest outburst in oj287 @xcite indicates further that the observed behavior is not easy to be reproduced by a binary black hole scenario and it is indeed more likely to result from a quasi - periodic process in the disk , similarly to the flaring activity observed in 3c345 @xcite .     in 3c309.1 at different frequencies @xcite .",
    "solid line shows changes of @xmath13 due to pressure gradients in the blr clouds supported by thermal pressure and maintaining a mass distribution with spherically symmetrical gravitational potential .",
    "the cloud region extends up to 400@xmath14 ( @xmath14 refers to the distance at which the jet becomes supersonic ) .",
    "the equipartition regime is approached at the outer boundary of the cloud region , with @xmath15 .",
    "significant deviations from the equipartition are seen on smaller scales , resulting in stronger self - absorption in the inner parts of the jet .",

    "a number of recent studies have used the ultracompact jets as probes of physical conditions in the central regions of agn .",
    "these studies have focused on basic characteristics of relativistic flows and atomic , physical properties of the molecular material in circumnuclear regions of agn , and connection between relativistic outflows and accretion disks and broad - line emitting regions .",
    "synchrotron self - absorption and external absorption in the ultracompact jets ( vlbi `` cores '' ) can be used effectively for determining the properties of the flow itself and its environment @xcite . absolute position of the core , @xmath16 , varies with the observing frequency , @xmath17 , so that @xmath18 , @xcite . if the core is self - absorbed and in equipartition , the power index @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "changes of the core position measured between three or more frequencies can be used for determining the value of @xmath13 and estimating the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath20 , in the nuclear region and the offset , @xmath21 , of the observed core positions from the true base of the jet ( see fig .",
    "[ lobanov : fg02 ] ) .",
    "the combination of @xmath20 and @xmath21 gives an estimate for the mass of the central black hole @xmath22 .",
    "core shift measurements provide estimates of the total ( kinetic + magnetic field ) power , the synchrotron luminosity , and the maximum brightness temperature , @xmath23 in the jets can be made @xcite .",
    "the ratio of particle energy to magnetic field energy can also be estimated , from the derived @xmath23 .",
    "this enables testing the original knigl model @xcite and several of its later modifications ( e.g. , hutter & mufson 1986 ; bloom & marscher 1996 ) .",
    "the known distance from the nucleus to the jet origin will also enable constraining the self - similar jet model @xcite and the particle - cascade model @xcite .",
    "recent studies of free - free absorption in agn indicate the presence of dense , ionized circumnuclear material with @xmath24k distributed within a fraction of a parsec of the central nucleus @xcite .",
    "properties of the circumnuclear material can also be studied using the variability of the power index @xmath13 with frequency .",
    "this variability results from pressure and density gradients or absorption in the surrounding medium most likely associated with the broad - line region ( blr ) .",
    "changes of @xmath13 with frequency , if measured with required precision , can be used to estimate the size , particle density and temperature of the absorbing material surrounding the jets ( see figure  [ lobanov : fg03 ] ) .",
    "estimates of the black hole mass and size of the blr obtained from the core shift measurements can be compared with the respective estimates obtained from the reverberation mapping and applications of the @xmath25@xmath26 relation .",
    "opacity and absorption in the nuclear regions of agn have been probed effectively using the non - thermal continuum emission as a background source .",
    "absorption due to several atomic and molecular species ( most notably due to hi , co , oh , and hco@xmath27 ) has been detected in a number of extragalactic objects .",
    "oh absorption has been used to probe the conditions in warm neutral gas @xcite , and co and hi  absorption were used to study the molecular tori @xcite at a linear resolution often smaller than a parsec @xcite .",
    "these observations have revealed the presence of neutral gas in a molecular torus in ngc4151 and in a rotating outflow surrounding the relativistic jet in 1946@xmath28708 @xcite .",
    "connection between accretion disks and relativistic outflows @xcite has been explored , using correlations between variability of x - ray emission produced in the inner regions of accretion disks and ejections of relativistic plasma into the flow @xcite .",
    "the jets can also play a role in the generation of broad emission lines in agn ( fig .",
    "[ lobanov : fg04 ] ) .",
    "the beamed continuum emission from relativistic jet plasma can illuminate atomic material moving in a sub - relativistic outflow from the nucleus , producing broad line emission in a conically shaped region located at a significant distance above the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "magnetically confined outflows can also contain information about the dynamic evolution of the central engine , for instance that of a binary black hole system @xcite .",
    "this approach can be used for explaining , within a single framework , the observed optical variability and kinematics and flux density changes of superluminal features embedded in radio jets .",
    "extragalactic jets are an excellent laboratory for studying physics of relativistic outflows and probing conditions in the central regions of active galaxies .",
    "recent studies of extragalactic jets show that they are formed in the immediate vicinity of central black holes in galaxies and carry away a substantial fraction of the angular momentum and energy stored in the accretion flow and rotation of the black hole . the jets are most likely collimated and accelerated by electromagnetic fields .",
    "convincing observational evidence exists connecting ejections of material into the flow with instabilities in the inner accretion disks . in radio - loud objects ,",
    "continuum emission from the jets may also drive broad emission lines generated in sub - relativistic outflows surrounding the jets .",
    "magnetically confined outflows may preserve information about the dynamics state of the central region , allowing detailed investigations of jet precession and binary black hole evolution to be made .",
    "this makes studies of extragalactic jets a powerful tool for addressing the general questions of physics and evolution of nuclear activity in galaxies .",
