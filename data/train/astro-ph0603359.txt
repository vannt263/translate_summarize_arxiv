    "the torus geometry adopted to describe the shape and the spatial distribution of dust is the so - called _ flared disk _ , that is a sphere with the polar cones removed .",
    "its size is defined by its outer radius , r@xmath0 , and the opening angle , of the torus itself .",
    "the dust components that dominate both the absorption and the emission of radiation are graphite and silicate .",
    "the location of the inner radius , r@xmath1 , depends both on the sublimation temperature of the dust grains ( 1500 and 1000 k , for graphite and silicate , respectively ) and on the strength of the accretion luminosity .",
    "we adopted the absorption and scattering coefficients given by @xcite for dust grains of different dimensions , weighted with the standard mrn distribution @xcite .",
    "grains dimensions range from 0.005 to 0.25 micron for graphite , and 0.025 to 0.25 micron for silicate . the gas density within the torus",
    "is modeled in such a way to allow a gradient along both the radial and the angular coordinates .",
    "the central source is assumed to be point - like and its emission isotropic .",
    "its spectral energy distribution is defined by means of a composition of power laws with different values for the spectra index in the uv , optical and ir . a numerical approach ",
    "the @xmath2-iteration method  was adopted to solve the radiative transfer equation .",
    "a geometrical grid is defined along the three spatial coordinates , and the main physical quantities ( dust density and temperatures , electromagnetic emission , optical depth , etc . )",
    "are computed with respect to the center of the volume elements defined by the grid . when computing the total incoming energy on a given volume element a very accurate computation of the optical depth ,",
    "is done . furthermore , since silicate grains have a lower sublimation temperature with respect to graphite , we account for the fact that the innermost regions of the torus contain only graphite and are silicate free    finally , the global sed is computed at different angles of the line - of - sight with respect to the torus equatorial plane , in order to account for both type 1 and type 2 objects emission and includes three contributions : emission from the agn , thermal emission and scattering emission by dust in each volume element . for an example of an emitted spectrum see fig .",
    "[ figmod ] .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed description of the model developed to compute the emission of dust in agn .",
    "the mir data used here are taken from the swire elais n1 and n2 and the lockman fields , and were obtained from february 2004 through july 2004 , with both irac and mips . for the purposes of this work only the four irac bands and mips 24 micron are used .",
    "the swire catalogues we use were processed by the swire collaboration .",
    "details about the data can be found in @xcite , @xcite and shupe et al .",
    ", in prep .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey has validated and made publicly available its data release 4 ( dr4 ) , covering the entire lockman and swire en2 fields and a part of the swire en1 field . a total of 280 spectroscopically confirmed quasars lie within the swire fields covered by the sdss dr4 spectroscopic release .",
    "their @xmath3-band magnitudes reach 19.1 for objects with redshifts typically less than 2.3 and go up to a magnitude deeper for higher redshifts @xcite . for a detailed analysis of the properties of the sample in en1 see @xcite",
    "each observed sed is compared to a total of 720 models , with 10 lines of sight each ( from an equatorial to a pole - on view ) .",
    "examples of best fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ figex ] . here",
    "we summarize some of the results of the fitting procedure :    * _ size of torus : _ overall , r@xmath0/r@xmath1 and the torus covering factor are equally distributed between the allowed values ( 30 , 100 , and 300 ; 95% , 75% and 50% , respectively )",
    ". however , both inner and out radii clearly increase with @xmath4 , whereas larger covering factors models tend to fit realtively low redshift ( @xmath5 1 ) objects . * _ density : _ for @xmath670% of the objects the density ( written as @xmath7 ) decreases radially from the centre while for another @xmath625% it remains constant . * _ optical depth : _ this work addresses , among other things , the possibility of low optical depth tori .",
    "the sed fitting resulted in some @xmath645% of objects with @xmath8 1.0 and @xmath655% with @xmath9 1.0 .",
    "this implies that , for some configurations , type 1 agn could be seen even when the line of sight intercepts the torus .",
    "the distribution of outer radius of the torus , r@xmath0 , and the mass of dust , m@xmath10 , with @xmath4 is shown in the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ figrmz ] , respectively .",
    "m@xmath10 is computed summing the individual sample elements of the best - fit model .",
    "the increase of both r@xmath0 and m@xmath10 with redshift could indicate larger and more massive tori at higher redshifts , however it could also simply be the manifestation of the malmquist bias , as both quantities scale with the accretion luminosity , l@xmath11 , an input of our model that is proportional to the bolometric luminosity computed from the data .",
    "note that m@xmath10 does not refer to the total mass of the torus , that can be obtained by adding the mass of gas , typically @xmath6100 times larger than that of the dust .",
