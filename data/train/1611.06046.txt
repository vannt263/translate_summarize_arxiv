    "identification of any black hole candidate ( hereafter bhc ) involves in observing radiations from matter accreted on it .",
    "radiations give out information on spectral and temporal properties in x - rays , uv or optical band . in near future , with the advent of high - resolution imaging devices , imaging of such bhcs with matter all around will be possible .",
    "it is therefore essential to follow paths of photons emitted from hydrodynamically correct matter distribution with successful spectral features very accurately till they reach observer s image plane .",
    "this would enable us to obtain the spectra and images from different inclination angles . in this paper",
    ", we achieve this by taking a two component advective flow ( tcaf ) solution based on rigorous theory of transonic astrophysical flows ( chakrabarti , 1990 ) and computing emitted radiation by a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "bending of photons in a gravitational field is a natural consequence of general theory of relativity . in our context , photons emitted from the tcaf will be deviated by the strong gravitation field created by the black hole .",
    "deviations of photons depend on the space - time metric and its impact parameter . due to focusing effects , softer photons from the keplerian component",
    "may be forced to intercept hot electrons in the post - shock region of the low - angular momentum component located close to the horizon modifying the spectrum .",
    "theoretical work on imaging of emitting matter surrounding a black hole started in 1970s .",
    "the first step towards this emitter - to - observer ray tracing was attempted by cunningham & bardeen ( 1973 ) .",
    "isoradial curves were drawn for a rotating black hole at some specified inclination angle .",
    "pineault & roeder ( 1977 ) repeated this work with the variation of spin parameter .",
    "a complete image of a black hole surrounded by rotating matter was first drawn by luminet in 1979 .",
    "idealized disk particles with differential rotational velocity were kept on the equatorial plane to construct a keplerian disk .",
    "mass of the disk was considered to be negligible as compared to the mass of the black hole .",
    "emission of photon was assumed to be isotropic in nature .",
    "bolometric flux of the keplerian disk and red - shift of photons were included in the image .",
    "the basic process of generating an image was considered to be a boundary value problem , connecting a disk and an observer . in that way , the transfer function using elliptic integral is a time saver .",
    "fukue & yokoyama ( 1988 ) produced a color photograph of a multi - wavelength study of the disk .",
    "they also studied flux variation in an eclipsing binary .",
    "karas et al .",
    "( 1992 ) developed a catalogue of photon trajectories with variable inclination angle and spin .",
    "viergutz ( 1993 ) first attempted emitter - to - observer problem in the kerr metric by generalizing the transfer function with rotating geometry . until this work",
    ", images were drawn using semi - analytical methods , by computing a relation between the impact parameter ( @xmath1 ) , polar angle ( @xmath2 ) on observer plane and observer s polar angle ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "marck ( 1996 ) integrated each trajectory of photons to generate an image for the first time .",
    "we have followed this approach in this paper . however , instead of using first order differential equations , we traced the ray using three dimensional second order equations to draw the complete photon trajectory .",
    "this gives us the freedom to use analytically established as well as time dependent three dimensional disks emitting photons with all known phase - space coordinates ( initial position and momentum of photons ) as a starting configuration .    in twenty - first century , the use of x - ray polarimetry flourished rapidly . with that , bromley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) added polarization while drawing the disk image .",
    "armitage and reynolds ( 2003 ) performed magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) on keplerian disk and provided temporal variations of a keplerian disk .",
    "mller & frauendiener ( 2011 ) developed figures using the same transfer functions .",
    "` gyoto ' ( vincent et .",
    "al . 2011 ) is an open software available for imaging and trajectory calculations .",
    "more recently , ` ynogk ' ( yang & wang 2013 ) , another publicly available code for kerr space time was published .",
    "however , the present literature is mostly dominated by the images of a most ideal disk configuration , namely , a keplerian disk , which unfortunately does not describe all the spectral states accurately . more recently , younsi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) published images containing relativistic thick disks for different inclinations and spin parameter with variation of gas pressure to radiation pressure ratios .",
    "however , so far , study of disk configurations , such as tcaf ( chakrabarti 1990 ; chakrabarti & titarchuk , 1995 ; hereafter ct95 ) , in different spectral states have been missing .",
    "since a black hole is very compact , the resolving power of a telescope must be very high to capture images close to the horizon .",
    "so , imaging by the so - called event horizon telescope concentrates on nearby relatively massive black holes such as those present at the centre of our galaxy , namely , sgr a * ( johnson et al .",
    "however , so far , no major attempt has been made to study the difference in images when the bhc is in the soft state and in the hard state , i.e. , changes in the configuration of the disk itself .",
    "part of the reason is that the model builders of spectral properties were keeping a keplerian disk as the basis of all such spectral states and only the randomly placed compton clouds ( clouds of hot electrons ) would change its properties .",
    "the hot cloud is required for inverse compton scattering ( sunyaev & titarchuk , 1985 ) .",
    "a concrete understanding of where the compton cloud is really located and how its geometry vis - a'-vis the keplerian disk should change with spectral states came about only after successful application of the transonic flow solution in the context of black hole accretion by ct95 .",
    "this so - called two component advective flow ( tcaf ) solution is regularly applied to explain spectral evolutions of numerous outbursting bhcs ( see , debnath et al .",
    "2014 ; mondal et al . 2014 ; jana et al . 2015 ; molla et al . 2016",
    "; debjit et al .",
    "2016 ) and actual physical parameter such as the accretion rates in the two components , the compression ratio of the centrifugally supported shock structure and the size of the compton cloud itself were derived . according to ct95 ,",
    "state transitions are due to changes in accretion rates , only the time scale of such changes varies with the mass of the black hole .",
    "higher accretion rates in the keplerian component relative to the advective component cools the hot electrons in the compton cloud shrinking it to a small size resulting in a softer state . in the opposite case of higher advective flow rate , compton cloud ( post - shock region ) remains hotter and a hard state is produced with a truncated keplerian disk with its inner edge coinciding with the compton cloud boundary or the shock location .",
    "so , geometry of the flow drastically changes with the spectral state .",
    "this is not common in massive black holes but there are certainly active galaxies with both classes of spectra . in stellar mass black holes ,",
    "this change of geometry is common and quicker .",
    "for instance , in grs 1915 + 105 , there are more than dozens of variability classes and all these are physically distinguished by the system geometry governed by the size of the compton cloud and the truncated keplerian component ( pal & chakrabarti , 2011 , 2013 ) .",
    "one of the important results by an earlier numerical simulations by molteni et al .",
    "( 1994 ) is that the post - shock region ( otherwise called the centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer or cenbol , used as the compton cloud in tcaf of ct95 ) of a transonic flow has most of the characteristics of a thick accretion torus ( abramowicz et al . , 1978 and kozlowski et al . , 1978 ; paczyski & wiita , 1980 ; begelman",
    "blandford & rees , 1982 ; chakrabarti , 1985 , hereafter c85 ) , except that cenbol also has a radial motion and thus more accurate than the thick disk models of early eighties mentioned above . in an attempt to have a stationary image",
    "we require a theoretical solution for the cenbol .",
    "we therefore use the fully general relativistic thick torus solution of chakrabarti ( 1985 ) as the cenbol along with a truncated keplerian disk to have a theoretical model of a two component advective flow . to have different spectral states we change the accretion rates of these two components . to generate the spectrum from it ,",
    "we employ a monte - carlo simulation code where soft photons from the truncated keplerian component are allowed to ( inverse ) compton scatter from the relativistic maxwellian electrons inside the cenbol .",
    "monte - carlo process ( pozdnyakov et al",
    ". , 1983 ) provides one of the best techniques to generate the complete spectrum .",
    "the power - law component in the observed spectrum of black hole candidates is the result of repeated inverse comptonization ( sunyaev & titarchuk , 1985 ) of the soft photons .",
    "thus , combining thermal multi - colour black body photons from the keplerian disk , with the power - law component from thermal comptonization , one obtains a complete spectrum .",
    "the comptonized photons then follow curved trajectories as they leak out from the cenbol after possible repeated scatterings and reach the observer .",
    "higher energy x - rays are expected to come from deep inside of the cenbol after multiple scatterings .",
    "thus , one can obtain a different image with photons of different energy range .",
    "this makes the problem very interesting as far as observations are concerned . from the same simulation , by filtering photons reaching out to a series of observers sitting at different inclination angles",
    ", we also obtain totally different images and spectra of the same source with the same intrinsic disk properties . the time lag properties of this configuration would be important also .",
    "this would be reported elsewhere .",
    "the plan of our paper is the following . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss geometry of the cenbol and the keplerian disk in our simulation . in  3 , we describe the equations governing the null trajectories and image generation process that were used in this work . in  4 , we present results of monte - carlo simulations for different disk parameters and in  5 , we draw conclusions .",
    "in tcaf scenario , the higher viscosity component forms a keplerian disk while the lower viscosity and low angular momentum component ( which surrounds the keplerian flow ) forms a centrifugal barrier close to a black hole . in a large region of the parameter space ,",
    "the centrifugal barrier induces formation of a standing or an oscillatory shock .",
    "the post - shock region is the compton cloud . being subsonic and basically rotating with more or less constant angular momentum , cenbol satisfies some of the conditions of a radiation pressure supported thick accretion disk or a hot ion pressure supported torus ( abramowicz et al . , 1978 ; kozlowski et al . , 1978 ; paczyski & wiita , 1980 ; begelman , blandford & rees , 1982 ; chakrabarti , 1985 , hereafter c85 ) and therefore for all practical purposes",
    ", one can use c85 prescription of ` natural angular momentum ' in general to describe electron number density and temperature distribution inside a hot cenbol .",
    "cenbol remains a hot ion pressure supported torus when the keplerian component has a little accretion rate and the number of soft photon is not enough to cool down the cenbol .",
    "we follow the procedure given in c85 to obtain the temperature and density distribution inside the cenbol and treat it as the compton cloud . in tcaf ,",
    "the outer edge of the cenbol is also the inner edge of the keplerian component .",
    "soft photons from the keplerian disk is intercepted by the cenbol and are re - emitted after comptonization . in very soft states ,",
    "when the keplerian component rate is high , the cenbol collapses and the entire disk can be treated as the standard shakura - sunyaev ( 1973 , hereafter ss73 ) type disk which will pass through the inner sonic point due to its nature of transonicity ( chakrabarti , 1990 ) . with even higher accretion rates ,",
    "the inner edge is puffed up to produce a radiation pressure supported torus , but we will not explore that regime here . in fig . 1 , we present the geometry of our simulation . in order to obtain a stationary solution , we replace the high viscosity component of tcaf by the standard keplerian disk as suggested by page & thorne ( 1974 ) ( relativistic counterpart of ss73 ) and the advecting cenbol by a purely rotating thick ion torus ( c85 ) .",
    "typical schematic photon trajectories are shown .      to describe cenbol",
    ", we note that the relativistic euler s equation for the perfect fluid under the influence of gravity , centrifugal force and pressure gradient force can be written as ( c85 ) , @xmath4 where , @xmath5 is the pressure and @xmath6 is the total energy density . also , @xmath7 is specific angular momentum and @xmath8 is the relativistic angular momentum .",

    "we kept @xmath27 and @xmath28 to generate the innermost thick toroidal shell .",
    "variation of the potential keeping @xmath29 and @xmath30 fixed gives a large number of shells which create the complete stationary cenbol .",
    "comptonization occurs inside this region . since",
    ", electrons inside the disk generally have higher energy than the soft photons injected into it , the later are repeatedly inverse comptonized before they leave the cenbol and reach the observer in curved trajectories .      for comptonization",
    ", we need the information of density , pressure and temperature inside the cenbol region . for this , we choose a barotropic equation of state where iso - temperature and iso - density surfaces coincide with equipotential surfaces .",

    "4c has previously been presented in fukue & yokoyama ( 1988 ) using the semi - analytical transfer function .",
    "the null trajectory solution ( eqn .",
    "11 ) which we use , gives us the freedom to use three dimensional geometry and ability to gather information of physical quantities of that photon at any point in their path .",
    "the time of arrival of photons to an observer can be evaluated by this process .",
    "using monte carlo technique , we produce an image , more realistic than the earlier images using semi - analytical transfer function methods .",
    "now that we have demonstrated our ability to image a standard disk , we now carry out the monte - carlo simulation including comptonization and consider a tcaf configuration with a cenbol and a truncated keplerian disk as described in  2 .",
    "we keep our detectors at @xmath41 , just outside the tcaf system to get the simulated source spectrum , i.e. , the spectrum that is just coming out of the source . for the generation of the image ,",
    "the observer is placed at @xmath169 . in fig .",
    "5(a ) , the hardening of the output spectrum with the increase of the central temperature of the cenbol is shown . here , the disk rate ( @xmath170 ) is kept fixed at @xmath171 eddington rate . for spectral study",
    ", we define the energy spectral index @xmath2 to be @xmath172 .",
    "we note that @xmath2 decreases , i.e. , the spectrum hardens with the increase in the central temperature ( @xmath173 ) of cenbol . the spectrum of the injected soft photons for accretion rates of @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 are shown in fig .",
    "the corresponding emergent spectra keeping the central temperature fixed at 200kev is shown in fig .",
    "5c . in fig .",
    "5d , the direction dependent source spectrum is shown .",
    "photons are placed in four equal sized bins from 0 to 90 degrees ( @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 respectively . )",
    "the spectrum is clearly getting harder for higher inclination angles .",
    "variation of @xmath2 with @xmath173 and @xmath170 is presented also in table 1 .",
    "also , @xmath2 increases with increasing @xmath170 .",
    "the result is consistent with those of chakrabarti & titarchuk ( 1995 ) carried out in the pseudo - newtonian geometry .",
    "0.5 cm    .@xmath2 variation with @xmath173 & @xmath170 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the optical depth of the cenbol medium quantifies the number of scatterings that should occur . in fig .",
    "10 ( a - c ) , we have shown three cases where densities and temperatures of electron cloud were self consistently varied inorder to study cenbol with three different optical depths .",
    "the parameters employed are given in table 2 .",
    "in the lower density case , i.e. , in fig .",
    "10a , photons from keplerian disk have undergone very few scatterings in the cenbol region .",
    "the optical depth of the medium is so low that almost all the photons from the far side of the keplerian disk are visible by the observer .",
    "since the number of scattering is small , very less number of cenbol photons are visible from lower side of the keplerian disk also . fig .",
    "10b drawn for an intermediate optical depth , is same as the fig .",
    "some keplerian photons cross over the electron cloud without scattering , especially in regions of lower optical depth . in fig .",
    "10c , we consider a relatively higher central density so that the optical depth is everywhere larger than unity . here , almost all the photons which came from the other side of keplerian disk participate in scattering and thus the keplerian disk from far side becomes invisible .",
    "photons from the disk and the cenbol thus participate in the formation of the photon sphere .",
    "although the contribution of such photons is very less in the spectrum , the measurement of size and shape of the photon sphere can determine both the mass and spin of the black hole candidate in future .",
    "we will discuss this elsewhere .",
    "photons emerging from the vicinity a black hole encounter the strongest possible gravitational fields .",
    "so , spectral and temporal properties of a black hole should carry signatures of photon bending .",
    "spectra of black hole candidates are primarily generated from a keplerian disk ( black - body ) and a compton cloud which is located in the inner region in the form of cenbol ( ct95 ) .",
    "the physical parameters ( accretion rates , shock location , shock strength , mass ) of accretion process are extracted from the fitting of two component advective flow ( tcaf ) model ( see debnath et al . 2014 ; mondal et al .",
    "2014 ; jana et al .",
    "2016 ; molla et al . 2016 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "so , imaging a black hole surroundings would necessarily mean imaging of the keplerian disk along with the cenbol .",
    "ours is the first paper , which creates a composite image of both the components , namely , the keplerian and the sub - keplerian components which are accreting at different accretion rates after addition of realistic physical processes .",
    "we ignore the pre - shock region of sub - keplerian component since it is optically very thin and concentrate only on the centrifugal barrier region which primarily does the inverse comptonization to produce the power - law component .",
    "we ignored the radial velocity inside this barrier since the flow is highly subsonic till it reaches the inner sonic point located between the marginally bound and marginally stable orbits .",
    "we also present the corresponding spectra and images for various flow parameters .",
    "we find that multi - color black - body part of a spectrum becomes flat at higher inclination angles .",
    "the number of photons in higher energy bin ( @xmath181  kev ) increases with inclination angle .",
    "this is a clear effect of the focussing due to photon - bending .",
    "the spectra is harder at high inclination angles .",
    "our work has , for the first time , produced the images and also realistic spectra from a two component advective flow around a non - rotating black hole .",
    "due to intrinsic nature of our monte - carlo simulation , we can also not only study the effects of bending on the timing properties , but also determine the time and phase lag properties .",
    "similarly effects of spin would be very important and we would like to identify those features which are especially on spin dependent .",
    "this is outside the scope of this paper and would be reported elsewhere .",
