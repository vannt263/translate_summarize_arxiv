    "current imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) have already found @xmath5140 very high - energy ( vhe ; above 100  gev ) gamma - ray sources , including @xmath550 blazars up to redshift @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite reported detection of two vhe gamma - ray photons from the blazar pks 0426 - 380 at @xmath8 using the fermi gamma - ray telescope ( _ fermi _ ) .",
    "blazars , a class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , are the dominant population in the extragalactic gamma - ray sky . vhe gamma rays propagating through intergalactic space are attenuated by photon - photon pair production interaction ( @xmath9 ) with photons of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) from far - infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "recent studies have detected attenuation of gamma rays on ebl  , using a dataset dominated mostly by optical depth of the order of 1 .",
    "however , distant blazars appear to have harder spectra than one would expect from simple gamma - ray emission models  @xcite , as well as a redshift dependence of the observed spectral index that is different from what was expected  @xcite , although a large uncertainty remains in the measured redshifts and spectral indeces  @xcite .",
    "this has prompted a number of exotic scenarios based on hypothetical axion - like particles @xcite ( different from the qcd axion ) , as well as lorentz invariance violation @xcite as possible explanations of the spectral hardening .",
    "an alternative interpretation is the cascade emission from high energy protons propagating through intergalactic space .",
    "since agn jets are believed to be powerful sources of cosmic rays , protons generated in agn jets can interact with the ebl via the reactions @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "pions quickly decay into high energy photons and electrons .",
    "furthermore , the high - energy protons can interact with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons via @xmath12 .",
    "both of these channels initiate electromagnetic cascades distributed uniformly along the line of sight , and the highest energy gamma rays produced relatively close to the observer are not attenuated significantly by the ebl .",
    "interactions of high - energy protons with the photon backgrounds along the line of sight can produce point images of sources observable by iacts , as long as the intergalactic magnetic fields deep in the voids are in the femtogauss range  @xcite .",
    "the observed fluxes are comprised of two components : primary gamma - ray flux produced at the source or in the subsequent electromagnetic cascade ( not including any cosmic ray interactions ) , and secondary gamma - ray flux , which arises from line - of - sight interactions of cosmic rays .",
    "this secondary gamma - ray scenario can reproduce the observed spectra of distant blazars remarkably well  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the next generation iact , cherenkov telescope array ( cta )  @xcite , will be able to detect a large number of blazars with an extragalactic blank field sky survey @xcite .",
    "a statistical study of vhe blazars in the cta era will provide a crucial key to understanding of agn populations and high - energy phenomena around supermassive black holes in agns .",
    "however , the expected number of blazars to be observed above @xmath13  tev is limited by both the observational time and the interactions with the ebl  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to consider the impact of the secondary gamma rays on future blazar surveys by cta ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since secondary gamma rays avoid significant ebl attenuation at energies above @xmath13  tev @xcite .    for this purpose , the blazar gamma - ray luminosity function ( glf ) , primary spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , and secondary gamma - ray sed are needed .",

    "these models are in good agreement with the _ fermi _ data , and they allow one to predict blazar evolution at any wavelength by incorporating the glf with sed . in this paper , we use the model of ref .  @xcite to predict the expected number and redshift distributions of vhe blazars in future cta blank field sky surveys .",

    "our results are summarized in section 4 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the standard values of cosmological parameters @xmath14 .",
    "in refs .  @xcite and @xcite a blazar glf model was developed for luminosity at 100  mev @xmath15 based on the latest determination of x - ray luminosity function of agns @xcite , featuring the so called luminosity dependent density evolution .",
    "another new feature was taking into account the blazar sed sequence .",
    "blazar sequence is a feature seen in the mean sed of blazars that the synchrotron and ic peak photon energies decrease as the bolometric luminosity increases @xcite .",

    "the strength of the igmf is by and large unconstrained .",
    "theoretical models assuming the dynamo origin of galactic magnetic fields require primordial seed fields of @xmath25  g  @xcite , which can be considered as a theoretical lower limit , while the observational upper limit from faraday rotation is @xmath26  g  @xcite .",

    "blazar spectra provide a way to measure igmfs if the cosmic - ray contribution is taken into account  @xcite : the best - fit blazar spectra require igmfs in the range @xmath30  g. the upper limit ensures rectilinear propagation of cosmic - ray protons .",
    "the lower limit improves the fit to the low - energy part of the blazar spectra . in this paper",
    ", we consider two representative values of igmf strengths : @xmath1  g and @xmath4  g.    although agns are expected to accelerate cosmic rays , the spectrum of cosmic rays produced by agns are ambiguous .",
    "fortunately , the spectra of secondary gamma rays show almost no sensitivity to variations of the proton injection spectrum  @xcite .",
    "we assume the following form of the proton spectrum  @xcite : @xmath31 where we set @xmath32 , @xmath33  eev , and @xmath34  eev .",
    "this injection spectrum of protons is among the possibilities that reproduce the blazar spectra  @xcite . for the secondary gamma - ray calculation",
    ", we use the numerical code  @xcite .",
    "our calculation is based on kinetic equations ; it calculates the propagation of nucleons , stable leptons and photons using the standard dominant processes , i.e. pion production by nucleons , pair production by protons and neutron @xmath35decays .",
    "for electron - photon cascade development , it includes pair production and ic scattering . to model the effects of igmfs",
    ", we mimic deflections in electromagnetic cascades by assigning a finite lifetime to the cascade electrons , assuming that the magnetic field correlation length is always higher than the electrons mean free path ( i.e. @xmath36 ) and using the angular resolution of cta with array e @xcite .",
    "while this is a simplification , the results can be tested against the full monte - carlo calculations of essey et al .",
    "@xcite , and they agree sufficiently well for our purposes .",
    "secondary gamma - ray flux depends on the proton luminosity .",
    "jet power of blazars detected by _ fermi _ during its first 3-month survey was studied in ref .",

    "on the other hand , integration over galaxy number counts provides a firm lower bound on the ebl , and the observed trend of the counts with magnitude indicates that the ebl at @xmath43 has been largely resolved into discrete sources in the optical / nir bands  @xcite , even when the effect of incomplete detection due to cosmological dimming of surface brightness is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "combined with the lower limits from galaxy counts , the total ebl intensity at @xmath43 from 0.1 @xmath42 to 1000 @xmath42 is inferred to lie in the range 5299  @xmath44  @xcite .",

    "in contrast to  ( [ eq : horizon_prim ] ) the flux of secondary gamma rays with distance @xmath53 is approximated as @xcite @xmath57 then , @xmath52 becomes 3.0 at @xmath58 and @xmath59 at @xmath60 . in the first case",

    "we expect more sources assuming the secondary component dominates the gamma - ray flux , although flux from nearby sources is dominated by the primary flux .",
    "figure [ fig : lognlogs_itm10 ] shows the cumulative source count distributions in the entire sky above five energy thresholds ( 30 gev , 100 gev , 300 gev , 1 tev , and 10 tev ) .",
    "the cta @xmath62 , 50 hr detection limit with array e is also shown @xcite .",
    "absorption of blazar spectra by the ebl is taken into account using @xcite and secondary gamma rays is also taken into account using @xcite .",
    "when we do not take into account secondary gamma rays , the expected source counts are rapidly flattened at fainter flux and decrease at higher energy band due to the ebl attenuation effects .",

    "once we take into account secondary gamma rays , these numbers will increase as 720 , 840 , 760 , 460 , and 93 , and 630 , 650 , 530 , 360 , and 72 for the case of @xmath1  g and @xmath4  g , respectively . due to the magnetic deflection , the expected number of blazars is highly affected by the magnetic field strength especially at @xmath64 tev",
    ". it will be difficult to explain such a large number of blazars at @xmath65 tev by the evolution or the ebl modeling .",
    "evolution at each energy band should be similar and the gamma - ray horizon where gamma - ray opacity becomes unity is typically at @xmath66 and @xmath67 at 1 and 10 tev , respectively @xcite .",
    "if secondary gamma rays do not contribute significantly to vhe gamma - ray emission from blazars , there should be a large drop in blazar counts at higher energy .",
    "therefore , cumulative source count distribution will be a clear evidence of the secondary gamma rays .",
    "however , it requires @xmath68 hr to survey all sky with exposures of 50 hr at each fov assuming the fov of cta as @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "such an exposure is unrealistic for a wide survey limited in time .",
    "let us consider an all sky survey with a fixed observing time by multiple cta pointing observations assuming the fov of cta to be @xmath70 and considering array e configuration  @xcite .",
    "a 0.5 hr exposure of each fov will allow one to survey all sky ( @xmath71  str ) in @xmath2 hr ( i.e. @xmath72 pointing observations ) . since the typical total observable time for iacts is 1000 hr in a year , and cta will have both north and south sites to cover the entire sky , this long term observation can be accomplished as a multi - year project .",
    "we note that the detection limit of 0.5  hr exposure of cta is equivalent to that of 50  hr exposure of current generation of iacts .",
    "figure [ fig : cum_z ] shows the cumulative redshift distribution in the entire sky above five energy thresholds ( 30 gev , 100 gev , 300 gev , 1 tev , and 10 tev ) with 0.5 hr exposure for each fov .",
    "we estimate the 5@xmath73 sensitivity limit with 0.5  hr exposure from @xmath62 , 50  hr detection limit by assuming that sensitivity limit scales as the inverse square root of observation time  @xcite . for @xmath1  g ,",
    "the secondary gamma - ray scenario predicts 100 , 130 , 150 , 87 , and 8 blazars above 30 gev , 100 gev , 300 gev , 1 tev , and 10 tev , respectively . for @xmath4  g ,",
    "these numbers become 79 , 96 , 110 , 63 , and 6 , respectively .",
    "we summarize the expected blazar counts for this survey mode in table  [ tab : count_0.5hr ] .",
    "the highest redshift will extend up to @xmath0 and @xmath3 for @xmath1 and @xmath74  g , respectively .",
    "this prediction differs dramatically from what would be expected in the absence of secondary gamma rays , in which case the highest redshift is @xmath75 . as discussed above ,",
    "this difference arises because secondary gamma rays are generated not at the source , but continuously along the line of sight , and the fraction produced relatively close to the observer is not attenuated .",
    "since stronger igmf suppress the secondary gamma - ray flux at lower energy , lower igmf allows us to detect higher redshift objects .",
    "therefore , statistical samples with a shallow survey will allow one to obtain a clear evidence of the secondary gamma - ray production and to probe the igmf strength .    [",

    "the secondary gamma - ray scenario predicts the expected number of sources as 7 , 8 , 8 , 5 , and 1 above 30  gev , 100  gev , 300  gev , 1  tev , and 10  tev , respectively , in the case of @xmath1  g , while these numbers will be 6 , 7 , 5 , 4 , and 1 in the case of @xmath4  g. therefore , in a fixed observable time , a wider and shallower survey will have an advantage in being able to detect more sources in total , and more sources at higher redshifts , in all energy bands .    in this paper ,",
    "we assume @xmath77 ( see section .",
    "[ subsec:2nd ] for details ) . however , the ratio of proton and photon powers is still unknown . if proton power is ten times higher than photon power , @xmath78 , the expected counts for the all sky survey mode with 0.5 hr exposure for each fov will increase .",
    "those will be 490 , 620 , 690 , 440 , and 92 blazars above 30 gev , 100 gev , 300 gev , 1 tev , and 10 tev , respectively , for @xmath1  g , while those will be 320 , 400 , 440 , 330 , and 72 , respectively , for @xmath4  g. these counts are not simply scaled by a factor of 10 from those in the case of @xmath77 due to the cosmological evolution of blazars .",
    "after one determines the spectral template of primary gamma rays from blazars and the blazar glf at an energy band where ebl and secondary gamma rays do not alter the spectra of sources , cumulative source count distribution at vhe will enable one to constrain the strength of the igmf by comparing the observed counts with the expected counts . although one must assume a specific ebl model , ebl models are currently well constrained by various galaxy formation and reionization data ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note that there are uncertainties in the numbers predicted above .",
    "the use of the blazar sed sequence and the secondary gamma - ray sed is the key to converting the blazar luminosity function in the gev band into the vhe band .",

    "<S> very high - energy gamma - ray measurements of _ distant _ blazars can be well explained by secondary gamma rays emitted by cascades induced by ultra - high - energy cosmic rays . </S>",

    "<S> we show that the secondary emission process will allow cta to detect 100 , 130 , 150 , 87 , and 8 blazars above 30 gev , 100 gev , 300 gev , 1 tev , and 10 tev , respectively , up to @xmath0 assuming the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) strength @xmath1  g and an unbiased all sky survey with 0.5 hr exposure at each field of view , where total observing time is @xmath2 hr . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers will be 79 , 96 , 110 , 63 , and 6 up to @xmath3 in the case of @xmath4  g. this large statistics of sources will be a clear evidence of the secondary gamma - ray scenarios and a new key to studying the igmf statistically . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that a wider and shallower survey is favored to detect more and higher redshift sources even if we take into account secondary gamma rays .    </S>",
