    "the goal of current investigations in heavy - ion collisions is to establish the existence of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase and to study its properties .",
    "several signals have been proposed as indicators for its creation .",
    "however , no unambiguous proof has been established so far .",
    "a large part of the problem lies in the difficulty to separate effects of the evolution of the hot and dense medium from characteristic changes in the physics of reactions taking place inside this medium .",
    "therefore , it is mandatory to aim at a consistent description of as many observables as possible within a single model of the medium evolution .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have proposed a model for the evolution of a fireball assuming local thermal equilibrium and isentropic expansion . in this approach ,",
    "the evolution is constrained by two major pieces of information : first , by measured hadronic momentum spectra and hanbury - brown twiss ( hbt ) interferometry data which reflect the freeze - out state ; secondly , by information on the equation of state ( eos ) obtained in lattice simulations and represented in terms of a quasiparticle picture .",
    "we have demonstrated that this evolution scenario is in agreement with data on dilepton emission measured by the ceres collaboration @xcite .",
    "we have also used the same model to describe the emission of hard thermal photons @xcite and found good agreement with the data measured by wa98 @xcite .",
    "no explicit statement about the hadrochemical composition of the fireball is made in this model .",
    "instead , we use phenomenological arguments to include the effects of enhanced pion phase space density into the eos of hot hadronic matter . on the other hand ,",
    "statistical models are extremely successful in describing the measured ratios of different hadron species for a range of collision energies from sis to rhic ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to show that our fireball evolution model is consistent with the idea of statistical hadronization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we outline the version of statistical hadronization used in our model .",
    "after comments on technical details , we present results and compare to data both for sps and rhic conditions .",
    "we then investigate the sensitivity of these results to the model parameters , specifically we study the role of possible in - medium modifications of particle properties .",
    "we conclude by sketching a possible scenario in which in - medium modifiactions are possible while statistical hadronization is still in agreement with the data .",
    "the fireball evolution model outlined in @xcite contains a phase transition from partonic to hadronic matter .",
    "if one is interested in the composition of the hadronic system , one has to introduce a model of hadronization . in the present paper ,",
    "we assume that the particle content of the fireball at the critical temperature @xmath0 can be found by considering a system of ( non - interacting ) hadrons in chemical equilibrium , described by the grand canonical ensemble , which subsequently undergoes decay processes .",
    "this is based on ideas presented in @xcite , where it was shown that a huge number of hadron ratios can be explained by a fit of only two model parameters , temperature @xmath3 and baryochemical potential @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , the notion of non - interacting hadrons close to the phase boundary is not suitable for the description of the phase transition thermodynamics on a fundamental level , but should rather be regarded as an effective prescription .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the level - spacings and degeneracies of the qcd excitation spectrum along with the energy scale provided by the temperature already contain enough information to determine the relative contributions of different hadron species and that details of the interactions can either be absorbed into hadronic quasiparticle properties such as temperature dependent masses and widths or average out .",
    "the calculation of hadronic abundancies in this framework is a two step process : first , we have to specify the properties of the medium ( the qgp ) at the transition in terms of the densities of quarks , antiquarks and gluons ( this is most conveniently done by specifying the temperature @xmath0 and baryo- and strange chemical potentials @xmath5 ) .",
    "these parameters can be fit to the observed hadron ratios ( as done in @xcite ) , calculated within a dynamical model ( as done in the present paper for sps ) or inferred from experiment ( as done in the present paper for rhic ) .",
    "once the densities in the qgp have been specified , the hypothesis of statistical hadronization is used to map those into the hadron ratios observable in experiment . in detail , we use the following procedure to calculate ratios for sps :    employing the grand canonical ensemble , we expect the density for each particle species @xmath6 to be given by @xmath7/t_c\\}\\pm 1}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath8 denotes the degeneracy factor of particle species @xmath9 ( spin , isospin , particle / antiparticle ) , the + ( - ) sign is used for fermions ( bosons ) and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 stands for the particle s vacuum mass .",
    "we use a value of 170 mev for the critical temperature @xmath0 as determined in lattice calculations for two light and one heavy flavours @xcite and also used in the fireball evolution model .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath12 takes care of conserved baryon number @xmath13 and strangeness @xmath14 for each species : @xmath15 we neglect a ( small ) contribution @xmath16 coming from the isospin asymmetry in the colliding nuclei .",
    "the baryochemical potential @xmath4 is then fixed by the requirement that the net number of baryons inside the thermalized region is equal to the number of collision participants @xmath17 if the total volume @xmath18 is known : @xmath19 similarly , strangeness conservation demands @xmath20 thus , the only parameter of the model is the fireball volume @xmath18 . at the phase transition ,",
    "however , this volume can be determined from the eos of the qgp evaluated at @xmath21 using the entropy density @xmath22 as @xmath23 if the total entropy content @xmath24 of the fireball is known .",
    "this quantity , however , can be obtained from measuring charged particle multiplicities @xmath25 and @xmath26 in suitable rapidity bins and calculating @xmath27 the quantity @xmath28 stands for the inverse of the specific entropy per net baryon @xmath29 , and the product @xmath30 roughly measures the entropy per pion @xcite . for sps collisions at 160 agev",
    ", we find an entropy per net baryon @xmath31 for central collisons .    at rhic ,",
    "hadron ratios are measured at midrapidity .",
    "it is known that the distribution of baryon number across rapidity is very inhomogeneous at collider energies , hence a prediction of the quark and gluon densities within a globally averaged framework as outlined for the sps case using eqs .",
    "( [ e - baryons ] ) and ( [ e - volume ] ) is bound to fail . for the sake of simplicity , we will not attempt to calculate @xmath4 in a ( more complicated ) dynamical model but rather infer it from the experimentally accessible specific entropy end entropy , keeping in mind that our results for rhic do not test a dynamical model but only the statistical hadronization hypothesis ( in principle , however , the baryon distribution in rapidity is calculable , e.g. @xcite ) .    for rhic 6% central au - au collisions at 130 agev ,",
    "the specific entropy @xmath32 at midrapidity is substantially higher due to the larger particle multiplicity and the smaller net baryon content in the central region .",
    "the transition volume is then estimated by using the eos to determine the volume at which the measured entropy in the midrapidity slice correspond to the temperature @xmath0 if a backward extrapolation of the expansion in time is made .",
    "note , however , that the transition volume is only relevant for excluded volume corrections and can be neglected for a first order approximation since we are interested in hadron ratios and not total abundancies .",
    "thus , all ingredients entering eq .",
    "( [ e - gce ] ) are determined ( without additional free parameters ) and we can evaluate the expression for a suitable choice of hadrons and resonances .",
    "we include all mesons and mesonic resonances up to masses of 1.5 gev and all baryons and baryonic resonances up to masses of 2 gev .",
    "this amounts to 30 ( strange and nonstrange ) mesonic states and 36 ( nonstrange to multistrange ) baryonic states . in order to compare to experimental results ,",
    "we calculate their decay into particles which are long - lived as compared to the fireball , such as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    in order to account for interactions between particles , which at small distances become repulsive ,",
    "we assume a hard core radius @xmath35 of 0.3 fm for all particles and resonances .",
    "the corresponding excluded volume @xmath36 , with @xmath37 for all species , is subtracted from the volume obtained in eq .",
    "( [ e - volume ] ) , which in turn affects the total number of produced particles . as",
    "the excluded volume itself depends on the total number of particles , we iterate the correction for a self - consistent result . the hard core radius of 0.3 fm for protons is determined by comparison with p - p collisions @xcite . in the absence of such information for the other mesons and baryons , we assume its universality .",
    "all data on particles is taken from @xcite .",
    "for many higher - lying states , the properties as well as the decay channels are poorly known . in these cases , we proceed as follows : if a quantity ( e.g. masses and widths ) is given only within a certain range , the arithmetic mean of this range is used in the model .",
    "decay channels which are reported to be seen are assumed to receive equal contributions from the branching ratio which is left after all known channels have been accounted for .",
    "branching ratios less than 1% have been neglected .",
    "decay chains ( such as @xmath38 ) have been followed through . for resonances with large width",
    ", we integrate eq .",
    "( [ e - gce ] ) over the mass range of the resonance using a breit - wigner distribution .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the notion of a non - interacting hadronic resonance gas can not be expected to describe the full thermodynamics of the system close to the phase boundary .",
    "therefore , one can not expect all thermodynamical parameters to match smoothly coming from above and below the phase transition .",
    "an ensemble of free hadrons should therefore not be used to calculate thermodynamical properties of the hot hadronic medium , as there is strong evidence for re - scattering processes in the hadronic phase from dilepton emission ( see e.g. our result in @xcite ) and these interactions certainly modify the thermodynamics .",
    "this becomes apparent once we compare thermodynamic parameters directly .",
    "coming from above @xmath0 , we find from the quasiparticle model of the qgp @xmath39 calculating the corresponding hadronic resonance gas values at @xmath0 ( using the ensemble of particles and resonances described above ) , one obtains @xmath40 the crucial observation is that the entropy density matches smoothly ( one should keep in mind , however , that there are errors given by the extraction of @xmath0 from lattice data , the extrapolation of lattice data to physical quark masses and the poor knowledge of high - lying resonances ) .",
    "this implies that we have not introduced a gross violation of the number of available degrees of freedom ( which is important , as the goal of this study is to obtain particle numbers out of an _ isentropic _ expansion scenario with a crossover or second order phase transition ) .",
    "if the entropy density did not match at @xmath0 , we would have introduced a first order phase transition which would certainly lead to a breakdown of the simple , instantaneous hadronization scenario used here .    on the other hand ,",
    "in the pressure and energy density we find discontinuities at @xmath0 .",
    "the difference of the energy density in both phases can be regarded as acceptable given the uncertainties , but in the case of the pressure the discrepancy is large .",
    "it is , however , certainly conceiveable that attractive interactions in the system lower the pressure .",
    "thermodynamical consistency then fixes the energy density via @xmath41 , achieving continuity in both quantities . a more fundamental approach in order to achieve continuity of all parameters across the phase transition , however , faces other difficulties :    * any interacting model of hadrons will have to introduce additional coupling constants , which , at least for the high - mass resonance states , are poorly known . * incorporating all _ known _ interactions is of limited help : if one considers the free ensemble at @xmath0 , one finds e.g. that the sum of all excited @xmath42 states is larger than the number of @xmath43 .",
    "this is also true for the nucleon and nuclear resonances .",
    "hence , resonance states are no small contribution and can not be neglected .",
    "if one is interested in the number of pions resulting after resonance decays , the role of heavy resonances is even further enhanced due to very pion - rich decay channels of these heavy states . * accepting the limited knowledge of heavy - resonance properties",
    ", one might think of using some effective _ ad hoc _ prescription of restoring thermodynamical consistency .",
    "however , there is no unique way of doing so , therefore the model looses all predictive power .",
    "in contrast , statistical hadronization is a simple prescription and completely determined by at most two parameters , which in the present context are given by the fireball evolution model .",
    "therefore , it appears useful to accept the limitations of the present model for the benefit of a parameter - free calculation .",
    "the resulting hadron ratios are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - ratiosstd ] for the case of 158 agev central pb - pb collisions at sps , compared with the experimentally measured values @xcite .",
    "one observes that the overall agreement with data is satisfactory with few exceptions , though not quite as good as in e.g. @xcite where a two parameter fit to the data was performed .",
    "note that not only the ratios of hadron yields agree to experiment in the present approach but also the absolute numbers , as the baryochemical potential @xmath4 is explicitly linked to the ( known ) number of participants .",
    "the calculation yields a baryochemical potential @xmath44 mev and a strange chemical potential @xmath45 mev .",
    "note that these quantities depend on the number of resonances included into the calculation ; therefore , a direct comparison with the values obtained in other types of models is not necessarily meaningful .    for central collisions at rhic at 130 agev beam energy we present the results in fig .",
    "[ f - ratiosrhic ] and compare to experimental data measured around midrapidity @xcite . as the distribution of net baryon number in rapidity is very inhomogeneous at rhic , the naive application of eq .",
    "( [ e - baryons ] ) fails , as we obtain a low entropy per baryon , @xmath46 . at midrapidity , however , this ratio is closer to @xmath32 . using this value to calculate the ratios in a suitable interval around midrapidity",
    ", we find much better agreement to the data ( see fig .",
    "[ f - ratiosrhic ] ) . naturally , eqs .",
    "( [ e - baryons ] ) and ( [ e - volume ] ) can not be used in this case .",
    "instead , one has to consider the volume of the rapidity slice in question and the number of baryons found inside this interval ( which can either be predicted by a model of measured in experiment ) . starting with this number and @xmath29 , all ratios of produced hadrons within this rapidity slice",
    "are then predicted .",
    "clearly , a more detailed fireball evolution model for the rhic scenario is desirable to increase the predictive power .",
    "in the last section , we have demonstrated that the idea of statistical hadronization combined with our fireball evolution model is able to achieve good agreement in comparison with data , provided that one uses the vacuum masses and widths of all resonances in eq .",
    "( [ e - gce ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "we have used the same fireball evolution to calculate dilepton emission and here we found that a significant broadening of the @xmath47 meson was responsible for the observed enhancement in the invariant mass region below 700 mev @xcite .",
    "the underlying thermal field theory calculations of the modifications of the vector meson properties at finite temperature @xcite and density @xcite indicate not only a modified @xmath47 but also broadening and mass shift of the @xmath48 and broadening of the @xmath49 due to the interaction with the medium .",
    "all these calculations ( as any other perturbative expansion ) become unreliable in the vicinity of the phase transition , therefore these results can not strictly be taken over to the current calculations where we require these quantities close to @xmath0 .",
    "however , we may take them as a hint that two possible modifications of particle properties in a hot and dense medium may take place :    _ mass shifts _ of particles in the medium are commonly related to the restoration of chiral symmetry . in e.g. @xcite , by investigating scale invariance of an effective lagrangian , the in - medium scaling laws @xmath50 were established ( brown - rho scaling ) . in this equation , asterisks denote quantities at finite density , @xmath51 and @xmath52 the masses of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 meson , @xmath52 is the nucleon mass and @xmath53 stands for the chiral condensate .",
    "_ decay widths _ of particles are in general increased in a medium due to the presence of new interaction channels . in @xcite e.g. , it was shown that the @xmath48 meson resonance experiences strong broadening in a hot environment due to the presence of the scattering process @xmath54 . even in the absence of such effects , the decay width at finite temperature is enhanced if the decay products are bosons due to the presence of bosons of the same type in the heat bath ( bose - enhancement ) .",
    "as pions are the most abundant species in a thermal environment and most decays involve one or more pions , this effect should influence almost all resonances in a hot medium .",
    "the modification of decay widths is only relevant in eq .",
    "( [ e - gce ] ) if the in - medium width is a sizable fraction of the particle mass . in this case , a large contribution to the particle yield comes from masses lower than the peak mass in the breit - wigner distribution , which are exponentially enhanced .",
    "this enhancement more than counterbalances the suppression of contributions shifted into the higher mass region .",
    "therefore , an increase in the decay width of broad resonances acts similarly as a mass reduction .",
    "there is a third possibility of in - medium particle properties which has no direct influence on the particle spectral function ( and is therefore not visible in the dilepton data ) : the binding potential between the constituents of hadrons could be partially screened by thermal fluctuations , leading to an increase of the hadronic core radius .",
    "such _ increased radii _ would lead to an enhanced excluded volume correction .",
    "this effect hardly influences the results of @xcite , as the fireball volume is implicitly determined by matching the fitted baryochemical potential to the number of participants , but in the present approach we can expect to observe the influence of increased hard core radii , as the volume is kept fixed .    in a first step",
    ", we examine the effects of in - medium mass shifts in a qualitative way by tentatively multiplying the vacuum masses of all hadrons with the exception of the pion by a constant @xmath55 . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - mvar ] .",
    "the result shows that even a moderate mass reduction of 10% in the medium is not in line with the observed hadron ratios .",
    "in particular , particle - antiparticle ratios are strongly affected . in the case of @xmath56",
    ", one might argue that the relevant inelastic ( annihilation ) cross section is not small as compared to the elastic one and therefore this ratio can not really be fixed at @xmath0 , but must be adjusted dynamically in the subsequent evolution .",
    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite that this is possible if one takes the statistical hadronization prediction as an initial condition for rate equations .",
    "it is unclear if this is still possible for different initial conditions , but even if this is the case , this is not an option for the multistrange particle / antiparticle ratios .",
    "the overall behaviour of the result can be qualitatively understood as follows : the reduced nucleon mass implies a lower value of the baryochemical potential in order to produce the observed number of participants , this in turn affects single and double strange particles and implies changes in @xmath57 via eq .",
    "( [ e - strangeness ] ) .",
    "therefore , ratios of particles and antiparticles with 2 or 3 non - strange valence quarks , such as @xmath56 or @xmath58 are most affected .",
    "multistrange particle / antiparticle pairs follow the trend , though in a way less pronounced .    in a second run",
    ", we investigate the effect of thermal broadening of resonances , increasing all widths by a constant multiplicative factor @xmath59 .",
    "the resulting hadron ratios are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - gammavar ] .",
    "one observes the same qualitative behaviour as for a mass reduction , as we have argued before .",
    "the effects of the increased width are , however , less dramatic .",
    "an increase by 20% in the width of all resonances is still in line with all data except @xmath56 and even an increase of 50% is still acceptable for most of the ratios .",
    "this is reassuring , as there is almost certainly thermal broadening of resonances in a hot medium .",
    "as the behaviour for both broadening of resonances and mass reduction ( which are both in line with the dilepton data ) is qualitatively the same for the hadron ratios , the effects of reduced masses can not be compensated by introducing additional broadening .",
    "so if any of the effects fails in the description of the data , a combination of both will also fail .    in the third run",
    ", we explore the effect of different choices for the core radius @xmath60 on the ratios . in order to investigate the sensitivity of our results to the initial choice of @xmath60 , we do not only consider thermally increased radii but also a reduced initial choice . in fig .",
    "[ f - rvar ] , we show the model predictions for a reduction of @xmath60 by 25% and for an increase of the same amount .    we observe that the overall sensitivity of the resulting hadron ratios to the hadronic core radius is rather weak . on the other hand , an enhanced excluded volume correction ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ f - rvar ] ) acts in a rather peculiar way : in order to arrive at the same number of participants , the baryochemical potential has to _",
    "increase_. this effect is opposite to the behaviour for in - medium mass reductions or increase of decay width .",
    "therefore , one might expect that the net effect of both thermal broadening of resonances _ and _ increased core radius due to a thermally screened binding potential is moderate and partial compensation may occur .    in order to test this conjecture",
    ", we study a scenario in which the width of resonances has been increased by 50% and simultaneously the core radius has been set to 0.45 fm instead of 0.3 fm .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - radius ] .",
    "one observes that indeed the expected compensation occurs and the model prediction approaches the data points . no effort has been made to obtain a best description of the data using @xmath59 and @xmath61 as fit parameters .",
    "assuming a thermalized system and statistical hadronization at the phase boundary with subsequent resonance decays , we have demonstrated that our recently proposed fireball evolution scenario @xcite leads to a reasonable description of the data on hadron ratios , if the known vacuum properties of particles and resonances are used .",
    "this provides a valuable consistency check of three pieces of information : 1 ) the entropy density at @xmath62 mev can be calculated using the hadronic ensemble .",
    "the entropy density of the qgp has to agree with that number in order to produce a second order transition or a crossover , as assumed in the fireball evolution scenario .",
    "2 ) the quasiparticle model predicts the entropy density at @xmath0 , but without specifying an absolute value for @xmath0 .",
    "3 ) the essential information of the absolute value of @xmath0 is obtained in lattice calculations @xcite , and using this value , we find a consistent scenario . in that sense , hadron ratios provide information on the eos of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "on the other hand , in - medium modifications of hadron properties are mandatory if one tries to explain the dilepton invariant mass spectrum measured by the ceres collaboration @xcite .",
    "specifically , the @xmath47 channel requires strong broadening .",
    "thermal effective field theory calculations indicate the presence of such effects for other particles as well @xcite .    in a schematic investigation",
    ", we have demonstrated that such strong broadening of resonances or mass reductions are not in line with the measured data , and no combination of these two effects can be .",
    "such changes in particle properties are also inconsistent with the phase transition scenario used here , as they destroy the match of the entropy density and require in general a different choice of @xmath0 .",
    "this is also apparent from the fact that the _ absolute _ numbers of particle production do not agree with measurements .",
    "however , if one also consideres the effect of a screened binding potential in a thermal environment , one can make the assumption that the core radius of hadrons grows .",
    "this effect can then compensate the effects of both increased decay widths and mass reductions to some degree , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f - radius ] .",
    "this result is reassuring , as it allows to reconcile the in - medium modifications observed in the dilepton data with the statistical model description of measured hadron ratios in a consistent model framework .",
