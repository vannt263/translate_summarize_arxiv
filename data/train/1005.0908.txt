    "porous materials are ubiquitous in nature and extensively used as industrial materials .",
    "examples are referred to wood , bricks , metals , foams , ceramics , carbon and explosives .",
    "the use of porous materials in parts may lead to reduced weight , improved structural and mechanical properties , better heat transfer , greater motion and deformation control , etc@xcite . besides others",
    ", they have also been used in surgical implant design to fabricate devices to replace or augment soft and hard tissues@xcite .",
    "although the study on shock wave reaction on porous materials has a long history .",
    "most of previous studies were focussed on the global behaviors , such as the hugoniots@xcite and the equation of state@xcite .",
    "the dynamical procedures involve much richer physical behaviors but in fact are much less extensively investigated .    the main challenges for studying the dynamical behaviors in shocked porous material are twofold : the first is the numerical tool , the second is the scheme to analyze the simulation data . from the simulation side ,",
    "an appropriate simulation tool must overcome two constraints .",
    "the first is the scale limitation .",
    "molecular dynamics can discover some atomistic mechanisms of shock - induced void collapse@xcite , but the spatial and temporal scales it may cover are far from being comparable with experiments . to overcome the scale limitation , one solution is to develop some mesoscopic particle methods .",
    "the second constraint is the numerical stability .",
    "traditional simulation methods , both the eulerian and lagrangian ones , when treating with the dynamics of structured and/or porous materials , encountered severe difficulties .",
    "the reason is that material under investigation is generally highly distorted during the collapsing of cavities .",
    "the eulerian description is not convenient for tracking interfaces .",
    "lagrangian formulation has to rezone the meshes to restore proper shapes .",
    "the mapping of state fields of mass density , velocities and stresses from the distorted mesh to the newly generated one is not easy and introduces errors . in this study",
    "we use a mixed method , material - point method(mpm)@xcite , to study shock wave reaction on porous materials . as a step to approach the shock wave dynamics in porous materials ,",
    "we have carefully studied the cavity collapse in shocked materials@xcite .",
    "as for the second challenge , data analysis and information picking up , a relatively straightforward way is to study the local averaged values and the corresponding fluctuations of state variables@xcite . in ref.@xcite , the evolution of local turbulence mixing and volume dissipation",
    "were also studied .",
    "shock wave reaction results in various characteristic regimes in porous materials , for example , regimes with high temperature , regimes with high pressure , regimes with high particle speeds , etc .",
    "these characteristic regimes are generally highly concerned in practical applications . regimes with high temperature are places where initiation may start in energetic materials . regimes with high pressure are places where phase transition may occur .",
    "regimes with high particle speed are places where jet phenomena may occur .",
    "to understand the characteristic regimes defined by @xmath7 , we@xcite introduced the minkowski functionals to measure their morphological behaviors , where @xmath8 is a physical variable under consideration , like the temperature , density , some specific stress , particle velocity or its components , @xmath9 a given threshold value .",
    "previous studies showed that the porous metal aluminum(al)@xcite and porous hmx - like material@xcite show significant differences under shock wave reaction . to clarify the effects of single material parameters and present indicative information for material designs , it is interesting to have a through study on the shock behaviors in relation to their mechanical property ranging from hyper - plastic to pure elastic@xcite .",
    "in present paper we focus on characteristic regimes with high temperature .",
    "we organize the following part of the paper as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly introduces the material model and the numerical method .",
    "section 3 outlines the morphological characterization for characteristic regimes manifested by turing patterns .",
    "simulation results are shown and analyzed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 makes the conclusion .",
    "the porous material is fabricated by a solid body with a number of randomly distributed voids embedded .",
    "the solid body follows an associative von mises plasticity model with linear kinematic and isotropic hardening@xcite .",
    "the pressure @xmath10 is calculated by using the mie - grneissen equation of state which can be written as @xmath11[e - e_{h}(v_{h})]$ ] , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are pressure , specific volume and energy on the rankine - hugoniot curve , respectively .",
    "the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath15 can be estimated by experiments and be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the initial density and specific volume of the solid material , @xmath19 the sound speed , @xmath20 the coefficient in hugoniot velocity relation .",
    "both the shock compression and the plastic work @xmath21 cause the increasing of temperature . the increasing of temperature from shock compression",
    "can be calculated as : @xmath22^{3}}-\\frac{% \\gamma ( v)}{v_{h}}t_{h}.   \\label{eq - eos - temprshock}\\]]where @xmath23 is the specific heat .",
    "eq.([eq - eos - temprshock ] ) can be derived from the thermal equation and the mie - grneissen equation of state@xcite .",
    "the increasing of temperature from plastic work can be calculated as : @xmath24 .",
    "we model shocked materials with continuously varying mechanical properties .",
    "the reference material is the metal aluminum .",
    "the corresponding parameters are as below : density in solid portion @xmath25 kg / m@xmath26 , yang s module @xmath27 mpa , poisson s ratio @xmath28 , initial yield @xmath29 mpa , tangential module @xmath30 mpa , sound speed @xmath31 km / s , characteristic coefficient in the hugoniot velocity relation @xmath32 , specific heat @xmath33 j/(kg@xmath34k ) , heat conduction coefficient @xmath35 w/(m@xmath34k ) , and grneissen coefficient @xmath36 .",
    "the initial temperature of the material is 300 k. in simulations a wide range of the yield @xmath37 will be used .",
    "the material point method is a relatively new particle method in computational solid mechanics .",
    "this method uses a regular structured grid as a computational scratchpad for computing spatial gradients of field variables .",
    "the grid is convected with the particles during deformations that occur over a time step , eliminating the diffusion problems associated with advection on an eulerian grid .",
    "the grid is restored to its original location at the end of a time step .",
    "in addition to avoiding the eulerian diffusion problem , this approach also circumvents problems with mesh entanglement that can plague fully lagrangian - based techniques when large deformations are encountered .",
    "the mpm has also been successful in solving problems involving impact , etc .",
    "it has an advantage over traditional finite element methods in that the use of the regular grid eliminates the need for doing costly searches for contact surfaces .",
    "details of the scheme is referred to our previous publications@xcite .",
    "a variety of techniques can be used to describe the complex spatial distribution and time evolution of physical quantities in the shocked porous material . in this study",
    "we concentrate on the set of statistics known as minkowski functionals@xcite .",
    "the minkowski functionals has been successfully used to characterize patterns in reaction - diffusion systems@xcite , spinodal decomposition@xcite , fluctuations of cosmic microwave background@xcite , block copolymer systems@xcite and to reconstruct complex materials@xcite .",
    "assume @xmath8 is a physical quantity being interesting to us , then the regions with @xmath7 in the shocked porous material are referred to as characteristic regimes , where @xmath9 is a threshold value of @xmath8 . to simplify the analysis of the complex physical field ,",
    "we first condense the physical field as two kinds of characteristic regimes , the white and the black .",
    "the white correspond to regimes with @xmath38 and the black correspond to regimes with @xmath39 . for such turing patterns , a general theorem of integral geometry states that all properties of a @xmath40-dimensional convex set which satisfy motion invariance and additivity ( called morphological properties )",
    "are contained in @xmath41 numerical values @xcite . for a condensed temperature field , the white correspond to the high - temperature regimes and the black correspond to the low - temperature regimes .",
    "the high - temperature regimes are also generally referred to  hot - spots \" .    for a two - dimensional temperature map ,",
    "the three minkowski functionals correspond geometrically to the total fractional area @xmath0 of the high - temperature regimes , the boundary length @xmath42 between the high- and low - temperature regimes regimes per unit area , and the euler characteristic @xmath43 per unit area ( equivalent to the topological genus ) .",
    "when we increase the temperature threshold @xmath3 from the lowest temperature to the highest one , the high - temperature area @xmath0 will decrease from @xmath44 to @xmath45 ; the boundary length @xmath42 first increases from @xmath45 , then arrives at a maximum value , finally decreases to @xmath45 again .",
    "there are several ways to define the euler characteristic @xmath43 .",
    "two simplest one is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is the number of connected white ( black ) regimes , @xmath49 is the total number of pixels .",
    "in contrast to the area @xmath0 and boundary length @xmath42 , the euler characteristic @xmath43 describes the connectivity of the characteristic regimes in the material .",
    "it describes the patterns in a purely topological way , i.e. , without referring to any kind of metric .",
    "it is negative ( positive ) if many disconnected black ( white ) regimes dominate the image .",
    "a vanishing euler characteristic indicates a highly connected structure with equal amount of black and white regimes .",
    "the ratio @xmath50 describes the mean curvature of the boundary line separating black and white regimes .",
    "more discussions and calculation schemes of the minkowski functionals are referred to refs.@xcite .    among the three minkowski functionals ,",
    "the high - temperature area @xmath0 is the only one which monotonically increases in the shock - loading procedure and/or when the threshold value becomes smaller . for a given @xmath3 ,",
    "its increasing rate , @xmath51 , presents meaningful information .",
    "when the temperature threshold @xmath3 becomes higher , @xmath51 decreases .",
    "the variations of @xmath0 , @xmath42 and @xmath52 with @xmath3 and time @xmath53 compose a scenario for the shock response of porous material@xcite .",
    "if denote the mean density of the porous body as @xmath54 , then the porosity of the material is @xmath55@xcite .",
    "the shock to target body is loaded by colliding with a rigid wall being static at the bottom position @xmath56 .",
    "the initial velocity of the porous body is @xmath57 .",
    "the collision starts at time @xmath58 .",
    "the height and width of the porous body are 5 mm and 1 mm , respectively .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used in the horizontal directions , which means that the real system is composed of many of the simulated ones aligned periodically in the horizontal direction .",
    "figure 1 presents a series of snapshots in the shock loading procedure , where the porosity @xmath60 and initial velocity @xmath61 m/s , the time @xmath621000ns . from left to right and from top to bottom , the two rows of snapshots are for cases with @xmath6312 , 120 , 3000 , 8000 , 10000 , 12000 , 15000 , 20000 mpa , respectively .",
    "the points in the figure correspond to the material particles .",
    "the color from blue to red corresponds to increasing of temperature . from fig.1",
    "one can find the moving down of upper free surface and moving up of global compressive - waves series .",
    "for each case , the initial shock wave is decomposed as a complex series of compressive and rarefactive waves . in the shock loading procedure ,",
    "the compressive effects dominate . within the shocked region ,",
    "both the plastic work and shock compression make the temperature increase . in the present case , the plastic work dominates .",
    "the high - temperature regimes in materials with higher initial yields are more dispersed .",
    "the increasing rate of high - temperature area @xmath5 is different when the initial yield changes .    to quantify and get a more complete understanding on the shock wave response behavior ,",
    "we show a set of morphological measures versus time in fig.2(a ) , where values of initial yields are shown in the legend .",
    "the temperature threshold here is @xmath64400 k. with the propagation of compressive - wave - series in the porous material , the high - temperature area @xmath0 first increases with time in a parabolic way , then approaches to a saturation value slowly , keeps the saturation value for a period , finally decreases .",
    "the final decrease indicates that rarefactive waves are reflected back from the upper free surface and are decreasing the mean pressure and temperature , an amount of material particles changed their temperature from @xmath65 to @xmath66 . during the saturation period ,",
    "more compressive waves arrived at the upper free surface , consequently , more rarefactive waves are reflected back into the porous body .",
    "the former tends to increase the temperature , while the latter tends to decrease .",
    "the two effects are nearly balanced .",
    "therefore , the high - temperature area @xmath0 keeps nearly a constant .    as for effects of the initial yield @xmath2 , we can find two interesting phenomena : both the initial increasing rate and the saturation value of @xmath0 first increase , then decrease when the material changes from being superplastic to pure elastic . for cases checked in our numerical experiments ,",
    "the increasing rate @xmath51 becomes larger when the initial yield @xmath2 increases from @xmath45 to about @xmath67 gpa .",
    "if @xmath2 further to increase , @xmath51 will decrease .",
    "the saturation value @xmath68 of high - temperature area becomes larger when @xmath2 increases from being very small to about @xmath44 gpa .",
    "when @xmath2 becomes larger , the saturation value @xmath68 decreases . for the time interval shown fig .",
    "2(a ) , when @xmath69 gpa , the saturation value @xmath68 decreases and the period for @xmath70 becomes shorter with the increasing of @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath71 gpa , @xmath72 during the period @xmath73 ns @xmath74 ns ; when @xmath75 gpa , @xmath0 increases slowly from @xmath76 to @xmath77 during the period @xmath78 ns @xmath79ns ; when @xmath80 gpa , @xmath81 and have a local minimum value @xmath82 at about @xmath83ns .",
    "when @xmath84 gpa , the area @xmath0 keeps very small .",
    "now we check the information given by the boundary length and euler characteristic in fig.2(a ) . for all cases shown in the figure , the boundary length @xmath42 first increases ,",
    "then decreases with time .",
    "the former increase corresponds to the propagation of compressive waves and the appearance of more hot - spots .",
    "the decreasing of @xmath85 is not monotonic .",
    "the initial decrease corresponds to the coalescence of some hot - spots , the latter decrease corresponds to the coming in of the global rarefactive waves from the upper free surface , which result in expanding and coalescence of some cold - spots .",
    "a prominent behavior here is that , for the case with @xmath80 gpa , the boundary length @xmath42 has the largest value . for this case ,",
    "the value of @xmath52 changes from being slightly positive to being the most negative . combining information of @xmath0 , @xmath42 and @xmath52",
    ", we can know that , with the propagation of compressive wave in the porous material , the number of hot - spots with @xmath86k quickly increases , but distributes quite scatterredly .",
    "after corresponding compressive wave scanned all the material body , some scattered cold - spots with @xmath87k expand and partly coalescence due to the coming in of rarefactive waves . during this procedure ,",
    "some small hot - spots with @xmath86k disappear .",
    "therefore , both the high - temperature area @xmath0 and boundary length @xmath42 decrease and the euler characteristic @xmath52 becomes more negative . for other cases , the smaller the boundary length @xmath42 , the flatter the wave front in the temperature map .",
    "the material with @xmath75 gpa has the secondary maximum boundary length @xmath42 and more flatter @xmath88 curve than the material with @xmath89 gpa .",
    "this means that the numbers of hot - spots and cold - spots do not have much difference .",
    "the number of cold - spots dominates slightly during the time interval shown in the figure .    in the shock loading procedure ,",
    "if we decrease the threshold value @xmath3 , the wave fronts in the pixelized temperature map becomes flater .",
    "consequently , the values of @xmath85 are smaller , the @xmath90 values are closer to zero , and the curves for @xmath5 becomes closer to be linear .",
    "if we increase the threshold value @xmath3 , the pixelized temperature map shows different geometric and topological behaviors .",
    "examples are referred to figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) .",
    "@xmath91k in fig .",
    "2(b ) and @xmath92k in fig .",
    "it is clear that the saturation values of @xmath5 decrease with the increasing of @xmath3 . in the shock - loading procedure",
    ", the material with @xmath71 mpa has about @xmath93 of material particles can not get a temperature higher than 600k and @xmath94 can not get the temperature higher than 500k , and only @xmath95 can not get the temperature higher than 400k . for the material with @xmath96 mpa , in the shock loading procedure , there are about @xmath97 of material particles can not get the temperature higher than 600k , @xmath98 can not get the temperature higher than 500k , and only @xmath95 can not get the temperature higher than 400k .    when the initial yield is very high , for example , @xmath75gpa , the material is very elastic .",
    "consequently , the saturation value @xmath99 of high - temperature area is small .",
    "for example , @xmath100 when @xmath101k , which means that @xmath102 of material particles can not get the temperature higher than 600k .",
    "for the case with @xmath80gpa , @xmath103 when @xmath104k , @xmath105 when @xmath106k and @xmath107 when @xmath101k .",
    "for the case with @xmath84gpa , only @xmath108 of material particles can get a temperature higher than 600k in the shock loading procedure . in the temperature pattern with @xmath109k , the case of @xmath80gpa",
    "has a largest boundary length .",
    "when @xmath110k , the case of @xmath75gpa has a largest boundary length .",
    "when @xmath111k , the case of @xmath112gpa has the largest @xmath42 .      with the decreasing of initial shock strength , both the highest and the mean temperatures in the shocked portion decrease .",
    "a set of minkowski measures for the shocking procedure of porous materials with various initial yields are shown in fig.3 , where @xmath113 and @xmath3=400k .",
    "the initial impact velocities are different in figs .",
    "( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "they are 800 m/s , 600 m/s and 400 m/s , respectively .",
    "the values of initial yields are shown in the legends . specifically ,",
    "the initial yields are 12 , 120 , 1000,3000 , 5000 , 8000 , 10000 , 15000 and 20000mpa in fig.3(a ) ; in fig.3(b ) they are 12 , 120 , 360 , 1000,3000 , 5000 , 8000 , 10000 and 15000mpa ; in fig.3(c ) they are 12 , 120 , 360 , 1000,3000 , 5000 , 8000 , 10000 , and 20000mpa . compared with cases shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , both the saturation value @xmath68 and the increasing rate @xmath114 of the high - temperature area decrease when the initial shock becomes weaker . as an example , for the material with @xmath631000mpa , when the initial impact velocity is @xmath1151000 m/s , there are 99% of material particles arrive at the temperature higher than 400k in the shock - loading procedure ; when @xmath115800 m/s , the fraction of material particles getting the temperature higher than 400k is 97% ; when @xmath115600 m/s , the fraction is 89% ; when @xmath115400 m/s , the fraction becomes only 5% .    in fig.3(c ) , the case of @xmath633000 mpa has the maximum high - temperature area @xmath0 , boundary length @xmath42 and euler characteristic @xmath52 . in this figure , only after the high - temperature area @xmath0 gets its maximum value , it begins to decrease , which means that , under such a shock strength , most material particles can not get a temperature higher than 400k , the threshold value 400k has been very close to the highest temperature in this system . to understand better why the maximum high - temperature area occurs at about t=2000ns , we show the configurations with condensed temperature map in fig.4 , where the three snapshots are for the times t=1500ns , 2000ns and 2500ns , respectively .",
    "the areas with temperature higher than 400k are shown in yellow , other areas are shown in blue .",
    "one can find that the high - temperature area at time t=2000ns is the largest among the three snapshots . from the heights of the upper free surface",
    ", one can find that the one for t=2000ns is the lowest , which means that the shock - loading procedure finishes at about that time .",
    "when the unloading procedure starts , the area with high - temperature decreases . from fig.4 one can also find that the high - temperature regimes for @xmath109k have been very dispersed .",
    "this is consistent with the large value of boundary length , and consistent with the above observation that only a small portion of material particles get the temperature higher than 400k under such a shock strength .",
    "as mentioned above , among the three minkowski functionals , the high - temperature area @xmath5 is the only one being monotonic when the threshold value @xmath3 decreases and/or with the going on of the shock - loading procedure .",
    "it is natural to check if @xmath5 shows the same behavior when using appropriate ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) pairs .",
    "figure 5 shows such examples for the case with initial impact velocity @xmath1151000 m/s . in fig.5 ,",
    "the temperature threshold for reference material , aluminum , is 420k . from fig .",
    "5 we can find that materials with different initial yields , if we choose an appropriate @xmath3 to observe , the high - temperature area @xmath5 shows the same behavior in the shock - loading procedure .",
    "such a property can be understood better by observing figs . 1 and 4 . from figs . 1 and 4",
    ", it is also clear that , for a fixed shock strength , with the increasing of the initial yield , the wave front becomes wider , the high - temperature regimes becomes more scattered , more low - temperature domains are embedded in the compressed portion .",
    "this morphological behavior is manifested by larger boundary lengths and more negative euler characteristics in fig.5 .",
    "if use the ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) pairs in fig.5 as coordinates , we get the curve labeled by  @xmath116=1000 m/s \" and  al : 120 \" in fig.6 . for the shock strength @xmath1151000 m/s",
    ", the material with @xmath635gpa has the maximum @xmath3 which is about 590k . in this case",
    ", the shock contributes the maximum plastic work and the system has the highest temperature .",
    "if increase the temperature threshold @xmath3 to 460k , 540k and 570k , we have the other three curves . along each of them",
    ", @xmath5 shows the same behavior in the shock - loading procedure .",
    "if decrease the shock strength to @xmath115800 m/s , 600 m/s and 400 m/s , we get the other three plots of fig.6 . the maximum value point @xmath6 moves towards the lower value of the initial yield when the shock wave becomes weaker . in the shock loading procedure , if we decrease the threshold value @xmath3 , the wave fronts becomes flater .",
    "consequently , @xmath85 curves become smaller , @xmath90 becomes closer to zero ; the curves for @xmath5 becomes closer to be linear .",
