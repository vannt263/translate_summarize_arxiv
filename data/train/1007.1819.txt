    "rewriting codes are a coding - theoretic approach to allow rewriting to memories which have some type of write restriction , typically values stored in memory may only be increased .",
    "while codes for binary media were proposed in the 1980s @xcite , @xcite , within the past few years , a large number of rewriting codes directed at flash memory have been described @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "most of these these codes are designed for flash memory cells that can store one of @xmath0 discrete levels , where the values can only increase on successive rewrites .",
    "however , in the physical flash cell , charge is stored during write operations .",
    "charge , read as a voltage , is an inherently continuous quantity .",
    "commercial flash memory integrated circuits use analog - to - digital conversion , and present @xmath1 bits per cell of digital data externally .",
    "currently , any coding , for error - correction and rewriting , must operate on these discrete values .",
    "however , one might expect that future coding schemes may have access to the continuous , or analog values stored in the flash memory cells .",
    "this paper describes a rewriting code based upon lattices , and assumes that the analog values are available for coding .",
    "the values stored in flash cells correspond to lattice points . from a lattice perspective , conventional rewriting codes stores data at the points @xmath2 , in a rectangular lattice",
    ". however , rectangular lattices are inefficient , and there exist lattices that have many desirable properties such as better packing efficiency .",
    "because the flash cell values are continuous quantities , this paper takes the signal - space viewpoint that has long been used for the awgn channel . among other results",
    ", it is now known that lattices can achieve the capacity of the awgn channel @xcite @xcite , and lattices appear to be a promising practical approach for bandwidth - constrained channels @xcite .",
    "in fact , a related technique , trellis - coded modulation , has already been considered for error - correction in flash memories @xcite . in this",
    "paper , error - correction is not explicitly considered , however it is an important aspect of using lattices in flash memories .",
    "an important consideration for both flash memories and awgn channels is the power constraint . for awgn channels ,",
    "the average power constraint induces an ideally spherically - shaped codebook , which can be well - approximated by a shaping region equal to the voronoi region of high dimensional lattices .",
    "however , encoding in a shaping region requires computationally expensive lattice quantization @xcite .",
    "but for flash memories , the  peak \" power constraint is cubic , that is , all points are within the cube @xmath3 , corresponding to the fact that the voltage on each cell has a minimum and maximum possible value .",
    "fortunately , lattice quantization is not required . as was shown by sommer , et  al .",
    ", when the lattice has a triangular generator matrix , there is an efficient encoding which results in a cubic shaping region @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a slight generalization of this method .",
    "the proposed code partitions the signal space into @xmath4 blocks with maximum volume @xmath5 ; these terms will be defined in the next section , but one may assume @xmath6 .",
    "some , but not necessarily all blocks , have a one - to - one mapping between information and lattice points contained within that block . when the memory is to be rewritten with new information , a new codeword either within the same block , or in an adjoining block , is selected , such that the cell values are only increased . while there are multiple codeword candidates that can encode the new information , the codeword which maximizes the future number of rewrites",
    "is selected .",
    "the triangular - generator lattice encoding is linear , but unfortunately the linearity presents a problem . when new data is to be written to the memory , under a linear construction there is exactly one new codepoint nearest the current state codepoint .",
    "but if at least one component of the current state is near the boundary , then with some probability , the nearest ",
    "codepoint \" will be a phantom , outside of the power constraint",
    ". it might be acceptable to select another , suboptimal codepoint .",
    "but because of linearity , all such codepoints are phantoms and unaccessible .",
    "accordingly , a random  hash \" is introduced .",
    "this destroys the linearity , and requires a procedure to select the candidate codeword which is most suitable for rewriting .",
    "but its purpose is to increase the average number of times the memory may be written .",
    "while rewriting codes for flash memories have received some research attention , error - correction coding for flash memories is of considerable practical importance @xcite @xcite .",
    "there have been only a few studies on the dual - purpose codes which can both correct errors and allow rewriting @xcite @xcite",
    ". however , the simple concatenation of a rewriting code and error - correction code appears to be problematic .",
    "encoding the rewriting code followed by a systematic error - correction code means that parity bits are not rewritable . on the other hand , switching the concatenation results in no guarantees of minimum distance , since most rewriting codes do not appear to be systematic .",
    "however , lattices considered in this paper have a natural error - correction property , due do the euclidean distance that separates the points .",
    "while this paper assumes there is no noise , the goal is to show that a rewriting code can be constructed by an appropriate encoding from information to lattice points .",
    "an @xmath7-dimensional lattice @xmath8 is defined by an @xmath7-by-@xmath7 generator matrix @xmath9 .",
    "the lattice consists of the discrete set of points @xmath10 for which @xmath11 where @xmath12 is from the set of all possible integer vectors , @xmath13 .",
    "the voronoi region is region of @xmath14 which is closer to @xmath15 than to any other point , and the volume of this region is the determinant of @xmath9 : @xmath16 the @xmath17 entry of @xmath9 is denoted @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a lattice with a diagonal generator matrix .",
    "let @xmath19 be an @xmath7-cube , given by : @xmath20 for @xmath21 , which has volume @xmath22 .",
    "then the codebook of the proposed code is : @xmath23 the lattice generator is lower triangular , and the diagonal entries @xmath24 satisfy the condition that @xmath25 is an integer .    the cube @xmath19 is partitioned into @xmath4 blocks .",
    "the blocks are indexed by @xmath26 , given by : @xmath27 each block @xmath28 is given by the set of @xmath29 such that : @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath32 is an integer , then then each block is an @xmath7-cube with volume @xmath5 .",
    "however , @xmath32 is allowed to be non - integer , in which case some blocks sharing a face with @xmath19 will have volume less than @xmath4 .",
    "the lattice points inside each block form a subcodebook : @xmath33 the size of the full codebook and the maximum size of any subcodebook are @xmath34 respectively .    within each block with volume @xmath4",
    ", there is a one - to - one mapping from information to subcodewords , thus the rate of the code , expressed in information bits per cell is : @xmath35 if @xmath36 is used . also , there is a one - to - many , in particular , a one - to-@xmath4 mapping between information and the full codebook .",
    "the encoding is as follows , and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] for @xmath37 .",
    "a random `` hash '' maps information @xmath38 to hashed sequences @xmath39 .",
    "this hash depends upon @xmath26 : @xmath40 a simple hash is simply to add a constant modulo @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a hash vector for block @xmath44 .",
    "these symbols are then encoded to lattice points as @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the encoding @xmath47 for any block @xmath44 is as follows @xcite . in general",
    ", @xmath48 is not in @xmath28 .",
    "instead , the encoding finds @xmath49 with @xmath50 such that @xmath51 is in the cube @xmath28 .",
    "because the generator matrix is diagonal , the @xmath52 can be found by solving the inequality : @xmath53 for @xmath52 , which is unique .",
    "first @xmath54 , then @xmath55 are found in sequence . in particular : @xmath56 where computation at step @xmath57 depends upon @xmath58 . also , the data range depends on @xmath24 , that is @xmath59 .",
    "now , consider that the current state of the memory is @xmath60 .",
    "given an information sequence @xmath61 , or its hash @xmath62 , there may be many candidate codewords .",
    "for any codeword @xmath15 , all components of @xmath63 must be positive .",
    "let @xmath64 $ ] denote the codeword in @xmath65 corresponding to @xmath61 .",
    "since there is no a priori knowledge about future data sequences , it is reasonable that the codeword choice should maximize the number of codeword points that remain  available \" to future writes , that is , the number of codewords in the positive direction should be maximized .",
    "while it is computationally difficult to count these points , a reasonable approximation is the volume that remains after the point is written .",
    "this argument bears some resemblance to the continuous approximation used in channel coding using lattices @xcite .",
    "in particular , if @xmath15 is to be written , then the remaining volume is : @xmath66 and the encoder should write : @xmath67 ) \\geq { \\mathbf}0 } \\prod_{i=1}^n \\big ( m\\cdot d - x_i\\big ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this maximization is computationally complex as the lattice dimension @xmath7 increases .",
    "generally , however there will be a codeword in a neighboring block .",
    "thus , the search can be performed not over all @xmath44 , but only over those positive neighbors of the block that contains the current state @xmath60 .",
    "this results in complexity proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "decoding is straightforward .",
    "if noise is present , then lattice decoding should be performed , to obtain the estimated lattice point @xmath69 .",
    "the encoded integers are simply @xmath70 , and from these , @xmath71 is obtained as : @xmath72 the information is obtained by reversing the hash function : @xmath73 where @xmath43 is defined as before .     and code rate @xmath74 . ,",
    "in order to make a fair normalization in the absence of noise , the scale of the lattice must be selected .",
    "proper scaling of the lattice for comparison of coding gain is not clear , although previous work on channel coding used a fixed volume of the voronoi region ( see , for example , @xcite ) . for conventional @xmath0-ary rewriting codes",
    ", the rectangular lattice with integer spacing applies ; the volume of the voronoi region of this lattice is 1 .",
    "that is , a scalar @xmath75 is selected such that : latexmath:[\\ ] ] it has a lower - triangular form , and so it is suitable for the proposed construction .",
    "naturally , there is a tradeoff between code rate and the average number of writes , and this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , obtained by computer simulation .",
    "values of @xmath0 were fixed , with @xmath84 .",
    "the code rate @xmath85 , and @xmath32 was allowed to be a non - integer .",
    "the most striking feature is that the number of writes depends strongly upon @xmath0 .",
    "also , while not shown here , it was observed numerically that the average number of writes increased roughly linearly in @xmath32 , much as the minimum number of writes is also linear in @xmath32 .",
    "note that many conventional @xmath0-ary rewriting codes allow rewriting one _ bit _ at a time .",
    "for this lattice - based code , the entire _ word _ is re - written .",
    "this paper has demonstrated that rewriting codes based upon lattices is feasible .",
    "state - of - the - art has flash chips provide digital data to the external interface , but for lattices to be applicable , the analog values should be accessible .",
    "one of the goals of this work is to show the benefits of integrating the analog signal processing and coding in flash memories .",
    "lattices have an inherent error - correction property , and they appear to be suitable for both error correction and rewriting .",
    "in fact , the equal - voronoi - volume assumption substantially favors lattices with regard to error correction , since it is well known that increasing the dimension leads to substantial error - correction coding gain .",
    "a point to note is that the rewriting capability of lattices presented in this paper does not appear to substantially depend upon the dimension @xmath7 .",
    "that is , the minimum number of writes is @xmath32 , and there is a well - defined relationship between @xmath86 , @xmath32 , @xmath0 and @xmath41 .",
    "however , this appears to not be surprising . in 1984 ,",
    "fiat and shamir , working with very general memory models , those based upon directed acyclic graphs ( dag ) , observed :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the significant improvement in memory capability is linear with the dag depth . for a fixed number of states",
    "a `` deep and narrow '' dag cell is always preferable to a `` shallow and wide '' dag cell .",
    "@xcite _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _      the lattice - based construction does have one weakness when the dimension is small . while the conventional @xmath0-ary construction can write the maximum value of @xmath87 in all cells , this is not possible using lattices , and leads to a slight loss of capability . note in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] that there are some lattice points on the boundary which can not be assigned to a subcodebook .",
    "however , this loss can be readily recovered by the superior packing density of lattices , obtained as the dimension increases .",
    "low - density lattices codes are high - dimensional lattices which can approach the asymptotic bounds for _ coding _ gain @xcite .",
