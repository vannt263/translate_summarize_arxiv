    "the problem of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe is one of the major mysteries of cosmology , astrophysics and particle physics . according to the planck satellite observations , and based on the standard model of cosmology , the total mass - energy of the known universe contains 4.8% ordinary matter , 26.1% dark matter and 69.1% dark energy ( planck collaboration 2013 ) .    the first indication of the existence of dark matter ( dm ) came from jeans ( 1922 ) analysis of the vertical motions of stars near the plane of the milky way .",
    "zwicky ( 1933 ) measured radial velocities of galaxies in the coma cluster and concluded that it must contain a large amount of dark matter to hold galaxies together .",
    "many other observations have indicated the existence of dark matter , including the rotation curves of galaxies , gravitational lensing of background objects by galaxy clusters , and the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "so far , the most direct observational evidence for dark matter is the bullet cluster , where a collision between two galaxy clusters have caused a separation of dark matter and ordinary matter .",
    "x - ray observations show that much of the hot gas has been slowed down by ram pressure and settled near the point of impact .",
    "however , weak gravitational lensing observations show that much of the mass is distributed outside of the central region .",
    "because dark matter does not interact by electromagnetic forces , the dm halos of the two clusters would have passed through each other without slowing down substantially ( clowe et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "all the found evidences for dm come from its gravitational effects .",
    "so far , searches for explicit signals of dm particles have been giving negative results .",
    "indirect detection aim to find signals of the annihilations of dm particles in the fluxes of cosmic rays .",
    "usually , the searches consist in looking for channels and ranges of energy where it is possible to overcome the background from ordinary astrophysical processes .",
    "weniger ( 2012 ) have found tentative evidence for a line spectral feature at @xmath0 gev in the fermi - lat data .",
    "it can be explained by @xmath2 gev dark matter annihilating into two photons with a cross section approximately 24 times smaller than that needed for the thermal relic density .",
    "afterwards , the signal was independently confirmed ( tempel & hektor & raidal 2012 ; su & finkbeiner 2012a ; hektor & raidal & tempel 2012b ) .",
    "in some analysis , another line at @xmath3 gev is observed ( su & finkbeiner 2012b ) . the double peak at 110 gev and 130 gev was also observed in the gamma - ray excess from eighteen nearby galaxy clusters ( hektor & raidal & tempel 2012a ) .",
    "this feature is a generic prediction of dm annihilation , corresponding to @xmath4 and @xmath5 final states .",
    "the fact that the signals from the galactic center ( gc ) and from galaxy clusters give excesses that precisely coincide suggests that this is not a statistical fluctuation .",
    "profumo & linden ( 2012 ) have suggested that the signal has an astrophysical origin associated with the fermi bubble regions , but tempel et al .",
    "( 2012 ) claims that the strongest emission is coming from close to the galactic center and not from the fermi bubbles regions .",
    "aharonian , khangulyan & malyshev ( 2012 ) proposed that ultrarelativistic pulsar winds could be the source of the gamma - ray line .",
    "the possibility that the gamma - ray line is a fake instrumental effect is disfavored , as discussed in ( finkbeiner , su & weniger 2012 ) and ( hektor et al .",
    "2012b ) .",
    "the signal was confirmed by the fermi - lat collaboration . using reprocessed data ,",
    "the feature shifted to 133 gev and lost statistical signicance ( fermi - lat collaboration 2013 ) .",
    "more data are needed to clarify its origin .",
    "we adopt the annihilating dm hypothesis and analyze if a fermionic dark matter could account for it .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we present the wimp paradigm . in sec . 3",
    ", we report the gamma - ray line detected in the fermi - lat data . in sec . 4 , we review a fermionic dark matter model . in sec .",
    "4 we study the constraint imposed by the observed dm relic density . in sec .",
    "6 , we calculate the annihilation into two photons . in sec . 7 , we show the results and discussions , introducing a modification in the model .",
    "finally , we give our conclusion in sec .",
    "several generic classes of dm candidates have been suggested and the most widely accepted is weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "the interest in this approach comes from the fact that wimps in thermal equilibrium in the early universe naturally give the right abundance to be cold dark matter .",
    "furthermore , these same interactions make the detection of wimps possible .",
    "it is assumed that in the early universe wimps were produced and annihilated in particle - antiparticle collisions , such as @xmath6    at temperatures much higher than the wimp mass , the colliding particle - antiparticle pair in the thermal plasma had enough energy to create wimp pairs efficiently .",
    "the annihilation reactions of wimps into standard model ( sm ) particles were initially in equilibrium with the production processes",
    ".    as the universe expanded , the temperature of the plasma dropped below the wimp mass . while maintaining equilibrium , the number of wimps produced decreased exponentially as @xmath7 .",
    "meanwhile , the expansion of the universe decreased the number density of particles @xmath8 , and with it the production and annihilation rate .",
    "when the wimp annihilation rate became smaller than the expansion rate of the universe , the interactions of wimps froze out and their number density in a comoving volume remained approximately constant .",
    "the relic density of wimps is approximately @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section at freeze - out .",
    "the most precise measurement of the relic density has been obtained from the planck satellite data as @xmath11 ( ade et al .",
    "2013 ) , where @xmath12 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath13 . from eq .",
    "( [ miracle ] ) , we see that weak scale particles give the right relic density .",
    "this fact is known as the wimp miracle .",
    "the gamma - ray flux produced by the annihilation of self - conjugated dm particles @xmath14 ( e.g. majorana fermions ) into two photons inside the galactic dm halo is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the angle between the direction of the line of sight and the axis connecting the earth to the gc . here",
    ", @xmath17 is the dm mass , @xmath18 the thermally averaged cross section for @xmath19 , @xmath20 the gamma - ray line energy and @xmath21 the dm distribution as function of the distance from the gc .",
    "the coordinate @xmath22 runs along the line of sight and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the distance between the sun and the gc .",
    "if dm is not constituted by self - conjugated particles ( e.g. dirac fermions ) , the equation ( [ fluxo ] ) has to be divided by a factor of 2 if only particle - antiparticle annihilations are present .",
    "weniger ( 2012 ) analyzed 43 months of data ( from 4 aug 2008 to 8 mar 2012 ) with energies between 1 and 300 gev . in regions close to the gc",
    ", it was found a 4.6@xmath25 indication for a gamma - ray line at @xmath0 gev .",
    "considering the look - elsewhere effect , the significance of the observed excess is 3.2@xmath25 .",
    "this spectral feature can be interpreted in terms of dm particles annihilating into two photons .",
