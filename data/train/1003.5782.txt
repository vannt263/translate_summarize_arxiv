    "the following conjectures are due to seymour @xcite .",

    "conjecture [ seymourperfects ] was first formulated by berge , fulkerson for @xmath14 ( berge fulkerson conjecture ) .",

    "berge , fulkerson and of fan , raspaud , the following statement seems to be a natural generalization of conjecture [ fanraspaud ] .",
    "[ fanraspaud_r ] for @xmath18 , any @xmath0-graph contains @xmath0 perfect matchings such that the intersection of any three of them is empty .",
    "as the berge , fulkerson conjecture implies conjecture [ fanraspaud ] , conjecture [ seymourperfects ] implies conjecture [ fanraspaud_r ] . this paper studies the structure of minimum counter example to conjectures [ seymourcoloring ] and [ seymourperfects ] , and a variation of [ fanraspaud_r ] .    a graph @xmath3 is matching covered if every edge belongs to a perfect matching .",
    "it is factor - critical if @xmath19 has a perfect matching for every vertex @xmath20 , and it is bi - critical if @xmath21 has a perfect matching for every pair of vertices @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "a barrier in a matching covered graph is a set @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .",
    "note that a single vertex in a matching covered graph is a barrier .",
    "a non - bipartite , bi - critical and @xmath15-vertex - connected graph is a brick .",
    "this paper proves that a minimal counter example to conjectures [ seymourcoloring ] and [ seymourperfects ] is a brick .",
    "there are almost no results on these conjectures , and one might think about some variations of the original conjectures .",
    "it is a natural question whether a perfect matching can be fixed in conjectures [ seymourperfects ] or [ fanraspaud ] , say : let @xmath6 be an @xmath0-graph ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 a perfect matching of @xmath6 , then @xmath6 has @xmath27 perfect matchings @xmath28 such that for any @xmath29 the intersection @xmath30 is empty .",
    "we will show that this this is not true for any odd @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath3 be an @xmath0-graph .",
    "an odd set @xmath23 with @xmath31 is non - trivial , if @xmath32 .",
    "we start with the following theorem",
    ".        clearly , an @xmath0-graph is matching covered ( see exercise 3.4.4 in @xcite p. 113 ) , and let @xmath33 be any maximal barrier with @xmath34 .",
    "then , @xmath35 has @xmath36 componets @xmath37 , which are factor - critical ( see lemma 4.6 .",
    "in @xcite p. 198 ) .",
    "since @xmath37 are odd , it follows that @xmath38 , for @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",
    "the set @xmath33 can receive at most @xmath40 edges , thus @xmath33 is an independent set and @xmath41 , for @xmath39 .",
    "case 1 : there is a maximal barrier @xmath33 with @xmath42 . if the components of @xmath35 are isolated vertices , then @xmath6 is bipartite and hence ( 1 ) .",
    "if there is a component @xmath43 of @xmath35 , that is not an isolated vertex , then @xmath41 and @xmath6 satisfies the condition ( 2 ) of the theorem .",
    "case 2 : for any maximal barrier @xmath33 , we have @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is factor - critical , which means that for any vertex @xmath22 , the graph @xmath21 has a perfect matching , thus @xmath6 satisfies the condition ( 3 ) .",
    "@xmath47        suppose that there is one and let @xmath49 be the vertices of the @xmath48-cut .",
    "since @xmath6 is bi - critical , the graph @xmath21 has a perfect matching , thus all connected components @xmath37 of @xmath21 are even .",
    "let @xmath50 denote the number of edges of @xmath6 that connect the vertices @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath39 let @xmath51 and @xmath52 be the number of edges that connects @xmath20 and @xmath22 to @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath53        let @xmath6 be a minimum counter - example to conjecture [ seymourcoloring ] .",
    "since bipartite @xmath0-regular graphs are @xmath0-edge - colorable , @xmath6 is not bipartite .",
    "next , we show that there is no non - trivial odd @xmath9 , such that @xmath31 .",
    "suppose that there is one .",
    "then consider the two graphs @xmath62 and @xmath63 that are obtained from @xmath6 by contracting @xmath12 and @xmath64 to a vertex , respectively .",
    "clearly @xmath62 and @xmath63 are @xmath0-graphs ; moreover since they are smaller than @xmath6 , they are @xmath13-edge - colorable .",
    "now , it is not hard to see that an @xmath13-edge - coloring of @xmath6 can be obtained from those of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which would contradict the choice of @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath73 @xmath74 be an odd number and @xmath75 an unslicable @xmath0-graph .",
    "let @xmath76 be a ( multi- ) cycle of length @xmath0 , where every edge has multiplicity @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath76 is @xmath69-regular .",
    "replace every vertex @xmath22 of @xmath75 by a copy @xmath77 of @xmath76 to obtain a @xmath68-regular graph @xmath78 .",
    "note that the _ old _ edges of @xmath75 in @xmath6 form a perfect matching @xmath26 of @xmath6 .",
    "we first show that @xmath6 is an @xmath68-graph .",
    "clearly @xmath79 is even .",
    "let @xmath23 be an odd set and assume that @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath81 contains an edge of a cycle @xmath77 , then it contains at least @xmath69 of them , i.e. @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that @xmath22 is a cut vertex in @xmath75 , contradicting the fact that @xmath75 is 2-vertex - connected .",
    "thus @xmath81 contains at least one old edge of @xmath75 and hence @xmath83 , contradicting our assumption .",
    "thus we may assume that @xmath81 contains only old edges of @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath84 be the subset of @xmath6 from which @xmath12 is obtained in the transfornmation from @xmath75 to @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath12 is an odd set in @xmath6 and hence @xmath84 is an odd set in @xmath75 .",
    "but then @xmath85 , contradicting the fact that @xmath75 is an @xmath0-graph .",
    "thus @xmath6 is a @xmath68-graph .",
    "now assume that @xmath6 has @xmath27 perfect matchings @xmath86 such that @xmath87 , for any @xmath29 .",
    "consider @xmath88 .",
    "since it is an odd cut , it follows that @xmath89 , for @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore @xmath91 by the choice of @xmath26 .",
    "if there is a perfect matching , say @xmath92 such that @xmath93 , then , since we assume that @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , the remaining @xmath96 perfect matching @xmath97 share @xmath98 edges .",
    "thus there are @xmath99 , such that the intersection of @xmath26 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is not empty .",
    "thus every perfect matching of @xmath102 contains precisely one edge of @xmath88 , and they are pairwise disjoint on @xmath88 . but",
    "this implies that they induce @xmath27 pairwise disjoint perfect matchings @xmath103 on @xmath75 .",
    "thus @xmath75 contains an @xmath27-graph , contradicting the fact that @xmath75 is unslicable ."
