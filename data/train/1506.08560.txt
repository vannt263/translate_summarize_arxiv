    "luminous early - type galaxies ( @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath520.5 @xmath6 0.75  mag ) typically possess a core that is partially depleted of stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this is evident by a marked flattening of their inner light distribution @xcite .",
    "the light profiles of these bright galaxies typically have a negative , inner logarithmic slope @xmath40.3 , and have been fit using the king model @xcite , the `` nuker law '' @xcite , and the core - srsic model @xcite .",
    "the nuker model was designed to investigate the inner - most regions of nearby early - type galaxies , and its double power - law nature was never intended to adapt to the full , outer , intrinsically curved @xmath7like profiles of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* their section 2 ) .",
    "the outer @xmath7 curvature in galaxies results in a profile whose slope changes as a function of radius . as a consequence , the slope of a fitted nuker model s outer power law ( @xmath8 ) varies with the fitted radial extent of a galaxy . due to parameter coupling , it follows that all of the nuker model parameters are a function of the fitted radial extent ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figures 24 ) .",
    "the coupling is such that the nuker model `` break radii '' are heavily over - estimated , relative to the radius of maximum curvature in the actual profile , i.e. the `` break '' , and increasingly so as the fitted radial extent is increased @xcite .",
    "this contributed to @xcite adopting the radius where the nuker model has a negative logarithmic slope of @xmath2 equal to 0.5 @xcite as a measure of the core size .",
    "all galaxy light profiles , even those with no depleted cores , have a radius where @xmath2 equals 0.5 .    in @xcite it was shown how a nuker model ( with an inner power - law slope @xmath90.3 ) can approximate a srsic profile ( without any depleted core ) if the profile has a low srsic index and thus a shallow inner profile slope .",
    "@xcite showed that this has occurred when modelling several real galaxies .",
    "most recently , for example , @xcite report that their atlas@xmath10 galaxy ngc  4473 is a core galaxy according to their nuker model fit .",
    "however , it actually contains an additional nuclear component rather than a depleted core @xcite , which @xcite have shown through the use of the srsic and core - srsic models .",
    "the core - sersic model was introduced , in part , to prevent confusion when a profile has a shallow inner slope but no central deficit of stars , and to provide more robust , physically meaningful radii , slopes , and flux deficits for partially depleted cores .",
    "core sizes , as measured by the break radii of the core - srsic model ( @xmath11 ) , are typically tens to a few hundred parsecs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these core - srsic break radii are where the core - srsic model has its maximum curvature , and , for galaxies with depleted cores , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their section 5.2 ) revealed that this also matches well with the cusp radius is defined as the radius at which the negative logarithmic slope of the intensity profile @xmath2 equals a pre - specified value @xcite .",
    "hereafter we will use @xmath12 to actually indicate @xmath13 . [",
    "footnote : r_gamma ] ] @xmath14 where the negative logarithmic slope of the projected light profile equals 0.5 .",
    "as noted , galaxies without partially depleted cores can also possess such a radius , and therefore one still needs to establish if there is an inner deficit relative to the outer profile . indeed , many galaxies have an inner profile slope shallower than 0.5 , and 0.3 , but do not have a partially depleted core ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* their appendix a.2 ) .",
    "a thorough review of galaxy light profiles can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the most accredited scenarios for core formation attributes the depletion to the scouring action of black hole ( bh ) binaries formed during dry galaxy merger events .",
    "the binary depletes the centre of a galaxy by ejecting stars via three - body interactions which result in the orbital decay of the binary ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested that the stellar mass depleted via the binary bh scouring mechanism scales as 0.5@xmath15@xmath16 , where @xmath15 is the effective number of major dry mergers which the galaxy experienced .",
    "however , the observational result that @xmath17 is typically 0.54 @xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implies that the core galaxies characterized by the larger @xmath17/@xmath16 ratio should have experienced up to 8 major dry mergers .",
    "such a number of major mergers near or above this figure is excessive if compared to the merger rates derived from the observation of close massive galaxy pairs in the local ( @xmath18 @xmath9 0.8 ) universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a second mistery is that @xcite have revealed that the large bulges with over - massive bhs ( or low velocity dispersions ) in the @xmath16@xmath19 diagram do not have larger @xmath17/@xmath16 ratios as expected from dry mergers and as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the depleted core radius is indicative of the central mass depletion experienced by the galaxy , modulo the pre - existing central stellar density profile .",
    "scaling relations exist between the final merged mass ( @xmath16 ) of the central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) and both the ejected stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and the core radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies have described the @xmath16(core radius ) correlation using a log - linear relation , albeit with large uncertainties due to significant scatter in the data .",
    "the ongoing effort to characterize the high mass end of the relations is necessary to investigate whether a single slope is appropriate to describe the @xmath16@xmath11 diagram , as is currently assumed in the range 10@xmath20 @xmath4 @xmath16/@xmath21 @xmath4 10@xmath22 .",
    "a bend in the @xmath16@xmath11 relation may , for example , indicate different regimes of efficiency for the bh scouring mechanism .",
    "for instance , @xcite have suggested that multiple ( i.e. , more than 2 ) smbh systems can significantly increase the effectiveness of the scouring activity , and generate cores with a mass deficit up to five times @xmath16 .",
    "a non - linear relation may also indicate that additional mechanisms other than binary bh scouring are operating .",
    "for example , a `` kicked '' smbh can create an enhanced depleted core by crossing the nucleus multiple times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the smbh is placed on a radial orbit , intersecting with the nucleus , after the recoil acquired upon its creation from the coalescence of a specially - oriented bh binary .",
    "such a recoil is generated in response to the linear momentum carried away by the anisotropic emission of gravitational waves .",
    "another possibility for creating large cores is the `` stalled binary '' model @xcite , which proposes that the scouring activity is performed by a captured in - falling object . in this picture ,",
    "a `` perturber '' spirals towards a galaxian center due to dynamical friction .",
    "the `` stalled binary '' scenario of @xcite predicts core radii up to @xmath233  kpc and @xmath17 scaling as the mass of the perturber . in doing so",
    ", it exerts a tidal action on the central mass distribution , shredding it and creating a partially depleted core .",
    "this model predicts that the core radius will correspond to the orbit at which the infall of the perturber stalls due to a reduced efficiency of the dynamical friction . in yet another scenario",
    ", @xcite argued that the feedback action of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) might be an important factor in the creation of cores .",
    "the agn feedback models by @xcite easily produce core radii of sizes up to @xmath2310  kpc although not yet confirmed . in this model ,",
    "agn - driven gas outflows generate fluctuations in the gravitational potential of the central region , from which stars are removed during the subsequent re - virialization and adjustment process .",
    "the expulsion of gas from the inner region might also induce an adiabatic expansion of the central stellar distribution , hence flattening the central mass density profile .",
    "based on the extrapolation of the relation between the luminosity of the host spheroid ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are expected to host extremely massive bhs ( @xmath16 @xmath25 10@xmath22  @xmath21 ) .",
    "recent n - body simulations including the effects of dark matter , black holes , as well as baryons , have shown that black hole scouring in bcgs can create cores as large as 3  kpc @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of bcgs is important to explore the scarcely - populated high - mass end of the @xmath16@xmath11 diagram , and hence provide better constraints on the @xmath16@xmath11 scaling relation and the formation physics involved .",

    "the cusp radius of holm  15a is not only more than three times larger than the average @xmath12 obtained by @xcite using the nuker model for their sub - sample of @xmath2360 bcgs , but is also significantly larger than the biggest recorded core - srsic model break radius ( @xmath11 @xmath23 1.5  kpc ) reported by @xcite for the massive elliptical galaxy sdss j091944.2 + 562201.1 .",
    "lc14 derived @xmath12 fitting a 2d nuker model to an image of holm  15a within a major - axis radius of @xmath2380  kpc .",
    "they confirmed their measurement of @xmath12 non - parametrically from the 1d radial light profile ( i.e. , applying the definition given in footnote [ footnote : r_gamma ] ) .",

    "this unconventional light deficit was then used to derive a bh mass using the @xmath29@xmath16 relation of @xcite , giving an exceptionally high @xmath16 @xmath23 10@xmath31  @xmath21 .",
    "lc14 assessed the viability of this value by comparing it against the value of @xmath16 estimated using other methods . since no direct ( dynamical ) measurement of the mass of the smbh of holm  15a is available",

    "is the exceptionally large core of holm  15a really due to a deficit of light relative to the inward extrapolation of its outer light profile ?",
    "is there an obvious and dramatic downward bend to its inner light profile ? we have further investigated the case of holm  15a by performing a detailed analysis of the light distribution of the galaxy .",
    "for the first time , we apply the core - srsic model and check if a depleted core is warranted over a core-_less _ model ( i.e.  a srsic model ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in  [ data ] , we present the data and the procedure used for modeling the 1d light profile and the 2d image of the galaxy . in  [ discussion ] we show that the light in holm  15a is well fit by a three - parameter srsic function plus an exponential `` halo '' and as such it does not appear to have a partially depleted core with a well - defined break in the light profile .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we have used an @xmath32-band.mp9601 filter .",
    "this band corresponds to the sdss @xmath32-band , to which we will refer hereafter .",
    "[ footnote : filter ] ] image from the wide - field megaprime camera mounted on the canadian - french - hawaiian - telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the image was retrieved from the canadian astronomy data center ] ( cadc ) .",
    "this enabled us to make a direct comparison with lc14 , who used kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) and cfht data , in the @xmath33 and @xmath32 bands , respectively .",
    "we have based our analysis on the cfht data because  to our knowledge  they represent the publicly available images for holm  15a with the best seeing quality .",
    "a narrow point spread function ( psf ) is important to detect core structures , whose projected sizes , even in the closest galaxies , are of the order of a few arcseconds or less .",
    "the detector of the cfht megaprime camera is composed of 36 ccds ( 2112@xmath344644 pixels each ) covering a sky area of @xmath231 square degree . every megaprime image in the cadc",
    "is reduced via the elixir pipeline @xcite , which performs the basic data calibration , including bias subtraction , flat - fielding , de - fringing , and astrometric calibration .",
    "the cfht data used by lc14 was a single 120  s exposure .",
    "we searched the cadc archive for a similar data set , and discovered that all the images were severely affected by scattered light .",
    "this scattered light , which appears as a diffuse radial gradient across the image , is known to plague the megaprime data and it is due to unwanted internal reflections through the optics .",
    "this wavelength - dependent issue , especially prominent in the @xmath32-band , was extensively reviewed by @xcite .",
    "due to the lack of an analytical description for the scattered light , it could not be readily disentangled from the smoother sky background .",
    "we therefore modeled the combined background ( sky + scattered light ) , and subtracted the contribution from the two components at the same time .",
    "since holm  15a easily fits within one single megaprime ccd , still allowing ample margins to determine the background , we performed this operation and the other analyses only on the ccd which was centered on the galaxy .",
    "first , we ran sextractor @xcite to determine the @xmath35 ( i.e.  the radius encompassing 90% of the flux ) of each source in the image , and to obtain a median estimate of the remaining background flux and of the background root - mean - square ( rms ) fluctuation .",
    "each detected source was masked using an elliptical region with a major axis equal to twice the size of the @xmath35 of the source , and with axis ratio and position angle ( p.a . ) as determined by sextractor ; in addition , we masked any 5@xmath19 fluctuation about the median background flux .",
    "finally , we used galfit @xcite to fit a 2d gradient to the background , adopting the sextractor median background as the initial guess for the value at the image center .",

    "the right panel of figure [ figure : mosaic_and_mask ] shows the cfht mosaic with the masked areas down - scaled by an arbitrary amount ; we also overplot the elliptical isophotes derived using the iraf._ellipse _ task @xcite .",

    "we observe that beyond @xmath232@xmath41 , the ellipticity is steadily increasing , except for a flattening in the range 10@xmath4130@xmath41 .",
    "increasing ellipticities have been shown to be common for bcgs , and they can be due to the projection of the prolate ( or triaxial ) structure of the outer regions ( typically beyond @xmath2345  kpc ) of these objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "the fitting of models to the light profile ( see  [ the choice of models ] ) have been performed via a levenberg - marquardt minimization procedure , as described in @xcite .",
    "we chose to limit the fit to @xmath42 @xmath9 25.5  mag arcsec@xmath45 ( approximately corresponding to sma @xmath9 90  kpc ) , based on where the residual large scale background gradient ( i.e. , after the background subtraction process described above ) becomes comparable to the galaxy light gradient .",
    "this limit roughly corresponds to the radius at which the elliptical isophotes stop being concentric ( see figure [ figure : mosaic_and_mask ] , right panel ) .",
    "modeling of the 2d light distribution was performed using galfit - corsair ] @xcite , a tool developed to include the core - srsic model into the galfit fitting algorithm .    to maximize the consistency with the 1d analysis",
    ", we restricted the fit within the @xmath42 @xmath23 25.5  mag arcsec@xmath45 isophote ( see  [ the 1d radial light profile ] ) by masking every pixel outside it ( see figure [ figure : mosaic_and_mask ] , right panel ) .",
    "the galfit - corsair mask was hence obtained by combining this filter with the object mask described before .",
    "the psf template was built with psfex @xcite , combining @xmath2320 stars with signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath46 ) @xmath47 100 . since the variation of the psf fwhm was negligible across the ccd ( less than 5% ) , we selected stars from all areas .",
    "the fwhm of the resulting psf model is @xmath230@xmath41.75 , in agreement with the value measured for real stars in the image .",
    "finally , the weight ( `` sigma '' ) image was constructed using the internal galfit algorithm , to which we supplied an estimate of the sky rms as measured on the image by using sextractor .",
    "we warn the reader that the varying ellipticity of holm  15a ( figure [ figure : ellipse ] , top - right panel ) can pose a challenge for the 2d fitting , because in galfit - corsair , as with galfit , each galaxy component is associated with a single ellipticity and position angle . when the components of real galaxies have ellipticity gradients , the model does not allow for this .",
    "that is , even when a galaxy is decomposed into multiple components , the problem might persist whenever the ellipticity profile has a significant gradient over the range where any single component dominates .",
    "this issue is of no concern when modeling the 1d profile , which is simply extracted along the major axis . as such",
    ", small discrepancies are expected between the 1d and 2d analyses .      to investigate the presence of a partially depleted core in holm  15a",
    ", we separately fit a seeing - convolved srsic model and a seeing - convolved core - srsic model , in both 1d and 2d .",
    "as noted and modelled by lc14 , holm  15a has a halo of light around it .",
    "the `` bump '' in the radial light profile at around 35  kpc , which also corresponds to a step in the ellipticity profile ( see figure [ figure : ellipse ] ) , does indeed suggest that the galaxy hosts a second component .",
    "we therefore added an outer [ seeing - convolved ] exponential function to the srsic / core - srsic `` bulge '' , capturing the `` halo '' of intra - cluster light ( icl ) .",
    "an exponential halo model was used following @xcite , who revealed that the halos of bcgs are typically exponential ; see also @xcite .",
    "we did additionally model the icl with a srsic @xmath7 model , but we found that it yielded a srsic index of @xmath231 , i.e. an exponential model .",
    "the best - fit parameters obtained for the aforementioned models are reported in table [ table : fit ] , while the model profiles are represented in figure [ figure : fit_1d ] ( 1d fit ) and in the left and central panels of figure [ figure : fit_2d ] ( 2d fit ) .",
    "we stress that the profiles shown in figure [ figure : fit_2d ] represent a 1d _ projection _ of the 2d images and 2d models rather than what was actually minimized , namely the difference between the 2d image and model , as shown in lower panels of figure [ figure : fit_2d ] .",
    "this projection was performed measuring the surface brightness of these images along the isophotes identified with iraf._ellipse _ in our 1d analysis ( see  [ the 1d radial light profile ] ) . in the next section",
    ", we will first mention the small discrepancies between the results of the 1d and 2d modeling , and then proceed to discuss the selection of the best - fit model .",
    "overall , our results from the modeling of the 1d light profile and the 2d image agree very well ( see table [ table : fit ] ) .",
    "however , the 1d projection of the 2d residuals ( figure [ figure : fit_2d ] ) show a more pronounced pattern than seen the 1d residuals ( figure [ figure : fit_1d ] ) .",
    "this is partly an artifact of the particular choice of projection , and partly a direct consequence of each 2d model component of galfit - corsair having a single center and ellipticity weighted over the whole extent of the fit area . here",

    "indeed , lc14 found evidence for agn emission in the optical spectrum of holm  15a , which might be visible in our @xmath32-band image .",
    "we tried to model this potential inner feature by adding a point - source to the 2d models ( nominally , a psf function ) , but we could not obtain a successful fit due to the low surface brightness of this potential component relative to the surrounding galaxy .",

    "assuming that the 10@xmath4130@xmath41 interval marks the transition between them , our 2d fit seems to recover the ellipticity at the outer edge of each component ( see table [ table : fit ] ) , most probably due to the higher number of pixels along larger isophotes . the single ellipticity of the galfit - corsair components is the cause for the pattern visible in the center of the residual image ( figure [ figure : fit_2d ] , bottom - left ) , which appears as a 1@xmath41 - 4@xmath41 structure oriented in the direction perpendicular to the galaxian major - axis ( i.e. , along the ne - sw direction ) .",
    "this happens because in that region the image isophotes have a much more circular shape ( @xmath48__e__@xmath49 @xmath23 0.1 ) than the 2d srsic component ( for which we obtained @xmath43 = 0.2 ) . in the 1d projection of the 2d residuals ( figure [ figure : fit_2d ] , top - left ) , this pattern manifests as a sinusoidal feature .    as a consequence ,",

    "every core - srsic fit can effectively reproduce an intrinsic srsic profile by sufficiently minimizing the break radius of the core .",
    "although a core is partially resolved in the 2d model ( middle panels of figure [ figure : fit_2d ] ) , it does not seem to improve the fit significantly .",
    "in particular , we observe that the 1@xmath414@xmath41 2d residual feature described above is still present , and  although slightly reduced  still shows the same pattern , hence reducing the likelihood that it is related to a depleted a core .",
    "on the other hand , outside the problematic inner @xmath230@xmath41.5 region , the srsic+exponential and core - srsic+exponential models fit the data comparably well , yielding similar residuals ( see table [ table : fit ] and figures [ figure : fit_1d ] and [ figure : fit_2d ] ) .",
    "what has occurred is that the core - srsic core parameters were driven by the fit algorithms to partially compensate for the effects of the @xmath230@xmath41.5 `` excess '' ( 1d case ) or the varying ellipticity ( 2d case ) , rather than accounting for an actual depleted core",

    "this picture is supported by numerical simulations , which showed that bcgs , being at the centers of large dark matter haloes , underwent a vigorous history of both minor and major merging ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and hence may be surrounded by a halo of tidally stripped stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* herafter dm11 ) had already reported that a srsic+exponential model fits the light profile of holm  15a .",
    "we improve on this by : ( _ 1 _ ) investigating the presence of a depleted core ( dm11 did not perform this test plus their data had a fwhm @xmath23 1@xmath412@xmath41 and their fits were limited to a minimum radius of 1.5@xmath34fwhm ) ; and ( _ 2 _ ) reaching deeper in limiting surface brightness ( @xmath2325.5  mag arcsec@xmath45 compared to their 24.5  mag arcsec@xmath45 ) .",
    "dm11 thus limited their analysis to @xmath2360@xmath41 , while our fit extends up to @xmath2380@xmath41 , hence providing a better constraint on the extended galaxy halo light .",
    "our 1d srsic+exponential fit agrees well with the similar fit by dm11 .",
    "given the luminosity@xmath1 relation and the findings in @xcite , it may be surprising to note that the srsic index that we derive for the main `` bulge '' of a bright galaxy like holm  15a ( @xmath51 @xmath23 23.8  mag ) is so small ( @xmath1 @xmath23 1 ) .",
    "however , this low srsic index can be compared to the low srsic indexes measured for the inner components of several bcgs ( e.g.  dm11 ) , as well as in a couple of cd galaxies ( ngc  4874 and ugc  9799 ; * ? ? ?",
    "these low srsic indexes might be a result of a dramatic galaxy re - shaping due to one / some of the processes mentioned in the introduction . although these low-@xmath1 profiles have rather flat inner regions , we are not dealing with a profile that displays a clear break and downward deviation at small radii  as observed with the traditional partially depleted cores in galaxies with larger ( @xmath1 @xmath25 3 ) srsic indexes .",

    "all the surface brightness profiles are expressed relative to the r - band , and , when necessary , have been converted from the observed bands using the colour conversions by @xcite .",

    "we can compare this value with the total magnitude obtained from our 2d srsic+exponential model , before rest - frame and extinction correction (; see table [ table : fit ] and table notes ) .",
    "we converted our magnitude , defined in the sdss @xmath32-band ( ab system ) , to the johnson / cousin @xmath52-band magnitude in the vegamag system ( @xmath53 ) by applying a color correction , as typical for early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath53 = 13.24  mag , comparable to the measurement of lc14 .",
    "an overview on how we came to believe in massive black holes , and the development of the scaling relations associated with them , can be found in the extensive review by @xcite . lc14",
    "estimated the mass of the bh in holm  15a using several scaling relations ( their table 2 ) , and concluded that the best estimate for @xmath16 is . of the relations they used , the only one which directly connects to the assumed morphological profile was the @xmath16@xmath11 relation taken from @xcite , from which they obtained @xmath16 @xmath23 1.7@xmath3410@xmath31@xmath21 using their nuker law break radius",
    "this is an order of magnitude above their preferred estimate .",
    "the @xcite scaling relation was however constructed using the core - srsic break radius ( @xmath54 ) , which is smaller than the nuker break radius ( @xmath55 ) for the reasons discussed in the introduction .",
    "however , we found no convincing evidence in holm  15a for a depleted core relative to the inward extrapolation of the outer light profile and as such we do not deem it appropriate to use the @xmath16@xmath11 relation .    in the binary black hole scouring scenario , the core mass deficit relates to the mass of the final merged smbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the `` depleted '' mass can be inferred from the luminosity deficit with respect to a model representing the `` unperturbed '' galaxy . in lc14",
    ", they use a de vaucouleurs profile as their original , unperturbed model to compare against their double - srsic fit . from a visual inspection ,",
    "their de vaucouleurs profile matches the data over the range of galactocentric radii : 1040 kpc ( lc14 ; their figure 2 ) .",
    "however , given that galaxies and bcgs exhibit a variety of srsic indexes ( e.g.  dm11 ) , it might not be that the original ( i.e. , pre - depletion ) profile of the galaxy had @xmath1 = 4 ( corresponding to a de vaucouleurs profile ) .",
    "indeed , the application of a de vaucouleurs model appears to have produced an artificial over - sized luminosity deficit .    the discrepancies between our results and those of lc14 are related to the adopted paradigm for the description of the surface brightness distribution , i.e.  the core - srsic or the nuker framework .",
    "there is no formal mistake in the analysis of lc14 , and in fact we were able to reproduce their nuker parameters when fitting a nuker model in 2d with galfit .",
    "however , for the reasons highlighted in the introduction  and especially for its ability to discern real cores from the flat inner slopes of low-@xmath1 srsic profiles  we favor the core - srsic model , which found no evidence for a depleted core larger than the resolution limit .",
    "finally , we remark that the depletion of stars from the core of a galaxy due to coalescing black holes , and other mechanisms , preferentially removes stars on radial orbits , leaving an excess of stars on tangential orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "integral - field kinematic data may therefore be of benefit to help identify or reject the presence of a core depleted of stars .",
    "we performed a surface brightness analysis of the bcg holm  15a using a cfht - megaprime @xmath32-band image to investigate the claim that this galaxy has the largest depleted core ever detected ( 4.57  kpc ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we fit the 1d light profile and the 2d image of holm  15a to compare a core-_less _ galaxy plus envelope model ( srsic+exponential ) against a core - srsic galaxy plus envelope model ( core - srsic+exponential ) .",
    "we obtained good agreement among the best - fit parameters derived with the 1d and 2d methods ( see table [ table : fit ] ) , modulo some minor differences predominantly attributable to ellipticity gradients (  [ fit comparison and choice of best - fit model ] ) and a varying center with isophotal radius . in order to approximate the varying ellipticity of the inner galaxy , the 2d models  having components with fixed ellipticity  required the addition of a `` corrective '' component to the srsic+exponential model .",
    "we find that the core - srsic model does not provide an appropriate representation of the galaxy light distribution .",
    "in particular , in the 1d description the core has a slight excess of light , while in the 2d model the inner power - law of the core - srsic fit does not represent an actual real core , but rather compensates for the ellipticity gradient (  [ fit comparison and choice of best - fit model ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the galaxy is core-_less _ and we favor the idea that its light distribution is best described by a simple srsic profile with a low index @xmath1 plus an exponential `` halo '' component as included by lc14 .",
