    "we consider a macroscopic model of self - driven particles which describes the dynamics of a large number of social interactive agents . more specifically",
    ", we are interested in modeling short range repulsion effects due to the fact that finite - size agents ( e.g. sheep in a herd ) can not overlap ( non - overlapping or steric constraints ) . to this aim",
    ", we derive a hyperbolic problem with a density constraint as a limit of an unconstrained system with a repulsive force which turns on suddenly when the density becomes close to the maximal one .",
    "the limit model requires transmission conditions at the transition between an unclustered region ( where the maximal density is not reached ) and a clustered region . in unclustered regions ,",
    "the fluid is compressible while it becomes incompressible in the clustered ones .",
    "therefore , this paper aims at providing a description of this transition between a compressible and an incompressible fluid .",
    "unfortunately , the formal perturbative approach which we implement does not directly provide information about these transmission conditions . in order to retrieve this information",
    ", we rigorously analyze special solutions of the perturbation problem : the riemann problem .",
    "these solutions are explicitely known and allow us to carry out the limit rigorously and to recover the required transmission conditions .",
    "we postulate that these conditions , which are rigorously proven only for riemann problem solutions , do extend to all solutions . however , being non - rigorous for general solutions , these conditions are stated as formal conditions in the `` formal statement 1 '' below , which constitutes the main result of the present paper . still ,",
    "the rigorous analysis of riemann problem solutions is quite technical and the proofs of many statements are deferred to appendices .",
    "the modeling of biological systems undergoing flocking or herding dynamics has been the subject of a vast literature .",
    "a first class of models relies on the alignement interaction between neighbouring self - propelled particles .",
    "the simplest of these models is an individual - based ( or microscopic ) model proposed by vicsek @xcite .",
    "a macroscopic version of the vicsek model is derived in @xcite and a collisional vicsek model is proposed in @xcite .",
    "a variant of the vicsek model has been proposed by cucker and smale @xcite ( see also @xcite for recent mathematical results ) . by incorporating long - range attractive and short - range repulsive forces to the vicsek model ,",
    "one obtains the three zones model of aoki @xcite , originally devised to describe fish schools .",
    "models with repulsive - attractive interaction only ( without alignement interaction ) have been studied in @xcite .",
    "such models have been used for pedestrian interactions @xcite .",
    "other kinds of macroscopic models of drift - diffusion type have been analyzed in @xcite and different hyperbolic models are compared in @xcite . for biological reviews , we can refer to @xcite .",
    "as outlined above , we focus here on the congestion constraint : animals or individuals can not overlap ( steric constraint ) . as a consequence this congestion constraint leads to the existence of a maximal density @xmath0 , which can not be exceeded inside the flock .",
    "this problem has been analyzed before and schematically two methods have been proposed .",
    "a first one consists in modeling repulsion through forces or diffusion terms @xcite .",
    "however , in this approach , the individuals are point particles and their finite size is not explicitely described .",
    "so the maximal density constraint is not explicitely taken into account . to explicitely take this maximal density constraint inco account , in @xcite",
    ", the authors have developped an alternative approach : the particles are first evolved freely over one time step and then projected towards the `` closest '' admissible non - overlapping configuration .",
    "this leads to non - local interaction between the particles which contradicts the local character of the interactions in most biological systems .",
    "by contrast , we developped a third route inspired by multi - phase flows @xcite and traffic jam modeling @xcite .",
    "the repulsive force is modeled by a nonlinear pressure law @xmath1 which becomes singular as the density approaches the maximal density @xmath0 .",
    "additionnally a small parameter @xmath2 allows to describe the fact that the regularized pressure is very small of order @xmath2 as long as the density @xmath3 is smaller than @xmath0 and turns on suddenly to a finite or even large value when @xmath3 becomes close to @xmath0 . in the limit @xmath4 of this model ,",
    "two distinct phases appear : a pressureless compressible phase which describes free motion in unclustered regions and an incompressible phase which describes the motion inside the clusters .",
    "the major difficulty is to find the transmission conditions between the compressible and incompressible phases .",
    "the present paper is a multi - dimensional extension of the methodology presented in @xcite for multi - phase flows or traffic .",
    "however , an additional difficulty arises due to the non - conservative character of the original hyperbolic model .",
    "indeed , momentum is not a conserved quantity because the particles in the underlying particle system are self - propelled particles which have constant ( in - time ) and uniform ( in - space ) velocities .",
    "therefore , the model which is at the starting point of this paper is a non - conservative hyperbolic system which as such presents an ambiguity in the definition of weak solutions",
    ". we will show that this ambiguity can be partly removed for one - dimensional riemann problem solutions .",
    "we believe that the strategy developped in this paper to analyze congestion effects can apply to other systems such as bacteria populations @xcite , economic systems like supply chains @xcite or physical systems like granular materials @xcite .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the perturbation model and its limit .",
    "we also provide the connection conditions between the compressible and incompressible phases of the limit model , which are the main result of the paper . a remark on collision of clusters",
    "is also formulated . with these informations , we show that the available information is sufficient to provide a well - defined dynamics at least in the case of a single cluster . section 3 is devoted to the study of the one - dimensional riemann problem for the perturbed problem and the limits of its solutions as @xmath4 . as stated above , this analysis provides a strong support for ( but not a proof of ) the postulated transmission conditions at the compressible - incompressible interface which are provided in section 2 . appendix a provides a formal derivation of the initial model from an individual based model with long - range attractive and short - range repulsive interactions , which describes the aggregation of gregarious animals like sheep .",
    "appendices b to e provide proofs of technical lemmas and theorems needed in the analysis of the riemann problem .",
    "our starting point is the following model , written in dimensionless form : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the particle density and @xmath7 is the particle velocity .",
    "the problem is posed on the 2-dimensional plane @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the time .",
    "the velocity @xmath10 is supposed to satisfy the normalization constraint @xmath11 therefore , @xmath12 , the unit sphere , at any point in space - time .",
    "the function @xmath1 is an increasing function such that @xmath13 when @xmath14 and @xmath15 when @xmath16 where @xmath0 is the so - called congestion density . in this paper",
    ", we will consider @xmath17 for simplicity but any other function with similar behaviour would lead to similar results .",
    "the operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 are defined , for a vector field @xmath20 , by @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the transpose operator . finally , @xmath23 is the projection matrix onto the line spanned by @xmath24 , where @xmath24 is the vector @xmath25 rotated by the angle @xmath26 .",
    "alternatively , we have , for a vector @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dot product @xmath30",
    ".    we show in appendix @xmath31 that this model well describes the behaviour of a system of particles subjected to long - range attraction and short - range repulsion in the spirit of a model proposed by aoki @xcite or couzin et al @xcite for modelling gregariousness and swarming .",
    "more precisely , in appendix @xmath31 , we derive this system from such a particle system through successive changes of scales via mean - field and hydrodynamic theories . in the form ( [ eq : omega ] ) , we have dropped the force term describing long - range attraction .",
    "indeed , this force term would add the quantity @xmath32 at the right - hand side of ( [ eq : omega ] ) , with @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a bounded positive kernel .",
    "this terms does not add any differential operator and all the subsequent analysis will stay unaltered by adding this term .    our main concern is the study of the congestion effects brought by the singularity of @xmath1 near the congestion density @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , a herd of animals can be viewed , at large scales , as a domain of space where the density @xmath3 is close to the saturation density @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the geometrical domain occupied by the herd at time @xmath35 can be identified to a set @xmath36 where the parameter @xmath37 must be suitably tuned .",
    "therefore , with the initial model ( [ eq : rho ] ) , ( [ eq : omega ] ) , the definition of a herd depends on an arbitrary parameter @xmath38 , which makes it ambiguous .    a way to unambiguously define",
    "the herd is to force the system ( [ eq : rho])-([eq : omega ] ) to make clear - cut phase transitions from unclustered @xmath39 to clustered @xmath40 phases . in the spirit of the works @xcite for traffic , this can be achieved in an asymptotic regime which amounts to supposing that there is merely no repulsive interactions at all as long as @xmath39 , and that repulsive `` pressure '' forces turn on suddenly when @xmath3 hits the congestion density @xmath0 .",
    "this can be done by rescaling @xmath1 into @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a small parameter . in this way ,",
    "repulsive interactions are @xmath43 as long as @xmath39 , but become @xmath44 when @xmath45 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] ) .",
    "biologically , this assumption amounts to saying that the animals do not change their directed motion by the presence of their neighbours unless they touch them and need to modify their trajectory to bypass them .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 is related to the time scale at which this change of trajectory occurs and is therefore supposed small .",
    "let us also note that our model considers that all animals move with speed unity and never stop .",
    "obviously the model will require improvements by taking into account the fact that a certain fraction of animals are steady , while foraging or resting .    therefore , our main concern in this paper is the study of the following perturbation problem : @xmath46 we will be interested in the formal limit @xmath4 .",
    "a rigorous theory of this type of problems is unfortunately still out of reach up to our knowledge . in the following section ,",
    "we show that the limit @xmath4 leads to a phase transition between compressible and incompressible regimes .      as @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath47 becomes significant only where the convergence @xmath48 is fast enough .",
    "therefore , in the limit , either @xmath49 and @xmath50 or @xmath48 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 possibly non zero . in other words ,",
    "the equation @xmath53 holds in the limit .",
    "if additionally @xmath54 , straighforward inspection shows that @xmath55 therefore , the formal limit @xmath4 of system ( [ eq : rho_eps])-([eq : omega_eps])-([eq : constraint_eps ] ) is given by the following system : @xmath56 in the non - congested domain @xmath39 , the system reduces to a pressureless compressible gaz dynamics model with a speed constraint @xmath57 this system describes the behaviour of the system outside the congested region .",
    "it is a compressible system .",
    "biologically , it describes the behaviour of dispersed animals outside the herd .",
    "mathematical studies of this system are outside the scope of this article and the reader can refer to @xcite for standard pressureless gas dynamics models ( without speed constraint ) .",
    "we note that this system exhibits vacuum regions where @xmath58 as it will be seen below .",
    "the congested part of the flow is defined as the region where the congestion constraint @xmath40 is reached .",
    "biologically , it defines the domain of space occupied by the herd .",
    "its connected components will be called `` clusters '' . in the congested domain ,",
    "system ( [ eq : rho_lim])-([eq : constraint_rho_lim ] ) turns into an incompressible euler model with speed constraint : @xmath59    we first note that smooth incompressible vector fields of constant norm in @xmath60 have a very special structure which is outlined in the following .",
    "let @xmath61 be a smooth vector field on a domain @xmath62 with values in @xmath63 and which satisfies the incompressibility constraint @xmath64 .",
    "then the integral lines of @xmath24 are straight lines and @xmath25 is constant along these lines ( where @xmath24 is rotated by an angle of @xmath26 ) and the integral lines of @xmath25 are parallel curves to each other.[prop : omegcongest ]    the proof of this proposition simply results from introducing the angle @xmath65 so that @xmath66 and noting that @xmath65 satisfies the `` transport equation '' @xmath67 this property implies that the knowledge of @xmath25 on the cluster boundaries suffices to know @xmath25 everywhere inside the clusters .    the integral curves of @xmath25 provide a mathematical description of the animal files in the herd .",
    "these curves being parallel to each other , they are consistant with the intuition and the observation of animal files in a herd ( see fig . [",
    "fig : herd ] ) .",
    "the pressure @xmath52 satisfies an elliptic equation . indeed , by taking the divergence of the equation ( [ eq : omega_lim_bis ] ) and after easy computations ,",
    "we get @xmath68 where tr is the trace of a matrix and the exponent @xmath22 denotes the transpose operator .",
    "this equation can be equivalently written : @xmath69 and only involves the operator @xmath70 applied to @xmath52 . since the integral lines of @xmath24 are straight lines , equation ( [ eq : pressure_bis ] ) is just a one - dimensional elliptic problem for @xmath52 posed on this straight line . knowing the boundary values of @xmath52 where this straight line meets the boundary of the cluster allows to compute @xmath52 everywhere on this lines and consequently inside the cluster ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : herd ] ) .",
    "hence , once @xmath25 is known inside the cluster , the resolution of this equation only requires the knowledge of the boundary conditions for @xmath52 at the boundaries of the cluster .    to close the system ,",
    "i.e. to determine how the solution in the congested domain evolves , we need to determine these boundary conditions .",
    "they are not given by the formal limit and , in order to determine them , we need to explore another route . for this pupose",
    "we look at the solutions of the riemann problem for the perturbed and limit systems .",
    "note that if we abandon the constraint of constant norm @xmath71 , the non conservative term @xmath72 in the momentum conservation equation ( [ eq : omega_lim ] ) drops out , and we recover a conservative model expressing mass and momentum equation .",
    "then , the rankine - hugoniot conditions across the boundary between the compressible and incompressible regions provide the boundary conditions for the pressure at the cluster boundary .",
    "the constant norm constraint prevents from using this strategy .",
    "therefore , we need to find a different route to specify these boundary conditions .      to find the boundary conditions on the cluster boundaries , we need to extract more information from the perturbation system ( [ eq : rho_eps])-([eq : constraint_eps ] ) than the mere limit system ( [ eq : rho_lim])-([eq : constraint_rho_lim ] ) . as such",
    ", this system is underdetermined .",
    "the strategy is to extract such information by passing to the limit @xmath4 in some special solutions of this system .",
    "to underline the difficulty resulting from the non - conservativity , let us first look at the rankine - hugoniot conditions .",
    "we have the following proposition .    1 .",

    "2 .   if @xmath25 is smooth ( i.e. @xmath77 ) across @xmath73 and @xmath3 is smooth on both sides of @xmath73 , then we have @xmath78_{\\gamma}(\\omega\\cdot \\vec{n}^{\\bot } ) = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is a unit vector tangent to @xmath73 .",
    "[ prop : rh_partiel ]    the proof of this proposition is omitted .",
    "the second relation provides us information when the mean velocity is not tangent to the cluster . in this condition , if the mean velocity is continuous , the pressure is also continuous .",
    "this implies that the pressure is zero on a cluster boundary if the mean velocity is continuous .",
    "this fact will be supported by the forthcoming analysis . however , as regards the interface dynamics , such an analysis is incomplete because the second equation supposes that @xmath25 is continuous .",
    "so as to capture the correct boundary conditions for the pressure @xmath52 and the velocity @xmath25 at a cluster boundary where @xmath3 and @xmath25 may be discontinuous , we consider a one dimensional problem in the normal direction @xmath80 to this boundary ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : notation_interface ] ) . in order to justify this simplication",
    ", we introduce the coordinate system @xmath81 in the normal and tangent direction to the boundary . the angle @xmath65 is defined so that @xmath66 in this basis",

    "to analyze this situation , we perform a coordinate dilation in the @xmath83 direction and in time : @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , with @xmath87 . in these new variables ,",
    "all @xmath83 and @xmath35 derivatives are multiplied by @xmath88 .",
    "letting @xmath89 , we are led to the following one - dimensional system with @xmath90 : @xmath91 hyperbolic systems like ( [ eq : rho_1d])-([eq : theta_1d ] ) have analytical solutions which are those of the riemann problem .",
    "these solutions are associated to initial conditions which consist of a discontinuity between two constant states .",
    "we will construct the solutions of the riemann problem for system ( [ eq : rho_1d])-([eq : theta_1d ] ) and analyze their limits as @xmath4 .",
    "this analysis will give rise to jump conditions at the cluster boundaries for these solutions .",
    "we will then postulate that these jump conditions are generic and valid for all solutions of the limit problem ( [ eq : rho_lim])-([eq : constraint_rho_lim ] ) .    as underlined above , the non - conservative form of system ( [ eq : rho_1d])-([eq : theta_1d ] ) induces a lack of information about the jump conditions across a boundary . in order to waive the ambiguity",
    ", we have to make further assumptions .",
    "one of them is to consider the following conservative system as a way to select discontinuities @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "it is the simplest conservation form that system ( [ eq : rho_1d])-([eq : theta_1d ] ) can take .",
    "it is obtained by dividing ( [ eq : theta_1d ] ) by @xmath95 .",
    "the functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 satisfy : @xmath98 other conservative forms of ( [ eq : rho_1d])-([eq : theta_1d ] ) do exist ( see appendix [ appendix : conservative_laws ] ) but we consider this form because it is the simplest . note that this conservative form is not equivalent to the original form ( [ eq : rho_1d])-([eq : theta_1d ] ) because @xmath99 is an even function of @xmath65 .",
    "hence it does not provide information on the sign of @xmath65",
    ". however , this information will easily be recovered at the end .",
    "we remind that , if all conservative forms are equivalent for smooth solutions , they differ for weak solutions . therefore",
    ", the choice of a particular conservative form must be made on physical considerations .",
    "such physical considerations are not available here . in front of this lack of information",
    ", the choice of the simplest of these conservative forms seems to be the most natural one .",
    "classical hyperbolic system theory will enable us to solve the riemann problem for ( [ eq : rho_1d_cons])-([eq : theta_1d_cons ] ) and to take the limit @xmath4 of these solutions .",
    "the limit solutions will satisfy some jump relations which we will assume generic of all solutions of the limit problem ( [ eq : rho_lim])-([eq : constraint_rho_lim ] ) .",
    "we now present the result of this analysis for such generic solutions .",
    "we call `` unclustered '' region ( uc ) the domains",

    "<S> the parts of the fluid where the maximal density is reached behave like incompressible fluids while lower density regions are compressible . </S>",
    "<S> this paper investigates the transition between the compressible and incompressible regions . to capture this transition , we study a one - dimensional riemann problem and introduce a perturbation problem which regularizes the compressible - incompressible transition . </S>",
    "<S> specific difficulties related to the non - conservativity of the problem are discussed .    </S>",
