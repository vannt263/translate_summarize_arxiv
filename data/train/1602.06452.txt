    "the standard unification scheme for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) proposes that the intrinsic properties of agn are similar , and the disparity of observational properties arises from the different viewing angles with respect to an obscuring medium , resulting in type 1 and type 2 agns @xcite .",
    "the reality may be more complex than this simple picture suggests @xcite although there is general agreement that the obscuring medium of gas and dust is a geometrically and optically thick toroidal structure ( perhaps including an outflowing wind , e.g. @xcite ) surrounding the agn accretion disk , with its inner edge at the dust sublimation radius .",
    "numerous observations confirm that there is dust at temperatures in the range 10001500k ( e.g. see @xcite and references therein ) . and a variety of models for smooth @xcite and clumpy @xcite media have been constructed to reproduce the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at infrared wavelengths as well as the silicate feature at @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "however , a number of difficulties remain when applying these models to observations .",
    "@xcite point out that in addition to the parameters describing the physical geometry , the assumptions built into the models can have a major impact on the resulting sed .",
    "and in the best studied cases where interferometry can spatially resolve some of the structure , a component that is aligned along a direction consistent with an outflow appears to be responsible for much of the mid - infrared continuum @xcite .",
    "finally , in the context of the observations we present here , the outer edge of the torus is poorly defined for the majority of these models , because beyond a few tens of parsecs it contributes relatively little to the warm dust continuum against which the models are tested .    on radial scales of tens to a hundred parsecs ,",
    "it is not clear whether one should still refer to the gas and dust structure as a torus or a ( circum-)nuclear molecular disk .",
    "there have been claims that even on these scales the molecular disk is thick enough to have an impact on obscuration towards the agn and so contributes to the observed difference between type  1 and type  2 agn @xcite ; and hydrodynamical simulations suggest that turbulence injected via supernova from recent or on - going star formation can puff up the disk to heights of @xmath8pc @xcite .",
    "spatially resolving molecular tracers on these scales in nearby agn has become possible during the last decade , through the use of adaptive optics systems operating at near - infrared wavelengths and interferometers working in the millimetre regime .",
    "@xcite observed the @xmath9k h@xmath10 via the 2.12 @xmath11 1 - 0s(1 ) line . in most cases",
    "the velocity dispersion ( @xmath12 ) of this line exceeded its rotational velocity ( @xmath13 ) on radial scales of @xmath14pc .",
    "their conclusion was that the disk is relatively thick .",
    "the 2.12 @xmath11 line traces a small excited fraction of the h@xmath10 mass that might have peculiar kinematics , so that kinematics from a tracer of the bulk of the molecular gas is desirable . using the 3 mm hcn(1 - 0 ) line ,",
    "@xcite modeled the emission as a rotating disk , and also found that a large intrinsic velocity dispersion ( @xmath15 ) was required to match the observations .",
    "intriguingly , these results together , @xmath16100kms@xmath3 and @xmath1740kms@xmath3 , suggest that the molecular gas is stratified with the warmest gas being the most turbulent and reaching to larger scale heights while the denser clouds remain closer to the disk plane .",
    "although several observations ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) have confirmed the presence of thick disks with @xmath18 on radial scales of @xmath19pc in some objects , it is not clear how the kinetic energy is continuously supplied in order to maintain the vertical structure of a rotating disk .",
    "one plausible explanation is that nuclear star formation can provide the necessary energy .",
    "stellar radiation pressure @xcite is one option if there are sufficient ob stars and the ism is optically thick .",
    "however , while some observations are consistent with on - going star formation @xcite , others point more towards post - starburst populations @xcite , and in some cases there is clear evidence that there can not be on - going star formation in the central tens of parsecs @xcite .",
    "alternatively , supernova explosions , associated even with a very modest star formation rate , are able to generate sufficient turbulence in the disk to yield @xmath20kms@xmath3 to radii of 25pc @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is that the gas flows induced by disk instabilities toward inner radii can also maintain a thick disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite also argued that the energy from inflowing gas could in principle be used to thicken the central disk .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to model the intrinsic geometry ( i.e. radial and height scales ) of the molecular disk in the central @xmath21pc around agn , by using high resolution hcn(1 - 0 ) and hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) observations .",
    "in addition , we use large velocity gradient ( lvg ) calculations for molecular line ratios to constrain the cloud properties in one of the objects , ngc6951 .",
    "the hcn and hco@xmath0 molecules are ideal indicators of dense gas , since the higher dipole moments of their 1 - 0 rotational transitions can trace @xmath22500 times denser gas than the same rotational transitions of the co molecule , and are sensitive to gas at @xmath23@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "these molecules have been successfully observed not only in dense star - forming regions but also in a number of seyfert galaxies @xcite , although typically at resolutions of 520arcsec . in the nuclear region of seyfert galaxies , hcn(1 - 0 ) and hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) can be excited either by uv light from the accretion disk or x - ray radiation from the corona ( * ? ? ?",

    "the solid blue line represents the continuum flux density within the 3@xmath25 aperture .",
    "the deeper absorption ( the component close to the systemic velocity ) is denoted `` c1 '' ; the broader absorption component ( further blue - shifted from the systemic velocity ) is denoted as `` c2 '' .      assuming that local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) conditions hold , the velocity integrated optical depth can be used to derive the total column density of molecules @xcite . for an absorption line j @xmath45 j + 1 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is",
    "the einstein a coefficient , @xmath48 = 2j + 1 is the statistical weighting of level j , @xmath49 is the energy of level j , @xmath50 = @xmath51 is the partition function , and @xmath52 is the velocity integrated optical depth . in order to calculate this , we have used coefficients from the leiden atomic and molecular database @xcite , for which the energy levels and radiation transitions extend up to j = 29 . the excitation temperature , @xmath53 , is set as 4k which is consistent with a high opacity of the lower transitions and , as concluded for ngc5128 by @xcite , is expected for densities up to @xmath54@xmath24 .",

    ", we need to apply two corrections .",
    "the first one is for the @xmath44c/@xmath1c isotope ratio , which we assume to be 60 , similar to the local interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "however , we note that this conversion may be underestimated if the circumnuclear region has a high star formation rate , for example m82 and ngc253 have @xmath44c/@xmath1c @xmath4 100 @xcite .",
    "the second correction is for the h@xmath44cn abundance @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite have calculated values in the range @xmath63 to @xmath64 for gas on scales of a few to tens of parsecs around an agn , depending on timescale .",
    "these values are for warm ( @xmath21400k ) gas , similar to the molecular gas temperatures found in the central regions of seyfert galaxies @xcite . in the absence of specific constraints",
    ", we adopt the geometrical mean of these two values , @xmath65 , which is consistent with the plentiful evidence for x - ray enhanced hcn abundance around agn .",
    "consequently , @xmath61 for the c1 and c2 components is @xmath66@xmath59 and @xmath67@xmath59 respectively",
    ".    support for the high column density in the central disk of ngc3079 comes from the sio absorption .",
    "numerous observations have shown that sio is commonly found in massive star forming regions and in shocked clumps related to supernova remnants ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) . and enhancement of the sio abundance has been predicted in high temperature chemistry reactions and models which contain shocks or molecular formation in fast molecular outflows @xcite .",
    "we estimate sio column densities for components c1 and c2 in ngc3079 as @xmath68@xmath59 and @xmath69@xmath59 respectively . for both components",
    "the ratio of sio abundance to hcn is in the range 0.020.03 .",
    "these ratios are significantly higher than found in dark clouds or quiescent regions ( where ratios @xmath70 are expected ) , but also significantly less than the range 0.11 found in massive star forming regions . they are more comparable to the perturbed clouds associated with supernova remnant ic443 where @xmath710.06 @xcite , and also to the circumnuclear disk of ngc1068 where @xmath720.1 @xcite . adopting @xmath73",
    "as found by @xcite for ngc1068 , we estimate column densities of 0.3@xmath74@xmath59 for c1 and c2 in ngc3079 .    we note that comparison with @xmath61 derived from x - ray spectra towards the agn is difficult .",
    "an estimate based on a bepposax observation was @xmath75@xmath59 @xcite , while another based on chandra observations was @xmath76@xmath59 @xcite . on the other hand , both x - ray observatories did strongly detect the fek@xmath77 complex at 6.4kev , which is a fluorescence line produced when nuclear continuum radiation is reprocessed by circumnuclear material , and is consistent with heavy absorption .",
    "the central velocities of c1 and c2 are 29kms@xmath3 and 137kms@xmath3 respectively .",
    "this double peaked absorption not only appears in several molecules ( e.g. h@xmath1cn , h@xmath1co@xmath0 , sio and hn@xmath1c ) in the spectrum in figure  [ fig : ngc3079spec ] , but is also present in the oh absorption observed on milli - arcsec scales with the european vlbi network ( evn ) @xcite .",
    "although different observations use distinct molecules , the velocity difference between the two absorption features has a consistent value of @xmath22kms@xmath3 .",
    "owing to the alignment of the water maser distribution with the kiloparsec - scale co molecular structure , @xcite proposed a highly inclined molecular disk , oriented roughly north - south , as the geometry of the nuclear region in ngc3079 .",
    "in addition , @xcite measured the water maser kinematics and concluded the presence of a relatively thick and flared disk structure in the centre .",
    "we adopt these ideas from the literature and suggest that the deeper absorption c1 originates from the blue - shifted part of the rotating molecular disk , which lies in front of the bright radio jet continuum source b , which we discussed in section  [ sec : rngc3079 ] as also being one of the primary sources of the 3 mm continuum . adopting a black hole mass @xmath78m@xmath79 @xcite , and taking into account the inclination of the rotating disk and the location",
    "at which the absorption is occurring , we estimate that the velocity associated with the disk absorption should be @xmath80kms@xmath3 , in good agreement with the observed velocity of component c1 .",
    "in contrast , the red - shifted part of the rotating molecular disk is located behind the other prominent radio jet continuum source , a ; and therefore no equivalent redshifted absorption occurs in the spectrum .",
    "this scenario of off - centre absorption in the nuclear region of ngc3079 is illustrated in the right panel of figure  [ fig : disk_jet_filament ] .",
    "based on this scheme , we argue that c1 may trace the intrinsic column density of neutral hydrogen in the edge - on rotating molecular disk , which we conclude is therefore n@xmath81@xmath59 .    despite the size of our 3 mm beam",
    ", this column is measured at radial scales of @xmath82pc because that is the projected location of the continuum against which the absorption is occurring .",
    "if it applies throughout the nuclear disk , we can estimate a gas mass that we can compare with the dynamical mass @xmath83 from section  [ sec : model_kinematics ] , and hence estimate a gas fraction .",
    "assuming that the absorption is caused by only 12 clouds along the line of sight so that no inclination correction is required , the gas mass within a radius of 112pc ( the same as that used to derive @xmath83 ) is @xmath84m@xmath79 . for @xmath85 = 9.16 $ ] ( table  [ tab : model_int ] ) , we find a gas fraction @xmath86% .",
    "these numbers are remarkably similar to the estimates of @xcite . based on direct co measurements as well as typical gas fractions for local spirals and star formation galaxies , these authors who argued that even with a low gas fraction of 1% the columns exceed @xmath87@xmath59 on scales out to several tens of parsecs , and values are more typically a few @xmath88@xmath59 .",
    "their estimates based on extinction to the stellar continuum ( assuming the obscuring material is mixed with the stars ) suggested slightly lower values with a mean of @xmath89@xmath59 .",
    "our independent measurement based on absorption confirms that in ngc3079 , although the gas fraction in the nucleus is low , there is still sufficient material on scales of at least several parsecs to cause significant optical obscuration from some directions .",
    "absorption component c2 has a broad wing that extends to at least 200kms@xmath3 blueward from the central velocity of c2 .",
    "component c2 could be associated with oh absorption @xcite .",
    "but in contrast to the extended hcn velocity profile , the oh absorption observed with 45-mas resolution ( @xmath90pc ) shows only the deep absorption of c2 without the broad blue - shifted wing .",
    "we suggest below that the broad wing could be caused by absorption in outflowing material .",
    "the h@xmath77 features resembling outflow in the nuclear region of ngc3079 are displayed in the left panel of figure  [ fig : disk_jet_filament ] .",
    "the brightest emission shows that the bubble apex is close to the nucleus , and shocks induced in the bubble wall extend out to large - scales tracing the extent of the super wind @xcite .",
    "an ionized filament with a blue - shifted velocity of 125kms@xmath3 relative to systemic lies at a distance of @xmath91pc ( 45 ) from the nucleus , and its morphology aligns with the vlbi - scale radio jet @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the broad blue - shifted wing  and hence the whole of component c2  may trace outflows on projected scales larger than 4pc but smaller than @xmath92pc ( noting that this corresponds to half the 1  fwhm of the iram beam ) .",
    "this would imply a column density in the outflowing material of @xmath93@xmath59 , comparable with that of the material in the disk .",
    "while this seems remarkably high , outflowing material with a similar high @xmath94@xmath59 has been reported for the seyfert  2 galaxy ngc1433 @xcite .        .",

    "in this section we explore the relation between hcn luminosity @xmath95 and dynamical mass @xmath83 in the central @xmath21pc of seyfert galaxies , and its implications .",
    "we use the combined sample of 8 seyferts with 1  hcn(1 - 0 ) observations and kinematical modelling , as given in table  [ tab : combined ] .",
    "following @xcite , the hcn luminosity is calculated as @xmath96 in units of kkms@xmath3pc@xmath97 , where s@xmath98 ( jykms@xmath3 ) is the velocity integrated hcn flux density and d@xmath99 ( mpc ) is the luminosity distance .",
    "since all our objects are in the very local universe , the @xmath100 term is approximately unity .",
    "the uncertainty in hcn luminosity includes uncertainties from the velocity integrated flux density as well as the distance .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath83 are difficult to quantify robustly because of the assumptions and simplifications in the kinematic model from which @xmath83 is derived . for the galaxies they modelled , @xcite state that the random errors are 1520% excluding the uncertainty for the @xmath101 term . from our modelling , which provides a more statistical estimate of the uncertainties based on the distribution of parameters in the best - fitting models , the uncertainties are 3040% .",

    "however , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , when the line width traces the potential of a galaxy , i.e. @xmath113 , one has to modify equation  [ eq : vir_alpha ] to account for the mass contributed by stars in addition to the gas .",
    "as we have shown in section  [ sec : model_kinematics ] , this is the case for our observations of the hcn(1 - 0 ) lines ; and in section  [ sec : ngc6951 ] we show that in at least one galaxy the clouds are not self - gravitating . in addition , we also note that since the hcn(1 - 0 ) transition has a critical density of @xmath114@xmath24 ( e.g. @xcite ) , the emission traces preferentially dense gas , whereas there may also be a significant mass of gas in less dense clumps , which might instead be traced by co(1 - 0 ) which has a much lower critical density .",
    "following the argument given in @xcite , the relation between dynamical mass and hcn luminosity can be expressed as : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is an equivalent h@xmath10 number density .",
    "then , since @xmath117 , equation  [ eq : nvir_alpha ] can be rewritten as : @xmath118 that there is a relation between @xmath95 and @xmath83 which is close to linear , as is apparent in figure  [ fig : hcndyn ] , implies either that there is an intrinsic relation between @xmath107 and @xmath108 or that there are typical values ( to within a factor of 2 or so ) for both of these quantities .    based on a variety of sources and methods",
    ", @xcite argued that the typical gas mass fraction lies in the range 425% , with a typical value of @xmath119 , within the central 200pc of seyferts .",
    "we adopt this value and , based on equation  [ eq : nvir_dynhcn ] , draw in figure  [ fig : hcndyn ] the lines corresponding to @xmath120 ( long dash line ) , 10 ( dot - dash line ) , and 25 ( dotted line ) .",
    "we find that @xmath121m@xmath122(kkms@xmath3 pc@xmath97)@xmath3 provides a remarkably good approximation to the data . a similar hcn conversion factor @xmath108 = 10@xmath123 for nearby agn ( albeit with beam sizes ranging from a few arcsec up to 20 ) was found via lvg analysis by @xcite .",
    "as they noted , it is @xmath124 times smaller than the @xmath125 estimated by @xcite for nearby spiral , infrared - luminous , and ultraluminous galaxies .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : hcndyn ] rules out such a high conversion factor for the centers of agn since it would imply a gas fraction exceeding 50% . the difference may point towards differing excitation conditions and molecular abundances in the environments , and there is plentiful theoretical and observational evidence that x - ray excitation of gas by the agn does have a major impact on both of these leading to an increase in the hcn luminosity @xcite .",
    "in their high spatial resolution analyses of the br@xmath126 hydrogen recombination line in seyferts , @xcite and @xcite were able to show that there was no on - going star formation in the central @xmath21pc . and as part of their analysis of the hcn line kinematics , @xcite found that while there was often star formation occurring in circumnuclear rings at radii @xmath127100pc , on smaller scales the evidence indicates that the star formation rates were much lower .",
    "our aim in this section is to assess whether the clouds in the central region are self - gravitating .",
    "if they are not , this could be one reason why star formation appears to be suppressed on these scales .",
    "we focus on ngc6951 which is one of the seyfert galaxies in the combined sample summarised in table  [ tab : combined ] , and for which suitable data are available .",
    "observations reported by @xcite provide the hcn(1 - 0)/co(2 - 1 ) ratio , which is 2.5 ( if units for line fluxes are kkms@xmath3 ; it is 0.37 if the line flux units are jykms@xmath3 ) as discussed by @xcite .",
    "these data have similar small beams and so are spatially resolved , which is important since the distributions of the two lines are very different . here",
    "we use the line ratio corresponding to the central component only .",
    "in addition , @xcite reported the hcn(3 - 2)/hcn(1 - 0 ) line ratio as 0.4 corrected for beam filling factors .",
    "although the beam for these data is larger ( and specifically , the hcn(1 - 0 ) measurement used for this line ratio is a single dish measurement rather than the interferometric measurement used for the other line ratio ) , it is less critical since both lines are from hcn and so are expected to have more similar distributions . since the beam includes the circumnuclear ring ,",
    "there is some uncertainty associated with whether the line ratio reflects that in the nucleus .",
    "however , a similar measurement by @xcite on ngc1068 with a smaller beam that probes only regions well within the circumnuclear ring , yielded a hcn(3 - 2)/hcn(1 - 0 ) ratio of 0.21 ( as such , given the hcn(1 - 0)/co(2 - 1 ) ratio from @xcite discussed by @xcite , the analysis below could equally apply to ngc1068 ) ; and a ratio of 0.15 has been reported for the nucleus of ngc1097 by @xcite . while these two galaxies could also be used for this analysis , we have not included them here .",
    "this is partly because they are not part of our combined sample . for ngc1068",
    "it is also because the nuclear region of ngc1068 is very complex , having a circumnuclear bar feeding gas in to the nucleus while an outflow from the agn disrupts the disk ( @xcite ) . for ngc1097 ,",
    "it is also because the agn is very weak and can not really be classified as a seyfert .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : lvg6951 ] even a large uncertainty in the hcn(3 - 2)/hcn(1 - 0 ) ratio does not alter the general conclusion that the clouds can not be self - gravitating .    in order to derive the physical conditions under which these line ratios can arise , we make use of the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation @xcite , which has been widely used in the literature to study gas conditions and excitiation in normal and active galaxies .",
    "it is important to realise that lvg calculations apply to individual clouds . on the other hand ,",
    "the observations we use are of an ensemble of clouds .",
    "however , under the usual assumption that all the clouds in the ensemble are the same , the line ratios will not depend on the number of clouds : they will be the same for a single cloud and for the ensemble .",
    "we note , however , that this is not the case for the line width , which is very different for a single cloud and for the ensemble . as such , to interpret the modelled ratio @xmath128 , or equivalently @xmath129 , in the context of the observations would require additional assumptions that one sees all the clouds and that their individual line profiles and relative velocities combine to match the observed line profile .",
    "however , our results are not affected by this issue because our comparison of the lvg calculations to observations is based solely on line ratios .",
    "we use the lvg calculations performed by @xcite ( we refer to that paper for details of the code and comparison to the commonly used radex ) and extended them to include the hcn(3 - 2)/hcn(1 - 0 ) line ratio .",
    "the calculations cover a wide range of parameters : kinetic temperature @xmath130 \\leq 300 $ ] , hcn to co abundance ratio @xmath131 ( with @xmath132 as the co abundance relative to hydrogen ) , h@xmath41 volume gas density @xmath133 \\leq 10^{7}$ ] , and a ratio of gas - density to velocity - gradient , or equivalently column density to linewidth , of @xmath134 \\leq 5\\times10^{23}$ ] .",
    "one plane of this parameter space is shown in figure  [ fig : lvg6951 ] .    for reference",
    ", we show the boundary ( dot - dash blue line ) , to the right of which clouds are self - gravitating ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . for virialised clouds @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the velocity dispersion , @xmath137 is the cloud radius , and @xmath138 is the gas volume density .",
    "the self - gravitating boundary line is found by treating @xmath139 as a velocity gradient , which gives @xmath140 as shown .",
    "we have also marked the regions where one expects to find galactic clumps and cores , using the typical properties summarised by @xcite and estimating @xmath128 from their density , size , and velocity width .",
    "galactic clouds , with densities of @xmath141500@xmath24 , are outside the range of the plot . their sizes of 215pc and",
    "velocity widths of 25kms@xmath3 indicate they have @xmath142 and so lie just left of the extension of the self - gravitating line .",
    "we now discuss how , although the lvg calculation formally has 5 free parameters , we can reach a robust conclusion with only 2 line ratios .",
    "the first parameter is the co abundance @xmath143 , but because this hardly varies for a wide variety of conditions we fix it at @xmath144 .",
    "the hcn abundance @xmath62 is also a parameter .",
    "but it was already shown by @xcite that the hcn(1 - 0)/co(2 - 1 ) ratio alone requires an unusually high hcn abundance , @xmath145 .",
    "since this is already much higher than the typical abundance , although still consistent with what one might expect theoretically from calculations of equilibrium abundances in x - ray irradiated gas @xcite , we fix it at @xmath146 .",
    "the volume density @xmath147 and ratio of column density to linewidth @xmath128 are the axes of the plot and therefore left as free parameters . finally , the temperature @xmath148 is unconstrained .",
    "we have therefore plotted red curves tracing the locus of the line ratios above for ngc6951 assuming a temperature of 100k ; and show in addition the location where the two curves intersect for temperatures of 30k and 300k ( asterisks joined by the green curve ) , a range that covers the temperatures one might expect to find in the central regions of seyferts @xcite .",
    "this shows the well known degeneracy between temperature and density , but also indicates that , unless the temperature of the molecular gas significantly exceeds 300k , the gas density must be @xmath149 \\ga 4.5 $ ] .",
    "one very clear conclusion from the figure is that , independent of temperature and density , the locus of intersections for the line ratios lies far to the left of the region where one finds self - gravitating clouds . indeed , for the range of temperatures we have considered ,",
    "the inferred pressure is roughly constant at @xmath150@xmath24k suggesting that the clouds are likely to be pressure confined .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite for hii regions and giant molecular clouds in the interacting antennae galaxy system : self - gravity only bound clouds above a certain mass threshold , and below this they must be bound by external pressure .",
    "intriguingly the pressure we find is comparable to that found by @xcite in the central few hundred parsecs of galaxies with starburst driven superwinds .",
    "as such , the line ratios observed in the centre of ngc6951 are consistent with an environment dominated by supernovae , perhaps indicative of a young post - starbust .",
    "we have presented 3 mm interferometer data from the iram pdbi , which spatially resolves the hcn(1 - 0 ) and hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) molecular lines in the central few arcsecs of three nearby seyfert galaxies : ngc3079 , ngc6764 , and ngc5033 .",
    "the main results of this study are as follows :    1 .   for these galaxies , and",
    "also ngc7469 , we use a rotating disk model that takes into account beam smearing , to successfully match the observed line distribution and kinematics . the characteristics of ngc5033 can be fitted by a thin disk having @xmath151 . in contrast",
    "ngc7469 , ngc3079 , and ngc6764 all favour a thick disk with @xmath152 . combining these results with the earlier study of @xcite , we find that in 7 out of 8 seyferts , the hcn(1 - 0 ) line traces thick rather than thin disks in the central @xmath21pc .",
    "the spectrum of ngc3079 is dominated by numerous absorption lines , which are characterised by a double peak profile .",
    "the component closest to systemic is caused by absorption in the approaching side of the inner disk , which lies in front of a radio continuum knot in the north - west jet . based on the depth of the h@xmath1cn(1 - 0 ) feature ( since h@xmath44cn(1 - 0 )",
    "is both saturated and blended with emission ) , we estimate the hydrogen column density in the disk to be @xmath153@xmath59 . the other absorption component , with a broad blue - shifted wing extending to @xmath2kms@xmath3 , suggests the existence of a dense nuclear outflow . correcting the hcn(1 - 0 ) and hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) lines for continuum absorption",
    "indicates that the emission lines are also partially self - absorbed .",
    "we find a relation between hcn luminosity and dynamical mass .",
    "this implies either a relation between , or typical values for , the gas fraction and the conversion factor @xmath108 between hcn luminosity and gas mass .",
    "a gas fraction of @xmath119 and @xmath7 ( consistent with the conclusion of @xcite from lvg calculations ) can account for the observed relation .",
    "an analysis of the hcn(1 - 0)/co(2 - 1 ) and hcn(3 - 2)/hcn(1 - 0 ) line ratios in ngc6951 indicates that the molecular gas is not in self - gravitating clouds .",
    "instead , the clouds are likely to be pressure confined .",
    "the implied pressure of @xmath154@xmath24k is comparable to that measured in the centers of superwinds , suggesting that the interstellar medium in the centre of ngc6951 is consistent with an environment dominated by supernova .",
