    "<S> the spin dynamics of the high t@xmath0 cuprates is a fundamental issue in the study of high t@xmath0 superconductivity for two reasons . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting state of the high t@xmath0 cuprates is evolved from and is neighbored by an antiferromagnetic ordered insulating state . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the d - wave superconduting pairing in the high t@xmath0 cuprates is widely believed to be mediated by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations . however , after the intensive studies in the last two decades , it remains elusive if the spin dynamics of the high t@xmath0 cuprates is more appropriately described by an itinerant or a local picture . in the magnetic ordered parent compounds , both the itinerant and the local picture work well . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the static magnetic order is melt by doping , it becomes unclear if the local spins remain their integrity . in the itinerant picture , </S>",
    "<S> collective spin fluctuation emerges only when the system is close to magnetic ordering instability and is essential only near the magnetic ordering wave vector . on the other hand , in the local picture , </S>",
    "<S> the integrity of the local spin is dictated by the strong local electron correlation . </S>",
    "<S> it thus survives even when the system is far away from magnetic instability and when the probing momentum is far away from the magnetic ordering wave vector . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a detection of the high energy spin excitations in momentum regions far away from the ordering wave vector can provide key information on the nature of spin dynamics in the high t@xmath0 cuprates .    </S>",
    "<S> most of our understandings on the spin dynamics of the high t@xmath0 cuprates are obtained from the inelastic neutron scattering(ins ) measurements@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a universal feature uncovered by these ins studies is the @xmath5 resonance mode in the superconducting state , which is explained successfully in the itinerant picture as a spin exciton mode below the superconducting gap and is taken as a strong support for d - wave pairing . </S>",
    "<S> however , as a result of the limited neutron flux , most ins measurements are made around the antiferromagnetic ordering wave vector @xmath6 and are limited to relatively low excitation energies . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , the situation is changed dramatically as the resonant inelastic x - ray scattering(rixs ) emerges as a powerful way to study the spin dynamics of the high t@xmath0 cuprates@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . together with ins , we are now able to probe the spin excitation spectrum in the high t@xmath0 cuprates in a much larger momentum and energy range@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a shocking result from these studies is that the high energy spin wave excitation of the parent compounds survives even in the heavily overdoped systems , for which clear signature of electron itineracy(such as well defined fermi surface , sharp quasiparticle peak and well defined d - wave bcs gap ) have been confirmed by other measurements . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , a spin - wave - like dispersive peak is observed in the spin excitation spectrum by rixs along the @xmath3 to @xmath4 line . </S>",
    "<S> apart from a significant broadening , both the dispersion and the integrated intensity of this peak are found to be almost doping independent below @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath8 is the density of the doped holes .    </S>",
    "<S> the observation of robust high energy spin wave excitation in the heavily doped cuprates poses a serious challenge for theoretical understanding of high temperature superconductivity . from the strongly correlated point of view , the appearance of dispersive high energy spin excitation itself is not that surprising , since the local spins remain their integrity in the doped system . </S>",
    "<S> the doped charge carriers act only to dilute the existing local spins and to cut short their spatial correlations . at sufficiently short length scale </S>",
    "<S> , we should still expect dispersive spin excitations . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is highly nontrivial how this behavior can be integrated into a theory which can simultaneously account for the electron itinerancy around the fermi surface observed by arpes measurements@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the rpa treatment of the spin dynamics@xcite , the spin collective mode is only well defined around @xmath6 and is limited to rather low excitation energies . for momentum far away from @xmath6 , the spin fluctuation spectrum is essentially unchanged by the rpa correction and is composed of a broad particle - hole continuum that can extend in energy up to the band width(see supplementary material a for an example ) . </S>",
    "<S> another important difference between the local and the itinerant picture is about the local spin sum rule . according to the local picture </S>",
    "<S> , the spin fluctuation spectrum should satisfy the sum rule of @xmath9 as a result of the no double occupancy constraint . </S>",
    "<S> this sum rule is important for a correct description of the spin dynamics in the local picture and is violated in the itinerant picture .    </S>",
    "<S> the gutzwiller projected bcs state is generally believed to be a good variational description of the superconducting state of the high t@xmath0 cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> after the gutzwiller projection , the no double occupancy constraint and the local spin sum rule are enforced exactly . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies on this state indicate that it offers a rather good account of the single particle excitation around the fermi surface@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a recent projected rpa calculation on this state also explains well the evolution of the @xmath5 resonance mode with doping@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we thus wonder if the same wave function is also consistent with the new observations made by recent rixs measurements .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the dispersion of the spin excitation in the single mode approximation for the @xmath1 model with the gutzwiller projected bcs state as the variational ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the single mode approximation is just the right choice since almost all the observed spectral weight in the rixs measurements are concentrated in a single broadened peak . </S>",
    "<S> we first derive an exact form of the mode dispersion for the @xmath1 model in the single mode approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the gutzwiller projected bcs state to evaluate the expectation values involved in the dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> we find when the observed pairing gap is used in the calculation , a very good agreement with the rixs observations can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the fermionic rvb theory based on the gutzwiller projected bcs state can not only account for the low energy excitation at the energy scale of the pairing gap , but can also provide an accurate description of the local spin correlation of the high t@xmath0 cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> it thus provides a balanced account of the itinerant and the local aspect of the electronic excitations in the high t@xmath0 superconductors .    in the single mode approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the spin wave excitation at momentum @xmath10 is created by acting on the ground state with the spin density operator @xmath11 and has the form @xmath12 in which @xmath13 is the ground state of the system and is assumed to be normalized . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation energy of this mode is @xmath14 in which @xmath15 is the hamiltonian of the system . </S>",
    "<S> when the spin fluctuation spectral weight at momentum @xmath10 is distributed in a single broadened peak , as is the case observed in rixs measurements along the @xmath16-m line@xcite , we can also interpret @xmath17 as the center of gravity of this broadened peak . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated intensity of this peak is given by the spin structure factor , or @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the spin fluctuation spectrum at momentum @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the single mode approximation , the spin fluctuation spectrum is totally determined by the ground state wave function .    </S>",
    "<S> following well known procedures , it can be shown that the mode energy @xmath17 can be calculated from the expectation value of the double commutator between the hamiltonian and the spin density operator in the ground state . </S>",

    "<S> we thus get a closed form for the mode dispersion for the @xmath1 model in the single mode approximation . from eq.[eqn7 ] , it is clear that the dispersion of the mode is mainly determined by the momentum dependence of the spin structure factor @xmath38 , since the expectation values @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the nominator are all local quantities that are not sensitive to the exact form of the ground state @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> the coefficients of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , namely @xmath66 and @xmath40 , are all local quantities and can both be estimated accurately from the variational ground state . to reproduce the linear dispersion in the long wave length limit , the spin structure factor must be linear in @xmath10 in the same limit . </S>",
    "<S> this is just what we expect in a fermi liquid with a nonzero density of state on the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , the spin structure factor in a fermi gas is given by @xmath67 , in which @xmath68 is the dispersion of the fermion . </S>",
    "<S> in the long wavelength limit , only those states that are within a shell of thickness proportional to @xmath10 around the fermi surface can contribute to @xmath38 , which is thus proportional to both @xmath10 and the density of state at the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , in the superconducting state , the low energy spin excitation is gapped out by the superconducting gap and the spin structure factor is given by @xmath69 in which @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> in the long wavelength limit , the bcs coherence factor @xmath71 is suppressed quadratically as a result of the singlet pairing . </S>",
    "<S> thus the spin structure factor @xmath38 is a quadratic function of momentum for small @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we find the above argument also apply to the gutzwiller projected bcs state . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why @xmath17 is gapped at the @xmath16 point for small @xmath8 in fig.[fig2]a .    with these understandings , </S>",
    "<S> we now improve the variational ground state . for this purpose , we note the pairing gap as determined from the variational theory is actually much larger than that observed in experiments . more specifically , both arpes and transport measurement find that @xmath60 at the optimal doping@xcite , while the value of @xmath72 determined from the optimized variational parameters is about 0.2 for @xmath61(see fig.[fig1]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the observed contour of equal energy around the gap node is about a factor of 4 more anisotropic than that predicted by the variational theory . for this reason , </S>",
    "<S> we scale down the size of the pairing gap by a factor of four so as to match the observed value of @xmath72 . the mode energy calculated with the rescaled pairing gap </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig.[fig2]b , which is seen to be much more consistent with the dispersion reported in rixs measurements . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the doping dependence of mode dispersion becomes now very weak and an approximate linear dispersion is recovered in the long wavelength limit . </S>",
    "<S> the overall scale of the dispersion is about 2.2@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this also agrees well with the rixs data if we assume @xmath63 mev .    in fig.3 , we plot the doping dependence of the integrated mode intensity @xmath42 along the @xmath16-m line . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath42 is almost independent of the doping along the whole @xmath16-m line . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the observation of rixs measurements . </S>",
    "<S> however , we note @xmath42 is strongly doping dependent around the antiferromagnetic ordering wave vector @xmath6(see the supplementary material b ) .    -m line . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters used here are the same as that used in fig.[fig2]b . </S>",
    "<S> , width=264 ]    thus , the main observations of the rixs measurements can be well explained by the fermionic rvb theory , if the observed pairing gap , rather than that determined from variational optimization , is adopted . </S>",
    "<S> together with the results of extensive studies on the quasiparticle properties of the gutzwiller projected bcs state , our results indicate that the fermionic rvb theory can not only provide a consistent understanding on the low energy excitations around the fermi surface , but can also provide an accurate description of the local physics of the high - t@xmath0 cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> the fermionic rvb theory is thus a promising framework to unify both the itinerant and the local aspect of electronic excitations in these doped mott insulators . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the rixs data remind us again that the pairing gap is overestimated substantially in the standard fermionic rvb theory . </S>",
    "<S> this overestimation is most likely caused by the insufficient account of the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the fermionic rvb theory , which competes with the tendency of spin singlet pairing . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable since both the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and the d - wave spin singlet pairing are driven by the same spin superexchange interaction in the @xmath1 hamiltonian . a more advanced theory of the high t@xmath0 cuprates should of course treat both ordering tendencies on the same footing .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note the single mode approximation becomes less useful around @xmath6 , as the spin fluctuation spectrum develops finer structures in this momentum region@xcite ( supplementary material b contains a more detailed discussion on this point ) . a general approach to study these structures in the fermionic rvb theory is proposed recently by us@xcite . </S>",
