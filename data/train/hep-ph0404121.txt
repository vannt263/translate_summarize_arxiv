    "there is no doubt that the study of neutrino masses and of flavour mixing in the leptonic sector will play a crucial role for uncovering new physics beyond the standard model and to test unification .",
    "in fact , the recent discovery of neutrino oscillations in atmospheric and solar neutrinos ( see @xcite for an overview ) has raised the puzzle of the origin of the mass hierarchy among the various neutrino flavours , a mystery which , at the moment , remains unsolved .",
    "the study of the mixing among the leptons also raises the possibility of detecting possible sources of cp violation in this sector as well .",
    "it seems then obvious that the study of these aspects of flavour physics requires the exploration of a new energy range for neutrino production and detection beyond the one which is accessible at this time .    for this purpose ,",
    "several proposals have been presented recently for neutrino factories , where a beam , primarily made of muon neutrinos produced at an accelerator facility , is directed to a large volume located several hundreds kilometers away at a second facility .",
    "the goal of these experimental efforts is to uncover various possible patterns of mixings among flavours - using the large distance between the points at which neutrinos are produced and detected - in order to study in a more detailed and `` artificial '' way the phenomenon of oscillations .",
    "detecting neutrinos at this higher energies is an aspect that deserves special attention since several of these experimental proposals @xcite require a nominal energy of the neutrino beam in the few gev region .",
    "we recall that the incoming neutrino beam , scattering off deuteron or other heavier targets at the detector facility , has an energy which covers , in the various proposals , both the resonant , the quasi - elastic ( in the gev range ) and the deep inelastic region ( dis ) at higher energy . in the past , neutrino scattering on nucleons has been observed over a wide interval of energy , ranging from few mev up to 100 gev , and these studies have been of significant help for uncovering the structure of the fundamental interactions in the standard model .",
    "generally , one envisions contributions to the scattering cross section either in the low energy region , such as in neutrino - nucleon elastic scattering , or in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) region .",
    "recent developments in perturbative qcd have emphasized that exclusive ( see @xcite ) and inclusive processes can be unified under a general treatment using a factorization approach in a generalized kinematical domain .",
    "the study of this domain , termed deeply virtual compton scattering , or dvcs , is an area of investigation of wide theoretical interest , with experiments planned in the next few years at jlab and at desy .",
    "the key constructs of the dvcs domain are the non - forward parton distributions , where the term _ non - forward _ is there to indicate the asymmetry between the initial and final state typical of a true compton process , in this case appearing not through unitarity , such as in dis , but at amplitude level .    in this work , after a brief summary of the generalities of process , we discuss its generalization to the case of neutral currents .",
    "we recall that dvcs has been extensively studied in the last few years for electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the extension of dvcs to the case of neutral currents is presented here , while the charged current version will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "also , in this work we will just focus on the lowest order contributions to the process , named by us deeply virtual neutrino scattering ( dvns ) in order to distinguish it from standard dvcs , while a renormalization group analysis of the factorized amplitude , which requires an inclusion of the modifications induced by the evolution will also be presented elsewhere .",
    "the application of the formalism that we develop here also needs a separate study of the isoscalar cross sections together with a detailed analysis of the various experimental constraints at neutrino factories in order to be applicable at forthcoming experiments .",
    "compton scattering has been investigated in the near past by several groups , since the original work by ji and radyushkin @xcite .",
    "previous work on the generalized bjorken region , which includes dvcs and predates the `` dvcs period '' can be found in @xcite .    a pictorial description of the process we are going to illustrate is given in fig  [ dvcs_1.eps ] where a neutrino of momentum @xmath6 scatters off a nucleon of momentum @xmath7 by an interaction with a neutral current ; from the final state a photon and a nucleon emerge , of momenta @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , while the momenta of the final lepton is @xmath10 .",
    "the process is described in terms of new constructs of the parton model termed generalized parton distributions ( gpd ) or also non - forward ( off - forward ) parton distributions .",
    "we recall that the regime for the study of gpd s is characterized by a deep virtuality of the exchanged photon in the initial interaction ( @xmath11 ) ( @xmath12 2 gev@xmath13 ) , with the final state photon kept on - shell ; large energy of the hadronic system ( @xmath14 gev@xmath13 ) above the resonance domain and small momentum transfers @xmath15 gev@xmath13 .",
    "the process suffers of a severe bethe - heitler ( bh ) background , with photon emission taking place from the lepton .",
    "therefore , in the relevant region , characterized by large @xmath16 and small @xmath17 , the dominant bethe - heitler background @xmath18 and the @xmath19 behaviour of the dvcs scattering amplitude render the analysis quite complex . from the experimental viewpoint a dedicated study of the interference bh - vcs is required in order to explore the generalized bjorken region , and this is done by measuring asymmetries . opting for a symmetric choice for the defining momenta , we use as independent variables",
    "the average of the hadron and gauge bosons momenta    p_1,2= |p q_1,2= |q    with @xmath20 being the momentum transfer . clearly        and @xmath21 is the nucleon mass .",
    "there are two scaling variables which are identified in the process , since 3 scalar products can grow large in the generalized bjorken limit : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath25 is a small parameter in the process .",
    "momentum asymmetries between the initial and the final state nucleon are measured by two scaling parameters , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , related to ratios of the former invariants    = -|q^22 |p = |q2 |p|q    where @xmath26 is a variable of bjorken type , expressed in terms of average momenta rather than nucleon and z - boson momenta .",
    "the standard bjorken variable @xmath28 is trivially related to @xmath26 in the @xmath29 limit . in the dis limit",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 , while in the dvcs limit @xmath33 and @xmath34 , as one can easily deduce from the relations    q_1 ^ 2=(1 + ) |q^2 + , q_2 ^ 2=(1 - ) |q^2 + .",
    "we introduce also the inelasticity parameter @xmath35 which measures the fraction of the total energy that is transferred to the final state photon .",
    "notice also that @xmath36 measures the ratio between the plus component of the momentum transfer and the average momentum .",
    "a second scaling variable , related to @xmath26 is @xmath37 , which coincides with bjorken @xmath38 @xmath39 when @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath26 , therefore , parametrizes the large component of the momentum transfer @xmath40 , which can be generically described as    = 2 |p +    where all the components of @xmath41 are @xmath42 .",
    "in the study of ordinary dis scattering of neutrinos on nucleons ( see fig .  [ dis ] ) , the relevant current correlator is obtained from the t - product of two neutral currents acting on a forward nucleon state of momentum @xmath7",

    "the hadronic tensor @xmath46 is related to the imaginary part of this correlator by the optical theorem .",
    "we recall that for an inclusive electroweak process mediated by neutral currents the hadronic tensor ( for unpolarized scatterings ) is identified in terms of 3 independent structure functions at leading twist    w_=(- g_+ q_1q_1q_1 ^ 2 ) w_1(,q^2)+ ^^p_1 ^ 2w_2(,q^2)m^2 -i_q_1^p_1^w_3(,q^2)2 m^2    where transversality of the current is obvious since @xmath47 .",
    "the analysis at higher twists is far more involved and the total number of structure functions appearing is 14 if we include polarization effects .",
    "these are fixed by the requirements of lorenz covariance and time reversal invariance , neglecting small cp - violating effects from the ckm matrix .",
