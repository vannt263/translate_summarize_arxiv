    "there can be little doubts that a tenable cosmological model must include at least two dark components , cold dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) ; yet only hypotheses on their nature exist , most of them assuming that dm and de are physically unrelated and that their similar densities , in today s world and just in it , are purely accidental .    attempts to overcome this conceptual deadlock were made by several authors suggesting , first of all , that de has a dynamical nature @xcite ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an alternative idea is that de is a phenomenological consequence of the emergence of nonlinearity ; this appealing option was repeatedly considered ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , but is far from being shown and leaves however apart the question of dm nature .",
    "interactions between dm and dynamical de @xcite ( see also @xcite ) might partially cure the problem , keeping close values for their densities up to large redshift .",
    "this option could also be read as an approach to a deeper reality , whose physical features could emerge from phenomenological limits to coupling strength and shape .",
    "a longer step forward was attempted by @xcite , suggesting that dm and de derive from a single complex scalar field , being its quantized phase and modulus , respectively .",
    "the complex field could be the one responsible for @xmath1 conservation in strong interactions , within a scheme similar to peccei & quinn framework @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . at variance from previous suggestions , which introduce parameters and aim at limiting them through data fitting , this option @xmath2dubbed _ dual  axion _",
    "model@xmath2 cuts the available degrees of freedom , including as many parameters as a standard ",
    "cdm approach .",
    "it is then quite appealing that its reduced parameter budget is sufficient to fit quite a number of observational constraints @xcite , still allowing for a common nature of dm and de and for a specific shape of interaction between them .    in this paper , however , we keep on the phenomenological side and discuss generic constraints to dm  de interactions",
    ". this discussion will have a fallout also on the _ dual  axion _ approach , which does face a problem , because of the feature of the dm  de coupling it causes .",
    "a coupling of baryons with de is ruled out by observational consequences similar to modifying gravity .",
    "limits are looser for dm  de coupling , whose consequences can be appreciated only over cosmological distances .",
    "it should also be outlined that forces acting within the dark sector could modify predictions on high concentration dm lumps .",
    "there can be little doubts that cold dm particles , feeling gravity only , give them nfw profiles . yet",
    ", observational data do not lend much support to this shape , for any scale range , and direct interaction between dm particles is severely constrained also by recent data .",
    "this is a further reason to consider dm  de interactions , either as a fundamental theory or as an effective framework to approach deeper physics .",
    "it is then important to devise any observational limit to such interactions and , in this paper , we outline further constraints to its shape ; they are consequences of the early behavior of density fluctuations , over scales destined to evolve into non  linear structures .",
    "fluctuations over such scales enter the horizon before matter  radiation equality and their growth is initially inhibited by the overwhelming density of the radiative component , then still behaving as a single fluid together with baryons . while fluctuations in the fluid behave as sonic waves , self gravitation of dm is just a minor dynamical effect is respect to cosmic expansion .",
    "this freezing of fluctuation amplitudes until equality is known as _",
    "meszaros effect_.    the main point we wish to outline here is that dm  de coupling can damp meszaros effect , so that the rate of fluctuation growth , between the entry in the horizon and equality , is significantly enhanced . as a matter of fact , fluctuation freezing is essential , in shaping the transfered spectrum , which peaks on the scale @xmath3 entering the horizon at equality . at smaller mass scales ( @xmath4 ) the spectrum declines because of the increasing duration of the freeze .",
    "the freezing or its damping have modest consequences on the evolution of fluctuations in baryons and radiation , evolving then in the sonic regime .",
    "what we shall therefore find are significant changes in the transfer funcions , while cmb spectra keep almost unaffected .",
    "constraints to coupled de models arise from both linear and non  linear effects .",
    "it has been known since long that coupling may cause a @xmath5md epoch after matter  radiation equality ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this changes the ( comoving ) distance of the last scattering band . in order to fit data",
    ", the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath6 needs then to be increased .",
    "limits on @xmath6 turn then into limits to the coupling .",
    "limits to the coupling , in the case of a ratra peebles @xcite self  interaction potential , where also found in @xcite , by studying halo concentration distibution .",

    ". we shall also exhibit cmb angular spectra , to confirm that they suffer just marginal changes .",
    "no general data fitting , constraining parameters and/or showing specific model advantages , will be made here .",

    "we show results for @xmath27gev .",
    "the sugra potential , at least in the absence of coupling , yields an excellent fit of observational data @xcite .",
    "we tested the effects of coupling for a number of values of the scale @xmath7 , from 10 to @xmath28 , and also changing the shape of the potential into ratra  peebles .    in the former case we find just marginal shifts . in the latter one",
    ", quantitative changes can be significant .",
    "the overall behavior is however identical and this potential is known to yield a poor fit to cmb data , unless quite a small @xmath7 scale is taken , so spoiling its physical appeal .    within this frame",

    "an expression of @xmath40 made by a polynomial including terms with different powers of @xmath41 could select a peculiar epoch to have then a weaker or stronger coupling .",
    "such an option , however , is clearly _ ad  hoc _ and does not seem to deserve further investigation",
    ".    an explicit dependence of @xmath34 upon time would be hard to reconcile with the lorentz invariance of the lagrangian mass term @xmath42 setting the coupling between the de scalar field @xmath5 and a spinor field @xmath43 supposed to yield dm , as @xmath44 ( notice that @xmath45 is the time  dependent mass of dm quanta ) .",

    "the situation is not much improved for @xmath174 , while lower values of @xmath149 are admitted for @xmath175 . in particular , a model with @xmath31 , as the _ dual  axion _ model , lays outside of the range indicated .",
    "the analysis was extended here to models with positive @xmath176 for which coupling rises while @xmath5 increases .",
    "a large deal of these models is apparently allowed .",
    "the quest for models fitting observational data and avoiding fine tuning and coincidence suggests to test cosmologies where dm is coupled to dynamical de .",
    "it is then important to recognize that quite a few models , with constant or variable dm  de coupling , are consistent with observational data , although their likelihood might be slightly smaller than uncoupled models .",
    "constraints on these models were known to arise from a number of linear and non  linear effects .",
    "the main linear anomaly is the existence of a prolongated period , after matter radiation equality , when the @xmath5field energy affects the expansion rate ( the @xmath5md epoch ) . as a consequence",
    ", the comoving distance of the last scattering band can be different from ordinary models . in principle , this can be compensated by varying the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath177 there are however severe limits on @xmath178 which turn into limits on the coupling strength , discussed in @xcite .",
    "the same feature causes also a displacement of the wave number @xmath163 corresponding to the scale which enters the horizon at matter  radiation equality .",
    "here we discussed also this effect , which was however expected .",
    "constraints on coupled de models were also found by studying their non  linear evolution . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that coupling can affect the halo concentration .",
    "although this effect could be softened by using suitable self ",
    "interaction potentials , it yields a limit @xmath1790.20 , for the coupling , when the self  interaction potential is ratra ",
    "peebles @xcite .",
    "in this paper we outlined a new effect , that dm ",
    "de coupling may cause in a class of models .",
    "a prolongated period , between the horizon entry and the equivalence , when dm fluctuation growth stagnates , is essential in shaping transfered spectra @xmath180 because of this _ meszaros _ s effect , @xmath181 bends at @xmath182 in this paper we outline that this stagnation period can be partially or totally suppressed by the coupling of dm with the @xmath5 field . as a result , transfered spectra exhibit a much softer bending at @xmath183 we also outline that , while this occurs , the dynamics of sonic waves in the baryon ",
    "photon fluid is only marginally affected . accordingly , while transfered spectra suffer major changes , cmb anisotropies are almost invariant .    using a single primeval spectral index @xmath121 , we can fit both cmb and deep sample data , in the presence of standard meszaros effect . in the presence of the above softening",
    ", the values of @xmath121 required to fit cmb and deep sample data become badly discrepant .    in this work",
    "we discuss which class of coupled de models are affected by this anomaly .",
    "if the coupling is constant or proportional to a positive power of @xmath41 the anomaly is absent . on the contrary ,",
    "models where the coupling is proportional to an inverse power of @xmath5 are at risk .",
    "we gauge the impact of this anomaly by evaluating the value of @xmath121 required to fit just deep sample data with each model .",
    "when @xmath184 it is legitimate to believe that the model likelihood is highly suppressed .",
    "the search of such @xmath121 value should therefore be preliminary to any attempt to reconcile a coupled model to the whole set of cmb , deep sample ( and other ) data .",
    "admittedly , apart of conceptual reasons , within the present observational framework there lacks any specific phenomenological push to invoking a dm  de coupling . yet , uncoupled models , even apart of their conceptual weakness , cause a number of questionable predictions , e.g. nfw profiles .",
    "interactions within the dark side were often advocated to cure such difficulties . an impact on profiles",
    "was actually shown to exist , but new form of coupling need to be inspected .",
    "furthermore , fresh data on the redshift dependence of @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 , at @xmath1885 , might soon be available , if experiments like dune @xcite will become operational .",
    "the discovery of an anomalous scaling of @xmath185 , for instance , would set a strong prior , completely biasing likelihood distributions , just as priors on the value of @xmath122 ( hubble parameter ) suppress the likelihood of scdm models with @xmath189 which would otherwise allow a reasonable fit of large sets of data @xcite .",
    "in particular , models with rising coupling ( @xmath190 ) could become an important option .",
    "such coupling behavior could directly arise from suitable microphysics or be a phenomenological description of a complex underlying physics .",
