    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include the national aeronautics and space administration and the department of energy in the united states , the commissariat  lenergie atomique and the centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules in france , the agenzia spaziale italiana and the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare in italy , the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board in sweden .",
    "additional support for science analysis during the operations phase is gratefully acknowledged from the istituto nazionale di astrofisica in italy and the centre national dtudes spatiales in france .",
    "part of this work was done with the contribution of the italian ministry of foreign affairs and research for the collaboration project between italy and japan .",
    "we thank the _ swift _ team for making these observations possible , the duty scientists , and science planners .",
