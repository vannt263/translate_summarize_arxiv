    "in addition , the shocked agb wind is mainly molecular near the source but becomes mainly atomic near the tip ( except for the newly shocked agb wind ) because of shock dissociation .",
    "in contrast , the shocked fast wind is mainly atomic .    in the simulation , a jet - like structure",
    "is seen at the tip because of the accumulation of material there due to the shock focusing effect , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "such accumulation might be artificially enhanced in our 2d simulations because material can not flow across the symmetry axis .",
    "this enhancement in turn would lead to more cooling and further accumulation , and then an increase in the formation rate of molecules . therefore ,",

    ", however , the shell structure in this model is significantly less extended than that seen in the observations ( fig .",

    "the cfw here is the same as that in model 1 but with a temporal variation in density and velocity with an amplitude @xmath41 ( i.e. , @xmath42 km s@xmath32 ) and a period @xmath43 yr ( see * ? ? ?",

    "note that the assumed value of the temperature is not important , because the temperature of the cfw will drop rapidly below 100 k in 200 au ( or @xmath29 ) due to radial expansion and radiative cooling ( fig .",

    "@xcite , having compared their jet and bullet models , argued that the bow - shock heads of bullets take on a v - shaped configuration and are thus more consistent with the observations of crl 618 , whereas bow - shock heads of jets are more u - shaped .",
    "however , the assumed density and thus the mass - loss rate of the agb wind in their models are about a factor of 1000 less than those assumed in our models , which are more appropriate for crl 618 @xcite . with a high density of the agb wind",

    "the jet model in @xcite may instead apply to another ppn oh 231.8 + 4.2 , which shows a wide and more u - shaped outflow lobe @xcite .      in our models ,",
    "the cfw is assumed to be molecular in order to have hv molecular emission near the source along the body of the lobe .",
    "it could be intrinsically molecular .",
    "it could also be intrinsically atomic and become molecular right after launched due to its high mass - loss rate , as proposed for protostellar wind @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the hv molecular emission could arise from the entrained agb material that was originally close to the source , as suggested by @xcite , or in the inner dense torus - like core around the source , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "it is not clear in our simulations , however , how this entrainment can happen once the shell is formed and shields the fast wind from being interacting with the agb wind around the source .",
    "it probably can happen if the fast wind is actually launched from around a binary companion .",
    "as the agb wind flows to the companion , an accretion disk can form @xcite and launch the fast wind , and then the fast wind can entrain the agb wind .",
    "we have presented simulations of cfw models including molecular cooling and time dependent chemistry of hydrogen . we have also derived from our simulations intensity maps and position velocity diagrams for co j=2 - 1 , j=6 - 5 , and 2 1 - 0 s(1 ) emission and compared them to recent observations of crl 618 . in our models ,",
    "limb - brightened shell structures are seen in co and 2 at low velocity arising from the shocked agb wind in the shell , and can be identified as the low - velocity ( lv ) components in the observations .",
    "however , the shell structure in co j=2 - 1 is significantly less extended than that seen in the observations .",
    "none of our models can properly reproduce the observed high - velocity ( hv ) molecular emission near the source along the body of the lobe . in order to reproduce the hv molecular emission ,",
    "the cfw is required to have a different structure .",
    "one possible cfw structure is the cylindrical jet , with the fast wind material confined to a small cross section and collimated to the same direction along the outflow axis .",
