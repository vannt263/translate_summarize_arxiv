    "the determination of a cluster s equilibrium structure is a challenging task for the theoretician . for small clusters",
    "the first aim is usually to determine the lowest - energy minimum on the potential energy surface using global optimization tools",
    ". the global minimum must be the equilibrium structure at zero temperature , and it is usually _ hoped _ that it will provide a good guide to the structure at higher temperatures . by locating the global minimum as a function of size a detailed picture of the cluster structure and the non - monotonic variation of cluster properties can be obtained .",
    "this can then allow a detailed comparison with experiments on size - selected clusters@xcite and mass spectroscopic studies where the abundances provide an indicator of particularly stable clusters.@xcite    however , global optimization becomes increasingly difficult as the size increases , because of the exponential increase in the number of minima.@xcite furthermore , optimization of some sizes may be particularly difficult because the potential energy surface has an unfavourable topography.@xcite these effects limit the size for which global optimization is feasible .",
    "for example , for the simple lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , after extensive study and computational effort , it is likely that the true global minimum for all lj clusters up to 150 atoms have now been found.@xcite however , the last new putative global minimum in this size range was found as recently as 1999.@xcite plausible putative global minimum have also been found up to @xmath0=309.@xcite for more complex potentials the present maximum feasible size is of course likely to be considerably smaller .",
    "some clusters already exhibit bulk - like structures in the sizes accessible by global optimization ( e.g.  the alkali halides with rocksalt structure@xcite ) , however many do not .",
    "extreme examples are provided by sodium clusters , which exhibit icosahedral structures up to at least @xmath1 atoms,@xcite and by boron suboxide particles , which can have mackay - like icosahedral structures with @xmath2 atoms.@xcite    therefore , to go beyond the maximum size feasible for global optimization a different approach is necessary .",
    "this is possible if one settles for a more coarse - grained picture of the size evolution of cluster structure .",
    "so , rather than focussing on the the detailed size dependence , the general competition between structural types is instead followed .",
    "the question is then what type of structure is most likely to be lowest in energy in a particular size regime , rather than what is the particular arrangement of the atoms in the lowest - energy minimum .",
    "typically the energies of particularly stable sequences are compared to locate the crossover size at which the structure of the lowest - energy sequence changes .",
    "this method is commonly used and so crossover sizes have been estimated for lj clusters,@xcite metal clusters for elements such as tungsten,@xcite nickel,@xcite sodium,@xcite lead,@xcite , iron,@xcite gold,@xcite calcium and strontium,@xcite rhodium and palladium,@xcite and aluminium;@xcite and molecular clusters for molecules such as n@xmath3,@xcite co@xmath3@xcite and sf@xmath4.@xcite    to get accurate crossover sizes it is important that the lowest - energy sequences for each structural type are used .",
    "the shapes of the optimal sequences are those that most closely resemble the polyhedron derived from the wulff construction ( or a modified form of it for non - crystallographic structures@xcite ) , which minimizes the surface free energy .",
    "however too many of the studies using this approach compare sub - optimal clusters.@xcite for example , it is particularly common to compare ino decahedra and fcc cuboctahedra to mackay icosahedra , because they can have exactly the same sizes , even though the most stable sequences are likely to more closely resemble truncated octahedra and marks@xcite decahedra .    as only the energies of the sequences are computed , the crossover sizes derived are only strictly valid for zero temperature .",
    "usually the possible effects of temperature on these crossovers are neglected , and it is _ hoped _ that they will provide a reasonable guide for higher temperatures .",
    "this neglect is probably because a simple way to compute the entropic contribution to the free energy of a structural type has not been available .",
    "similarly in experiments on the evolution of cluster structure , size is usually the only variable that is considered , and so a single ( presumably temperature independent ) crossover size is presented.@xcite    however , there is an increasing body of theoretical evidence that thermal effects can play a key role in determining a cluster s structure .",
    "there are a growing number of examples of solid - solid transitions in clusters where the structure changes from fcc or decahedral to icosahedral as the temperature increases .",
    "such transitions have been found to occur for those small lj clusters that have a non - icosahedral global minimum,@xcite for gold clusters@xcite , for clusters interacting with a variable range morse potential.@xcite and even for models of clusters of c@xmath5 molecules.@xcite for molecular clusters , where low - pressure solid - solid or orientational phase transitions occur for bulk , there has also been much interest in the size - dependence of the transition temperature .",
    "e.g. sf@xmath4.@xcite    here we examine in detail the effects of entropy on the equilibrium structure of lj clusters . in section [",
    "sect : ss ] we focus on the solid - solid transitions in those lj clusters that have a non - icosahedral global minimum .",
    "in particular we examine the different contributions to the entropy in detail . using the principles learned from these examples , in section [ sect :",
    "phased ] we introduce methods to estimate the free energy of stable sequences of structures .",
    "thus we are able to construct structural phase diagrams showing how the structure depends upon both size and temperature .",
    "there has been a previous attempt to calculate such structural phase diagrams based upon macroscopic estimates of the different contributions to the free energy of a structure.@xcite however , it is unclear how valid the approximations made in that study are , in particular the applicability of the macroscopic concepts to a small cluster . clearly , a much more satisfactory approach is , as here , to compute the free energies directly from microscopic properties .",
    "finally in section [ sect : discuss ] we consider some of the other factors that determine cluster structure and how these effect the comparison with experiment .",
    "a brief report of some of this work has already appeared.@xcite     structures of the global minimum ( upper half ) and the lowest - energy icosahedral minimum ( lower half ) for those lj clusters with a non - icosahedral global minimum .",
    "the labels denote the size and energetic rank of the minima.,width=309 ]",
    "the atoms in the clusters interact via a lennard - jones potential@xcite and so the total potential energy is : @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the pair well depth and @xmath8 is the equilibrium pair separation .",
    "most lj global minima for @xmath9 have structures based upon the series of mackay@xcite icosahedra.@xcite however , there are a number of non - icosahedral global minima",
    ". these occur at sizes where the non - icosahedral morphology has a near optimum shape , whereas the icosahedral structures have an incomplete outer layer . for @xmath10",
    "there are 8 such cases , which correspond to the fcc truncated octahedron at @xmath0=38,@xcite the marks decahedra at @xmath0=7577 and 102104,@xcite and the leary tetrahedron at @xmath0=98.@xcite these global minima and the lowest - energy icosahedral minima for these sizes are depicted in figure [ fig : nonicos ] . in the range @xmath11",
    "there are a further eight non - icosahedral global minima which are clustered in two sets around the complete marks decahedra at @xmath0=192 and 238.@xcite    for these examples it has been found that the global minima are not the most stable structure up until the cluster melts , but that a low - temperature solid - solid transition occurs at which icosahedral structures become thermodynamically more stable.@xcite however , these transitions are difficult to probe because there are large ( free ) energy barriers between the structural types,@xcite making the dynamics of the transition extremely slow .",
    "they occur on time scales way beyond those accessible with conventional molecular dynamics .",
    "for example , at the centre of the transition for lj@xmath12 the rate constant has been estimated to be 43s@xmath13 ( using parameters appropriate for ar).@xcite the equivalent rates for the larger clusters are likely to be orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the only simulation method that has been able to directly compute the equilibrium thermodynamics of the solid - solid transitions of any of these clusters is parallel tempering @xcite ( and its variants@xcite ) .",
    "exchange of configurations between monte carlo runs at different temperatures allows ergodicity to be achieved at the low temperatures relevant to the solid - solid transitions .",
    "however , even for the smallest example , lj@xmath12 , this method is computationally demanding.@xcite    the superposition method @xcite provides an alternative approach and one which is particularly useful for our present purposes because it allows us to analyse the different contributions to the entropy . in this approach",
    "the partition function is written as a sum over all the minima on the potential energy surface , i.e. @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the partition function for the basin of attraction surrounding minimum @xmath16 .",
    "as long as all relevant minima are represented , ergodicity is ensured .",
    "the method is particularly simple to apply to solid - solid transitions as the number of minima that contribute to the transition is comparatively few .",
    "the method can also be applied to the melting of clusters , but in this case a statistical representation of the distribution of minima has to be used , because the number of minima associated with the liquid is , for all but the smallest clusters , too large to be enumerated.@xcite another particularly useful feature of the method is that , by restricting the sum to a certain subset of the minima , the thermodynamic properties of a particular region of configuration space can be obtained , i.e. @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the partition function for region @xmath19 .    to apply this method to the solid - solid transitions in lj clusters",
    ", we first generated large samples of low - energy minima for each cluster using established techniques for searching potential energy surfaces.@xcite some of these samples had been generated previously in work on the characterization of the potential energy surface topography of lj clusters using disconnectivity graphs.@xcite the samples included thousands of minima , which is far more than would actually significantly contribute to the low - temperature thermodynamics .",
    "we then have to assume a form for the partition function of each minimum . here",
    ", we use the harmonic approximation , which in the classical limit gives @xmath20 where @xmath21=@xmath22 , @xmath23=@xmath24 is the number of vibrational degrees of freedom , @xmath25 is the potential energy of minimum @xmath16 , @xmath26 is the geometric mean vibrational frequency , and @xmath27=@xmath28 is the number of permutational isomers of @xmath16 , where @xmath29 is the order of the point group .",
    "this harmonic superposition method ( hsm ) has been shown to give a correct qualitative picture of cluster thermodynamics ( even of the melting transition @xcite ) , which becomes increasingly accurate at lower temperatures .",
    "accurate anharmonic forms for @xmath15 are available,@xcite but the derivation of the associated parameters characterizing the degree of anharmonicity adds an extra degree of complexity , which is unnecessary here given the low temperatures at which the solid - solid transitions occur .",

    ", the effect of the vibrational entropy can be clearly seen from the slopes of the phase boundaries in fig .",
    "[ fig : phased ] and from the differences between the crossover sizes at zero temperature and the melting point ( table [ table : xover ] ) . at higher temperatures icosahedra and marks decahedra remain most stable up to considerably larger sizes than would be expected from their energetic crossovers .",

    "lower values of @xmath51 are associated with structural types with a greater strain energy ; the physical origin of this correlation will be explored elsewhere .",

    "there has been much interest in the phase changes in clusters as the finite - size analogues of bulk phase transitions .",
    "the finite size , which can lead to unusual features , such as negative heat capacities,@xcite causes any transition to occur not at a single temperature , but instead both phases can coexist over a range of temperature.@xcite this is illustrated by the finite width of the peaks in figure [ fig : cv ] . we can easily estimate this coexistence range for our examples if we define the upper and lower limit of this coexistence range , @xmath56 , as the temperatures at which @xmath57=(0.1,0.9 ) and ( 0.9,0.1 )",
    "this gives @xmath58 however , as the size at which these transitions occur is large , the @xmath59 term does not significantly effect the denominator and so the coexistence range is very small .",
    "when @xmath56 are plotted on figure [ fig : phased ] the lines are indistinguishable from those for the mid - point of the transition .",
    "the assumption of harmonicity was one of the approximations used to construct the structural phase diagram of figure [ fig : phased ] .",
    "it has been previously found that this approximation leads to an overestimate of roughly 10% in the value of the melting temperature for small lj clusters , because the liquid - like state is significantly more anharmonic.@xcite one would expect the errors to be less for @xmath32 because the differences in anharmonicity between two solid forms are likely to be much less and because the relevant temperatures are often much lower .",
    "one can introduce the effects of anharmonicity via temperature dependent frequencies , i.e.  @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a measure of the anharmonicity.@xcite this then gives for the transition temperature : @xmath62 as the temperature occurs on both sides of this equation , it would have to be solved self - consistently .",
    "alternatively an approximate solution can be obtained by taking the first terms of the binomial expansion of the second log and then substituting in the harmonic expression for @xmath32 .",
    "this gives @xmath63 the second term represents an anharmonic correction to @xmath64 . to apply this equation , estimates of the size dependence of @xmath61",
    "would be required , which could then be fitted to a form equivalent to equation ( [ eq : nuvn ] ) .",
    "methods are available to obtain @xmath65,@xcite but unfortunately we were not able to extend these to sufficiently large sizes to enable fits of sufficient accuracy to be generated that could be applied to the large sizes relevant to figure [ fig : phased ] .    we have also so far assumed that the clusters behave classically . however , it has recently been shown that quantum effects can have a significant effect on the thermodynamics of lj clusters.@xcite we can apply these same methods to obtain quantum structural phase diagrams , which are applicable to the rare gases .",

    "structural phase diagrams for rare gas clusters , illustrating the effect of the introduction of quantum effects .",
    "the classical results are solid lines ( lj ) , and the phase boundaries for the rare gas clusters are as labelled",
    ". , width=309 ]    the introduction of quantum effects can also lead to significant changes in the melting temperature of clusters.@xcite following ref .",
    "we simply model this change by @xmath71 where the coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 have been obtained using results for small clusters,@xcite and @xmath74 is the de boer parameter .",
    "@xmath74 is a measure of the quantum delocalization and corresponds to the value of @xmath75 in reduced units , i.e.  @xmath76 .",
    "we have calculated structural phase diagrams for values of the de boer parameter that are appropriate to some of the rare gases .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure [ fig : quantum ] and table [ table : xover ] .",
    "there are two competing effects on the structural phase diagrams resulting from the introduction of quantum delocalization .",
    "firstly , the zero - point energy stabilizes those structures with lower frequencies , and therefore the zero temperature crossover sizes increase substantially as @xmath74 increases ( table [ table : xover ] ) .",
    "indeed the differences between neon and the other rare gases at low temperature are large enough to be potentially observable , if equilibrium clusters can be grown in this temperature range . secondly",
    ", for temperatures lower than the vibrational temperature @xmath77 , the vibrational contribution to the entropy is much less in the quantum case .",
    "this is a corollary of the fact that for a quantum harmonic well @xmath78 is close to zero at low temperature and only rises near to 3 above @xmath79 , whereas classically @xmath80 for all @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of the crossover sizes are diminished , and the phase boundaries initially rises vertically from the x - axis and in some cases even cross the classical line .",
    "a comparison of the energy interpolated between particularly stable sequences and the energies of the global minima .",
    ", width=309 ]    the development of the structural phase diagrams presented here provides the starting point for a more sophisticated discussion of the size evolution of cluster structure , which emphasizes the effect of both size and temperature .",
    "the one - dimensional picture which focusses on the effect of size and neglects thermal effects should be discarded .",
    "therefore , we hope that this work will provide a stimulus for new experiments and calculations that seek to illuminate the role of temperature in determining structure .",
    "indeed , recent experiments on clusters of c@xmath5 molecules@xcite and strontium clusters@xcite illustrate the interesting results that can be achieved .",
    "the methods developed here should be applicable to a wide range of materials , for which empirical potentials are available .",
    "an illustrative example for silver clusters modelled by the sutton - chen potential@xcite has already been provided.@xcite this system has a structural phase diagram which was similar in form to that for lj clusters .",
    "however , it would be particularly interesting to map out the different possible families of phase diagrams .",
    "for example , in sodium clusters there would also be additional competition between the icosahedral , decahedral and fcc structures considered here and clusters that are body - centred cubic .",
    "these methods could also be potentially applied to clusters in a matrix or on a surface .",
    "this point of view should also help in comparisons of experiment and theory , and of different experiments .",
    "firstly , it helps one not to jump to hasty conclusions .",
    "for example , if two experiments come to different structural conclusions for clusters of the same size , this does not necessarily imply that there has been a misinterpretation of the data ; the differences might simply reflect different temperatures .",
    "similarly , the failure of energetic calculations to reproduce the experimental observations does not necessarily imply the inadequacy of the theoretical description of the interatomic forces , because free energies need to be calculated for a rigorous comparison .",
    "secondly , and more positively , theoretical and experimental agreement on the size and temperature dependence of structure would provide a strong vindication of the approaches used .",
    "there are a number of aspects that should be born in mind when interpreting the structural phase diagrams .",
    "firstly , they only provide a coarse - grained picture of the size evolution , dividing the phase diagram into regions where the _ majority _ of sizes have the same equilibrium structure . to construct the diagrams we have assumed a monotonic dependence of properties on @xmath0 ( equations [ eq : evn ] , [ eq : nuvn ] and [ eq : tm ] ) .",
    "however , as is well - known , most cluster properties show a complex non - monotonic size dependence , particularly for smaller clusters.@xcite indeed , it is these size effects that are often of most interest .",
    "this non - monotonicity is illustrated for @xmath52 in figure [ fig : vibgmin ] and for @xmath82 in figure [ fig : egmin ] .",
    "similarly , the variation in @xmath83 for small lj clusters has been catalogued by frantz.@xcite it is noticeable that the variations in @xmath82 and @xmath52 can be of a similar magnitude to the systematic differences between the structural types .",
    "for example , at three points the energies of the global minima in figure [ fig : egmin ] coincide with those for truncated octahedra ( @xmath0=38 ) and complete marks decahedra ( @xmath0=75,192 ) .",
    "consequently , the real phase boundaries when resolved at the level of individual sizes will be much rougher than in figure [ fig : phased ] .",
    "indeed , the examples in section [ sect : ss ] correspond to small islands of stability for fcc and decahedral structures , within a sea of icosahedral dominance at small @xmath0 .",
    "the relative importance of these variations does diminish with increasing size as the proportion of atoms in the surface decreases .",
    "consequently , the coarse - grained approach used for the structural phase diagrams becomes more reliable at larger sizes , but should be applied with caution when crossovers occur for sizes with less than a few hundred atoms .",
    "there are other implications of this decrease in fluctuations .",
    "for example , it is clear from figure [ fig : egmin ] that the 38-atom truncated octahedron will be the only fcc global minimum up to at least @xmath0=1000 .",
    "secondly , the position of the phase boundaries in the diagrams sensitively depends on the , usually small , differences in the energetic and vibrational properties , in particular @xmath84 and @xmath85 , between structural types .",
    "it is asking a lot of an empirical potential to reproduce these properties accurately enough to give phase diagrams that could agree in detail with experiments .",
    "for the current example , where different structural types are all based in some sense upon close - packing but perhaps involving multiple twinning and hence strain , the crucial ingredients for the energetics would be a correct reproduction of the relative surface energies for @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 faces , and the elastic moduli that determine the energetic penalty associated with the strain .",
    "similarly , one would also want the potential to reproduce not only the bulk phonon dispersion curves , but also the effects of surfaces and strains on the vibrational properties .",
    "furthermore , if one were to apply this approach to clusters , where , as for sodium , two different bulk structures could be adopted , the potential would also have to be able to reproduce the properties of both forms .",
    "however , most empirical potentials are only fitted to a small subset of these properties , usually those associated with the bulk .",
    "therefore , given the current limitations associated with empirical potentials and the current impossibility of performing ab initio calculations for the relevant size ranges , it is perhaps better to use the tools developed here to understand the qualitative form of the structural phase diagram one would expect for a particular material .",
    "thirdly , the experiments one is seeking to compare with may not be at equilibrium .",
    "evidence for the non - equilibrium nature of many clusters has come from a number of sources .",
    "it is suggested by the mixture of structures often observed for metal clusters , for example , when supported clusters are probed by electron microscopy@xcite or x - ray diffraction;@xcite greater structural uniformity would be expected for samples of equilibrium clusters .",
    "more rigorous evidence for the kinetic origin of this diversity comes from experiments that have shown that the structural composition can be changed simply through the cluster source conditions,@xcite and that well - defined structures are only obtained after careful annealing.@xcite similarly , it has recently been shown for clusters of c@xmath5 molecules that the equilibrium non - icosahedral structures are only located after annealing at high temperature.@xcite    this difficulty of achieving equilibrium is also suggested by a range of recent theoretical results .",
    "for example , the potential energy surfaces of the examples in section [ sect : ss ] have a multiple - funnel character , where the different funnels correspond to the different structural types.@xcite this multiple - funnel character is not restricted to these examples but appears to be ubiquitous.@xcite as the ( free ) energy barriers between funnels are typically large , the dynamics of structural transformations can be very slow , giving rise to the possibility of kinetic trapping in out - of - equilibrium structures .",
    "this effect is seen in recent growth simulations.@xcite typically , above a certain size , which is dependent on the material , temperature and growth rate , structural transformations are unlikely , and so new growth then occurs around this preserved seed cluster .",
    "the results are particularly dramatic for ( c@xmath5)@xmath89 where perfect mackay icosahedra are invariably formed , even though they are far from equilibrium.@xcite similarly , it has been found that freezing of molten clusters give rise to a a mixture of products,@xcite where the relative amounts reflect the width of the respective funnels,@xcite rather than the thermodynamics .",
    "these results emphasise that it will be difficult to obtain equilibrium when a structural type is only favoured at low temperature .",
    "this is particularly the case for the larger sizes often associated with the decahedral to fcc crossover .",
    "many of the above considerations are relevant when we seek to compare our results for lennard - jones clusters with experimental results for rare gas clusters .",
    "the first difficulty is that a clear - cut picture has not yet emerged from the experiments . the most easy to interpret data comes from mass spectroscopic studies of rare gas cluster ions .",
    "clear magic numbers that are signatures of icosahedral packing have been observed for small clusters of argon,@xcite krypton and xenon.@xcite the icosahedra have been observed up to @xmath0=923 , with no sign of any crossover to a different structural type.@xcite however , the situation is less clear for neon . in the only mass spectroscopy experiment on neon clusters , of which we are aware , no strong signal of shell effects was found.@xcite it should also be remembered that there may be differences between the structure of ions and neutrals , as illustrated by recent calculations for ne@xmath90,@xcite although these differences would be expected to be less important as the size is increased .",
    "there have also been a series of experiments by farges _",
    "et al . _",
    "using electron diffraction to probe argon clusters.@xcite to reach a structural assignment the experimental diffraction patterns have to be compared to those calculated for structures of the appropriate size .",
    "although this provides good evidence that small clusters are icosahedral with a suggested crossover from icosahedra at @xmath91 , it has proved to be much harder to obtain a good fit to experiment for larger clusters with neither decahedral or fcc structures providing adequate agreement .",
    "van de waal has investigated a series of models that provide better fits , which include features such as crossed stacking faults,@xcite crossed twins@xcite that could lead to faster growth .",
    "for very large clusters , however , adequate agreement could only be obtained from polycrystalline clusters , involving fcc , hcp and random close - packed domains.@xcite these results again seem to confirm the difficulty of achieving equilibrium , and are further reinforced by simulations of the freezing of lj clusters , in which a mixture of structural forms is observed for larger clusters.@xcite    somewhat different conclusions have been reached from exafs experiments on argon clusters,@xcite in which fcc structures were suggested for clusters with more than 200 atoms .",
    "however , this conclusion was based on comparison with results obtained for a very limited set of candidate structures , and no estimate of the experimental temperature was given .",
    "given the above experimental situation it is not surprising that there is not yet full agreement between experiment and theory .",
    "furthermore , although the lj potential provides a reasonable description of the properties of the rare gases ( including the phonon dispersion curves@xcite ) , it has well - known deficiencies.@xcite therefore , one should not necessarily expect too close agreement for the crossover sizes .",
    "however , we believe the basic form of the structural phase diagram to be robust . therefore , it would first be interesting to see if an icosahedral to decahedral crossover could be revealed for argon clusters as the experimental clusters are brought closer to equilibrium . then",
    ", if this could be achieved , it would be interesting to see if the temperature dependence of the crossover size that we have predicted here was reproduced .",
    "the results we have obtained for lj clusters have highlighted the important role that differences in vibrational entropy can play in determining structure .",
    "striking examples for the considerable effect of vibrational properties on phase diagrams have also been obtained for the thermodynamics of substitutional alloys.@xcite similarly , in the field of supercooled liquids there have been recent suggestions , based upon simulation @xcite and calculations for model potential energy surfaces,@xcite that vibrational properties could play a key role in the complex interplay that gives rise to the distinction between fragile and strong liquids .",
