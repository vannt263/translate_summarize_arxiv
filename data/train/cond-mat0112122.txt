    "single mesoscopic superconducting rings  @xcite and disks  @xcite have attracted a lot of attention during the last years .",
    "the superconducting properties of these single samples have been studied experimentally and are rather well described and understood theoretically .",
    "many of these studies were limited to disks  @xcite and rings  @xcite of zero thickness .",
    "in such a case the magnetic field induced by the supercurrents are neglected and one assumes that the total field equals the external field , which is taken uniform . in the present paper disks and rings with _",
    "finite _ thickness are considered . in this case",
    "the superconductor tries to expell the field .",
    "supercurrents are induced creating a local magnetic field opposite to the external one .",
    "this leads to a decrease of magnetic field inside the superconductor and an increase near the sample edges . for sufficiently large disks and magnetic fields",
    ", the magnetic field penetrates the superconductor and vortices are created , which corresponds to regions of local field compression . in small disks , only circular symmetric vortex states",
    "nucleate in the center , which are called giant vortex states . encircling the vortex on a closed loop ,",
    "the phase change of the order parameter equals @xmath1 times @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is the angular momentum or vorticity . in larger disks",
    ", seperate vortices can nucleate creating a multivortex state and the vorticity @xmath1 is just the number of vortices . in the case of rings , the magnetic field can be expelled to the inside or to the outside of the ring or partially to both sides .    in the present paper",
    "we want to understand what will happen if two mesoscopic superconductors are put close to each other but are electrically isolated .",
    "when an uniform magnetic field is applied , it will be locally altered by each of the superconductors . in some regions of space the field",
    "will be expelled from the superconducting disk or ring , while in other regions it will be compressed into vortices penetrating the sample or compressed into the inside of a superconducting ring .",
    "this results in a strongly nonuniform total field , which is the superposition of the applied field and the field created by the supercurrents .",
    "another superconductor will interact with this nonuniform field . in this way",
    "the superconductors are coupled by the magnetic field and they are interacting with each other .",
    "this coupling will influence the properties of the two superconductors .",
    "it is this coupling that will be studied in the present paper .    the magnetic coupling between normal mesoscopic rings is well known .",
    "@xcite studied theoretically the persistent currents of @xmath3 normal rings placed periodically on the same plane . because of the mutual inductance between two rings , the electric current in one ring produces an induced flux in the other ring , creating an extra current in this ring .",
    "they found that the mutual inductance between normal rings enhances the persistent current as was the case in the experiments described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "correlations in arrays of magnetically coupled superconducting aluminium rings were investigated experimentally by davidovi _",
    "they used ultrasensitive susceptibility techniques and scanning hall probe microscopy to study arrays of electrically isolated superconducting rings of micron - size .",
    "when the external flux is close to @xmath4 ,  the magnetic moments produced by the supercurrents in such rings are analogous to ising spins .",
    "magnetic moments parallel to the applied magnetic field can be called ",
    "spin up  , while those in the opposite direction  spin down  . via their dipolar magnetic fields",
    ", neighbouring rings can interact antiferromagnetically and the different rings are influencing each other .",
    "recently , morelle _",
    "et al _  @xcite studied experimentally the magnetic interaction between two superconducting mesoscopic aluminium rings , close to the superconducting / normal phase transition . in their sample ,",
    "a smaller ring was placed in the center of the larger ring . using resistivity measurements",
    "the phase boundary was obtained for the two - ring structure as well as for the reference single ring . in both systems",
    ", little - parks oscillations were observed in the @xmath0 phase diagram .",
    "the modification of the @xmath5 oscillations of the outer ring is seen in the fourier spectrum of the @xmath5 line due to the coupling between the outer and the inner ring .",
    "they suggested that an inner ring made from a different superconductor with a higher critical temperature would increase the magnetic coupling between the two rings .    in the present paper",
    "we present a theoretical investigation of the properties of two coupled mesoscopic superconductors .",
    "our main attention will go to the interaction between the two superconductors .",
    "how are they influencing each other ?",
    "how do the superconducting properties of a single ring change when another superconductor is placed in its center ?",
    "therefore , we consider two different configurations : ( i ) a ring - disk configuration where a small disk is placed in the center of a larger ring , and ( ii ) a ring - ring configuration where a small ring is placed in the center of the larger ring as in the experiment of ref .",
    "we will also give an example of a ring - ring system where the inner ring is made from a different superconductor with a higher critical temperature .",
    "our theoretical analysis is based on a full self - consistent numerical solution of the coupled non - linear ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "since we consider sufficiently narrow rings and small disks , only axial symmetric giant vortex states will nucleate  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the equations can be solved for a fixed value of the vorticity . the magnetic field profile outside and inside the superconductor is obtained self - consistently and , therefore , the full demagnetization effect is included in our approach .",

    "notice that , in this paper , the free energy is expressed in units of @xmath100 , where @xmath51 is the sum of the disk and the ring volume .",

    "@xmath103 the disk is in the normal state , which results in @xmath104 . in the single ring , on the other hand , different giant vortex states with vorticity @xmath105 up to @xmath106 can nucleate before the ring becomes normal at @xmath107 .",
    "next , we introduced the magnetic coupling between the disk and the ring and the results are given by the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ emagrd](a ) .",
    "the different axial symmetric states are determined by the vorticity of the disk @xmath58 and the total vorticity @xmath57 , which is equal to the vorticity of the ring .",

    "notice further that we could also write @xmath112 instead of @xmath113 because for the applied magnetic fields where the @xmath114 state in the ring exists the disk is normal even for @xmath115 we have chosen to write @xmath110 because this expresses more clearly that there is flux going through the disk .",
    "if both the disk and the ring are superconducting , the free energy of the total sample is different from the sum of the free energies of the single disk and the single ring .    to investigate these new states in more detail we consider as an example the @xmath116 state .",

    "the reason is that the applied field is so low that a lot of magnetic flux has to be attracted to create a state with @xmath124 in the outer ring .",
    "therefore , a very high superconducting current has to flow through the outer ring which leads to the destruction of superconductivity in this ring .",

    "therefore , the superconducting current changes sign in the ring region ( see the dashed curve in fig .  [ curretc](b ) ) . since the flux is expelled in both directions , the dashed curve in fig .

    "the current in the ring has to flow in the same direction as the current in the disk , which is shown by the dash - dotted curve in fig .",

    "[ emagrd](a ) ) .",
    "notice that there is a small difference between the two set of curves , which is due to the coupling between the two superconductors .",
