    "is studied in more detail and we show that simple knots are invariant by a change of phase .",
    "minimal knots will be denoted by @xmath104 .    in section 3 ,",
    "we study the symmetries of minimal knots .",
    "recall that there are two natural symmetries among knots that are involutions ; the mirror symmetry @xmath105 , ( symmetry of a knot with respect to a orientation reversing symmetry of @xmath0 ) and the inversion of a knot @xmath106 which maps a knot to the same knot but with the reverse orientation .",
    "@xmath16 is invertible if it is invariant by @xmath106 and amphicheiral if it has some invariance with respect to @xmath105 results of section 2 and easy computations yields    a simple minimal knot is either reversible or fully amphicheiral .",
    "more precisely :    1 .",
    "all knots @xmath107 are strongly invertible .",
    "2 .   if @xmath108 is odd , then @xmath109 is strongly + amphicheiral : 3 .",
    "if @xmath47 is even and @xmath108 is even or if @xmath47 is odd and @xmath9 and @xmath48 even , then @xmath110 is periodic of order two .",
    "the @xmath111 curve by the involution invariant has a linking number with @xmath110 equal to @xmath47 .    by a result of @xcite and @xcite , and similarly to the lissajous knots ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , these symmetries yields properties on the arf invariant and alexander polynomial that are described in the section .",
    "section 3 leads to section 4 where we show the existence of knots that can not be realized as simple or iterated knots of minimal singularities .",
    "these are the negative amphichireal or chiral knots .",
    "a negative amphicheiral or chiral knot can not be the knot of a simple minimal or iterated minimal knot    the first candidate in the rolfsen classification is the knot @xmath112 which is the first negative amphicheiral knot , and @xmath113 which is the first chiral knot .",
    "we do not yet know if these chiral knots can be realized as cable knots of minimal singular knots .",
    "this question will be treated elsewhere .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the algebraic crossing number of the natural braid representation ( see section 1 ) of simple minimal knots",
    ". we will give an upperbound of this number .    with the help of knottheory and knotplot ,",
    "we describe in section 7 some examples of minimal knots with their minimal braid representation and decomposition into prime knots .",
    "this allows us to investigate the fibration of minimal knots .",
    "let us first recall a few definitions .",
    "k is fibered if @xmath114 is fibered over @xmath111 : there is a differentiable mapping @xmath115 which defines a fiber bundle ; the fiber @xmath116 is the interior of a compact orientable differentiable surface with boundary k.    ( notice that fibered knots have an algebraic characterization : the commutator of the knot group @xmath117 is finitely generated .",
    "@xcite ) knots of holomorphic curves singularities are always fibered ; if the surface is given locally by the equation @xmath118 , then the ( milnor ) fibration is simply given by @xmath119 restricted to a sphere of sufficiently small radius @xmath120 .",
    "thus all torus knots are fibered .",
    "the fibration yields a monodromy mapping @xmath57 and a gluing map @xmath88 where @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the fiber of the fibration , ie the seifert surface spanning @xmath16 .    the monodromy map gives a way to compute the alexander polynomial , another knot invariant : @xmath123 where @xmath124 .    in particular",
    "if the highest order term of @xmath125 is different from @xmath126 then the knot is can not be fibered .",
    "we construct some examples of minimal braids with three , four or five strands and identify them . in particular :    the knot @xmath127 ( see fig .",
    "13 ) is a prime knot which is not fibered and still is a minimal singularity knot ; the minimal surface is locally given by @xmath128    we conjecture that the simple knots @xmath107 with @xmath129 odd are fibered .",
    "we are grateful to harold rosenberg for introducing us to the problem of fibration of minimal singularities .",
    "we thank joan birman for her suggestions and dror bar natan for his help and diligency .",
    "at a branch point @xmath9 , a minimal surface @xmath130 still has a tangent plane @xmath131 which is a real plane in @xmath132 the ambiant space is thus split into @xmath131 and the normal plane @xmath133 .",

    "as @xmath11 tends to zero , this knot converges clearly to the equator of the corresponding 3-sphere @xmath139 hence @xmath16 can be equally viewed as a knot of the 3-sphere .",
