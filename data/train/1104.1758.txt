    "studies of the far - infrared ( fir ) and submillimetre emission of our own galaxy and external galaxies identify strong continuum emission from dust grains at a range of temperatures .",

    "2010 ; laboca on apex , siringo et al .  2009 ; or scuba-2 on the jcmt , holland et al .",
    "2006 ) are beginning to provide large far - infrared- and submillimetre - selected samples of luminous , high - redshift galaxies : submillimetre galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "these smgs represent a population of extremely luminous , but highly obscured , starbursts at @xmath315 , suggesting that obscured star formation is increasingly important in galaxies at higher redshifts ( e.g.   chapman et al",
    ".  2005 ; dole et al .  2006 ; wardlow et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "while the bulk of the luminosity of smgs is contributed by their dust continuum emission , the gas phase in these galaxies also cools through strong emission lines arising from atomic and molecular transitions .",
    "the strongest of these are identified with atomic fine - structure transitions of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen and a number of molecules ( e.g.  co , hcn ) .",
    "these lines represent the main cooling routes for dense gas and hence they help regulate the star - formation processes .",
    "the most commonly studied of these lines are the rotational transitions of the co molecule , which are used as a tracer of the total h@xmath4 gas content of galaxies .",
    "however , there are several atomic lines which are far brighter than the co lines , e.g.  [ cii]158@xmath0 m or [ oi]63@xmath0 m .",
    "the [ cii ] line traces the cool interstellar medium and the surfaces of photo - dissociation regions , with [ oi ] arising from warmer and denser regions .",
    "photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) theory explains these strong lines as a result of the intense far - uv fields photo - dissociating co resulting in bright [ cii ] ( and [ oi ] ) emission ( hollenbach & tielens 1997 ) . as a result",
    "the [ cii ] line is viewed a promising probe of the interstellar medium in distant galaxies , providing an indicator of the h@xmath4 content and extent .",
    "indeed , studies of local galaxies have shown that up to @xmath5% of their bolometric output can be emitted in the [ cii]158@xmath0 m or [ oi]63@xmath0 m lines ( e.g.  stacey et al .  1991 ; brauher et al .  2008 ; fig .  1 ) .",
    "even stronger line contributions , @xmath634% ( madden et al .  1997 ; rubin et al .",
    "2009 ) , are seen within low metallicity , star - forming galaxies , suggesting that these lines may be even brighter in young galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "early searches for [ cii ] at high redshifts by necessity focused on the highest - redshift far - infrared sources , @xmath2 , where the [ cii ] line is shifted into the atmospheric windows at longer wavelengths in the submillimetre ( e.g.  ivison et al .  1998 ;",
    "maiolino et al .",
    "2005 , 2009 ; bolatto et al .  2008 ; wagg et al .",
    "most of these sources are powerful agn ( as well as being ultraluminous infrared galaxies , ulirgs , with l@xmath7l@xmath8 , where l@xmath9 is the 81000-@xmath0 m luminosity ) and it was found that their [ cii]158@xmath0 m lines were weak , relative to l@xmath9 .",
    "this seemed to demonstrate the same behaviour as seen in the local universe ( fig .  1 ) , where the [ cii ] emission is weak in ulirgs and in agn - dominated systems .",
    "a number of possible reasons have been proposed for this , including an enhanced contribution from continuum emission in dusty , high - ionisation regions ( e.g.  luhman et al .",
    "1998 , 2003 ) . however , more recent observations of [ cii ] in star - formation dominated galaxies at high redshifts ( hailey - dunsheath et al .  2010 ; ivison et al .  2010a ; stacey et al .  2010 ;",
    "valtchanov et al .",
    "2011 ) , all of which are ulirgs , has shown that their [ cii ] emission is as bright as lower - luminosity galaxies at low redshifts , l@xmath10}/$]l@xmath110.11% ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this has been interpreted as due to the more widely distributed star - formation activity within these systems , in contrast to the compact nuclear starbursts seen in low - redshift ulirgs ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "the strength of [ cii ] and other atomic lines underlines their potential for studying the star formation and the physical properties of the interstellar medium in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "such strong emission lines may make significant contributions to the broad - band fluxes of these sources at redshifts where the lines fall in the relevant filters .",
    "indeed , seaquist et al .  ( 2004 ) show this effect in local fir - bright galaxies , where co(32 ) emission typically contributes 25% of the 850-@xmath0 m flux density .",
    "equally , strong atomic lines may influence the detectability of high - redshift smgs , as well as less - obscured galaxies , in broad - band imaging surveys .",
    "emission lines would similarly bias the properties derived from the broad - band spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of these systems . in this letter",

    "the observed [ cii ] line in this source contributes 0.27% of the l@xmath9 and along with other strong lines may make a significant contribution to broad - band fluxes at certain redshifts ( to better illustrate this , the inset shows the same sed around the dust peak , with a linear flux scaling ) .",
    "we also indicate the observed - frame pass - bands for the _ herschel _ pacs ( 160@xmath0 m ) and spire ( 250 , 350 , 500@xmath0 m ) , scuba-2 ( 450 , 850@xmath0 m ) and laboca ( 870@xmath0 m ) filters .",
    "as an illustration of the effects of line contamination on the broad - band fluxes of high - redshift smgs we redshift our template sed and at each redshift we find the fluxes which would be observed in the _ herschel _ 160- , 250- , 350- and 500-@xmath0 m bands , and the 450- and 850-@xmath0 m scuba-2 bands ( the latter matching the laboca 870-@xmath0 m filter ) . in fig .  3 we plot the fractional increase in these fluxes as a function of redshift for the smmj2135@xmath160102 sed , compared to a line - free sed .",
    "this figure demonstrates that even for relatively weak - lined seds there can be moderate variations in the expected fluxes , 510% , for many pass - bands at @xmath30 .",
    "these line contributions are comparable to the absolute flux calibration uncertainty of typical submillimetre maps ( e.g.  weiss et al .",
    "2009 ) and the residual errors in source fluxes after correcting for confusion effects in these low - resolution maps ( so - called flux boosting , coppin et al .",
    "2006 ) , although unlike these two sources of flux error the line contamination is redshift dependent .",
    "however , given that we already know of examples of high - redshift sources with stronger lines than our template sed ( fig .",
    "1 ) , there is the potential for even larger variations .",
    "as an example we re - normalise the atomic lines in our template sed so that [ cii]158@xmath0 m corresponds to 1% of the bolometric emission and recalculate their contribution to the broad - band fluxes .",
    "we find that for such strong - lined emitters the emission lines can boost the broad - band fluxes by @xmath3140% or greater ( as shown by the right - hand scale in fig .  3 ) .",
    "such variation in the apparent flux of sources due to emission lines falling in the pass - band have two obvious consequences : i ) the presence of lines in only a subset of pass - bands may result in unusual colours for some combinations of filters at certain redshifts ; ii ) the visibility of strong - lined sources at particular redshifts is enhanced , resulting in their over - representation in flux - limited samples .",

    "the influence of the [ cii]158@xmath0 m line can be seen in the 250- , 350- , 500- and 850-@xmath0 m bands at @xmath320.6 , 1.2 , 2.2 and 4.4 respectively with a contribution to the broad - band fluxes of 510% .",
    "note that these contributions are based on a [ cii ] line comprising 0.27% of the galaxy s l@xmath9 .",
    "the line contributions will scale linearly with the line to far - infrared luminosity ratio , so sources with l@xmath22}/$]l@xmath33% ( fig .",
    "1 ) will have contributions @xmath34 larger , @xmath3140% , corresponding to the right - hand flux scale .",
    "we caution that the contributions for the higher redshift sources in the shorter wavelength filters ( e.g.  at @xmath35 and @xmath36 at 250 and 350@xmath0 m respectively ) are based on predicted , rather than observed , line fluxes .    to show the influence of line contamination on properties derived from the broad - band photometry we look at the effect of including emission lines on the dust temperature and luminosity estimates .",
    "we fit the fluxes from our redshifted template sed , with and without emission lines , with a modified black body with @xmath37 at the known redshift and determine the characteristic temperature , t@xmath38 , and far - infrared luminosity , l@xmath9 . using the smmj2135@xmath160105 sed we find negligible effects on the derived temperatures and luminosities , @xmath39k and @xmath40% respectively , when complete , high - quality photometric data is available .",
    "however , sources with stronger lines may suffer more significant biases , e.g.  @xmath41% in luminosity .",
    "moreover , the increased flux in the line - contaminated pass - bands , and hence the apparently higher significance of the detections in these pass - bands coupled with incomplete photometric coverage , may lead to even larger discrepancies .",
    "such effects would contribute to the increased scatter in relationships such as the far - infrared  radio correlation at high redshifts ( ivison et al .",

    "binning these data up in @xmath43 redshift bins we see little variation in the median 850-@xmath0 m flux of the smgs with redshift out to @xmath35 .",

    "below @xmath35 there is little variation in the median flux as a function of redshift and we illustrate this by plotting the median flux of smgs in this redshift range and their 1-@xmath46 dispersion as a grey bar . in contrast , there is a suggestion that the typical flux of smgs at @xmath47 may be higher , which may reflect the contribution of [ cii ] to their broad - band fluxes .",

    "unlike these other factors the line contamination has a redshift dependency and as we show , by comparing the flux ",
    "redshift and redshift distributions for 850-@xmath0 m surveys to simple models with and without emission lines , the presence of emission lines will lead to an excess of bright sources at @xmath565 , which can be observationally tested with forthcoming surveys . of course the most direct route to test the importance of line emission in continuum surveys for smgs is to measure the strength of the lines falling in the selection pass - band for a particular source .",
    "the broad frequency coverage and high sensitivity of alma mean that it should be easy to do so in future .",

    "<S> several of these lines , e.g.  [ cii]158@xmath0 m , have been found to be very bright in some high - redshift galaxies , with fluxes of @xmath10.11% of the total far - infrared luminosity , and may be even brighter in certain populations at high redshifts . at redshifts where these lines fall in instrument pass - bands they can significantly increase the broad - band flux measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the contributions from line emission could boost the apparent broad - band flux by @xmath12040% in the _ herschel _ and scuba-2 bands . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the steep source counts in the submillimetre and far - infrared bands , line contamination has potentially significant consequences for the properties of sources detected in flux - limited continuum surveys , biasing the derived redshift distributions and bolometric luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is possible that some @xmath2 sources found in 850-@xmath0 m surveys are being identified in part due to line contamination from strong [ cii ] emission . </S>",
    "<S> these biases may be even stronger for less - luminous and lower - metallicity populations at high redshifts which are observable with alma and which may have even stronger line - to - continuum ratios .    </S>",
