    "the top quark , discovered 1995 at fermilab , is special among the quarks due to its large mass : its lifetime is shorter than the characteristic hadronization time scale and therefore top bound states do not have time to form . from a calculational point of view",
    "this allows an immediate application of perturbation theory to top physics . up to now",
    "top quarks have only been produced in pairs through the strong interaction . with the upcoming run ii at the tevatron and later with lhc one expects to produce a top quark also through an electroweak @xmath0-vertex .",
    "the principal production mechanisms for single top production are flavour excitation , w - gluon fusion , s - channel production and associated w - production .",

    "in addition , a discovery of non - standard charged - current top couplings might give a hint on new physics .",
    "since the electroweak decay of the top quark proceeds so rapidly before any hadronization effects can take place , the decay products of the top quark are correlated with the top quark spin . of particular importance",
    "will be the semileptonic decay @xmath10 , since a detector signal corresponding to hadronic top decays will suffer from large qcd backgrounds .",
    "single top production , in which a top quark is produced through a left - handed interaction , offers therefore an opportunity for polarisation studies .",
    "due to the short lifetime of the top quark , production and decay of a top quark should be considered together and the relevant processes at the parton level are for example @xmath11 for flavour excitation or @xmath12 for w - gluon fusion . here",
    "it is understood that we may replace the @xmath13-quark pair by @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath16 . of course most diagrams contributing to the two processes above",
    "do not contain a top quark at all .",
    "we performed a full leading - order calculation @xcite and compared the results to the top narrow width approximation , to which only diagrams with an intermediate top quark contribute .",
    "the top narrow width approximation significantly reduces the number of diagrams .",
    "our results for the tevatron are shown in table  [ num_res1 ] .",
    "the first column gives the results from the full calculation , in the second column we required in addition that the decay products of the top reconstruct to within @xmath17 to the top quark mass and the third column gives the results for the narrow width approximation .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for w - gluon fusion we required three jets , two of them @xmath5-tagged , for flavour - excitation two jets with one @xmath5-tag and for the s - channel process we required two @xmath5-tagged jets .",
    "jets were defined by the hadronic @xmath18-algorithm @xcite .",
    "this exclusive signal definition allows us to distinguish the various processes . from table",
    "[ num_res1 ] we see that the narrow width approximation describes the cross section very well for w - gluon fusion and flavour excitation .",
    "the approximation is less satisfactory for the s - channel process . here",
    "non - resonant terms seem to give a more sizeable contribution .",
    "we obtained similar results for the lhc .",
    "a leading - order calculation gives a rough description of the process under consideration , but to reduce ambiguities due to the choice of renormalization or factorisation scales a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation is required .",
    "furthermore , if jets are defined an nlo - calculation models more accurately the internal structure of a jet . qcd corrections to the s - channel process and flavour excitation have been considered in @xcite .",
    "the calculation of qcd correction to w - gluon fusion is in progress @xcite",
    ". this calculation should give a more reliable prediction on the @xmath19-spectrum of the @xmath7-jet .",
    "since the top narrow width approximation works well for w - gluon fusion , it is sufficient to calculate qcd corrections in this narrow width approximation .",
    "this simplifies the task considerably .",
    "the calculation of the relevant loop amplitudes can in principle be done entirely with conventional methods : one approach could be to calculate 2 a_born^a_loop and to use the passarino - veltman algorithm for the reduction of tensor integrals @xcite .",
    "one uses further the t hooft - veltman prescription @xcite for @xmath20 , or , more efficiently , the reformulation according to s. larin @xcite .",
    "observables depending on spins can be treated within the spin density matrix formalism .",
    "this solves the problem of calculating the one - loop amplitudes in principal , but leads in practice to complicated expressions .",
    "a more efficient approach is to calculate helicity amplitudes and to square them numerically .",
    "here the complexity grows linearly with the number of diagrams as opposed to a quadratic increase within the conventional approach .",
    "the calculation of spin - dependent quantities is trivial , since helicity amplitudes carry the complete spin information .",
    "efficient algorithm for the reduction of tensor loop integrals rely on fierz and schouten identities and `` four - dimensional '' regularization schemes like dimensional reduction @xcite or the fdh - scheme @xcite are therefore favoured .",
    "( of course these schemes are all variations of dimensional regularization . ) since weak interactions do not conserve parity , @xmath20 makes it appearance and one carefully has to avoid inconsistencies inherent in some of the four - dimensional schemes .",
    "we first review the spinor helicity method , before constructing a regularization scheme adapted to @xmath20 , and comment finally on reduction algorithms for tensor integrals .",
    "the spinor helicity method expresses the polarisation vectors for external gluons of momentum @xmath21 in terms of two - component weyl spinors @xmath22 and @xmath23 as ^+_= , ^-_= .",
    "we have used the customary short - hand notation : @xmath24 , @xmath25 = \\l p_i + | p_j - \\r$ ] . here",
    "@xmath1 is an arbitrary light - like `` reference momentum '' .",
    "the dependence on the choice of @xmath1 drops out in gauge - invariant amplitudes . in the narrow width approximation",
    "we treat the massive top quark as an external state . for a massive spinor",
    "we use @xcite u(p , ) & = & ( p/ + m ) | q , +    of the massive fermion with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and @xmath1 is an arbitrary null vector with @xmath28 .",
    "it is easy to check that for these spinors the dirac equations , orthogonality and completeness relations hold",
    ". it will be advantageous to choose for @xmath1 the momentum of the charged lepton from the top decay .",
    "this choice simplifies the factorisation formula in the narrow width approximation .",
    "we first give an overview of existing dimensional regularization schemes .",
    "naive dimensional regularization uses \\ { ^ , ^ } = 2 g^ , & & \\ { ^ , _ 5 } = 0 . in the t hooft - veltman scheme",
    "@xcite a @xmath29-dimensional object is split between a four - dimensional part and a @xmath30-dimensional part : k_^(d ) = k_^(4 ) + k_^(-2 ) , & & _",
    "^(d ) = _ ^(4 ) + _ ^(-2 ) . here",
    "@xmath20 is defined as a generic four - dimensional object : _ 5 & = & ^ _",
    "^(4 ) _ ^(4 ) _",
    "^(4 ) . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath20 anticommutes with the first four dirac matrices , but commutes with the remaining ones : \\ { _ ^(4 ) , _ 5 } = 0 , & & = 0 .",
    "dimensional reduction @xcite continues the momenta to @xmath31 dimensions , but keeps spinors and vector fields in four dimensions .",
    "\\ { _ , _ } & = & 2 g_^(4 ) the @xmath29-dimensional metric tensor @xmath32 acts also as a projection operator : [ proj ] g_^(d ) g^(4 ) _ & = & g_^(d ) .",
    "naive dimensional regularization is not consistent in that scheme one can derive an equation like ( d-4 ) _ _ _ _ _ 5 & = & 0 . at @xmath33",
    "this equation permits the usual non - zero trace of @xmath20 with four other dirac matrices .",
    "however , for @xmath34 we conclude that the trace equals zero , and there is no smooth limit @xmath35 which reproduces the non - zero trace at @xmath33 .",
    "a similar equation can be derived in dimensional reduction , and dimensional reduction is therefore also algebraically inconsistent . here",
    "the inconsistency can be related to the projection property eq .",
    "the t hooft - veltman scheme is consistent .",
    "it should be mentioned that the t hooft - veltman scheme violates the ward identity for the axial current .",
    "this ward identity relates the following three diagrams :    ( 300,30)(0,20 ) ( 50,50)(90,70 ) ( 90,30)(50,50 ) ( 50,50)2 ( 10,50)(50,50)43 ( 80,65)(80,35)42 ( 150,50)(190,70 ) ( 190,30)(150,50 ) ( 150,50)2 ( 110,50)(150,50)43 ( 170,60)(10,210,30)44 ( 250,50)(290,70 ) ( 290,30)(250,50 ) ( 250,50)2 ( 210,50)(250,50)43 ( 270,40)(10,330,150)44    the violation of the ward identity is not a problem per se , but one has to keep in mind , that one needs an additional finite renormalization to restore the ward identity . to prove the ( algebraic ) consistency of a regularization scheme there are two approaches : the axiomatic approach of breitenlohner and maison @xcite takes @xmath36 , @xmath20 , @xmath37 etc . as a set of abstract symbols with a given set of relations and shows that these relations are self - consistent .",
    "the constructive approach of wilson and collins @xcite tries to find a represenation for each object in some ( finite or infinite - dimensional ) vector space . here",
    "algebraic consistency is ensured by the fact that one has an explicit representation . in the following",
    "we will follow the constructive approach @xcite .",
    "we start with a simple example .",
    "suppose , we are given the natural numbers @xmath38 together with the rule how to add two numbers and we are asked to construct or to define negative numbers .",
    "we can do that as follows : we consider pairs of natural numbers and call two pairs , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , equivalent , if p+l & = & k+q .",
    "an addition of these pairs is defined by @xmath41 .",
    "the set of equivalence classes yields then the integer numbers .",
    "for example , the inverse of the class of @xmath39 is the class of @xmath42 and the neutral element is given by the class of @xmath43 . given the set of integer numbers and a rule of multiplication we can repeat the exercise and construct the rational numbers .",
    "a further example would be to consider pairs @xmath44 and @xmath45 from a set of vector spaces @xmath46 and the equivalence relation v_i v_l & ~ & v_k v_j .",
    "this construction is quite general and forms the basis of what mathematicians call k - theory .",
    "more formally , let @xmath47 be an abelian semi - group .",
    "the @xmath48-functor associates to @xmath47 an abelian group @xmath49 , which is constructed as follows : consider the equivalence relation on the set - theoretical product @xmath50 .",
    "we put @xmath51 when there exists a @xmath52 such that a + b + p & = & a + b + p. then by definition @xmath53 .",
    "we are now in the position to start the construction of our regularization scheme .",
    "let @xmath54 be a set of finite - dimensional vector spaces .",
    "@xmath55 is an abelian semi - group with respect to the direct sum @xmath56 and the tensor product @xmath57 .",
    "we use grothendieck s k - functor twice to construct the corresponding abelian groups and define the rank of an quadruple @xmath58 $ ] by & = & . note the difference between the `` rank '' and the sum of dimensions @xmath59 .",
    "we can construct a set of quadruples such that their ranks form a dense subset of @xmath60 .",
    "this construction can be extended to the complex case .",
    "furthermore we can work with vector space of even dimension only .",
    "for a given quadruple of vector spaces of rank @xmath61 and whose sum of dimension is @xmath62 we define the integration by & & + & & _ 0^dk_^2 ( k_^2)^r/2-m-1 f(k^2+k_^2 ) the integration is well - defined , e.g. does not depend on the chosen representative . a different choice of a quadruple with the same rank @xmath61 would yield the same result .",
    "in addition the definition satisfies the usual properties of an integration , e.g. linearity d^rk ( a f_1 + b f_2 ) = a d^rk f_1 + b d^rk f_2 , translation invariance d^rk f(k+q ) = d^rk f(k ) , the scaling law d^rk f(k ) = ^-r d^rk f(k ) and the normalization d^rk ( -k^2 ) = ^r/2 . to define the dirac algebra we consider v_4 v_-2 , where @xmath63 is a four - dimensional vector space and @xmath64 a quadruple of rank @xmath65 and total dimension @xmath62 .",
    "we recall that we can work with vector spaces of even dimension only .",
    "we now have two options to define the dirac algebra .",
    "the first possibility is to define dirac matrices of dimensions @xmath66 over @xmath67 . with _ 5 & = & i ^0 ^1 ^2 ^3 this yields the t hooft - veltman scheme .",
    "the second option consists in defining dirac matrices of dimensions @xmath68 over @xmath63 and of dimensions @xmath69 over @xmath64 separately .",
    "this corresponds to a four - dimensional scheme . by construction",
    "this scheme is free of algebraic inconsistencies .",
    "basically the distinction between the rank and the sum of dimensions avoids the pitfall of dimensional reduction .",
    "the scheme is specified by a mapping of the feynman rules from @xmath63 to @xmath70 .",
    "the dirac algebra in the numerator can effectively be performed in four dimensions . for the loop momentum appearing in the numerator of loop integrals",
    "one has k/ k/ & = & k_(4 - 2)^2 - k_(-2)^2 the first term on the r.h.s can cancel a propagator , whereas the second term shifts effectively the rank of the loop integral from @xmath71 to @xmath72 . as in the t hooft - veltman scheme ,",
    "the four - dimensional scheme violates ward identities , which have to be restored by finite renormalizations .",
    "loop integrals may involve the loop momentum in the numerator . to reduce these tensor integrals to standard scalar integrals , several algorithm exists like the pasarino - veltman algorithm based on lorentz invariance @xcite , the feynman parameter space technique @xcite or the partial integration technique @xcite . these algorithm are general but have also some drawbacks : the first two introduce gram determinants in the denominator , whereas the last one might give rise to spurious poles in @xmath73 . for most practical applications more efficient algorithm exists . for the calculation of helicity amplitudes loop momenta",
    "are usually sandwiched between spinors .",
    "consider the example ^^ a tensor reduction according to passarino - veltman would result in long intermediate expressions , but rewriting ^^k_k _",
    "& = & ( k^2-m_1 ^ 2 ) + m_1 ^ 2 reduces the integral immediately .",
    "more systematically , one uses the fierz identity a+ | _",
    "c- | ^| d- = 2 cb , the schouten identity for spinors ab cd & = & ad cb + ac bd , as well as the schouten identity for four - vectors & & + & & v^a_= ^abcd ( , q_b , q_c , q_d ) .",
    "the algorithm proceeds in two steps : first one reduces tensor integrals to integrals with at most one power of the loop momentum in the numerator @xcite : if there at least two massless external legs , say @xmath74 and @xmath75 , one writes k/ & = & .",
    "the first two terms will cancel propagators , whereas a product of the last two terms can be rewritten as & & + & & - ( 2 p_1 p_2 ) k_(4 - 2)^2 + ( 2 p_1 p_2 ) k_(-2)^2 , + & & + & & , in a second step the remaining vector integrals are reduced @xcite . for pentagon or higher point integrals one forms first the traces",
