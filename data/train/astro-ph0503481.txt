    "elitzur ( 1976 ) suggests that the level inversion of these 1720  mhz snr masers is due to collisional excitation .",
    "the physical conditions suggested for the collisional pump ( @xmath3 , @xmath4  k , @xmath5 ) are observed to occur where a c - type ( non - dissociative ) shocked interface between the snr and an adjacent molecular cloud is moving transversely across the sky ( _ e.g_.  elitzur 1976 ; wardle 1999 ; lockett , gauthier , & elitzur 1999 ; see also frail et al .",

    "however , several masers may be `` blended '' into a single image feature in observations with angular resolution @xmath11  mas , prohibiting the determination of the intrinsic polarization state of the maser emission .",
    "observations using merlin ( approximately 100-milliarcsecond [ mas ] beam ) and the vlba ( approximately 10  mas beam ) are required in order to determine the intrinsic emission properties of oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers .    in a recent paper ( hoffman et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter paper i ) , we presented full - polarization merlin and vlba observations of approximately 30 oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers in w28 .",
    "the observations of w28 in paper i were shown to be relatively free from confusion due to spatial or spectral blending .",
    "thus , the intrinsic polarization properties of the maser emission were determined , indicating that : ( 1 ) the magnetic field orientation in the plane of the sky indicated by the linear polarization state of the maser emission is in good agreement with the magnetic field traced by synchrotron emission the snr limb and ( 2 ) direct observation of the zeeman splitting between the right- and left - circularly polarized maser lines in oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers is a reliable indicator of the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "however , it should be noted that although observations using merlin and the vlba provide a comprehensive empirical understanding of the maser emission , the interpretation of the results using existing theoretical models is relatively unconstrained ( _ e.g_.  paper i ; gray 2003 ) . in particular , the theoretical derivation of the angle @xmath12 between the line of sight and the magnetic field in the maser gas is not well constrained .",
    "the w44 snr also contains a large number of masers ( @xmath1325 ) compared with most oh - maser snr s , which typically contain only a few masers ( _ e.g_.  brogan et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter bfgt ) ; an observational study of the w44 masers should yield a statistically significant sampling of oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr maser polarization properties for comparison with the conclusions of paper i. w44 is a snr of diameter approximately 26  pc in the radiative phase of evolution ( _ e.g_.  chevalier 1999 ) .",

    "indeed , figure 1 shows an image of the synchrotron radiation from w44 with the positions of the oh ( 1720  mhz ) maser regions overlaid .",
    "the masers are observed across most of the face of w44 in contrast to the case of w28 ( c97 ) where the masers occur along the limb bordering the molecular cloud at the northeast of the snr .",
    "furthermore , the velocities of the masers in w44 lie within the range of approximately 3  km  s@xmath16  ( a few linewidths ) in contrast to the approximately 11  km  s@xmath16  ( @xmath17 linewidths ) over which the w28 masers are observed . the geometry and velocity structure of the w44 snr / molecular cloud interaction appears to have been shaped by the creation of a wind - blown cavity prior to the supernova explosion ( _ e.g_.  koo & heiles 1995 ) .",

    "since the estimated gain does not exceed the suggested maximum gain , we find these observations to be consistent with suggestions based on the collisional pump model ( see also  4.5.1 ) .",
    "the magnetic field in the masers has been measured using both resolved zeeman splitting between the rcp and lcp line profiles ( @xmath39 ) and fitting of stokes @xmath47 to the derivative of stokes @xmath29 ( @xmath52 ) .",

    "however , despite the good agreement between the derived parameters @xmath52 and @xmath39 , it is important to note that the theoretical models used to interpret the observations may not be appropriate . since theoretical investigations of maser polarization",
    "are usually based on @xmath87 or @xmath88 ( cf .",
    "elitzur 1996 ) , many of the theoretical models ( concerning both zeeman analysis and linear polarization analysis ) may not be applicable to these oh snr masers for which @xmath46 (  3.3 ; table [ circ ] ; see also paper i ) .    the sign and magnitude of the magnetic fields indicated by the current circular - polarization observations are consistent with previous observations of oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers .",

    "all of the w44 masers are fitted with a negative magnetic field indicating a magnetic field oriented toward the observer .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic field measured using the circular - polarization data , although uncertain by a factor of approximately three due to uncertainties in @xmath12 and the degree of saturation ( _ e.g_.  watson & wyld 2001 , hereafter ww01 ) , may be compared with theoretical suggestions about the strength of the magnetic field in shock - compressed molecular clouds . as discussed by bfgt ,",
    "bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) suggest @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the density in @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the shocked line width in km  s@xmath16 .",

    "the bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) model yields @xmath95  mg which is of the same order as the magnetic field magnitude estimated from the observed zeeman splitting ( @xmath96  mg ) .      in this section",
    "we compare the magnetic field direction indicated by the shock front and the magnetic field direction indicated by the linearly - polarized maser emission . using this comparison ,",
    "we discuss constraints on the magnetic field geometry within the masers .",
    "the magnetic field orientation in the snr may be probed directly using observations of the synchrotron continuum radiation .",
    "milne & dickel ( 1975 ) have observed the linear polarization of the synchrotron emission from w44 at both 5  ghz and 2.7  ghz at an angular resolution of 44 ( see also milne [ 1987 ] which contains a review of the observations by kundu & velusamy [ 1972 ] and dickel & milne [ 1976 ] )",
    ". using a dual - frequency analysis , they find the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) in the direction of the masers to be between 0 and @xmath97 @xmath98 and the depolarization to be negligibly small .",
    "based on these synchrotron observations , we conclude that the faraday rotation and depolarization affecting our maser measurements is small and need not be considered .",
    "milne and dickel also find the position angle of the plane - of - the - sky component of the magnetic field at the location of the masers to be approximately @xmath99 .",
    "the magnetic field orientation is uniform in direction for several arcminutes on every side of the maser region .",
    "based on the relative uniformity of the results of the arcminute - resolution synchrotron observations , we assume that the faraday rotation , depolarization , and magnetic field orientation do not change appreciably over the @xmath100 angular separation of the masers .    the coincidence of oh snr masers with shocked molecular gas is well established ( _",
    "e.g_.  frail & mitchell 1998 ) .",
    "as the shock forms and moves outward through the interstellar medium , the ambient galactic magnetic field is swept up and compressed .",
    "for example , balsara et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggest that the direction of the magnetic field in the shocked gas lies in a plane parallel to the shock .",
    "there is a good agreement between the orientation of the magnetic field inferred using images of the shocked co gas ( frail & mitchell 1998 ) and the position angle of the magnetic field measured from observations of the synchrotron radiation ( @xmath99 , milne & dickel 1975 ) .",
    "the position angle @xmath59 of the linearly - polarized emission from the oh masers in w44 ( table [ merpol ] ) is parallel to the position angle of the magnetic field apparent from both the co and synchrotron observations .",
    "the agreement between the orientation of the co shock front and the maser position angle is shown in figure [ co ] . from these comparisons , it is apparent that the position angle of the linear polarization of the maser is parallel to the plane - of - the - sky component of the magnetic field in the maser gas .    based on theoretical investigations , elitzur ( 1998 ) and",
    "watson and wyld ( ww01 ) , for example , suggest that the polarization fraction @xmath64 and the polarization angle @xmath59 of maser radiation depend strongly on @xmath12 , the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight . for masers viewed at an angle of @xmath101 ,",
    "these authors suggest that the linear polarization angle is parallel to the plane - of - the - sky component of the magnetic field permeating the maser gas . for masers viewed at an angle of @xmath102 ,",
    "the linear polarization angle is suggested to be perpendicular to the plane - of - the - sky component of the magnetic field .",
    "the oh masers in w44 appear to have a linear polarization parallel to the plane - of - the - sky component of the magnetic field in the snr shock , implying @xmath101 .",
    "in contrast , the oh masers in w28 appear to have a linear polarization perpendicular to the magnetic field of the snr shock ( paper i ) .",
    "the masers are observed to have @xmath103% ( table [ merpol ] ; see also paper i ; bfgt ) . for the case",
    "in which @xmath103% and in which @xmath59 is parallel to the plane - of - the - sky component of the magnetic field , watson and wyld ( ww01 ) , for example , suggest that @xmath104 .",
    "indeed , all observations of the linear polarization of oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers interpreted using the theories of ww01 and elitzur ( 1998 ) yield @xmath104 ( see bfgt ; paper i ) .",
    "thus , the w44 masers and w28 masers differ in the relative orientation of the maser polarization and the magnetic field , for which theoretical polarization models suggest @xmath102 in w28 and @xmath101 in w44 . however , since the fraction of linear polarized maser emission @xmath64 is comparable in both the w44 and w28 oh snr masers , @xmath12 must be approximately @xmath105 in both remnants .",
    "we consider the preponderance of the derived value @xmath104 to represent an uncomfortable level of coincidence in the theoretical interpretations .",
    "we plan to discuss this coincidence further in a future paper . also , observations with more favorable spectral resolution will more accurately determine line shape parameters , such as the deviation from gaussian ( watson et al .  2002 ) and the relative width of stokes @xmath29 and @xmath47 ( _ e.g_.  vlemmings et al .",
    "2002 ) , which are suggested to depend upon the degree of saturation of the masers and @xmath12 , the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic field .",
    "three separate tests indicate partial saturation of the masers .",
    "first , theoretical investigations indicate that a maser must be at least partially saturated in order to possess linear polarization , assuming no anisotropies in the pumping ( _ e.g_.  elitzur 1998 ; ww01 ) .",
    "the degree of linear polarization observed in the w28 and w44 masers ( @xmath103% ) is consistent with partial saturation ( paper i ) .",
    "second , the estimated gain of the masers , @xmath82 (  4.2 ) , is comparable to the maximum suggested gain for oh snr masers , consistent with the conclusion that the masers are partially saturated .",
    "third , watson et al .  (",
    "2002 ) suggest the line - shape parameters @xmath106 ( defined therein ) and kurtosis ( _ e.g_.  abramowitz & stegun 1972 ; press et al .",
    "2001 ) are dependent upon the saturation state of the maser amplification process .",
    "the deviations from gaussian line shape observed in the w44 maser profiles ( _ e.g_.  fig .",
    "[ e11_merlin_resid ] ) are similar to those observed for the w28 masers ( @xmath107 and a positive kurtosis ; note that paper i inaccurately described the kurtosis as negative ) . this result is consistent with partial saturation ( though it is also consistent with unsaturated masing ) .",
    "we intend to make a more quantitative analysis using the watson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) model in a future paper .      in paper",
    "i we presented the first observation of zeeman splitting in oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers to be resolved directly between the rr and ll line profiles .",
    "both the merlin and vlba observations of the w28 masers yield a resolved velocity difference between zeeman components . due to the relatively low flux density of the w44 masers ,",
    "only the merlin data in this paper indicate a difference between the rr and ll line centers ( table [ circ ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , for both the w44 and w28 observations , the zeeman effect has been directly resolved between the rr and ll polarizations .    a comparison of the magnetic field strength calculated from the rr and ll line separation ( @xmath39 ) and that calculated from the stokes - fitting method ( @xmath52 ) indicates , for both the w44 and w28 masers , that @xmath108 ( fig .  [ bcomp ] ) .",
    "for both the w28 and w44 masers , the ratio of line splitting to line width is @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath52 is expected to depend upon @xmath12 but @xmath39 is not , we conclude that their agreement indicates that either ( 1 ) the magnitude of the magnetic field fitted to the polarization observations does not depend as strongly on @xmath12 as is currently suggested in the theoretical literature ( _ e.g_.  ww01 ) or ( 2 ) the observed zeeman splitting in the masers ( @xmath46 ) renders models based upon @xmath88 inapplicable to these results .",
    "we plan to collect all polarization observations of oh snr masers into a future paper which addresses the appropriateness of the theoretical interpretations .",
    "using merlin , we have detected all but one of the oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers in w28 with intensity greater than 1  jy  beam@xmath16  as observed with the vla by claussen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . of the 10 merlin detections , we have detected two masers ( approximately 20% ) with the vlba+y1 , consistent with other vlbi detection rates of oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers ( h03 ; paper i ) . based on merlin data having a resolution of 200  mas and vlba data with a resolution of 15  mas ,",
    "the masers are measured to have deconvolved angular sizes of 50 to 350  mas ( 150 to 1000  au ) with compact cores 20  mas ( 60  au ) in size , consistent with theoretical expectation and previous observations .",
    "all of the imaging results for the oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers in w44 are consistent with theoretical expectation and previous observations . in general , oh ( 1720  mhz )",
    "snr masers which are not affected appreciably by interstellar scattering ( see yusef - zadeh et al .  1999a ; claussen et al .  2002 ) have similar sizes and angular morphologies ( paper i ; h03 ) .",
    "zeeman splitting is observed between the right- and left - circularly polarized maser lines , offering a direct measurement of the magnetic field in the maser gas .",
    "the strengths of the magnetic fields estimated from the circular - polarization observations ( @xmath15  mg ) are consistent with the magnetic field strengths suggested using models of shock - compressed molecular clouds . also , the position angle of the magnetic field measured using the linear polarization of the masers is in good agreement with both the orientation of the shock observed using molecular emission ( _ e.g_.  frail & mitchell 1998 ) , with the magnetic field orientation expected from the snr expansion ( _ e.g_.  balsara et al .",
    "2001 ) , and with the magnetic field orientation calculated from observations of the synchrotron emission ( _ e.g_.  dickel & milne 1975 ) .",
    "thus , the linear polarization angle of the w44 oh masers appears to be parallel to the snr magnetic field in contrast to the position angle of the linear polarization of the w28 oh masers ( paper i ) which was found to be perpendicular to the magnetic field in the snr .",
    "in addition , interpretation using existing theoretical models ( appropriate for @xmath88 although the masers have @xmath46 ) indicate that @xmath104 , as has been found for all other oh - snr - maser polarization observations .",
