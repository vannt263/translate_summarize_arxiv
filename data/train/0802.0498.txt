    "the bayesian approach to parametric model selection requires the specification of a prior probability distribution over the parameter space .",
    "the jeffreys prior , which is proportional to the square root of the determinant of the fisher information computed in the parameter space , has been shown to be the uniform prior over all _ distributions _ indexed by the parameters in a parametric family @xcite .",
    "geometrically , its integral over a region of the parameter space computes a volume that essentially measures the fraction of statistically distinguishable probability distributions within that region @xcite . in this interpretation , the jeffreys prior distribution @xmath0 where @xmath1 simply measures the fractional volume of the small element @xmath2 relative to total volume of the parametric manifold @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the fisher information on the parameter space @xmath5 and @xmath2 is the standard riemannian volume element on @xmath6 .",
    "the volume @xmath7 also appears in the minimum description length ( mdl ) approach to model selection @xcite , conceptually because it effectively measures how many different distributions are describable by different parameter choices .",
    "an important difficulty in applying the mdl approach to model selection occurs when the parameter space is noncompact and the volume @xmath7 diverges . in this case , from the bayesian perspective , a uniform prior on the parameter space does not exist , while from the mdl perspective the number of models that might be describable diverges , leading to problems with the definition of the description length .",
    "of course the parameter space can be cut off by hand , but unless the choice of cut - off is well founded , it can lead to artifacts in the comparison of different model families @xcite . unfortunately in many practical problems the parameter space _ is _ noncompact and @xmath7 diverges .",
    "for example , in astrophysics , the detection of exoplanets depends on a model of the light coming from the occluded star .",
    "this model will contain a non - compact direction representing the orbital period of the planet ",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . for examples from psychophysics see , e.g. , @xcite .    in this note",
    "we argue that merely specifying the experimental set - up  before the measurement of any actual data  influences the prior distribution on the parameter space .",
    "this occurs because , given the finite number of measurements in any experiment , many of the probability distributions indexed by a parametric manifold will be statistically indistinguishable . in cases where the parameter space is noncompact ,",
    "the uniform prior conditioned on the experimental setup can thus become well - defined . in the geometric language of @xcite , the volume that measures the number of probability distributions in the parametric family that are statistically distinguishable given a _",
    "finite _ number of measurements can be finite even if the parameter space is non - compact . in effect , specifying the experimental set - up can render the parameter space compact .",
    "our results illustrate how the choice of experimental set - up influences the measure on the parameter space of a model , thereby affecting which model is regarded as most ` correct ' . in section [ general - argument ]",
    "we briefly review the computation of posterior probabilities , and consider the effect of conditioning on the experimental set - up on the parameter space measure . in section [ sec :",
    "example ] we apply these considerations to a physical problem : the analysis of light - curves of stars with orbiting planets . in this example",
    "we see that the volume of the parameter space is rendered effectively finite after the experimental set - up is specified .",
    "[ general - argument ]      suppose one is interested in some physical phenomenon , and has made @xmath8 relevant measurements : @xmath9 .",
    "further suppose that there are two different parametric models , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , that aim to describe the phenomenon in question .",
    "the basic question to be answered is which of the two models is the better one , considering the experimental data @xmath12 .",
    "the probability - theoretic answer to this question is to compute the posterior probabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which we can write using the bayes rule as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the vector of variables parametrising @xmath10 , and @xmath17 is the volume form associated to the measure on the parameter space , which we will define shortly .",
    "a corresponding expression can also be written for @xmath14 .",
    "since we wish to compare @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we can ignore the common factor @xmath18 , and we will assume @xmath19 and drop this factor as well .",
    "thus the only remaining ingredient to be defined is the volume form @xmath17 ; we simply quote the result from @xcite : the volume form that gives equal weight to all statistically distinguishable distributions in the parametric family is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the _ fisher information matrix _ , defined as the second derivative of the kullback ",
    "leibler distance @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the integration measure over the sample space @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the distribution function associated to the values of the parameters @xmath27 .",
    "now we have defined everything needed to compute the posterior probabilities , and we illustrate the formalism by applying it to the analysis of light - curves .    using this , we can compute the fisher information matrix by computing the kullback ",
    "leibler distance between two nearby points and taylor expanding : @xmath28 on the third line , the terms linear in @xmath29 vanish , as exchanging the order of integration and derivation , the integral of @xmath29 will yield a constant 1 , which then differentiates to zero .      the measure ( [ measure ] ) is independent of the experimental data @xmath12 and is constructed under the assumption that the entire sample space can be measured by the observer .",
    "however , in real experiments , instrumental and design limitations only allow observation of some subset @xmath30 of the sample space .",
    "thus an observation either results in no detected outcome , or in a measurement @xmath31 .",
    "thus the effective predicted distribution of measured outcomes is not the @xmath32 , but rather @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "we will argue that if the models in the asymptotic regions of a noncompact parameter space differ in their predictions mostly outside the observable region @xmath30 , the fisher information for the effective distributions ( [ effdist ] ) can decay sufficiently quickly to render the volume @xmath35 finite . in this section",
    "we will give one set of sufficient conditions for this to happen and in sec .",
    "3 we will give a detailed example .    consider a model , specified by parameters @xmath36 , and a distribution @xmath37 , with @xmath38 .",
    "we will slightly simplify notation simply referring to the distribution as @xmath32 and understanding the implicit parameter dependence .",
    "let us use spherical coordinates in the parameter space @xmath6 with @xmath39 being the radial coordinate , i.e. @xmath40 . also consider an experimental set - up that can only make measurements inside some compact region @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the probability of no measurement being registered by this experiment is @xmath42 .",
    "our first assumption is a smoothness condition , so that inside the region @xmath30 the distribution does not fluctuate too much as one approaches the asymptotics of parameter space : @xmath43 where @xmath44 goes to zero as @xmath39 goes to infinity ; we will later specify the exact scaling needed .",
    "intuitively , this condition says that as the parameter @xmath45 , the models do not differ too much inside the observable part of the sample space @xmath30 .",
    "this allows us to estimate @xmath46 where vol@xmath47 denotes the volume of the compact region @xmath30 .",
    "secondly we assume that inside @xmath30 , the distributions @xmath32 do not decay too quickly as @xmath45 .",
    "intuitively , since any experiment will only measure a finite amount of data ( say @xmath8 points ) , if the probability of a single measurement lying inside @xmath30 is significantly less than @xmath48 , then the experimental set - up will not detect anything .",
    "thus we will require @xmath49 where again we will later specify the scaling of @xmath50 with @xmath39 .",
    "decays too quickly as @xmath45 , then the models in the asymptotic region of the parameter space make no measurable predictions for experiments designed with a finite number of measurements .",
    "the example in the sec .",
    "3 will illustrate such a scenario . ]    using these assumptions , we can establish an upper bound for the fisher information ( [ eq : fishertheor ] ) : @xmath51 thus the determinant of the fisher information scales as @xmath52 and for the integral @xmath7 to be finite one must have suppression stronger than @xmath53 .",
    "thus the integral converges if @xmath54 is suppressed more strongly than @xmath55 from the experimental set - up one can estimate how @xmath50 scales with @xmath39 , which then determines how @xmath44 needs to scale for the integral to converge .",
    "this is thus a sufficient condition for rendering the parameter space effectively finite .",
    "it is worth stressing that , following the above analysis , any method of deciding the validity of a model is impacted by the choice of the experiment in a completely computable way , and this should be taken into account when designing experiments .",
    "[ sec : example ]          consider a star orbited by a planet so that the planet periodically passes between the star and earth .",
    "the light output ( light - curve ) of such a star is a constant line , with a small periodic dip when the planet is eclipsing part of the star .",
    "one model for such a light - curve was proposed in @xcite as @xmath56 , \\label{eq : curve}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 an example light - curve is shown in figure [ fig : curve ] ; @xmath58 is the period of the planet ; @xmath59 is the duration of the transit , i.e. how long the planet eclipses the star ; @xmath60 is the depth of the dip in the curve ; @xmath61 is the total observed brightness of the star ; and @xmath62 is a phase parameter specifying when the planets transit occurs . finally , @xmath63 is a constant parameter specifying the sharpness of the edges of the light - curve , expected to be fairly large as the transition between transit / no - transit is relatively quick .",
    "the assumption @xmath64 greatly simplifies our analysis , and is not physically very restrictive .",
    "the parameter space for this model is clearly non - compact as @xmath58 can range to infinity .",
    "however , we will argue that the space is effectively rendered compact after the experimental set - up is specified . to be precise",

    ", the answer will differ by an @xmath69 factor , but will have the same dependence on @xmath70 .",
    "thus , @xmath59 will always be a small fraction of @xmath58 .     with an average distance @xmath71 .",
    "]    now we can write down the probability density for measuring values @xmath72 for the light - curve at times @xmath73 with the light - curve specified by parameters as @xmath74 where we have assumed that the uncertainty in each measurement is gaussian , and further we have chosen the standard deviation to be equal for all measurements for simplicity . using ( [ gauss ] ) in the formula ( [ eq : fishertheor ] ) , we see that the the integrals in the fisher information are gaussian in @xmath75 ; thus we can compute them analytically to get @xmath76 this is our key formula , and we shall spend the next subsection analysing its properties .",
    "[ finiteness ] we now wish to apply the general arguments of section [ general - argument ] to the exo - planet system .",
    "consider an experimental set - up that can barely measure two periods , and then consider shortening the experiment slightly so that only one dip is detected ; this is depicted in figure [ fig : curve ] . to be precise , the shorter set - up measures the beginning and end of a transit at @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 points in between , and @xmath80 points after the transit .",
    "the longer set - up makes measurements at the same times , and additionally at times @xmath81 and @xmath82 , detecting the second transit . in the next subsections",
    "we will show that @xmath83 , indicating that detecting the second dip is of fundamental importance to experimental design ; without the second dip the experimental set - up ca nt differentiate models with large enough @xmath58 .",
    "this renders the parameter space effectively finite , as an experiment can not differentiate between models that have period @xmath58 larger than the duration of the experiment .",
    "[ sec : estimate ] in this subsection we will give an estimate for the magnitude of the determinant of the fisher information , and show how it is affected by the inclusion of the second transit in the data .",
    "in subsequent subsections we will exactly compute the determinant for a few specific experimental set - ups .    from ( [ eq : fisher ] ) and the definition of a determinant",
    ", we see that in each term of the determinant each parameter @xmath85 appears exactly twice in the derivatives , i.e. each term is of the form @xmath86 as a rough estimate of the size the determinant , we investigate how large terms of this type can be .",
    "the derivatives are @xmath87 from ( [ eq : f ] ) we see that @xmath88 only when @xmath89 , again assuming large @xmath63 .",
    "this tells us that the measurements that contribute most to the fisher information are the ones on the edges of the dips ; for our current purposes it is sufficiently accurate .",
    "] , i.e. at times @xmath90 and @xmath82 in figure [ fig : curve ] .",
    "we write the condition @xmath91 as @xmath92 and note that the ratio of transit time to period is very small , @xmath93 .",
    "this gives us the solutions @xmath94 where @xmath79 is an integer indexing the number of the dip , with @xmath95 denoting the solitary dip if only one is present in the data .",
    "we wish to estimate the ratio of the determinants of the fisher information by an order of magnitude estimate @xmath96 where both the numerator and the denominator are of the form ( [ generic ] ) , and according to the argument above the maximal contributions come from the edge measurements . from ( [ dd]-[deta ] )",
    "we see that the derivatives with respect to @xmath97 and @xmath61 are all periodic at the edges : @xmath98 for @xmath99 , and thus will cancel in the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "it is crucial that @xmath100 , however , is not periodic due to the second term in ( [ dt ] ) . at the first dip , @xmath101 , we expand ( [ dt ] ) to find @xmath102 while at the second dip , @xmath103 , the contribution is @xmath104 ignoring signs that are irrelevant for this estimate .",
    "thus we see that the fisher information increases strongly as the second dip is included : @xmath105 where we ignored order one coefficients .",
    "this is an explicit example of how our arguments from section [ general - argument ] work for a realistic model : when an experimental set - up does not have the capability to detect two dips , it becomes impossible to determine the period , and consequently the fisher information is very small ( or vanishing ) compared to an experiment that is able to detect two dips and determine the period more accurately . for any given experiment of finite duration @xmath106",
    ", the fisher information will decline with @xmath58 when @xmath107 effectively rendering the parameter space compact .",
    "to verify our claim that the parameter space is really rendered compact we need to show that det @xmath109 strongly enough as @xmath58 is taken to infinity .",
    "it is easy enough to find the @xmath58-scaling of the derivatives ( [ dt]-[deta ] ) ; @xmath100 scales as @xmath110 , while the others stay finite in the large @xmath58 limit .",
    "thus , as seen from ( [ generic ] ) , the determinant will scale as @xmath111 which shows that that the parameter space measure vanishes fast enough for large @xmath58 to render the parameter space volume finite .",
    "[ sec : dets ] while the order of magnitude estimate of the previous subsection offers an intuitive reason as to why the fisher information decreases sharply when the number of peaks detected falls below two , it is still instructive to explicitly compute the determinant in a few experimental set - ups .",
    "[ [ detecting - two - dips ] ] detecting two dips : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    let us first consider the case @xmath113 from section [ finiteness ] , i.e. measurements at times indicated in figure [ fig : curve ] . using the derivatives ( [ dt]-[deta ] ) one can write down the fisher information matrix ( [ eq : fisher ] ) as @xmath114 where for brevity we defined @xmath115 in computing this matrix we used that @xmath116 for @xmath117 , which is true up to corrections of order @xmath118 , as seen from ( [ eq : f ] )",
    "; for this reason one does not need to specify the exact times of the @xmath79 measurements during the dip , or the @xmath80 measurements outside the dip , as up to @xmath118 corrections they all contribute equally .",
    "the determinant of the fisher information is simple , @xmath119 this result explains the subtlety referred to earlier : although measurements at the edges contribute the most to the fisher information , if one only has measurements at the edges ( @xmath120 ) the fisher information actually vanishes .",
    "physically this is easy to interpret , as only measuring the edges @xmath121 will yield four points lying on a line , and thus they can not be used to determine any information about the curve ; other data points are needed to ` anchor ' the data .    [ [ detecting - only - one - dip ] ] detecting only one dip : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    similarly one can compute the fisher information in the ` short ' experimental set - up , where measurements are made at the same times as before , except not at @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this yields @xmath122 and perhaps surprisingly the determinant vanishes : det@xmath123 , up to tiny @xmath118 corrections .",
    "this indicates that the estimate in section [ sec : estimate ] was an overestimate : terms in the determinant of @xmath124 are of the magnitude estimated , but the determinant is arranged in such a way that the terms cancel to a high accuracy , and the compactness of the parameter space is strengthened .",
    "our analysis has shown how the specification of an experimental design affects the measure on model parameter spaces in mdl model selection ( or equivalently the prior probability distribution on parameters in the bayesian approach ) .",
    "interestingly , the finite number of measurements within a bounded sample space in any practical experiment can effectively render a non - compact parameter space compact thereby leading to a well - defined prior distribution ( [ measure ] ) .",
    "our analysis could be turned around to design experiments to discriminate well between models in some chosen region of the parameter space by ensuring that the fisher information ( [ eq : fisher ] ) is large in the desired region .",
    "it would also be useful to determine general conditions under which experimental design effectively makes model parameter spaces compact , perhaps following the arguments of sec .  2 .",
