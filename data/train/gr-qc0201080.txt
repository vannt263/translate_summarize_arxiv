    "the effect of the proper angular momentum @xmath4 of a body of mass @xmath5 , assumed as source of the gravitational field , is accounted for , in general relativity , by the parameter @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the speed of light in vacuum , entering , e.g. , the kerr metric .",
    "it has the dimensions of a length and is of order @xmath8 .",
    "the other characteristic length is the schwarzschild radius @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the newtonian gravitational constant , which enters both schwarzschild and kerr metrics .",
    "traditionally , in almost all the applications of the kerr metric to the motion of test particles or electromagnetic waves in the space  time of a central spinning mass the square of @xmath0 , which is of order @xmath11 and enters the diagonal components of the metric tensor , is neglected .",
    "however , in a recent stimulating letter in ref . it is suggested that , instead , it would be better to account for it in view of possible experimental setups on the earth .",
    "indeed , at laboratory scale , while the effects due to @xmath12 , of order @xmath11 , are certainly negligible because of the smallness of the product @xmath13 , those due to @xmath3 , of order @xmath11 as well , could become interesting because , for certain symmetric geometries of the source body , it depends only on the fourth power of its radius @xmath14 and the square of its angular velocity @xmath15 .    in this paper",
    "we want to explore this scenario by working out the contributions of @xmath3 to two classical tests of general relativity : the deflection of the electromagnetic waves and the time delay .",
    "we will consider the motion of photons in the equatorial plane of a central rotating body at rest . in a number of papers these general relativistic effects",
    "have been worked out for various systems of gravitating bodies endowed with mass  monopole , spin  dipole and time  dependent mass and spin multipoles for different states of motions both of the source of electromagnetic waves and the observer by means of a variety of general mathematical approaches , but the influence of @xmath3 has never been considered",
    ".    a possible objection to the present calculations could be that they are based on the use of the kerr metric in representing the gravitational field of an extended object at the @xmath3 order .",
    "indeed , it should be reminded that , up to now , nobody has been successful in extending the kerr metric from the empty space to the interior of a body . in fact , the field of a real rotating body would be endowed of various multipolar mass moments , etc . and",
    "if we do not know what is the matter source , as in the case of the kerr metric , we do not know how to cope with them .",
    "then , one could wonder if , at the level of approximation considered , the kerr metric and the derived consequences have physical meaning . however ,",
    "notice that in ref .",
    "the author use the full kerr metric in deriving the general relativistic corrections of the sagnac effect . in ref .",
    "the kerr metric is used in order to sketch a possible earth based laboratory experiment aimed to testing gravitomagnetism at order @xmath0 . moreover ,",
    "recently some efforts are or will be directed ( m. mccallum , private communication , 2002 ) towards possible extensions of the kerr metric to various interior matter sources .",
    "many efforts have been dedicated to the construction of sources which could represent some plausible models of , e.g. , stars . in ref .",
    "the authors have tried to connect the external kerr metric to the multipolar structure of various types of stars assumed to be rigidly and slowly rotating .",
    "terms of greater than the second order in the angular velocity were neglected . in ref .",
    "a physically reasonable fluid source for the kerr metric has been obtained . for previous attempts to construct sources for the kerr metric see refs . .",
    "in ref . a general class of solutions of einstein s equations for a slowly rotating fluid source , with supporting internal pressure , is matched to the kerr metric up to and including first order terms in angular speed parameter .",
    "so , in this context , our calculations could be useful in order to give an idea of what could happen in this case and , more generally , if experiments testing different scenarios at order @xmath16 are realistically conceivable .    a possible subject for",
    "further analysis could be an investigation of the correspondence with the post ",
    "newtonian expansion at the @xmath17 level .",
    "at the first order in @xmath4 the post ",
    "newtonian expansion accounts for the angular momentum of the source in the off  diagonal components",
    "@xmath18 via a @xmath19 term . ]",
    "so , at a first glance , it could be guessed that the post ",
    "newtonian expansion should account for @xmath17 with a @xmath20 term which , instead , is absent in the kerr metric .",
    "indeed , as we will see , our effects depends only on @xmath3 .    recently , in ref .",
    "an approximated solution of the einstein field equations for a rotating , weakly gravitating body has been found .",
    "it seems promising because both external and internal metric tensors have been consistently found , together an appropriate source tensor .",
    "moreover , the mass and the angular momentum per unit mass are assumed to be such that the mass effects are negligible with respect to the rotation effects . as a consequence , only quadratic terms in the body s angular velocity has been retained .",
    "one main concern is that it is not clear if there is a real mass distribution able to generate the found source tensor .",
    "as can be seen , the subject seems to be rather open and , in the author s opinion , worth of investigation , at least in order to get some estimates of the orders of magnitude involved .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we will derive the geodesic motion of a test particle of mass @xmath21 in the equatorial plane of a rotating body . in section 3",
    "we will specialize it to the photons and will work out the deflection of electromagnetic waves due to @xmath3 . in section 4 its effect on the time delay is examined .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the obtained results and to possible applications to earth laboratory experimental scenarios .",
    "let us consider , for the sake of concreteness , a spherically symmetric rigid body of mass @xmath5 , radius @xmath14 and proper angular momentum @xmath4 directed along the @xmath22 axis of an asymptotically inertial frame @xmath23 whose origin is located at the center of mass of the body . by adopting , as usual , the coordinates |x^0 & = & ct , + x^1 & = & r , + x^2 & = & , + x^3 & = & ,  the components of the kerr metric tensor are |00 & = & 1- , + 11 & = & - , + 22 & = & -^2 , + 33 & = & -^2 , + 03 & = & a_g^2 , with |^2 & = & r^2+a_g^2 ^ 2 , + & = & r^2-r_s r+a_g^2 .",
    "for a spherical body spinning at angular velocity @xmath15 and with moment of inertia @xmath24 the characteristic length @xmath0 becomes a_g==.    it is important to note that neither the newtonian gravitational constant @xmath10 nor the mass @xmath5 are present in @xmath0 which is determined only by the geometrical and kinematical properties of the body .",
    "this is a feature which will turn out to be very relevant in proposing experiments at laboratory scale .    by putting |&= & + & = & , the line element for a test particle of mass @xmath21 moving in the space  time of the central body in its equatorial plane , i.e. at fixed @xmath25 ,",

    "let us write as ( ) ^2=(1-)()^2-()^2-r^2(1+^2+^2)+2r ( ) .    in view of an application to possible experimental scenarios at laboratory scale",
    ", it is very instructive to note that |^2&~ & + & ~ & + ^2&~ & + & ~ & + ^2&~&.this implies that , at laboratory scale , the terms with the square of the characteristic length @xmath0 may give not negligible contributions with respect to the other terms which are quite negligible because of the presence of @xmath13 and/or because they are of order @xmath27 , @xmath28 .    from , by keeping , in a first step , only terms of order @xmath11 ,",

    "it is possible to obtain @xmath35 .",

    "here we investigate the two relativistic effects worked out and examine the possibility of measure them in terrestrial experiments and the gravitomagnetic term of order @xmath54 are far larger than the terms due to @xmath3 and the approximations used until now are no longer valid .",

    "we have calculated the effect of the square of the parameter @xmath0 entering the kerr metric on the general relativistic deflection of electromagnetic waves and the time delay in the gravitational field of a central rotating source at rest .",
    "then , we have analysed those two effects in a possible experimental scenario in an earth based laboratory with a small spinning sphere . due to their extreme smallness , we have neglected the terms involving @xmath13 .",
    "the maximum attainable linear velocity @xmath63 m s@xmath58 , due to the effects of the centrifugal forces , puts severe upper constraints to the magnitude of @xmath0 in a laboratory experiment .",
    "the derived effects are to small to be detected .    the calculations performed here loose their validity in an astrophysical context because , in this case , neglecting the other terms proportional to @xmath13 with respect to @xmath3 is no more allowed .",
