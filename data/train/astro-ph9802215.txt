    "in a recent paper , padoan , nordlund , & jones ( 1997 ) claimed on theoretical grounds that the initial mass function ( imf ) should be a function of the local temperature @xmath7 of the original molecular clouds .",
    "padoan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) argued that dense star forming regions , such as those in starburst galaxies , should be warmer than sparser star forming regions .",
    "in fact , if the temperature dependence of the clouds is not drastically different from that of a blackbody , then @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the local mean luminosity once star formation has already started .",
    "padoan et al .",
    "claimed that starburst regions should therefore have a flatter imf and be more  top heavy .",
    "\" similar reasoning would imply that the imf in cooler regions of galaxies should favor low mass star formation and be steeper .    in support of their star formation model , padoan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) noted that for @xmath10 k , their models predict a top heavy imf similar to that found in the center of r136  ( malumuth & heap 1994 , brandl et al .",
    "1996 ) , the bright stellar cluster in 30 doradus .",
    "due to its proximity and the fact that it is the most massive h ii region in the local group , 30 doradus is perhaps the best star formation  laboratory \" accessible to us . however , the relaxation time in r136 may be less than its age ( campbell et al . 1992 ) , so dynamic friction may also contribute toward the r136 present - day mass function gradient .",
    "fortunately , many other avenues of testing padoan et al.s model exist .",
    "the o - star catalog of garmany , conti , & chiosi ( 1982 ) shows a flattening of the imf slope toward the galactic center ( cf humphreys & mcelroy 1984 ) .",
    "this data supports padoan et al.s model since higher surface brightness regions would , on the average , yield higher temperatures and flatter imfs . models which attempt to explain correlations between local surface brightness , color , line ratios , metallicity , and the star formation rate have assumed luminosity - dependent imfs ( e.g. , edmunds & phillipps 1989 ; phillipps , edmunds , & davies 1990 ) .",
    "several evolutionary models of inner regions of starburst galaxies assume low mass cutoffs or top heavy imfs ( e.g. , rieke et al .",
    "1980 ; augarde & lequeux 1985 ; doane & mathews 1993 ; doyon , joseph , & wright 1994 ) . finally , independent theoretical arguments supporting imf gradients range from models which are consistent with the simple form of the jeans expression for the typical stellar mass in solar units of @xmath11e.g . ; larson 1982 ; bodenheimer , tohline , & black 1980 ) to much more complicated models , such as the outflow - regulated model of adams & fatuzzo ( 1996 ) , which predicts @xmath12 , where @xmath13    if imfs are actually a function of @xmath14 or @xmath15 , there would several important astrophysical consequences .",
    "for instance , there would be a position - dependence in the mean mass to light ratio .",
    "this is due to the strong dependence of the mass to light ratio upon the imf . in r136 , this makes the mass density function @xmath16 much different from @xmath17malumuth & heap 1994 , brandl et al .",
    "1996 ) and complicates estimates of the total mass .",
    "padoan et al.s results indicate that similar effects might occur in spiral galaxies . if the luminosity of a star is taken as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 the jeans expression above would suggest the crude relation @xmath20 and yield @xmath21 .",
    "unfortunately , previous works have assumed that imfs are independent of time and position with , specifically , @xmath22 throughout a given spiral galaxy ( e.g. , van albada et al . 1985 ) . in this _ letter _ , surface mass densities of spiral galaxies are computed , for the first time , by explicitly accounting for the possible types of imf gradients that might exist if theories like those of padoan et al .",
    "are correct .",
    "since position - dependent measurements in r136 of both @xmath14 and the imf slope @xmath2 ( where @xmath23 is the number of stars per unit mass in solar units ) have already been made , computing the dependence of the r136 imf upon the local luminosity is straightforward .",
    "doing this will provide a useful starting point in obtaining a crude yet quantitative estimate of the possible types of imf gradients that might generally exist in all galaxies including the milky way .",
    "table 1 summarizes brandl et al.s ( 1996 ) results for the imf based upon high resolution 5-color photometry of the stars in r136 estimated to be between 2.5 and 3.5 myrs years old .",
    "the right - most entry of table 1 shows the results of performing the coordinate transformation between @xmath24 and @xmath9 using figure 15 of hunter et al .",
    "though brandl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) did not make explicit measurements of the upper and lower stellar mass cutoffs @xmath25 and @xmath26 to the power - law approximation of the imf , table 1 includes estimates of their dependences upon the local surface brightness .",
    "the lower mass limits were obtained from the peaks of brandl et al.s mass functions , while the upper limits were taken from the highest masses observed per radius bin . both @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "are found to decrease by @xmath29 with each successive increase in radius .",
    "brandl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) performed completeness corrections , so the depletion of low mass stars in all but the outer regions of r136 is presumably real .",
    "the results of performing a linear fit of the imf parameters of r136 to @xmath30 are shown in columns 2 - 7 of table 2 as model a. uncertainties of parameters calculated from more than two radius bins are shown in parenthesis .",
    "the imf gradient of model a implies a surface mass density that is different from what would be obtained were the mass to light ratio constant . the surface mass density for model a , if scaled according to the surface luminosity function suspected for the galaxy , is shown in the top panel of figure 1 .",
    "the disk scale length @xmath31 kpc and solar galactocentric radius @xmath32 kpc were taken from kuijken & gilmore s ( 1989a ) model of the galaxy .",
    "for simplicity , @xmath9 at a given radius was assumed to be constant throughout a disk thickness of 575 pc .",
    "the surface brightness was normalized to be @xmath33pc@xmath34 at @xmath35 , which results in @xmath36pc@xmath6 . for each radius bin",
    ", the imf was obtained from @xmath14 and the coefficients shown in table 2 for model a. this imf was converted to present day mass and luminosity functions by assuming ( purely for simplicity ) a constant star formation rate for the past @xmath37 yrs .",
    "the main sequence lifetime - luminosity - mass relationships used to obtain the mass to light ratio as a function of the imf were obtained from logarithmic - linear interpolation of @xmath38 models published by schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for @xmath39 overshooting of the @xmath40 stars , and standard mass loss rates . for @xmath41 ,  and @xmath42 were assumed .",
    "the surface densities both of model a and of the constant mass to light ratio model fall off exponentially with increasing radius .",
    "the effective scale length of model a is @xmath43 kpc , which is @xmath44 times larger than that of the surface brightness function .",
    "this increase in the scale length is a result of the fraction of low mass stars ( and the mass to light ratio ) increasing with radius .    from the surface density , other dynamical properties of the galaxy",
    "can also be calculated .",
    "the circular velocity ( i.e. , the rotation curve ) corresponding to the surface density of model a is shown in the second panel of .",
    "the parameters for the bulge , spheroid , and halo were taken from table 1 and figure 5 of kuijken & gilmore s ( 1989a ) model of the galaxy . to avoid a divergent and unphysical total mass , the additional assumption that all components of the galaxy terminate at an arbitrarily - selected maximum radius of 35.0 kpc was also made . for model a",
    ", this results in a total mass of the halo , bulge / spheroid , and disk of , respectively , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . in comparison ,",
    "the integrated disk mass of the @xmath47 model is only @xmath48 and increases much faster with radius . for simplicity",
    ", the surface mass density of stellar remnants and gas was assumed throughout the disk to be 1/3 that of the stars . because the halo dominates the mass distribution ,",
    "the circular velocity curve ( solid line ) is nearly flat . without the halo ,",
    "the circular velocity curve falls from 185 km s@xmath49 at @xmath50 kpc to 124 km s@xmath49 at @xmath51 kpc .",
    "though the surface density of model a corrected for imf gradients is different from that previously obtained for spiral galaxies , figure 1 shows that the change is not enough to dramatically affect the dynamical properties of the disk , such as the circular velocity curve .",
    "the imf of model a is very negative at all radii , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 this occurs even though r136@xmath54 spatially - averaged imf is typical and its imf gradient is small only because it has a luminosity density that is @xmath55 times higher than typical regions of spiral galaxies . for comparison , miller & scalo ( 1979 )",
    "obtained much higher values of @xmath56 and -2.3 for , respectively , @xmath57 and @xmath58 this suggests that r136 s imf is correlated with @xmath14 in a somewhat different way than the correlation that might exist in the milky way .",
    "in retrospect , this should not be surprising because r136 is much different than a spiral galaxy .",
    "the bright , early - type stars in spiral galaxies are generally confined to relatively narrow galactocentric radii near that of their initial birth sites . in contrast , stars in elliptical galaxies similar to r136 undergo substantial mixing due to their highly eccentric orbits .",
    "therefore , the form of the imf in spirals could be different than that in r136 .",
    "for this reason , other models were also considered .",
    "model b was constructed in order to help answer the question of just how necessary the dark halo is for circular velocity curves to be flat .",
    "the imf gradient @xmath59 was adjusted to minimize the curvature of the outer circular velocity curve , while @xmath60 was adjusted such that the rotation velocity was @xmath61 km s@xmath49 . for simplicity ,",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath26 were fixed .",
    "the middle plot of figure 1 shows that the circular velocity curve of model b is surprisingly flat throughout most of the outer regions of the disk before the halo component is included .",
    "the total disk mass for model b is @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , which is 7.3 times larger than the @xmath47 model .",
    "the value of @xmath59 for model b is 0.42 .",
    "this is @xmath65 higher than the imf gradient in r136 .",
    "the change within the milky way of @xmath2 measured by garmany et al .",
    "( 1982 ) between the inner and outer semicircular regions of radius 2.5 kpc surrounding the sun was -0.8 , which for a disk scale length of @xmath31 kpc corresponds to @xmath66log_e_@xmath67  kpc)=3.9 .",
    "this is much higher than the value in model b. thus the imf gradient of model b is well within empirical upper limits .",
    "however , there are at least five potential problems with the halo - less form of model b : @xmath68 in the adopted solar vicinity @xmath69 kpc ) , the surface density is @xmath70pc@xmath71 .",
    "this is an unacceptable 15 standard deviations higher than the local value of @xmath72pc@xmath34 measured by kuijken & gilmore ( 1989b ) .",
    "the corresponding mass to light ratio is @xmath73 .",
    "this is @xmath74 higher than the local value adopted in standard texts such as binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) .",
    "similarly , the imf slope at this radius is @xmath75 also , for the low mass @xmath76 stars , this value is incompatible with miller & scalo s ( 1979 ) result of @xmath77 mestelian disks , which are similar to model b , are commonly thought to be unstable to bar formation .",
    "the toomre instability parameter @xmath78 is @xmath79 , where @xmath80 km s@xmath49 kpc@xmath49 is the epicycle frequency and @xmath81 is the mass - weighted stellar velocity dispersion ( toomre 1974 ) .",
    "published estimates are @xmath82 in the solar vicinity . because stellar velocity dispersions are empirically observed to decrease with mass even for stars with lifetimes greater than the age of the galaxy , estimates of @xmath83 are sensitive to @xmath62 .",
    "wielen ( 1977 ) obtained @xmath84 km s@xmath49 for @xmath85  k and m dwarfs , which implies @xmath86 for model b. this lower limit is low enough to sustain spiral arm structure which numerical simulations show would rapidly dissipate otherwise .",
    "however , it is too near unity to prevent the growth of substantial arm / interarm stellar mass density contrasts .",
    "though such mass contrasts are now known to exist in normal spirals ( e.g. , rix & zaritsky 1995 , gonzlez & graham 1996 ) , they are not accounted for in model b. incidentally , the halo component does not necessarily affect this instability ( sellwood @xmath87 the circular velocity curve at @xmath88 kpc is not precisely flat , but actually rises before attaining a nearly keplerian fall off .",
    "this is the result of the non - spherical potential . @xmath89",
    "the circular velocity drops below 200 km s@xmath49 in the inner regions of the disk .",
    "this result is expected . for model",
    "b , the mass to light ratio is @xmath90 . if _ 1=[(m_u / m_l)_10_e_]^-1 , which model b obeys to within @xmath91 , the mass to light ratio would scale as @xmath92 .",
    "this in turn would imply a disk surface density that is relatively constant .",
    "the circular velocities of such disks increase monotonically with @xmath93 and are zero at @xmath94 this problem with low inner disk velocities is probably not serious because circular velocity curves are frequently compatible even with constant mass to light ratio , halo - less models throughout their entire optically - bright regions ( e.g. , kent 1986 ) . furthermore ,",
    "flatter , halo - less velocity curves could probably be attained by including the following : galaxy parameters slightly different than those of kuijken & gilmore ( 1989a ) , a ( more realistic@xmath95-normal imf ( miller & scalo 1979 ) , expected spatial dependence in remnant and gas mass fractions , and variations of @xmath62 or @xmath26 with @xmath14 . for instance , the velocity dip is better masked by the bulge if bahcall & soniera s ( 1984 ) smaller disk scale length of 3.5 kpc is assumed .",
    "@xmath96 the imf gradient of model b appears to be too _ small _ to be compatible with the measurement of garmany et al .",
    "equation ( [ 2 ] ) suggests that this discrepancy would be less if a smaller @xmath97 ratio had been employed .",
    "of the above potential problems , only the first two appear to be significant at this time .",
    "both can be overcome by taking into account the arm / interarm density contrasts observed in spiral galaxies ; model c was constructed to be similar to model b , but has an azimuthally - averaged light and mass density that is 3.25 times greater than the interarm values in which the sun presumably resides .",
    "the circular velocity curve of model c , shown in the lower panel of figure 1 , is slightly higher but otherwise similar to that of model b. however , the solar - vicinity disk surface density is only @xmath98pc@xmath71 .",
    "this is a much more reasonable 1.6 standard deviations above the value determined by kuijken & gilmore ( 1989b ) and is actually lower than bahcall & soniera s ( 1984 ) value of @xmath99pc@xmath71 .",
    "a direct scaling of r136 s imf to the galaxy does not dramatically alter the circular velocity curve .",
    "however , models b and c , with their higher yet modest imf gradients , have nearly flat @xmath100 km s@xmath49 circular velocity curves only before the traditional dark halo component is included .",
    "it is interesting to note that if one assumes that these types of models and their @xmath101-fold mass enhancements are representative of most galaxies , that the fiducial stellar contribution towards the closure density is @xmath102e.g . , peebles 1993 ) before accounting for imf gradients , that the cosmological constant is zero , and that there is no hot dark matter , one would obtain @xmath103 , where the closure fraction due to all gas including hot plasma in galactic clusters is @xmath104@xmath105mulchaey et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "current models of galactic evolution ( e.g. , worthey 1994 , de jong 1996 ) do not account for imfs that might vary with time and position via the temperature . this is despite prior warnings that the imf probably has important dependences upon time and position ( e.g. , mihalas & binney 1978 ) . in light of the above results , accounting for imfs with such dependences",
    "may be necessary even to obtain results that are only accurate to first order .",
    "accounting for these dependences may , for relatively obvious reasons , clarify our understanding of several astrophysical phenomena including the g - dwarf problem , intrinsic ( as a function of radius ) and extrinsic ( as a function of galactic morphology ) metallicity and color gradients , and the tully - fisher relation .",
