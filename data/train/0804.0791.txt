    "it is well known that a real scalar field under the influence of certain nonlinear potentials supports long - lived , spatially - localized , time - dependent configurations known as oscillons @xcite .",
    "even though there are no topological or nontopological conserved charges associated with such objects , they exhibit remarkably long lifetimes , far exceeding naive estimates from linear approximations to the theory @xcite . this property has prompted much interest in studying oscillons in more detail in two @xcite and three @xcite spatial dimensions .",
    "structures with similar qualitative behavior have been observed in many different physical systems , from vibrating grains @xcite to acoustic oscillations in the sun @xcite .    in the past two years , it has been shown that oscillons are not limited to real scalar field models ; they have been found in 2d abelian - higgs models @xcite , and in the standard model @xcite .",
    "they may also play a role in cosmology @xcite , possibly having an impact on the dynamics of inflationary reheating , in symmetry - breaking transitions , and in false vacuum decay @xcite . in @xmath0 de sitter models , oscillons not only form from near - thermal initial conditions , but survive to retain approximately 50% of the total energy of the universe @xcite .",
    "so far , most oscillon properties , such as their energy , radius , and lifetime , have been obtained numerically .",
    "it has been shown that they have a near - constant energy and a near - periodic motion with frequency just below the mass of vacuum excitations @xcite . in spite of this progress ,",
    "it is fair to say that a proper analytical understanding of oscillons is still lacking .    in the present work",
    ", we will derive all physically relevant properties of scalar oscillons in quartic polynomial potentials .",
    "starting from a simple _ ansatz _ for their profile , we develop a _ nonperturbative _ analytical procedure to obtain their energy , lifetime , and minimum and maximum values of their frequency , radius , and core amplitude .",
    "we compare our analytical results to numerical simulations obtaining excellent agreement .",
    "we begin with the lagrangian for a @xmath1-dimensional , spherically - symmetric real scalar field in flat spacetime , @xmath2 where a dot denotes a time derivative , and @xmath3 .",
    "inspired by the numerical solutions , which show that an oscillon is well approximated by a gaussian undergoing near - periodic motion in its amplitude and with an effective radius oscillating with small amplitude about a mean value @xcite , we approximate the oscillon solution as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the displacement from the vacuum , @xmath6 .",
    "this approximation works particularly well in @xmath7 and @xmath8 , although it clearly fails to reproduce the oscillon s large @xmath9 behavior , where @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "since oscillons have been observed in a diversity of quartic polynomial potentials , we write @xmath11 as @xcite @xmath12 where the @xmath13 s are constants and @xmath14 is the vacuum energy . substituting eqs .",

    "it was noted in @xcite that the location of @xmath25 relative to the inflection points of @xmath21 is an accurate indicator of oscillon existence .",
    "this can be understood by noting that since the inflection points separate regions of opposite curvature in @xmath21 , the particular region probed by @xmath25 indicates the degree to which the field configuration experiences the stabilizing nonlinearities of the potential @xmath11 .",
    "following @xcite , we therefore adopt @xmath35 as an indicator of oscillon stability : increasingly negative(positive ) values lead to increased stability(instability ) . defining @xmath36 , @xmath37 in figure [ fig : energyi ] we show the ( parabolic ) level curve corresponding to @xmath38 .",

    "in addition to the above estimate for @xmath62 , we can derive an absolute lower bound for the oscillon energy .",

    "[ fig : energyi ] shows a critical energy , denoted @xmath65 , below which the energy curves do not probe the stable region . using the @xmath54 condition",

    "@xcite , we model the power spectrum of the oscillon core amplitude @xmath95 around its dominant frequency peak with a breit - wigner profile . since the power is proportional to the square of the amplitude of a given frequency component , we write @xmath96^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the square of the amplitude of the frequency component of @xmath95 with frequency @xmath28 , and @xmath98 is a constant to be determined .",
