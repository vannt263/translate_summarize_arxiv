    "mature planets on short - period orbits have energy budgets dominated by incoming radiation rather than internal heat .",
    "their atmospheric temperatures are therefore a function of both the absorption of incident stellar energy and its transport before re - emission into space .",
    "absorbed energy is solely a matter of incident stellar flux and the planet s bond albedo , @xmath0 .",
    "ironically , it is difficult to constrain bond albedo ( the fraction of stellar energy that is reflected ) through observations of reflected light . in order to convert an optical geometric albedo ( visible light reflected towards the illuminating star ) into a bond albedo",
    ", one must make assumptions about a planet s reflectance spectrum , scattering phase function , and spatial inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "bond albedo is more readily obtained from thermal measurements via energy balance .",
    "heat transport is more complicated , but tends to move energy from hot to cold : vertically upwards , from equator to pole ( for planets with small obliquity ) , from summer hemisphere to winter hemisphere ( for planets with non - zero obliquity ) , and from day to night ( for planets with slow rotation ) .",
    "due to strong tides , short - period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and slow rotation , and most are on circular orbits .",
    "hot jupiters on circular orbits are further expected to be tidally - locked , with one side permanently facing the host star and the other forever dark . as such",
    ", the atmosphere tends to transport heat from the dayside to the nightside , and from equatorial regions to the poles ( for a recent review of hot jupiter atmospheric dynamics , see * ? ? ?",
    "the atmospheric temperature of a planet is generally a function of four variables : longitude , latitude , pressure ( or height ) , and time .",
    "the time - dependence can usually be neglected for hot jupiters because they exhibit minimal weather @xcite .",
    "moreover , hot jupiters on circular orbits are expected to have a 3d fixed temperature structure with respect to the sub - stellar location , regardless of whether they are tidally locked @xcite .",
    "this motivates using a star - based coordinate system with the prime meridian facing the star , and allows us to use orbital phase as a proxy for longitude @xcite .",
    "the latitudinal temperature - dependence of a hot jupiter is inaccessible unless one can measure higher - order phase modulation @xcite or utilize occultation mapping @xcite . finally , the vertical temperature structure is in principle accessible via emission spectroscopy : wavelengths at which the atmosphere is relatively transparent will probe deeper layers , and vice versa .",
    "multi - wavelength thermal phase variations of a hot jupiter on a circular orbit therefore amount to brightness temperature measurements as a function of orbital phase and wavelength ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if one is solely interested in the global properties of the planet ",
    "namely bond albedo and day - to - night heat transport  then one can further simplify the problem by combining brightness temperatures at each orbital phase to obtain a bolometric flux , and hence an effective temperature _ at that phase_. note that solar system planets tend to have effective temperatures that are either uniform from any vantage point , or which vary based on the latitude of the observer due to imperfect poleward heat transport . for short - period exoplanets , on the other hand , the principal temperature gradient is between day and night , and dayside effective temperatures are often hundreds to thousands of degrees greater than their nightside counterparts .",
    "the final simplification we make is therefore to treat the planet as two horizontally isothermal hemispheres : a dayside and a nightside .",
    "the effective temperatures of each hemisphere are simply the weighted mean of the atmospheric temperatures on that side of the planet .",
    "@xcite used broadband infrared eclipse measurements of 24 hot jupiters to demonstrate that they have generally low bond albedos ( @xmath4 ) , and that the hottest planets have extremely low albedos and/or poor day  night heat transport efficiency , @xmath1 .",
    "it is possible to break the albedo - transport degeneracy by combining dayside thermal constraints with measurements of either nightside thermal emission or dayside reflected light .",
    "@xcite used an @xmath5 m eclipse depth and phase amplitude from the spitzer space telescope , combined with an optical eclipse measurement from the most satellite , to constrain the energy budget of hd  209458b ; they inferred a small bond albedo ( absorption of almost all light that shines on it ) and a high day - night heat transport efficiency ( nightside not much cooler than the dayside ) .",
    "@xcite used 8 infrared dayside and 2 mid - infrared nightside measurements to constrain the albedo and recirculation of wasp-12b ; they found the planet has a modest bond albedo ( @xmath6 ) and low heat transport efficiency ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "@xcite used phase - resolved emission spectroscopy taken with wfc3 from the hubble space telescope to map the atmospheric thermal structure of wasp-43b , finding low bond albedo ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) and no heat redistribution ( for recent reviews of exoplanet atmospheric observations , please see * ? ? ?",

    "our work is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : dayeb ] we use published eclipse depths at multiple infrared wavelengths to infer effective dayside temperatures for fifty planets , with more than twice the data as @xcite . in section  [ sec : globaleb ] we consider the subset of planets for which we can break the albedo - recirculation degeneracy .",
    "we first tackle the six planets with thermal measurements of both eclipses and phase variations ( section  [ sec : daynight ] ) , then the nine planets for which reflected light measurements are available in addition to dayside thermal constraints ( section  [ sec : dayalb ] ) .",
    "we discuss our results in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "inferring the effective dayside temperature of a planet requires combining eclipse depths at thermal wavelengths , which we define as those longward of @xmath10 m . we have updated the sample from @xcite , now including fifty planets with a minimum of two published infrared eclipse measurements ( additions include hat - p-19b , hat - p-20b , hat - p-32b , wasp-6b , wasp-26b , wasp-39b ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "c c +      thermal emission at different wavelengths originates from different layers in the planet s atmosphere , which have different temperatures .",
    "one can define a brightness temperature at each observed wavelength , @xmath11 : this is the temperature that a blackbody must have in order to emit at the same intensity as the planet .    inverting the planck function , we obtain the following expression for brightness temperature @xcite : @xmath12^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the relative intensity of the planet to that of its host star and @xmath14 is the stellar effective temperature , meaning we treat the star as a blackbody . for dayside measurements , @xmath13 is the ratio of eclipse depth to transit depth , @xmath15 , while for nightside measurements it is the ratio of nigthside flux to transit depth , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the phase variation amplitude",
    ". published data therefore allow us to compute dayside ( and , when appropriate , nightside ) brightness temperatures for each waveband in which a planet has been observed .",
    "the broadband emission spectra of most individual planets are consistent with isothermal atmospheres @xcite .",
    "it is possible , however , to construct an aggregate emission spectrum of all fifty planets in the hopes of revealing molecular absorption features too faint to detect in any individual planet s spectrum .    if some planets have temperature inversions while others do not , this type of averaging could actually wash out molecular signatures , which would appear in absorption for some planets and emission for others . however , the first and most statistically significant case of a hot jupiter temperature inversion @xcite has not been borne out by new measurements nor reanalysis of the originals @xcite .",
    "moreover , a systematic study of _ spitzer _ eclipse measurements found that they have not been as accurate as advertised @xcite , suggesting the temperature inversions reported in most hot jupiter atmospheres may simply be due to confirmation bias .    the aggregate emission spectrum for the fifty hot jupiters is shown in figure  [ fig : tb_spectrum ] .",
    "we normalize the brightness temperature spectrum of each planet in our sample , then determine the median and uncertainty on the mean at each wavelength .",
    "this `` stacking '' is only useful , however , at wavelengths for which there are observations of many planets ( currently 1.15 , 1.65 , 2.25 , 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 microns ) .",
    "there are no significant features in the average spectrum , not even the trend towards higher brightness temperatures at shorter wavelengths reported by @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that figure  4 of @xcite used data from fewer planets , and was normalized differently : the _ equilibrium temperature _ of each planet was divided out , rather than its actual _ dayside effective temperature_. recall that a planet s equilibrium temperature is what one would expect for a planet with zero bond albedo and uniform temperature ; it is merely a convenient theoretical quantity proportional to the irradiation temperature , @xmath18 , that we utilize in this work .",
    "the dayside effective temperature , on the other hand , is the weighted mean brightness temperature of the planet s dayside , as described in section  [ sec : teff ] .",
    "most hot jupiters have dayside effective temperatures greater than their equilibrium temperature ( dotted line in figure  [ fig : tdtoscatter ] ) due to imperfect day  night heat transport . as a result , the dayside of a hot jupiter emits somewhat more in the mid - ir  and considerably more in the near - ir ",
    "than one would predict based on its equilibrium temperature . in any case",
    ", we agree with @xcite that there are no signs of molecular absorption features in the aggregate spectrum . since molecules are undoubtedly present in the atmospheres of exoplanets , we conclude that their absorption features are being muted by vertically isothermal atmospheres , optically thick cloud , or both .     where applicable @xcite .",
    "uncertainty bars for both temperatures are shown , while dot size is proportional to the fraction of expected planetary emission that falls within observed wavebands .",
    "red symbols denote eccentric planets ( @xmath19 ) . the solid , dashed , and dotted lines correspond respectively to maximum dayside temperature , @xmath20 , uniform dayside with zero nightside temperature , @xmath21 , and equilibrium temperature , @xmath22 .",
    "the trend line is shown in green ; it suggests that hotter planets have disproportionately hot daysides . ]",
    "while brightness temperatures of brown dwarfs are strongly wavelength - dependent in the near - infrared @xcite , the external , asymmetric heating experienced by hot jupiters produces dayside atmospheres that are relatively isothermal in the vertical direction @xcite .",
    "this results in relatively featureless dayside emission spectra , which are amenable to model - independent estimates of bolometric flux and hence effective dayside temperature . if the nightsides of hot jupiters have greater vertical temperature structure , then nightside effective temperature estimates are less reliable .",
    "there is no universal way to derive the effective temperature of a planet from a collection of brightness temperatures .",
    "we therefore consider two methods with different physical motivations . in the first method , each brightness temperature is weighted by the inverse square of its respective uncertainty ( @xmath23 ) , so eclipse depths with small relative uncertainties contribute more to the inferred effective temperature .",
    "we call this the error - weighted mean ( ewm ) effective temperature .",
    "this method has the advantage of being robust to occasional outlier eclipse depths , but implicitly assumes that short - period planets have planck - like broadband spectra .",
    "the second method , which we only apply to dayside measurements , weighs the brightness temperatures by the expected integrated power in that waveband : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the planck function for the planet s estimated dayside effective temperature . to bypass an iterative solution , we adopt @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the irradiation temperature :",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 is the stellar radius and @xmath30 is the semi - major axis .",
    "this is an excellent match ( the dashed line in figure  [ fig : tdtoscatter ] ) to the actual dayside effective temperature of most planets in our sample .",
    "we call this the power - weighted mean ( pwm ) ; it is identical in spirit to the linear interpolation method of @xcite , but is easier to implement and runs faster .",
    "the pwm gives more weight to measurements near the peak of the planet s planck function and should , in the limit of high spectral coverage , produce accurate effective temperatures even if planets have broadband spectral features .    note that both ewm and pwm are biased in favor of broadband measurements : these observations tend to have smaller uncertainties , and they capture more of the planet s expected blackbody emission .",
    "the two methods produce generally consistent effective temperature estimates , which is a testament to the fact that most current dayside emission spectra are approximately planck - like .",
    "we use a @xmath31-step monte carlo analysis to estimate uncertainties in dayside effective temperatures . at each step in the monte carlo",
    ", we randomly vary the stellar effective temperature , transit depth , eclipse depth , and scaled semi - major axis , @xmath32 , according to their uncertainties .",
    "we use the published uncertainties for all of the above , except for single - epoch broadband eclipse depths where we inflate the published uncertainty by the factor @xmath33 ( such measurements have historically been less accurate than advertised ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also compute each planet s irradiation and brightness temperatures ( following equation  [ eq : bright ] ) .",
    "we then estimate each planet s dayside effective temperature ; to hedge our bets , we use the ewm for half of the mc steps , and the pwm for the other half . the resulting relationship between @xmath27 and @xmath34",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : tdtoscatter ] .",
    "the median property is plotted , and uncertainty bars denote standard deviation from the mc .",
    "based on dayside effective temperatures alone , one can not simultaneously specify bond albedo and heat recirculation efficiency .",
    "this degeneracy can be broken by supplementing thermal eclipses with one of two measurement types : phase variations at infrared wavelengths , or eclipse depths at visible wavelengths .",
    "table  [ tab : alt2edpvdata ] lists the published data for the fifteen planets which fall into one or both of these categories : observed wavelength and bandwidth , eclipse depths , and phase amplitudes .",

    "crucially , for every `` correction '' that we apply , we add appropriate uncertainty in our inference , either by randomly varying parameters in the monte carlo , or by adding systematic uncertainty in quadrature to the formal errors .",
    "our inferences of heat transport , bond albedo , and geometric albedo are therefore conservative .",
    "the upward trend in dayside effective temperature with irradiation temperature in figure  [ fig : tdtoscatter ] is unsurprising : one expects highly - irradiated planets to be hotter .",
    "the black lines in the plot can be thought of as limiting cases of either heat recirculation or bond albedo . in the zero - albedo limit",
    ", the black lines correspond to @xmath49 ( solid ) , @xmath79 ( dashed ) , and @xmath50 ( dotted ) .",
    "alternatively , in the zero - recirculation limit , the black lines correspond to @xmath80 ( solid ) , @xmath81 ( dashed ) , and @xmath82 ( dotted ) .",
    "therefore , planets that lie above the solid black line must have an internal energy source , while planets lying below the dotted black line must have non - zero bond albedo .",
    "we can also consider the qualitative claim from @xcite that @xmath34 increases _ disproportionately _ with @xmath27 .",
    "we ignore planets with significantly eccentric orbits , as this complicates their energy budget ( these planets are denoted in red in figure  [ fig : tdtoscatter ] . ) with double the planets and more data per planet , we find that @xmath83{-90 \\pm 80 } + \\num[scientific - notation = false]{0.87 \\pm 0.05 } t_{0}$ ] .",
    "the @xmath63 per datum of the fitted trend is @xmath84 , which is a reasonable fit .",
    "this is consistent with  but does not strengthen  the claim that planets receiving more stellar flux generally have lower bond albedo and/or less efficient heat transport .",

    "the irradiation temperatures of these planets span approximately @xmath85 , corresponding to @xmath86 for hd  189733b at the cool end ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 for wasp-18b ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the irradiation of wasp-12b is actually @xmath90 higher than wasp-18b , but their recirculation probability distribution functions overlap ( table  [ tab : fitval ] ) .    the notable exception to the @xmath27@xmath1 trend is wasp-43b , with @xmath91 but exhibiting virtually no heat transport ( @xmath49 with @xmath92 ) .",
    "our recirculation value is in agreement with the redistribution factor of @xcite , and our best - fit bond albedo ( @xmath93 ) is also consistent at the @xmath65 level .",
    "these parameters translate into a cold nightside temperature ( nominally @xmath94 ) , which we routinely find to be consistent with zero .",
    "coupled hydrodynamic and radiative transfer simulations of this planet were able to reproduce its dayside  but not nightside ",
    "emission @xcite , so the poor heat transport of this planet remains a mystery .",
    "the thermal measurements for wasp-18b suggest @xmath95 at @xmath65 .",
    "the planet s best - fit parameters would lie outside the plot to the left , which is indicative of either an internal heat source ( identical to a negative bond albedo in our parametrization ) or underestimated observational uncertainties .",
    "kepler-7b and wasp-43b also have @xmath69 well above zero , suggesting that either our model assumptions or the published uncertainties are incorrect .",
    "each of these planets would benefit from more thermal eclipse and phase measurements in order to reduce the systematic uncertainty in dayside and nightside effective temperatures .",
    "hd  189733b and hd  209458b benefit from full - orbit thermal observations as well as optical eclipse measurements , allowing us to compare infrared - based bond albedos to their optical geometric albedos .",
    "for hd  189733b we derive corrected geometric albedos of at @xmath96 m and at @xmath97 m , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "this red - optical geometric albedo is much lower than our bond albedo estimate of @xmath98 $ ] . for hd  209458b",
    "we obtain a corrected geometric albedo of at @xmath99 m , which agrees with @xcite .",
    "however , our @xmath65 interval for bond albedo is @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the tentative conclusion based on these two planets is that their bond albedos are considerably higher than their optical geometric albedos .",
    "most of the eclipse - only planets have low geometric albedos : @xmath101 ( figure  [ fig : bright_one_sigs_fsys ] ) .",
    "as anticipated , kepler-7b lies completely above this range @xcite , while the confidence region for kepler-13ab extends to a geometric albedo of 0.34 .",
    "the nine planets exhibit a wide variety of recirculation efficiencies , from corot-1b ( @xmath102 ) to kepler-7b ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "eclipse - only planets with similar irradiation temperatures are found at different locations on the @xmath1-axis , and we do not see evidence for a trend between irradiation temperature and recirculation efficiency as with the thermal observation planets .",
    "this is not surprising , since dayside measurements offer minimal leverage for inferring the nightside temperature .",
    "strictly speaking we only include these planets in figure  [ fig : bright_one_sigs_fsys ] by assuming that @xmath77 ; the actual comparison is more complex ( section  [ sec : geotobond ] ) .",
    "geometric albedo analyses encompassing several planets from our sample have been previously conducted .",
    "we compare our results in table  [ tab : whitegrayblack ] to overlapping planets from @xcite : hat - p-7b , kepler-5b , kepler-6b , kepler-7b , and tres-2b .",
    "our  uncorrected \" geometric albedos for all five planets show agreement within the stated confidence intervals . @xcite and @xcite also consider these planets , in addition to kepler-13ab , under both zero and perfect heat redistribution .",
    "our  full correction \" geometric albedos for five of the six planets are in agreement with values from both studies obtained in the maximum equilibrium temperature hypothesis ( i.e. hotter dayside temperatures implying greater thermal contamination of the optical eclipse ) .",
    "however , we find kepler-13ab to have dissimilar geometric albedo when using stellar parameters from @xcite with our greater thermal correction : versus and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "note this includes stellar effective temperature readjustment of kepler-13a to @xmath105 , down from @xmath106 @xcite .      in principle ,",
    "an optical eclipse depth is related to a planet s bond albedo @xcite . indeed , for a range of solar system planets and moons ,",
    "the bond albedo is roughly equal to the optical geometric albedo , albeit with a scatter of @xmath107 per cent .",
    "given the possibility of inhomogeneous albedo , uncertainty in the scattering phase function , and unknown reflectance spectrum , it would be imprudent to extrapolate this trend to hot jupiters .",
    "moreover , @xcite demonstrated that simply varying the incident stellar radiation can alter bond albedo by a factor of four for identical planets .",
    "our analysis of hot jupiters suggests that their optical geometric albedos are systematically lower than their bond albedos .",
    "there are three possible explanations for this discrepancy : ( 1 ) we have over - corrected the thermal contamination at optical wavelengths , ( 2 ) we have systematically underestimated the effective temperatures for planets with full - orbit phase variations , or ( 3 ) the geometric albedos of hot jupiters are , in fact , systematically lower than their bond albedos because of unexpected scattering phase functions and/or reflectance spectra .",
    "we address the first hypothesis by listing three different geometric albedo calculations in table  [ tab : whitegrayblack ] : these differ in their treatment of optical thermal emission . for six of the eleven planets",
    ", there is little difference between the geometric albedo estimate after a simple blackbody subtraction as opposed to the scenario with higher optical brightness temperature . for the remaining five planets , the  full correction \" geometric albedos are lower than their  simple correction \" counterparts . the planets for which the details of thermal emission correction are more important tend to either have higher irradiation temperatures and so greater likelihood for unattributed thermal contamination in the optical ( e.g. hat - p-7b ) , or have precise optical eclipse measurements where minor changes to the dayside emission have a larger impact on constraining reflected light ( e.g. tres-2b ) .",
    "our contamination analysis is also largely consistent with the geometric albedos inferred from higher equilibrium temperatures in both @xcite and @xcite . even in the unlikely event that hot jupiters have optical dayside brightness temperatures equal to that in the mid - infrared , the optical geometric albedos for most planets",
    "are significantly lower than the bond albedos inferred from thermal phase measurements .    the second solution to the geometric versus bond albedo discrepancy is that hot jupiters are much brighter in the nir , and hence thermal phase measurements  mostly obtained with _",
    "spitzer _ in the mid - ir  will underestimate their global temperatures and over - estimate their bond albedos .",
    "however , neither the dayside emission spectra of individual planets , nor their aggregate spectrum , show strong broadband molecular features .",
    "this means that dayside brightness temperatures from the near- through mid - ir should be reasonable proxies for their effective temperatures .",
    "one may worry that flux is escaping the nightsides of hot jupiters in the nir , leading us to underestimate nightside bolometric flux , but that is ruled out for wasp-43b by hst / wfc3 phase measurements , which show _ no _ nightside flux in the nir @xcite .",
    "it would be useful to have full - orbit nir phase curves of more planets in order to further test this hypothesis .",
    "this leaves us with the third hypothesis , namely that the bond albedos of most hot jupiters are high , despite their low geometric albedos .",
    "the geometric albedo of a planet ( light reflected back towards the illuminating star ) is related to its spherical albedo ( light reflected in all directions ) by a phase integral , @xmath108 .",
    "lambertian ( diffuse ) reflection results in @xmath109 , while pure rayleigh scattering produces @xmath110 . in general , planets with atmospheres ",
    "including simulated hot jupiters ",
    "have @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "it would be useful to empirically constrain the scattering phase functions of hot jupiters using data from space - based photometric missions .",
    "in the few cases where reflected phase variations have been measured , the spherical albedo appears so inhomogeneous that it is impossible to infer the phase - dependence of scattering @xcite .",
    "if we assume that hot jupiters are diffusely reflecting , then they have typical optical spherical albedos of 15 per cent , still well below the inferred bond albedos .",
    "the spherical albedo is related to the bond albedo via a flux - weighted integral @xcite : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the sed of the incident stellar flux . the degree to which the optical spherical albedo impacts the bond albedo depends on @xmath114 , the percentage of starlight emitted in the observed optical waveband , assuming blackbody radiation at @xmath14 ( values of @xmath114 are listed in table  [ tab : whitegrayblack ] ) .",
    "we consider limiting cases of equation  [ eq : waveint ] , assuming out - of - band wavelengths have average spherical albedos equal to @xmath115 , the optical @xmath116 , or @xmath117 respectively : @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 our limiting bond albedos are summarized in table [ tab : whitegrayblack ] . in principle",
    "the out - of - band spherical albedo could be unity , but as this would result in bond albedos so great that the planets would be cooler than is observed in the mid - ir , we adopt a more modest upper threshold in equation  [ eq : abhigh ] .    the @xmath121 scenario is a reasonable match to the bond albedos inferred from full - orbit thermal measurements .",
    "this suggests that most hot jupiters have geometric albedos of @xmath122 per cent in the nir and @xmath123 per cent in the optical . if hot jupiters are lambertian reflectors , the nir / optical contrast is somewhat less severe .",
    "this scenario similar in spirit to the high bond albedo combined with low red  nir geometric albedo one can obtain with rayleigh scattering @xcite , but with the opposite color .",
    "note that the high infrared albedos we are hypothesizing contradict the low infrared geometric albedo we assumed when estimating reflected ir light in section  [ sec : daynightsigs ] . using @xmath124 in our mc implies greater nir contamination from reflected starlight , and hence lower dayside thermal flux with greater bond albedo .",
    "the most extreme change is a 20 per cent increase in the bond albedo of wasp-12b , but nonetheless our conclusions remain unaffected .",
    "it is worth mentioning that geometric albedos of 60 per cent  from the optical through the nir  were predicted for the hottest giant exoplanets due to reflective silicate clouds @xcite . in order to explain the low optical geometric albedo",
    ", one could invoke an optical absorber at low pressures , above the purported cloud deck .",
    "such optical absorbers , originally theorized to explain hot jupiter temperature inversions , could include gaseous tio / vo @xcite or s@xmath125/hs @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", kepler-7b would be unique not because of its clouds , but due to its dearth of optical absorbers .    alternatively ,",
    "since cloud reflection is a multiple - scattering process , single - scattering albedos even marginally below unity can result in a heavily muted geometric albedo @xcite .",
    "one might therefore explain the unusually red reflectance spectrum of hot jupiters with a single cloud deck where individual cloud grains have nearly gray albedo .",
    "such scenarios might be tested by measuring the optical  infrared transit spectra of hot jupiters . if the purported absorbers are located at sufficiently low pressures , and if the upper atmospheres of these planets are not too hazy @xcite , then we would expect larger effective radii in the optical than the infrared . if instead the red reflectance spectrum is due to multiple scattering within a single cloud deck , then the transit spectrum should be flat .",
    "moreover , the best way to investigate these hypotheses would be to obtain thermal phase measurements for the planets that have precise optical geometric albedo constraints , and vice versa .",
