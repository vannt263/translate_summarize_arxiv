    "the interplay between topology and dynamics rates among the most outstanding challenges in complex network theory  @xcite . supported by a large amount of scientific evidence ,",
    "it has become clear that dynamical processes running on top of a complex network can be heavily influenced by the topological properties of the substrate @xcite , specially when the network shows a strongly heterogeneous pattern of connections , as in the case of the so - called scale - free ( sf ) networks , with a degree distribution ( probability that a vertex is connected to @xmath0 others ) scaling as a power - law @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "initial research on particle interaction models in networks focused on _ fermionic _ models , in which every node of the network can be occupied by at most one particle . within this framework ,",
    "a number of remarkable results were developed , concerning the effects of large degree fluctuations in the behavior of processes both in and out of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "recently , a new theoretical framework has been proposed to study general dynamical processes on complex networks , based in the concept of reaction - diffusion processes on metapopulations @xcite .",
    "reaction - diffusion ( rd ) processes @xcite are dynamical systems defined in terms of different kinds of particles or `` species , '' which diffuse stochastically and interact among them according to a given set of reaction rules . on the other hand",
    ", metapopulation is a concept coined in ecology that refers to the structural organization of populations as discrete entities that interact via migration or gene flow  @xcite .",
    "metapopulation ecology deals , among other subjects , with the local extinction and recolonization of spatially isolated patches , the evolutionary and genetic events involved in these process as well as the impact of human activity in the population dynamics  @xcite .    in the context of network theory , considering rd processes on metapopulations allows a _ bosonic _ view , in which a node can host more than one particle , particle interactions take place inside the nodes of the network ( thus representing the metapopulations ) , and particle transport ( mediated by diffusion ) takes place among nodes connected by edges .",
    "rd processes on metapopulations have been successfully applied to study different dynamics @xcite , but their most fruitful application is on epidemic spreading  @xcite , where metapopulations provide a realistic description of the multi - scale socio - geographical organization of people in countries , cities , neighborhoods , and so forth , where epidemics takes place , and in which the transportation patterns are , in general , highly complex  @xcite .",
    "an important common factor in most previous models of rd processes on metapopulations is that , while they take into account the heterogeneity of the connectivity pattern of the set of populations ( in terms of a complex network ) , they usually disregard the internal structure of the populations , taking a local homogeneous mixing approximation , equivalent to describing at mean - field level the reactions taking place inside each node .",
    "this approach raises the issue of the possible effects of the population inner structure in the behavior of the rd processes in this paper , we tackle this problem by considering a metapopulation rd version of a contact process ( cp ) @xcite on a network in which each vertex represents a structured population of fixed size given by a graph ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) . by means of extensive numerical simulations ,",
    "we show that the critical properties of the rd process are insensitive to the population structure , even in the extreme case of non - small world @xcite linear chains .",
    "this observation is confirmed by the perfect matching of numerical results with a heterogeneous mean - field solution @xcite , that completely neglects population structure the analysis of several variations of the model lead us to the extended conclusion that that critical properties of cp - like models on metapopulations depend exclusively on the topological structure of the metapopulation network .",
    "we have organized the paper as follows : the reaction - diffusion process considered is defined in section  [ sec : model ] , and the corresponding hmf theory is developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : hmf ] .",
    "the results of hmf theory are compared with quasi - stationary numerical simulations in section  [ sec : simu ] . finally , we draw our concluding remarks in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclu ] .",
    "we consider a rd process on metapopulations representing a contact process characterized by two typical scales : local populations where reaction processes of creation and annihilation take place , and non - local ( long - range ) interconnections between populations , see fig .",

    "the system is defined in terms of @xmath3 populations ( the metapopulation ) of fixed size @xmath4 connected by non - directed edges , defining a non - local network with a degree distribution that we choose to have a sf form , @xmath1 .",
    "exchange of particles , via diffusion , takes place along the edges of this network .",
    "the populations themselves are considered as homogeneous graphs with average degree @xmath5 .",
    "we have considered two forms for the local population network , a random regular network and a linear chain .",
    "the dynamics is defined as follows : vertices inside populations may be in two states , either occupied or empty .",
    "an occupied site creates offspring in all empty nearest neighbors ( nns ) inside its population at a rate @xmath2 ; occupied sites , on the other hand , annihilate spontaneously at rate @xmath6 ( this choice arbitrarily defines the dynamics time scale ) .",
    "finally , particles migrate between two connected populations at a rate @xmath7 .",
    "a migration event is performed by swapping a particle in a population and a vertex in a population connected by an edge . in our model only occupied sites migrate .",
    "the state devoid of particles represents an absorbing configuration from which the dynamics can not escape .",
    "we therefore expect that the system undergoes an absorbing - state phase transition @xcite , characterized by the order parameter @xmath8 , defined as the average density of particles .",
    "the transition will take place at some critical point @xmath9 , separating an active phase , with a constant average density of particles ( @xmath10 ) , and the absorbing state with @xmath11 .",
    "the analytical study of the absorbing - state phase transition in this model is a complex task , particularly in the case of local population in the shape of a linear chain .",
    "we will therefore make the strong simplification of assuming homogeneous mixing inside populations . in this case",
    ", the problem is amenable to analytical solution by applying the heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) approximation @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the evolution equation for the density @xmath12 of occupied sites in a population of degree @xmath0 takes the form @xmath13 where the conditional probability @xmath14 gives the probability that a node of degree @xmath0 is connected to a node of degree @xmath15 @xcite . the first term of eq .",
    "represents spontaneous annihilation , while the second one represents a creation event in empty sites with @xmath5 nns .",
    "notice that these two terms assume homogeneous mixing .",
    "the third and fourth terms represent the incoming and outgoing diffusive flow contributions due to migration of occupied sites .",
    "the factor @xmath16 in the third term reckons particles migrating to neighbor populations with equal chance . a stability analysis of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhok1 ] ) around the trivial empty state fixed point @xmath17 yields the linearized equation : @xmath18 where the jacobian matrix is @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the kronecker delta symbol .",
    "the active phase is obtained when the trivial fixed point becomes unstable , which happens if the largest eigenvalue of the jacobian is positive .",
    "obviously , the largest eigenvalue of @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath24 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath25 is an eigenvector of @xmath26 with eigenvalue @xmath27 .",
    "the matrix @xmath26 is irreducible because the network is connected and , consequently , perron - frobenius theorem  @xcite implies that @xmath26 has a unique eigenvector with positive components that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue .",

    "we can also show that close to the critical point the density approaches the asymptotic value as @xmath63 where the characteristic time diverges as @xmath64 with an exponent @xmath65 .",
    "interestingly , these critical exponents coincide with the hmf solution for the contact process in uncorrelated networks @xcite .",
    "this fact suggests an extension of the contact process approach to compute the finite - size scaling ( fss ) behavior of our model .",
    "indeed , applying the strategy proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the motion equation is mapped in a one - step process , we find ( see appendix  [ app : fss ] for details ) that the stationary density of occupied vertices , @xmath66 , and the characteristic time , @xmath67 , display an anomalous size dependence at the transition given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath71 depends only of @xmath3 through the network cut - off @xmath72 @xcite , we have that @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75",
    "in order to check the predictions of the hmf theory we performed extensive simulations of the rd process in heterogeneous metapopulations . the networks connecting populations were simulated using the uncorrelated configuration model ( ucm )  @xcite , that warrants the absence of degree correlation . letting @xmath76 represent the vertex @xmath77 inside the population @xmath78 ,",
    "the computer algorithm is implemented as follows : at each time step , an occupied vertex @xmath76 is chosen and the time increased by @xmath79 $ ] , where @xmath80 is the number of particles at time @xmath81 . with probability @xmath82 , the vertex becomes vacant .",
    "with probability @xmath83 , all empty nearest neighbors of @xmath77 inside population @xmath78 are occupied .",
    "finally , the migration to a randomly chosen vertex @xmath84 belonging to a neighbor population occurs with probability @xmath85 .",
    "we used a quasi - stationary ( qs ) simulation method where , every time the system visits the absorbing state , the absorbing configuration is replaced by a state randomly taken from the system history  @xcite . to implement the method ,",
    "a list containing @xmath86 configurations is stored and constantly updated .",
    "the updating is done by randomly picking up a stored configuration and replacing it by the current one with probability @xmath87 .",
    "we fixed @xmath88 ( the larger @xmath3 the smaller @xmath89 ) .",
    "after a relaxation time @xmath90 , the qs averages are computed over times up to @xmath91 .",
    "ensembles of 50 network configurations were used for statistical averages .",
    "the method used to determine critical points in simulations is based in the idea of the size independence at criticality of the moment ratio @xmath92 @xcite : by plotting the ratio @xmath93 as a function of @xmath2 for different values of the network size @xmath3 , the critical point will be given by the intersection of the plots for all network sizes .",
    "figure  [ fig : moments ] shows typical curves used to determine the critical point using the moment ratio technique .",
    "moment ratios for the reaction - diffusion processes on metapopulations connected by ucm networks with minimum degree @xmath94 and cutoff @xmath95 . in the main plot , the migration rate is @xmath96 , degree exponent is @xmath97 and the local population structure of the populations are rrns with size @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in the inset ,",

    "however , we can see that the mixing is indirectly caused by the random movements through populations mediated by diffusion .",
    "this effect is nevertheless not just due to the random choice of the position inside the neighbor population .",
    "we have modified the model ( variant 1 ) by using a deterministic migration rule in the choice of the new position inside a neighbor chain ( @xmath102 in the model implementation previously described ) .",
    "this rule mimics , in a very simple fashion , the fact that individuals use to visit places regularly .",
    "this modification does not change the hmf theory .",
    "numerically , simulations result in a small increase of the threshold ( from @xmath103 to @xmath104 for @xmath105 ) due to the reduction of the spreading power ; critical exponents , however , are not altered .",
    "simulations confirm the theoretical assertion , see fig .",
    "[ fig : variants ] .",
    "the model is also robust to other alterations of the dynamical rules .",
    "for example , we have considered a modification ( variant 2 ) consisting in replacing the exchange by the creation of a new particle in a neighbor population at rate @xmath7 . at the hmf level , the last term of equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhok1 ] ) vanishes , the jacobian matrix becomes @xmath106 and the critical @xmath107 is directly found , indicating that activity survives for any @xmath2 if @xmath108 .",
    "simulations confirm the hmf predictions : the critical point is reduced ( to @xmath109 for @xmath105 ) but critical exponents remain unchanged .",
    "figure [ fig : variants ] shows the finite size scaling for critical density @xmath66 and characteristic time @xmath67 for both variants .     and characteristic time @xmath67 in the variants of the rd process . in both variants ,",
    "the structured local populations are represented by chains with @xmath99 nearest neighbors .",
    "the migration rate is @xmath110 and the degree exponent is @xmath111",
    ". power laws @xmath112 and @xmath113 are shown for comparison.,width=302 ]",
    "in summary , we have investigated the effects of structured populations in reaction - diffusion ( rd ) processes representing a contact process ( cp ) on metapopulations modeled as complex networks .",
    "extensive numerical simulations on a variety of model modifications show that the critical behavior of the rd processes is essentially independent of the local population structure .",
    "the critical exponents observed are well accounted for by an heterogeneous mean - field theory ( hmf ) , and depend only on the topological properties of the metapopulation network ; hmf theory fails to reproduce non - universal properties such as the critical point , which can be however recovered approximately by using a homogeneous pair approximation .",
    "the agreement between simulations and hmf theory is the more surprising for local populations with the form of a linear chain , violating even the small - world property @xcite .",
    "the result presented here represent compelling evidence of the universality of the metapopulation rd framework to study the critial properties of cp - like models on networks , and moreover indicate that an _ a priori _ strong oversimplification such as neglecting the local structure is indeed valid , which implies that a simplified setting with local homogeneous mixing is enough to reproduce processes in realistic settings .",
