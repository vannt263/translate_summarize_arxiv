    "rotating black holes in 3 + 1 general relativity are described by the well - known kerr solution , which is singled out by the uniqueness theorem : kerr space - time is the only stationary , axisymmetric , asymptotically flat solution to the einstein equations in vacuum , which possesses an event horizon and free of closed time - like curves outside of it @xcite .",
    "thus , only mass @xmath0 and angular momentum @xmath1 , besides the electric charge @xmath2 which must be tiny for large astrophysical black holes , completely determine the properties of black holes in general relativity .",
    "therefore , kerr space - time has been extensively studied since its discovery in the context of various potentially observable phenomena , such as radiation of gravitational waves , accretion of matter , gravitational lensing , and also in the scope of theoretical questions related to evolution of black holes , gravitational collapse , hawking radiation and others @xcite .    at the same time ,",
    "einstein s general relativity , being apparently the simplest geometric theory of gravitation among others , raises a number of fundamental questions concerning the nature of singularities , dark energy and dark matter , quantization of gravitational interactions .",
    "attempts to resolve these questions lead theorists to a number of alternative theories of gravity ( e.g. the so - called modified theories of gravity , gravities with chern - simons , higher - curvature , and dilaton terms , brane - world scenarios , etc ) , which give the same observational consequences at the modern level of experiments , because einstein s gravity , as well as a number of its alternatives , has been tested only in the regime of the post - newtonian approximations , but non as a fully non - linear theory . a future experimental test of the strong field regime may be given by gravitational interferometers , which could detect gravitational waves from neutron stars and black holes through observation of the quasinormal modes of these compact objects .",
    "recently a number of works have been devoted to the study of potentially observable processes around various non - kerr black holes @xcite .",
    "therefore , a unified description of analogues of the schwarzschild and kerr solutions in various theories of gravity would be most useful for testing the alternatives .",
    "such a model was suggested by johannsen and psaltis @xcite who considered deviations from the schwarzschild and kerr solutions and found a regular outside the event horizon space - time , which reduces to the kerr one , when the deformation parameters vanish .",
    "the johannsen and psaltis metric is not a vacuum solution of the einstein equations , but is obtained in a kind of perturbative way in order to include various possible deviations from the kerr solution in alternative theories of gravity ( notice that an earlier attempt in constructing of the non - kerr solutions was made by glampedakis and babak @xcite ) .",
    "current observations restrain values of the deformation parameters @xmath3 , so that in the dominant order only one deformation parameter @xmath4 remains which leads either to more prolate ( @xmath5 ) or more oblate ( @xmath6 ) shape of the horizon than the one of kerr .",
    "thus , the johannsen - psaltis space - time is described by three parameters : mass @xmath0 , angular momentum per unit of mass @xmath7 and deformation @xmath8 .",
    "recently the johannsen - psaltis background has been studied in a number of papers @xcite with a special emphasis on gravitational lensing and penrose processes of energy extraction around such black holes . here , our aim is to study various processes of radiation ( both classical and quantum ) around such a generic black hole s model .",
    "a classical radiation of a field near a black hole consists of three stages , at each of which one of the following processes is dominating :    1 .",
    "initial outburst , which crucially depends on the initial perturbation , 2 .",
    "the intermediate damped oscillations represented by complex frequencies , termed quasinormal modes , and 3 .",
    "the asymptotic tails at late times .    therefore , here we study both processes which are independent on the initial conditions of the perturbation , the quasinormal modes and late - time tails , though , in the limit of vanishing rotation , due to inseparability of variables in field equations for the most general case .",
    "the hawking radiation , for estimation of which one requires the classical reflection index of fields , is also considered for the non - schwarzschild case .    another important characteristic which we consider is the binding energy of a particle moving from a given equatorial orbit to the innermost stable one .",
    "the binding energy allows one to learn how much energy the matter ( for example an accretion disk ) will release before plunging into the black hole .",
    "here we compute the binding energy for arbitrary rotation and deformation parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we have found that the binding energy is increasing if the shape of the horizon is more prolate than the one of kerr solution , that is , when @xmath9 . the hawking radiation , on the contrary ,",
    "is enhanced for larger values of @xmath8 .",
    "real oscillation frequencies of quasinormal ringing are increasing when the deformation parameter @xmath8 grows .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec ii we give some basic properties of the johannsen - psaltis black hole which will be explored in sec iii , devoted to deducing the wave equations and stability of scalar , electromagnetic , and dirac fields in the spherically symmetric background .",
    "iv describes numerical methods used in the paper . in order to find quasinormal modes we used frobenius expansion @xcite , wkb method @xcite , and time - domain integration @xcite , the last one was also used for getting late - time tails .",
    "sec v summarize the obtained results on quasinormal modes and late - time tails , while in sec vi the intensity of hawking radiation is computed for fields of various spin .",
    "note that throughout the paper we use geometrical units @xmath10 and fix the scale symmetry in all the numerical calculations such that the black hole mass @xmath11 .",
    "in boyer - lindquist coordinates the johannsen - psaltis metric @xcite can be written as    @xmath12 \\left(1-\\frac{2mr}{\\sigma}\\right)dt^2 + \\frac { 4amr\\sin^2\\theta } { \\sigma } [ 1+h(r,\\theta)]dtd\\phi -   \\frac { \\sigma[1+h(r,\\theta ) ] } { \\delta + a^2\\sin^2\\theta h(r,\\theta ) } dr^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\sigma d\\theta^2 - \\left [ \\sin^2\\theta \\left ( r^2 + a^2 + \\frac { 2a^2 mr\\sin^2\\theta } { \\sigma } \\right ) + h(r,\\theta ) \\frac{a^2(\\sigma + 2mr)\\sin^4\\theta } { \\sigma } \\right ] d\\phi^2 , \\label{metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 , @xmath0 is the black hole mass , @xmath7 is the rotation parameter , and the deformation parameter @xmath8 comes from the following general expansion    @xmath14    the requirement of the asymptotic flatness of the metric implies that @xmath15 .",
    "the current lunar laser ranging experiment constrains the post - newtonian parameters of the metric , so that @xmath16 can be neglected , and , in the dominant order , one can take @xcite : @xmath17 various astrophysical constraints on @xmath8 can be also found in @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we shall use the coefficients of the inverse metric in the equatorial plane ( @xmath18 ) :    @xmath19    the event horizon is located at the corresponding root of the equation @xmath20 , and the deformation parameter @xmath8 , once positive ( negative ) leads to a more prolate ( oblate ) object than the kerr black hole . as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , this space - time is free of closed timelike curves . for arbitrary",
    "@xmath24 the space - time has the closed event horizon and represents therefore a black hole . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath5 constrains the maximal value of the rotation parameter @xmath7 ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) , which becomes smaller than the one of kerr solution .",
    "the case @xmath25 corresponds to a very large deformation , which is not observed in nature .",
    "therefore , we shall not consider radiation phenomena for @xmath25 . yet , let us briefly comment on behavior of the johannsen - psaltis metric in this regime .",
    "the solution to equation @xmath26 corresponds to the space - time singularity , since the curvature and the kretschmann invariant approach infinity there as @xmath27 at the same time , equation @xmath26 at @xmath25 corresponds to an event horizon which is situated outside the kerr horizon .",
    "thus , the metric is not regular at the outer event horizon for @xmath28 , on the contrary to the claim of @xcite ( see , for example , fig . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath29 the above singular outer event horizon can be reached by an in - falling photons in finite time according to the remote observer s clock , as @xmath30 and the integral remains finite , when integrated from the outer event horizon : @xmath31",
    "in order to learn how much energy could be extracted from a particle slowly spiralling toward the black hole s horizon , it is necessary to learn what the energy of the particle at the innermost stable circular orbit is . for this purpose",
    "it is useful to introduce a function termed the _ binding energy _ , which is the amount of energy released by the particle going over from a given stable circular orbit located at @xmath32 to the innermost stable orbit @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the binding energy in percent is @xmath34 frequently , instead of some given circular orbit @xmath32 a particle coming from infinity is considered , so that @xmath35 is taken in the above definition of the binding energy .",
    "the binding energy for the schwarzschild black hole is about @xmath36 percent and for the extremal kerr black hole can be as large as @xmath37 percent .",
    "this is much larger than , for instance , the binding energy at the nuclear fusion , which is about @xmath38 percent of the rest mass energy .",
    "recently the binding energy for charged particles around a black hole deformed by the tidal force and magnetic field has been found in @xcite .    for our case of a stationary , axisymmetric metric , one has three integrals of the motion , @xmath39 which are particle s rest mass @xmath40 , energy @xmath41 , and angular momentum @xmath42 .",
    "then , the equation @xmath43 leads in the equatorial plane to the following relation : @xmath44 the energy @xmath45 and momentum @xmath1 of a particle at a circular orbit @xmath46 can be determined numerically from the requirements : @xmath47 then , the numerically obtained @xmath48 , @xmath49 allow one to use formula ( [ be ] ) .    .binding energy @xmath50 for various values of the deformation parameter @xmath8 and rotation @xmath7 .",
    "left columns are for particles co - rotating with a black hole , right columns are for counter rotating particles .",
    "the star means that the extremal values @xmath51 for co - rotating particles was reached in computation only asymptotically , as the innermost stable orbit approaches the horizon in this case . [ cols=\">,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results of computations for the energy - emission rates are shown on fig .",
    "[ hr ] . the larger the absolute value of @xmath8 is , the more suppressed emission rates are . on table",
    "[ eer ] one can see that the deviation from schwarzschild values are larger for fields of higher spin .",
    "this can be easily understood from the expression for the effective potentials of scalar , maxwell , and dirac fields ( [ effpot ] ) .",
    "since @xmath52 always appears with the factor @xmath53 , which contains @xmath8 , the larger multipole number @xmath54 is , the bigger deviation arises in the potential due to @xmath8 . at the same time",
    "the effective potential for the scalar field does not depend at all on @xmath8 when @xmath55 , which corresponds to the dominant contribution in the emission rates .",
    "investigation of potentially observable phenomena around black holes in a large number of alternative theories of gravity would be a difficult , if not never ending , task , since even solutions for black hole metric are not known in many of such theories .",
    "a kind of phenomenologically unified description of black holes by the johannsen - psaltis space - time gives us the generic model which can be studied with simple numerical tools .",
    "here we have analyzed a number of radiation processes in the vicinity of the johannsen - psaltis space - time through consideration of their essential characteristics :    1 .",
    "the binding energy of a particle spiralling into the black on an equatorial orbit , 2 .",
    "proper ( quasinormal ) modes , late - time tails and stability of scalar , dirac , and maxwell fields , 3 .",
    "intensity of the hawking radiation of these fields .",
    "we have shown that the binding energy is increasing for more prolate than kerr configurations , what corresponds to positive deformation parameter @xmath8 . in a similar manner ,",
    "real oscillation frequencies of quasinormal modes are larger for positive @xmath8 , though , at asymptotically late time the power - law tails coincide with the schwarzschild ones",
    ". we were able to find analytic expressions for the frequency in two regimes : 1 ) for the fundamental modes and small and moderate @xmath8 and 2 ) in the eikonal regime @xmath56 .",
    "we have found that the real oscillation frequencies are approximately linear in @xmath8 , for small and moderate values of @xmath8 .",
    "stability of the fields under consideration has been proved .",
    "the intensity of the hawking radiation is shown to be suppressed for positive @xmath8 and enhanced for negative ones .",
    "our work could be complemented by the analysis of classical and quantum radiation processes for massive fields .",
    "a drawback of our approach is in the apparent impossibility to decouple variables in the boyer - lindquist coordinates in the field equations for a non - zero rotation parameter , so that quasinormal modes and the hawking radiation were analyzed only for non - rotating black holes .",
    "perhaps , a kind of prolate coordinate system , which takes into account the symmetry of the space - time , could remedy the situation .",
    "thus , a further study of properties of the killing - yano tensor for the johannsen - psaltis space - time is appealing . at the same time , strong dependence of the qnms and intensity of hawking radiation on the deformation parameter @xmath8 leaves us hope that the obtained here results will remain qualitatively the same at least for slow rotations .",
