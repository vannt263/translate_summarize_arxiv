    "non equilibrium statistical mechanics is a vast subject , rapidly evolving under the push of major recent breakthroughs , like the discoveries of fluctuations theorems , the out - of - equilibrium generalizations of the fluctuation - dissipation relations or the development of variational principles  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the fluctuations of macrovariables in non - equilibrium conditions , analyzing the remarkable features arising from the conjunction of the following elements :    _ 1 - duality of typical and rare events_. the distinction between typical and rare events is relative to a given statistical ensemble ( the prior ) , reflecting the conditions of observation .",
    "of particular current interest , in many different contexts ranging from classical  @xcite to quantum  @xcite , is the task of constructing a dual ensemble in which an event , rare in the prior , becomes typical in the dual one .",
    "this kind of problem is addressed and solved in the framework of large deviation theory  @xcite .    _ 2 - condensation of fluctuations_. condensation transitions as average or typical properties",
    "are ubiquitous and familiar phenomena , much studied , both in equilibrium and out of equilibrium , since a long time .",
    "suffice it to quote the two celebrated examples of the condensation of supersaturated vapor in real space and of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in momentum space  @xcite .",
    "much less familiar , and of more recent interest , is the concept of condensation of fluctuations , that is of condensation as a rare event  @xcite .",
    "these two instances of condensation , on average and of fluctuations , are the two facets of a unique phenomenon , related via the above mentioned ensemble duality and corresponding to different observation protocols .    _ 3 - condensation triggered by equipartition breaking_. we shall restrict to condensation transitions occurring through a mechanism _  la _ bec . whether such a mechanism can be implemented or not depends on the observable of interest and on the chosen statistical ensemble",
    ". we shall be chiefly interested in the energy as a macrovariable and we shall see that , for the mechanism _  la _ bec to operate , the equipartition of energy must be violated . hence , condensation of energy fluctuations arises _ exclusively _ as an out of equilibrium phenomenon _ and _ in the transient regime .",
    "condensation of fluctuations arising both in and out of equilibrium have been recently analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    from the combined occurrence of these three elements there arises a rich and interesting phenomenology , which will be studied as the system relaxes from one equilibrium state to another .",
    "specifically , we shall consider an instantaneous temperature quench : the system is initially prepared in equilibrium at the temperature @xmath7 and , then , at the time @xmath8 is put in contact with a new thermal reservoir at the lower temperature @xmath9 , producing the relaxation toward the new equilibrium state .",
    "we shall consider an extended system with a phase diagram containing a critical point at the temperature @xmath1 .",
    "just to fix the ideas , we may think of @xmath1 as the curie temperature of a ferromagnet , which is paramagnetic above @xmath1 and ferromagnetic below @xmath1 , but the considerations we shall make hold in general .",
    "the reason for studying such a process is that if the quench is made from @xmath7 to @xmath9 , both above @xmath1 , then there is a finite equilibration time allowing to overview the full evolution of fluctuations from initial equilibrium , to intermediate off - equilibrium behavior and again to equilibrium in the final state .",
    "instead , if @xmath7 is taken above and @xmath9 below @xmath1 , the system undergoes phase - ordering  @xcite , where the equilibration time scales like the size of the system .",
    "thus , a system of thermodynamic size remains , for all practical purposes , permanently out of equilibrium and , as we shall see , there arise important qualitative differences in the behavior of fluctuations  @xcite .    as observables , in addition to the total energy chosen as a one - time macrovariable",
    ", we shall also consider the heat exchanged with the cold reservoir in a time interval @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , as a two - times macrovariable .",
    "the model system will be treated analytically , via a mean - field theory which allows to effectively decouple the degrees of freedom .",
    "this is an important feature , since , after introducing the notion of effective temperature per degree of freedom , the transition from equilibrium to off - equilibrium can be characterized as an equipartition breaking process .",
    "this goes as follows . in the initial equilibrium state",
    "all degrees of freedom are at the same temperature @xmath7 and equipartition holds .",
    "as soon as relaxation begins , immediately after the quench , the spectrum of effective temperatures is no more flat and equipartition is broken  @xcite .",
    "the amount of equipartition breaking , encoded in the deviation from flatness of the temperature spectrum , quantifies the amount of departure from equilibrium . eventually , if the system equilibrates equipartition is restored , while if the system does not equilibrate , as in the quench to below @xmath1 , equipartition remains permanently broken according to a pattern characteristic of the asymptotic regime .    a remarkable consequence of equipartition breaking , as mentioned above , is the appearance of the condensation of fluctuations , when the temperature spectrum develops a minimum or a maximum at zero wave vector .",
    "then , the entire amount of the fluctuation exceeding a certain critical threshold is contributed by the zero - wave - vector degree of freedom , via a mechanism whose mathematics is the same of bec .",
    "the nature of this condensation phenomenon will be analyzed in detail .",
    "here we stress , first of all , that the analogy with bec is only formal , since bec is about an average equilibrium property , while condensation of fluctuations is about rare events off - equilibrium .",
    "secondly , condensation phenomena have been recently studied in a variety of different contexts , ranging from the realm of statistical physics ( in and out of equilibrium , classical  @xcite and quantum  @xcite ) to problems of interest in economics and information theory  @xcite . however , most of these works deal with identically distributed variables and with stationary states .",
    "the specificity of what we do in the present work is that variables are not identically distributed and in the non stationary nature of the relaxation process .",
    "both of these features are essential for the appearance of the breaking of equipartition , which is at the basis of the condensation phenomenon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ eh ] we introduce the general concepts needed in the study of the fluctuations of macrovariables , with particular attention to the ensemble theory structure underlying the dichotomy typical vs rare events .",
    "the ideal bose gas is briefly worked out as an example and as a reminder of bec . in sec .",
    "[ largen ] , after presenting the large @xmath0 model and its exact solution , we set up the formal apparatus for the study of fluctuations of energy and heat .",

    "are made in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the general concepts of fluctuations of a macrovariable , of typical and rare events , and of ensemble duality .    consider a generic prior probability distribution @xmath12 of elementary events @xmath13 in a phase space @xmath14 and with control parameters @xmath15 .",
    "the probability of a fluctuation @xmath16 of a random variable @xmath17 is given by p(m , j ) = _ d p(,j)(m - m ( ) ) .",
    "[ gen.3 ] most of the times this is just a formal expression , since the restriction of the integration domain , due to the @xmath18 function , makes the calculation impracticable .",

    "( [ gen.5 ] ) can be rewritten as p(m , j , v ) = _ - i^+ i e^-v[zm + _ m(z , j ) ] , [ gen.6 ] where the @xmath21 dependence is made explicit , @xmath22 is the density @xmath23 and -_m(z , j ) = k_m(z , j , v ) [ gen.7bis ] is the volume independent scaled cumulant generating function .",
    "carrying out the integration by the saddle point method , the large deviation principle is obtained p(m , j , v ) ~e^-vi_m(m , j ) , [ gen.8 ] with rate function i_m(m , j ) = z^*m + _",
    "m(z^*,j ) , [ gen.9 ] where @xmath24 is the solution , supposedly unique , of the saddle point equation _ m(z , j ) = -m .",
    "[ gen.9bis ] from the above algebra follows the basic result of large deviation theory  @xcite that @xmath25 and @xmath26 form a pair of legendre transforms .    _ typical and rare events _    the large deviation principle implies that the probability of @xmath22 is concentrated about the most probable value @xmath27 , identified by the condition @xmath28 .",
    "this allows to discriminate between typical and rare events .",
    "typical are events in the immediate neighborhood @xmath27 .",
    "all other outcomes of @xmath22 , lying on the tails of the rate function , are rare events , since they do occur with an exponentially low probability . clearly , the qualification of an outcome as typical or rare , is relative to the given prior distribution , that is , to the given preparation protocol , specified by the set of control parameters @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , for a thermodynamic system @xmath15 contains the list of the conserved extensive quantities and of the applied intensive fields , like temperature , pressure and so on .",
    "then , one of the key features of the rate function is that it may serve a twofold purpose : either as the just specified quantifier of the rarity of a large deviation in the prior , or as the prescription of how to change the observation protocol , in order to render typical an event which is rare in the prior . in order to understand the latter statement ,",
    "let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ gen.9bis ] ) as m= _ z^ * , [ gellis.01 ] where @xmath29 stands for the average with respect to the distribution ( , z , j , v ) = p(,j , v ) e^zm ( ) .",
    "[ du.2 ] then , the meaning of eq .",
    "( [ gellis.01 ] ) is that the event @xmath22 becomes typical in the statistical ensemble obtained by imposing the exponential bias @xmath30 on the prior , which means that the preparation protocol must be changed by putting the system in contact with a reservoir of the observable @xmath19 and by fixing the intensive parameter @xmath31 , conjugated to @xmath19 , to the value @xmath24 such that condition  ( [ gellis.01 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "consequently , @xmath26 plays the role of the `` thermodynamic potential '' in the biased statistical ensemble and , the rate function @xmath25 , as the legendre transform of @xmath26 , plays the role of the thermodynamic potential of the system prepared with yet another protocol , that is by constraining rigidly @xmath32 to take the value @xmath22 , which is nothing but the obvious way to render typical the event @xmath22 .",
    "the statistical ensemble of the latter protocol , to be referred to as the constrained ensemble , is obtained by projecting the prior on the subset of events satisfying the imposed constraint ( , m , j , v ) = p(,j , v)(m - m ( ) ) .",
    "[ gen.2 ]    summarizing , the twofold role of the rate function brings into the picture _ three _ statistical ensembles : the prior on one side , denoted by @xmath33 , and the biased and the constrained ensembles on the other , denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the remarkable aspect of these formal relations is in the predictive power of @xmath25 , in the sense that by observing fluctuations in the prior we can predict what will happen in the biased or in the constrained ensemble and vice versa , much in the same way as it works with the fluctuation dissipation relations  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath25 is obtained from the biased or constrained ensemble , it plays the role of a _",
    "fluctuation theory_. conversely , the observation of fluctuations is crucial when constraints or biasing fields can not be implemented in practice , as we shall see in the following .",
    "lastly , the duality of @xmath25 becomes of particular interest when singularities appear  @xcite .",
    "then , looking at @xmath25 as a thermodynamic potential , singular behavior is readily interpreted as symptomatic of a phase transition  @xcite , whose counterpart in the context of the prior ensemble is the novel and unfamiliar phenomenon of a phase transition in the behavior of fluctuations .",
    "this is all the more interesting because condensation of the fluctuations may occur , as we shall see , even in non interacting systems , which can not sustain condensation as an average thermodynamic property .",
    "as anticipated in the introduction , the study of fluctuations condensation is a central theme in this paper .",
    "however , before addressing the problem off - equilibrium , in the following subsection the concept of duality will be illustrated in the usual framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "let us consider an ideal gas of bosons in a box of volume @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the space dimensionality of the system .",
    "the microstates are the sets of occupation numbers @xmath38 of the single particle momentum eigenstates @xmath39 , where , imposing periodic boundary conditions , the allowed wave vectors values are k = m , m_i=0,1 , 2 , ...",
    "[ ibg.1bis ] in the following we shall take @xmath40 and , therefore , @xmath41 .",
    "the extensive macrovariables of interest are the energy , which is separable ( ) = _ k h_k(n_k ) , [ ibg.2 ] with @xmath42 and the number function ( ) = _ k n_k .",
    "[ ibg.3 ] we assume that the single particle dispersion relation is of power law form @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a proportionality constant . for instance , for photons @xmath45 , velocity of light , and @xmath46 , while for particles with mass @xmath22 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    when the system is in equilibrium with a thermal bath at the temperature @xmath49 ( taking @xmath50 , as in the rest of the paper ) and with a particle reservoir at the chemical potential @xmath51 , the prior is the grand canonical ensemble p(,,,v ) = e^- , [ ibg.50 ] where z_gc(,,v ) = _ ( v ) d e^- [ ibg.51 ] is the grand partition function and @xmath52 is the phase space , with no restriction on the total particle number .",
    "we shall now look at the the fluctuations of energy and number in two particular cases .      in the limit of infinite temperature ( @xmath53 ) ,",
    "the prior ensemble becomes uniform p(,v ) = , [ ibg.52 ] where @xmath54 is the phase space volume .",

    "recall that , having taken the limit of @xmath0 large , we are looking at a single component under the action of the mean - field interaction due to all the other components , which gives rise to the time dependence of @xmath251 . as a consequence , for @xmath255 a negative branch appears in the temperature spectrum , as illustrated in the left panel of fig .  [ efftempninfty ] .",
    "the evolution is as follows .",
    "initially , at @xmath8 , the spectrum is flat ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "then , as soon as the system is quenched , equipartition is broken , with a pattern showing the formation of a peak which narrows and moves toward the origin . at early times , for @xmath258 , all the modes cool with the modes on the sides of the peak cooling faster than the peak",
    ". however , for @xmath255 the peak reverses the trend by growing and warming up , while the modes on its sides keep on cooling . denoting by @xmath259 the wave vector magnitude of the _ hot _ peak , on the short wave length side @xmath260 equilibration to @xmath189 takes place . instead",
    ", the long wave length modes @xmath261 keep on cooling indefinitely , entering the negative branch for @xmath255 .",
    "this is a remarkable feature , due to the nonlinearity of the model , showing that energy is not just lost to the environment as in the gaussian case , but that in the process there is also reshuffling among the modes , while the global average energy relaxes to zero , as it will be clear shortly .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that in the late stage of phase - ordering dynamical scaling holds , in the sense that all lengths in the problem can be rescaled with respect to the characteristic time dependent length @xmath262 , representing the typical size of the growing domains of the ordered phases  @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath0 model is one of the few cases in which scaling can be derived analytically  @xcite , yielding for the equal time structure factor c_k(t ) = t^d/2f(kt^1/2 ) , [ sc.1 ] with @xmath263 .",
    "now , rewriting eq .",
    "( [ gin.10 ] ) as _",
    "k(t ) = -2 ^ -1_k(t ) , [ sc.2 ] from eq .",
    "( [ sc.1 ] ) follows immediately the scaling form of the effective temperature ^-1_k(t ) = t^d/2 - 1g(kt^1/2 ) , [ sc.3 ] with g(x ) = ( 8 ) ^d/2(x^2-d/4)e^-2x^2 .",
    "[ sc.4 ] thus , plotting @xmath264 against @xmath265 , the curves for different values of @xmath206 should collapse on the master curve  ( [ sc.4 ] ) .",
    "this is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ efftempninfty ] , where the last curve , for @xmath266 , is undistinguishable from the plot of the scaling function @xmath267 .",
    "once scaling sets in , the scaling function captures in one shot , so to speak , the entire asymptotic time evolution .",
    "the shape of @xmath267 tells us that the formation of the hot peak and , therefore , the breaking of equipartition are permanent features of the phase - ordering process .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the behavior of the average energy , which , instead , equilibrates .",
    "in fact , using eq .",
    "( [ indv.2bis ] ) , we have _",
    "eff[,t ] = _ 0^ dk k^d-1 ^-1_k(t ) [ ggg.1 ] and inserting the scaling form  ( [ sc.3 ] ) for the effective temperature there follows that @xmath268 \\rangle$ ] , for large @xmath206 , vanishes like @xmath254 .",
    "thus , while the total average energy shows a seemingly smooth relaxation to equilibrium , the spectrum of effective temperatures reveals that the system is in fact stuck out of equilibrium , as well illustrated by the pattern of breaking of equipartition .",
    "the difference between the two regimes , before and after @xmath253 , is even more evident in the spectrum of inverse effective temperatures ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ invefftempninfty ] ) .",
    "let us , then , look at the implications for the behavior of energy fluctuations .    _ @xmath258 _    in this time regime",
    "the spectrum contains only the positive branch ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ invefftempninfty ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath205 is defined for @xmath269 .",
    "proceeding as in sec .",
    "[ largevolume ] , in place of eq .",
    "( [ condav.1 ] ) we now have e = _ k_h _ z + f_h(z , t ) , [ frrmg.3 ] where @xmath205 diverges as @xmath31 approaches the lower edge of the spectrum at @xmath270 , since @xmath271 . thus , as long as @xmath258 , the first term in the right hand side of the above equation is negligible and there is no condensation .    _",
    "@xmath255 _    in this regime , as already mentioned and as shown in fig .",
    "[ invefftempninfty ] , the spectrum exhibits both a negative and a positive branch , with edges at @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "thus , the domain of definition of @xmath205 narrows to the finite interval @xmath274 . as @xmath275",
    ", the lower bound of @xmath205 converges , yielding the critical threshold e_c(t ) = f_h(_0,t ) .",
    "[ frrmg.5 ] the phase diagram , obtained by plotting @xmath207 for @xmath255 , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ enphasediagninfty ] . comparing with the phase diagram of the gaussian model , in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ ph_diag_s ] , apart for the different shapes of the curves , the prominent qualitative difference is that the positions of the normal and condensed phases are reversed with respect to the critical line .",
    "namely , in the gaussian case condensation takes place if an energy fluctuation is forced above a certain level , while the opposite occurs in the large @xmath0 model .",
    "the origin of this radically different behavior is in the shapes of effective temperatures spectra , with @xmath201 minimizing the positive branch in the first case and maximizing the negative branch in the second one .",
    "now , since the presence of the negative branch is a consequence of the failure to equilibrate , the reversal of the phase diagram is the most conspicuous manifestation that in the quench to below @xmath1 the system does not equilibrate .",
    "we have investigated the fluctuations of energy and heat during the relaxation following an instantaneous temperature quench .",
    "the study has been carried out analytically in the gaussian model , for a quench in the paramagnetic phase , and in the large @xmath0 model , for a quench below @xmath1 .",
    "the main finding is the condensation of fluctuations in the transient out - of - equilibrium regime , which occurs when the pattern of equipartition breaking produces a spectrum with an extremal point at zero wave vector .",
    "then , condensation is driven by the same mathematical mechanism responsible of bec .",
    "the dynamical nature of the transition is well illustrated by the phase diagrams extending in the time direction .",
    "we have treated the quenches in the paramagnetic and in the ferromagnetic phase , in order to study the cases of a finite relaxation time and of an aging system , which remains permanently out of equilibrium but not in a stationary state . in both cases ,",
    "the concept of effective temperature plays an essential role in the characterization of the distance from equilibrium and in uncovering the mechanism of the transition .    at first sight , it may seem surprising that a transition occurs in a non interacting system , such as the gaussian model .",
    "the apparent puzzle is solved in the framework of ensemble duality , showing that condensation of fluctuations in the prior , as a large deviation manifestation , corresponds to condensation on average in the biased ensemble , where the imposition of the bias amounts to a mean - field interaction .",
    "finally , let us remark that the interplay of the different ensembles related by the rate function , is very interesting in itself , since ensembles are the byproduct of the observation procedures .",
    "in this respect , much effort has been devoted to use ensemble duality to find implementable ways of making accessible to observation rare events . however , at least in principle , the connection could work also in the opposite way , in those cases where the imposition of the bias could be more difficult to realize than the observation of large deviations .    finally , the natural question is about the generality of the results reported in this paper .",
    "they ought to be generic for separable systems , which is a prerequisite for a meaningful definition of an effective temperature per normal mode .",
    "though blurred , the picture ought to survive also in weakly interacting systems , much in the same way as for bec of cold atoms .",
    "more speculative is the question of the possible observation , since it involves recording of the fluctuations , whose feasibility clearly depends on how far is the critical threshold from the average observed behavior and , therefore , can be addressed only on a case - by - case basis .          for recent reviews",
