    "quantum phase transitions originating from quantum fluctuations have been extensively studied as a hot issue in condensed - matter physics .",
    "several interesting characteristics of the transitions appear in the low - energy behavior of the systems .",
    "two types of approach can capture the phase transitions and critical phenomena precisely when the transition is continuous .",
    "one is analyzing the energy - level structure .",
    "the other involves considering the ground - state behavior .    in the former approach ,",
    "a standard method is to analyze the structure of the energy levels of finite - size systems based on the finite - size scaling ( fss ) assumption .",
    "for example , the scaled energy gap @xcite is often used to estimate the boundary of the gapped phase as the transition point .",
    "this is called phenomenological renormalization group ( prg ) analysis .",
    "however , it is difficult to estimate the transition point when a logarithmic correction appears in the dependence of the energy difference .",
    "a typical example is the berezinskii ",
    "kosterlitz  thouless ( bkt ) transition @xcite . to resolve this difficulty",
    ", the level - spectroscopy method has been developed @xcite and precise determinations of phase transitions have been successfully made for various transitions in many models .",
    "unfortunately , this analysis is complicated in that appropriate adjustments of the procedure are required according to the type of phase transition , which must also be known in advance .    in the latter approach ,",
    "on the other hand , quantities that characterize the ground state are carefully observed .",
    "one of these quantities is the multi - point correlation function .",
    "the long - range behavior of correlation functions shows whether the system exhibits long - range order .",
    "if a correlation function survives to be nonzero in the long - range limit , it is an appropriate order parameter .",
    "however , it is not easy to capture a phase transition using this strategy because reliable and precise data on correlation functions are necessary for large systems .",
    "the system sizes that are treated in numerical - diagonalization calculations are insufficient .",
    "for this reason , the latter approach has been employed in only a few studies .",
    "therefore , no systematic procedure for analyzing ground - state quantities to capture quantum phase transitions has been established to date .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a procedure to determine the transition point and critical exponents by analyzing correlation functions based only on the scaling assumption .",
    "a feature of this approach is that only the common quantities under the same condition are treated irrespective of the type of phase transition .",
    "we call the procedure ground - state phenomenological renormalization group ( gsprg ) analysis . to confirm its validity and usefulness in detecting phase transitions , we apply it to a nontrivial ground state in the af @xmath0 @xmath1 chain with uniaxial single - ion anisotropy by the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite",
    ".    in the isotropic case of this system , there exists a nonzero energy gap between the unique ground state and the first excited state , called the haldane gap@xcite .",
    "it is known that when anisotropy is introduced , of the single - ion type or of the @xmath1-type exchange interaction , the haldane gap decreases and finally closes .",
    "the region where the nonzero haldane gap exists is called the haldane phase .",
    "the phase diagram of the af @xmath0 chain with anisotropy of the two types , including the haldane phase , has been extensively studied by analyzing the energy - level structure , assisted by the level - spectroscopy method @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in many af spin systems , the standard spin ",
    "spin correlation function gives so - called n@xmath2el order .",
    "in the ground state in the haldane phase , however , the spin ",
    "spin correlation function decays exponentially with a finite correlation length and the n@xmath2el order no longer exists . in this sense ,",
    "the haldane phase is a disordered phase .",
    "however , the string order parameter is known to characterize the ground state in the haldane phase , in which the longitudinal and transverse string order parameters are nonzero @xcite . from the viewpoint of the string order",
    ", it is possible to treat the haldane phase as an ordered phase and capture the phase transition at the boundary .",
    "this approach has been applied to numerical - diagonalization data of the haldane phase in @xmath0 systems@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , only very small system sizes were available and hence it was quite difficult to capture precisely the critical behavior of the string order near the transition point .",
    "in this situation , we can obtain numerical data of the string order of this model for much larger system sizes by using dmrg for gsprg analysis .",
    "consequently , it is possible to examine the phase transition at the boundary of the haldane phase from the viewpoint of the string order .",
    "we compare our results with those from the analysis of the energy - level structure .",
    "this comparison provides a systematic and consistent understanding of the phase transition .",

    "the n@xmath2el order parameter vanishes .",

    "we carry out a finite - size extrapolation derived from the fss formula . as the second step ,",
    "we introduce a finite - size quantity which we calculate from the string order parameters .",
