    "a quantum system composed of two or more entangled subsystems has the intriguing property that although the state of the total system can be well defined , it is impossible to identify individual properties for each one of its parts . understanding the properties displayed by the entanglement of physical systems is one of the fundamental purposes of quantum information theory @xcite . in this paper",

    "+ the question that naturally arises is : what are the quantum signatures of classical parametric resonance ? there is no classical behavior analogous to entanglement , it is unique to quantum mechanics . in this paper we show that this intrinsically quantum property shows strong signatures of classical parametric resonance in a system of two driven coupled harmonic oscillators .",

    "in contrast , for values of the static coupling that belong to the unstable zones , the probability density has also an oscillatory behaviour but with a different ingredient : when the system evolves , the density is systematically stretched in a fixed direction , with a consequent dilation in the perpendicular direction , this behavior results in a massive delocalisation of the wave function of the total system .",
    "this behaviour is very suggestive , because the wigner function for one oscillator in our case exhibits a similar pattern , but with a corresponding change in the stretching direction in phase space as time evolves , the wigner function of one oscillator ensemble results in a delocalisation in phase space , a fact that we associate with the  maximal mixing \" scenario .",

    "in contrast to this result , when the environment is a stable oscillator , the von neumann entropy oscillates , but does not increase over time .",
    "we can think of our system from another perspective : assuming that the universe is composed of two coupled oscillators , we consider that one oscillator is the system of interest , and the other oscillator is the environment .",
    "in contrast to the model @xcite , in our case , both systems are stable , however , control over the dynamics is established through the time - dependent coupling between the oscillators .",
    "numerical results suggest that the von neumann entropy for the system s reduced density operator exhibits the same behavior described above . comparing our results with those found by blume - kohout and zurek , we find that the effect of external control over the system is to produce instability in the universe , which is related to the phenomenon of parametric resonance . this instability is reflected in a loss of coherence in the system of interest .",

    "<S> we study the relationship between entanglement and parametric resonance in a system of two coupled time - dependent oscillators . as a measure of bipartite entanglement </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the linear entropy for the reduced density operator , from which we study the entanglement dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the bipartite entanglement increases in time up to a maximal mixing scenario , when the set of auxiliary dynamical parameters are under parametric resonance . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we obtain a closed relationship between the correlations in the ground state , the localisation of the wigner function in phase space , and the localisation of the wave function of the total system . </S>"
