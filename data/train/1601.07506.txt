    "the elementary excitations of one - dimensional topological superconductors are majorana bound states ( mbs ) , equal to their own anti - particles .",
    "this was first discovered by kitaev @xcite , and has spurred enormous interest @xcite from the condensed matter community in the fundamental properties of this novel phase of matter , as well as its potential applications in topological quantum computation ( tqc ) @xcite .",
    "one recipe for mbs involves a semiconducting nanowire with a strong spin - orbit coupling , with induced superconductivity due to proximity with an s - wave superconductor . with the application of an external magnetic field of appropriate direction and magnitude ,",
    "a pair of mbs appear at the ends of the nanowire as edge modes @xcite .",
    "as the mbs are zero energy modes , the ground - state is 2-fold degenerate .",
    "several reports have been made on experimental evidence @xcite for the existence of this type of mbs , although a complete picture of the physics of systems hosting mbs , including conclusive evidence of the topological nature of the observed ground states , remains out of reach as of yet .",
    "for the purposes of tqc , the degenerate mbs edge modes can be labelled @xmath0 in the computational basis , according to the _ parity _ of the many - body ground state , with @xmath1 referring to an even ( odd ) number of electrons .",
    "a so - called topological gap protects these states from the environment , providing an intrinsic , hardware - level protection against decoherence @xcite .",
    "logical _ majorana qubit is defined as the joint state of two mbs pairs within a particular parity manifold @xcite .",
    "we shall focus on a single mbs pair here , as readout of a logical qubit can be constructed from pair readouts .",
    "a bit - flip operation @xmath2 can be performed by utilizing the unusual mbs property of non - abelian anyonic statistics .",
    "this involves braiding ( physically exchanging the positions of ) the two particles .",
    "the details of braiding operations were explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was also shown that these operations , as implemented in a network of quantum wires , benefit from topological error protection .",
    "however , in order to obtain a universal set of operations , one needs to supplement braiding with a set of quantum gates that are not topologically protected @xcite .",
    "several proposals exist for achieving universality , such as bringing the mbs close together to break topological protection and applying phase gates @xcite , or coupling mbs with conventional qubits @xcite .",
    "additional challenges facing the realization of tqc are state initialization and readout of the mbs parity states . following the methodology of the @xmath3 fractional quantum hall system@xcite ,",
    "a creation / annihilation approach was suggested by alicea et al .",
    "@xcite , wherein a pair of mbs are created from the vacuum of the underlying quantum field , braided to perform computation , and then fused ( annihilated ) to create either vacuum or a finite energy quasiparticle ( i.e. a dirac fermion ) , depending on the parity state of the mbs .",
    "the extra quasiparticle can be detected by some form of charge measurement .",
    "there are also recent proposals for readout based on monitoring the current - phase relation of a josephson junction hosting an mbs pair @xcite , coupling mbs to flux @xcite or transmon @xcite qubits , and coupling to charge or spin states of quantum dots @xcite .",
    "all of these methods rely on some form of parity - to - charge conversion , and also necessarily take the mbs out of the topologically protected regime by breaking the degeneracy of the parity states .",
    "this can be achieved by reducing the spatial separation of the two mbs so their wavefunctions overlap @xcite , or by using long - range coulomb control interactions @xcite on a superconducting island hosting the mbs .",
    "charge state coherence during the parity - to - charge conversion operation is generally required .    in this paper",
    ", we propose and theoretically model a readout scheme that is relevant to the setup of mbs tunnel coupled to a quantum dot ( qd ) .",
    "previous theoretical work has demonstrated the power and versatility of the mbs - qd system for detecting the presence @xcite and lifetime @xcite of topological order , gate - driven manipulation of topological qubits @xcite and coherent transfer to dot spin and dot charge states . in a realization based on a top - gated two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , for example",
    ", the mbs - qd setup is natural and could lead to a scalable architecture for topological qubits .",
    "while parity measurement was mentioned in the mbs - qd context @xcite , to our knowledge , no detailed study has been conducted to validate the experimental feasibility of such a readout scheme .",
    "our setup involves an mbs pair , a qd isolated from any reservoir , and a charge sensor to measure the qd charge state . as there are no reservoirs present , the joint parity state of the qd + mbs system is conserved . by reducing the spatial separation of the two mbs ( e.g. with a set of keyboard gates ) ,",
    "the overlap of the mbs wavefunctions grow , resulting in an energy splitting between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states .",
    "this splitting is oscillatory and has an exponential envelope versus the mbs separation @xcite .",
    "the qd level is tuned so that a charge transition is on resonance with a target mbs energy splitting , allowing mbs @xmath6 qd charge transport to occur for one parity state but not the other . similar to other schemes ,",
    "we assume a coherent charge transfer process .",
    "finally , the charge state of the qd is projectively measured with a charge sensor such as a single electron transistor ( set ) @xcite .    numerical simulations with realistic system parameters",
    "show that this setup can be used to map out the energy splitting between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states versus the spatial separation of the mbs pair ( or as a function of chemical potential or external magnetic field ) .",
    "such a signature has been cited as  smoking gun \" evidence for topological order , and could also open avenues for studying the robustness of the topological state to domain wall motion .",
    "the charge transfer in our scheme can be performed on a fast timescale of @xmath7 nanoseconds with a high theoretical fidelity of @xmath8 .",
    "these attributes can be further improved , but at a cost in the precision of voltage and timing controls .",
    "the isolation of the qd from reservoirs leads to a resonance in the tunneling probability versus gate voltage that is typically very sharp , and controlled only by the tunneling rate .",
    "while this requires some fine tuning of control parameters , it is very effective at decoupling the mbs and qd when readout is not being performed .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , a model for the mbs pair coupled on one end to a qd is presented . in section [ sec : splitting ] , we show how this setup can be used to experimentally determine the energy splitting between the mbs parity states as a function of their spatial separation . the mbs parity measurement is numerically studied and discussed in section [ sec : readout ] , and concluding remarks are presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "initially in the @xmath5 state , the @xmath166 @xmath107 transition is on resonance , and an electron will tunnel from the topological wire to the dot with transition probability very close to one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : readout]b ) .    if , however , the mbs was initially in the @xmath4 state , changing the parity state will _ cost _ ( rather than supply ) an energy @xmath145 . the corresponding process ,",
    "@xmath167 , is off resonance  its resonant gate voltage is @xmath168 . for the @xmath4 parity state then , the procedure illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig : readout ] would result in an electron transfer probability very close to zero .",
    "stage ( iii ) : the reverse of stage ( i ) , the gate voltage is rapidly ramped back to @xmath96 and the keyboard gates are used to move the left mbs back to its initial position .",
    "note that , whereas sweeping @xmath12 away from the resonance point is necessary in order to prevent the electron from tunneling back to the mbs , moving the left mbs with the keyboard gates is not always required .",
    "it is included here to allow the system to recover its initial configuration , in case the cycle is repeated . at this point , a charge measurement of the dot is performed via the charge sensor , e.g. set .",
    "a measurement outcome of @xmath39 indicates with high probability that the initial mbs state was @xmath5 while a measurement of @xmath38 indicates with high probability that the initial mbs state was @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the dot charge measurement amounts to a projective measurement in the mbs parity basis . + _ fidelity of readout _  using the parameters given previously and with @xmath169ev , the numerically obtained probability of finding @xmath39 electrons on the dot after stage ( iii ) is greater than @xmath170 with the mbs initially in @xmath5 .",
    "the probability of finding @xmath38 electrons is greater than @xmath171 with the mbs initially in @xmath4 .",
    "the readout scheme therefore allows the two mbs states to be distinguished with a visibility up to 0.9996 , defined simply as the smaller of the two probabilities above .",
    "the term ` readout fidelity ' is used interchangeably with this measure of visibility .",
    "the residual error is dominated by the finite voltage ramping time : a faster ramp would increase the visibility . however , so far we havent considered limitations on control precision ( discussed below ) , which in practice lead to lower fidelities .",
    "+ _ readout timescale _  the timescale for the parity - dependent mbs @xmath6 qd tunneling , including sweeping @xmath12 and moving the left mbs , can be as fast as 25 ns for experimentally feasible parameters ( see figure [ fig : readout ] ) .",
    "however , single - charge readout of the qd state requires integration times in the range of @xmath172s @xcite to @xmath173s @xcite or longer , and bottlenecks the mbs parity readout process .",
    "+ _ bias in parity readout due to miscalibration _",
    " throughout the readout operation ( stages i - iii ) , it was assumed that the calibration of @xmath76 performed in section [ sec : subsec_varied_l ] is valid .",
    "drift or noise in the applied voltage or pulse timing will cause miscalibration errors and bias the charge measurement outcome in favour of @xmath38 over @xmath39 ( see figure [ fig : optimize ] ) , i.e. a bias towards detecting @xmath4 over @xmath174 for the mbs parity .",
    "however , a straightforward modification of our scheme allows for distinguishing a calibration error from a genuine @xmath4 outcome .",
    "this is done by appending a second readout operation involving the @xmath43 charge state of the qd .    starting with @xmath12 at @xmath153 ,",
    "i.e. halfway between the @xmath154 and @xmath175 charge degeneracy points of the qd , two parity - to - charge conversions are attempted : first , @xmath176 , by using the resonance at gate voltage @xmath177 as described previously .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath178 transition is made resonant at @xmath179 .",
    "then , the charge sensor is used to perform a charge readout of the qd .",
    "the following outcomes can be distinguished : @xmath39 electrons indicates with high probability that the initial mbs state was @xmath5 , while @xmath43 indicates @xmath4 .",
    "the outcome @xmath38 indicates that neither transition took place ( i.e. a calibration error ) , thus providing an _ in situ _",
    "test for the validity of the readout procedure .",
    "+ _ sensitivity to precision of control _",
    " for the system parameters chosen in our simulations , the mbs separation @xmath23 must be controlled within approximately 1 nm in order to maintain an accuracy @xmath8 in distinguishing the parity outcomes .",
    "the tolerance can be improved by about a factor of three by choosing parameters at the edge of the topological phase region that correspond to about three times longer period for the mbs energy oscillations  however such a case is far less typical .",
    "alternatively , the effect of tunnel broadening may be exploited to reduce the sharpness of the resonance condition and increase robustness .",
    "for example , we solved the tdse again with a tunnel coupling strength of 1 ghz , corresponding to  readout - 2 \" in table [ table:2-rates ] .",
    "this shows that the stronger tunnel coupling allows a tolerance of @xmath180 nm in precision of the mbs location while still maintaining a readout fidelity of @xmath181 , at the cost of reducing @xmath105 by a factor of 10 .",
    "however , a @xmath182 nm error in the case of the 100 mhz tunnel coupling yields a dramatically lower visibility of @xmath183 . hence , there is a tradeoff between the required precision of spatial control of the mbs separation versus the timing precision of gate voltage control .",
    "we examined theoretically a protocol to read out the parity of an mbs pair in a topological superconductor using an isolated quantum dot .",
    "the mbs pair is brought from a well - separated ( topologically protected ) state to a spatially overlapping ( unprotected ) state in which there is a finite energy splitting ; one mbs is then resonantly tunnel coupled with the quantum dot . the mbs parity state is projectively measured by a charge measurement of the quantum dot , and we showed that this can be accomplished , in principle , with high fidelity . it is straightforward to extend this to the readout of a logical qubit based on two mbs pairs .",
    "this protocol fits naturally into the mbs - dot system , which could be a powerful and versatile setting for achieving scalable control of topological qubits .    as an intermediate step",
    ", we discussed a calibration procedure for mapping out the mbs energy splitting versus separation , @xmath76 .",
    "the result of such an experiment is predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite and confirmation of this would be strong evidence for the presence of topological order .",
    "it would also allow testing the robustness of the mbs state against gate - driven motion of the topological domain wall .",
    "as with any projective measurement , the protocol can also be used to prepare the mbs into a desired parity eigenstate .",
    "the key for both readout and state preparation is that parity eigenstates should be preserved under adiabatic motion of the topological wire .",
