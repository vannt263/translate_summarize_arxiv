    "if we can choose o and ne lines whose @xmath16 functions have very similar temperature dependence , an abundance ratio by number , @xmath22 , can be derived simply from the ratio of their observed line fluxes , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , since all the temperature - dependent terms in equation  [ e : flux ] cancel : @xmath25 an early study of ne / o ratios in solar active regions@xcite used the ratio of ne  ix @xmath26 to o  viii @xmath27 .",
    "this ratio does , however , have some significant residual dependence on temperature.@xcite here we remove much of this temperature dependence by addition of ne  x @xmath28 ; our combined ne @xmath16 function is @xmath29 . the resulting ratio @xmath30 is illustrated as a function of temperature in figure  [ f : emissrat ] .",

    "the fe  xvii 12.12    contribution was estimated by scaling the observed strengths of unblended fe  xvii lines at 15.26 , 16.77 , 17.05 and 17.09    ( the strong 15.01    resonance line was omitted to avoid potential problems with its depletion through resonance scattering ) by their theoretical line strengths relative to the 12.12    line as predicted by the chianti database .",
    "minor blending in the wings of the ne  ix  13.447    line was accounted for by fitting simultaneously with the neighbouring weaker lines , comprised of a fe  xix - xxi blend at 13.424    and fe  xix 13.465   , following a detailed study of these features in the capella binary system.@xcite since these blend corrections are generally very small , the uncertainties in these procedures have negligible ( @xmath37% ) influence on the derived ne / o abundance ratios .",

    "<S> precise agreement between helioseismological measurements and predictions of theoretical solar models@xcite has been a triumph of modern astrophysics . however , a recent downward revision by 25 - 35%  of the solar abundances of light elements such as c , n , o and ne@xcite has broken this accordance : </S>",
    "<S> models adopting the new abundances incorrectly predict the depth of the convection zone , the depth profiles of sound speed and density , and the helium abundance.@xcite the discrepancies are far beyond the uncertainties in either the data or the model predictions.@xcite here we report on neon abundances relative to oxygen measured in a sample of nearby solar - like stars from their x - ray spectra . </S>",
    "<S> they are all very similar and substantially larger than the recently revised solar value . </S>",
    "<S> the neon abundance in the sun is quite poorly determined . </S>",
    "<S> if the ne / o abundance in these stars is adopted for the sun the models are brought back into agreement with helioseismology measurements.@xcite    harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics , 60 garden street , cambridge ma 02138 , usa .    </S>",

    "<S> the role of the sun as a fundamental benchmark of stellar evolution theory , which itself underpins much of astrophysics , renders the `` solar model problem '' one of some importance . </S>",
    "<S> the schism between helioseismology and models with a revised composition has arisen because abundant elements such as c , n , o and ne provide major contributions to the opacity of the solar interior , which in turn influences internal structure and the depth at which the interior becomes convective . </S>",
    "<S> uncertainties in the calculated opacities themselves appear insufficient to bridge the gap,@xcite and the propriety of the recent abundance revisions has therefore been questioned .    </S>",
    "<S> the revised abundances are demanded by new analyses of the visible solar spectrum that take into account convection and associated velocity fields and temperature inhomogeneities through 3-d hydrodynamic modelling , and that relax the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium for computing atomic level populations.@xcite the solar abundances of c , n and o can be measured accurately based on their absorption lines . </S>",
    "<S> however , ne lacks detectable photospheric lines in cool stars like the sun , and the ne abundance is therefore much less certain . </S>",
    "<S> the solar ne content is assessed based on observations of neon ions in nebular and hot star spectra , and on measurements of solar energetic particles.@xcite measurements are generally made relative to a reference element such as o ; the downward revision of the solar o abundance therefore required a commensurate lowering of the ne abundance for consistency.@xcite expressed as the ratio of the number of ne atoms in the gas to those of o , this abundance is @xmath0 , which is very similar to values adopted in earlier studies.@xcite however , it has recently been pointed out that the solar model problem could be solved were the true solar ne abundance to be at least a factor of 2.5 times higher than recently assessed.@xcite    we are motivated by the solar model problem to investigate ne abundances in nearby stars . while not detected in the optical spectra of cool stars , emission lines of highly ionised ne are prominent features of their x - ray spectra.@xcite the ne / o abundance ratio can be derived directly from the ratio of observed fluxes of the hydrogen - like and helium - like ions of o and ne ( see methods for details ) ; we adopt a slightly refined version of the method applied to the analysis of earlier solar x - ray spectra.@xcite in this way , we have obtained the ne / o abundance ratios for a sample of 21 stars lying within 100pc of the sun that have been observed by the _ </S>",

    "<S> the stars studied , together with observed ne and o line fluxes and derived ne / o abundance ratios are listed in table  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the ne / o abundance ratios are illustrated as a function of the ratio of logarithmic x - ray and bolometric luminosities , @xmath1a commonly used index of stellar coronal activity  in figure  [ f : abunrats ] . since our star sample contains more objects toward higher @xmath1 , we have added ne / o ratios for two stars of somewhat lower activity level ( procyon , an f5 subgiant , and @xmath2  eri , a k2 dwarf ) from the literature.@xcite there is no trend in the ne / o abundance ratio with @xmath1 , and the error - weighted mean ratio is @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> our derived ne / o abundance ratio is 2.7 times higher than the currently recommended solar value@xcite but is consistent with the abundance inferred from helioseismology.@xcite solving the solar model problem by raising the ne abundance alone would require a minimum ratio @xmath4 , or 3.44 times larger than recommended.@xcite however , raising the c , n , o and fe abundances upward within their estimated uncertainty range of @xmath5%  ( adjusting them all together is not unreasonable because the recent downward revisions are correlated ) would require an ne abundance higher by only a factor of 2.5@xcite  quite within our estimated range .    extensive review articles on the coronae of the sun and stars document evidence that coronal chemical compositions often appear different to those thought to characterise the underlying photospheres.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> the differences appear to relate to element first ionisation potentials ( fips ) : the solar corona appears enhanced in elements with low fip ( @xmath6  ev ; e.g. , mg , si fe),@xcite whereas much more coronally active stars appear to have depletions in low fip elements and perhaps enrichments of high fip elements ( @xmath6  ev ; e.g. , o , ne , ar).@xcite at first sight , this chemical fractionation might render direct interpretation of coronal abundance ratios in terms of the composition of the underlying star problematic . </S>",
    "<S> however , that we are seeing the same ne / o ratio in a wide variety of stars sampling a large range of different coronal activity levels indicates that there is no significant fractionation between o and ne in disk - integrated light from stellar coronae . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to conclude that the results represent the true ne / o abundance ratios of these stars . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is bolstered by findings of a constant ne / o abundance ratio , in good agreement with our value , for a small sample of single and active binary stars observed by _ xmm - newton_.@xcite in view of the consistency of the ne / o abundance ratio in nearby stars , it seems likely that the solar ratio should be similar .    </S>",
    "<S> there are no recent full - disk integrated light ne / o measurements for the sun ; existing studies are instead based on observations of particular regions and structures of the solar outer atmosphere . we provide a tabular summary and bibliography of some of the different ne / o estimates since 1974 as supplementary information to this letter . </S>",
    "<S> while the preponderance of estimates appear consistent with current assessments , the underlying observations do not sample photospheric material . </S>",
    "<S> the ne / o ratio is in fact observed to differ substantially between the different observations . in particular , the highest measured ne / o ratios based on x - ray lines are 2 - 3 times the accepted solar value and are compatible with the abundance ratio we find for nearby stars . </S>",
    "<S> these higher ne / o ratios were obtained for hotter active regions@xcite that are likely to dominate the solar full - disk x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements are the most directly compatible with the ones presented here based on full - disk integrated light x - ray spectra of stars . </S>",
    "<S> similarly `` high '' ne / o ratios have also been seen in @xmath7-ray observations of flares , @xmath8he - rich solar energetic particle events , and in the decay phase of long duration soft x - ray events.@xcite the @xmath7-ray measurements probe material that is irradiated by downward - flowing accelerated particles.@xcite the particle beams penetrate through to the chromosphere which is likely more representative of the underlying photospheric material than coronal regions .    </S>",
    "<S> recent sophisticated models of heliospheric pickup ion and anomalous cosmic ray populations from the local interstellar medium are also inconsistent with the current solar ne / o abundance ratio , but could be reconciled by raising this to @xmath9,@xcite which is similar to our values for nearby stars . </S>",
    "<S> this ne / o ratio is somewhat higher than the mean from studies of ionized nebulae in the milky way and other galaxies , but falls within the scatter of results at solar metallicity.@xcite    the implication of our study , then , is that the higher of the observed solar ne / o abundance ratios are the ones representative of the underlying solar composition . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is in accordance with our observations of ne / o in nearby stars and reconciles solar models with helioseismology . </S>"
