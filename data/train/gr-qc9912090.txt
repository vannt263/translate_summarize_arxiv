    "the causal relation @xmath0 was introduced in @xcite to extend elements of standard global analysis concerning @xmath1 lorentzian metrics to those which are only @xmath2 .",
    "the main obstruction to such an extension within the framework of standard causal analysis is that the existence of the convex normal neighbourhoods is not guaranteed so that compactness of the space of causal curves can not be proved in the usual way @xcite .",
    "the alternate causal relation @xmath0 was used in @xcite to construct an appropriate compactness theorem in the @xmath2 case .",
    "one of the original motivations of the work in @xcite was to develop a causal analysis that would work in spacetimes with degeneracies . indeed ,",
    "while the usual chronological and causal relations are ill - defined at the degeneracies , @xmath0 can be naturally extended to cover these points as claimed in @xcite .",
    "this present paper has grown out of our interest in the causal structure of causal lorentzian topology changing spacetimes , which necessarily possess degeneracies @xcite . traditionally , such degeneracies are excised from the spacetime , so that what remains is a globally lorentzian spacetime .",
    "this was the procedure followed in @xcite , to examine the causal continuity of morse spacetimes .",
    "one way to incorporate the degeneracies in the overall causal structure would be to treat them as the boundaries of the spacetime , in the sense of @xcite .",
    "this procedure , however , is not without ambiguities .",
    "since @xmath0 can be defined in the degenerate spacetimes directly , it seems to be a promising alternative . in this paper ,",
    "our main aim is to make sense of @xmath0 in topology changing morse spacetimes which possess isolated degeneracies . along the way",
    ", we demonstrate a number of interesting properties of @xmath0 in both globally lorentzian spacetimes and those with isolated degeneracies .",
    "an outline of our results is as follows . in the first section",
    "we briefly review some standard definitions of causal analysis before introducing the relation @xmath0 .",
    "we then demonstrate that in a globally lorentzian spacetime , @xmath0 is stable to certain changes in the chronological relation @xmath7 on which it is defined . for a @xmath1 globally lorentzian spacetime @xmath8 ,",
    "we show that @xmath0 changes minimally when we remove a set @xmath9 of isolated points from @xmath10 , namely , @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath0 thus appears to be `` robust '' to such changes .",
    "next , we demonstrate that in a stably causal globally lorentzian spacetime @xmath0 is precisely the seifert relation @xmath12 which provides us with an intuitive picture of @xmath0 .",
    "we then show that in globally lorentzian spacetimes , the hawking and sachs criterion for causal continuity @xcite is equivalent to the condition , @xmath13 for all @xmath14 , which in turn is equivalent to the statement that @xmath15 constitute a _ causal structure _ , as defined by penrose and kronheimer @xcite .    in the second section , we examine the special case of morse spacetimes .",
    "when the degeneracies are excised , we show that in a morse spacetimes for which the morse function has only one critical value , @xmath16 coincides with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the condition for causal continuity is shown to be equivalent to inner continuity of @xmath19 .",
    "we then reinstate the degeneracies and show that again , @xmath0 is unaltered by changes in the chronological relation .",
    "we conjecture that the @xmath0 s in the spacetimes with and without the degeneracies are related in a particular way and propose a definition of `` k - causal continuity '' in the unpunctured spacetime .",
    "we then show that the above conjecture implies the k - causal continuity in the spacetime with the degeneracies is equivalent to the causal continuity of the spacetime with the degeneracies excised .",
    "we also show that , independently of whether the conjecture holds , index @xmath20 and @xmath21 morse spacetimes are k - causally discontinuous , as expected @xcite .    in the final section we speculate on the relationship between our work and the idea that spacetime is fundamentally discrete @xcite .",
    "for example , the presence or absence of an isolated point in our continuum approximations should be irrelevant as far as any underlying discrete causal structure goes .",
    "because of its apparent robustness , the relation @xmath0 seems a reasonable candidate to bridge the gap between continuous and discrete causal structures .",

    "the case of most interest to us is that of topology changing morse spacetimes . to make further progress , it is necessary for us to prove that causal continuity of a degenerate spacetime can be characterised entirely in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "ultimately , topology changing processes can only be analysed with rigour in a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "any seemingly ad hoc rules governing topology change should be justified by appealing to the more basic theory .",
    "underlying our analysis , then , is the idea that perhaps the causal order of a spacetime is its most fundamental aspect .",
    "this is the basis of the causal set hypothesis @xcite that the fundamental discrete ( quantum ) substructure of spacetime is described by a causal set .",
    "the question thus arises : can any sense be made at the discrete level of a continuum notion like causal continuity ? in a sense we have been working towards this in this paper  framing conditions in terms of the @xmath0 relation alone and independently of @xmath7 , for example , could be seen as moving in this direction , since a causal set possesses a causal relation but not a chronological one .",
    "basic to the causal set hypothesis is the notion of `` manifold - like '' causal sets which can be obtained by sprinkling points at random , with a fixed density , into a lorentzian manifold and using the spacetime causal order to define the partial order on the set of sprinkled points .",
    "we can pursue the question of whether causal continuity makes sense in a causal set by asking what a causal set that arises from sprinkling into causally discontinuous spacetimes looks like .",
    "a preliminary investigation suggests that causal discontinuity might manifest itself in the causal set in the existence of a point @xmath14 in the set and a single link from @xmath14 , the severing of which would result in a big change in the causal future or past of @xmath14 in the causal set . what is meant by big change and whether this can be made more concrete is left for future work .",
