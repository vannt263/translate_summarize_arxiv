    "nonleptonic weak decays of heavy baryons arouse people s great interest since they provide a good area to understand the standard model ( sm ) and search new physics ( np ) beyond the sm . for the branching ratios of @xmath3 and @xmath1 decays ,",

    "the authors used the generalized and naive factorization approaches to handle the hadronic matrix elements , respectively .",
    "however , the branching ratios for these two decay modes are significantly lower than the present experiment values . specially in ref . [ 3 ] , the measured branching ratio for @xmath3 could be easily accommodated in the fourth quark generation model . in this paper , using the qcd factorization approach , we shall discuss the branching ratios for @xmath3 and @xmath1 decays in a flavor changing @xmath2 model @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we shall discuss the nonleptonic decays of @xmath18 baryon . in section 3",
    ", we shall analyze these decay modes in a flavor changing @xmath2 model .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions .",

    "( 1 ) , we can find that the branching ratios of @xmath56 and @xmath1 decays are lower than the present experimental values at about @xmath57 level .",
    "a flavor changing @xmath2 model can lead to fcnc processes at the tree level due to the non - diagonal chiral coupling matrix , and the formalism of the model has been discussed explicitly in refs . [ 4 , 5 ] . here",
    "we shall briefly review the ingredients needed in this paper .",

    "the diagonal elements of the effective matrices @xmath64 are real due to the hermiticity of the effective hamiltonian .",

    "case i : considering the left - handed and right - handed couplings are equal , i.e. , @xmath73 ; and case ii : only considering the left - handed couplings and neglecting the right - handed couplings , i.e. , @xmath74 . for each case , we shall take @xmath4 and @xmath75 as representative values for numerical analysis as in ref .",
