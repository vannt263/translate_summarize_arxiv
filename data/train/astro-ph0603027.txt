    "low - mass stars of all stages of evolution  from protostars to the main sequence  emit x - rays ( see , e.g. , feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) .",
    "the relationships between the levels of x - ray emission and stellar properties for pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars are , however , very different from the well established correlations between rotation , rossby number , and x - ray emission seen in young main - sequence stars ( e.g. , stauffer et  al .",
    "1994 , micela et  al .  1996 ,",
    "pizzolato et  al .",
    "several factors may contribute to these differences .",
    "low - mass pms stars are fully convective during their early evolution , and differences in stellar structure ( convective in the pms phase vs. radiative core , convective envelope on the zams ) are likely to produce different levels of magnetic - field - related activity .",
    "many pms stars are still surrounded by accretion disks , which may influence x - ray emission in at least three ways .",
    "additional x - ray emmission above coronal levels may be produced in accretion shocks or wind / jet shocks ( e.g. , kastner et  al .  2002 , 2005 ; guedel et  al .",
    "depending on the system orientation and the size of disk ( and extent of flaring ) , disks or neutral winds may absorb x - ray photons , decreasing the detected flux , particularly at short wavelengths ( e.g. , kastner et  al .",
    "2005 ; walter & kuhi 1981 ) .",
    "the rotation speed of pms stars could , in principle , also affect x - ray emission .",
    "if so , then the x - ray properties of stars surrounded by accretion disks may differ systematically from their counterparts that lack disks , owing to the effects of `` disk locking '' on rotation ( _ e.g. _ , shu et  al.1987 , 2000 ; knigl 1991 , 1989 ) .",
    "finally , there might also be other less direct interactions between accretion , the young stellar object , its outer convective zone , the magnetic field structures , and the x - ray emitting plasma , as discussed in preibisch et  al .",
    ".    the recent coup project ( getman et  al .",
    "2005 ) has investigated the detailed relationships among stellar parameters and x - ray flux among solar - like pms stars in the onc ( preibisch et  al.2005 ) , which has an age of @xmath00.5 myr .",
    "we consider here the relationships among rotation , x - rays , and disks for several hundred stars in the orion flanking fields ( @xmath01 myr ) and ngc 2264 ( @xmath03 myr ) .",
    "we focus our analysis on objects of masses @xmath00.3 to 2.5 m@xmath4 .",
    "the stars in these regions are , on average , slightly older than those in the onc and are therefore , in combination with the coup data , well - suited for searching for changes during the early evolution of pms stars .",
    "importantly , for stars of @xmath01 - 2 m@xmath4 , the current sample includes stars spanning the range of ages in which substantial structural changes take place as stars evolve from a fully convective phase to a phase in which they develop radiative cores and convective envelopes .",
    "since the origin of the x - rays in the sun is believed to be linked to dynamo - driven activity , we might expect that the mechanism of magnetic field and consequent coronal x - ray generation changes as stars make the transition from a fully convective state to one in which a radiative core is surrounded by a thin convective envelope .",
    "consequently , we might also expect to see a change in the x - ray properties .",
    "the basic presentation of the data for the orion ff and ngc 2264 appears in other papers ( ramirez et  al .",
    "2004a , b ; flaccomio et  al .  2005a , b ) ; we discuss here the implications of these data . after a brief summary of the observations (  [ sec : obs ] ) , we consider in some detail the completeness and selection effects of the sample of stars to be discussed here .",
    "then we compare the relationships of log @xmath1  and log @xmath1/@xmath2  (  [ sec : lxlbol ] ) with mass and age for stars on convective tracks in all three clusters and find that the relationships are entirely consistent , thereby indicating that there is little or no evolution in x - ray properties during the first @xmath05 myr of evolution down convective tracks .",
    "we find clear evidence for a decrease in log @xmath1/@xmath2  when stars make the transition from convective to radiative tracks (  [ sec : oldmass ] ) .",
    "we also discuss the sample with rotation information (  [ sec : rotation ] ) , and find that the subset of stars with measured periods has on average significantly higher values of log @xmath1/@xmath2 , as was found previously for the onc ( preibish et  al .",
    "also in accordance with previous studies , we find no clear trends of x - ray emission with rotation among the sample having spot - modulated periods . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : disks ] , we examine the relation between disks , mass accretion rate ( inferred from ultraviolet excess emission ) and x - ray luminosity ; we find no clear trends .",
    "in this paper , we discuss stars detected in four chandra / acis fields : two in ngc 2264 and two in the outer orion nebula region , the so - called `` orion flanking fields '' ( ff ; see rebull et  al .  2000 , rebull 2001 for more discussion of these fields ) .",

    "( 2000 ) , using the stars positions in the dereddened @xmath15 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , we calculated @xmath2  following the precepts summarized by hillenbrand ( 1997 ) .",
    "similarly , we assigned masses to the stars according to the two different sets of pms stellar models : ( 1 ) those of dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 , 1998 ; dam ) , with conversion from the theoretical to the observational plane ( including calculation of @xmath2 ) using transformations found in hillenbrand ( 1997 ) ; and ( 2 ) those of siess et  al .",
    "( 2000 ; sdf ) , the z=0.02 model with no overshooting , using conversions from kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) .",
    "the dam models are what we have used in previous papers ( e.g. , rebull et  al .",
    "2000 ) , but the sdf models were used by coup ( preibisch et  al .",
    "2005b ) ; masses from both models are discussed here to facilitate comparison with these and other papers .",
    "if stars fell outside the grid provided by the models , no masses or ages were assigned ; such stars were excluded from this analysis .",

    "et  al .  ( 2004b ) , we have found that the x - ray selected sample in orion ff ( @xmath01 myr ) is on average slightly older than that for the onc ( @xmath00.5 myr ) , but not as old as that for ngc 2264 ( @xmath03 myr ) . repeating this analysis now including the second ngc 2264 field",
    ", it is still the case that the median age of the ff sample is older than the onc , and ngc 2264 is older still .",
    "the _ range _ of ages found within _",
    "each _ of these clusters is on the order of @xmath03 myr and comparable in all three clusters , with the largest _ fraction _ of older stars being found in ngc 2264 ; see figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "the ages listed here ( 0.5 , 1 , and 3 myr ) are obtained from comparing distributions of ages derived using dam models for the `` best possible sample '' ( see next subsection below ) for these clusters . if we use sdf models for the same subset of stars , we find ages that are on average older by @xmath01 myr , but the relative age placement of the clusters is similar at 1.5 , 2 , and 4 myr .",
    "the relative placement of the clusters is also consistent with the relative numbers of radiative and convective stars ( see below ) ; the fewest radiative stars are found in the onc and the most are found in ngc 2264 .      in order to interpret our x - ray data",
    ", we have to include data from the ancillary data catalog ( adc ) .",
    "however , we can not simply take all of the adc data merged with the x - ray data and proceed .",
    "not all stars have a complete set of data in the adc , and there is a wide range of adc survey depths among our sample clusters . in this section ,",
    "we describe what kinds of data we require for a given star to appear in subsequent analysis in this paper . in the end",
    ", we settle on a sample which we will hereafter refer to as the `` best possible sample '' ( as defined below and summarized in table  [ tab : bestposssample ] ) . within this best possible sample ,",
    "there are stars that are on radiative tracks according to either the dam or sdf models , and stars that are on convective tracks according to those models .",
    "these samples are referred to as the best possible radiative and best possible convective samples . in plots that follow , where both the radiative and convective stars appear , the radiative stars are colored red ; otherwise , the plots contain just the convective stars .",
    "the following discussion is summarized in table  [ tab : bestposssample ] , where the numbers of detections and/or upper limits are tabulated for each of a variety of criteria .",
    "while there are 416 x - ray sources detected in the orion ff and 683 sources detected in ngc 2264 ( line a in table  [ tab : bestposssample ] ) , only 84% ( 348 ) of the ff sources and 75% ( 509 ) of the ngc 2264 sources have optical and/or nir counterparts in the adc ( line b in table  [ tab : bestposssample ] ) . for determining , among other things , masses and ages , we require a @xmath16 and @xmath17 magnitude so that we can place all the stars in the same cmd and at least derive self - consistent values .",
    "there are 278 ( 67% ) of the ff x - ray detections and 465 ( 68% ) of the ngc 2264 x - ray detections meeting those criteria ( line d in table  [ tab : bestposssample ] ) .",
    "further , of those , 94% ( 261 in the ff and 438 in ngc 2264 ) are likely cluster members based on position in the sky and position in the cmd ( line e in table  [ tab : bestposssample])these objects appear in a clear `` locus '' above the zams ( see rebull et  al .  2000 , 2002 for full cmds and additional discussion ) .    of the entire set of x - ray detections , only 115 ( 27% )",
    "orion ff sources and 294 ( 52% ) ngc 2264 sources can be identified with counterparts that have known spectral types in the adc ( line c in table  [ tab : bestposssample ] ) .",
    "because of the original motivations behind the studies amassing most of these spectral types , the set of stars with types is strongly biased toward the stars with known rotational periods .",
    "as we will see below , stars with measured periods are brighter in x - rays , which therefore affects the set of stars with both x - ray detections and spectral types .    as a result of this bias",
    ", we chose _ not _ to limit our analysis here to solely the stars with spectral types . in order to minimize the chances of field star contamination , we have , however , restricted our discussion to objects ( 261 detections in the ff and 438 detections in ngc 2264 ) that are likely members based on position in the sky and in the cmd ( line e in table  [ tab : bestposssample ] ) .",
    "upper limits can be important for determining trends in complex data sets such as this .",

    "an increase of @xmath030% ) .",
    "the optical surveys of ngc 2264 incorporated into the adc are very deep and are not well - matched to the relatively shallow chandra survey . if the entire optical sample from the adc were included ( line f in table  [ tab : bestposssample ] )",
    ", the number of x - ray upper limits would dwarf the detections ( and moreover would likely be dominated by non - members ) .",

    "this adds 168 upper limits to the now - reduced 349 detections to be considered in ngc 2264 ( line h in table  [ tab : bestposssample ] ) .",
    "these restrictions should also reduce the contamination of our sample by non - members .",
    "the percentage of non - members is probably higher among stars with no detections ( because members are more likely to be bright in x - rays ) and at the faint end ( because the mass function means there are simply more low - mass stars in the field ) .",
    "this cut in @xmath17 of course has implications for the mass and age range to be considered here ; see figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "this cut eliminates stars with @xmath190.3 m@xmath4  and @xmath205 myr , using dam models .    to summarize the discussion to this point ( line h in table  [ tab : bestposssample ] ) , then , there are 261 x - ray detections with optical counterparts from the adc that are likely stellar members of the orion ff , with 84 additional upper limits .",

    "quantitatively , 14% of the detected onc stars have log @xmath1/@xmath2  @xmath31 , and 4.6% have log @xmath1/@xmath2  @xmath32 . for the orion ff , the fractions are 5% and 0.4% , respectively , and for ngc 2264 , the fractions are 7% and 0.9% respectively . in other words , there is a significantly larger number of stars with high @xmath1  and high @xmath1/@xmath2  in the younger onc .",
    "there are three possible explanations for this effect .",
    "first , it could be entirely an age effect , in that the most _ extreme _ levels of activity may decay during early pms evolution .",
    "second , it could be the intrinsic variability of the stars themselves in @xmath1 .",
    "third it could be the intrinsic variability of the stars themselves in the optical photometry that goes into the @xmath2  estimate . in either of these latter cases ,",
    "the variability could be more extreme in the younger stars , allowing for more outliers . with regards to the variability in @xmath1 ,",
    "favata et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , in studying the brightest @xmath01% of the coup flares , find some objects that flare 1 - 2 orders of magnitude , and that the characteristic times for these flares range from 10 - 400 ks . in the specific case of the coup sample , however , as preibisch & feigelson ( 2005 ) point out , the influence of individual flares on the total @xmath1reported for any one star is reduced by the long time baseline of their observations .",
    "thus , outliers solely due to flares in the coup data set are less likely than in the other ( much shorter ) observations .",
    "variability in the optical data that go into calculation of @xmath2  may account for some fraction of the outliers ; optical variability can exceed a magnitude .",
    "rebull et  al .",
    "( 2002b ) discussed the sources of these errors in detail for stars with spectral types over limited mass ranges and in regions of less reddening .",
    "for the coup sample in particular , even though reddening is a concern , spectral types are known for every object , and so it is unlikely that this can account for all ( or even most ) of the outliers .",
    "more data on time variability will be required to determine why there are more outliers with high @xmath1  in the onc .",
    "the lower envelope of the x - ray detected stars in all three regions for both @xmath1  and @xmath1/@xmath2 , however , is comparable for stars with @xmath2  similar to that of the sun , and so the decay in the _ mean _ and _ lower bounds _ of the x - ray luminosities with time during the first 5 myr of pms evolution indeed appears to be small , as preibisch & feigelson ( 2005 ) reported for the onc alone . unfortunately , because of the shallow depth of our current survey , we can not compare the lower bounds of the detections of stars with m @xmath33",
    "m@xmath4  in these three regions .",
    "since more than half the stars in our sample were detected , we can compare the _",
    "log @xmath1  and log @xmath1/@xmath2  for the best possible convective sample in all three clusters .",
    "the median log @xmath1  for the onc ( further restricted to @xmath340.16 m@xmath4to account for the difference in survey depths ) , the orion ff , and ngc 2264 are 29.55 , 29.71 , and 29.90 , respectively ; the median values of log @xmath1/@xmath2  ( in the same order ) are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "( there are some upper limits in this sample , so as a simple worst - case test , we recomputed the medians , adopting the upper limits for all stars as detections , and it does not change these median values very much . )",
    "these results are consistent with that obtained by coup for the onc . while it is true that the most luminous objects have disappeared by the age of ngc 2264 , there is not much change in the median values .",
    "we certainly do not see a significant decrease during the first 5 myr , in agreement with the preibisch & feigelson ( 2005 ) work on the onc alone .",
    "in this section , we compare the x - ray properties of low mass stars still located on fully convective tracks with those of higher mass stars , some of which appear to lie on convective tracks , while others of slightly greater age have developed radiative cores and are proceeding toward the main sequence along radiative tracks . in figure",
    "[ fig : cmd ] , the stars on radiative tracks are indicated .    in figures  [ fig : mass ] and",
    "[ fig : masssdf ] , we plot log @xmath1   and log @xmath1/@xmath2  vs.  mass , retaining the red ( radiative ) and black ( convective ) convention . among the detections , the stars on radiative tracks have lower values than their similar mass counterparts located on convective tracks ; moreover , there is a higher fraction of upper limits among the radiative stars than among the convective stars .",
    "examining solely stars with detections in ngc 2264 , the median log @xmath1/@xmath2  for all convective stars between 1 and 2.5 m@xmath4  is @xmath33.51 ; the median log @xmath1/@xmath2  for radiative stars ( over the same mass range ) is @xmath34.01 .",
    "however , many of the values for radiative stars are upper limits ; adopting the upper limits for all stars as detections at the level of their upper limits , the median log @xmath1/@xmath2  for the convective stars changes subtly to @xmath33.54 , while the median for the radiative stars changes to @xmath34.48 . by assigning the upper limits to be `` detections , '' we of course obtain a conservative limit on the median log @xmath1/@xmath2",
    "; even so , the medians for the convective and radiative samples differ by a factor of 10 .",
    "evidently the transition from a fully convective state to a radiative - core convective envelope configuration results in a dramatic decrease in coronal activity as diagnosed by x - rays ; gagne et  al .",

    "2003b ) .",
    "we have examined the coup data to search for a similar trend among the onc sample .",
    "unfortunately , because the region is younger , too few stars have evolved to their radiative phases to enable a convincing test .",
    "preibisch et  al .",

    "spearman s correlation coefficient does not find any significant correlations in our data for the orion ff and ngc 2264 . however , we note that our survey covers a much smaller mass range than coup . restricting the comparison with coup data to the same mass range reveals no clear trends in either sample . because our data are dominated at low masses by upper limits , we are also unable to search for mass - dependent differences in log @xmath1/@xmath2  as reported by flaccomio et  al .",

    "we now examine each of these requirements for ngc 2264 , which has the largest number of massive stars in apparent post - convective evolution .",
    "how accurately have we located these stars in the hr diagram ?",
    "these stars are among the brightest stars in the cluster , and for 94% of the radiative stars ( both detections and upper limits ) , we have spectral types ; they range in type from a0 to k4 .",
    "because we have types , we are able to deredden each star individually with a correction appropriate to that specific star . therefore",
    ", the placement of these stars in the dereddened cmd would appear to be as secure as possible for young ( often variable ) stars .",
    "these stars appear in the correct vertical position to be taken as cluster members ; they do not appear significantly above or below the zams for a cluster at the distance of ngc 2264 .",
    "we therefore believe that most of these stars are members based on position in the hrd .",
    "because these stars are among the brighter stars in the cluster , we have preliminary proper motions ( see rebull et  al .",
    "2002 ) for 54% of the stars on radiative tracks ; 33% of the red points ( detections and upper limits ) in figure  [ fig : cmd ] ( dam models ) are likely members , 22% are likely non - members , and the rest have no proper motion membership information available . of the available sample , at least 60% of the stars are thus members based on proper motions .",
    "another indicator of likely membership is the presence of a circumstellar disk .",
    "seventy percent of the best possible radiative sample has positive circumstellar and/or accretion disk indicators , suggesting at least 70% of the sample are indeed members .",
    "are unresolved binaries important ?",
    "they may play a role , particularly in the case of x - rays where low - mass companions can outshine their primaries .",
    "however , what we have shown is that the fluxes of the stars on radiative tracks are systematically _ lower _ than those of stars with similar masses on convective tracks .",
    "if optically fainter companions do contribute some of the flux , then the discrepancy must be even larger .    in summary ,",
    "then , we believe that most ( @xmath3870% ) of the best possible radiative sample are indeed cluster members . we therefore conclude that there is a significant decrease in x - ray luminosity as stars of similar mass evolve from convective tracks , where log @xmath1/@xmath2  values lie close to the  saturation limit , \" to radiative tracks , where @xmath1/@xmath2values are @xmath010 times smaller . in support of this result",
    "we note two additional observations : 1 ) the apparent ` bifurcation ' in @xmath1/@xmath2  disappears for masses lower than about 0.5 m@xmath4 which is approximately the mass below which stars remain fully convective from the stellar birthline to the zams ; and 2 ) the levels of @xmath1  and @xmath1/@xmath2  for stars on radiative tracks are roughly in agreement with the values found in this mass range in the nexxus survey of nearby field stars ( schmitt & liefke 2004 ) .",

    "note that , for the near - ir disk indicators , redder colors suggest disks , whereas for @xmath77 , bluer colors suggest accretion .",
    "the placement of the disk cutoffs is discussed in rebull et  al .",
    "( 2002 , 2000 ) , along with comparison of the disk indicators for the same stars .",
    "there is a very large amount of scatter in these two figures , plus their companions ( @xmath42  and h@xmath40 ) which are not shown , although the scatter is somewhat smaller in the plots with log @xmath1/@xmath2  than in the plots against log @xmath1 .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen to show only the box plot representations of these data .",
    "no statistically significant or consistent trends are seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lxikx ] or [ fig : lxuvx ] ( or in similar plots with the other available disk indicators ) . in stars",
    "_ without _ evidence for disks , we find examples of stars in which @xmath1  is high and log @xmath1/@xmath2  is close to @xmath33 , but comparable large values are not seen in stars _ with _ disks or active accretion .",
    "the upper bound on both the total and fractional x - ray luminosity appears to decrease with increasing @xmath75excess for ngc 2264 ( but not the ff ) and in increasing @xmath77excess for the ff ( but not ngc 2264 ) .",
    "the x - ray fluxes do not appear to depend on @xmath42  excess for either cluster or in h@xmath40 for ngc 2264 .",
    "these confusing , inconsistent results suggest that if there is any trend , it is subtle , and , despite the numbers of points we have ( see table  [ tab : numdisks ] ) , we require many more data points to securely detect it .",
    "lllll @xmath75  excess & 129 ( 38 ) & 109 ( 37 ) & 226 ( 42 ) & 63 ( 21 ) + @xmath42  excess & 171 ( 56 ) & 64 ( 15 ) & 236 ( 56 ) & 52 ( 15 ) + @xmath77  excess & 28 ( 4 ) & 25 ( 3 ) & 87 ( 14 ) & 151 ( 48 ) + h@xmath40 eqw & & & 77 ( 8) & 46 ( 12 ) +    figure  [ fig : mdot ] looks for correlations explicitly with log @xmath78  as derived from the @xmath77  excess as in rebull et  al.(2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "the data in the orion ff are too sparse to reach any conclusion . for ngc 2264",
    ", however , there may be evidence of a trend : the upper envelope of @xmath1/@xmath2  is near @xmath79 for stars with accretion rates @xmath80 @xmath78  yr@xmath73 , but progressively decreases by nearly a factor of 10 for stars with higher accretion rates  a result in concordance with previously reported anti - correlations between x - ray luminosity and accretion for solar - like pms stars .",
    "it is perhaps surprising that there are no clear correlations of x - ray emission with either the presence / absence of accretion disks , or the magnitude of accretion rate apparent from our data , particularly given the plausibility of proposed x - ray production and absorption processes .",
    "perhaps the intrinsic range in x - ray emission properties is so large that trends are difficult to discern , even with samples as large as several hundred stars .",
    "alternatively , it may be that multiple mechanisms are at work simultaneously , and sorting among them may require a somewhat finer characterization of x - ray properties than lx  the single property thus far used in searching for accretion - related correlations .",
    "we anticipate that the coup data , in combination with the orion treasury program ( robberto et  al .",
    "2005 ) and the spitzer data in orion ( megeath et  al .",
    "2006 ) will provide considerably more insight into the physical processes accompanying disk accretion .",
    "in particular , the treasury program will provide robust estimates of ultraviolet excess emission for a large sample , which in combination with extant optical spectroscopic studies yielding @xmath81 and @xmath22  estimates , should provide accretion rate estimates for a large ( perhaps 1000 stars ) sample of accreting pms stars .",
    "the deep coup exposures of the onc ( 20 @xmath82 the length of the chandra observations reported here ) should provide well - characterized x - ray spectral energy distributions from 0.5 to 5 kev  _ sine qua non _ for sorting the relative contributions of soft x - ray emission that may arise from accretion , harder coronal x - ray emission and the effects of absorption arising in mass outflows .",
    "we have studied the x - ray properties of stars in the orion ff and ngc 2264 . with ages of @xmath01 myr and @xmath03 myr respectively , both regions contain stars that are older than most stars in the onc .",
    "rotation periods are available for a relatively large fraction of the pms population in these regions .",
    "furthermore , ngc 2264 contains a significant number of stars that have made the transition to radiative tracks .",
    "these samples thus enable study of evolution- and rotation - driven changes in x - ray properties over the age range 1 - 5 myr .    the data for the orion ff and ngc 2264 , when combined with the much more extensive data from the coup survey of the onc ,",
    "establish a number of clear patterns in the behavior of x - ray emission in pms stars .",
    "in all three regions , log @xmath1  for stars on convective tracks correlates positively with both log @xmath2and also with stellar mass , not surprisingly since log @xmath2  is strongly correlated with mass . as",
    "preibisch et  al .",
    "( 2005b ) point out , a strong correlation between x - ray emission and stellar properties argues that the x - ray emission probably originates primarily in compact ( coronal ? ) structures associated with the star .",
    "we confirm as well that the level of x - ray emission is directly related to stellar structure in that the level of emission drops on average by @xmath010 when pms stars with masses in the range @xmath0 1 - 2 m@xmath4  make the transition from fully convective to radiative tracks , where stars of about solar mass have radiative cores and convective envelopes .",
    "the fractional x - ray luminosity , log @xmath1/@xmath2 , is not strongly correlated with mass for stars on convective tracks ; the scatter in the relationships of both log @xmath1  and log @xmath1/@xmath2  with mass is large .",
    "the physical reasons for this large scatter remain unclear .",
    "age is apparently not a large contributor ; while there is evidence the onc has nearly twice as many stars with extremely high x - ray emission ( log @xmath1/@xmath2  @xmath83 ) as the orion ff and ngc 2264 , we see little change in _",
    "median _ values of either log @xmath1  or log @xmath1/@xmath2  during the first @xmath05 myr of evolution down convective tracks . in sharp contrast to main sequence stars",
    ", we find no correlation between log @xmath1  and log @xmath1/@xmath2  with @xmath55 or @xmath14  for stars on convective tracks , although more @xmath14  data are needed in ngc 2264 .",
    "preibisch et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) have argued that x - ray variability at typical levels is likely to be too small to account for the scatter in @xmath1/@xmath2 .    in both the orion ff and ngc 2264 we find , in agreement with earlier studies of the onc , that stars with larger values of log @xmath1/@xmath2  are more likely to exhibit spot - modulated periods .",
    "approximately @xmath84 of the stars with log @xmath1/@xmath2@xmath85 are periodic , while while only about @xmath86 of the stars with log @xmath1/@xmath2@xmath87 have periods , and this difference does not appear to be the result of any biases in the samples .",
    "it may well be that , as stassun et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) have suggested , more active stars have larger and/or more organized magnetic spot coverage and that periodic variations are more easily measured in such circumstances .",
    "we have searched for a correlation between log @xmath1  and log @xmath1/@xmath2   and 1 ) near - ir excess , which is a circumstellar disk indicator ; 2 ) uv excess and h@xmath40 , both of which are indicators of accretion ; and 3 ) the mass accretion rate , as inferred from the uv excess .",
    "there is substantial scatter in all of these relationships , and no clear trends emerge .",
    "discovery of the relationship , if any , between accretion and x - ray emission awaits the combination of coup results , which provides measures of x - ray luminosity and x - ray spectral energy distributions , with the corresponding results from the ongoing hst orion treasury program , which promises to provide accurate estimates of accretion rates for large samples of pms stars , and the spitzer data in orion , which will provide more accurate mid - ir disk indicators .",
