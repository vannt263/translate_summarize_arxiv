    "but the pullback with respect to the diagonal map induces on cohomology precisely the cup product @xmath107 .",

    ". then the two bicomplexes have isomorphic spectral sequences ( starting with the @xmath5 term ) associated with the vertical filtration , as follows from the standard definitions , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "we can take @xmath129 with the zero differential if the space @xmath1 is @xmath0-formal , i.e. if @xmath130 and the cochain algebra @xmath131 may be connected with @xmath130 by a chain of dg algebra quasi - isomorphisms .",
    "when @xmath0 is the field @xmath132 of rational numbers , we can take the complex of sullivan cochains , and for the field @xmath133 of real numbers we can take the de rham complex of differential forms . finally by a result of @xcite , for @xmath0 a field of finite characteristic @xmath134 , the dg algebra @xmath9 exists if @xmath1 is @xmath135-connected and @xmath136    when the algebra @xmath8 is not flat over @xmath0 , a better version of its graph homology is obtained by taking a flat @xmath137-resolution @xmath138 and then computing the cohomology of @xmath74 with respect to the total differential .",
    "ideally , one should be able to work with the graph homology of @xmath131 itself .",
    "although this dg algebra is definitely not graded commutative , its deviation from commutativity can be measured by using the @xmath139-operations of steenrod , which were generalized by mcclure and smith in @xcite to certain _  sequence operations \" _ on @xmath131 .",

    "the cocycles , of @xmath170 , we have the standard exact sequences : @xmath174 since we assumed @xmath175 and @xmath176 to be projective , this gives for any @xmath0-module @xmath1 the isomorphisms for @xmath177 and all @xmath64 : @xmath178 since we assumed @xmath0 to be of finite @xmath10-dimension , by induction on @xmath179 we get that @xmath180 which must be zero if @xmath179 is large enough .",

    "we recall this construction from the perturbation theory viewpoint .",
    "first consider @xmath9 and @xmath8 as non - unital algebras with the zero product and consider their bar constructions @xmath238 , and similarly for @xmath239 .",

    "as in the previous subsection , any reduction @xmath165 of @xmath9 to @xmath8 induces a reduction of the graph cohomology complex @xmath263 onto @xmath65 . we will show that the operators @xmath143 defined by ( [ dee ] ) are completely determined by the @xmath75-structure on @xmath8 , induced by @xmath165 . in view of proposition [ standard ] , this gives information about the higher differentials of the spectral sequence .",
