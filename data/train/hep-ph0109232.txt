    "the flavour - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath12-decays , involving the @xmath13-quark transition @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) provide a crucial testing grounds for the standard model at the quantum level , since such transitions are forbidden in the born approximation .",
    "hence , these rare @xmath12-decays are characterized by their high sensitivity to new physics .    in the standard model , the short distance contribution to",
    "rare b - decays is dominated by the top quark , and long distance contributions by form factors .",
    "precise measurements of these transition will not only provide a good estimate of the top quark mass and the ckm matrix elements @xmath17 , but also of the hadronic properties of @xmath12-mesons , namely form factors which in turn would provide a good knowledge of the corresponding dynamics and more hint for the non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "the experimental searches for the fcnc b - decays have already provided first evidents .",
    "the recent experimental observations of the rare decay mode @xmath18 have been determined by cleo @xcite , and more recently also by babar @xcite and belle @xcite    @xmath19    and @xmath20    and also of the inclusive rate @xcite : @xmath21    however , the first observation of the rare @xmath12-decay to the orbitally excited strange mesons has been reported only by cleo @xcite . with an integrated luminosity of @xmath22 of @xmath23 data corresponding to @xmath24 @xmath25 mesons pairs",
    ", they measure the @xmath26 decay with a branching fraction of @xmath27    these important experimental measurements provides a crucial challenge to the theory .",
    "many theoretical approaches have been employed to predict the exclusive @xmath9 decay rate ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand",
    "less attention has been devoted to rare radiative @xmath12-decays to excited strange mesons @xcite .",
    "most of these theoretical approaches rely on non - relativistic quark models@xcite , hqet @xcite and relativistic model@xcite .",
    "however there is a large spread between different results , due to a different treatment of the long distance effects .",
    "the aim of this paper is to estimate the contribution of higher @xmath0-resonances to the radiative rare decays @xmath28 . while the effective hamiltonian approach allows to include short distances qcd corrections at scales @xmath29 , estimates of the hadronic matrix elements of the relevant operators",
    "necessarily require some non - perturbative technique .",
    "we use here qcd sum rule @xcite , which has been proved to be a powerful tool for such purposes .    in this paper , we use an elaborate version of the qcd sum rule , known as qcd sum rule on the light cone which has been developed originally for light quark systems in @xcite .",
    "this method was demonstrated to be very suitable for exclusive process .",
    "moreover , it is technically much simpler than the standard qcd sum rule approach , where the basic correlator between the vacuum and a light meson state is expressed by universal quantities called light - cone wave functions for that particular light meson .",
    "these wave functions represent distributions of the light - cone momentum of the constituents , and can be classified by their twist defined as the difference between the canonical dimension and the lorentz spin of the corresponding operator .",
    "their asymptotic form is fixed by perturbative qcd , while the non - asymptotic effects at lower momentum scales can be estimated from qcd sum rules for two point correlators of appropriate currents @xcite .",
    "the principal theoretical result of this paper is a sum rule for the electromagnetic penguin form factor appearing in the decays @xmath30 , where  @xmath3 can be pseudoscalar , vector , scalar , axial - vector , tensor or pseudo - tensor .",
    "we derive the corresponding sum rule .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we review the effective hamiltonian for radiative @xmath12-decays , dominated by the electromagnetic penguins . in section 3",
    ", we define the form factors , which govern the exclusive rare @xmath12-decays to orbitally excited @xmath3-mesons . in section 4 , we describe the method of the qcd sum rules on the light cone and derive our general sum rule for the form factors of the electromagnetic penguin operators entering in the decays @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand respectively for vector ( axial - vector ) and tensor ( pseudo - tensor ) @xmath3-meson .",
    "the wave functions and the decay constants which are needed to evaluate the sum rule are discussed in section 5 , and the numerical estimates of the form factors and the predicted branching fractions of @xmath30 are presented in section 6 .",
    "finally , section 7 contains a summary and some concluding remarks .",
    "at the quark level , the rare semileptonic decay @xmath35 can be described in terms of the effective hamiltonian obtained by integrating out the top quark and @xmath36 bosons : @xmath37    where @xmath38 are the corresponding ckm matrix elements and @xmath39 is the fermi coupling constant .",
    "the operator basis is defined as follows @xcite : @xmath40    where @xmath41 , @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 is the four - momenta transfer of the photon .",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 are the generators of qcd , and @xmath46 are @xmath47 color indices . here",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the electromagnetic and chromomagnetic field strength tensor , respectively .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath50 are evaluated perturbatively at the @xmath51 scale and then evaluated down to the renormalization scale @xmath52 by the renormalisation group equation .",
    "actually , they are known at the next - to - leading order @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this section is to write the specific matrix elements for @xmath53 transitions , where @xmath3 denotes the higher @xmath0-resonances summarized in table [ k^ * * ] . at the tree level only the magnetic moment operator",
    "@xmath54 contributes to the transition amplitudes .",
    "thus , we are interested only in the following matrix elements    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are respectively the tensor and pseudo - tensor currents . for a generic radiative decay @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 stands for pseudoscalar , vector , scalar , axial - vector , tensor and pseudo - tensor respectively",
    ", one defines a transition form factor @xmath61 as : @xmath62    where @xmath63 , and :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are respectively the generic mass of the @xmath3-meson , the polarization of the vector ( axial - vector ) and the tensor ( pseudo - tensor ) final meson .    with the above definition , the exclusive decay widths are given by : @xmath68    with @xmath69 .",
    "a good quantity to test the model dependence of the form factors for the exclusive decay is the ratio of the exclusive - to - inclusive radiative decay branching ratio @xcite : @xmath70    where @xmath71 . with this normalization ,",
    "one eliminates the uncertainties from the ckm factor @xmath72 and the short distance wilson coefficient @xmath73 .",
    "thus , we are left in eqs.([eqrv ] ) and ( [ eqrt ] ) with unknown form factors @xmath74 , which we will derive in the next section .",
    "._spectrum of excited neutral @xmath0-meson taken from @xcite , except for the quantities in brackets .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 represent respectively the radial excitation , the orbital angular momentum , the sum of the two quark spins in the meson and the total meson spin .",
    "the parity is defined as @xmath79 . _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "motivated by the first observation of the radiative decay @xmath80 , we have investigated rare radiative @xmath12 decays to orbitally excited @xmath3-mesons .",
    "first , we have presented an alternative method of calculating the transition form factors and related decays using the qcd sum rules on the light - cone .",
    "we restricted our calculations to the leading twist-2 operator for the @xmath2 , as in @xcite , and to the asymptotic wave function for the other @xmath3-mesons .",
    "the latter choice is simply based on the fact that using qcd sum rules , it is impossible to get rid of the lower - lying states contributions from these higher resonances .    however , nothing is known about the corresponding @xmath3-decay constants , and one has to predict them . for that",
    ", we have used recent data @xcite on semileptonic @xmath81 decays to obtain them . for @xmath82 ,",
    "we have constrained the corresponding decay constant with the recent data @xcite on @xmath83 .",
    "we find that if @xmath84 , a substantial fraction @xmath85 of the inclusive @xmath86 branching ratio goes into the @xmath82 channel , in a good agreement with recent cleo data @xcite .",
    "our prediction for the @xmath87 branching fraction yields to @xmath88 , also in good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "as far as decays into higher @xmath0-resonances are concerned , our results are in general in much better agreement with @xcite than @xcite and @xcite , apart from the @xmath89-channel where the difference is more significant . for the @xmath90-meson ,",
    "we have plotted @xmath91 as function of the corresponding decay constant .",
    "finally , it should be noticed that the theoretical uncertainties in our light - cone sum rules are the wave functions and the decay constants of the @xmath3-mesons .",
    "the accuracy of our calculation can be substantially improved by taking into account the wave functions of twist-3 and twist-4 for the @xmath87 decay , and going beyond the asymptotic form for the other decay modes . to reduce the uncertainties on the @xmath3-mesons decay constants",
    ", one can determine them independently using qcd sum rules for the two - point correlator of the corresponding currents .",
