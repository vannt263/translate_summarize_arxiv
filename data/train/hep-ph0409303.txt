    "heavy - flavor production has always been an important testing ground for quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , one of the reasons being that it addresses the problem of where to draw the dividing line between perturbative and non - perturbative aspects .",
    "the photoproduction of open charm is particularly interesting because it also allows valuable insights into the partonic structure of the photon .",
    "results on inclusive @xmath0 photoproduction from the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations at the desy @xmath4 collider hera have been compared to leading - order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations @xcite .",

    "several approaches have been followed in the literature .",
    "the qcd - improved parton model implemented in the modified minimal - subtraction ( @xmath5 ) renormalization and factorization scheme and endowed with non - perturbative fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , which proved itself so convincingly for light - hadron inclusive production @xcite , also provides an ideal theoretical framework for a coherent global analysis of @xmath6- @xcite and @xmath7-meson data @xcite , provided that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the energy scale characteristic for the respective production process and @xmath10 .",

    "the criterion @xmath8 is certainly satisfied for @xmath1 annihilation on the @xmath17-boson resonance , and for the photo- , lepto- , and hadroproduction of @xmath6 and @xmath7 hadrons with transverse momenta @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , the universality of the ffs is guaranteed by the factorization theorem @xcite , which entitles us to transfer information on how charm and bottom quarks hadronize to @xmath6 and @xmath7 hadrons , respectively , in a well - defined quantitative way from @xmath1 annihilation , where the measurements are usually most precise , to other kinds of experiments , such as photo- , lepto- , and hadroproduction . in refs .",

    "we emphasize that the value of @xmath24 carries no meaning by itself , but it depends on the underlying theory for the description of the fragmentation process , in particular , on the choice of the starting scale @xmath29 , on whether the analysis is performed in lo or nlo , and on how the final - state collinear singularities are factorized in nlo .",
    "an alternative to the zmvfns with purely non - perturbative ffs is to decompose the ffs into a perturbative component , the so - called _ perturbative ffs _ ( pffs ) @xcite , and a non - perturbative component @xcite .    in the traditional _ massive - quark scheme",

    "there are no collinear singularities associated with the outgoing @xmath16-quark lines that need to be subtracted and absorbed into ffs .",
    "this scheme breaks down for @xmath18 because of would - be collinear singularities of the form @xmath30 , which are not resummed .",

    "is provided by the _ general - mass variable - flavour - number scheme _ ( gmvfns ) @xcite . in a nutshell ,",
    "this procedure consists in explicitly performing the @xmath33 limit of the ffns result , comparing the outcome , term by term , with the zmvfns result in the @xmath5 scheme , and subtracting the difference terms from the ffns result .",
    "owing to the factorization theorem @xcite , the hard - scattering cross sections thus obtained can then be convoluted with non - perturbative @xmath6- and @xmath7-hadron ffs extracted from lep1 data using the pure @xmath5 scheme @xcite .",

    "using the massless scheme , we can rely on the factorization theorem and write the photoproduction cross section for @xmath44 as a convolution of the partonic cross section @xmath45 with the pdfs of the incident particles and the ffs for an outgoing parton fragmenting into a @xmath0 meson . in this approach ,",

    "the partons are massless , this leads to soft and collinear singularities .",
    "the soft singularities cancel between the real and the virtual corrections , while the collinear ones are absorbed into the pdfs or ffs .",
    "for example , the collinear singularities appearing at nlo if the incident photon splits into a collinear @xmath59 pair are absorbed into the pdf @xmath60 at the factorization scale @xmath47 .",
    "thus the direct- and resolved - photon contributions separately exhibit strong dependences on @xmath47 , which cancel out only in their sum , up to terms which are formally beyond nlo .",

    "<S> we study the photoproduction of a @xmath0 meson in association with a hadron jet at next - to - leading order in the parton model of qcd with non - perturbative fragmentation functions extracted from lep1 data of @xmath1 annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse - momentum and rapidity distributions recently measured at desy hera in various kinematic ranges nicely agree with our theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a useful test of the universality and the scaling violations of the fragmentation functions predicted by the factorization theorem . </S>",
    "<S> these comparisons also illustrate the significance of the charm component in the resolved photon . </S>",
    "<S> this is elaborated by investigating the cross - section distributions in @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>"
