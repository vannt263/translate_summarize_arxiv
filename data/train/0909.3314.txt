    "the two - color diagram ( 2cd ) of stellar dust / gas envelope sources in the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) point source catalog ( psc ) has been very useful in characterizing the circumstellar environment of late - type stars , typically thought to be at the top of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) @xcite .",
    "the iras 60@xmath0m/25@xmath0 m versus 25@xmath0m/12@xmath0 m two - color diagram statistically distinguishes between carbon - rich and oxygen - rich objects . in the latter color",
    "it also indicates the thickness of the circumstellar shell based on the appearance of the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate feature in the individual 7.7 to 22.6 @xmath0 m low - resolution spectra ( lrs ) @xcite .    for many studies since the iras mission",
    ", the iras 2cd has thus been the starting point for color - selection of samples ; not only to select agb or red giant branch ( rgb ) stars , but also to select e.g.  proto - planetary nebulae , young stellar objects and starburst galaxies . the iras 2cd has been revolutionary in the study of the late evolutionary stages of evolved stars and chemical enrichment of the galaxy due to the enhanced mass - loss of these stars .",
    "moreover , the 2cd selection is very effective in finding circumstellar masers , and hence line - of - sight velocities of stars that then can be used for kinematic studies of the galaxy .",
    "for example , objects in iras color region iiib and iv @xcite have been targeted for 1612 mhz oh maser emission , whereas objects in region ii usually have a circumstellar envelope ( cse ) too thin to form and sustain these oh masers . on the other hand , objects in region",
    "ii may be cses in which sio maser emission is more likely to exist ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and the extensive list of references therein ) .",
    "the iras all - sky survey has a significant shortcoming in the sense that due to the low angular resolution , the galactic plane ( and in particular the bulge ) survey region suffers from confusion .",
    "this is unfortunate as the majority of evolved stars ( but also e.g.  young stellar objects ) , are found in the plane .",
    "therefore subsequent infrared surveys using the infrared space observatory ( iso , with the isogal survey ) , the midcourse space experiment ( msx , with the galactic plane survey ) , and the spitzer space telescope ( with the glimpse and mipsgal surveys ) have concentrated on the galactic plane and bulge with much better angular resolution @xcite . however , in correcting for iras shortcoming , areas of the sky which overlap with the non - confused iras observations are minimal .",
    "also , these other surveys have typically used other infrared wavebands and filters than iras . when the sources of interest are the intrinsically variable late - type stars , a direct comparison of colors between iras and e.g.  msx is , in principle , very difficult if not impossible .",
    "nevertheless , with the assumption that colors do not differ too much between observing epochs , i.e.  stellar phase , and thus that results of a comparison between subsamples in a _ statistical _ sense can be interpreted , an attempt at a comparison between iras colors and other infrared colors can be made . because the psc of mipsgal and akari were not available in the summer of 2008 ( when we began this study ) , and because isogal and glimpse were limited in spatial coverage and wavelength range respectively , we here present a comparison of iras and msx colors .",
    "this comparison provides a tool to study , in the first instance , oxygen - rich agb and rgb stars in msx colors , similar to the iras 2cd .",
    "we note that the iras 2cd can not fundamentally be replicated in msx colors , because the msx data do not extend to a long enough wavelength so that the vertical axis of the iras 2cd can be approximated with msx data .",
    "most of the analysis and discussion that follows concentrates on the horizontal extent of the iras 2cd .    as an example of the capability of this comparison",
    ", we apply our msx color tool to investigate the occurrence of 86 ghz sio masers in color - selected sources in the galactic bulge .",
    "it is our intention to derive similar comparisons for spitzer ( combined glimpse and mipsgal ) and akari colors once their point source catalogs are public , and to investigate the occurrence of other cse masers as a function of color in a similar way using these new tools .",
    "section  [ select ] describes the selection of the data sets ; the sources that are in both the iras and msx pscs but excluding sources that could confuse or contaminate a statistical analysis .",
    "as most masers originate from oxygen - bearing molecules , we would like to be able to separate the carbon - rich from the oxygen - rich cses based purely on msx colors .",
    "but before investigating such a separation in sect .",
    "[ iras2msx ] , we compare the `` evolutionary curve '' of oxygen - rich stars with circumstellar material in the iras 2cd as described by @xcite with msx colors .",
    "note that this `` evolutionary curve '' is more a circumstellar envelope opacity measure than a strict stellar mass - loss evolution curve .",
    "therefore we will refer to this curve as the `` cse - sequence '' for oxygen - rich late - type stars in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the resulting msx 2cds are discussed in sect .",
    "[ msx2cd ] and an example of their scientific usefulness is shown in sect .",
    "[ sio86 ] .",
    "future plans are collected in sect .",
    "[ plans ] before closing with a summary .",
    "for the cross - identification between iras and msx sources we used the positions from version 2.0 of the iras psc ( 245889 sources ) and faint source catalog ( fsc ; 173044 sources ) and version 2.3 from the msx(6c ) psc ( 440487 sources ) @xcite .    because we were very wary of contamination with incorrect cross - identifications , but on the other hand needed a data set of cross - identification as large as possible , we compromised between mission position accuracy and search radius .",
    "that is , iras psc 12 @xmath0 m positions typically are accurate to @xmath1 79 , within a beam ( angular resolution ) of @xmath1 1@xmath25 , and msx psc 8.28 @xmath0 m positions typically are accurate to @xmath1 2 , within a beam of @xmath1 18  @xcite .",
    "we therefore used a search radius of 10 ; the arithmetic mean of the beam and accuracy of the msx mission , which is the more restrictive between iras and msx .",
    "we used the same 10  to cross - identify the msx psc with the iras fsc for two reasons .",
    "first , this expands the data set with more sources to compare iras and msx colors .",
    "second , it also reveals those iras - msx psc cross - identifications that could be confused with faint iras sources .",
    "our data set thus excludes the msx sources that had more than one possible iras counterpart within 10 , whether or not from the iras psc or fsc , but also includes the ( single ) fainter iras counterparts .",
    "in total we found 45895 msx sources identified with single iras psc sources and 620 identified with single iras fsc sources ( 46515 total ) .",
    "multiple identifications within 10  were found for 482 msx sources , whereas 393490 msx sources had no counterpart in the iras psc nor in the iras fsc within 10  radius .",
    "two msx sources were removed because they could be ( at 6.64  or 5.54 ) identified with the same fsc source .",
    "similarly , we removed another 76 msx sources for which the identification with a unique iras psc source within 10  was ambiguous . to be consistent with the multiple identifications above ,",
    "this means removing the msx source even in the case where one possible identification was within 3  ( 2.87 ) and the other was as far as ( almost ) 10  ( 9.60 ) away . from this sub - total of 46437 sources which match in position , we removed 26743 cross - identifications for which the msx sources had fewer than two reliable flux densities ( i.e. , `` quality numbers '' for the photometry which were not 3 or 4 ) , i.e. , for which not a single reliable , good quality msx color could be calculated .",
    "another 16194 iras sources were removed for which any of the 12 , 25 or 60 @xmath0 m fluxes were unreliable ( quality not 3 ) as in that case we could not place them in the iras 2cd diagram reliably .",
    "finally , another 957 sources were removed as they fall outside the traditional @xcite iras 2cd color magnitude range limits ( their fig .  5a , 5b : @xmath3-[25 ] }",
    "< 2 $ ] and @xmath4-[60 ] } < 1 $ ] ; see next subsection ) .",
    "the remaining catalog of good quality iras sources in the traditional @xcite iras 2cd with a likely unique msx counterpart within 10  radius for which at least one good quality msx color could be derived is 2543 .",
    "only two sources are from the fsc",
    ". figure  [ f1 ] shows the histogram of the difference in position between the final 2543 iras and msx associations . from the peaked distribution around 2.5",
    "( with @xmath1 18  angular resolution ) we conclude that the associations are very likely proper cross - identifications . the location of these remaining cross - identified iras / msx sources in the iras 2cd diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] .      to be consistent with the original iras 2cd nomenclature",
    "we follow the ( uncorrected ) _ color magnitude _ definition used by @xcite ,",
    "i.e.  color magnitude @xmath5 - [ \\beta ] = -2.5 \\times { \\log}_{10 } ( { \\rm f}_{\\alpha}/{\\rm f}_{\\beta}$ ] ) where @xmath6 is the measured flux density in jansky ( jy ) at waveband @xmath7 taken from the iras psc / fsc version 2.0 or from the msx psc version 2.3 @xcite . for iras wavebands we will use the numbers 12 , 25 and 60 to designate the waveband ; the center wavelength in @xmath0 m of the filter passband . for msx we will use the capital letters a , c , d and e for the wavebands centered at 8.28 , 12.13 , 14.65 and 21.3 @xmath0 m respectively .",
    "if we call a source `` blue '' or `` bluer '' we refer to the smaller or more negative value(s ) of a color ; relatively larger or more positive color values are `` red '' or `` redder '' . we also use the iras _ color regions _ determined by @xcite .",
    "that is , statistically , the oxygen - rich stars are located in the iras color regions identified with capital roman numerals i , ii , iiia , iiib , iv and v along the cse - sequence , and carbon - rich stars typically are located in the iras color regions via , vib and vii ( fig .",
    "color region viii contains a complex mixture of sources . for the remainder of this paper we will concentrate on the oxygen - rich cse - sequence i  v , completely ignore the 88 sources in color region viii , and only occasionally comment on the carbon - rich sources in color regions via , vib and vii .",
    "later we will also introduce msx color regions with non - capitalized roman numerals ( _ i _ , _ ii _ , _ iiia _ , _ iiib _ , _ iv _ and _ v _ ) ( to keep them recognizable as distinct msx , rather than iras color regions ) , but where the same type of sources can be found in the different 2cds ( sect .",
    "[ msx2cd ] ) .    in our analysis",
    "we have chosen not to apply any zero - magnitude or color corrections .",
    "one of the strengths of the iras 2cd as defined by @xcite is that it also did not have any of these corrections applied .",
    "the analysis of @xcite was therefore independent of different choices of extinction curves and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of individual objects . only in sect .",
    "[ coline ] we will temporarily divert and apply a zero - magnitude correction  a simple axis shift  to compare our data with other data sets . the zero - magnitude correction is applied by , e.g. , adding @xmath8 to the uncorrected [ a]@xmath9[d ] color and @xmath10 to the uncorrected [ d]@xmath9[e ] color , where 58.49 , 26.51 , 18.29 and 8.80 jy are the zero - magnitude flux densities for the msx bands a , c , d and e , respectively .    finally , although we made an effort to exclude data that is `` confused '' ( i.e. , where the iras beam would include emission from several objects as compared to emission from a single object in the smaller msx beam ) , it is quite possible that a few sources are confused or mis - identified .",
    "however , from the tail of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we estimate the number of mis - identifications or confused sources is less than 10% .",
    "since we are making a statistical comparison of the colors , we expect no major difference in our conclusions when a few misidentified objects remain in the sample",

    "the cse - sequence of oxygen - rich objects in the iras 2cd ( see fig .  [ f2 ] ) is an exponential function of the iras [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] color resulting in an iras [ 25]@xmath9[60 ] color . with respect to the [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] color region domain",
    "the cse - sequence overlaps in regions iiib and iv ( between @xmath11-[25 ] } < 1.0 $ ] ) and in regions iv and v ( between @xmath12-[25 ] } < 1.4 $ ] ) .",
    "however , this overlap is much less than in the [ 25]@xmath9[60 ] color region domain , where regions i  iiib overlap between @xmath13-[60 ] } < -1.6 $ ] .",
    "it is therefore convenient to regard the cse - sequence in terms of iras [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] color .",
    "using the [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] colors at this stage does not distinguish between carbon - rich objects in regions via , vib and vii and oxygen - rich objects along the cse - sequence for [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] @xmath14 0.4 ; we will discuss this further in sect .",
    "[ coline ] .",
    "strictly speaking , in terms of the center wavelength of the wavebands , the iras [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] color would correspond roughly to the msx [ c]@xmath9[e ] color , with no corresponding color in the spitzer ( glimpse+mips ) nor in the isogal surveys .",
    "however , as readily explained in @xcite , the msx a filter covers the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate feature , whereas the 11.3 @xmath0 m sic feature would appear in the msx c filter ; the iras 12 @xmath0 m band filter includes both featuresm filter excludes both , which could complicate recognizing the cse - sequence using irac data . ] .",
    "as the silicate feature is typically the most prominent in the iras lrs , the iras [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] color may also , or better , correspond to the msx [ a]@xmath9[e ] color .",
    "figures  [ f3 ]  &  [ f4 ] and table  [ t1 ] compare the iras colors to the msx colors that could be derived from the cross - identifications .",
    "this comparison shows that the iras [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] color can generally be converted to msx colors , most notably in the msx [ a]@xmath9[e ] and [ c]@xmath9[e ] colors , but also with a reasonable color range in the msx [ a]@xmath9[d ] color ( table  [ t2 ] ) .",
    "we note that there is no dependence on total flux density at any waveband ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) . except for the [ c]@xmath9[e ] color ,",
    "the dispersion and deviation from the trend is in general larger for very red sources , where [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] @xmath15 1 , but overall the agreement is well within a third of a magnitude .",
    "we note that most of these sources are intrinsically variable evolved stars for which a difference in color due to non - simultaneous observations within a mission , or observing different stellar phases between the iras and msx missions is reflected in this dispersion @xcite .",
    "no conversion can be made for the iras [ 25]@xmath9[60 ] color .",
    "this is not surprising as all msx colors are determined for the sed shortward of 25 @xmath0 m , and are largely insensitive to the sed and iras color longward of 25 @xmath0 m wavelength .    for the oxygen - rich sources along the cse - sequence , this close correspondence to the iras",
    "[ 12]@xmath9[25 ] color to three msx colors is fortunate , as the cse - sequence thus can be represented by the iras [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] color , and also by the msx [ a]@xmath9[e ] , [ c]@xmath9[e ] and [ a]@xmath9[d ] colors .",
    "we will thus assume that the small inaccuracies of converting iras colors using the linear relations in table  [ t1 ] remain within the noise of the whole sample of derived msx colors .",
    "then the iras cse - sequence can be described as msx cse - sequences by substituting the iras [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] color with two different msx colors in eq .  2 of @xcite for the range of valid iras [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] colors ( @xmath91.5 @xmath14 [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] @xmath14 @xmath161.3 ) .",
    "it follows that the iras [ 25]@xmath9[60 ] color can be eliminated by equating the right hand sides of the two equations obtained above .",
    "rearrangement of the resulting equation yields the msx cse - sequences given in table  [ t3 ] ( sect .  [ msxcse ] ) .",
    ".least square fits of iras / msx color differences [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have investigated whether our analysis also suffers from possible inaccuracies or effects in the weaker 8.28 @xmath0 m objects . fortunately the cross - identified objects , that are also detected by the less sensitive iras 12 @xmath0 m detector , belong to the brighter msx sample for which almost no sources are expected to be affected .",
    "this can also been seen from the lack of color - coded source symbols shifted to the right of the main distribution in the [ a]@xmath9[e ] versus [ a]@xmath9[d ] diagram .",
    "note that the black dots of msx color region _ v _ ( or iras color region v , i.e. , mostly planetary nebula ) are shifted redward , because they are intrinsically redder than the cse - sequence sources .",
    "previously the iras 2cd has been very successful in selecting objects to target : for example , for 1612 mhz maser emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , iras colors have been used to select targets for 86 ghz ( @xmath17 ) and 43 ghz ( @xmath18 ) sio masers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have made a careful analysis of the 43 ghz sio maser detection rate as function of iras color and iras color region from the data collected by @xcite in the galactic bulge and disk .",
    "the izumiura data were selected based on color _ and _ variability index with likely carbon - rich stars from iras regions via , vib and vii removed .",
    "in addition to an overall constant detection rate of sio masers of about 61@xmath193% as function of [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] color , @xcite suggest that the detection rate in the galactic bulge is higher than in the disk .",
    "since in both the galactic bulge and disk the iras survey suffered from confusion , the @xcite study may have suffered from selection effects .",
    "it will be interesting to repeat this analysis based on msx colors alone .",
    "another approach was used by @xcite who bypassed the iras color selection and used the combined isogal - denis data to empirically determine a complicated , extinction - corrected , color - magnitude - based selection from msx [ a]@xmath9[d ] color and also on the msx variability index in the galactic bulge region . a cross - identification of @xcite s target sources with the iras psc ( 10  radius as in sect .",
    "[ select ] ) results in only three sources with good photometry in all three iras bands , and only 81 with good photometry in [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] color . a selection based on iras color in this case",
    "would not have yielded an interesting sample , whereas the simple msx tool presented here would have been extremely helpful in ease of use compared to their selection .    to assess their selection in terms of the [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] color analysis by @xcite , we plot the data from @xcite in the msx 2cds in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] and ( non)-detection histograms in fig .  [ f11 ] .",
    "most sources selected by @xcite are located in msx region _",
    "iiia _ which was the iras region they were targeting .",
    "their sample likely includes more carbon - rich sources than the sample of @xcite as @xcite could not remove those sources using the iras [ 25]@xmath9[60 ] color .",
    "the @xcite 86 ghz sio maser detection rate is consistent with an overall constant 65 - 66% as a function of either [ a]@xmath9[d ] , [ a]@xmath9[e ] or [ c]@xmath9[e ] color , i.e. , with ( unavailable ) [ 12]@xmath9[25 ] color ( fig .",
    "[ f11 ] ) .",
    "remarkably , this is the same result as @xcite for the 43 ghz masers . for msx region _",
    "iiia _ , where the majority of the @xcite sample lies , the iras / msx cross - identified sample ( sect .",
    "[ select ] ) indicates that the carbon - star contamination is about 2339% .",
    "therefore , when selecting msx",
    "_ iiia _ sources , using [ a]@xmath9[d ] colors ( similar to the messineo sample ) ,",
    "we find 61% to be in the oxygen - rich region of the iras 2cd ( see table  [ t4 ] ) .",
    "assuming that carbon - rich sources have all their oxygen locked up in carbon - monoxide molecules and thus never harbor sio masers , this suggests that 1 ) almost all oxygen - rich sources selected using _ iiia _ would show detectable 86 ghz sio maser emission , and 2 ) the complicated selection on [ a]@xmath9[d ] color by @xcite , which includes flux and variability information , was likely not much better than simply selecting on msx color as they both yield very similar detection rates .",
    "as individual histogram bins at the blue ( or red ) end of the histograms in fig .",
    "[ f11 ] typically indicate an 80% ( or 50% ) detection rate , there may be a small trend of decreasing sio maser detection rate for redder sources . however , the range in msx color is too small , and the uncertainties too large , to make a definite statement about this .    when compared to the msx psc 2.3 , @xcite s list of targets resulted in 204 cross - identifications among the 271 sio maser detections and 109 cross - identifications among the 173 targets without detected sio maser emission",
    ". the targets without cross - identifications must be targets that could only be selected using the more sensitive isogal data  thus a sample of generally weaker infrared sources .",
    "as relatively more sio maser detections are found in the brighter infrared msx selection this probably confirms that brighter infrared sources are more likely to show detectable sio maser emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a more careful study can be done with a larger sample , using a larger color range .",
    "here we have shown how such a sample selected on msx colors ( which are directly related to iras colors in the @xcite 2cd ) can be obtained quite easily compared to previous selections in areas where iras was confused .",
    "it should not be too difficult to find possible applications for this new tool .",
    "almost any project using iras color region selection toward cses in regions on the sky where msx data is superior to iras data can make use of this new tool .",
    "moreover , particularly in the galactic plane , new bulge and center projects can be attempted that were previously impossible because of the confusion in the iras data .",
    "for example , one should be able to find a population of ( proto-)planetary nebulae hidden deeply in the nucleus of the galaxy and study how their cses are affected by the more hostile local environment .",
    "another example would be to select thousands of targets to survey for sio maser emission in the galactic plane .",
    "such a survey would e.g.  yield a map of galactic rotation based on a few thousand point masses ; gas is much more susceptible to non - gravitational forces .",
    "stars and cses in regions too crowded for iras can be much better classified using msx colors in terms of iras colors , etc .",
    "we leave it to the readers to find further applications in their own areas of expertise .    a straightforward future plan would be to compare and derive similar tools using the all - sky akari mission survey ( formerly astro - f ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with respect to the all - sky iras survey , but at much higher angular resolution .",
    "the akari psc is expected to become available sometime after the summer of 2009 .",
    "we have already commented on extending this study to the combined glimpse and mipsgal data .",
    "we have begun to cross - identify the glimpse and msx pscs , but the mipsgal ( 24 @xmath0 m ) psc needed to obtain spitzer data longward of 8 @xmath0 m has been unfortunately delayed beyond the original release date .",
    "using cross - identifications between the iras and msx source catalogs we have derived color ranges and color regions in msx 2cds that correspond to color regions along the `` evolutionary track '' or the cse - sequence in the iras 2cd .",
    "oxygen - rich objects in msx color regions _ i _ , _ ii _ , _ iiia _ , _ iiib _ , _ iv _ and _ v _ can be expected to have similar cses and cse properties as oxygen - rich objects in iras color regions i , ii , iiia , iiib , iv and v , respectively",
    ". this tool should be useful in selecting sources with different cses , especially in regions where selection using iras data is unsatisfactory such as the ( iras ) confused galactic bulge and plane regions .",
    "however , it is impossible to distinguish between carbon - rich and oxygen - rich sources based on msx colors alone ; e.g.  iras or near - infrared k and/or l band data is needed for that .",
    "this means that when only considering msx colors , carbon - rich objects and oxygen - rich objects populate the same msx regions , in particular _ i _ ,",
    "_ ii _ and _ iiia_. selecting sources with a negative oc - index will increase the fraction of carbon - rich objects , but also deselect the low ( t @xmath14 400 k ) temperature carbon - rich objects .",
    "the reverse selection is not likely : that one increases the fraction of oxygen - rich objects in a sample by selecting sources with positive oc - index , unless only cool sources are considered .",
    "we also seem to have revealed an error in the photometry of the msx e filter band .",
    "the flux density seems a factor @xmath1 2 too high , or @xmath1 0.51 magnitude too bright in [ e ] , for weak a filter band sources in the msx point source catalog version 2.3 .",
