    "+ in this article , we propose to compute this threshold for a one - parameter family of hamiltonians with three degrees of freedom and for a specific frequency vector , by two techniques  : by frequency map analysis and by renormalization .",

    "the result is that the values of the critical coupling given by the renormalization coincide up to numerical precision with the thresholds of the break - up of the spiral mean torus ( of dimension 3 ) given by frequency map analysis .",
    "the two methods we compare are completely independent , both conceptually and in their practical realizations .",
    "the frequency map analysis is based on the analysis of trajectories , while the renormalization is based on a criterion of convergence of a sequence of canonical transformations .",
    "+ we conjecture , on the basis of this numerical result , that the renormalization - group transformation converges up to the critical surface ( the set of hamiltonians where the torus of the given frequency is critical , i.e.  at the threshold of its break - up ) , at least in a region of the critical surface of the hamiltonian space where critical couplings are small enough ( in order that the elimination procedure is well - defined  @xcite ) .",

    "we analyze in this article the break - up of invariant tori with spiral mean frequencies for this particular type of models , by choosing a special form of the perturbation ( see section [ sect : result ] ) , such that the model is equivalent to a pendulum driven by two periodic forces with incommensurate frequencies .",
