    "when combined with the study of synchrotron fluctuations as suggested in @xcite , vca allows studies of the variation of turbulence properties from the cold to hot media .",

    "when density dispersion is smaller than the mean density ( which is so for the steep density ) , it is safe to assume density fluctuations as gaussian random field . however , if the density dispersion is larger than the mean density ( which can be so for the shallow spectra ) , gaussian distribution is not a good model for density field , as it violates an important constraint that @xmath49 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , for a shallow spectra , we take density fluctuations to obey log - normal distribution .",
    "this distribution is physically reasonable as it always satisfies the constraint @xmath49 , and is computationally convenient @xcite .",

    "velocity channel analysis ( see ) concerns with studies of the correlations of line intensities measured in velocity channels @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the central velocity ( frequency ) of the channel `` i '' , and @xmath52 is the channel profile of the width @xmath53 ( such as @xmath54 when @xmath55 ) .",
    "vca s focus is on intensity correlations between pairs of los as function of los separation and , importantly , as a function of velocity channel width .",
    "relevant statistical measures are the correlation function @xmath56 and the structure function @xmath57    there are two important regimes : _ thin _ velocity slice regime , where information about velocity spectra can be obtained , and _ thick _ velocity slice regime , where density spectra can be obtained .",
    "which regime is realized depends on the comparison between the characteristic difference of turbulence velocities between two los and the velocity channel width .",
    "the slice is _ thin _ if @xmath58 ( ) .",
    "thus , to measure velocity effects in vca , one either needs a narrow velocity channel or the measurements of correlations at sufficiently separated los . in practice , the minimal width of channels is determined by the spectral resolution of the instrument , while wider channels are obtained synthetically by coadding signal of individual high resolution channels ( assuming for simplicity that channels are co - adjacent ) .",
    "this gives vca the ability to separate velocity and density effects , if thin channel regime is available , by varying the slice thickness in the analysis .",
    "here we note that thermal broadening interferes with the ability to carry out thin slice measurements by effectively increasing the channel thickness as @xmath59 .",
    "thus , vca is most effective for supersonic turbulence or when used with lines from massive species with slow thermal velocities",

    "[ sec : thickslice ] .",
    "main observation here is that when optical depth through the volume exceeds unity along all los , @xmath69 , the intensity fluctuations due to density fluctuations are exponentially suppressed .",
    "this comes from compensation between density variations along the line of sight and corresponding variations of the physical los distance @xmath65 at which @xmath70 reaches unity .",
    "this can be seen by approximating exponential cutoff in los integral by a step @xmath71 function @xmath72 after which eq .",
    "gives constant intensity @xmath73 this suppression of density fluctuation is not present when densities of emitters and dust do not follow each other ( in particular , when distribution of dust is taken to be uniform ) , or when intensity is proportional to the square of the emitters density .",
    "it is also absent when absorption is weak , namely optical depth through the cloud is less than unity , @xmath74 .",

    "we have @xmath75 which highlights two main effects of the strong absorption .",
    "strong absorption means small @xmath65 which suggests an estimate @xmath76 thus , firstly , the signal is reduced to the nearest 2d surface of the cloud rather than being integrated along los through 3d volume , and , secondly , the density fluctuations are compensated away , leaving only the velocity induced intensity fluctuations .",
    "however , correlation studies introduce additional scales besides @xmath37 , that can be much shorter , namely the density correlation length @xmath43 and the separation between pairs of los , @xmath77 which can be taken arbitrarily small ( limited by the instrument resultion ) .",
    "thus we must consider whether @xmath78 and @xmath79 are small or large before concluding whether @xmath65 is sufficiently small or not .",
    "the estimate eq .",
    "seemingly reguires density to be near constant through @xmath80 $ ] los interval , but to what extend it is essential to the described picture ?",
    "we can develop a more precise estimate rewriting eq .   by integrating by parts @xmath81\\nonumber\\\\ + \\int_0^s\\mathrm{d}z\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi_v(\\bm{x})}{\\mathrm{d}z}\\mathrm{e}^{-\\kappa\\int_0^z\\mathrm{d}z'\\,\\rho(z')}\\bigg)~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to eliminate density pre - factor before applying @xmath71-function approximation for the exponential term .",

    "we leave this exponentially suppressed term here just to show that eq .",
    "is consistent with eq .",
    "when the velocities in the spectral line are integrated over . otherwise , we may just write @xmath83 this expression explicitly neglects the width of the region to @xmath65 , but does not , however , assume anything about the density uniformity .",
    "thus , the conclusion about 2d surface nature of the signal at high absorption holds independently on density properties .",
    "density fluctuations are introduced only through fluctuations of the los positions of this surface , and one can expect that if @xmath84 does not fluctuate much , contribution of density fluctuations is small .",
    "this is the manifestation of density fluctuation suppression discussed above .    in the following sub - sections ,",
    "we discuss with more rigour two important vca regimes : thin velocity slice and thick velocity slice regimes .",
    "we are first interested in a simpler case of thick velocity channel . in this case , all emission along the los is collected independent of the velocity of emitters , which can be seen using eqs . and",
    "with @xmath85 , which gives @xmath86~,\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the column - density , and is given by @xmath88    eq . shows that dust absorption leads to exponential suppression of density contribution .",
    "thus , making measurements in thick slices in the presence of dust is informative only when absorption is not too large ( more accurate criteria for extent absorption is discussed further on ) . due to the appearance of density dependence in exponential fashion , in the presence of dust one",
    "has to carry out further analysis with an explicit model of density field , unlike in , where no assumption about the model of density field had to be made .",
    "statistics of the column density @xmath89 is discussed in the appendix  [ appcolumn ] . for density field with steep spectrum of fluctuations , the most relevant case is when density dispersion is less than the mean density .",
    "therefore , we can model density fluctuations @xmath90 as a gaussian random field , with @xmath91 .",
    "this translates to the gaussian behaviour of the column density as well .    on the other hand , for shallow density field , a more appropriate and general model for the density field",
    "is log - normal field .",
    "numerical calculations present in appendix [ appcolumn ] show that column density @xmath92 for a shallow density still tends to be gaussian if the integration length @xmath37 along the los is much larger than the correlation length @xmath43 of density field ( which can be easily satisfied for shallow spectra , as @xmath43 in this case is very small ) .",
    "this is because , outside of the correlation length , the fluctuations of density are essentially independent ( as correlation decays outside of correlation length ) , and the sum of uncorrelated random fluctuations should tend to gaussian quantity according to the central limit theorem .",
    "the near gaussian nature of the column - density is clearly illustrated in fig .",

    ", correlation function approach is useful if density spectrum is shallow with @xmath108 . in this case",
    ".   leads to a very interesting conclusion that one can recover density scaling as in usual thick slice vca even in the presence of dust if one studies correlation of intensity at large lags @xmath77 .",

    "this condition is more and more limiting as fluctuations of the optical depth grow beyond @xmath111 , but may still be satisfied for shallow density which has small correlation length @xmath43 .    for @xmath112",

    "is estimated by setting @xmath116 , which now gives @xmath117 where we note that eq .   and eq .   are equivalent .",
    "thus , by measuring structure function of density in thick slices , one can recover density spectra at scales @xmath118 .",
    "for steep spectra with @xmath119 and @xmath44 the critical scale is less than the size of the cloud , i.e. @xmath120 only when dust optical fluctuations are exceeding unity , while for weak absorption fluctuations it is comparable to the size of the cloud , i.e. @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , in the case when dust inhomogeneity is strong , the recovery of steep density statistics in thick velocity slices may be limited by the spatial resolution of telescope .",

    "thus , the advantage of interferometric study is that one can directly use raw interferometric data in order to obtain power spectrum , instead of creating intensity maps and constructing correlations .",
    "this is highly useful in studying turbulence in poorly resolved clouds . to obtain information about spectrum , just a few measurements corresponding to different baselines @xmath296 of an interferometer are sufficient , while measurements relative to different angular orientation of baselines are required for obtaining the information about anisotropies",
    "several studies ( see @xcite ) suggest that the orion nebula is dusty . the study of the reddening of the brightest region of the orion nebula as well as the behaviour of the he i lines @xmath297 and @xmath298 in @xcite suggests that the dust and gas in the orion are well mixed .",
    "thus , the results of this paper are applicable to this nebula .",
    "more importantly , ionised gas usually leads to collisionally excited emission lines . in this paper , we have discussed how vca works with collisionally excited emission lines and shown that the previous analytical results are applicable even for the collisionally excited emission lines .",
    "the study of turbulence in ionised orion nebula has been carried out by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) by analysing observational data through vca and centroids .",
    "thus , our results validate the calculations performed by in order to find spectral index of velocity and density fields .",
    "however , one important point to note is that for strong dust absorption , density effects are suppressed .",
    "therefore , this changes the result for shallow density spectra .    of the results presented in , the most relevant ones for comparison with our prediction in the power spectrum of intensity fluctuations of various spectral lines in the _ thin velocity slice _ regime .",
    "in this regime , our prediction was that the power spectrum of intensity fluctuations exhibits a break in the slope , and the breakpoint is characteristic to the mean strength of dust absorption .",
    "moreover , the change in slope between the two regimes should be of unity .",
    "we used data points obtained from to perform fit of the largest scales ( smallest @xmath172 ) , which was missing in .",
    "the so obtained plots for various spectral lines are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : obser1 ] . note that we do not include any dispersion in the slopes of power spectrum , unlike in , where dispersion in slopes were from the different samplings of the ppv slits .",
    "also notice the difference in fig .",
    "[ fig : obser1 ] , where @xmath299 is plotted against @xmath172 and our schematic representation in fig .",
    "[ powerspec ] , where @xmath170 is plotted against @xmath172 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : obser1 ] , clearly , there is a break in the spectral slope , and the difference in the slope is close to unity for all the spectral lines .",
    "moreover , the characteristic break point for all the spectral lines is of order @xmath300 pc@xmath301 , which corresponds to the dust - absorption cut - off @xmath302 pc . for a medium ionization zone of orion nebula , whose markers are [ o iii ] , h ii , he i and [ cl iii ] , @xcite quote that the optical depths ( which should be of similar to dust - absorption cut - off ) is @xmath303 pc , totally consistent to our @xmath302 pc . thus , one possible reason for this break is the dust extinction .",
    "notice that , in fig .",
    "[ fig : obser1 ] , different spectral lines have different break points , which is naturally expected as different spectral lines have different @xmath26 values .",
    "also notice that some of the markers in fig .",
    "[ fig : obser1 ] , [ n ii ] marks low ionization zone and [ s ii ] marks ionization front . ; @xcite find that the ionization front has an optical depth of @xmath304 pc and low ionization zone @xmath305 pc .",
    "our @xmath144 for these spectral lines seems to be different from the results of ; and @xcite , thus it is difficult to assert if the break in the slopes for these spectral lines is due to dust - absorption .",
    "in this paper , we showed how dust absorption affects different statistical methods to study turbulence .",
    "our results suggest that vca , vcs and velocity centroids are able to trace velocity spectra even in the presence of dust absorption .",
    "however , it might not be possible to obtain density spectra with these techniques , especially if dust absorption is strong and the resolution of telescope is poor .    in the presence of dust absorption , power spectrum of intensity fluctuations in the thin - slice regime",
    "has spectral index greater than -2 at small @xmath172 , while at large @xmath172 , it has spectral index less than -2 . thus it is appropriate to use correlation function at large @xmath77 , while structure function is appropriate at small @xmath77 .",
    "our results suggest that density fluctuation is unimportant if dust absorption is strong as one effectively samples signals from only optical optical depth of unity , or equivalently from a fixed column - density .",
    "this allows one to obtain cleaner velocity statistics at larger scales . to study velocity and density spectra",
    ", one can also use power spectrum of intensity fluctuations . in the language of power spectrum of the intensity fluctuations , the spectral slope changes by unity ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : thin ] ) .",
    "] , at the critical break point @xmath306 .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that at the lags @xmath77 associated with these wavenumbers , the depth along los is much smaller than the separation between the lines of sight , thus statistics are effectively two dimensional .",
    "the break in the slope near dust cut - off scale is also exhibited by centroids .",
    "thus , study of velocity spectra is possible using both centroids and thin velocity slice regime of vca even in the presence of strong dust absorption , albeit intensity signal will be diminished if the dust absorption is strong .    on the other hand , one can only study density spectra if absorption is not strong by either using structure function at short scales @xmath77 or by using correlation function at large scales @xmath77 .",
    "our calculations show that the correlation length set by dust absorption is short for shallow density and long for steep density .",
    "thus , it is appropriate to study steep density using structure function , while correlation function is appropriate for shallow density .",
    "an important limitation is that the amplitude of correlation function is exponentially suppressed , and thus it is challenging to measure this correlation especially if instrumental noise is not properly factored out .",
    "we stress that in the thin slice regime of vca , density effects are not important if dust absorption is strong , and only velocity statistics is manifested in the intensity statistics .",
    "this allows one to cleanly obtain velocity spectra even if the information of density spectra is not available .",
    "our results in this paper show that dust absorption _",
    "effectively _ decreases the extent of self - absorption .",
    "this means that the universal regime @xmath0 of intensity statistics , originally obtained in , is suppressed by strong dust absorption ; in particular , the range of scale where one can see universal regime is decreased by a factor of @xmath307 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cut - off in physical space introduced by dust absorption decreases the velocity window introduced by self - absorption , thus suppressing the universal regime .",
    "our results also show that one can study intensity anisotropies even in the presence of dust absorption .",
    "however , in the context of vca , dust absorption might lead to isotropization of statistics if proper statistical measure is not used .",
    "in particular , dust absorption leads to isotropic structure function at lags @xmath142 , where one needs to use correlation function in order to study both spectrum and anisotropy of intensity fluctuations .",
    "similarly , one needs to study both spectrum and anisotropy at small @xmath77 for thick velocity slice limit of steep density .",
    "this ambiguity of choice of statistical measure is resolved if one studies anisotropy using power spectrum of intensity fluctuations .",
    "we stress that our description of anisotropy of interstellar turbulence uses the theory of strong non - linear mhd turbulence .",
    "the theory , including the issues of anisotropies , has been studied extensively both theoretically and numerically , in particular in the papers by @xcite and @xcite . in these papers",
    "the anisotropies of mhd turbulence were studied for a wide range of sonic and alfvn mach numbers .",
    "these anisotropies are not expected to depend on the ionization of the media , provided that the scales under study are larger than the scale of the decoupling of ions and neutrals ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , our description of anisotropies applies to both turbulence within ionized gas in massive star forming regions and diffuse multiphase interstellar medium .",
    "moreover , we study the anisotropies arising from the sub - alfvnic and trans - alfvnic turbulence .    in the context of vcs",
    ", we showed that both narrow beam and wide beam asymptote remain the same even in the presence of dust absorption .",
    "however , an important consequence of dust absorption is that the effective width of telescope beam @xmath204 increases , and one will be able to obtain narrow beam only if this width is less than the dust cut - off , i.e. @xmath209 .",
    "this might be difficult to achieve if dust absorption is strong .",
    "finally , an important piece of work that was carried out was understanding how different analytical techniques work with collisionally excited emission lines .",
    "our results show that overall , all the analytical expressions and asymptotic predictions obtained in the previous studies are applicable to collisionally excited emission lines .",
    "however , an interesting regime is when dust absorption is present . in this case ,",
    "density effects are not suppressed for collisionally excited emission lines even when dust absorption is strong .    in conclusion ,",
    "the previous techniques of studying turbulence applied to mostly radio lines .",
    "our study suggests that these techniques can be applied even to the optical and ultra - violet ( uv ) lines for which dust absorption can not be neglected .",
    "in carrying out the analysis in this paper , we used several assumptions .",
    "firstly , we considered the case when emission is proportional to the density of emitters , which excludes the case of collisionally excited emission , where emission proportional to the square of density of emitters . secondly , we assumed dust density to be proportional to the gas density .",
    "correlation between hi and 100 micron ( see @xcite ) justifies this assumption for the gas clouds in the ism .",
    "thirdly , we assumed that the dust extinction coefficient @xmath26 is independent of frequency within the frequency range of doppler broadened spectral line .",
    "while this is not strictly true , it does not affect our analysis in any significant manner , especially in the case when thermal broadening of intensity profile is not significant .",
    "it is important to note that the dust extinction coefficient is different for different emission lines .",
    "although density is better modelled as log - normal field , we argued that the column density can be approximated with reasonable accuracy to be gaussian . for steep density ,",
    "the density dispersion is small , therefore density and thus column - density can be modelled as gaussian . for shallow density , we showed in appendix [ appcolumn ] that if the los depth is larger than the correlation length of the field , column - density tends to be gaussian",
    ".    to study anisotropy of intensity correlations , we explicitly used models of different mhd modes , and obtained anisotropy for each of these modes . description of turbulence in terms of mhd cascades is only applicable if these mhd modes approximately form independent cascade . numerical study carried out by @xcite shows that the coupling between various mhd modes is marginal as long as sonic mach number is not too high , thus validating the applicability of this decomposition .      in this paper",
    ", we mainly focused on how dust absorption affects vca , vcs and centroids .",
    "however , there are other techniques to study turbulence , and these are also likely to be affected by dust absorption .",
    "an important technique to study turbulence using velocity slice of ppv space is the spectral correlation function ( scf , see @xcite ) .",
    "scf is very similar to vca if one removes the adjustable parameters from it , as both of these technique measure correlations of intensity in velocity slices of ppv .",
    "however , scf treats outcomes empirically .",
    "the description of how intensity is affected by dust absorption that was presented in this paper is likely to help us understand the effect of dust absorption on scf .",
    "there also exist numerous techniques to identify and analyze clumps and shells in ppv ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , a more advanced technique to study a hierarchical structure of the ppv , namely dendrogram technique @xcite , can provide a complementary insight to the values of sonic and alfvn mach numbers @xcite .",
    "synergy of these different available techniques is very important to obtain a comprehensive picture of mhd turbulence .      in ,",
    "a number of techniques were suggested aimed at obtaining the information about magnetic field and the density of cosmic electrons using synchrotron intensity and polarization measurements .",
    "these techniques use position - position - frequency ( ppf ) cube ( an analogue of ppv cube used in the vca ) .",
    "such studies provide a complimentary method to study the mean magnetic field direction , the degree of magnetization of the media and the contribution of alfvn , slow and fast modes in a turbulent cloud .",
    "understanding the properties of turbulent cascade in different interstellar phases is essential to understand the dynamics of the ism as well as the transport process of heat and cosmic rays .",
    "while the turbulence in hi and molecular gas is well studied via spectroscopic measurements , synchrotron emission is useful in studying diffuse hot and warm turbulent media .",
    "the correspondence of the different important parameters characterizing mhd turbulence in different interstellar phases would testify a single turbulent cascade on the galactic scale , which can be a finding with important consequences for different branches of astrophysical research , e.g. for cosmic ray physics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since dust absorption is important at shorter wavelengths , it is less likely to affect synchrotron studies . thus , synergy of synchrotron studies with spectroscopic studies can be beneficial to understand magnetic properties of a turbulent medium , even when it is significantly dusty",
    "on the basis of the analytical theory of the intensity fluctuations in the ppv space developed in the earlier works (; ; ; ) we provided the analytical description of how the results of those works are affected by dust absorption .",
    "the results of our study within the assumptions that were used can be summarized as follows :    * simple model of dust absorption was used to show how dust absorption affects study of vca . in particular",
    ", it was shown that it is possible to obtain velocity spectra in the thin slice regime of vca even if dust absorption is present .",
    "however , the spectral index of power spectrum of intensity changes by one at low wavenumbers to high wavenumbers .",
    "this change corresponds to studying the statistics at the scales comparable to the thickness of the dust layer with the optical depth of unity .",
    "* it was shown that the velocity spectra can be obtained using centroids in the presence of dust absorption .",
    "similar to the vca , the centroids , due to dust absorption , exhibit the break in the spectral slope of centroid structure function .",
    "the reason for that is the same as in the case of the vca , namely the transfer to studying 2d surface layer of turbulence .",
    "* the study of turbulence using vcs in the presence of dust absorption shows that the asymptotes at different wavenumbers @xmath192 for both poor and high resolution beam remains the same as in the case of negligible dust absorption .",
    "one can state therefore , that the technique is robust in relation to the dust absorption . *",
    "anisotropies measured by both vca and centroids at small 2d lags @xmath77 are unaffected by dust absorption , whereas at larger lags one needs to use proper statistical measure ( either correlation function or power spectrum ) in order to study anisotropies . * in the presence of both dust absorption and self - absorption of the gas , the statistics of the observed total intensities and velocity centroids change .",
    "in particular , the universal regime of fluctuations @xmath308 that is independent from both underlying velocity and density fluctuations disappears when dust cut - off is much smaller than the los extent of the cloud .",
    "this allows study of velocity spectra even when self - absorption is present . *",
    "all the analytical formulations of vca , vcs and centroids are valid even with collisionally excited emission lines . however , in the regime of strong dust absorption , density effects are not suppressed for collisionally excited emission lines . *",
    "our theoretical expectations correspond to the observations of turbulence in hii regions and explain the change of the spectral slope that is reported for studies of fluctuations at large scales .",

    "for instance , kolmogorov index for 3d density , @xmath335 will result in steep @xmath336 scaling of the column density structure function .",

    "let us turn to the kind of statistical model appropriate for column density .",
    "for a steep density spectra , fluctuations are smaller than the mean density , and gaussian approximation for density fluctuations works well which translates to gaussian behaviour of the column densty . however , for shallow density , fluctuations can be larger than the mean density , and thus density fluctuations follow lognormal distribution better than the gaussian distribution .",
    "if so , what kind of distribution does column density follow ?",
    "we answer this question numerically . for",
