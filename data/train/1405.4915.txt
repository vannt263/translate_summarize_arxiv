    "evidence for efimov three - body bound states , which were proposed originally in the context of nuclear physics @xcite , has been observed in a number of ultracold atom gas experiments @xcite . in principle , near a magnetic - field feshbach resonance @xcite there exists an infinite number of three - body bound states that follow a discrete scaling law .",
    "the primary signature of these three - body states in cold atom gases has been resonantly enhanced three - body loss of trapped atoms .",
    "a loss resonance occurs at a negative value of the two - body scattering length @xmath2 , which is denoted @xmath3 , where the energy of the efimov state coincides with the scattering threshold energy for three atoms @xcite , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : efimov ] ( a ) .",
    "several experiments have observed multiple efimov loss features whose locations follow discrete scaling , with each @xmath3 larger than that of the last by a factor of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a universal parameter @xcite .",
    "an additional signature of efimov states can be found when the energy of an efimov state coincides with the threshold scattering energy for a feshbach molecule and an atom .",
    "this occurs at a positive value of @xmath2 denoted @xmath6 and results in resonant collisional loss in a trapped gas mixture of feshbach molecules and atoms .",
    "atom - molecule loss resonances have been observed for @xmath7li @xcite , @xmath8cs @xcite , and the mixture of @xmath0k and @xmath1rb @xcite .",
    "in addition , unanticipated resonances in the loss of trapped atoms at positive @xmath2 values , without initially creating molecules , have been seen for @xmath9li @xcite , @xmath10k @xcite , and the mixture of @xmath11k and @xmath1rb @xcite .",
    "the observed loss features are relatively small , with the increase in the atom loss rate ranging from about a factor of two to a factor of five .",
    "the features can be quite narrow , with the width ranging from a few @xmath12 to a few hundred @xmath12 , where @xmath12 is the bohr radius .",
    "these resonances are believed to be related to @xmath6 and have been attributed to an avalanche mechanism @xcite , whereby feshbach molecules that are produced by non - resonant three - body recombination eject atoms from the trap via resonant , secondary atom - molecule collisions .",
    "however , there has not yet been an observation of an avalanche feature and an atom - molecule loss resonance in the same system .",
    "in addition , a recent theoretical simulation suggests that the avalanche mechanism fails to produce a narrow atom loss feature near the atom - dimer resonance @xcite .",
    "the observation of an atom loss feature does not require the preparation of feshbach molecules and therefore can be a simpler method for experimentally locating @xmath6 .",
    "however , it is important to verify the connection of observed avalanche peaks with atom - molecule efimov resonances . in previous work @xcite",
    ", we measured an atom - molecule loss resonance for @xmath0k@xmath1rb feshbach molecules and @xmath1rb atoms , but did not see any corresponding loss feature for an atom gas prepared without creating a population of trapped feshbach molecules .",

    "[ fig : efimov ] ( b ) , showing resonant loss around @xmath14 . because this data could have missed a narrow or a small amplitude avalanche peak , we present here additional atom loss measurements on the positive @xmath2 side of the @xmath0k@xmath15rb feshbach resonance .",
    "in particular , in order to search for an efimov - related avalanche feature , we take many more data points with a finer spacing in @xmath2 . in addition",
    ", we ensure uniformity of the initial atom gas conditions as we change @xmath2 , since variation of the densities or temperature could shift or broaden a resonance feature @xcite .",
    "finally , we look for features in both the atom loss as well as the ratio of the number loss for rb and k , since the avalanche mechanism should result in additional loss of rb atoms from the resonant , secondary collisions .     efimov bound states . at @xmath16 , resonant enhancement of three - body recombination",
