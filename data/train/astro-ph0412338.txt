    "when an ultra high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) particle enters the atmosphere it interacts producing an extensive air shower that propagates through it and reaches ground level .",
    "these showers are routinely detected by optical systems that collect fluorescence light emitted by nitrogen molecules excited as the front crosses the atmosphere , and by arrays of particle detectors that sample at ground level an enormous shower front which can exceed @xmath0 particles . in these arrays",
    "the relative times of the detected signals allow the reconstruction of the incoming particle arrival direction .",
    "the time distribution of the arriving signal has been known for long to be dependent on the depth distribution of the shower particles @xcite which is different for different primary particles .",
    "exploring the highest energy particles is now considered to be a priority because the data are scarce , there are discrepancies between results obtained with the two techniques and because the origin of these particles is not at all understood @xcite .",
    "their study is expected to provide both information on violent objects in the universe where these particles originate and on their interactions ( during propagation and in the atmosphere ) at energies exceeding those achieved in accelerator experiments by many orders of magnitude .",
    "new experiments are being constructed and devised to improve the statistics , to increase the precision and to establish the mass of the primary particles .",
    "the auger observatory in argentina is the first of a new generation of large aperture experiments .",
    "it combines the two techniques and for the ground array it uses water erenkov tanks with photomultiplier tubes and flash analog to digital converters ( fadc ) to record the time stamp of the signal in 25 ns intervals with unprecedented accuracy @xcite .",
    "the perspective of improved detectors has triggered an increase of phenomenological activity in the study and characterization of extensive air showers .",
    "evaluation of the time structure of showers is part of this effort motivated by both the practical need of controlling the uncertainties in the arrival direction reconstruction and also by the hope that its understanding might shed new light on the challenging problem of establishing their composition .",
    "the idea of relating the muon distributions to the shower development has been already quite successful @xcite .",
    "the arrival time distributions of muons has been characterized using simple geometrical and kinematical arguments and making a key simplifying assumption on the muon energy , transverse momentum , and distance of production distributions , namely that they are independent @xcite .",
    "here we have further developed the algorithm that relates the arrival time distribution of muons to the depth development of the shower following on these ideas .",
    "the scope of the method is limited because the shower front contains many other particles , mainly electrons and photons . in principle",
    "it requires muon identification but fortunately the muon signal dominates in two circumstances : when the shower is inclined and the electromagnetic part does not reach ground level @xcite but also for `` more vertical '' showers when the distance to shower axis is sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "the method complements alternative depth reconstruction methods which are always limited when only densities at ground level are taken into consideration .",
    "moreover when the effects of arrival angle and impact point misreconstruction are taken into account it is seen that the induced distributions have a minimum in their spread for the correct angle and impact point .",
    "this effect opens the possibility of using this method for improving the confidence in the conventional angular and impact point reconstructions . while the precision obtained is possibly insufficient to be used for composition studies it will certainly have an important impact on improving the acceptance of air shower arrays to neutrinos through inclined showers .",
    "the accuracy in the depth development reconstruction is sufficient to exclude neutrino interactions at intermediate depths , when the electromagnetic shower would have been completely absorbed but the first interaction is sufficiently deep into the atmosphere to exclude both a cosmic ray hadron and a photon .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section ii we summarize the factorization hypothesis for the muon distributions and the relations that follow , and motivate the inversion of the relation between the time and depth distribution from ref .  @xcite .",
    "we also pay some attention to the relation between particle densities and detector geometric acceptance . in section",
    "iii we present the method to reconstruct the depth distribution . in section",
    "iv we compare the depth distributions obtained with this reconstruction method to actual distributions from simulated showers to test it . in section v discussing some practical limitations . in section",
    "vi we explore the correlations between the reconstruction procedure and the assumed arrival direction and impact point as a check of its robustness ; we summarize and conclude in section vii .",
    "technical details are presented in two appendices .",
    "the main features of the arrival time distributions of muons in extensive air showers can be accounted for by the different path lengths traveled by the muons from their production point .",
    "this has been recently shown using a simplified model to describe the muons in air showers which is based on the hypothesis that their energy , @xmath1 , transverse momentum , @xmath2 , production distance , @xmath3 , and outgoing polar angle , @xmath4 distributions factorize @xcite @xmath5 in this expression @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 refer to production , @xmath3 is measured along the shower axis from the muon production point to the ground .",
    "the transverse momentum is transverse to shower axis and has polar angle @xmath4 in the transverse plane ( perpendicular to shower axis ) .",
    "the functions @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are assumed independent and normalized to 1 and the factor @xmath10 accounts for a uniform polar angle distribution .",
    "finally @xmath11 , the total number of produced muons , is the overall normalization . in this model",
    "the muons are assumed to travel in straight lines and these four variables are sufficient to determine the muon path uniquely .",
    "it is convenient to express the muon direction in terms of the angle @xmath12 with respect to shower axis . for a muon produced with energy @xmath1 and transverse momentum @xmath2 , the angle @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 we can approximate @xmath14 , because the muon energy at ground level is typically greater than @xmath15 , this energy at production is even greater because of muon energy loss .",

    "the distribution of surviving muons can then be integrated in @xmath1 in order to obtain the depth distribution of the surviving muons , which is given in terms of two angles describing the muon direction , namely @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
