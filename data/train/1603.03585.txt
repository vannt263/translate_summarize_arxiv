    "in school we all dealt , in one way or another , with solids such as prisms and pyramids , but maybe also with bipyramids .",
    "the aim of this paper is to generalize these solids as different products of abstract polytopes , and study their symmetry and combinatorial properties .",
    "prisms , pyramids and bipyramids over polygons ( see figure  [ pentagons ] ) can be seen as a product of a polygon by either a segment or a point . however , these are three different kinds of products . while prisms are the cartesian product of a segment with a polygon , pyramids are the join product of a point with a polygon and bipyramids are the direct product of a segment with a polygon . in the theory of convex polytopes the generalization of these three notions",
    "are the cartesian product , the join product and the direct sum , respectively ( @xcite ) . given two convex polytopes @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "their products are defined as follows .",
    "the join of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is obtained by embedding @xmath2 and @xmath3 in disjoint affine subspaces of @xmath4 and taking the convex hull of their vertices .",
    "for example , for each @xmath5 , a @xmath6-simplex can be seen as the join of a point and a @xmath7-simplex ( figure  [ joinpowersofapoint ] ) .",
    "-simplex is the join product of a point and a @xmath7-simplex.,width=377 ]    the cartesian product of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is obtained by taking the convex hull of @xmath8 in @xmath9 .",
    "the classical example in this case , is to see a @xmath6-cube as the cartesian product of an edge -or line segment- with a @xmath7-cube ( as in figure  [ cartesianpowersofaedge ] ) .",
    "-cube is the cartesian product of an edge and a @xmath7-cube.,width=377 ]    the direct sum of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is slightly more complicated to state .",
    "we first require that @xmath2 and @xmath3 contain in their relative interiors the origins of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "then the direct sum is the convex hull of all the points of the form @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "for example , cross polytopes can be generated in this way .",
    "note that as where in the join product and cartesian product of convex polytopes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , every face of @xmath2 and of @xmath3 is again a face of the product , for the direct sum this is no longer the case . on the other hand , for both the join product and the direct sum , the vertices of the product is the union of the vertices of both polytopes , while the cartesian product of two polytopes , in general , has more vertices .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the only convex polyhedra ( or convex 3-polytopes ) that arise as one of these products are precisely the prisms , the pyramids and the bipyramids over polygons .",
    "it is also well - know that , in @xmath16 , the product of two orthogonal circles @xmath17 is precisely the _ flat torus _ ( also known as the clifford torus , @xcite ) . if we place @xmath18 points on each of the circles , evenly spaced , we obtain @xmath18 congruent line segments on each circle .",
    "then , take the cartesian product of each point of each @xmath19 with line segment of the other @xmath19 .",
    "what you obtain is a tessellation of the flat torus by squares ( see figure  [ torus ] ) .",
    "hence , some maps on surfaces can also be seen as products of polygons .",
    "abstract polytopes generalize the ( face lattice ) of convex polytopes .",
    "moreover , they also generalize non - degenerated maps .",
    "hence , it is natural to generalise the four products described above and define them for abstract polytopes , and we do so in section  [ sec : allproducts ] . as we show , the four products are closed for abstract polytopes , meaning that the product of two abstract polytopes is again an abstract polytope ( under any of the four products ) .",
    "we shall also study , for each product , which polytopes are trivial , in the sense that the product of them with any polytope @xmath2 is simply @xmath2 . with that in mind",
    ", it is natural to say that a polytope is prime with respect to a given product , if it can not be decomposed as the product of non - trivial polytopes .",
    "we show a unique prime factorization theorem and use it to investigate the structure of the automorphism group of a product .",
    "theorem a summarizes the main results of sections  [ sec : allproducts ] , [ sec : fact ] and [ sec : auto ] .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be two abstract polytopes and @xmath20 be a product of polytopes ( either the direct sum , the join , cartesian or topological product ) .",
    "then ,    1 .   the product @xmath21 is an abstract polytope . in particular",
    ", @xmath22 is also an abstract polytope .",
    "the polytope @xmath2 can be uniquely factorized as a product of prime polytopes .",
    "3 .   if @xmath23 , where the @xmath24 are distinct prime polytope with respect to @xmath20 , then @xmath25 4 .",
    "if @xmath2 is decomposed as above , where @xmath24 is a @xmath26-orbit polytope , then @xmath2 is a @xmath27-orbit polytope , with @xmath28 where if @xmath20 is the join product , then @xmath29 is the rank of @xmath24 , if @xmath20 is either the cartesian product or the direct sum , then @xmath30 is the rank of @xmath24 , and if @xmath20 is the topological product , then @xmath31 is the rank of @xmath24    as a corollary of part @xmath32 of theorem a , for each product , we also obtained the families of regular and two - orbit polytopes that are not prime .",
    "the monodromy group of a polytope ( either convex or abstract ) encodes all the combinatorial information of the polytope .",
    "it was first studied by hartley in @xcite and he used it to construct regular covers of ( non - regular ) polytopes .",
    "it is well - know that the monodromy group of a regular polytope is isomorphic to its automorphism group .",
    "however , little is known about monodromy groups of non - regular polytopes . in the last decade",

    "furthermore , the generators in ( [ genmonoprism ] ) become : @xmath778    we start by noticing that @xmath779 has order 3 .",

    "in fact , it is not too difficult to see that @xmath787 and @xmath788 generate @xmath48 .",

    "* section 6 ) ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see ( using the description of the generators as elements of @xmath666 ) that @xmath294 is normal in @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , the elements of the quotient @xmath797 are simply @xmath798 , implying that @xmath799 . in other words",

    "let @xmath345 be an integer , and @xmath2 be a @xmath55-polytope such that all its vertex figures are isomorphic to @xmath345-gons ( these polytopes are sometimes called _ uniform _ maps , however , the notation is not standard as _ uniform _ in other contexts means that the polytope is vertex - transitive ) . consider the prism over @xmath2 .",
    "then , the generators of @xmath763 are @xmath804 note that @xmath805 is isomorphic to the monodromy group of the pyramid over a @xmath345-gon .",

    "@xmath817 , so @xmath818 is a split extension of @xmath819 by @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , @xmath820 and @xmath821 hence , the kernel @xmath48 is generated by @xmath822 and @xmath823 . a simple computation shows",
    "then that @xmath824 , where @xmath825 $ ] is the least common multiple of @xmath345 and @xmath373 . moreover , it is straightforward to see that these two groups commute implying that @xmath826 and @xmath827    in fact , it is not difficult to extend these techniques to show that , if @xmath24 is a @xmath748-gon , then @xmath828 where @xmath345 is the least common multiple of @xmath829 .",
    "we note here that this result is not surprising at all , since the monodromy group of a polytope @xmath2 is isomorphic to the minimal regular cover of @xmath2 , whenever such cover is unique ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the minimal regular cover of @xmath830 is the regular polytope @xmath831 , where @xmath3 is a @xmath345-gon ( @xmath832 $ ] ) and the power is taken over the @xmath636-product .",
    "as we have pointed out before , computing the monodromy group of non - regular polytopes is a difficult task . in this paper",
    "we showed that by regarding some polytopes as products this task can be simplified .",
    "in particular we think that the computations needed to calculate the monodromy groups of prisms and pyramids over polygons are fairly easy , specially if one compares them to those of @xcite and @xcite . for this reason",
    "we strongly believe that the techniques used here can be extended in order to compute monodromy groups of other interesting products and think it is an interesting project to pursue .",
