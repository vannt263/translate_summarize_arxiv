    "an endogenous crash is preceded by an unstable phase where any information is amplified ; this critical period takes the name of speculative bubble.    recurrence plots are graphical tools elaborated by eckmann , kamphorst and ruelle in 1987 and are based on phase space reconstruction @xcite . in 1992 ,",
    "zbilut and webber @xcite proposed a statistical quantification of rps and gave it the name of recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa ) .",
    "rp and rqa are good in working with non stationarity and noisy data , in detecting changes in data behavior , in particular in detecting breaks , like a phase transition @xcite , and in informing about other dynamic properties of a time series @xcite .",
    "most of the applications of rp and rqa are at this time in the field of physiology and biology , but some authors have already applied these techniques to financial data @xcite .",
    "we have used rp and rqa techniques for detecting critical regimes preceding an endogenous crash seen as a phase transition and whence give an estimation of the initial bubble time .",
    "it has been simulated a signal as in [ log ] , the analysis is made on nasdaq , taken over a time span of 6 years including the known crash of april 2000 @xcite .",
    "the series are also divided into subseries in order to investigate changes in the evolution of the signal",
    ". then the rps of all time series have been observed , compared and discussed .",
    "this work is extracted by @xcite .",
    "the changing state of a dynamic system can be indeed represented by sequences of state vectors in the phase space .",
    "each unknown point of the phase space at time @xmath8 is reconstructed by the delayed vector @xmath9 in an @xmath10-dimensional space .",
    "[ [ recurrence - plot ] ] recurrence plot + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the recurrence plot ( rp ) is a matrix of points @xmath11 where each point is said to be recurrent and marked with a dot if the distance between the delayed vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 is less than a given threshold @xmath14 . as",
    "each coordinate @xmath8 represents a point in time , rp provides information about the temporal correlation of phase space points @xcite .    therefore rps can be used to test a system deterministic behavior through the percentage of recurrent points belonging to parallel lines .",
    "in fact for a periodic or a deterministic signal patterns like parallel lines appear . in so doing , rps are useful tools for the preprocessing of experimental time series and provide a comprehensive image of the dynamic course at a glance @xcite .",

    "the shannon entropy of the distribution of the length of line segments parallel to the main diagonal ( ent ) .",
    "in order to study the crash from the point of view of a phase transition with log periodic precursors , a log periodic signal , generated by equation ( [ log ] ) , has been simulated , its rp is shown in fig . [",

    "after studied the whole time series the data has been divided into subseries of 200 days , overlapping each other of almost 5 months , in order to further analyze whether and how the data changes .    fig .",

    "[ figcrash ] . considering that each coordinate in rp is linked with the time series , the border line of a grey or black band reveals the time when the data behavior starts to change . noting that the dates here above fall in the same time interval as the bubble and the subsequent crash , it can be supposed that the initial bubble time occurs at @xmath17 ( oct .",
    ". we can thus deduce that on such a day the evolution of the system changes , i.e. the evolution passes from a normal regime to a critical regime .",
    "this is an a posteriori estimation of the initial bubble time , but through the analysis of the subseries one can argue to be able to recognize the beginning of the bubble with some delay before the bubble grows .",
    "in fact , while the rps of the first ( i ) , the second ( ii ) and of the third ( iii ) subseries do not present any remarkable pattern @xcite ( they are quite homogeneous except some local maximum reached by the index ) the fourth subseries presents an interesting pattern : the rp in figure [ figlog](rhs ) shows the characteristic shape typical of the strong trend of a speculative bubble as studied and pointed out in fig .",
