    "is there a need for quantizing time ?",
    "if one is content with the current situation concerning the fundamental theories , then the answer is clearly `` no '' .",
    "however , it turns out to be more and more difficult to finally merge the two most fundamental theories that we have , namely quantum theory and the theory of general relativity . if one takes the principle of relativity serious , then time and space should be treated on exactly the same footing . quantum theory",
    ", however , treats time in a fundamentally different manner , namely as a classical parameter within a quantized theory . even in quantum field theory the position of a particle is treated differently than the time of its detection : while the field operators @xmath0 are operator - valued distributions over @xmath1 , they are _ not _ distributions over @xmath2 .",
    "rather , the time @xmath2 serves as a classical parameter for the continuous evolution of the system , just like in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "therefore , in my point of view , as long as time is not treated _ exactly _ on the same footing as position , the grand unification of fundamental theories will not succeed .    in this paper a non - relativistic theory of one particle",
    "is presented where time and position both appear as `` canonical '' observables , i.e. as self - adjoint operators on a hilbert space that are no functions of other operators .",
    "this concept requires a modified axiomatic foundation which may seem unfamiliar to the reader .",
    "however , i have tried to keep the axiomatics as simple and intuitive as possible .",
    "the resulting theory includes a theory of measurement which yields the link between the abstract formalism and observations in the real world .",
    "the standard quantum theory turns out to be a special case where all measurements are performed within an infinitely short duration . in order to show that the proposed theory is not only a kind of philosophical and formalistic gymnastics but also provides a toolbox for straight and transparent calculations , fermi s golden rule and the s - matrix in first order are calculated .",
    "now what is the problem with quantizing time ? to put it shortly : a `` quantized '' quantity is represented by an observable ; an observable represents a property of a physical system ; the fundamental system of quantum mechanics is the particle ; `` time '' is not a property of particles .",
    "the problems and peculiarities arising with the construction of a time operator are the mathematical counterparts of this conceptual dilemma .",
    "mathematically , by saying that `` position is a quantized quantity '' we mean that the wave functions @xmath3 are normalized over position space : @xmath4 the time - dependent wave functions @xmath5 are obtained with the help of the time evolution operator @xmath6 : @xmath7 because @xmath6 is unitary we have for all @xmath8 : @xmath9 relation  ( [ tint ] ) explicitely shows that time is not a quantized quantity , because the wave functions @xmath5 are normalized over space but not over time .",
    "nonetheless , let us assume that there is an observable @xmath10 measuring time in some way .",
    "then we would expect that the corresponding heisenberg operator @xmath11 obeys @xmath12 together with the heisenberg equation of motion , relation  ( [ tdt ] ) implies that @xmath10 is conjugate to the hamiltonian @xmath13 of the system , @xmath14=i\\hbar.\\ ] ] defining an energy shift operator by @xmath15 then relation  ( [ th ] ) implies that @xmath16 maps an eigenstate of energy @xmath17 onto an eigenstate of energy @xmath18 : @xmath19 because @xmath20 is an arbitrary real parameter , the spectrum of @xmath13 is @xmath21 .",
    "this contradicts the principle of the _ stability of matter _ which demands that the energy spectrum must be bounded from below .",
    "concluding , there is no self - adjoint operator @xmath10 fulfilling  ( [ th ] ) .",
    "this is the famous theorem by _",
    "wolfgang pauli _ @xcite who wrote :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ we conclude that the introduction of an operator @xmath22 must fundamentally be abandoned and that the time @xmath2 in quantum mechanics has to be regarded as an ordinary real number . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    anyway , during the almost 80 years between pauli s theorem and today there have been numerous attempts to introduce an observable @xmath10 with the dimension of time .",
    "these attempts can basically be classified into the following categories :    * one constructs a self - adjoint operator @xmath10 conjugate to a suitably defined _ unbound _ pseudo - hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "there is no general rule for this procedure but there are certain examples that lead to physically sensible quantities , in particular so - called `` arrival time '' operators . @xcite . *",
    "the condition for @xmath10 to be self - adjoint is dropped . instead ,",
    "one looks for a maximally - symmetric operator @xmath10 conjugate to @xmath13 whose eigenvectors are non - orthogonal .",
    "the measurement of @xmath10 is understood within the concept of generalized measurements via povm ( positive operator - valued measure ) @xcite . *",
    "the original proof of pauli has a loophole .",
    "closer investigations show that in certain cases it is possible to find a self - adjoint operator @xmath10 conjugate to @xmath13 in spite of the semi - boundness of @xmath13 .",
    "however , the physical meaning of such an operator remains unclear @xcite .",
    "* a clock system is considered which is described quantum mechanically and whose pointer value is related to the actual time @xcite .",
    "all these approaches are based on the assumption that the time operator is itself subject to time evolution .",
    "the quantity in whose respect this time evolution takes place is still a classical parameter .",
    "therefore , one can not speak of a `` quantization of time '' in the same sense as one speaks of a quantization of position .",
    "in contrast to that , the approach presented in this paper realizes a quantization of time in the very meaning of the word .",
    "closely related to the notion of a time operator is the _ time - energy uncertainty relation _ ,",
    "@xmath24 which is also a controversal issue @xcite .",
    "there are theoretical considerations and experimental facts that strengthen an uncertainty relation between the measured energy of the system and the duration of this measurement .",
    "such a time - energy uncertainty relation can also be derived in a quite general way when considering an interacting environmental system  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that there are particular cases where the duration of an energy measurement does _ not _ affect the uncertainty of the measurement result .",
    "this paradoxical situation can be solved  @xcite if one distinguishes between the measurement of a _ known _ and an _ unknown _ hamiltonian : in case the hamiltonian is unknown it must be _ estimated _ by observing the dynamics of the system .",
    "the uncertainty of such estimation and the duration of the measurement obey a relation of the form  ( [ dedt ] ) . only if the hamiltonian is explicitely known , then it is possible to design a measurement which circumvents a time - energy uncertainty relation .",
    "the peculiarities connected with the time - energy uncertainty relation and those connected with a time operator have a common cause , namely that time is still a _ classical _ element within a quantized theory .    in this paper",
    "a framework is proposed in which time is described as a canonical quantum observable , i.e. by a self - adjoint operator on a hilbert space which is not a function of other operators . since this unavoidably conflicts with the basic concepts of quantum mechanics , we are forced to modify the axiomatic foundations of the standard theory so that time and space are treated _ on exactly the same footing_. the resulting framework will be referred to as `` quantum event theory '' , in short qet .",
    "some consequences of the theory are :    * the ordinary picture of a continuous time evolution is replaced by a discrete sequence of single measurement events occurring in time and space .",
    "* the theory is nonlocal in time , i.e. a particle is not in a certain `` state '' at a certain time . * the dynamics",
    "is entirely driven by measurements .",
    "if there is no measurement then there is no dynamics . *",
    "the dynamics is irreversible , hence one can define an `` arrow of time '' . *",
    "the energy of a particle is not represented by its hamiltonian .",
    "rather , the hamiltonian can be used to _ estimate _ the energy of the particle .",
    "* time and energy obey a canonical uncertainty relation , while the hamiltonian does not obey an uncertainty relation with time .",
    "thus if the hamiltonian is explicitely known it can be measured without any restriction to the duration of the measurement to estimate the particle s energy .",
    "* there is no `` measurement problem '' in that there is no unitary evolution interrupted by quantum jumps .",
    "a particle is actually not the thing we perceive in an experiment .",
    "what we perceive are _ measurement events _ occurring in time and space which we _ relate _ to the presence of a particle .",
    "pointers , led s , oscilloscopes , eyes , ears , these are all _ detectors _ and they form the `` real world '' through our perception . the particle itself is just the imaginary object behind the detector events",
