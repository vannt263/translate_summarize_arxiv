    "<S> we present the first calculations of a symmetry conserving configuration mixing method ( sccm ) using time - reversal symmetry breaking hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) states with the gogny d1s interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the method includes particle number and tridimensional angular momentum symmetry restorations as well as configuration mixing within the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) framework . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleus @xmath0 mg is chosen to show the performance and reliability of the calculations . </S>",

    "<S> each pes is normalized to the energy of their corresponding minima , i.e. , ( a ) -249.902 mev , ( b ) -247.910 mev , ( c ) -246.789 mev , ( d ) -252.924 mev , ( e ) -252.021 mev and ( f ) -250.463 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the black bullets in ( a)-(c ) are the states included in the gcm calculation while the yellow squares in ( c ) are the states analyzed in detail in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3]-  [ figure4 ] . ]    </S>",
    "<S> a trustworthy description of the spectra of the atomic nuclei is one of the main goals of low - energy nuclear structure theory . </S>",
    "<S> the interacting shell model  @xcite is likely the most widely used and successful tool to compute accurately low - lying spectroscopic properties . </S>",
    "<S> however , shell model applications are limited to regions not far away from shell closures where manageable valence spaces can be defined . on the other hand , microscopic self - consistent mean field methods ( scmf )  @xcite based on nuclear energy density functionals such as skyrme </S>",
    "<S> , gogny and/or relativistic mean field ( rmf ) can be in principle used throughout the whole nuclear chart . in order to apply these methods to the study of nuclear spectra </S>",
    "<S> , they have to be extended by including beyond - mean - field ( bmf ) correlations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , symmetry conserving configuration mixing methods ( sccm ) are the most natural extensions of scmf approaches and have shown a fair performance in describing qualitatively not only nuclear spectra , but also ground state properties , electromagnetic transitions and decays . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , quantitative accurate predictions have not been reached so far , mainly due to the lack of time - reversal symmetry breaking intrinsic states within the existing implementations of the sccm methods . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present an extension of the sccm framework , based on the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) with particle number and triaxial angular momentum projections , that includes cranking intrinsic states . in the numerical applications we use the finite range density dependent gogny interaction ( d1s parametrization  @xcite ) . in the earliest implementations of the sccm method only axially symmetric intrinsic states were considered  @xcite . a major breakthrough towards a better description of the nuclear spectra within the sccm framework was the inclusion of the triaxial degree of freedom  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a further step forward was the first implementation of a sccm method based on a skyrme pseudo - potential for odd nuclei by b. bally who obtained very promising results in describing the benchmark nucleus @xmath4 mg  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the angular momentum projection with the energy density functionals mentioned above is performed after the energy variation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the consideration of only intrinsic wave functions with zero angular momentum content @xmath5 in the the current sccm calculations tends to favor the ground states with respect to other excited states and a stretching in the spectra is usually found with respect to the experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of time - reversal symmetry breaking intrinsic states @xmath6 obtained by the cranking procedure will thus increase the variational space for excited states and will provide a better description of the spectrum . pioneering angular momentum projection of cranking states have been reported with schematic pairing plus quadrupole interactions  @xcite and with skyrme energy density functionals  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , neither configuration -shape- mixing nor , in the case of skyme interactions , pairing correlations , were taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this letter is to present the first results of the extension of the sccm method described in detail in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( and references therein ) , including now time - reversal - symmetry breaking intrinsic states introduced through cranking calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> the starting point is the construction of a set of intrinsic many - body states having different deformations and intrinsic angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> such states , @xmath7 , have the structure of hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) states  @xcite and are found by minimizing the particle number projected hfb energy , i.e. : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the neutron ( proton ) number projection operator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the so - called variation after particle number projection method ( pn - vap )  @xcite . the first term in the r.h.s . of eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ vap_equat ] is the particle number projected energy and the last terms correspond to the constraints on the cranking angular momentum @xmath10 and on the quadrupole deformation of the system @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the lagrange multipliers @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ensure the conditions : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath17-component of the angular momentum operator and @xmath18 with @xmath19 is the @xmath20 component of the quadrupole operator . </S>",
    "<S> the deformation parameters mentioned above are defined as : @xmath21 being @xmath22 the mass number and @xmath23 fm . in the present work we have imposed the parity conservation as a self - consistent symmetry of the intrinsic states : @xmath24 , being @xmath25 the parity operator . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , neither negative parity states nor odd - multipole deformation -such as the octupole- degrees of freedom are explored here . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , these states are invariant under the so - called simplex - x , @xmath26 , and the t - simplex - y , @xmath27 symmetries , being @xmath28 the time - reversal operator . </S>",
    "<S> the last condition is chosen to have real coefficients in the hfb transformation , and the simplex - x symmetry is very suitable to perform cranking calculations ( eq .  [ vap_equat ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the set of operators @xmath29 are the three generators of a subgroup of the more general point group @xmath30  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter has an additional generator , e.g. , the time - reversal operator . </S>",
    "<S> although the use of self - consistent symmetries constrains the inclusion of correlations within the mean - field approach through the spontaneous symmetry - breaking mechanism , they are imposed to reduce the computational burden . in the present case , we will also exploit these self - consistent symmetries to test the performance of the method since they provide non - trivial checks that help to identify possible inconsistencies . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the choice of the collective coordinates @xmath11 divides the possible quadrupole deformations in six sextants , depending on the range of the angle @xmath31  @xcite . as a result , the values of @xmath31 equal to @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 correspond to prolate ( oblate ) axial deformation and they are related by the different orientations of the principal axes of inertia with respect to the @xmath35-axis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath36 , the intrinsic wave functions do not break the time - reversal symmetry and the energy is independent on the orientation of the axes , being all of the sextants completely equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath37 , the energy will depend on the orientation of the principal axes of inertia with respect to the intrinsic rotation axis , in our case , the @xmath17-axis ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ vap_equat ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the intrinsic states are only invariant under the subgroup of the @xmath30 point group mentioned above and the sextants are now symmetric only with respect to the @xmath38 direction .    </S>",
    "<S> we check this symmetry by performing pn - vap calculations in the @xmath39 plane for three values of the cranking angular momentum @xmath36 ( time - reversal symmetry conserving ) , 2 and 4 , selecting the nucleus @xmath0 mg as an example . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](a)-(c ) we show such potential energy surfaces ( pes ) -first term in the r.h.s . of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ vap_equat ] . here </S>",
    "<S> , the intrinsic states were expanded in nine major spherical harmonic oscillator shells and the number of points included in the mesh of each pes is 502 . </S>",
    "<S> we notice first the equivalence between all of the sextants in the case where the time - reversal symmetry is preserved ( @xmath36 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a redundancy is reduced to the half of the plane separated by the @xmath38 axis for @xmath40 and 4 ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](b)-(c ) ) as expected . </S>",
    "<S> we find the absolute minimum of the @xmath36 pes in the spherical point as it is presumed from the neutron magic number @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy grows more rapidly along the oblate directions than in the prolate ones . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , a second minimum -around 1 mev higher- is obtained at axial prolate configurations with @xmath42 . for larger values than @xmath43 the energy increases quickly also along the prolate lines . for @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> the pes resemble the @xmath36 one except for the values along @xmath45 , where the energy is not as favored as in @xmath46 and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the minima of these surfaces appear at such prolate configurations with @xmath42 , as in the @xmath36 case but shifted to higher energy values , around @xmath48 mev and @xmath49 mev for @xmath40 and 4 respectively .     </S>",

    "<S> the intrinsic many - body states , @xmath55 , break also the rotational invariance of the hamiltonian and these quantum numbers can be restored by projecting onto good number of particles ( @xmath56 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath57 ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the component of the angular momentum in the body - fixed @xmath35-axis and the states given in the r.h.s . </S>",
    "<S> are defined as : @xmath60 being @xmath61 the angular momentum projection operator  @xcite . additionally , the coefficients @xmath62 and the projected energies @xmath63 are found variationally by solving the so - called hill - wheeler - griffin ( hwg ) equations in the @xmath64-subspace  @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 labels the possible solutions of such generalized eigenvalue problems and : @xmath67 @xmath68 are the norm and hamiltonian overlaps . from the above definitions , </S>",
    "<S> we can obtain some useful properties of the state @xmath69 such as  @xcite : a ) the probability distribution , @xmath50 , of finding an eigenstate of the angular momentum @xmath70 ; b ) the total probability distribution , @xmath54 , of finding a value of the angular momentum @xmath51 ; and c ) the projected energy @xmath71 . @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath73 @xmath74     as a function of @xmath64 for the intrinsic wave functions ( a ) @xmath52 ( filled symbols ) and ( b ) @xmath53 ( empty symbols ) . </S>",
    "<S> the last column corresponds to the lowest energies for a given @xmath51 after @xmath75 mixing @xmath63 ( eq .  [ hwg_proj ] ) for the same intrinsic states as in ( a ) and ( b ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the decomposition @xmath76 and the energy @xmath77 are quantities that depend on the orientation of the principal axes of inertia with respect to the @xmath78-axes . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the following properties are deduced from the self - consistent symmetries imposed to the intrinsic states : @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and , if @xmath51 is odd , the @xmath81 component is forbidden . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence on @xmath64 is removed once the @xmath64-mixing is performed since the norm @xmath82 and the energy @xmath63 are scalar quantities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , if @xmath36 the same probability distribution @xmath82 and the same angular momentum projected energy are found in the six sextants of the @xmath11 plane . </S>",
    "<S> however , </S>",
    "<S> if the cranking term is non - zero , the @xmath11 plane is split in two equivalent parts divided by the @xmath83 line .    </S>",
    "<S> we now exploit these symmetries to perform consistency tests of the results and check the implementation of the method . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we select first two intrinsic states , @xmath84 and @xmath85 that are symmetric with respect to the @xmath83 line ( see yellow squares in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we represent the decomposition of those states in components of the angular momentum @xmath51 and intrinsic @xmath35-projection @xmath64 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3](a)-(d ) , normalized to the total probability in a given @xmath51 . here </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the decomposition in @xmath64 is different depending on the value of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath86 the probability decreases in general rapidly with increasing @xmath64 for a fixed value of @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the relative weight of the components with large @xmath64 tends to increase with larger angular momentum @xmath51 , while the @xmath81 component for even @xmath51 and @xmath87 components for odd @xmath51 slightly decrease . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with having the intrinsic long inertia axis nearly along the @xmath35-axis . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the probability for a given @xmath51 is distributed in a larger number of @xmath64 components for @xmath88 and these components are much flatter than in the previous case when the angular momentum @xmath51 is increased . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the intrinsic long inertia axis is almost oriented perpendicular to the @xmath35-axis . nevertheless , the decomposition in @xmath51 of both states , summing all of the @xmath64 components , are identical . we observe two separate distributions for even @xmath51 ( fig .  [ figure3](e ) ) and odd @xmath51 ( fig .  [ figure3](f ) ) , being the absolute scale larger for the former . </S>",
    "<S> the even ( odd ) distribution probability increases from @xmath89 ( 1 ) until the maximum at @xmath90 ( 5 ) is reached . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath82 decreases , obtaining practically zero probability for even ( odd ) angular momenta larger than 16 ( 13 ) . in fig .  [ figure4 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we represent the @xmath71 energies defined above . </S>",
    "<S> we see as in the previous case noticeable differences depending on the @xmath31 values . for @xmath86 </S>",
    "<S> the energies rise rather quickly for large values of @xmath64 while for @xmath88 the energies are flatter . </S>",
    "<S> these differences are completely removed when @xmath64-mixing is performed through solving the hwg equations ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hwg_proj ] ) as it is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure4](c ) . there , three bands can be distinguished , namely , a ground state rotational band with @xmath91 built on top of @xmath92 , and two @xmath93 bands , being @xmath94 and @xmath95 the corresponding band - heads .    </S>",
    "<S> we can test even further the performance of the angular momentum projection by projecting the whole @xmath11 plane as it is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](d)-(f ) . for the @xmath36 case , </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence between the six sextants is preserved when angular momentum projection is performed . </S>",
    "<S> however , the angular momentum projected pes attained by restoring the rotational symmetry of the @xmath37 states are symmetric only around the axis @xmath83 ( fig  [ figure2](e)-(f ) ) . in fig  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](d)-(f ) only the pes for @xmath96 are shown although the same equivalence is obtained for other values of @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the symmetries discussed above , the angular momentum projection modifies significantly the surfaces obtained at the pn - vap approach . in general , the minima found in the pes at the pn - vap level are now wider and a slightly larger deformation is obtained whenever the angular momentum is restored . </S>",
    "<S> as a matter of fact , these beyond mean - field correlations move the ground state from the spherical point to prolate configurations with @xmath98 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](d ) ) , that was formerly a secondary minimum in the pn - vap calculation ( fig .  [ figure2](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect was already obtained with axial calculations  @xcite and is a self - consistent way to obtain the deformed ground state for the nucleus @xmath0 mg , i.e. , as belonging to the island of inversion with an erosion of the @xmath41 magic number .    </S>",
    "<S> the last step in the present sccm many - body method is the configuration mixing : @xmath99 again , the coefficients @xmath100 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gcm_state ] , and the final spectrum , @xmath101 , are obtained by solving the general hwg equations : @xmath102 where @xmath103 now encodes all the constraints and @xmath64 in a single index . @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the energy and norm overlaps respectively : @xmath106 @xmath107    mg with the gcm method with 17 axial states and @xmath36 ( @xmath108 ) , 49 axial+triaxial states and @xmath36 ( @xmath109 ) , 81 axial+triaxial states and @xmath110 and 113 axial+triaxial states and @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) excitation energies for the three lowest states for each @xmath51-value , calculated with the gcm method with 113 axial+triaxial states and @xmath111 ( full symbols ) , large scale shell model calculations ( open circles ) and experimental data ( asterisks ) . ]    to shed light on the impact of including time - reversal symmetry breaking states in the spectrum , the nucleus @xmath0 mg has been computed with the gcm method using four sets of intrinsic wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> all of them are computed with nine major oscillator shells ( @xmath112 ) in the working basis   ones already with @xmath113 , thus showing a good convergence of the results with respect to the size of the working basis . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest one ( @xmath108 ) is made of the 17 axial and time - reversal symmetric states . </S>",
    "<S> such states are marked in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](a ) with dots along the @xmath114 axis . </S>",
    "<S> then , the @xmath109 set is defined by adding 32 more time - reversal conserving states @xmath115 in the @xmath11 plane ( the remaining dots in the same figure ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , two more batches of states , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , are established by adding 32 time - reversal symmetry breaking states with @xmath40 , and 32 more with @xmath118 ( see the dots in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath119 , being the total number of states in the largest set equal to 113 .    </S>",
    "<S> the ground state bands calculated with the gcm method implemented with the different sets described above are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure7](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the ground state energies obtained for the different calculations are pretty close except for the pure axial case , namely :    @xmath120 mev for @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> that shows that the ground state energy is converged with respect to adding time - reversal symmetry breaking components . </S>",
    "<S> however , the excited states are more affected by the inclusion of triaxial and cranking states . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we first observe a moderate compression of the spectrum from the axial @xmath121 to triaxial calculations with @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in energy is larger with increasing the angular momentum , mainly due to the possibility of having more @xmath64-mixing in the gcm states . </S>",
    "<S> however , the variational space for the excited states are much better explored if time - reversal symmetry breaking is allowed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a significant compression of the spectrum is obtained for the @xmath116 and @xmath117 sets and the differences , once again , are bigger for larger angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we can infer that the excitation energies for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states are already converged with the @xmath116 calculation since they do not vary significantly from including @xmath118 states to the @xmath110 ones . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case for larger values of the angular momentum , where probably intrinsic states with @xmath122 should be also included in the gcm . for the sake of completeness </S>",
    "<S> , the full spectrum computed with the @xmath117 set is represented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure7](b ) . here , the first two bands display a rotational character , with a parabolic trend in the excitation energies , @xmath123 band - heads and @xmath91 spacing . </S>",
    "<S> a third band starting at @xmath124 with @xmath93 is also obtained , showing a slight odd - even @xmath51 staggering . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , large scale shell model ( lssm ) results  @xcite and experimental data  @xcite are also represented in fig .  [ figure7](b ) . thanks to the compression of the spectrum produced by the addition of cranking states , a remarkable agreement between the experimental and theoretical values for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 energies is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the present sccm calculations predict very similar excitation energies to the lssm values for the g.s . band . </S>",
    "<S> however , the low excitation energy of the @xmath125 state  @xcite is not reproduced here . </S>",
    "<S> lssm calculations have shown that this state is very sensitive to a subtle mixing of spherical 0p-0h and superdeformed 4p-4h configurations  @xcite . in the present framework , </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of pairing fluctuations  @xcite and/or explicit quasiparticle excitations could help to solve this problem since the excited @xmath123 states are mainly affected by such a degree of freedom , lowering the excitation energies of those states .     and @xmath3 excitation energies for the mg isotopic chain calculated with the gcm method including axial states ( red squares ) , axial+triaxial with @xmath36 states ( blue diamonds ) and axial+triaxial with @xmath110 states ( magenta open dots ) . experimental values ( black dots ) </S>",
    "<S> are taken from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein . ]    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we explore systematically the effect of the inclusion of time - reversal symmetry breaking states in the magnesium isotopic chain @xmath126 mg . </S>",
    "<S> the results are obtained with @xmath127 -the minimum that guarantees a good convergence with respect to the size of the basis in this isotopic chain- and the sets of wave functions defined above @xmath128 , i.e. , axial and triaxial shapes with @xmath36 and 2 are included . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure9 ] we plot the excitation energies for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 calculated with these different approaches compared to the experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the axial calculations describe the trends of the experimental data but the energies are largely overestimated . including the triaxial degree of freedom without breaking the time - reversal symmetry </S>",
    "<S> reduces the excitation energies but the predicted values are still too high with respect to the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> finally , adding @xmath40 states to the gcm set of wave functions compresses further the spectrum and an outstanding agreement with the experimental values is found . </S>",
    "<S> the only nucleus where the theoretical values tend to be lower than the experimental ones is the nucleus @xmath129 mg . </S>",
    "<S> since this is a @xmath130 nucleus , some alpha clustering and/or proton - neutron pairing correlations could be missing within the present framework which assumes a structure of the intrinsic states given by a direct product of protons and neutrons wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> however , mixing protons and neutrons to take into account such proton - neutron pairing correlations is beyond the scope of the present study .    in any case </S>",
    "<S> , we have to underline that these results constitute the first explicit evidence of the compression of the spectrum when time - reversal symmetry breaking is taken into account in gcm calculations with particle number and angular momentum projection . </S>",
    "<S> global calculations performed with these methods assuming axial symmetry have displayed a systematic overestimation of the @xmath131 excitation energies around a factor @xmath132 with respect to the experimental values , both for skyrme  @xcite and gogny  @xcite functionals . </S>",
    "<S> the present results show that such a disagreement could be corrected by including triaxial and @xmath37 states in the gcm framework . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the incorporation of @xmath10 in the gcm ansatz ( eq .  [ gcm_state ] ) is a generalization of the double projection method of peierls and thouless  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the double projection method is known to provide the exact translational mass in the case of translations by taking as coordinates the position and the linear velocities in a generator coordinate method . </S>",
    "<S> we expect , therefore , that the moment of inertia of our theory will be similar to the one provided by the angular momentum projection before variation approach , instead of the yoccoz moment of inertia given by the angular momentum projection after variation method used in earlier approaches . </S>",
    "<S> this expectation is confirmed by our results that provide moments of inertia very close to the experimental ones .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented the first gcm calculations with particle number and angular momentum projection of hfb - like states considering different quadrupole deformations ( axial and triaxial ) and intrinsic cranking angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the method has been checked by taking advantage of the self - consistent symmetries imposed to the intrinsic many - body states . since </S>",
    "<S> such wave functions were chosen to be eigenstates of a @xmath30 sub - group generated by the parity , simplex - x and t - simplex - y symmetry operators ( @xmath29 ) , the potential energy surfaces ( particle number and particle number plus angular momentum projected ) must be symmetric in the @xmath11 plane with respect to the @xmath83 axis . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked such a non - trivial property both in individual states and in the whole @xmath11 plane , taking the nucleus @xmath0 mg as an example . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of including incrementally intrinsic states with more symmetries broken in the gcm framework has been also analyzed in @xmath0 mg and in the magnesium isotopic chain @xmath126 mg . </S>",
    "<S> the results have shown that adding ( @xmath37 ) time - reversal symmetry breaking states squeezes notably the spectra due to a better description of the excited states from a variational point of view . </S>",
    "<S> such a compression puts the theoretical values on top of the experimental ones for the lowest @xmath133 and @xmath134 states in the chain . </S>",
    "<S> the next step will be the calculation of electromagnetic properties within the present sccm approach and some work is in progress along these lines . </S>"
