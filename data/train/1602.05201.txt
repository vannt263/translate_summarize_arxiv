    "recent experiments in spin qubit systems demonstrated full single - qubit control via electrical ac driving at microwave frequencies @xcite .",
    "advantages of such an approach include the ability to operate the qubit while staying near a sweet spot where the charge noise is considerably suppressed @xcite while simultaneously filtering out low - frequency noise off - resonance with the driving field .",
    "however , designing an ac control pulse is not necessarily a trivial matter .",
    "there are a variety of approaches for designing pulses with some set of desirable qualities such as speed , finite bandwidth , low fluence , robustness against pulse length errors , etc .",
    "the standard approach in spin qubit experiments is simply to use the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "rwa is rather ubiquitous in a variety of contexts , arising , for example , when a laser is used to couple two atomic states .",
    "when the driving field is near resonance with the transition frequency between the states , rwa gives a straightforward prescription for full control of the two - level system by manipulating the phase and the duration of the ac control pulse . with the exception of extremely intense lasers ,",
    "the amplitude of the ac control field is typically small when compared to the resonant frequency , and is extensively employed in atomic and molecular physics .",
    "however , semiconductor qubits have a much smaller two - level splitting than typical atomic systems and can be operated in a regime where rwa is no longer valid , i.e. , the driving ac field strength is not necessarily much smaller than the qubit energy spacing . in practice ,",
    "semiconductor qubits are often operated with weak driving in order to take advantage of the simplicity of the rwa control design .",
    "however , there is no reason stronger driving could not be used in conjunction with state - of - the - art pulse - shaping or some other control method to perform qubit operations .",
    "in fact , strong driving is attractive for semiconductor qubit operations because it leads to both faster gate operations and less exposure to background noise .",
    "the latter is particularly important at this stage , as large - scale quantum computation requires errors per gate to be below a given threshold for fault - tolerant error correction ( ftec ) @xcite , so one needs gate times substantially shorter than the @xmath1 coherence time .",
    "this threshold is often estimated to be @xmath2 @xcite , and even for more recent surface codes with thresholds of @xmath3 @xcite the massive overhead is greatly reduced if one can reduce errors down to near the @xmath4 level @xcite .",
    "this fact also provides motivation to design gates accurately  even in the absence of any environmental noise , using control pulses based on an rwa analysis in a strong driving regime would obviously introduce completely avoidable deterministic errors ( which would have to be corrected introducing avoidable overhead in the quantum computing operations ) ! the objective of the first part of this work is to quantify the error due to a rwa pulse design by considering realistic experimental situations involving different qubit architectures .",
    "such a quantification in the specific context of spin qubits is very important as a practical guide , and here we provide the necessary analysis .",
    "= 0.9 cm    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it turns out that to achieve faster gating for certain oscillatory driven quantum - dot systems such as the rx @xcite or st qubit @xcite , one can no longer use rwa as a guide for constructing the control pulse . in the second part of this paper",
    "we carry out a numerical analysis of a specific form of control pulse and present the key pulse control parameters for experiments to achieve certain important gates with much higher speed .",
    "we do not search for the shortest possible solution , as in optimal control theory , but instead we catalog all realizations within a simple , highly constrained space .",
    "some elegant optimal control approaches apply to two @xcite and three qubits @xcite , but we consider only single - qubit operations .",
    "other approaches focus on accounting for the rwa resonance shift @xcite , but we wish to keep the entire dynamics , including the rapid counter - oscillating terms .",
    "there are a wealth of pulse - shaping approaches , such as analytical reverse - solving @xcite , multi - parameter optimization schemes such as crab @xcite , and other iterative updating algorithms for pulse sequences such as grape @xcite and krotov s approach @xcite based on optimal control theory . in comparison , our approach focuses on simple sinusoidal pulses with four parameters ( the durations and phases of the two pulses ) , and our theoretical results will serve to guide a straightforward experimental calibration of the control pulses .",
    "optimal control theory or pulse - shaping techniques may well be more desirable for a variety of reasons in a given case .",
    "what we show in the second part of our work , though , is that one can already consider driving in the strongly non - rwa regime with a relatively simple , two - pulse , numerical construction .",
    "we believe that the specificity and the concreteness of our results as well as the simplicity of the proposed pulses make our work of immediate usefulness in the context of faster gate control in various semiconductor qubit experiments going on worldwide .",
    "an overview of this paper is as follows .",
    "the first part of this paper quantifies the deterministic error induced using rwa pulse design in st , rx , as well as spin - charge hybrid @xcite and different single - spin qubit @xcite systems .",
    "both the nominally resonant ( when field frequency equals the two - level splitting ) and nonzero detuning cases are covered .",
    "we find that for the rx qubit @xcite and the resonantly - driven st qubit @xcite , the deterministic rwa - induced errors are already larger than the fault tolerance threshold with the experimentally reported parameters , which grow even larger if the gates are implemented faster in an attempt to reduce random environment - induced errors .",
    "therefore special attention will be paid to these two cases .",
    "however , the analysis applies generally to any strongly driven two - level system , and should be applicable to other qubit systems where fast gate operations are desirable .    following the numerical analysis , we apply higher - order perturbation theory ( two orders beyond the leading order , which is rwa ) on the converted floquet hamiltonian @xcite and obtain an analytical expression for the state - averaged gate infidelity induced by using only an rwa ( i.e. the zeroth - order ) analysis to design gate pulses .",
    "we show that there is an intermediate parameter regime where incorporating higher - order corrections in the gate suppresses the deterministic error by orders of magnitude .",
    "this is quite relevant to the currently on - going st and rx experiments , and could be useful for pulse designs to also reduce random errors , as previously done with piecewise constant pulses @xcite .    in the second part of this work , we go beyond perturbative approaches such as rwa , and solve numerically exactly for pulse control parameters that realize important single - qubit gates for a large range of driving strengths .",
    "this both eliminates deterministic error and increases gate speed , thus indirectly also reducing random error .",
    "our solutions increase the gate speed by more than two orders of magnitude , making our results important for future experiments involving quantum error corrections in semiconductor qubits .",
    "we use a simple pulse sequence with only four parameters .",
    "experimental implementation in the nonideal solid - state environment would proceed by calibrating the pulses in a small region of parameter space near our numerical solution .",
    "the structure for the rest of the paper is as follows ( and we also provide a guidance for the key results ) . section  [ subsec : rwa_sinu_numer ] gives a systematic numerical quantification of the averaged rwa infidelity , with the underlying leading - order effect worked out analytically [ eq .

    "the detailed results and discussions are given in appendix  [ app : shifted_sinu ] .",

    "we can readily modify the coupling model to any experimentally relevant situation and calculate the pulse control parameters for desired logic gates , allowing easy experimental access to fast operations .",
    "our work can also be easily generalized to other qubits where fast operations are desirable ( e.g. superconducting qubits ) .",
    "if desired , semiconductor spin qubits could be operated for faster gate operations in a strong driving regime , far beyond the threshold where rwa gives an accurate description of the dynamics .",
    "the strong driving is indeed very desirable to speed up operations , but the design of gate operations in that regime requires appropriate protocols different from the rwa scheme .",
    "this is particularly true given the stringent precision requirements of fault - tolerant quantum computing . in this work",
    "we have quantified the well - known limitations of rwa for specific spin qubit platforms by carefully analyzing the experimental situations , and also determined the extent to which a perturbative approach can extend the applicability of an analytic approach to gate design .",
    "the analytical approach we developed , which may work when the driving is not too strong ( and hence the gate operations are not very fast ) , is simple and practical to use .",
    "we find that for the resonant - exchange and ac - driven singlet - triplet qubits in particular , a completely new approach is required to circumvent the limitations of rwa .    while one could focus on the aspect of minimizing the gate time through any of the standard pulse - shaping or optimal control techniques , in this work we have instead considered the solutions that exist within a simple , highly constrained space .",
    "this has inherent heuristic value , and the ability to map out the full set of solutions is unusual among numerical optimal control approaches , and may prove useful in informing local searches in the experimental parameter space for non - rwa gating pulses .",
    "our desired gate operation is built from only two applications of a simple sinusoidal pulse .",
    "our complete numerical calculations of the pulse control parameters for the hadamard and @xmath0 logic gates have been plotted as a visual look - up table to synthesizing gates over a wide range of driving amplitudes .",
    "while this means of presentation is necessarily imprecise , any real experimental implementation will have imperfections not included in the theoretical model that will perturb the solutions we have presented anyway .",
    "the true power of our results is that they provide a guide to the on - chip calibration of fast gating operations .    for convenience ,",
    "we provide a quantitative comparison with the ultimate quantum speed limit .",
    "it is emphasized that the optimization of quantum gates or evolution operators [ on @xmath27 , or diffeomorphic to the @xmath196 space ] @xcite are different than that of the state transfer which is only parametrized by two real numbers on the bloch sphere @xcite . in the weak - driving rwa regime , the minimal times to achieve the hadamard and @xmath0 gates are @xmath197 and @xmath198 ( @xmath199 is the bound of the control field ) , respectively , by resorting to pontryagin maximum principle @xcite and minimizing the action @xcite .",

    "thus , this comparison also serves to demonstrate the overall high performance of our scheme despite of its simple design .",

    "as a concrete comparison , the method of ref .",
    "@xcite produces high - fidelity state rotations whose speed is less than the relevant quantum speed limit by a mere 3% by optimizing over 15 parameters and incorporating realistic technical constraints of the pulse generator , while our method produces exact gates whose speed is less than the relevant quantum speed limit by 50% or less by optimizing over only four parameters in an idealized theoretical scenario . we hasten to add , however , that in many ways this is an apples - to - oranges comparison , not least because the quantum speed limits for rotations from a specific input state to a specific output state , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , are different from the speed limits for implementing a state - independent gate operation ( in fact , the latter are not even fully worked out yet @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , this illustrates the point that for a specific goal or cost functional ( i.e. , some combination involving fidelity , time , bandwidth , etc . ) , techniques such as that of scheuer _ et al _ @xcite may offer better performance .",
    "however , the attraction of the pulses we have presented is their theoretically rudimentary form and the ability to map out the entire solution set within the comparatively small parameter space in order to aid calibration .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical study of single - qubit operations by oscillatory fields on various semiconductor platforms . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly show how to perform faster gate operations by going beyond the universally - used rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) regime , while using only two sinusoidal pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we first show for specific published experiments how much error is currently incurred by implementing pulses designed using standard rwa . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that an even modest increase in gate speed would cause problems in using rwa for gate design in the singlet - triplet ( st ) and resonant - exchange ( rx ) qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the extent to which analytically keeping higher orders in the perturbation theory would address the problem . </S>",
    "<S> more strikingly , we give a new prescription for gating with strong coupling far beyond the rwa regime . </S>",
    "<S> we perform numerical calculations for the phases and the durations of two consecutive pulses to realize the key hadamard and @xmath0 gates with coupling strengths up to several times the qubit splitting . working in this manifestly non - rwa regime , </S>",
    "<S> the gate operation speeds up by two to three orders of magnitude and nears the quantum speed limit without requiring complicated pulse shaping or optimal control sequences . </S>"
