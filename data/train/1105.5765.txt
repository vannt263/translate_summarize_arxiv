    "[ sec:1 ] the description and simulation of the transport , especially the turbulence of magnetically confined fusion plasmas in the edge region called scrape off layer ( sol ) of a tokamak , is nowadays one of the main problems for fusion generated energy production ( iter ) .",
    "the understanding of the physics in this edge region is fundamental for the performances of the tokamak , in particular the plasma - wall interactions as well as the occurring turbulence have an important impact on the confinement properties of the plasma . from a numerical point of view ,",
    "an accurate approximation of the plasma evolution in the edge region is essential since energy fluxes as well as particle fluxes at the boundary are used as boundary conditions for the mathematical model applied to describe the plasma evolution in the center region ( core ) of the tokamak .",
    "the physical properties of these two regions ( core / edge ) are rather different , so that different models are used for the respective plasma - evolution modeling : the gyrokinetic approach for the collisionless core - plasma and the fluid approach for the collisional edge - plasma .",
    "+ a large variety of models can be found in literature @xcite for the description of the sol , based on various assumptions and aimed to describe different physical phenomena .",
    "we shall concentrate in this paper on the tokam3d model , introduced in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this model is the investigation of the instabilities occurring in this plasma edge region , as for example the kevin - helmholtz instability , the electron - temperature - gradient ( etg ) , ion - temperature - gradient instabilities ( itg ) , etc .",
    "+ the tokam3d model is based on a two - fluid description ( ions , electrons ) and consists of the usual continuity equation , equation of motion and energy balance equation , closed by the so - called `` braginskii closure '' .",
    "these equations are @xmath0 \\displaystyle m_\\alpha n_\\alpha \\left [ \\partial_t u_\\alpha + ( u_\\alpha \\cdot \\nabla ) u_\\alpha \\right ] = - \\nabla p_\\alpha + n_\\alpha e_\\alpha ( e + u_\\alpha \\times b ) - \\nabla \\cdot \\pi_\\alpha + r_\\alpha\\ , , \\\\[3 mm ] { 3 \\over 2 } n_\\alpha \\left [ \\partial_t t_\\alpha + ( u_\\alpha \\cdot \\nabla ) t_\\alpha \\right ] + p_\\alpha   \\nabla \\cdot u_\\alpha = - \\nabla \\cdot q_\\alpha - \\pi_\\alpha : \\nabla u_\\alpha + q_\\alpha\\ , , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the particle density ( @xmath2 for electrons and @xmath3 for ions ) , @xmath4 the velocity , @xmath5 the particle flux , @xmath6 the particle mass , @xmath7 the particle charge ( @xmath8 for electrons and @xmath9 for ions ) , @xmath10 the pressure , @xmath11 the stress ( viscosity ) tensor , @xmath12 a particle source term ( coming from the core plasma ) , @xmath13 the friction force due to collisions , @xmath14 the temperature , @xmath15 the energy flux and finally @xmath16 the particle exchange energy term , due to collisions . in the braginskii closure ,",
    "the pressure is specified as @xmath17 ( perfect gas assumption ) , the plasma viscosity is supposed negligible , such that @xmath18 and @xmath19 and the energy flux @xmath15 is supposed to have a diffusive form , given in terms of the temperature gradient , as follows @xmath20 ( coming from the fourier law ) with @xmath21 the thermal conductivity coefficient .",
    "the energy exchange term @xmath16 is taken under the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the electron - ion collision time .",
    "+ due to the high complexity of the problem , several other hypothesis are assumed , permitting to concentrate on the desired features and to filter out the insignificant / disturbing details .",
    "these hypothesis , as for example the quasi - neutrality @xmath24 , are not detailed here and we refer the reader to the more physical works @xcite .",
    "+ several difficulties arise when trying to solve numerically the system ( [ eq_mf ] ) .",
    "we shall concentrate in this paper only on the temperature equation , which requires at the moment still a lot of effort , due to its inherent numerical burden .",
    "the resolution of the two other equations was the aim of the phd thesis @xcite .",
    "the numerical difficulties in solving the temperature equation are firstly related to the thermal conductivity coefficients , which depend on the temperature itself , leading thus to a non - linear problem .",
    "secondly , the strong magnetic field which confines the tokamak plasma introduces a sharp anisotropy into the problem .",
    "indeed , the charged particles gyrate around the magnetic field lines , moving thus freely along the field lines , but their dynamics in the perpendicular directions is rather restricted .",
    "quantities as for example the resistivity or the conductivity , differ thus in several orders of magnitude when regarded in the parallel or perpendicular directions .",
    "finally , boundary conditions have to be imposed , which is a rather delicate task from a physical , mathematical and numerical point of view .",
    "+ let us now present in more details the model we are interested in . in this paper , we shall study a simplified version of the temperature evolution equation , which contains however all the numerical difficulties of this last one .",

    "the non - linear boundary conditions at the limiter express the fact , that we have continuity of the heat fluxes at the boundary . indeed , the heat flux @xmath38 at the boundary is given as the sum of a diffusive and a convective term , like @xmath39 at @xmath40 the particle velocity @xmath41 is negative , whereas at @xmath42 we have @xmath43 , which gives rise to the boundary conditions in ( [ bc ] ) .",
