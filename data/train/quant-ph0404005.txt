    "<S> more precisely , the output entropy associated with a pure state measures the entanglement that such a state establishes with the environment during the communication . because the state of the environment is not accessible , this entanglement is responsible for the loss of quantum coherence and hence for the injection of noise into the channel output </S>",
    "<S> . low values of entanglement , i.e. , of @xmath0 , then correspond to low - noise communication . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the study of @xmath0 yields important information about channel capacities . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , an upper bound on the classical capacity derives from a lower bound on the output entropy of multiple channel uses , see , e.g. , @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> additional supporting evidence for the minimum - entropy conjecture appears in our companion paper  @xcite , where we show that the integer - order rnyi entropies and the wehrl entropy at the output of the bosonic channel are minimized when the channel input is a coherent state .    in sec .  </S>",

    "<S> [ s : gauss ] we prove the minimum output entropy conjecture for the restricted scenario in which only gaussian states may be fed into the channel . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s : lb ] we present a collection of lower bounds on @xmath0 . </S>",
