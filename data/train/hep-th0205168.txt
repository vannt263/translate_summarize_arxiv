    "we begin our introduction by quoting the following two lucid remarks by von weizscker @xcite , similar ideas were also entertained by wheeler , see e.g. @xcite and some other people .",
    "the quotations are meant to strike the key of our paper .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  space - time is not the background but a surface aspect of reality  it is extremely improbable that this reality ( i.e. quantum reality ) will be describable as consisting of events which are localized in space and time .",
    "the translocal phase relations are `` surplus information '' not lack of information .",
    "quantum theory knows more , not less , than local classical physics . _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the bulk of the following analysis is concerned with an amalgamation of some important ( mathematical ) ideas of connes about a non - commutative generalisation of the fibration or quotienting - out principle in e.g. topology and , on the other hand , of a line of ideas and concepts we developed in recent years in our approach to quantum gravity .",
    "our analysis results in the observation of the emergence of a translocal component being hidden in the fine structure of our space - time manifold .",
    "we will argue that this translocal substructure has important consequences for a better understanding of the many seemingly non - local features of quantum theory .",
    "we think for example that the famous results of bell ( see @xcite ) are rather an indication that the substructure of quantum theory is necessarily non - local and not ! that the attempts to go beyond the standard interpretation should be abandoned ( as has been also remarked by bohm for several times , see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we will advocate the possibility that quantum theory may emerge as an effective theory from a basically translocal microscopic theory of space - time , its main ingredient being a network of microscopic wormholes .",
    "for that reason we call this class of spaces , we are going to define and investigate , wormhole spaces .",
    "that is , we favor an approach to quantum gravity which considers quantum theory as a coarse grained consequence of the translocal fine structure of microscopic space - time , being the consequence of the peculiar structure of pregeometry underlying our ordinary space - time manifold .",
    "presently there do exist a variety of routes towards a theory of quantum gravity , ranging from frameworks , which depart from a more or less continuous space - time picture , imposing quantum theory more or less unaltered on the underlying classical structure as an independent , quasi god - given scheme , to working philosophies which try to view both quantum theory and gravity as emerging ( low - energy ) effective theories of a more primordial and basically discrete substructure ( with ` discrete ' not necessarily meaning ` countable ' but rather the absence of a priori continuum concepts ) .",
    "a short and very incomplete list of papers advocating such more or less discrete approaches is for example @xcite to @xcite .",
    "our own point of view has been presented in a series of papers in recent years , to which we refer the reader as to more references and a more detailed analysis of the different ideas and concepts being promoted by the various groups sharing this latter working philosophy ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "it goes without saying that it takes a much longer route to arrive at testable consequences if one follows this latter more bottom up oriented avenue and before the results can be compared with results derived by perhaps more immediate top down methods ( which sometimes are openly inspired by certain continuum theories such as classical general relativity ) . in the following",
    "we want to represent such a testable consequence , that is , predicting the existence of a microscopic wormhole structure and discussing some of the possible observable effects .",
    "we mention in particular a certain machian flavor of this finding .",
    "furthermore , while some concepts and/or technical tools are shared to a greater or lesser extent by the various groups working in this field , this does not necessarily mean that also the respective frameworks are more or less identical . to give an example , discrete structures like e.g. ( topological ) graphs occur of course also elsewhere in ( quantum ) gravity research but usually as structures embedded in a preexisting smooth manifold , sharing sometimes even some of the metric properties of the ambient space or derive from certain triangulations , that is , being typically very regular .",
    "in contrast to such scenarios our dynamic graphs are strongly fluctuating irregular dynamical systems ( reflecting in a sense the presumed huge vacuum fluctuations of quantum space - time ) .",
    "smooth continuum structures are only supposed to emerge in a sufficently coarse grained limit which , on the other hand , is only expected to exist provided the underlying microscopic network is in a very peculiar geometrically critical state ( being closely related to the recently found scale - free small world networks ) .",
    "therefore it is perhaps helpful to stress some points which we consider to be characteristic for our own approach .",
    "we represent the primordial substratum as a densely entangled network of elementary relations , interactions or information channels , which is dynamically evolving according to some imposed dynamical law .",
    "we share the wide spread working philosophy that complex and collective behavior can or should emerge from some simple looking basic laws and surmise that our space - time or quantum vacuum is no exception . in this sense",
    "our approach is bottom up , that is , part of our business is it to reconstruct the concepts of modern continuum physics as , so to speak , collective quantities from this primordial substratum ( as to similar ideas cf .",
    "for example the last pages in @xcite or the philosophy expounded in @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "what is however special in our framework is that both the states living on the underlying network and the network architecture itself are dynamically evolving , the two components interacting with each other .",
    "hence the interaction of something like `` geometry '' and `` matter '' , which is playing such a dominant conceptual role in general relativity , is automatically incorporated in nuce in our approach .",
    "insofar it transcends the cellular automaton approach advocated by t hooft .",
    "technically we implement this property by introducing dynamic graphs in which edges can not only reorient themselves under the dynamics but can also be created and deleted ( for the sake of brevity we refer the interested reader to @xcite @xcite or the above cited earlier papers as to the technical definitions and some appropriate evolution laws ) .",
    "we note that in @xcite we showed in particular that , while having a richer structure , our networks are also causal sets .",
    "we avoid however , for the time being , the discussion of the notorious problem of time in quantum gravity ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "that is , purely for ( technical ) convenience we let our network evolve in discrete time steps , which , however , does not imply that physical time is assumed to have the nature of an overall discrete clock time .",
    "our philosophy is rather that ultimately also physical time will turn out to be a collective variable emerging on the more coarse grained levels of our hierarchy of scales of resolution .",
    "we recently came upon the following illuminating remark in @xcite which beautifully characterizes the continuum version of the kind of spaces we are going to develop .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  but if a wormhole can fluctuate out of existence when its entrances are far apart  then , by the principle of microscopic reversibility , the fluctuation into existence of a wormhole having widely separated entrances ought to occur equally readily .",
    "this means that every region of space must , through the quantum principle , be potentially `` close '' to every other region , something that is certainly not obvious from the operator field equations which , like their classical counterparts , are strictly local.it is difficult to imagine any way in which widely separated regions of space can be `` potentially close '' to each other unless space - time itself is embedded in a convoluted way in a higher - dimensional manifold .",
    "additionally , a dynamical agency in that higher - dimensional manifold must exist which can transmit a sense of that closeness .",

    "the concept of locality tells us that sufficiently separated regions are non- or at most weakly interacting on this ( quasi- ) classical level . in a sense ,",
    "such a classical background is considered to be the necessary prerequisite for an effective theory like quantum theory to emerge from a more fundamental theory . on the other hand we will argue in the following , that there exists , in addition to the local structure , an almost hidden additional web of translocal ( cor)relations between widely separated regions of classical space - time , which represent , so to speak , the remnants of this earlier more primordial and much stronger correlated phase ( being prevalent in the big bang era ) .",
    "these ideas will be expounded and corroborated in sections 5 to 7 , the pivotal section being section 6 in which the structure of the critical ( scale free ) network states is rigorously analyzed .",
    "we conclude the paper with a brief discussion of the possible consequences of this peculiar two - level structure of space - time for the translocal features of quantum theory .    in the following the two papers @xcite and @xcite are of particular technical relevance .",
    "in @xcite we developed in quite some detail both the conceptual and the numerical machinery for extracting this mentioned two - level structure from our underlying network .",
    "the framework which makes this possible we called geometric renormalisation or geometric coarse - graining .",
    "its aim is the construction of a non - trivial geometric fixed point which corresponds to our continuous classical space - time and the distillation of the necessary preconditions ( a critical , scale - free non - local geometric network state ) .",
    "these observations immediately lead over to the second paper , @xcite . in it",
    "we connect our findings with seemingly closely related observations made in a , at first glance , quite different context , the so - called small world phenomenon in biological , sociological and other related networks .",
    "it turns out that in both fields we frequently seem to have roughly two kinds of ties or links , local ones in closely knitted friendship neighborhoods and non - local ones among only losely connected acquaintances , each belonging to a local friendship neighborhood of its own , but which , typically , do not overlap with each other.in addition to that , our network displays an even more peculiar further property which we call a wormhole structure .",
    "we start our investigation by elaborating in sections 2 and 3 on some of the ideas of connes , which are later amalgamated with the other line of our analysis in section 7 , the motto being `` points , speaking to each other '' .",
    "we note in particular , that in our approach physical points ( also called lumps by us , cf .",
    "@xcite ) have a rich internal structure .",
    "it is therefore interesting that the limits of the classical point - concept are also clearly felt in pure mathematics , see for example the beautiful essay by cartier , @xcite , who remarks :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  the central problem is that of the points of space  +  the only things that matter are their mutual relationships  +  to a given order the infinitesimals of the immediately higher order appear to be points without structure , until we open the box that they constitute and that reveals infinitesimals of a higher order playing provisionally the role of points . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    while our model systems , when appropriately coarse - grained , can presumably lead to something like classical gravity in a low - energy limit , we say however almost nothing about this important point in the present paper .",
    "we only remark that it is obvious that concepts like curvature , dimension and the like are contained in our approach ( as to dimensional concepts see e.g. @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) .    to give an example , a concept closely related to the notion of curvature , i.e. the relation between the number of points lying in a surface , having a certain fixed distance from a given point and the distance itself , can easily be formulated in our network approach . on the one hand",
    "remember the famous thought experiment of einstein of a rotating reference frame ( leading to the conclusion that space - time is non - euclidean , cf .",
    "@xcite,@xcite or @xcite sect.8.3 ) . on the other hand , we studied such a relation in @xcite or @xcite to introduce the notion of ( fractal ) graph dimensions .",
    "in network or graph theory it is called the distance degree sequence relative to a vertex .",
    "concepts like the above can also be discussed in the more abstract and wider setting of metric spaces ( see the interesting ideas of gromov in @xcite or @xcite).our graphs and networks are natural examples of such ( discrete ) metric spaces . as our graphs and their coarse grained descendants ( lump spaces ) are even geodesic metric spaces , the same will hold for the continuous limit manifold if it exists .",
    "it is then an extremely interesting question under what conditions this limit manifold carries a riemannian metric ( a problem already envisaged by riemann him self !",
    "one of the ideas of connes is to give the interior of points , which , on their side , frequently result from some sort of contraction or identification of subensembles of finer constituents , a non - trivial noncommutative structure .",
    "a large part of modern physics still relies on the ideas of mathematical continuum geometry and point - set topology .",
    "furthermore , in most fields of physics , with the exception of general relativity , space typically occurs as some fixed background structure , not participating in the dynamics of the constituents of matter . but even in general relativity space - time is contrived as a preexisting topological manifold of structureless points which rather play the role of labels of events . in some sense",
    "this is a slightly dubious point of view as no one has ever seen these individual points and without coordinate systems and events it would be hard to tell the individual space - time points from each other anyhow .",
    "this manifold is a dynamic agent in general relativity but not so much as a dynamical system ( as in our approach ) with direct interaction between the constituents , viz , the points .",
    "this interaction is rather mediated by matter - fields and/or the metric tensor or connection fields .",
    "these are considered to be quantities being attached to the points , but the points themselves appear to be unaffected by the dynamics , nor are these fields usually regarded as actually encoding the internal structure of points or their infinitesimal neighborhoods . in this sense",
    "the points of the manifold are ideal elements in a twofold way ( as to a discussion of the notion of ideal concepts see e.g. @xcite and further references there ) .",
    "they neither do act nor are acted upon , they serve only as carriers of fields . relating this field approach to our point of view ; as our ( physical ) points are little densely knitted subunits , they are capable of carrying internal states . from a more macroscopic point of view one may regard these states as being located in the infinitesimal neighborhood of the points of the space - time continuum .",
    "it is then suggestive to view fields at points as encoding in a coarse - grained way the fine structure of the unresolved microscopic lumps .",
    "the same applies to theories of the kaluza - klein type .    while on the physical side , this clean picture is a little bit blurred by the advent of quantum theory , with classical concepts of localized objects and points now becoming slightly obscure , nevertheless , the whole framework is still , cum grano salis , moulded in this universal conceptual form of continuous spaces and local fields living on them .    a concept like interaction between points played also no notable role in classical mathematics ( apart , perhaps , from graphs , to which we come below ) .",
    "however , there exists the widespread concept of identification or quotienting out , that is , with @xmath0 a surjective map @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 two spaces , we can decide to identify the set of points , lying in the preimage of @xmath4 with @xmath5 and , by the same token , the partitioning of @xmath2 by @xmath0 with @xmath3 .",
    "we write @xmath6 the equivalence relation being induced by @xmath0 .",
    "correspondingly we can introduce the quotient space of @xmath2 by @xmath7 if we are given an equivalence relation on @xmath2 .",
    "physically we can equally well view the map as a sorting of the points of @xmath2 by the points of @xmath3 or as imposing a value property on @xmath2 .",
    "ordinarily , the individual points in the respective equivalence classes are then identified , that is , in general the emerging structure becomes poorer or coarser . as stressed by connes ( see the following two sections ) the structure can in fact become so poor and coarse in many relevant cases as to become virtually void and uninteresting ( while , on the other hand , the underlying fine structure may be extremely complicated and far from trivial ) .",
    "it was an important observation of connes that in such extreme situations the fine structure of such leaf- and identification spaces can be more appropriately encoded in a noncommutative structure , living over such spaces ( or rather , certain extensions being associated with such @xmath8 ) .",
    "this is the mathematical aspect . as to physics",
    ", connes in @xcite made the subtle remark as to such identified points , @xmath9 of some initial space @xmath2 : ``  to allow them to ` speak ' to each other '' .",
    "in physical terms , one may interpret this as interaction among the points of a space or manifold .",
    "orbits , leaves and other subset structure , occurring in the construction of quotient spaces , are examples of equivalence relations .",
    "it turns out that , in our approach , this is a too narrow framework . an equivalence relation is a subset , @xmath10 , @xmath2 a certain set , with the following properties called , reflexivity , symmetry and transitivity , respectively , i.e. @xmath11 other types of relations are , for example , adjacency : @xmath12 is symmetric and irreflexive ( @xmath13),partial order : @xmath12 is reflexive , antisymmetric ( @xmath14 ) and transitive and so forth .",
    "in our network approach the type of relations which naturally occur are even more special .",
    "they are generalisations of adjacencies .",
    "our dynamical systems are assumed to live on ( simple ) graphs .",
    "if these graphs are unoriented they define an adjacency , with edges between the vertices denoting the ( symmetric ) relation .",
    "if we take , in addition the dynamical laws into account , our graphs become oriented graphs , with the orientation being ( clock)time dependent .",
    "that is , at each instant of time the edges or the relations happen to be oriented anew so that either @xmath15 or @xmath16 occurs in @xmath17 .",
    "put differently , the type of relations which are also relevant in the following are irreflexive and antisymmetric . at each instant of time and for each vertex",
    "@xmath18 we have a subset @xmath19_{in}$ ] of @xmath2 influencing @xmath18 and a subset @xmath19_{out}$ ] being influenced by @xmath18 , the first set given by edges having @xmath18 as target , the latter set being given by edges having @xmath18 as source .",
    "it is important that , typically , these relations are no longer transitive .    for convenience",
    "we always assume that in the relation @xmath12 every @xmath20 occurs as a possible first entry in @xmath15 , put differently , each @xmath18 is related to at least one other element of @xmath2 . in the directed case",
    "this means that each @xmath18 has at least one outgoing edge .",
    "if the base set @xmath2 is countable , we can represent these relations by ( in general ) non - symmetric adjacency matrices .",
    "labelling the rows and columns by the members of @xmath2 , the corresponding entries in the row belonging to @xmath18 are either @xmath21 if the respective column label belongs to @xmath19_{out}$ ] or @xmath22 else .",
    "correspondingly , the column labelled by @xmath18 has entries with value @xmath21 at the places belonging to @xmath19_{in}$ ] . in this way the wiring structure of the oriented graph can be neatly encoded in a matrix .",
    "a more detailed analysis of properties of such matrices and ( directed ) graphs was made in @xcite .",
    "as perhaps not everybody is familiar with the details of the mathematical constructions we briefly review this topic in the following in our own words .",
    "an important conceptual tool in modern mathematics to construct new spaces from given ones , is the quotient operation , that is , dividing a bigger point set by an equivalence relation .",
    "starting from a set , @xmath2 , and a particular subset , @xmath10 , having the above properties of an equivalence relation we form a new space denoted by @xmath23 , @xmath24 or simply @xmath25 , with points being the equivalence classes , @xmath26 , defined by @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath27    if @xmath2 carries a topology we can endow the new space with the canonical quotient topology , being the finest topology on @xmath25 so that the quotient map @xmath28 is continuous . in other words , a set , @xmath29 is open iff @xmath30 is open in @xmath2 .",
    "typical cases in point are identification or quotient spaces derived from the action of a group , @xmath31 , on @xmath2 , the equivalence classes being the orbits of the group action , i.e. @xmath32 in this case each @xmath33 is assumed to act as a permutation or bijection on @xmath2 , that is , the space @xmath2 is partitioned ( or foliated ; at the moment we do not intend to give the precise definition , see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) into orbits or leaves .",
    "in most of classical mathematics , the quotient spaces being studied typically carry a non - singular ( e.g. hausdorff- ) quotient topology . on the other hand , as strongly emphasized by connes , there do exist lots of interesting ( quotient ) spaces with highly irregular or fragmented orbits , leaves or partitionings .",
    "a consequence may be that the ordinary induced topology is trivial , the only open or closed sets being the total space and the empty set , called the indiscrete or coarse topology .",
    "it follows that the associated function spaces are also trivial , consisting only of constant functions ( in case the space is connected ) .",
    "in other words , the ordinary commutative philosophy , encoding the topology of quotient spaces in the corresponding function algebra over the space ( via the gelfand - isomorphism ) , turns out to be completely insufficient as the space may , nevertheless , have an extremely rich internal structure , which is , to express it in physical terms , no longer resolved by the microscope , given by the associated function algebra .    various paradigmatic examples are discussed in the book of connes ( @xcite ) .",
    "a nice review is also @xcite .",

    "from the above discussion it follows that the functorial identification of ( topological ) spaces and abelian algebras becomes obsolete in these ( not so infrequent ) situations . in the past such spaces",

    "emphasize aspects which will , hopefully , exhibit the relation to our own approach to quantum space - time physics .    to do this , a closer inspection of the arguments and ideas , given by connes in for example the first chapter of @xcite , called `` noncommutative spaces and measure theory '' and in particular the subsection i.4 : `` geometric examples of von - neumann algebras '' , is helpful .",
    "it is important for the following to understand in more detail some of the technical subtleties , underlying the construction of operator algebras on e.g. leaf spaces , given in @xcite .",
    "we will see that , strictly speaking , the `` noncommutative '' construction is actually performed over a particular fiber - bundle with base space @xmath2 and not really over the singular quotient space @xmath25 , which rather plays an intermediary role by supplying the fibers over the points of @xmath2 .",

    "we denote this space by @xmath62 .",
    "it is important to note that this hilbert bundle is a bundle over @xmath2 and that even if @xmath63 belong to the same fiber , i.e. @xmath58 , the hilbert vectors in @xmath64 can be independently chosen , that is , @xmath65 in general . consequently , this structure alone does not yet reflect the true leaf structure of @xmath25 .",
    "on the other hand , the above amplification construction is technically necessary due to the , in general , degenerated structure of @xmath25 .",
    "the leaf structure will be encoded in the operator algebra constructed below .",
    "it was realized by connes that we can both get an interesting mathematical structure and a characterisation of the underlying singular leaf space by now taking the natural operator algebras or matrix algebras of bounded operators on @xmath50 leafwise , that is , we define an operator valued function , @xmath66 , over @xmath2 with the proviso @xmath67 with @xmath68 a bounded operator in @xmath69 .",

    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "we now see that these random operators or the corresponding von - neumann algebra characterizes the leaf structure in a particular noncommutative way .",
    "in section [ points ] we argued in favor of a framework which implements the interaction among the points of a manifold and that this is , on the other hand , inherent in some of the ideas of connes .",
    "the model system we start from is a dynamic discrete graph or network assumed to emulate crucial aspects of ( quantum ) space - time on the planck scale . with the help of a coarse - graining or geometric renormalisation process ( @xcite )",
    "we undertake to construct a macroscopic fixed point representing our continuous space - time on the macroscopic or mesoscopic level .",
    "but in contrast to the ordinary continuum employed in classical mathematics or physics , which is assumed to behave in a purely local way , in our approach , the continuum limit develops quasi automatically ( brought to light by the renormalisation construction ) an intricate and largely hidden extra ( non - local ) structure among its points .    for notational convenience",
    "we only introduce some notation in the following and refer the interested reader to @xcite or @xcite for more technical details .",
    "[ graph1]a simple , countable , labelled , ( un)directed graph , @xmath31 , consists of a ( countable ) set of nodes or vertices , @xmath42 , and a set of edges or bonds , @xmath75 , each edge connecting two of the nodes . for convenience there exist no multiple edges ( i.e. edges , connecting the same pair of nodes ) or elementary loops ( a bond , starting and ending at the same node ) .",
    "in this situation the bonds can be described by giving the corresponding set of ( un)ordered pairs of nodes .",
    "the members of @xmath42 are denoted by @xmath76 , the bonds by @xmath77 , connecting the nodes @xmath76 and @xmath78 .",
    "remark : the assumption of a countable vertex set is only made for technical convenience .",
    "we could also admit a non - countable vertex set . from a physical point of view one may argue that the continuum or uncountable sets are idealisations , anyhow .",
    "we note that graphs carry a natural structure which can be employed to emulate the interaction between the nodes or points.this becomes more apparent if we impose dynamical network laws on these graphs such that they become discrete dynamical systems .",
    "henceforth we denote such a dynamical network , which is supposed to underly our continuous space - time manifold , by @xmath74 ( `` quantum space '' ) .",
    "we omit a more detailed discussion of the dynamical evolution of states on graphs or networks , which can be found in our above mentioned papers as we want to concentrate primarily on the emergent non - local aspects of our model systems .",
    "we only want to emphasize the following point .",
    "it is important that in our approach the bond states are also dynamical degrees of freedom which , a fortiori , can be switched off or on .",
    "therefore the wiring , that is , the pure geometry ( of relations ) of the network changes constantly and is hence also an emergent , dynamical property , not given in advance in form of some static background geometry .",
    "furthermore , in the network laws we have studied so far , the individual edges carry states which can take the values @xmath79 and which are naturally associated , via the dynamical law , with the two possible orientations of the edge or its silent , inactive state respectively ( in the graph framework the edge is simply considered to be temporarily absent if the edge state is zero ) .",
    "these local states are updated after every clock - time step ( depending on the state of the nodes in the local environment ) .",
    "+ remark : one sees from this that our cellular networks are generalisations of the more common but also geometrically more rigid cellular automata .",
    "consequently , the nodes and bonds are typically not arranged in a more or less regular array , a lattice say , with a fixed near-/far - order .",
    "it is remarkable that similar ideas have also been entertained in the theory of cellular automata , where systems have been studied which selforganize , in a dynamical process , their lattice structure ( see the beautiful book of ilachynski , @xcite ) .",
    "as we are dealing with very large graphs , which are , a fortiori , constantly changing their shape , that is , their distribution of active bonds , we make the assumption that the dynamics is sufficiently stochastic so that a point of view may be appropriate , which reminds of the working philosophy of statistical mechanics .    it was recently argued ( @xcite and further literature cited there ) that the random graph framework may be too narrow to fully reproduce the observed near- , far - order of so - called scale - free small world networks which seem to be the crucial prerequisites for the emergence of a non - trivial critical continuum fixed point of our coarse graining process .",
    "but nevertheless the random graph picture is still the natural starting point and the basis of a perhaps more advanced theory .",
    "visualizing the characteristics and patterns being prevalent in large and `` typical '' graphs was already a notorious problem in combinatorial graph theory and led to the invention of the random graph framework ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the guiding idea is to deal with graphs of a certain type in a probabilistic sense , that is , forming a probability space with elementary events certain graphs .",
    "this turns out to be particularly fruitful as many graph characteristics ( or their absence ) tend to occur with almost certainty in a probabilistic sense ( as has been first observed by erds and rnyi ) . in the following we are dealing with random graphs living over a fixed node set , having the independent edge probability @xmath80 .",
    "the probability that a particular graph , @xmath81 , with @xmath82 edges occurs is thus @xmath83 with @xmath84 the number of nodes , the maximal possible number of edges respectively .",
    "the standard source is @xcite .    in the above papers ( in particular in @xcite ) we mainly concentrated on properties of so - called cliques , their statistical distribution ( with respect to their order , @xmath85 , i.e. number of vertices ) , degree of mutual overlap etc .",
    "we then studied these properties in the consecutive stages and phases of our renormalisation process , being associated to the various levels of magnification or resolution of our space - time manifold .    with @xmath31 a given fixed graph and @xmath86 a subset of its vertex set @xmath42 , the corresponding _ induced subgraph _ over @xmath86",
    "is called a subsimplex or _",
    "complete subgraph _",
    ", if all its internal pairs of nodes are connected by a bond . in this",
    "partially ordered set there exist certain _ maximal subsimplices _ , that is , every addition of another node ( together with the respective existing bonds to other nodes of the subset ) destroys this property .",
    "these maximal simplices are called _ cliques _ in combinatorics and are the candidates for our _ physical proto - points_. henceforth we denote them by @xmath87 .    for the underlying reason why we concentrated on this particular graph characteristic we provided some motivation in the above cited papers . to put it briefly",
    ", we will associate these cliques with the nested structure of lumps ( or physical points ) making up our ordinary space - time .",
    "that is , the cliques are assumed to look like ordinary points under low magnification but show their internal ( infinitesimal ) nested structure under sufficiently high resolution ( cf .",
    "the remarks by cartier cited in the introduction ) . in @xcite we related these ideas to astonishingly similar ideas in a , at first glance , quite unrelated field where the local lumps are called friendship neighborhoods or clumps and the non - local ties aquaintances",
    ".    we can introduce various random function on the above probability space .",
    "for each subset @xmath88 of order @xmath85 we define the following random variable : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the corresponding induced subgraph over @xmath86 in @xmath91 ( the probability space ) .",
    "another random variable is then the number of @xmath85-simplices occurring in a given @xmath31 , denoted by @xmath92 and we have : @xmath93 with @xmath94 the number of @xmath85-subsets @xmath88 . with respect to the probability measure introduced above we have for the expectation values : @xmath95 and @xmath96    for @xmath97 , the _ expected number of @xmath85-cliques _",
    "( i.e. maximal !",
    "@xmath85-simplices ) in the random graph , we have then the following relation @xmath98    this quantity , as a function of @xmath85 ( the order of the subsimplices ) has quite a peculiar numerical behavior .",
    "we are interested in the typical order of cliques occurring in a generic random graph ( where typical is understood in a probabilistic sense .",
    "the maximal order of occurring cliques contained in @xmath31 is called its _ clique number _ , @xmath99 .",
    "it is another random variable on the probability space @xmath100 .",
    "it is remarkable that this value is very sharply defined in a typical random graph . using the above formula for @xmath101 , we can give an approximative value , @xmath102 , for its expectation value and get @xmath103 ( cf .",
    "xi.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "it holds that practically all the occurring cliques fall in the interval @xmath104 ( for a quantitative and numerical discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that the random graph picture will reproduce at least the qualitative behavior of such extremely complex dynamical systems , being well aware of the possible limitations and necessary generalisation of this picture ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now are going to set up the connection between the two fields discussed in the preceding sections .",
    "that is , on the one hand , the concept of nasty ( quotient ) spaces having very erratic and in some cases dense orbits , leaves etc . , and , on the other hand , our hierarchy of cellular networks or dynamic graphs , which emerges from a certain kind of geometric renormalisation group . as the construction of this nested structure of lumps within lumps",
    "was discussed in quite some detail in @xcite and the emergence of the small world effect in @xcite we can be relatively brief .    the idea to construct a macroscopic ( quasi ) continuum from an underlying more erratic and discrete primordial substratum via some sort of coarse graining is , as we think , not unnatural ( see in particular @xcite and our discussion of earlier work by menger et al about random metric spaces ) .",
    "these considerations led to our concept of a geometric renormalisation group .",
    "we start with a graph , @xmath31 , and , in a first step , pick up its cliques promotingt them to the ( meta ) nodes of a coarser graph , the so - called clique graph , @xmath105 .",
    "if these cliques are not too small , it should make a physical difference whether two selected cliques have an appreciable overlap of common nodes , if this overlap is only marginal ( very few common nodes ) or even empty .    in @xcite realistic numerical examples",
    "were studied in which the typical clique size was roughly of order @xmath106 .",
    "the random graph framework allowed to calculate the probability distribution of expected clique overlaps and related graph characteristics .",
    "the quantitative calculations are however relatively tricky and involved . in the case of a strong overlap",
    "the interaction between the respective cliques is more intensive while in the latter cases it is weak and/or indirect , that is , the internal state of the other clique is only feebly felt if the interaction is weak .",
    "it is the merit of the renormalisation group that it clearly separates these two different kinds of interaction after several coarse graining or renormalisation steps .",
    "our above described procedure suggests the physical assumption that classical macroscopic behavior is hoped to emerge if we neglect the fine details on small scales ( e.g. fluctuations ) .",
    "that is , we only will draw a link between two cliques or lumps , @xmath107 , if the common overlap is non - marginal compared to the typical order of the cliques on the respective renormalisation level . the graph , thus constructed , we call the purified clique graph relative to @xmath31 . to put it more succinctly :    * starting from a given fixed graph , @xmath31 ,",
    "pick the ( generic ) cliques , @xmath87 , in @xmath31 , i.e. the subgraphs , forming maximal subsimplices or cliques in @xmath31 with their order lying in the above mentioned interval , @xmath104 . *",
    "these cliques form the new nodes of the clique - graph , @xmath105 of @xmath31.new bonds in the clique graph are drawn between cliques provided they have a sufficient overlap .    the random graph framework shows the highly non - trivial fact that practically all occurring cliques have a number of nodes lying in the above interval , that is , have a typical size .",
    "we repeat this process of going from a graph to its purified clique graph sufficiently many times until we arrive at a ( quasi-)continuous manifold , emerging as a fixed point of our renormalisation process ( and being reflected by the emergence of a quasi - static regime in which the graph structure do no longer change appreciably in the consecutive coarse - graining steps ) .",
    "such a macroscopic fixed point can however only expected to emerge provided the original network has been in a very peculiar , i.e. , ( quasi-)critical state as has been described in section 8 of @xcite .    on each level of coarse - graining",
    ", that is , after each renormalisation step , labelled by @xmath108 , we get , as in the block spin approach to critical phenomena , a new level set of cliques or lumps,@xmath109 , ( @xmath110 labelling the cliques on renormalisation level @xmath111 ) , consisting on their sides of @xmath112-cliques which are the @xmath111-nodes of level @xmath111 , starting from the level @xmath113 with @xmath114 . that is , we have @xmath115 ( @xmath116 denoting the @xmath112-cliques , belonging , as meta nodes , to the @xmath111-clique , @xmath117 ) .",
    "these cliques form the meta nodes in the next step .",
    "the cliques , @xmath118 , of @xmath114 are called zero - cliques .",
    "they become the one - nodes , @xmath119 , of level one , i.e. of @xmath120 .",
    "the one - cliques , @xmath121 , are the cliques in @xmath120 .",
    "they become the 2-nodes , @xmath122 , of @xmath123 etc .",
    "correspondingly , we label the other structural elements , for example , 1-edges , 2-edges or the distance functions , @xmath124 .",
    "these higher - level nodes and edges are also called meta - nodes , -edges , respectively .",
    "if we collapse these new cliques to meta - nodes we do no longer see their internal structure . if , on the other hand , we decide to keep track of their internal organisation ( cf . also the remarks of cartier in the introduction ) we have the following ( russian doll like ) picture ( where for the sake of graphical clarity the mutual overlaps of the occurring cliques of the same level are not represented ) .",
    "each intermediate graph or array of lumps , @xmath125 , carries a certain geometric and metrical structure of its own .",
    "we can define a metric , @xmath126 on @xmath125 ( there exist in fact several possibilities ) as follows .",
    "we can either use the canonical graph metric ( distance of nodes measured by the minimal number of edges connecting them ) or use a more refined metric which incorporates the varying possible degrees of overlap of cliques ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129/[a\\vee b]\\ ] ] ( @xmath130 denoting intersection and union of sets ) .",
    "the above definition is understood as the infimum over the class of paths,@xmath131 , connecting the two meta nodes in the respective graph of @xmath111-cliques .",

    "concerning the importance of a true coarse - graining including an appropriate purification , the following rigorous result is instructive .",
    "the picture frequently invoked ( space - time foam ) is the following . on a very primordial scale we have a very erratic space - time structure having not even a stable integer dimension ( rather being of a fractal type ) .",
    "smoothing and/or coarse - graining may ultimately lead to a a smooth continuous space - time manifold as we know it .",
    "in @xcite we introduced the concept of ( internal ) dimension of a graph or network .",
    "we later learned that it is also called the distance degree sequence in graph theory ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the above paper we motivated why it should rightly be regarded as a kind of dimension and why it is an important graph characteristic .    to put it briefly , dimension mostly enters physical models via the asymptotic scaling of the number of degrees of freedom which can be reached after a certain number of steps starting from a fixed reference point .",
    "this is implemented in the following definition .",
    "let @xmath18 be an arbitrary node of @xmath31 .",

    "it is of course sufficient to have very large graphs .",
    "note that a similar attitude is frequently adopted in the theory blockspin renormalisation , where , if one works with large but finite systems , the system would shrink after every step by a certain factor .",
    "this is compensated by a rescaling of the system .",
    "if in the preceding construction we decide not to suppress weak ( marginal ) overlaps , that is , to use the unpurified ordinary clique graph , @xmath143 , we have the following remarkable result ( @xcite ) .    assuming that @xmath31 has dimension @xmath144 and globally bounded node degree we have @xmath145 .",
    "that is , the dimension does not change when going from a graph to its non - purified ordinary clique graph .",
    "this observation reminds one of a similar behavior of the ( uncoarse - grained ) entropy functional in statistical mechanics which is a constant of motion as the corresponding measure is invariant under time evolution .",
    "only the coarse - grained entropy happens to increase in a non - equilibrium state .",
    "further even more surprising results can be found in the following section .",
    "we now briefly indicate how one may construct a continuous space from extracting information from our scale of networks or lump spaces .",

    "we discussed such geometric constructions in much more detail in @xcite , employing , among other things , fuzzy geometric methods .",
    "as depicted in the preceding picture , we endow these geometric lumps with the same nested structure as the lumps or cliques of our coarse grained graphs , i.e. @xmath147-cliques containing @xmath148-cliques and so forth down to the initial nodes and bonds . in the different context of loop quantum gravity",
    "similar constructions are discussed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore we want to mention an interesting discussion of a hierarchy of limits of measurability in @xcite .    in making this association ,",
    "it becomes obvious that there may arise spatial obstructions or frustrations in case the different links occurring in the graph @xmath146 can not be implemented geometrically by an appropriate packing of overlapping balls in a @xmath144 dimensional continuum . a more rigid implementation is via simplicial complexes .",
    "this would be a more traditional method in which contact is mediated by having a common face .",
    "put differently , it is not an automatic property that the packing of these lumps fits into some quasi smooth manifold - like structure .",
    "certain crucial properties like a scale free geometric long range order have to be fulfilled , see the next section or section iv of @xcite or @xcite as to a more detailed analysis of critical network states .",
    "a last remark concerns the relation of the metrics or distance functions in the two scenarios .",
    "as described above we have a couple of natural metrics on our ( clique ) graph at our disposal , either discrete ones or randomized or smooth ones .",
    "if one wants to relate such a grainy distance function to a truely continuous version in some final smooth space strict isometry of mappings between metric spaces is certainly not the most natural concept .",

    "@xmath154    with @xmath155 the number of nodes in the graph , @xmath31 , @xmath156 the number of generic cliques in the corresponding clique graph , @xmath147 the assumed sufficient degree of overlap of the generic cliques , @xmath157 some appropriate value lying in the interval @xmath158 $ ] , @xmath159 being assumed ( where the second @xmath160 is not so pronounced as the first one ; @xmath155 is usually gigantic compared to the typical clique size @xmath157 ! ) .",
    "both @xmath156 and @xmath155 are typically quite large in our model examples .",
    "if @xmath102 is not too small , @xmath147 has to be chosen larger than @xmath21 .",
    "we conclude that in this regime most of the cliques have zero or only marginal overlap with a given clique , @xmath153 .",
    "that is , most of the edges , occurring in the unpurified clique graph , have to be deleted or , in other words , are only weak links ( see below ) .",
    "hence , already after a single coarse - graining step , most of the fine structure happens to be smoothed out .",
    "we therefore have the situation that , with @xmath161 , or @xmath162 not too small , between two arbitrary non - overlapping cliques , @xmath107 , there will nevertheless usually exist links ( of the preceding level ) , connecting individual nodes lying in @xmath107 respectivly .    under",
    "the above assumptions there exist usually an appreciable number of nodes , @xmath47 lying in @xmath107 respectively , such that @xmath163 or , more generally , @xmath164 small , while @xmath165 may be large in the purified clique graph @xmath105 .",
    "this process of coarse graining is repeated up to the level , @xmath147 , which is assumed to be sufficiently near to the macroscopic continuum . on every step we observe this phenomenon of the existence of two types of links between lumps or cliques .",
    "we thus get in the end a complicated nested hierarchical structure of different types of links between the final infinitesimal neighborhoods on the macroscopic level and coming from all the levels below the final level , @xmath147 .",
    "remember in particular , that , by construction , nodes on a level @xmath111 with @xmath166 represent full cliques on the preceding level @xmath112 , and by the same token , edges on level @xmath111 are given by non - marginal overlaps of cliques on the preceding level .",
    "what we have described above is the two - level ( or , rather , multi - level ) structure of macroscopic space - time we alluded to in the introduction , that is , a continuous , locally behaving macroscopic space - time manifold , @xmath167 , and an immersed web , @xmath168 , of translocal ( weak ) links , representing , so to speak , _ short cuts _ between more distant regions of @xmath167 .",
    "thinking of the picture of quotient spaces and equivalence relations , discussed in preceding sections , we dubbed this compound structure @xmath169 ( @xmath74 standing for ` quantum space ' and @xmath170 for macroscopic space - time ) in our earlier papers .    in the following figures we try to make this complicated and layered structure among the nodes and cliques a little bit more transparent .",
    "we draw , for example , two non - overlapping cliques , @xmath171 , together with some members of their local groups .",
    "the euclidean distance in the picture is meant to indicate their large relative distance in @xmath105 .",
    "we assume that two nodes , @xmath63 , lying in @xmath171 respectively , are connected by a link belonging to @xmath31 .",
    "in any general clique graph we have this difference between weak and strong links .",
    "if our graph is a fortiori a sufficiently typical random graph this structure is even a little bit more particular as we learned above that in a typical random graph practically all cliques are almost of the same size ( their order lying in the interval @xmath172 ) .",
    "that is , each weak link belongs actually to at least one other clique of practically the same order .",
    "this last property may be different in graphs , having a more pronounced near- and far - order as discussed in @xcite and further literature given there .    in our illustration    the pointed lines plus",
    "the arrow mean that the points @xmath63 , occurring twice , have to be identified and the corresponding lines to be contracted .",
    "that is , the third clique has actually a common node both with @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "a connection via an intermediate clique is one possibility .",
    "the following picture describes a direct ( weak ) contact of @xmath173 and @xmath174 via a single common node @xmath18 .    up to now we arrived at our conclusions concerning the translocal structure of our coarse - grained macroscopic limit networks mainly with the help of the random graph framework plus certain consequences of the geometric renormalisation process .",
    "we will now amend these observations with some precise results which almost rigorously show that these limit networks have to be of a critical scale - free small world type .",
    "one of our main conceptual tools will be the behavior of the dimension of a network under coarse - graining .",
    "we showed in the preceding section that coarse - graining is absolutely necessary if we want to change or reduce the presumably ( fractal ) dimension of the initial network on the primordial planck scale .",
    "as a corollary of the above theorem we have :    for the purified clique graph ( in contrast to the unpurified one ) , we have @xmath175    one may be inclined to surmise that generically we will have @xmath176 , but this is not true !",
    "quite to the contrary , it turns out to be very tricky to really reduce the dimension .",
    "local alterations of the wiring diagram will not do .",
    "analysing the situation in which a dimensional reduction can actually take place leads to the concept of critical network states .",
    "we approach the problem of dimensional reduction by smoothing in two steps .",
    "we learned that @xmath177 that is , it is sufficient to controll the step from @xmath143 to @xmath105 .",
    "this transition consists in the deletion of a a certain fraction of ( weak ) links .    in @xcite ,",
    "4.1 we proved an interesting theorem which shows that the local insertion of arbitrarily many additional edges does not change the dimension of a graph . more precisely :    additional insertions of bonds between arbitrarily many nodes , @xmath178 , having original graph distance , @xmath179 arbitrary but fixed , do not change @xmath180 or @xmath181 .",
    "whereas edge deletion is not simply the dual operation of edge insertion , we can generalize the above result in a way appropriate for our problem .",
    "what we need is a generalisation of the notion local .    both @xmath143 and",
    "@xmath105 carry their own natural graph metrics , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , given by the geodesic edge path distance .",
    "we assume that we pass over from a graph g to a new graph @xmath184 , living on the same node set , by means of a number of edge deletions .",
    "these edge deletions are called local of order @xmath185 if only edges between nodes , @xmath63 , are deleted which have a final distance in @xmath184 globally bounded by @xmath186 .",
    "we then have the remarkable theorem :    if the edge deletions in going from @xmath143 to @xmath105 are uniformly local of an arbitrary but finite order , the dimension does not change , i.e. @xmath187    proof : this can be proven by reversing the proof of the above cited proposition , i.e. we envisage the dual process of going from @xmath105 to @xmath143 by edge insertions , which are now , by assumption , local of a certain finite order .",
    "from our proposition we now can infer that the dimension remains unchanged.@xmath188    in order to change the dimension by edge deletions ( in an infinite graph ; see the remarks after definition 5.3 ) it is therefore necessary ( but not sufficient ; there are counter examples ! ) that there exist infinitely many edge deletions with their degree of locality not being boundable by any given number k. put differently , for any given k there exist infinitely many edge deletions between nodes with final distance greater than k.    we view this kind of scale - free behavior of the occurrence of long - distance weak links as a rigorous formulation of the critical scale - free network states mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we want to complement these general results with an illustrative example , which shows all the features we mentioned above .",
    "we emphasize however that it is not meant as an example of a limit state of a true proto space - time of the kind we have discussed in the preceding sections .",
    "it is only a toy model ! in a first step we embed the one - dimensional line of integers , @xmath189 , in the two - dimensional lattice , @xmath190 , in the way depicted in the following figure .",
    "we regard this ambient lattice as the unpurified clique graph , @xmath143 , of a certain coarse - graining level , with the nodes being cliques .",
    "strong links , given by a sufficient overlap , are denoted by bold lines , weak bonds , which have to be deleted when going from @xmath143 to the purified clique graph , @xmath105 , by dashed lines .",
    "we now see that @xmath143 has graph dimension two while @xmath105 has dimension one .",
    "we learned from our previous rigorous results that such a change can only occur if @xmath143 is in a very peculiar critical state .",
    "inspecting our toy model we see that exactly this is the case ( what is actually peculiar is the embedding of @xmath189 in @xmath191 ) .",
    "node distance in @xmath105 is measured by the canonical metric of @xmath189 , while the metric in @xmath143 is the one coming from @xmath190 .",
    "we see that the bond deletion process really violates the locality assumption for any given @xmath186 . for",
    "any given @xmath186 there exist an infinity of weak links ( to be deleted ) , connecting nodes having a distance larger than @xmath186 .",
    "take for example the following sequence of weak links ( ordered by increasing node distance ) @xmath192 where the numbers denote the position of the nodes with respect to @xmath189 .",
    "in the first sections of the present paper we discussed a general point of view concerning a wider conception of continuous spaces , being of possible relevance for ( quantum ) space - time physics .",
    "we then discussed the subject from a different angle , i.e. , as dynamical , densely entangled networks of relations among microscopic constituents , being depicted by nodes , the relations or elementary interactions by edges .",
    "if we perform a sequence of specific coarse - graining steps on this network , which , under certain conditions , will finally converge to a smooth macroscopic space or space - time , a detailed analysis shows the following . with the help of the random graph concept",
    "we observe the quasi automatic emergence of a new and subliminal web of translocal interactions , being immersed in this classical manifold , @xmath167 . in the following subsections",
    "we want to give a brief account of the sort of continuous model spaces we expect to emerge from this construction , that is , ordinary continous spaces with an embedded web of translocal short cuts .",
    "we introduce these spaces in a quasi axiomatic way as it may sometimes be easier to start right away from these models , if one wants to work out the consequences for continuum physics ( like , for example ordinary quantum theory ) instead of going the long way beginning at the planck scale .",
    "confer also the illuminating remarks by dewitt cited in the introduction .",
    "we conclude that these spaces which , presumably , emerge in quantum space - time physics , support two modes ( or rather a whole hierarchy ) of interactions and/or information exchange among their constituents . a local one , obeying the `` nahwirkungsprinzip '' ( no action at a distance ) , propagating from ( physical ) points ( or lumps ) to their infinitesimal neighbors and so on , and , on the other hand , a translocal almost quasi - instantaneous ( but presumably feeble ) interaction with arbitrarily distant regions of the manifold @xmath167 of a more stochastic type .",
    "this presumed more irregular and stochastic behavior is a result of the weak contact ( via the weak links ) between individual nodes in the various lumps making up the physical points being translocally related in contrast to the more robust interaction ( strong local links ) given by a more intense overlap of full cliques or lumps as is the case in the infinitesimal neighborhood or ( in the clique or lump language ) in the local group .",
    "one can study this different behavior when imposing a dynamical microscopic law as we discussed it in previous papers .",
    "one usually observes large individual fluctuations at individual nodes or along individual links of the primordial level which are then smoothed and averaged out over full cliques or clusters of cliques on the higher levels of the network .",
    "this is now the place where our line of argumentation returns to the point we departed from , that is , the picture of `` points talking to each other '' , which we invoked in the first sections .    to begin with",
    ", the implementation of our findings by means of a continuum description is surely not unique ! from a mathematical point of view a whole class of spaces ,",
    "all sharing certain basic characteristics , can be invented .",
    "so we begin by introducing some models which do not yet share all the features we expect from our renormalisation group analysis .",
    "we start with some continuous space , @xmath167 , like e.g. @xmath193 , or a manifold , being locally homeomorphic to some @xmath193 .",
    "we assume that in @xmath167 a countable but dense subset , @xmath2 , or , alternatively , a partition of non - overlapping , countable and dense subsets , @xmath194 , is specified :    * @xmath2 or @xmath194 are countable and dense in @xmath167 ( note that they do not contain interior points with respect to the topology of @xmath167 ) .",
    "* @xmath194 do not overlap and @xmath195 . in another model situation",
    "we may assume that the @xmath194 are not dense with @xmath196 but dense in @xmath167 .",
    "the above assumptions describe slightly different models and there certainly do exist more model systems of this kind .",
    "we surmise however that , on a more macroscopic scale , the correct choice is perhaps not really crucial .",
    "central is the idea that these delocalized sets should somehow be meager compared to the full continuum , that is , they should have lebesgue measure zero . on the other hand , sets of the fractal type ( cantor dust )",
    "may be admissible .    as we invoked in previous sections the renormalisation group picture ,",
    "the phenomenon called universality comes to mind .",
    "there may in fact exist different microscopic model systems all converging to the same coarse grained macroscopic fixed point provided that they share certain crucial characteristics , determining the whole class . in our case",
    "this is the particular kind of non - local entanglement .    in the ` foliation - model ' ( alluding to a situation similar to the non - commutative torus , discussed above ) , i.e. all @xmath194 dense in @xmath167 but non - overlapping",
    ", we encounter the following situation . every point of",
    "@xmath167 belongs to exactly one of the subsets , @xmath197 .",
    "each of these subsets is spread over the whole manifold @xmath167 and we have in particular that for each neighborhood , @xmath198 , of some point , @xmath199 @xmath200    the above partition defines an equivalence relation @xmath201 with members @xmath15 so that @xmath202 with @xmath26 the set @xmath197 , @xmath18 is belonging to . as in the introductory sections , we can define a bundle structure , @xmath203 , with base space @xmath167 and fibers @xmath45 and proceed in the same way as above by e.g. introducing the local hilbert spaces , @xmath69 which are attached as fibers , @xmath204 to the members , @xmath5 , of the equivalence class . correspondingly , we can introduce random operators acting in these local hilbert space fibers .    as in connes approach we see , that the natural structure is not really some kind of quotient space but rather an amplification of the original space , @xmath167 , to a fiber space over @xmath167 .",
    "the internal spaces describe the subset of points which `` can speak to each other '' in a translocal way .",
    "these subsets are the classes of points of @xmath167 , which happen to be connected by weak links in the underlying network , as has been descibed in the preceding section .",
    "we already remarked in section 2 that the final continuum structure , expected to emerge from our primordial dynamical network , may be more special what concerns the embedded translocal web than a simple equivalence relation ( see also @xcite and , in particular the section about networks as causal sets ) .",
    "as in the dynamical laws , employed by us , the edges typically carry states labelled by @xmath205 being associated with the two possible orientations of the edge or the non - active state , we have rather a relational structure corresponding to a directed or oriented graph .",
    "furthermore , the ordinary mathematical model spaces are static . as we discussed in earlier papers , the states on the network and",
    "hence also the geometric structure follow a dynamical network law which constantly changes the wiring , the orientation of the edges and the shape of the cliques or lumps together with their mutual overlap .",
    "we took this into account in @xcite by emulating it on the more macroscopic levels in form of fuzzyness of shapes and randomness of , for example , distances .",
    "that is , for each point @xmath206 we rather have a ( dense ) set of distant points , @xmath19_{in}$ ] , sending information to @xmath18 and another set , @xmath19_{out}$ ] , getting information from the point @xmath18 , both sets being time dependent .    note that in contrast to equivalence relations , subsets like @xmath19_{in}$ ] or @xmath19_{out}$ ] do not lead to a partitioning of @xmath167 .",
    "there can exist complicated overlap patterns for the respective sets belonging to points @xmath207 , nor does there exist a transitivity relation . on the other hand , on a macroscopic level ,",
    "the differences between the various model spaces of the wormhole class to be found on the finer scales may be washed out .",
    "as all the above subsets are expected to be dense in @xmath167 or @xmath2 , and therefore also in each given region of @xmath167 , any region @xmath208 gets translocal ( stochastic ) information from any other region @xmath209 and vice versa .",
    "the chain of thoughts , presented in the preceding sections , leads to a new microscopic picture of space - time and/or the quantum vacuum , strongly suggesting a translocal entanglement among distant regions of our continuous manifold .",
    "this structure is encoded in a web of relations which is largely hidden on the surface level of ( quasi)classical space - time but which , as we think , becomes observable through its expression in various features of quantum non - locality ( cf . the remarks of v.weizsaecker cited in the introduction ) .",
    "so far our approach was decidedly bottom - up , starting from a presumed underlying microscopic substratum and reconstructing the more macroscopic levels by a renormalisation - like process of coarse - graining .",
    "on the other hand , there does exist for already quite some time a more top - down oriented picture , which , coming down from the continuum side of physics , envokes the scenario of a foam - like substructure of space - time on the planck scale . in this context wheeler",
    "al developed the idea of microscopic wormholes , connecting distant parts of our ordinary space - time manifold or even different universes ( see e.g. the classical book by misner , thorne , wheeler ;",
    "@xcite ) . a beautiful and more up to date presentation",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "we note that both ideas are realized in our framework .",
    "the idea of a foamy space which is almost fractal on a truely microscopic scale and has a scale or resolution dependent dimension is realized in our geometric renormalisation procedure provided that the network is in a critical state having a dense web of practically scale - free translocal links .",
    "this was rigorously shown in the preceding sections .",
    "it is suggestive to associate these translocal links with the presumed microscopic wormholes of wheeler .",
    "associating our web of translocal links with the microscopic wormholes of wheeler we have shown that there existence is crucial in order that the dimension of space - time can become a scale dependent property , decreasing from a presumably large ( fractal ) microscopic dimension to the small integer dimension of ordinary classical space - time .",
    "that is , both ideas belong closely together .",
    "we remark that the scenario we are envisaging is not so far - fetched as it may seem . there",
    "exist , in fact , several recent investigations concerning the possible role of wormholes for the stability of the ordinary vacuum in quantum gravity . the possible effects of a gas of planckian wormholes on various physical phenomena were studied several times in the past ; as an example we mention the paper by coleman ( @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "it was argued , that in quantum gravity an array of planckian wormholes may be the correct ground state .",
    "this short list is far from being complete .",
    "all these speculations and observations seem to underpin our own line of reasoning .",
    "one of our motivations , to develop the above framework , is the goal to reach a better ( and more realistic ) understanding of the many mysteries being inherent in the various phenomena of quantum non - locality and entanglement , the evident , but not well understood , necessity of complex superposition , interference and the peculiarities of the measuring process .",
    "some of these points have been already discussed in a preliminary form in @xcite .",
    "now , with the concept of wormholespaces at our disposal , we are able to analyze these phenomena with greater rigor . in order not to blow up the size of the present paper beyond reasonable length",
    ", we will however make only some general remarks .",
    "there exist several papers in the more recent past , which strike a similar key as far as the general working philosophy or parts of the present analysis are concerned ( while the technical framework may be quite different ) .",
    "the following brief remarks are not meant as a full discussion of the field .",
    "we mention only a few points of view which seem to be particularly close to our own approach .",
    "an interesting approach has been developed by smolin ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "it is perhaps intriguing to relate the matrix - model approach in the latter paper to our bundle or foliation structure . in both cases",
    "we have an array of countable subspaces which interact with each other . at the end of @xcite ,",
    "on the other hand , one can find a brief discussion of a relational description of space - time in form of graphs .",
    "a technically slightly different line of ideas is pursued in the following papers of t hooft ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . in this approach a deterministic cellular automaton - like primordial substratum is introduced which is similar to but more regular and static than our dynamical cellular network , @xmath74 .",
    "it is argued that quantum theory might emerge on a larger scale from such a derministic and regular array .",
    "this approach has also been briefly discussed by us in @xcite .    before we come to the more obvious consequences of our presumed wormhole structure we want to briefly mention that we think that the ( somewhat mysterious ) need of employing a complex superposition principle and a complex structure in general ( @xcite ) is also a ( subtle and not so obvious ) consequence of this additional translocal web , being embedded in the ordinary continuous and locally behaving space structure .",
    "it is quite funny in this respect to see that schroedinger himself , in his row of five or six epochal papers about wave mechanics , for a very long time hold the view that , as in ordinary classical undulatory physics , one can always go over to the real part of the complex wave function if one wants to . only in the last paper of this series ( @xcite )",
    "it began to dawn on him ( possibly inspired by a letter from lorentz ) that the complex structure of quantum theory is inevitable and is buried deeply in its foundational structure ( see also the beautiful essay by yang @xcite ) .",
    "the possible consequences and deficits of quantum mechanics over a real hilbert space were analyzed in some detail in @xcite , see also the remarks in section 8 of @xcite .",
    "very illuminating in this respect is the paper of dirac ( @xcite ) in which he rightly argues that the emergence of a phase quantity is presumably even more important than the emergence of non - commuting observables .",
    "more obvious is the effect which the translocal web of weak bonds will have on the understanding of the quantum mechanical measurement process , on entanglement and other related phenomena .",
    "it was exactly the phenomenon of seemingly instantaneous collapse which stood in the way of a more realistic interpretation of the extended complex wave pattern .    assuming that einstein causality also holds sway in the quantum regime , quasi - instantaneous destruction of those parts of the wave , being located outside the region of direct measurement interference ,",
    "could only be explained by granting the wave function , or more generally , the quantum state only the ontological status of a mere bookkeeping device of the ( non)-knowledge of the observer . looked upon from a slightly different angle , this explains the dominance of the ensemble picture .    on the other hand , if , in addition to the ordinary local and causal propagation between neighboring lumps and taking place with a finite velocity , we have a further , more subliminal translocal information transport through the web of weak bonds or , in more popular terms , through hyperspace , the almost instantaneous destruction of a real and existing excitation pattern of the vacuum becomes possible .",
    "similar considerations hold in the context of entanglement .",
    "the details of these processes need of course a subtle analysis .    as a last point to mention",
    "we want to briefly comment on the seeming dichotomy between the presumed underlying and almost hidden translocal substructure and , on the other hand , the apparent local representation in form of partial differential equation .",
    "it is one of our findings that such non - local contributions and effects may come in a local disguise , such that , without an underlying more fundamental theory , it turns out to be difficult or nearly impossible to detect the translocal pieces of a model theory and separate them from the local ones . to give an example what we have in mind .",
    "an observer , prepared to take only local interactions into account , may formulate an effective theory of locally interacting fields , @xmath210 .",
    "however , these seemingly local fields may , for example , represent @xmath211-dependent integrals over distant contribution of the field configuration or even over quantities , which do occur on a deeper , more primordial level ( as discussed in our coarse graining process ) .",
    "it could in particular happen that coupling constants turn out to be such integrated non - local quantities , an idea which obviously carry a strongly machian spirit .",
    "to show that quantum theory would exactly be such an effective theory will represent the next logical step .",
