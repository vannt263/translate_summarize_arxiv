    "deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) plays an important role in the conservation and transformation of genetic information in biological systems @xcite .",
    "opening of base pairs in dna double helix is related to functions like transcription and replication .",
    "base pair opening via nonlinear molecular excitations has been understood by several authors @xcite by proposing different models . among them",
    "the models proposed and used by yomosa @xcite , as well as by takeno and homma @xcite were based on rotation of bases in a plane normal to the helical axis of dna , and the nonlinear molecular excitations were governed by kink - antikink solitons .",
    "following takeno and homma , recently several authors @xcite studied soliton - like molecular excitations in dna by taking into account the rotation of bases . in all the above studies , both the strands of the dna double helix",
    "were considered as rigid lattices . however , in nature the force between purine bases in consecutive base pairs is repulsive , and this force is resisted by stress in the helical backbones of dna and also , the main - chain torsion angle indicates that there are elastic strain forces in both the strands @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of this non - rigidity of the strands gives rise to phonons which also play an important role in energy transfer in biological systems . in a different context ,",
    "davydov @xcite proposed a model for energy transfer in alpha helix protein molecules and he found that the propagation of molecular vibrations induce longitudinal sound waves ( phonons ) , which in turn provides a potential well that prevents vibrational dispersion , and this coupled excitation propagates as a soliton without loss of energy along hydrogen bonding spines of the alpha helical protein .",
    "thus , the study of nonlinear molecular excitations in dna double helical chains coupled with phonons in strands or in other words the influence of non - rigidity of the strands in molecular excitations has become an important task which requires a detailed investigation . in this direction , recently , xiao and his co - workers @xcite studied the influence of longitudinal vibration on the soliton excitations in dna double helix by considering the dynamic plane base rotator model of takeno - homma @xcite , and by including the longitudinal vibration and its coupling with hydrogen bonds and stacking .",
    "it was shown that the dynamics in this case is governed by a perturbed sine - gordon equation in the continuum limit , which upon solving using the method of successive approximation by iterations gives soliton under first order approximation , which shows that the effect of longitudinal vibration of the lattice on soliton is small . however , they failed to find the variation of the soliton parameters such as velocity and width explicitly during propagation under iterations .",
    "therefore , in the present paper , we study the nonlinear molecular excitations in dna double helix with non - rigid elastic strands , by solving the dynamical equation using direct soliton perturbation theory , which provides the variation of velocity and width of the soliton under perturbation in explicit analytical terms .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we consider the model hamiltonian for the above dna double helix and derive the dynamical equations . in the continuum limit ,",
    "the dynamical equations reduce to a perturbed sine - gordon equation coupled with a linear wave equation representing the longitudinal lattice vibration and this is treated in section 3 . in section 4 , a multiple scale soliton perturbation theory is developed to investigate the effect of lattice deformation on the open state configuration of dna represented in terms of kink - antikink solitons of the sine - gordon equation .",
    "the results are concluded in section 5 .",
    "we consider the b - form of a dna double helix with flexible strands , and investigate the nonlinear molecular excitations by considering a plane - base rotator model . in fig .",

    "are mainly determined by the stacking between the adjacent bases in the strands and the hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases .",

    "the dynamics of this model in the continuum limit gives rise to a perturbed sine - gordon equation coupled with a linear wave equation representing longitudinal lattice vibration , which were derived from the hamiltonian consisting of the stacking energy , hydrogen bonding energy , energy corresponding to the lattice deformation and its coupling with the stacking and hydrogen bonding energy . in the unperturbed limit ,",
    "the dynamics is governed by the kink - antikink soliton of the integrable sine - gordon equation which represents the opening of base pairs in dna without lattice deformation . in order to understand the effect of lattice deformation on the base pair opening",
    ", we carried out a perturbation analysis using multiple - scale soliton perturbation theory . from the results of variation of soliton parameters we observe that when the dna lattice deforms in a periodic way , the width of the soliton remains constant .",

    "interestingly , the soliton in all the above cases are found to be stable . from the results of the perturbed soliton we observe that the periodic lattice deformation introduces fluctuation in the width of the soliton . however , there is no change in the topological character of the soliton in the asymptotic region .",
