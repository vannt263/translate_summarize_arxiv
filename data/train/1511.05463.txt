    "the study of the condition number is also a subject of extensive study in statistics and signal processing @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the case where the matrix @xmath0 is random ( which makes the problem a lot easier a priori ) but we address restricted invertibility with the additional almost orthogonality constraint that @xmath3 should be small .",
