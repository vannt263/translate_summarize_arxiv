    "<S> during polymer translocation driven by e.g. voltage drop across a nanopore , the segments in the cis - side is incessantly pulled into the pore , which are then pushed out of it into the trans - side . </S>",
    "<S> this pulling and pushing polymer segments are described in the continuum level by nonlinear transport processes known , respectively , as fast and slow diffusions . by matching solutions of both sides through the mass conservation across the pore </S>",
    "<S> , we provide a physical basis for the cis and trans dynamical asymmetry , a feature repeatedly reported in recent numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we then predict how the total driving force is dynamically allocated between cis ( pulling ) and trans ( pushing ) sides , demonstrating that the trans - side event adds a finite - chain length effect to the dynamical scaling , which may become substantial for weak force and/or high pore friction cases .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1    the dynamics of translocation , i.e. , the polymer passage through a narrow pore , has been actively studied more than a decade  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to its relevance to cellular biological processes , i.e. , biopolymer transports in cells , the phenomenon has found promising applications in genome sequencing and related technology as a nanopore sensor  @xcite . being a unique mode of the molecular transport inherent in long flexible polymers , </S>",
    "<S> there have been numerous attempts to characterize the process and to uncover the underlying physics behind it  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such efforts have led to the consensus that the _ tension _ is a key physical quantity , which is created in the polymer by the spontaneous segment motions and/or the action of the driving force  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now we have a fairly good description of the translocation process , which may be categorized according to the magnitude @xmath0 of the bias as follows . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) unbiased regime : the tension imbalance across the pore arising from the segment exchange between cis and trans sides creates a long term power - law decaying memory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this retards the process , leading to the anomalous ( sub- ) diffusion of the so - called translocation coordinate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) weakly driven regime : with weak enough force , the polymer conformation is essentially in equilibrium , and the same physics as that in the unbiased regime applies . </S>",
    "<S> the linear response theory then leads to the anomalous drift of the translocation coordinate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) driven regime : when the rate of the driving operation is faster in comparison with the terminal time of the polymer , the genuine nonequilibrium dynamics shows up  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the action of the driving force is transmitted along the chain in the cis - side , which induces the sequential conformational deformation . here to make the connection to the regime ( ii ) clearer , it is convenient to introduce the length scale @xmath1 and the corresponding time scale @xmath2 @xcite with @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the segment size , thermal energy , respectively , and @xmath5 is a dynamical exponent . </S>",
    "<S> the shortest ( segment scale ) time scale is denoted as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the solution viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the process takes place locally in the close proximity to the pore , and the equilibrium treatment is valid up to @xmath8 , during which the tension is transmitted up to @xmath9-th monomer according to the mechanism in regime ( ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent larger scale process is governed by the driving force , thus , described by the nonequilibrium regime ( iii ) , which eventually dominates the scaling limit . </S>",
    "<S> this consideration provides the border between the regimes ( ii ) and ( iii ) as @xmath10 , the threshold force being rather weak for long chains , where @xmath11 is the polymerization index of the chain . for strong enough force ( @xmath12 ) </S>",
    "<S> , one only has the regime ( iii ) in the entire process .        </S>",
    "<S> we remark here an important distinction between regimes ( ii ) and ( iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> while in equilibrium regime ( ii ) , one can treat the cis and trans sides on even ground , a qualitative difference should unclose as a characteristic feature in the nonequilibrium driven regime ( iii ) . here , </S>",
    "<S> compared to the sequential stretching of the cis - side chain owing to the propagating tension , the chain portion , which is pushed out of the pore faster than it relaxes in the trans - side , is compressed and resides dynamically in the crowded state . while the proper description of the cis - side dynamics constitutes a basis for our current understanding of the dynamical scaling in the driven translocation  @xcite , the trans - side event has been mostly overlooked so far . </S>",
    "<S> although the occurrence of the dynamical crowding has repeatedly been addressed in recent literature e.g. through the observation of simulation snapshots  @xcite or the numerical results  @xcite , it is poorly understood , and one is left with the question as to how the process in the trans - side can be described and when it becomes important . </S>",
    "<S> below , we attempt to provide the answer to it .    </S>",
    "<S> the driving force @xmath0 sucks the cis - side polymer segments into the pore , then pushes them into the trans - side . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 the polymer is stretched in the cis - side by the force @xmath14 , while it is dynamically compressed in the trans - side by @xmath15 , and the pore plays a role of the sink and the source in the cis- and trans - sides , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a frictional force @xmath16 associated with the pore . to handle such a dynamically asymmetric situation on an equal footing , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a length scale @xmath17 ; in the cis - side , this length is a tensile blob inversely proportional to the local chain tension , while it corresponds to the concentration blob in the trans - side , from which we can identify the thermodynamic force and the transport coefficient in the respective domains . below the length scale @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> the chain conformation is essentially in equilibrium , i.e. , letting @xmath19 be the segment number constituting the blob , @xmath20  @xcite . in larger scale , the asymmetry shows up in such a way that the problem is essentially one - dimensional in the cis - side , while it is three - dimensional in the trans - side . </S>",
    "<S> keeping such a difference in the effective dimensionality @xmath21 in mind , let us introduce the dimensionless segment density @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the cis- and trans - sides , respectively , and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> given the free energy density @xmath26 and the transporting coefficient @xmath27 evaluated as a stokes friction for each blob ( non - draining case )  @xcite , the constitutive relation for the segment flux @xmath28 and the thermodynamic force can be standardized as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a @xmath21-dimensional nabla operator , and @xmath31 is the segmental diffusion coefficient , and we introduce an exponent @xmath32 , which enables us to treat the effect of hydrodynamic interactions collectively , i.e. , setting @xmath33 reduces to the above non - draining case , while @xmath34 represents the free - draining ( rouse ) dynamics  @xcite . with the continuity equation of segments </S>",
    "<S> , this leads to the nonlinear diffusion equation of the type of porous media equation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the exponent @xmath25 has different signs in the cis- and trans - sides  @xcite . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ flux ] ) , the case with plus ( minus ) sign indicates the enhanced  @xcite ( suppressed  @xcite ) flux in less dense region . </S>",
    "<S> such processes are called fast ( slow ) diffusions , which turns to be crucial in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also useful to introduce the velocity potential @xmath35 the gradient of which leads to the segment velocity @xmath36 , hence its naming .        </S>",
    "<S> take @xmath37 coordinate perpendicular to a thin wall with a small hole , which is located at the origin ( fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we set the cis - side in @xmath38 region , where the polymer is initially placed taking an equilibrium conformation . at @xmath39 , </S>",
    "<S> the translocation process begins , when one of the chain ends finds the pore . </S>",
    "<S> the segments are sequentially labeled from the first arriving end . at time @xmath40 , @xmath41-th segment is located at the pore , which is traditionally called a translocation coordinate in literature  @xcite , while @xmath42-th segment is at the rear end of the moving domain , which represents the dynamics of the tension propagation in the cis - side ( see below and fig .  1 ) .    _ cis - side dynamics ( @xmath23 ) : fast diffusion_ our dynamical equation in @xmath23 dimension describes the stretching process  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the essential nonequilibrium feature here can be captured by what we call the two - phase picture , in which the entire cis - side polymer is divided into the moving domain with a characteristic velocity @xmath43 and the yet quiescent domain ( fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> integration of the velocity potential in the moving domain range , we have @xmath44 , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the location of the tension propagation front ( see fig .  1 ) , and the positive numerical constant @xmath46 of order unity is absorbed in @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> given the nonuniform stretched conformation @xmath48 , one can obtain the force - velocity relation for the cis - side polymer @xmath49 where the boundary conditions @xmath50 ( see ref .  @xcite and @xcite arxiv ) and @xmath51 are used ( see fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , from the definition of the tension front , we have the relation @xmath52 which traces back to the initial equilibrium conformation at @xmath39 .    _ trans - side dynamics ( @xmath24 ) : slow diffusion_ the trans - side decompression process can be described by our dynamical equation in @xmath24 dimension  @xcite . taking the spherical symmetry into account </S>",
    "<S> , the integration of the velocity potential leads to @xmath53,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the radial position of the decompressed front of the trans - side chain ( see fig .  1 ) , and </S>",
    "<S> the positive numerical constant @xmath55 of order unity is absorbed in @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> to proceed , we assume that the velocity field rapidly decreases away from the pore so that the above integral can be dominated by the pore vicinity . </S>",
    "<S> we then find @xmath56 where the boundary conditions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are used . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ v_t ] ) states that the force - velocity relation in the trans - side is regularized locally as the condition for the blob closest to the pore ( see fig .  2 ) </S>",
    "<S> this may be justified by the physical observation that the injection rate is controlled by the local condition in the pore vicinity , but not aware of the position of the decompression front @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the contrast to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v_c ] ) , which includes the global information @xmath60 , reflects a qualitative difference between the pulling and pushing operations . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this first blob is pushed by @xmath61 , which is balanced by the drag force against it , i.e. , @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> putting @xmath63 into it leads to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v_t ] ) .     in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ decoupled_a ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flory and dynamical exponents are adopted as follows ; ideal chain ( i d ) @xmath64 , excluded volume chain ( ev ) @xmath65 , free - draining ( fd ) @xmath66 and non - draining ( nd ) @xmath33 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> _ mass conservation through pore_ we now patch the above described cis- and trans - sides dynamics by requiring the conservation of mass across the pore . the rate of segments sucked from the cis - side into pore is @xmath67 v_1(0 ^ -)$ ] , which is equal to the rate of segments pushed into the trans - side @xmath68 v_3(0^+ ) \\xi(0^+)^2 $ ] . using the boundary conditions at the pore </S>",
    "<S> , it can be rewritten as @xmath69 eliminating @xmath43 and @xmath70 using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v_c ] ) and  ( [ v_t ] ) , we obtain the expression of the tension front @xmath71 , hence @xmath42 via eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ init ] ) , in terms of the force allocation . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 where , as already defined , @xmath73 is the number of segments in the blob immediate vicinity of the pore in the cis - side . to get a clear - cut time dependence of the fraction of the cis - side force @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , one can rewrite eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fc_ft ] ) as @xmath76 with @xmath77 and the function @xmath78 which is monotone increasing given the domain @xmath79 ( in practice @xmath80 , however . </S>",
    "<S> see below . ) in fig .  3 , we plot @xmath81 as a function of @xmath42 . at @xmath82 , which serves as the initial condition of the nonequilibrium driven regime ( iii ) , the chain in the cis - side forms an initial tensed blob . </S>",
    "<S> this is connected to our remark in the introduction that , until this moment , cis- and trans - sides can be treated on even ground , thus , @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> along with translocation process advanced , the tension propagates in cis - side , and @xmath14 monotonically increases and eventually dominates in magnitude over @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> since the normalization factor of @xmath42 is @xmath84 , the growth of @xmath81 is unconcerned with the total chain length @xmath11 , thereby , the trans - side effect is irrelevant in the dynamical scaling scenario with the identification @xmath85 in the long chain limit  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it also predicts the smaller the driving force and/or the larger the pore friction , the larger the finite - chain length effect , since both of these make @xmath86 larger . </S>",
    "<S> the translocation time in the asymptotic limit can be derived as follows . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> , the tension propagation dynamics is described from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v_c ] ) ,  ( [ init ] ) and the first equality in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ flux_pore ] ) @xmath87 this equation can be closed by an additional relation @xmath88 valid in the driven regime ( iii ) ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite arxiv ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , the tension propagation time @xmath89 is identified as @xmath90 ; @xmath91 which coincides in leading order to the translocation time . as is evident from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , the approach to the asymptote @xmath92 is rather slow , which may cause the subtlety and difficulty to measure the force exponent in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tau ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , note @xmath93 in the limit of the weak force @xmath94 , thus , we have a crossover to the weakly driven regime ( ii ) at this force , where the cis- and trans - sides can be treated on even ground during the whole translocation process .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have provided a lucid description on the cis and trans dynamical asymmetry in the driven translocation . </S>",
    "<S> the imbalance is further promoted under higher driving force ( @xmath95 ) , which leads to the almost full stretching in the cis - side . in such situations , </S>",
    "<S> we only need to modify exponents in the transport equation in cis - side as @xmath96 and @xmath97  @xcite . for our purpose </S>",
    "<S> , this requires replacing the counterparts in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v_c ] ) and the first equation of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ flux_pore ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can then show a similar result with @xmath98 and @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath86 no longer has the meaning of the initial tensed blob in this strong force regime ; @xmath100 at @xmath101 and getting smaller with the force , which indicates the faster approach to the asymptote @xmath102 . a basic equation ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ flux ] ) ) can also be applied to the polymer transport in different space dimensions with appropriate exponents @xmath103 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the same asymmetric features would be verified in the translocation process , for instance , conducted in the slit geometry . </S>"
