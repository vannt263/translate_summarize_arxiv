    "@xmath21 is a periodic operator often called the micromotion and @xmath22 is an effective static hamiltonian - the floquet hamiltonian - that describes the behavior over many cycles .",
    "this is the temporal analogue of bloch s theorem , in addition to which we have used the usual bloch s theorem in noting that @xmath5 is conserved .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath22 satisfying @xmath23 are known as floquet - bloch states @xcite .",
    "a system prepared in one of these floquet - bloch states at time @xmath24 will return to the same state stroboscopically at times @xmath25 for integer @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the driving period .    for such a non - equilibrium system , one of the most natural observables to consider is the probability to be in each of the floquet - bloch eigenstates .",

    "we will be interested in its trace , @xmath32 .",
    "the wigner distribution naturally describes equilibrium or non - equilibrium occupation of energy eigenstates@xcite .",
    "the simplest example of this is to consider evolution of the state @xmath33 under a static single - particle hamiltonian , where @xmath34 creates a single fermion in the energy eigenvalue @xmath35 of @xmath36 .",
    "then a straightforward calculation confirms that @xmath37 is just a single peak at frequency @xmath35 :    @xmath38    similarly , if we start with many electrons , @xmath39 , then a similar calculation shows that @xmath37 is just a sum of peaks at each electron s energy : @xmath40 .",
    "thus the wigner distribution gives information about not only the occupation via the amplitude of the delta - function peaks ( @xmath41 per electron ) , but also about their time - evolution via the peak frequency .",

    "as long as the hamiltonian remains non - interacting , by wick s theorem the wigner distribution will remain the sum over occupied eigenstates of the single - particle @xmath37 .",
    "so if we start from some single - particle state @xmath44 and then turn on arbitrary drive , it is readily confirmed that @xmath37 is simply given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the state obtained by full time evolution starting from @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath48 occupied single particle states one simply sums over @xmath49 .",

    "associated with a given floquet eigenstate are a time - periodic family of wave functions , @xmath51 which describe how @xmath52 evolves during a cycle .",
    "note that by our convention for @xmath21 , @xmath53 . as this state is periodic , we may fourier decompose it : @xmath54 these floquet modes @xmath55 play an important role in the theory . in particular , if we plug the floquet eigenstate into eq .",

    "this expression simplifies even further in an important limit , namely when we average over the `` measurement time '' @xmath58 .",
    "this naturally emerges in a number of physically - relevant situations .",
    "for instance , if we put back in the phase of the drive , which enters the previous expression as @xmath59 , then averaging over the often experimentally - uncontrolled phase is equivalent to averaging over @xmath58 .",
    "equivalently , one often finds that there is experimental imprecision on the time of measurement and/or the relative phase of the pump and the probe .",
    "if this imprecision is long compared to the drive period , again the averaging emerges . denoting this so - called floquet non - stroboscopic ( fns @xcite ) averaging by an overline",
    ", we see that @xcite @xmath60 so each electron state is `` split '' into fourier modes at frequency @xmath61 with amplitude @xmath62 .",
    "note that these peaks sum up to 1 total electron , @xmath63 , by the normalization of @xmath52 .",
    "so we see that the wigner distribution again provides insight on the frequency of these sidebands as well as the probability to occupy them .",

    "other choices of polarization and momentum give qualitatively similar results .",
    "as noted in the plots and seen elsewhere@xcite , anti - crossings between the surface states occur open up near the resonance between the branches .",
    "this is the first example we will see of floquet resonance , here between two surface states .",
    "these floquet resonances , and in particular more complicated ones between the surface and the bulk , will play a starring role in the remainder of the paper .    as we will discuss in more detail later ,",

    "if we ramp too fast , we expect non - adiabatic effects as we fail to adiabatically follow these eigenstates .",
    "however , we note that because both bands are occupied , there are _ no _ non - adiabatic effects in this purely surface state model no matter how short the pulse .",
    "the reason is simply that both states in the two - level system are filled , and there is simply nowhere else in the hilbert states for the electrons to go .",

    "we will show that such novel behavior can occur when coupling these states to an empty bulk conduction band .",
    "therefore , let us now consider the presence of the bulk and see how it affects this story .      to understand the relevance of the bulk , we want to start by constructing a simple tight - binding model of a three - dimensional topological insulator .",
    "we consider one of the simplest such bulk models @xcite , namely the lattice regularization of @xmath68 : @xmath69 where @xmath6 and @xmath70 are two sets of pauli matrices corresponding to , e.g. , spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "we again assume that the electric field couples via the minimal substitution , but now with the caveat that the electric field strength decays into the bulk with length scale @xmath0 , as in fig .",

    "the surface states are strongly dressed by the drive , although details of the signal depend heavily on microscopic details of the model . at strong driving strength @xmath74 ,",
    "this `` floquet equilibrium '' ( i.e. , constant drive amplitude ) data already shows how coupling to the bulk changes the story , resulting in @xmath75 and @xmath76 sidebands that are stronger than @xmath77 due to resonant surface - bulk hybridization . in the next section",
    "we will see that this surface - bulk coupling has a strong effect when we consider a pulsed drive .",
    "while the previous section considered the response in floquet eigenstates , which would come for example from the steady - state of a continuous - wave laser , it is often more experimentally practical to use pulsed sources .",
    "this has undesirable effects such as losing perfect periodicity , but the ability to change the pulse length can also be a powerful tool to prevent heating and target a unitary response of the system .",
    "therefore , in this section we will concern ourselves with the question of how finite pulse width affects the non - equilibrium observables of driven topological insulators .    a pulsed laser",
    "may be modeled by simply multiplying the periodic drive by a slow envelope , such as a gaussian : @xmath78\\exp(-t^{2}/2\\tau_\\mathrm{pump}^{2})$ ] . in the limit of a long pulse , @xmath79 , which we consider throughout this paper . ]",
    "the envelope breaks periodicity and thus renders this no longer an exact floquet problem , though in the limit of a long pulse it is approximately periodic at any given point in time .",
    "one might then expect that the system will adiabatically track the floquet eigenstates , yielding wigner distributions similar to figs .",
    "[ fig : driven_ss_wigner_distr]a and [ fig : driven_ss_plus_bulk]a .",
    "this is almost correct but , as we will now see , only part of the story .",
    "we now simulate the coupled bulk - surface model of a ti under such pumped drive .",
    "we start deep in the past with the drive turned off and the chemical potential set such that all bulk valence band and surface states are occupied .",
    "then the exact dynamics are simulated and the wigner distribution @xmath80 computed .",
    "this function is strongly peaked in @xmath81 and highly oscillatory in @xmath58 so we smooth out the results by convolving @xmath37 by a gaussian of width @xmath82 in both the frequency and time direction : @xmath83 we refer to the result as the signal and/or intensity at frequency @xmath81 and time @xmath58 , which will be justified in sec .",
    "[ sec : arpes ] by showing its connection to arpes .",
    "if the `` probe width '' @xmath82 is much greater than the drive frequency , this convolution has the additional advantage of averaging over the drive phase , such that @xmath37 may be replaced by @xmath84 in eq .",
    "[ eq : def_i_omega_tav ] .",
    "one striking difference between the equilibrium and non - equilibrium case is that , even after the drive has been turned off , population remains in the bulk conduction states , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : driven_ss_plus_bulk]d .",
    "this phenomenon is specific to the coupled bulk / surface model , and we do not see it in the simpler dirac cone model of sec .",
    "[ sec : drive_surface_states ] .",
    "decay of excited surface states into the bulk has been anticipated in the presence of phonons @xcite , but note that this decay mechanism does not exist in our model .",
    "therefore , the population transferred to the bulk may only come from coherent non - adiabatic processes .",
    "in addition to tunneling into the bulk , we see coherent oscillations in the wigner distribution of the surface states .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : driven_ss_plus_bulk]b and c , where the signal in the @xmath67th sideband is given by weight in the @xmath67th peak at fixed @xmath85 and @xmath58 normalized by the sum over all peaks .",
    "together , these results suggest that we are seeing coherent oscillations of the population between the surface and the bulk states .",
    "we have varied the microscopic parameters over a wide range of values and found that the existence of these oscillations are remarkably robust , always appearing in tandem with an irreversible `` leaking '' into the bulk .",
    "we now seek to understand this in terms the physics of floquet resonances .",
    "resonances have long been known to play a major role in floquet systems @xcite .",
    "mathematically , they come from the fact that the drive introduces a new energy scale @xmath86 such that energies are only defined modulo @xmath86 . for a many - body system of linear size @xmath87 in @xmath88 dimensions ,",
    "the bare spectrum is extensive , scaling as @xmath89 .",
    "however , hone et al .",
    "@xcite argued that folding by @xmath86 in the thermodynamic limit leads to a denser and denser set of quasi - energy levels as the system size is increased .",
    "this in turn leads to a dense set of weakly - avoided crossings such that even simple ideas like tracking a single quasi - energy level to achieve an adiabatic limit becomes ill - defined .",
    "thus the weakly - avoided crossings , which we call floquet resonances , lead to a fundamental absence of adiabaticity in floquet systems .",
    "furthermore , they have been suggested to lead to heating effects @xcite and the breakdown of high - frequency expansions @xcite , which are two of the most important and active topics in the field of floquet engineering .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : driven_ss_plus_bulk]a , floquet resonances between the surface and the bulk states inevitably occur in systems such as ours , where the driving frequency @xmath86 is less than the bandwidth . however , there are a number of subtleties that we must consider in comparing this to the hone et al .",
    "most notably , they were considering coupling between bulk states due to the drive , whereas here we are interested in coupling between the bulk and the surface state . since the drive primarily couples to the surface states and only weakly to the bulk , one naive guess would be that the matrix elements between these states would scale as the spatial overlaps between them , @xmath90 , vanishing in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this indeed seems to be the case , but one must counterbalance it against the fact that the ( one - dimensional ) density of states at fixed @xmath5 scales as @xmath87 . thus these two effects conspire to create an order-1 gap in the quasi - energy spectrum which depends sensitively on various microscopic properties .",
    "therefore , we expect that the strength will differ significantly from model to model , e.g. , between our simple model ti and a real material .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of order 1 floquet resonances should be robust by the above argument , and thus the phenomena we describe are completely generic .",
    "floquet resonances between the surface and bulk .",
    "( a ) floquet eigenspectrum of the ti model as a function of drive strength using the same parameters as fig .",
    "[ fig : driven_ss_plus_bulk]b with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the size of the dots is proportional to the proximity of the floquet eigenstate to the top surface such that the surface state appears larger than the bulk states .",
    "( b ) illustration of the demkov - osherov model of the floquet eigenspectrum . a single surface state passes through a continuum of bulk states . as @xmath87 increases ,",
    "the increase in the density of states is offset by the decrease in the matrix elements coupling surface and bulk .",
    "the system may be approximated by a single landau - zener crossing with effective gap @xmath93 that controls both excitation of the bulk and oscillation frequency of the surface state .",
    "see text for details . ]    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration_resonance_lz]a , floquet resonances lead to a series of anti - crossings between quasienergies of the bulk and surface states .",
    "as expected , the quasienergy of the surface state depends strongly on driving amplitude , while the bulk states are nearly independent of the drive .",
    "we also confirm that as @xmath87 increases the number of anti - crossings increases as well , while the strength ( i.e. , the gap ) of the anti - crossings decreases .",
    "this situation , where a single dispersing level passes through many parallel non - dispersing ones is known in the non - floquet case as the demkov - osherov ( d - o ) model @xcite , and is an analytically tractable many - level generalization of the landau - zener ( l - z ) model @xcite .",
    "the scattering matrix of the d - o model in the long - time limit is remarkable because interference between the various avoided crossings is absent .",
    "thus , the d - o scattering problem reduces to @xmath94 independent l - z transitions , where @xmath94 is the number of bulk levels that the dispersing level surface state crosses . in our case , @xmath95 at fixed @xmath5 because we effectively have a one - dimensional problem .        for slow ramps",
    ", one expects that the dynamics of a floquet system will be dominated by resonant effects , which are captured within the appropriately - folded effective hamiltonian @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , we should be able to able to treat the floquet d - o model identically to the undriven case . assume the surface state is ramped through @xmath94 bulk states during the first half of the pump pulse by increasing @xmath97 from @xmath98 to @xmath99 such that the surface state quasienergy increases at a constant velocity @xmath100",
    "as each crossing may be treated independently , the final probability to be in the surface state is just the product of the individual probabilities : @xmath101~. \\label{eq : p_ss_a}\\ ] ] this looks exactly like the l - z problem for a single avoided crossing with matrix element @xmath102 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration_resonance_lz]b . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we expect these gaps to scale as @xmath103 from the scaling of the overlap of bulk and surface eigenstates .",
    "thus the dynamics of our model is expected to have a consistent @xmath104 limit , which is confirmed numerically in fig .",
    "[ fig : driven_ss_plus_bulk]e .",
    "in addition to the final bulk occupation , this effective gap also controls the time scale of the oscillations in the surface state sidebands .",
    "thus we see that both the incoherent transition to bulk states and coherent bulk - surface oscillations survive in the thermodynamic limit with dynamics set by the same emergent energy scale .",
    "in addition to giving a physical picture for both the surface - bulk oscillations and the non - adiabatic tunneling of electrons into the bulk , the demkov - osherov model provides a handle for understanding how these should change with the various parameters , such as the experimentally - controllable @xmath105 .",
    "one important upshot is the meaning of `` adiabaticity '' reversed from what we expect in the absence of resonances .",
    "normally one expects the adiabatic limit to correspond to slow ramping , such that the system tracks the instantaneous floquet eigenstate .",
    "however , it is clear for the resonant case that ramping the field too slowly will cause the entire population to transfer into the bulk . therefore , to `` adiabatically '' track the surface state , one must instead use a fast ramp , though still sufficiently slow to prevent direct non - resonant excitations to the bulk.@xcite more explicitly , we expect that the population remaining in the surface state at the end of the ramp should scale as @xmath106 , where the additional factor of two compared to eq .",
    "[ eq : p_ss_a ] comes from ramping up to @xmath99 then back down to @xmath98 .",

    "time - resolved pump - probe arpes works by driving the system at frequency @xmath86 with a gaussian envelope ( the pump ) which excites that electrons in the sample but does not cause it to photoemit .",

    "these electrons are then ( photo)emitted by the sample and subsequently detected . by measuring the energy and momenta of the photoemitted electrons , the detector is able to map out the material s band structure during the probe pulse , including any non - equilibrium effects given by the pump .    theoretically , the time - resolved arpes signal for an arbitrary driven hamiltonian @xmath43 is given by @xcite @xmath107\\label{eq : i_omega_tav_arpes}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if one ignores that matrix elements between the electrons in the material and the photoemitted states .",

    "<S> recent theoretical and experimental work has suggested the tantalizing possibility of opening a topological gap upon driving the surface states of a three - dimensional strong topological insulator ( ti ) with circularly polarized light . with this motivation , we study the response of tis to a driving field that couples to states near the surface . </S>",
    "<S> we unexpectedly find coherent oscillations between the surface and the bulk and trace their appearance to unavoidable resonances caused by photon absorption from the drive . </S>",
    "<S> we show how these resonant oscillations may be captured by the demkov- osherov model of multi - level landau - zener physics , leading to non - trivial consequences such as the loss of adiabaticity upon slow ramping of the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically demonstrate that these oscillations are observable in the time - dependent wigner distribution , which is directly measurable in time - resolved arpes experiments . </S>",
    "<S> our results apply generically to any system with surface states in the presence of a gapped bulk , and thus suggest experimental signatures of a novel surface - bulk coupling mechanism that is fundamental for proposals to engineer non - trivial states by periodic driving .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent emergence of topological physics in bulk materials has brought to bear an important connection between topology in the bulk and novel surface states . </S>",
    "<S> these surface states manifest a variety of interesting properties , such as exhibiting anomalous behavior that is impossible in a purely two - dimensional theory . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest example of this is the one - dimensional chiral edge states in the quantum hall effect @xcite , and the same concept applies to helical surface states and isolated dirac cones in two- and three - dimensional topological insulators respectively @xcite , as well as more exotic cases like fermi arcs in weyl and dirac semimetals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , an ever - expanding zoo of surface states is continuously being discovered @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these surface states are particularly amenable to detection by a host of modern experimental methods , such as scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these probes preferentially excite electrons near the surface and are thus able to measure and distinguish surface and bulk states . a more recent development in arpes as well as similar </S>",
    "<S> photon - in photon - out experimental setups is time - resolved pump - probe spectroscopy , in which the system is be excited far from equilibrium and the state detected during the relaxation process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this gives much richer insight into both the static and dynamic properties of the quantum system and has also given rise to a recent re - emergence of theory for such far - from - equilibrium systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , there is an active search for examples of drive - induced topological phases @xcite and significant theoretical progress towards their classification@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one important development in the field has been a recent experiment@xcite in which a time - reversal - invariant topological insulator ( ti ) was irradiated with a pulse of light and imaged via pump - probe arpes . </S>",
    "<S> the dirac cone on the surface of these materials is a seed of new topological physics , and the experiment sees a gap open in the dirac cone upon applying circularly polarized light . </S>",
    "<S> this gap is predicted to be topological in the sense that it realizes a half - integer quantum hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    motivated by this development , in this paper we explore the non - equilibrium dynamics of a topological insulator in the presence of a short pulsed drive . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse breaks the perfect periodicity of the drive , yet we numerically see floquet - bloch sidebands as in the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find an unexpected oscillation in the intensity of these sidebands , which we identify as a novel bulk - surface coupling induced by the local drive at the surface . we show that this coupling leads to _ coherent _ oscillations between the surface and the bulk that survive in the thermodynamic limit , which generically arise through a simple many - level landau - zener picture that depends on floquet resonances . </S>",
    "<S> this model yields several non - trivial predictions , including reversing the meaning of adiabaticity its traditional non - resonant behavior : faster ramps appear more `` adiabatic '' because they see the resonances for less time , and thus decreasing the ramp rate leads to stronger bulk - surface oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these resonant oscillations are not only visible in the wigner distribution , a non - equilibrium observable measurable in pump - probe arpes , but are completely generic to periodically - driving the surface of any material with surface states inside a gapped bulk . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a measurable signature of this non - trivial surface - bulk resonance that should play a major role in floquet engineering of driven surface states .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : fb_review </S>",
    "<S> ] we introduce the idea of floquet - bloch states and a non - equilibrium observable  the wigner distribution  that can be used to measure them . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss the behavior of these states at constant amplitude of drive for the simplest single - dirac - cone model of ti surface states followed by a more complicated model in which coupling is allowed to the bulk . in section  [ sec : non_adiabatic_pulse ] we see how the floquet - bloch states are modified by turning the drive on and off non - adiabatically via a gaussian pump pulse . </S>",
    "<S> one important effect that we see is resonance between the surface and bulk , which we proceed to describe using a many - level generalization of landau - zener tunneling known as the demkov - osherov model . finally , in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : arpes_fapt ] , we analytically derive other leading corrections to the adiabatic floquet - bloch signal using the floquet generalization of adiabatic perturbation theory . </S>"
