    "this paper discusses derived equivalences , their construction and their use , for finite dimensional algebras , with a special focus on finite group algebras .    in a first part , we discuss brou s abelian defect group conjecture and its ramifications .",
    "this is one of the deepest problem in the representation theory of finite groups .",
    "it is part of local representation theory , which aims to relate characteristic @xmath0 representations of a finite group with representations of local subgroups ( normalizers of non - trivial @xmath0-subgroups ) .",
    "we have taken a more functorial viewpoint in the definition of classical concepts ( defect groups , subpairs , ... ) .    in  [ secconj ] , we present alperin s conjecture , which gives a prediction for the number of simple representations , and brou s conjecture , which is a much more precise prediction for the derived category , but does apply only to certain blocks ( those with abelian defect groups ) .    we discuss in  [ secvarious ] various types of equivalences that arise and present the crucial problem of lifting stable equivalences to derived equivalences .    in  [ secloc ] , we present some local methods .",
    "we give a stronger version of the abelian defect group conjecture that can be approached inductively and reduced to the problem explained above of lifting stable equivalences to derived equivalences .",
    "roughly speaking , in a minimal counterexample to that refinement of the abelian defect conjecture , there is a stable equivalence .",
    "work of rickard suggested to impose conditions on the terms of the complexes : they should be direct summands of permutation modules .",
    "we explain that one needs also to put conditions on the maps , that make the complexes look like complexes of chains of simplicial complexes .",
    "there is no understanding on how to construct candidates complexes who would provide the derived equivalences expected by the abelian defect group conjecture in general . for finite groups of lie type ( in non - describing characteristic ) , we explain (  [ secchev ] ) brou s idea that such complexes should arise as complexes of cohomology of deligne - lusztig varieties .",
    "we describe (  [ secjordan ] ) the jordan decomposition of blocks ( joint work with bonnaf ) , as conjectured by brou : morita equivalences between blocks are constructed from the cohomology of deligne - lusztig varieties . for @xmath1 ,",
    "every block is shown to be morita equivalent to a unipotent block .",
    "this provides some counterpart to the jordan decomposition of characters ( lusztig ) . in  [ secdladc ] and [ secreg ]",
    ", we explain the construction of complexes in the setting of the abelian defect conjecture .",
    "there are some delicate issues related to the choice of the deligne - lusztig variety and the extension of the action of the centralizer of a defect group to that of the normalizer .",
    "this brings braid groups and hecke algebras of complex reflection groups .    in  [ secgeo ]",
    ", we explain how to view the problem of lifting stable equivalences to derived equivalences as a non - commutative version of the birational invariance of derived categories of calabi - yau varieties .    in  [ secperv ] , we describe a class of derived equivalences which are filtered shifted morita equivalences ( joint work with chuang ) .",
    "we believe these are the building bricks for most equivalences and the associated combinatorics should be interesting .",
    "part  [ secinvar ] is devoted to some invariants of derived equivalences . in ",
    "[ secauto ] , we explain a functorial approach to outer automorphism groups of finite dimensional algebras and deduce that their identity component is preserved under various equivalences .",
    "this functorial approach is similar to that of the picard group of smooth projective schemes and we obtain also an invariance of the identity component of the product of the picard group by the automorphism group , under derived equivalence .    in  [ secgrad ] , we explain how to transfer gradings through derived or stable equivalences . as a consequence",
    ", there should be very interesting gradings on blocks with abelian defect .",
    "this applies as well to hecke algebras of type @xmath2 in characteristic @xmath3 , where we obtain gradings which should be related to geometrical gradings .",
    "finally , in  [ secdim ] , we explain the notion of dimension for triangulated categories , in particular for derived categories of algebras and schemes .",
    "this applies to answer a question of auslander on the representation dimension and a question of benson on loewy length of group algebras .",
    "part  [ seccat ] is devoted to `` categorifications '' .",
    "such ideas have been advocated by i.  frenkel and have already shown their relevance in the work of khovanov @xcite on knot invariants .",
    "our idea is that `` classical '' structures have natural higher counterparts .",
    "these act as symmetries of categories of representations or of sheaves .    in  [ secsl2 ] , we explain the construction with chuang of a categorification of @xmath4 and we develop the associated `` @xmath5-representation theory '' .",
    "there is an action on the sum of module categories of symmetric groups , and we deduce the existence of derived equivalences between blocks with isomorphic defect groups , using the general theory that provides a categorification of the adjoint action of the weyl group .",
    "this applies as well to general linear groups , and gives a solution to the abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric and general linear groups .    in  [ secbraid ] , we define categorifications of braid groups .",
    "this is based on soergel s bimodules .",

    "a consequence of the conjecture is an isometry @xmath38 with good arithmetical properties ( a _ perfect isometry _ ) .",
    "note that the conjecture also carries homological information : if @xmath22 is the principal block and the equivalence sends the trivial module to the trivial module , we deduce that the cohomology rings of @xmath11 and @xmath39 are isomorphic , a classical and easy fact .",
    "it is unclear whether there should be some canonical equivalence in conjecture [ adc ] .",
    "local representation theory is the study of the relation between modular representations and local structure of @xmath11 .",
    "alperin s conjecture asserts that the number of simple modules in a block can be computed in terms of local structure .",

    "a major problem with question [ liftability ] and with conjecture [ adc ] is to understand the relevance of the assumption that the defect groups are abelian .",
    "cf  [ secgradabelian ] for a possible idea .",
    "in an ideal situation , equivalences would arise from permutation modules or more generally , from chain complexes of simplicial complexes @xmath76 acted on by the groups under consideration .",
