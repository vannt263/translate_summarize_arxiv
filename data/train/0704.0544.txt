    "it is known that electrostatic forces determine the properties of various systems : physical as well as chemical or biological . in particular , the coulomb interactions are of great importance when dealing with ionic fluids i.e. , fluids consisting of dissociated cations and ions . in most cases",
    "the coulomb interaction is the dominant interaction and due to its long - range character can substantially affect the critical properties and the phase behavior of ionic systems .",
    "thus , the investigations concerning these issues are of great fundamental interest and practical importance .    over the last ten years",
    ", both the phase diagrams and the critical behavior of ionic solutions have been intensively studied using both experimental and theoretical methods .",
    "these studies were stimulated by controversial experimental results , demonstrating the three types of the critical behavior in electrolytes solutions : ( i ) classical ( or mean - field ) and ( ii ) ising - like behavior as well as ( iii ) crossover between the two @xcite . in accordance with these peculiarities",
    ", ionic solutions were conventionally divided into two classes , namely : `` solvophobic '' systems with ising - like critical behavior in which coulomb forces are not supposed to play a major role ( the solvent is generally characterized by high dielectric constant ) and `` coulombic '' systems in which the phase separation is primarily driven by coulomb interactions ( the solvent is characterized by low dielectric constant )",
    ". hence the criticality of the coulombic systems became a challenge for theory and experiment .",
    "a theoretical model which demonstrates the phase separation driven exclusively by coulombic forces is a restricted primitive model ( rpm ) @xcite . in this model",
    "the ionic fluid is described as an electroneutral binary mixture of charged hard spheres of equal diameter immersed in a structureless dielectric continuum .",
    "early studies @xcite established that the model has a gas - liquid phase transition . a reasonable theoretical description of the critical point in the rpm was accomplished at a mean - field ( mf ) level using integral equation methods @xcite and debye - hckel theory @xcite . due to controversial experimental findings",
    ", the critical behavior of the rpm has been under active debates @xcite and strong evidence for an ising universal class has been found by recent simulations @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies .    in spite of significant progress in this field ,",
    "the criticality of ionic systems are far from being completely understood .",
    "the investigation of more complex models is very important in understanding the nature of critical behavior of real ionic fluids demonstrating both the charge and size asymmetry as well as other complexities such as short - range attraction .",
    "a description of a crossover region when the critical point is approached is of particular interest for such models .",
    "based on the experimental findings one can suggest that in ionic fluids the temperature interval of crossover regime , characterized by the ginzburg temperature , is much smaller than observed in nonionic systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , a sharp crossover was reported for the systems @xmath2 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of experimental data for various ionic solutions confirmed that such systems generally exhibit crossover or , at least a tendency to crossover from the ising behavior asymptotically close to the critical point , to the mean - field behavior upon increasing distance from the critical point @xcite .",
    "moreover , the systematic experimental investigations of the ionic systems such as tetra-@xmath3-butylammonium picrate , @xmath4 , ( for tetra-@xmath3-butylammonium picrate we will follow the notations from @xcite ) in long chain @xmath3-alkanols with dielectric constant ranging from @xmath5 for @xmath6-tetradecanol to @xmath7 for @xmath8-propanol suggest an increasing tendency for crossover to the mean - field behavior when the coulomb contribution becomes essential @xcite .",
    "they also indicate that the `` coulomb limit '' reduced temperature of the rpm @xmath9 is valid for the almost non - polar long chain alkanols @xcite .",
    "it has been stressed @xcite that for solutions of @xmath4 in @xmath6-alkanols , the upper critical solution points are found to increase linearly with the chain length of the alcohols ( that corresponds to the decrease of dielectric constant of the solvent ) .",
    "the experimental data for the critical points and the dielectric permittivities for solutions of @xmath4 in @xmath6-alkanols are given in table  1 @xcite .",
    ".the experimental parameters of the critical points ( critical temperature @xmath10 , critical mass fraction @xmath11 ) and the corresponding dielectric constants @xmath12 for solutions of @xmath4 in @xmath6-alkanols @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we study the reduced ginzburg temperature as a function of the interplay between the short- and long - range interactions .",
    "the ionic fluid is modelled as a charge asymmetric continuous system that includes additional short - range attractions . the model without coulomb interactions exhibits a gas - liquid critical point belonging to the ising class of criticality .",
    "we derive an effective glw hamiltonian for the model whose coefficients have the form of an expansion in powers of the ionicity . using these coefficients",
    "we calculate a ginzburg temperature depending on the ionicity . to this end",
    "we introduce a specific model which consists of charged hard spheres of the same diameter interacting through the additional square - well potentials . to study the effect of the interplay between short- and long - range interactions we change , besides the ionicity , the range of the square - well potential .",
    "as a result , we obtain the similar tendency for the reduced ginzburg temperature as in @xcite when the region of the short - range attraction increases i.e. , its nonmonotonic character but with different numerical characteristics",
    ". however , our results demonstrate a much faster decrease of the ginzburg temperature when the ionicity increases . we found a good qualitative and sufficient quantitative agreement with the experimental findings for @xmath4 in @xmath3-alkanols .",
    "this confirms the experimental observations that an interplay between the solvophobic and coulomb interactions alters the temperature region of the crossover regime i.e. , the increase of the ionicity that can be related to the decrease of dielectric constant leads to the decrease of the crossover region .",
    "we suggest that the quantitative discrepancy of the results for @xmath0 obtained in @xcite and in this work could be due to the fact , besides the difference in the symmetry of the two models , that the chemical potential ( or density ) dependence of the hamiltonian coefficients was taken into account explicitly in our case .",
    "it should be noted that in the approximation considered in this paper only the critical chemical potential depends explicitly on the charge magnitude . in order to obtain the charge dependence of the other quantities terms of order higher than @xmath13 should be taken into account into the effective hamiltonian .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the functional representation ( [ 2.5])-([action ] ) allows to consider more complicated models in particular models including charge and size asymmetry .",
