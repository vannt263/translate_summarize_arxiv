    ".    this argument clearly does not apply to metrics that are not complete at infinity , and hence a more detailed analysis is required for the proof of theorem  [ thm : strong ] . once again , we rely on elementary mapping properties of functions near a singular value , @xmath41 , that is not the limit of critical values .",

    "hence @xmath275 , as claimed .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the first notion of `` expanding '' entire functions , which coincides with our notion of hyperbolicity in definition  [ thmdef : hyperbolicity ] , goes back to mcmullen @xcite .",
    "as also mentioned , rippon and stallard @xcite discuss hyperbolicity in the transcendental setting , arguing that functions in the class @xmath25 satisfying  [ item : singularattracting ] in theorem  [ thmdef : hyperbolicity ] deserve to be called hyperbolic .",
    "however , they left open the possibility that other functions might also be classed as `` hyperbolic '' .",
    "mayer and urbanski @xcite gave a definition of hyperbolicity that relies on the euclidean metric .",
    "specifically , they require both uniform expansion on the julia set and that the postsingular set be a definite ( euclidean ) distance away from the julia set . without additional requirements , this includes such functions as our examples in the introduction , which exhibit `` non - hyperbolic '' phenomena and are not stable under simple perturbations ; see appendix b.    with an additional strong regularity assumption near the julia set , mayer and urbanski obtained strong and striking results concerning the measurable dynamics of `` hyperbolic '' functions in the above sense ; further properties of these functions are described in @xcite .",
    "we are , however , not aware of any examples outside of the class @xmath25 where these assumptions are known to hold . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath26 is hyperbolic in the sense of mayer and urbanski , then it is also hyperbolic in the sense of theorem  [ thmdef : hyperbolicity ] .",
    "all of these definitions are in fact formulated , more generally , for transcendental _ meromorphic _ functions . in this setting , there is a third , and strongest , notion of hyperbolicity , studied by zheng @xcite .",
    "this requires , in addition , that infinity is not a singular value , and hence can never be satisfied when @xmath2 is transcendental entire .",
    "an example of a function with this property is @xmath276 , for @xmath277 .",
    "( we note that zheng also studied the definitions given by rippon and stallard and by mayer and urbanski ; we refer to his paper for further details . )",
    "zheng s definition of `` hyperbolicity on the riemann sphere '' may be considered to correspond most closely to the case of hyperbolic rational functions .",
    "in particular , zheng shows that a meromorphic function is hyperbolic in this sense if and only if it satisfies a certain uniform expansion property with respect to the spherical metric",
    ".    our results also apply in the setting of meromorphic functions , with appropriate modifications of definitions to correctly handle prepoles . once again , they indicate that the notion of hyperbolicity does not make sense outside of the class @xmath25 .",
    "we recall also our earlier comment that , although our applications are to meromorphic functions on subsets of the complex plane , our basic results regarding the properties of singularities are given for analytic functions between riemann surfaces .",
    "a generalisation of the study of transcendental dynamics into this setting is possible for the classes of `` finite type maps '' , and more generally `` ahlfors islands maps '' , suggested by epstein @xcite . if @xmath13 is a riemann surface and @xmath69 is a compact riemann surface , then an analytic function @xmath278 is called a _ finite - type map _",
    "if @xmath9 is finite and @xmath2 has no removable singularities at any punctures of @xmath13 . in the case where @xmath279 , epstein develops an iteration theory that carries over the basic results from the theory of rational dynamics and of entire and meromorphic functions with finitely many singular values .",
    "similarly to the case of meromorphic functions , we could again consider two different notions of hyperbolicity in this setting : one , analogous to that of zheng , where all singular values must lie in attracting basins or map outside of the closure of @xmath13 ; and a weaker notion , in analogy to that of rippon and stallard , where we allow singular values to lie on ( or map into ) the boundary of the domain of definition .",
    "all the standard results for the case of meromorphic functions should extend to this setting also .",
    "the larger class of _ ahlfors islands maps _ includes all transcendental meromorphic functions , as well as all finite type maps .",
    "it is tempting to define an `` eremenko - lyubich class '' of such maps , consisting of those for which @xmath280 is a compact subset of the domain of definition @xmath13 .",
    "our results still apply in this setting , and imply that hyperbolicity is only to be found within this class . however , it is no longer clear that functions _ within _ this class have suitable expansion properties near the boundary , and hence dichotomies such as that of theorem a break down . finding a natural class that extends both the eremenko - lyubich class of entire functions and all finite type maps appears to be an interesting problem",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the three functions @xmath281 mentioned in the introduction .",
    "all three are well - studied , and have properties that are not compatible with what would normally be considered hyperbolic behaviour .",
    "a.   @xmath282 has a baker domain containing the right half - plane @xmath283 .",
    "that is , @xmath284 , and @xmath285 for all @xmath286 ; b.   @xmath287 has infinitely many superattracting fixed points , @xmath288 ; c.   @xmath289 has @xmath290 , and possesses an orbit of wandering domains .",
    "the function @xmath287 is precisely newton s method for finding the points where @xmath291 ; it was studied in detail by weinreich @xcite .",
    "clearly it follows directly from the definition that the points @xmath292 are indeed superattracting fixed points .",
    "the function @xmath289 is a well - known example of a transcendental entire functions with wandering domains , first described by herman ; see ( * ? ? ?",

    "since the points @xmath292 all belong to different fatou components for @xmath287 , the same is true for @xmath289 . since @xmath295 , they do indeed belong to an orbit of wandering domains for @xmath289 .      for each @xmath296",
