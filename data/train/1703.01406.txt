    "antiferromagnets ( afms ) show great potential to replace ferromagnets ( fms ) in spintronic applications  @xcite . compared with fms , afms",
    "have the advantages of much faster spin dynamics  @xcite , more stability against charge and external field perturbations  @xcite , and no stray field  @xcite .",
    "however , since the afm spins align in alternating directions of magnetic moments on individual atoms , the resulting zero net magnetization makes hard to control afm magnetic moments .",
    "recently , there have been several reports regarding the control of afm moments by applying an electronic current in afm films  @xcite and fm / afm bilayers  @xcite , by field cooling ( fc )  @xcite and by applying an external field via the exchange - spring effect  @xcite .",
    "these studies demonstrated that the afm moments can be controlled and detected using electronic transport measurements without the need for large - scale facilities such as synchrotron and neutron facilities  @xcite .",
    "afm rotation is of interest because a more than 100% spin - valve - like signal has been achieved in tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance ( tamr ) stacks by controlling the afm spin configuration via the exchange - spring effect of fm on afm  @xcite .",
    "the exchange coupling has been widely used in spintronic devices such as spin - valve - type magnetic memory devices to pin the fm magnetization  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , tamr utilizes the rotating afm exchange - coupled to fm  @xcite .",
    "the rotating afm can be linked to the shift of hysteresis loops ( exchange bias ) and broadening of the coercivity in magnetization measurements  @xcite .",
    "although several studies have been reported regarding the rotating afm  @xcite , almost all of the studies have been performed on polycrystalline stacks using afm for irmn .",
    "since the afm moments rotate with exchange - coupled fm , the afm rotation behavior is expected to be affected by the fm magnetization switching process .",
    "thus , the effect of fm magnetocrystalline anisotropy resulting from the full epitaxial growth is more interesting .",
    "in addition , all the studies have been performed using typical @xmath1 metal fms such as nife and co. similar to successful studies on giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) and tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr )  @xcite , there is a clear need to study high - quality heterostructures with more advanced compounds such as those with high - spin polarization needed for spintronic devices  @xcite .    for the advanced materials , we focused on the heusler compound fe@xmath0crsi ( fcs ) , which is theoretically expected to be half - metallic fm  @xcite .",
    "the four - fold magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant of fcs is known to be 266  j / m@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "in addition , since only fully epitaxial stacks effectively provide the advanced properties , the heusler compound ru@xmath0mnge ( rmg ) was selected for afm ; we succeeded in growing fully epitaxial fcs / rmg bilayers  @xcite .",
    "rmg exhibits the highest n@xmath3el temperature , @xmath4  k , among heusler compounds  @xcite .",
    "in addition , rmg has a nearly half - metallic electronic structure  @xcite .",
    "since the tamr depends on spin configuration of afm , such an afm electronic structure is interesting .    in this letter",

    "although fc - direction dependence was performed , no change was observed .",
    "these results indicate that the symmetric and asymmetric curves are not determined by the relative angle @xmath9 between @xmath40 and @xmath29 , indicating that the obtained angular dependences are not typical amr of fm .",
    "then , because the symmetric and asymmetric relations are not changed by the fc directions , the factor governing the angular dependence of the bilayers is not the sensing current or fc directions but the fcs / rmg crystalline direction .",

    "( c , d ) fcs magnetization switching process where the field sweeps along the easy and hard axes , respectively . , width=321 ]    one possible cause of the crystalline - direction - dependent afm rotation is the fm magnetization switching process .",
    "fcs has four - fold magnetocrystalline anisotropy , where the easy axes are oriented along @xmath19 and @xmath42 , and the hard axes are oriented along @xmath43 and @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "this property indicates that symmetric mr curves appear along the hard axes of fcs , and asymmetric mr curves appear along the easy axes of fcs .",
    "it is well known that the fm magnetization switching processes with four - fold magnetocrystalline anisotropy differ along the easy and hard axes . as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : four](c ) , the magnetization rotates by 180@xmath13 along the easy axes . on the other hand , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : four](d ) , the magnetization rotates in 3 steps along the hard axes ; ( i ) the magnetization rotates toward the nearest easy axis , ( ii ) the magnetization jumps in a direction close to the other easy axis , and ( iii ) the magnetization finally rotates toward the applied field direction  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the magnetization rotates by up to 90@xmath13 along the hard axis .",
    "a possible explanation for the full and partial afm rotations along fcs / rmg @xmath19 and @xmath43 are that the afm can fully follow the fm magnetization switching via the fm rotation when the field sweep is along the hard axis of fm because the magnetization rotates slightly ( up to 90@xmath13 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the afm can not fully follow when the field sweep is along the easy axis of fm because the magnetization rotates a lot ( 180@xmath13 ) .",
    "these results could provide a route to understanding the afm rotation behavior .",
    "since the mr curves suggest the importance of afm spin configuration , as discussed above , the larger @xmath5 ratio compared with that of only single - layer fcs films can be considered to be due to afm moments . to date , there have been several studies of afm amr due to spin flop  @xcite , crystalline amr originating from large anisotropies in the relativistic electronic structure  @xcite and afm spin configurations with respect to current direction  @xcite . in the crystalline amr study ,",
    "the afm spins were reoriented by applying magnetic fields via the exchange spring effect  @xcite , which is the same condition as that in our study . in addition,the @xmath5 ratio",
    "was obtained under @xmath45  koe with small angle steps ( @xmath4615@xmath13 ) , indicating that the afm moments can fully follow the fm magnetization rotation as mentioned above .",
    "the afm spin reorientation is reinforced by the delay of angular dependence due to the exchange - spring effect  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : four](b ) . then , the resistance is higher for the configuration of afm moments aligned along [ 110 ] and [ -1 - 10 ] than for the configuration of afm moments aligned along [ 1 - 10 ] and [ -110 ] .",
    "these resistance changes due to the afm spin direction have been reported in fm / afm bilayers  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the asymmetric mr curves were transformed into symmetric mr curves with increasing temperature .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the obtained larger @xmath5 ratio compared with that of only single - layer fcs films originates from the reorientation of the afm moments by applying magnetic fields via fm rotation",
    ". the obtained @xmath5 ratio of approximately 5.9  @xmath28 is much larger than other afm amr ratios for sr@xmath0iro@xmath47 of approximately 1  % and mnte of approximately 1.6  % .",
    "this result might be related to either the nearly half - metallic rmg electronic structure or the electronic structures of both rmg and fcs .",
    "we performed a magnetotransport study of fcs / rmg bilayers to clarify the afm rotation behavior .",
    "in addition to the same @xmath7 thickness dependence of the magnitude of the @xmath5 ratio and exchange bias , the mr curves changed from symmetric to asymmetric based on @xmath7 in response to the direction of fcs magnetocrystalline anisotroy .",
    "the maximum @xmath5 ratio of the bilayers was more than an order of magnitude larger than that of single - layer fcs films due to the reorientation of afm moments via the fm rotation .",
    "we also observed that the afm moments could fully rotate when the field sweep was along the hard axes of fcs but could not fully rotate along the easy axes of fcs , demonstrating the impact of fcs magnetocrystalline anisotropy to govern the afm rotation .",
    "these results provide profound insights into the control of the afm moments and promote the application of afm in spintronics .",
