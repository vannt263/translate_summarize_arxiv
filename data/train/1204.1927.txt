    "given the results of this section and theorem [ ring - codegree ] , it would be interesting to solve the following problem .",
    "determine @xmath266 or @xmath298 for each fixed value of @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath249 be a prime power and let @xmath299 be @xmath300-graph with vertex set equal to the one dimensional subspaces of @xmath301 and edges corresponding to the two - dimensional subspaces of @xmath301 .",
    "we call @xmath299 the _ projective geometry _ of dimension @xmath18 over @xmath302 ; note that @xmath303 is the fano plane . in @xcite , keevash also proved the following more general theorem about projective geometries      furthermore , there is a nearly matching lower bound when @xmath249 is an odd prime power ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the proof we present in section [ fano ] relies on the fact that there is a family of @xmath0-graphs @xmath305 , such that each member @xmath306 has the @xmath307-property and @xmath308 .",
    "in fact , our same proof could be used to give a simple proof of theorem [ keevashpg ] if there was an affirmative answer to the following question .",
    "[ lm ] let @xmath309 .",
    "does there exist a finite family @xmath310 of @xmath9-graphs such that for each @xmath311 there exists a positive integer @xmath99 such that @xmath312 has the @xmath189-property and @xmath313 .",
    "it seems conceivable that obtaining a @xmath9-graph with the @xmath116 property for some other values of @xmath115 and @xmath117 might give us the same benefit and be easier to obtain ; however , this is not the case . on one hand",
    ", we must have @xmath314 so that equation holds . on the other hand",
    ", when @xmath315 the complete balanced bipartite @xmath9-graph @xmath316 , which has @xmath317 , does not contain any subgraph with the @xmath116-property ( any subgraph of @xmath316 with @xmath115 vertices must contain an independent set of size @xmath318 ) .",
    "so we must have @xmath319 , which implies that @xmath115 is even and @xmath320 .",
    "a different problem is the following .",
    "instead of determining the co - degree threshold for a single copy of @xmath1 in @xmath26 , one can ask about the co - degree threshold for @xmath321 vertex disjoint copies of @xmath1 in @xmath26 ( assuming @xmath322 divides @xmath323 ) .",
    "this has been referred to as the _ tiling _ or _ factoring _ problem and received much attention lately .",
    "interestingly , the co - degree threshold for tiling with @xmath15 and @xmath324 have been determined ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , but the co - degree threshold for a single copy of @xmath15 or @xmath324 is still unknown and appears to be difficult . since the co - degree threshold for a single copy of @xmath4 is known and seems to be much easier than @xmath15 or @xmath324 , it would be interesting to determine the co - degree threshold for tiling with @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath3 be divisible by @xmath325 and let @xmath26 be a @xmath0-graph on @xmath3 vertices . determine the minimum value @xmath326 such that @xmath327 implies that @xmath26 contains @xmath328 vertex disjoint copies of @xmath4 .",
    "the relationship between the edge density of a hypergraph and its subgraphs with large co - degree is also very intriguing .",
    "even the following simple questions do not seem to have an easy answer .",
    "a @xmath9-graph @xmath1 is said to _ cover pairs _ if @xmath1 has at least @xmath329 vertices and every pair of vertices lies in some edge , i.e. @xmath330 .                l. caccetta and r. hggkvist , on minimal digraphs with given girth , proceedings of the ninth southeastern conference on combinatorics , graph theory , and computing ( florida atlantic univ . ,",
