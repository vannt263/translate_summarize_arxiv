    "unimodal , log - concave and log - convex sequences arise naturally in many problems in combinatorics and elsewhere ; see @xcite and @xcite@xcite , for example .",
    "unimodality properties of sequences associated with pascal s triangle have always been of interest ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , su and wang @xcite have shown that the sequence of binomial coefficients located on a ray of pascal s triangle is unimodal , as conjectured by belbachir et al .",

    "also , in conjecture [ conj ] , @xmath26 is permitted , in which case the sequence @xmath27 is log - convex for all @xmath28 .    in this work",
    "we confirm conjectures [ conj0 ] and [ conj ] .",
    "our proof of conjecture [ conj0 ] ( in section 2 ) follows the combinatorial approach of gessel and viennot @xcite and brenti @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the proof of conjecture [ conj ] ( in section 3 ) , which uses a variation - diminishing property of the laplace transform , is analytic . in the process of proving conjecture [ conj ] , we also obtain theorem [ thm1 ] , which generalizes a result of su and wang ( @xcite , proposition 1 ) that deals with the case @xmath29 .",

    "let us recall some useful terms .",
    "an infinite matrix @xmath34 is called _ totally positive _ if every minor of @xmath35 is nonnegative . a nonnegative sequence @xmath36 ,",

    "[ pf ] a nonnegative sequence @xmath42 is a pf sequence if and only if the polynomial @xmath17 has only real zeros .",

    "what follows , a _",
    "planar network _ is a directed , acyclic , planar graph with no loops or multiple edges .",
    "we allow the network to be infinite , but require that it is _ locally finite _ ,",
    "i.e. , there exist a finite number of paths between any two vertices .",
    "in addition , our network is associated with two sets of distinguished boundary vertices , one set on each side , and numbered from top to bottom as @xmath43 ( the sources ) and @xmath44 ( the sinks ) respectively .",
    "( see @xcite for a more precise formulation . )",
    "define the _ path matrix _ @xmath45 of such a network by @xmath46 the following key lemma dates back to karlin and mcgregor @xcite and lindstrm @xcite .",
    "this and related techniques are used by gessel and viennot @xcite , stembridge @xcite , sagan @xcite and brenti @xcite to tackle many combinatorial problems .",
    "[ lind ] the path matrix @xmath35 of a locally - finite planar network is totally positive .",
    "specifically , any @xmath47 minor of @xmath35 is equal to the number of families of vertex - disjoint paths that connect the sources labeled by @xmath48 with the sinks labeled by @xmath49 .",

    "if @xmath68 , then there are precisely @xmath69 such paths . by lemma [ lind ] , the matrix @xmath70 is totally positive ; by lemma [ pf ] , conjecture [ conj0 ] is valid .    * remark . * the delannoy number ( @xcite ) @xmath71 counts the number of lattice paths from @xmath72 to @xmath73 using only east , north and northeast steps ; the recursion @xmath74 holds with the initial values @xmath75 .",
    "we have a result analogous to conjecture [ conj0 ] for the delannoy numbers .    [ delannoy ]",

    "then the polynomial @xmath77 has only real zeros .",
    "indeed , we can modify the planar network in the proof of conjecture [ conj0 ] by adding all the edges from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "this new network then has @xmath80 as its path matrix , and theorem [ delannoy ] follows from lemmas [ lind ] and [ pf ] as before",
    ".    it would be interesting to know whether results similar to conjecture [ conj0 ] and theorem [ delannoy ] hold for the stirling numbers of either kind , the eulerian numbers , or their q - analogues .",
    "many matrices associated with these classical numbers are known or conjectured to be totally positive ( brenti @xcite ) .",
    "we shall analyze the quantity of interest as a laplace transform .",
    "a key tool is the following variation - diminishing property of the laplace transform ; see karlin ( @xcite , chapter 5 ) for the precise statements and ramifications .",
    "[ lem1 ] let @xmath81 be a borel - measurable function on @xmath82 , and suppose the integral @xmath83 converges absolutely for every @xmath84 .",
    "then the number of sign changes of @xmath85 in @xmath86 is no more than the number of sign changes of @xmath81 in @xmath82 .",

    "we obtain @xmath96 with @xmath97 it is easy to show that @xmath98 . also , @xmath99 for fixed @xmath100 . by watson s lemma ( see @xcite , for example ) , @xmath101 as @xmath102 .",
    "this shows that @xmath103 is asymptotically convex .",
    "note that a discrete version of this asymptotic convexity is obtained by su and wang ( @xcite , theorem 1 , part iii ) using a different method .",
    "next , we examine the number of roots of @xmath104 in @xmath105 for fixed @xmath100 .",
    "[ lem2 ] if @xmath106 , then @xmath107 .    * proof . *",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath104 is concave down in @xmath100 .",

    "let us assume @xmath109 since the case @xmath108 can be obtained by switching the roles of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we have @xmath112 consider the function @xmath113 it is easy to show that @xmath114 strictly decreases in @xmath115 .",
    "using this and @xmath95 we get @xmath116 note that theorem [ thm1 ] follows directly from lemma [ lem2 ] and expression ( [ gx ] ) .",

    "thus @xmath122    for @xmath123 , it seems hard to determine the sign of @xmath124 directly .",
    "however , straightforward calculation gives @xmath125}{e^{(u+1)pt }   ( 1-e^{-pt})^2}+\\frac{q \\left [ ( qt+1 ) e^{-qt } -1 -uqt(1-e^{-qt})\\right]}{e^{-uqt } ( 1-e^{-qt})^2}.\\ ] ] in view of the simple inequalities @xmath126 and @xmath127 , we have @xmath128 we obtain @xmath129 from ( [ der1 ] ) and ( [ der2 ] ) .",
    "lemmas [ lem2 ] and [ lem3 ] imply that , for fixed @xmath100 , @xmath104 has at most one root in @xmath130 . given ( [ gx ] ) and lemma [ lem1 ] , we know that @xmath131 changes sign at most once in @xmath86 . by ( [ watson ] ) , this possible change of sign is from negative to positive as @xmath132 increases from 0 to @xmath133 .",
