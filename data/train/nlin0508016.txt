    "<S> we study the two - dimensional extension of the fano - anderson model on the basis of a two - dimensional optical waveguide array with a bi - modal defect . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate numerically the persistence of the fano resonance in wavepacket scattering process by the defect . an analytical approximation is derived for the total scattered light power .    </S>",
    "<S> optical waveguide arrays are known to be very efficient experimental realizations of one- ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) discrete systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent achievements both in sample preparation techniques and in experimental methods allowed for observation of several important phenomena known from linear and nonlinear lattice theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these experimental successes , in turn , stimulated theorists in considering other possible implementations of waveguide arrays , being of potential interest both in fundamental and applied science . </S>",
    "<S> one of such promising directions of research , being extensively developed during recent years , is related to the possibility of direct observation of the fano resonance @xcite in processes of wave scattering by nonlinear localized excitations @xcite and in the framework of different linear and nonlinear generalizations @xcite of the fano - anderson model @xcite . in all such models a defect ( either geometrical or dynamical ) is locally attached to an otherwise translationary invariant 1d waveguide array . </S>",
    "<S> this defect mediates one or several additional propagation paths for waves , locally increasing the dimensionality of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the fano resonance manifests through the resonant reflection of light ( as the result of destructive interference between the propagation paths ) at a particular angle @xcite , defined by the defect parameters .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we consider the two - dimensional extension of the fano - anderson model . </S>",
    "<S> the setup is based on a 2d waveguide array , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> an additional defect is assumed to be locally coupled to the central waveguide @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally it can be realized e.g. by making the central waveguide to be bi - modal , so that the defect site corresponds to the second mode of this waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the overlap between the two modes of the bi - modal waveguide is much stronger than the overlap between the second mode of the central waveguide and the first ( principal ) mode of an adjacent waveguide , the coupling to the defect is essentially local .    within the framework of coupled - mode theory @xcite , the effective model equations describing the evolution of the @xmath1th waveguide mode amplitude @xmath2 and the defect mode ( the second mode of the central bi - modal waveguide ) amplitude @xmath3 along the propagation distance @xmath4 can be written as @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath7 is the effective coupling between modes of the adjacent waveguides , @xmath8 is the effective coupling between the two modes of the central waveguide , and @xmath9 describes the difference between the propagation constants of the two modes . as usual for schrdinger - type equations , eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> considering stationary solutions @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] , we obtain the following equations for @xmath14 : @xmath15 far away from the defect site @xmath0 eigenstates of the system ( [ eq2 ] ) asymptotically approach plane waves @xmath16 $ ] with the dispersion relation and group velocities given by @xmath17 respectively . the absolute value of the group velocity ( [ vg ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is shown in the density plot in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig1](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> it reaches its maximum at @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> analogously to the 1d fano - anderson model @xcite , the defect coupled to the central site acts as an effective scattering potential for traveling waves with strength depending on the spectral parameter ( @xmath19 ) of the incoming wave . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering potential diverges at @xmath20 , this constitutes the resonance condition . combining this with the dispersion relation ( [ disp ] ) , we obtain the implicit relation @xmath21 which defines the _ resonance condition curve _ in the parameter space @xmath22 plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) with thick lines . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for a plane wave coming at a certain angle ( i.e. with the fixed relation between @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) one has a unique pair of parameter values @xmath22 for which the resonance in the scattering process is expected to occur , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](d ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we performed numerical simulations of wavepacket scattering in the array of @xmath25 waveguides with fixed boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the initial wavepacket is taken in the gaussian form @xmath26 $ ] with @xmath27 , so that the effective half - width of the packet in real space is about @xmath28 sites , while the half - width in the reciprocal @xmath29-space is @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the defect parameter @xmath9 is chosen to be reasonably small , @xmath31 , so that the resonance condition curve defined by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ res_cond ] ) in the parameter space @xmath22 passes close enough to the points @xmath18 corresponding to the maximum group velocity of the wavepacket . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to save computational time in numerical simulations described below .    </S>",
    "<S> in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2],[fig3 ] characteristic snapshots of the power density @xmath32 ( [ power ] ) distribution across the array , after the scattering process has occurred , are shown for resonant and non - resonant cases , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> while for the non - resonant case the wavepacket remains practically undistorted after passing the defect site , for the resonant case a considerable amount of the initial wavepacket power is scattered in different directions . in order to estimate the amount of scattered power we define an approximate boundary between `` transmitted '' and `` scattered regions '' , see dashed line in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2],[fig3 ] . the total scattered power ( the power in the `` scattered region '' ) as a function of the wavepacket number @xmath23 for the case of diagonal propagation ( @xmath33 ) </S>",
    "<S> is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly observe the resonant peak at @xmath34 , which is in full agreement with the resonance condition @xmath35 $ ] obtained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ res_cond ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the resonant peak power of scattered light , as well as the characteristic resonance width , depend on the initial wavepacket parameters and the parameters of the defect . in order to have at least a qualitative understanding of the problem </S>",
    "<S> , we make a connection to the 1d fano - anderson model by noting that due to the locality of the defect essentially only the diagonal row in the wavepacket interact with the defect site , while the rest passes through practically undistorted , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> referring to the exact result for the transmission coefficient of plane waves in 1d case @xcite @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the wavenumber of the 1d plane wave ) and using the fourier transform of the diagonal part of the initial gaussian wavepacket , we finally arrive to the following expression for the scattered power : @xmath38e^{-(q - k_x)^2/(2\\alpha)}\\right\\ } , \\label{1d - est}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the power of the diagonal row in the initial wavepacket : @xmath40 despite the simplicity of this 1d approach , it nevertheless gives us a reasonably good estimate for the scattered power , see solid line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the noticeable reduction in the peak scattered power is due to the fact , that the effective ratio of the original wavepacket which essentially interacts with the defect is actually more than one row . </S>",
    "<S> analysing the results given by eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1d - est ] , [ dpow ] ) , we conclude that the gaussian parameter @xmath41 performs a twofold influence on the amount of scattered power . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , it controls the ratio of the initial wavepacket which effectively interacts with the defect , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dpow ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the more localized the initial wavepacket is in real space , the higher is the ratio of it which interacts with the defect . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the more it is localized in real space , the less it is localized in the reciprocal @xmath29-space . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , leads to a broadening of the transmission curve for pure plane waves , making the effective resonance width larger and , at the same time , decreasing the maximum of the scattered power . </S>",
    "<S> this broadening effect , however , can be controlled by changing the relative strength of the coupling to the defect @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the rate of broadening is defined by the ratio of the wavepacket width in @xmath29-space @xmath43 to the effective resonance width @xmath44 , the latter is known for the 1d fano - anderson model @xcite to be completely determined by the ratio @xmath42 .    to conclude , we discussed the 2d fano - anderson model based on a 2d optical waveguide array with a bi - modal central waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> using numerical simulations we demonstrate the persistence of the fano resonance in this model , which should be detectable experimentally . on the basis of a simple 1d analogue , we derive a reasonably good approximation for the total scattered power of light and study its dependence on the initial wavepacket parameters and the model parameters .    </S>",
