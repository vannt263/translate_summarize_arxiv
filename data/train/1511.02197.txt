    "visualization is an important tool in developing models of science , and particularly relativity,@xcite because although the mathematical treatment of special relativity ( sr ) is well established , its strong geometric component lends itself to visualization without relying on symbolic notation.@xcite graphical representation of einstein s defining work on sr was first provided by minkowski,@xcite and current teaching on sr has remained essentially unchanged since weyl s original book showing the light - cone.@xcite much subsequent teaching has been based on the figures in his book , and variations of these diagrams usually form the definitive background for presenting sr ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , minkowski diagrams and their associated hyperbolas do not present a direct visualization of einstein s premise that the vacuum speed of light is a universal constant for any observer in an inertial reference frame , regardless of their own motion or that of the light source .",
    "this paper presents an original approach to the geometry of sr using the core axiom that the velocity of light in a vacuum , @xmath0 , is identical to every inertial observer .",
    "the photon paths are then constructed , consistent with the standard view of the photon as lying along the surface of a light cone centred on any given event along an arbitrary world - line .",
    "in particular , any two connected events , such as the emission and detection of a photon , may be represented by two inertial world - lines that intersect at a common origin , and between these world - lines a set of intervening world - lines may be constructed through the origin , on each of which the photon path may be drawn as a purely local light cone . by equating this set of world - lines with rotation on the complex plain , it is demonstrated that the photon path between two such connected events draws a line of constant angle to this set of radii .    from this concept ,",
    "a geometrical model is constructed to show the geodesic of the photon as the locus of an equiangular line , or logarithmic spiral , to this set of inertial frames .",
    "this alternative view of the geodesic as a logarithmic spiral can be used to demonstrate some common concepts of sr such as the relativistic doppler effect , time dilation , the twin paradox , and relativistic radar distance , in a more intuitive way to complement the standard textbooks , and emphasis is given to observable differences in measurement between these relativistic relationships and their classical counterparts .",

    "the calculation of this discrepancy must include the effect of the varying flight trajectory projected towards the receiving station on earth , and while it does not have an exact analytical solution , this is comparatively straightforward using computational iteration .",
    "thus a spacecraft in hyperbolic trajectory at a geocentric distance of 21  a.u . and assessed classical velocity of 20  km / s will show a small additional component of acceleration of @xmath112  cm / s / s directed towards the observing station .",
    "this relativistic term appears as an additional geocentric deceleration that must be corrected for .",
    "it should be emphasised that , although this is of a similar magnitude to the unexpected solar - directed acceleration observed with the pioneer craft,@xcite the sr correction distinctively decreases with distance and reducing velocity while the pioneer anomaly was a constant heliocentric acceleration caused by anisotropic emission of thermal radiation from the radioisotope thermoelectric generators ( rtgs).@xcite      a similar effect is shown when an emitting object is approaching the earth , but now the photons are blueshifted ( fig .",

    "again , as described in section  [ section : doppler ] for the relativistic doppler redshift , for a system that is subject to deceleration relative to a receiving station on earth , any phase - shift in the transmissions will occur earlier and the difference between proper and relativistic velocities will decrease with distance .",

    "following einstein s original work in 1905,@xcite our understanding of sr goes back to minkowski@xcite and the four - vector formalism of sommerfeld,@xcite and these form the basis for the geometric interpretation of sr in many contemporary presentations and textbooks .",
    "more recently , computerization has generated detailed images of how the world might appear to a relativistic traveller , and weiskopf has provided a comprehensive review of the current status of visualization in sr , describing three visualization approaches : minkowsi diagrams , spatial slices , and virtual camera models.@xcite minkowski diagrams are the standard way of depicting the spacetime of sr graphically , by representing both temporal and spatial dimensions in a single image .",
    "spacetime events are visualized as points , the world - lines of objects as lines , and reference frames are indicated by their respective coordinate axes .",
    "the light rays emitted by an object and absorbed by the observer form a light cone that is also illustrated by a line , or by a collection of lines to generate a 3d cone rendered as a 2d image .",
    "it is well recognised that problem - solving ability can be improved through the appropriate use of visualization,@xcite and the popularity of minkowski diagrams in textbooks and other scientific representations of sr is rooted in the fact that those diagrams provide a geometric visualization of spacetime . yet although sr has been fully vindicated since its first description by einstein , and the underlying mathematical treatment is complete and self - consistent , the standard minkowski representations have remained unchanged for over 100  years and their concepts remain difficult for some students to visualize.@xcite    this paper presents a novel geometrical picture of sr in which the constancy of @xmath0 to any observer is taken as axiomatic .",
    "this is represented by a geodesic describing a constant angle to a set of diverging reference frames ; the locus of such a line is the logarithmic spiral on the imaginary plane , which is a self - similar curve whose relationships are independent of scale or the angle of rotation .",
    "it must be emphasised that the visualization of the photon path in this model is a mathematical abstraction , and must not be construed as representing the actual location of the photons . in practice",
    ", we can only know the velocity of the emitting frame ( @xmath15 ) at the moment of emission relative to our own frame ( @xmath11 ) at the moment of reception .",
    "the actual position of the photons between these two moments is indeterminate ( as demanded by quantum theory ) , and the path as a logarithmic spiral can only be defined and constructed once the relative velocities at these times is defined and stated .",
    "this geometry , however , is self - consistent , leading naturally to the common mathematical relationships of sr , and this is developed to provide an alternative geometrical representation to the standard minkowski diagrams .",
    "relativistic doppler redshift , radar distance , and the twin paradox are presented as examples of this geometrical approach .",
    "the light cone is shown to have relevance only in the local or `` proper '' frame of reference with `` real '' time , where velocities are given in terms of @xmath172 and therefore can not exceed @xmath50 at the surface of the cone , whereas the velocities of independent inertial frames are defined on the imaginary plain in terms of @xmath173 and may take any angle .",
    "this difference between proper and relativistic velocities is emphasised , and it is shown that , where these velocities are changing , this may be revealed as a small apparent acceleration or deceleration , even in systems not generally thought to be moving at relativistic velocities .",
    "one problem with the logarithmic spiral visualization is the reduction of dimensionality , as only the temporal dimension and one spatial dimension are shown in the diagrams .",
    "however , all approaches have in common a reduction of dimensionality of 4-d spacetime , and minkowski diagrams also never show all four dimensions of spacetime but only a restricted subspace .",
    "another issue is the interpretation of angles since the minkowski metric in imaginary space is different from the euclidean metric , and the hyperbolic functions can not be inferred intuitively from our experience with euclidean space in which the diagram is rendered .",
    "for example , the maximum angle available in the local frame of reference is @xmath174 for the photons ; but for the diverging reference frames , the maximum angle is @xmath175 ; hence the geodesic can spiral round the origin indefinitely as the relative velocity of the frames draws closer to @xmath0 .",
    "also , the length of the photon path is the null geodesic which appears to have finite length on the diagrams , but as weiskopf has stated , this interpretation issue is equally a problem with the standard minkowski diagrams , which assume a mathematical background sufficient to make them intelligible.@xcite    einstein is quoted as saying , `` my ability lies not in mathematical calculation , but rather in visualizing effects , possibilities and consequences'',@xcite and visualization using computer - generated graphics can be a means of finding simplicity in a complex artefact by the selective representation of an appropriate abstraction.@xcite the logarithmic spiral geometry of sr is an alternative visual representation for understanding sr as pure geometry that might complement the standard minkowski diagrams . using computer - generated diagrams to show the photon as an equiangular locus , or logarithmic spiral , is supplementary to minkowski diagrams , and demonstrates how @xmath0 can remain constant to each observer , while simultaneously displaying the classical and relativistic time frames",
    ". this may enable the student to understand the differences between these reference frames , and the consequences of varying the relativistic velocity in a variety of scenarios .",
