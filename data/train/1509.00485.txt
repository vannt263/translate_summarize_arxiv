    "in quantum optics , the degree of coherence plays a crucial role in characterizing different sources of radiation . in particular , the second - order coherence @xmath6 is of central importance because it relates to the statistics of the radiation.@xcite it can be shown that radiation sources whose fluctuations are independent of the optical phase such as lasers , thermal or chaotic light , all lead to @xmath9 .",
    "microscopically , this result can be interpreted as an effect due to the bunching of the photons . on the other hand , a radiation field with @xmath10",
    "indicates that the radiation can not be described in classical terms by a statistical superposition of coherent fields with different intensities .",
    "it is of fundamental interest to find and characterize radiation sources that produce nonclassical light .",
    "an important idea in this respect is to use the fermionic nature of electrons emitting the photons to imprint their antibunched statistics onto the radiation field .",
    "a prime example are single photon sources where a single electron in an excited state of an atom is used to emit a single photon.@xcite an obvious question in this direction is whether there is a quantum limit to the classical light bulb where a resistive wire that is biased with a",
    "_ dc_-voltage is employed to produce photons .",
    "this question has been affirmatively answered:@xcite the idea is to use a quantum point contact biased by a voltage @xmath1 .",
    "single electrons are then transmitted stochastically ( with probability @xmath0 ) through the barrier leading to current fluctuations .",
    "the photons produced by these current fluctuations are nonclassical provided the system is kept at low temperatures @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the elementary charge and @xmath13 the boltzmann constant , such that the electron reservoirs are degenerate and bunching of the photons is suppressed .",
    "the suppression of bunching is achieved by two measures : firstly , only a single channel is allowed to contribute to the transport which requires the breaking of the spin - degeneracy in a magnetic field .",
    "secondly , by engineering of the environment , the photons should be emitted preferentially at frequencies @xmath14 such that each electron that carries an energy less than @xmath15 emits at most a single photon .     and produces current - current fluctuations due to shot and thermal noise .",
    "these fluctuations are filtered by an _ lc_-resonator and transmitted to the detector as electromagnetic - radiation via a transmission line with characteristic impedance @xmath16 . ]",
    "the long - time properties of the radiation emitted by a quantum point contact , such as the fano factor and even arbitrary cumulants of the photon counting statistics , have been obtained both at zero temperature @xcite and at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "based on ideas of ref .",
    ", a detector formed by two resonators at different frequencies has been analyzed in details.@xcite experimental progress has been impressive , resulting in the measurement of high - frequency shot - noise @xcite and the measurement of the two photon interference of photons emitted by a tunnel junction @xcite .",
    "one of the last remaining challenges , the impedance matching of the wave - guides transporting the radiation from the quantum point contact to the amplifier that acts as a detector , has been recently resolved in employing superconducting circuits.@xcite here , we want to study the second - order coherence @xmath6 , which is a time - resolved quantity and thus also carries information about the correlation time of the source . in particular , we show that the behavior of @xmath6 as a function of the autocorrelation time @xmath17 is nonmonotonous with a minimum around @xmath18 .",

    "the _ lc_-resonator is characterized by the resonance frequency @xmath25 and the characteristic impedance @xmath26 , which is the ratio of the voltage to the current in the _ lc_-resonator at the resonance frequency .",

    "<S> shot - noise of electrons that are transmitted with probability @xmath0 through a quantum point contact ( biased at a voltage @xmath1 ) leads to a fluctuating current that in turn emits radiation in the microwave regime . by calculating the fano factor @xmath2 for the case where only a single channel contributes to the transport </S>",
    "<S> , it has been shown that the radiation produced at finite frequency @xmath3 close to @xmath4 and at low temperatures is nonclassical with sub - poissonian statistics ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this effect is the fermionic nature of the electrons producing the radiation , which reduces the probability of simultaneous emission of two or more photons . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fano factor , being a time - averaged quantity , offers only limited information about the system . </S>",
    "<S> here , we calculate the second - order coherence @xmath6 for this source of radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that due to the interference of two contributions , two photon processes ( leading to bunching ) are completely absent at zero temperature for @xmath7 . at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> we find a competition of the contribution due to gaussian current - current fluctuations ( leading to bunching ) with the one due to non - gaussian fluctuations ( leading to antibunching ) . at slightly elevated temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the non - gaussian contribution becomes suppressed whereas the gaussian contributions remain largely independent of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the competition of the two contributions leads to a nonmonotonic behavior of the second - order coherence as a function of time . as a result , @xmath6 obtains a minimal value for times @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> close to this time , the second - order coherence remains below 1 at temperatures where the fano factor is already above 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we identify realistic experimental parameters that can be used to test the sub - poissonian nature of the radiation . </S>"
