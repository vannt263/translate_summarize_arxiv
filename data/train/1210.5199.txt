    "exploiting the merits of heavy quarks is one of the most important and promising tools to probe the strongly interacting partonic medium created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "heavy quarks are mostly created through gluon fusion @xcite , almost exclusively @xcite early in the heavy - ion collision , therefore , they experience all stages of the medium evolution .",
    "also , their masses are external to qcd @xcite and thus are not modified by the presence of the medium .",
    "hence , the kinematics of emerging heavy quarks carry a memory of their interactions with the medium . by comparing the heavy quark production in heavy - ion collisions to the baseline production in @xmath6 and @xmath7+au collisions ,",
    "we seek to further understand the flavor dependence of energy loss in the medium .",
    "azimuthal anistropy of heavy quarks provides further information on the strength of their interaction with the medium , and better discrimination between theoretical models .    in this article",
    "we report on the preliminary results of measuring the production of electrons from heavy flavor semi - leptonic decays , so - called non - photonic electrons ( npe ) .",
    "we show a new high precision measurement of npe production at mid - rapidity in au+au  collisions at @xmath4 gev , then using our previously published @xmath6 measurement @xcite we show an improved nuclear modification factor @xmath8 and compare it to theoretical models .",
    "then we show measurements of npe azimuthal anistropy , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "finally , we show measurements of npe production in au+aucollisions at @xmath5 gev , and @xmath9 measurements at @xmath1 and @xmath2 gev .",
    "in rhic run 2010 , star has sampled nearly 2.6 @xmath12 luminosity of au+aucollisions at @xmath4 gev . minimum bias ( mb ) trigger data is used for low @xmath0   electrons , while high @xmath0  trigger ( ht ) data provides higher statistical precision for @xmath13 2 gev/@xmath14 .",
    "we have also utilized data from an independent @xmath15 centrality trigger .",
    "we use about 1 @xmath12 for the @xmath4 gev  results we show here . during the same rhic run star",
    "has also collected au+aucollision data at @xmath1 and @xmath2 gev , which allows us to search for the onset of heavy quark suppression and flow .    for analyses in all collision energies ,",
    "the most important detector is the star time projection chamber ( tpc ) with large acceptance , which provides tracking and @xmath16 for electrons identification .",
    "hadron rejection is done utilizing time of flight ( tof ) @xcite information at low @xmath0  and the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) @xcite at high @xmath0 .",
    "the bemc is also used for triggering on high @xmath0  electrons .    to extract npe",
    ", we statistically subtract the contribution of photonic electrons ( pe ) from the identified inclusive electrons . by reconstructing the invariant mass of electron pairs",
    "we estimate the pe contribution from gamma conversion , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 dalitz decays .",
    "extracted yield of pe is then corrected by a @xmath0  dependent reconstruction efficiency determined from simulation to be at the level of 30 - 60% .",
    "other non - photonic background sources are electrons from vector mesons di - electron decays ( @xmath19 3 gev/@xmath14 ) , and electrons from heavy quarkonia and drell - yan decays ( @xmath13 2.0 gev/@xmath14 ) . contribution from @xmath20 can be non - negligible in this region , estimates based on measured @xmath20 experimental measurements show it can be as large as 20% of the measured non - photonic electrons .",

    "the large uncertainty from our baseline @xmath26+@xmath26 measurement dominates the current overall uncertainty .",
    "analysis of the large amount of collected high quality data from rhic runs 2009 and 2012 are needed to improve the baseline precision .",
    "however , to exploit the high precision of this measurement , it will be interesting to see theoretical predictions for the quenched invariant yields rather than the @xmath8 only . with the current precision",
    "the predictions from all other energy energy loss models describe the data .",
    "figure [ fig : npe200gev ] lower - right shows npe @xmath27 measurements from 2- and 4- particle correlations and event plane method , represented as @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 in au+au  collisions at @xmath4 gev .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath11 are consistent with each other for @xmath13 3 gev/@xmath14 .",
    "while both show a pronounced systematic increase in @xmath27 towards high @xmath0 , at this point we can not distinguish whether this rise is due to jet - like correlations unrelated to the reaction plane or due to the path length dependence of partonic energy loss .",
    "for @xmath0  @xmath28 gev/@xmath14  we show both @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in @xmath10",
    "the non - flow contribution is negligible and the flow fluctuations contribution is negative , hence providing a lower bound on the @xmath27 of npe .",
    "both @xmath27 measurements are finite , which indicates a strong charm - medium interaction at @xmath4 gev .    to provide more experimental discrimination power for theoretical models star is extending its npe program to lower energies . the quest is to see if the energy loss of heavy quarks is lessened or turned off at lower energies .",
    "figure [ fig : spec62 ] shows npe invariant yield in au+au  collisions at @xmath5 gev  together with a scaled fonll prediction . while a previous @xmath26+@xmath26 measurement at the isr @xcite seems to agree with fonll upper - band , our measurement is systematically higher than both .",
    "measurement of @xmath9 at lower energies shown in figure [ fig : v2_low_energy ] seem to be consistent within errors with that at @xmath4 gev  for @xmath29 gev/@xmath14 .",
    "the results for data points at @xmath30 gev/@xmath14  seem to hint at a milder charm - medium interaction compared to those at @xmath4 gev .",
    "in this article we reported on star new preliminary results of non - photonic electron measurements .",
    "the new npe measurements in @xmath4 gev  collisions are precise in a broad @xmath0  region .",
    "npe nuclear modification factor measurement show a large suppression of npe production in central au+au  collisions .",
    "we observe large npe @xmath27 at low @xmath0  which indicate a strong charm - medium interaction .",
    "the @xmath27 increases towards higher @xmath0  ( @xmath31 gev/@xmath14 ) is possibly due to jet - correlations unrelated to the reaction plane and/or due to path - length dependence of heavy quark energy loss .    at lower energies we reported on measurement of npe invariant yield in au+au  collisions at @xmath5 gev  which is systematically higher than a fonll prediction .",
    "we have also presented our results of azimuthal anistropy at @xmath1 and @xmath2 gev by measuring @xmath9 which for @xmath30 gev/@xmath14  seem to hint at a milder charm - medium interaction than at @xmath4 gev .",
