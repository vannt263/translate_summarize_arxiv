    "similarly , the last line is obtained by fourier transforming the weyl functions in the integrand of the first line .",
    "the first and third forms ( and the second and fourth ) show us that @xmath46 this scaling law reflects a duality between wigner functions and weyl characteristic functions .",
    "this duality is related to sub - planck structures of the wigner functions  @xcite . for a given input state",

    "these two scales are related by an uncertainty relation , @xmath49 . since the weyl characteristic function is the fourier transform of the wigner function , these two scales appear inversely in the weyl function .",
    "the scaling law  ( [ scaling ] ) displays this duality . if we look at the fidelity in the form of the second relation in eq .",
    "( [ fideloverlap ] ) , we see that the fidelity between the input state and the output state approaches unity if the dispersion of the gaussian channel satisfies @xmath50 so that the integral approaches @xmath51 , which is 1 for a pure state ; in this case , all the small - scale phase - space structure of the wigner function is well transmitted through the noisy channel . the dual form of the fidelity , expressed in the the last relation of eq .",
    "( [ fideloverlap ] ) , says that to get good fidelity , we need to have @xmath52 , so that the integral reduces to the square of the integral over the entire wigner function .",

    "( [ fideloverlap ] ) : @xmath55 the task can be restated as finding the pure state that maximizes this overlap .    notice that this fidelity can be thought of as the average value of @xmath56 with respect to a pure product copy state , @xmath57 , of two modes ,",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 ; the joint wigner function of the two modes is @xmath60 . introducing modes @xmath61 and @xmath62 , with annihilation operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 and corresponding c - number variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 , we can rewrite the fidelity as @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",

    "thus we can write the fidelity as @xmath74 where @xmath75    notice that @xmath76 , confirming that the fidelity is 1 regardless of the input state for @xmath77 .",
    "generally we can bound the fidelity by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath69 : @xmath78 the reason this is the largest eigenvalue is that the factor in large parentheses in the expression for @xmath69 has magnitude @xmath79 , which means that the largest eigenvalue , corresponding to the vacuum state for mode  @xmath62 , is @xmath80 .",
    "since coherent states saturate the upper bound , we can write @xmath81    the bound on the expectation value of @xmath69 is useful in other applications than the noisy gaussian channels considered here . for that purpose ,",

    ", it holds for the expectation value @xmath83not just for the pure product copy states that are relevant to the channel fidelity .",
    "a joint state achieves the expectation value bound if and only if mode @xmath62 is in vacuum ; i.e. , the state @xmath82 is the state of the two output modes , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , of a 50:50 beamsplitter that has vacuum incident on its mode-@xmath62 input .",

    "[ sec : fidelitymixed ] we introduced the entanglement fidelity and the mean ensemble fidelity as fidelity measures to characterize these situations .",
    "we note that since the mean ensemble fidelity  ( [ ensfidel ] ) is an average of pure - state fidelities , it satisfies the scaling law  ( [ scaling ] ) and the upper bound  ( [ boundfidel ] ) .",
    "moreover , since the entanglement fidelity is bounded above by the mean ensemble fidelity , we can write generally that @xmath110 for any ensemble that corresponds to the input state @xmath1 .    in this section",
