    "<S> it is shown that two linearly polarized waves , namely the fast and alfvn modes in the low-@xmath2 @xmath3 plasmas , the fast and slow modes in the @xmath4 plasmas , and the alfvn and slow modes in the high-@xmath5 @xmath6 plasmas , become circularly polarized at the near - parallel ( to @xmath0 ) propagation . </S>",
    "<S> the negative magnetic - helicity of the alfvn mode occurs only at small or moderate angles in the low-@xmath1 plasmas , and the ion cross - helicity of the slow mode is nearly the same as that of the alfvn mode in the high-@xmath1 plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> it also shown the electric polarization @xmath7  decreases with the temperature ratio @xmath8  for the long - wavelength waves , and the transition between left- and right - hand polarizations of the alfvn mode in @xmath9  plasmas can disappear when @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the approximate dispersion relations in the near - perpendicular propagation , low-@xmath1 , and high-@xmath1 limits can quite accurately describe the three modes . </S>"
