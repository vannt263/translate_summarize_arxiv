    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations and the development of new powerful high - resolution spectrographs at large ground - based telescopes demonstrate that gcs do not consist of stars of a single age and metallicity ( see the review paper by gratton et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to stars having a chemical composition similar to that of the galactic halo , gcs contain stars built of the matter that has passed through the full @xmath8-cycle and proton capture of light nuclei .",
    "contrary to the field stars , they often show sodium - oxygen anti - correlations ( gratton et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ) .",
    "anomalies of chemical and stellar composition are found for many galactic gcs .",
    "explaining the origin and chemical evolution of stars in gcs is very important for understanding the processes of nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution in the early universe .",
    "although deep stellar photometry is available for many galactic gcs thanks to hst high - resolution images , high resolution spectroscopy in a wide spectral range for many faint stars in gcs is still very expensive .",
    "this is why we decided to explore the possibility of studying the detailed chemical composition in gcs using medium - resolution spectra . in the present paper ,",
    "we fit medium - resolution spectra of ngc2419 integrated along different slit positions with stellar atmosphere models taking into account the stellar mass function .",
    "ngc2419 is a unique massive gc ( @xmath9 ) in the outer galactic halo , at a distance of 84 kpc .",
    "its large half - light radius ( @xmath10 pc , ibata et al . ,",
    "2011 ) is similar to that of ultra - compact dwarf galaxies .",
    "the stellar content and mass function , the chemical composition and the structure of ngc  2419 have been studied actively . the blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) of the cluster is very extended ( di criscienzo et al .",

    "an unusually high mass - to - luminosity ( m / l ) and the possible presence of a black hole in the center of the cluster were suggested by investigators of its stellar dynamics ( ibata 2011a , b ) .",
    "measurements of stellar velocities at higher spectral resolution ( baumgardt et al . , 2009 )",
    "did not favor the last hypothesis .",

    "the unusual chemical composition and other properties of the cluster were interpreted as a signature of its possible extragalactic origin .    in this paper",
    "we carry out population synthesis modeling of medium - resolution spectra of ngc2419 .",
    "our main aim was to obtain theoretical spectra in good agreement with the observed ones .",
    "this task is solved for the first time .",
    "the lowest resolution used in the literature for such a task was @xmath12 ( colucci et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "at variance with the population systhesis modeling of schiavon et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we use theoretical spectra of stars calculated using stellar atmosphere models .",

    "our conclusions are formulated in section 6 .",
    "medium - resolution long slit ( @xmath14 ) spectra of ngc  2419 were obtained with the spectrograph carelec ( lemaitre et al .",

    "note that our observing program also included other distant galactic gcs .",
    "separate papers will be devoted to their spectroscopic analysis .",
    "data reduction and analysis were carried out using midas ( european southern observatory munich image data analysis system ) ( banse et al . , 1983 ) and iraf ( image reduction and analysis facility ) . cosmic - ray rejection was made using the program _",

    "a map of hot pixels was prepared prior to the masking process .",
    "the accuracy of the dispersion solution obtained using the he - ne lamp is @xmath21 .",
    "possible systematic uncertainties may arise due to differences in optical paths from the lamp to the spectrograph and from a position on the sky to the spectrograph .",

    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted using the procedure _ apsum _ in iraf .",
    "this program allows one to correct the curvature of spectra along the dispersion , which may arise due to a slight slope of the slit , or as a result of the influence of atmosphere dispersion if the slit position angle has a large parallactic angle ( pa > > 0 ) .",

    "modeling the gc integrated light was based on synthetic spectra for stars with physical parameters corresponding to the selected isochrone .",
    "we use isochrones of bertelli et al .",

    "after initialization of a specified isochrone , its optimization was carried out to reduce the amount of calculations .",
    "for the stars ( places of isochrones ) which contribute less than @xmath28 to the cluster light we use the following maximum steps of temperature and surface gravity : @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for",
    "the other points the steps were twice as large .",
    "the places of isochrones with the initial stellar masses which contribute less than @xmath31 to the cluster mass were excluded from the calculations .",
    "finally the resulting isochrones contained 55 - 65 points .",
    "so possible errors of modeling caused by the optimization procedure were reduced to @xmath32 of the continuum flux .",
    "we used a modified @xmath33 package ( shimansky et al . , 2003 ) for calculating synthetic blanketed spectra of stellar atmospheres .",
    "plane - parallel , hydrostatic stellar atmosphere models for a given initial set of parameters ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) were obtained by interpolation of a model grid of castelli & kurucz ( 2004 ) using a method described in suleimanov ( 1996 ) .",
    "we used _ the solar _ chemical composition and isotopic abundance of some chemical elements ( anders & grevesse , 1989 ) .    for each stellar atmosphere we derived fluxes propagating in three basic directions with angles to the stellar surface",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "then the stellar surface was divided into sectors with a step of @xmath40 for all orienting angles .",

    "the radiation intensity of the sector reaching an observer was found by interpolation of the specific intensities in the three basic angles according to the actual visibility angle .",
    "the integrated stellar radiation was obtained by integration of the radiation from each sector according to the area and local radial velocities caused by the rotation of the star and radial tangential macro - turbulence .",
    "finally , the obtained spectra were broadened according to the instrumental spectral - line profile of the spectrograph , using a gaussian function with a half - width corresponding to the resolution .    before normalization , spectra with and without atomic lines and molecular bands",
    "were calculated simultaneously in the spectral range @xmath41@xmath42 .",
    "modeling the spectra with different wavelength steps @xmath43 has shown that @xmath44  is the maximum value when errors in the line profiles are less than @xmath32 of the continuum flux .",
    "we took into account all sources of continuous opacity tabulated in the packages @xmath45 ( suleimanov , 1992 ) and @xmath33 ( sakhibullin & shimansky , 1997 ) , approximately 570000 atomic lines from the list of kurucz ( 1994 ) and 28 molecular bands in the optical spectral range calculated according to the theory of nersisyan et al .",
    "( 1989 ) kindly provided by ya.v .",
    "we used the empirical oscillator strengths calculated by shimansky ( 2011 ) for the 750 most intense lines .",

    "therefore we included calculation of the opacities for 75000 molecular bands @xmath49 and @xmath50 from the catalogs of kurucz ( 1994 ) in the package @xmath33 .",
    "modeling of the balmer - line profiles was done using of the stark broadening theories of vidal , cooper & smith ( 1973 ) and griem ( 1960 ) . for the other lines we calculated the standard voigt profile taking into account the following information : doppler broadening of lines due to thermal motion of atoms , microturbulent velocity @xmath51 , natural damping , stark broadening according to the approximation of kurucz & furenlid ( 1979 ) and the van der waals broadening constants defined using the classical formula unsold ( 1955 ) with the the scaling factor in the range @xmath52@xmath53 ( shimansky , 2011 ) .",

    "( 2008 ) for binary stellar systems .",
    "the non - lte atomic populations for each atmosphere model were calculated using the linearization method by auer & heasley ( 1976 ) with the package @xmath54 of sakhibullin ( 1983 ) .",

    "the influence of non - lte effects on line profiles for different chemical elements in the summed spectrum of ngc  2419 is shown in fig.1 for the physical parameters and chemical composition obtained by us ( see sec .  4 ) .",
    "note that non - lte effects do not affect the hi line intensities ( increase by @xmath69 of the central line depth ) due to the dominance of hi in almost all stellar atmospheres of the cluster .",
    "lines of heavy elements are enhanced with very different amplitudes taking into account non - lte effects .",
    "the intensity of the resonance doublet @xmath70grows a lot ( up to @xmath71 of the central depth ) . as a result ,",
    "the sodium abundance is reduced by @xmath72 dex .",
    "the non - blended resonance line @xmath73  is significantly influenced by non - lte effects ( up to @xmath74 of the central depth ) . on the other hand , the lines @xmath60 and @xmath62 do not change .",
    "unfortunately , we have no near - ir spectra containing the lines @xmath75 , @xmath76 having significant non - lte corrections .",
    "the calculated spectra for stars belonging to the selected isochrone were summed according to their radii and initial mass function @xmath77 . in this work the chabrier ( 2005 )",
    "initial mass function ( imf ) was used    @xmath78    @xmath79    where @xmath80 .",
    "it gives a good approximation of the stellar luminosity function ( lf ) found in the literature for ngc 2419 ( bellazzini et al .",
    "the chabrier imf matches well the theoretical mass distributions of padoan & nordlund ( 2004 ) for lowest mass stars .",
    "finally , normalization of the integrated spectrum was done by division of the spectrum with its lines and molecular bands by the corresponding continuum .",
    "the isochrone used for the cluster is defined by its parameters ( age @xmath25 , helium abundance @xmath27 and metallicity @xmath26 ) , where @xmath81 corresponds to the hydrogen abundance , @xmath27 stands for the helium abundance , and @xmath26 means the heavier elements abundance .",
    "the values for the sun are @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( anders & grevesse , 1989 ) ] which may be derived by comparison of the observed and theoretical spectra .",

    "note that chemical elements synthesized in deep stellar layers of some red giant and blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars may be delivered to the surface and change the initial chemical composition ( e.g. smiljanic et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "however , our analysis shows that an upper limit for the contribution of these stars to the total flux in the spectral range @xmath88@xmath42  is only @xmath89 .",
    "we show in fig .  2 the contribution of different parts of the isochrone to the total spectrum .",
    "if we assume that chemical anomalies due to the mixing effect do not exceed @xmath90 dex , the errors @xmath91 are @xmath92 ( pereira et al . , 2011 ) and",
    "the determined abundances of chemical elements for the cluster are close to their initial values .",
    "we derive @xmath27 and @xmath26 as follows .",
    "we vary them until the theoretical profiles for the lines @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 fit the observed ones , because the @xmath27 content influences the shape of the balmer lines .",
    "additionally , it is important to ensure that the theoretical profiles for the lines @xmath96  and @xmath97  fit well the observed ones for a given ca content .",
    "if the ionization balance between @xmath98 and @xmath99 is reached , our calculations are considered to be near completion . in fig .  2 ( a ) we present isochrones for different ages and @xmath27 .",
    "the best - fit age and he abundance for ngc  2419 are @xmath100 and @xmath101 . in fig .  2 ( b ) we show the theoretical line profiles @xmath93 and",
    "@xmath95 compared to the observed ones . when reducing the age , the temperature of stars increases , and the main sequence turn - off point ( msto ) gets bluer .",
    "this leads to an increased contribution of early - type main sequence @xmath102-dwarfs to the integrated light of the cluster .",
    "these stars have strong balmer lines . as a result of reducing the age ,",
    "all @xmath103 lines appear to be more intense simultaneously in the doppler cores and in the wings . on the other hand ,",
    "increasing the he abundance does not influence strongly the shape of the isochrone ( position of the main sequence , sub - giant and giant branches ) but it increases the luminosity of hot hb stars . it is known that the doppler cores of the balmer lines are deep in the spectra of such stars , because gas pressure is not strong in their atmospheres . therefore",
    ", increasing @xmath27 leads to a sharp increase of the central intensities of the balmer lines and a weakening of their wings .",
    "note that @xmath95 increases less than @xmath93 ( see fig .  2 ( b ) ) . in summary , @xmath25 and @xmath27 influence",
    "differently the @xmath103 line profiles , and this fact allows us to disentangle these two parameters .",

    "we determined the mean chemical abundances in stellar atmospheres in a regular way by fitting the observed line profiles with theoretical ones .",

    "we found that molecular bands @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 lines are some of the most prominent features in the spectrum of ngc  2419 . to derive abundances of other chemical elements it was necessary to analyze blends of many lines . finally , we managed to estimate abundances of 14 elements including 3 alpha - elements ( ca , o , mg ) and ti .",
    "we obtained age=12.6 gyr , [ fe / h]@xmath169 dex , @xmath101 and [ @xmath5/fe]@xmath170 as the mean of @xmath1 $ ] , @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] . the derived chemical composition ( except for the alpha - elements )",
    "agrees well with the published one , which was obtained using high - resolution spectra for 8 rgb stars of the cluster ( cohen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , shetrone et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ) , and confirms the conclusion about the chemical peculiarity of ngc  2419 .",
    "the abundance of mg ( @xmath2=-0.05 \\pm 0.15 $ ] ) derived by us agrees within the errors with a mean value for 49 rgb stars obtained by mucciarelli et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ( @xmath2=0.05 \\pm 0.08 $ ] ) using high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the method presented here employs information from all the stars in the cluster , and may be successfully applied to integrated - light spectroscopic studies of extragalactic gcs .",
    "it is still impossible to obtain deep @xmath171 , or high - resolution , high @xmath164 spectra for such objects . in these cases , an initial approximation for the age",
    "may be derived using lick indices , or full spectral fitting using simple stellar population models ( see e.g. sharina et al .",
