    "during the first decade of the twentieth century , observations of variable stars from the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) galaxy taken with the 24-inch bruce telescope at harvard boyden station in arequipa , peru , conducted to henrietta leavitt to make an important discovery : the correlation between the logarithm of the pulsation periods of cepheid variables and their magnitudes @xcite . in honour of its discoverer , this correlation , commonly called period - luminosity ( pl ) relation , has been renamed recently as the leavitt law ( ll ) @xcite .",
    "originally , the size of the sample used by leavitt to establish the pl relation was statistically small : only 25 cepheids .",
    "thirteen years later , the number of smc cepheids used to establish the pl relation increased by more than a factor of four @xcite . more recently , microlensing projects , as the massive compact halo objects ( macho ) and the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) , discovered hundreds of cepheids , as a result of monitoring systematically the bars of the magellanic clouds . based on these observations",
    ", it was possible to determine , with high precision , periods and mean _ vi _ magnitudes of cepheids , and the slope and zero - point values of the ll for the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) galaxy @xcite .",
    "these advances confirmed the ll as an useful modern tool to determine extragalactic distances , tied to an assumed lmc distance modulus of @xmath1 mag @xcite , as shown by several studies in the last years , but in particular through the work of the araucaria project by measuring distances to selected galaxies of the local group and the sculptor group ( @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "+ in order to measure distances at galaxies through the ll , two important hypotheses have to be adopted : its universality and linearity .",
    "universality means that the slope of the ll is independent ( or weakly dependent ) on metallicity , implying that this value in a photometric band is the same for all galaxies .",
    "linearity means that there is a linear correlation between mean magnitudes and the logarithm of the pulsation periods of cepheids .",
    "+ the influence of metallicity on the pl relation has been discussed by several groups . studying some selected galaxies , @xcite and @xcite found strong evidence in favour of the universal slope of the pl relation in optical bands , between the metallicity range of @xmath2 dex ( ic1613 ) up to @xmath3 dex ( lmc ) . @xcite and @xcite showed that the use of the wesenheit index , @xmath4 , minimises not only the effects of reddening but also those of metallicity on the pl relations . @xcite and @xcite showed that the slopes of the pl relations in _ vi_-bands and in the @xmath5 index do not change significantly in the milky way and lmc galaxies . +",
    "although the universality and linearity of the pl relation have been assumed in distance determination studies , there are works showing that these hypotheses are not always truthful . with respect to the non - universality , @xcite , using the infrared surface brightness technique , found that the slopes and zero points of the pl relations of the lmc and milky way present a significant dependence on metallicity in the wesenheit index , a weak dependence on metallicity in the optical _ vi_-bands , and do not present any dependence on metallicity in @xmath6-band .",
    "+ with respect to non - linearity , the russian astronomer boris kukarkin found in the thirties that the pl relations of external galaxies present a break around @xmath7 days , as it was mentioned by @xcite and references therein .",
    "@xcite found a break of the period - colour ( pc ) relation at @xmath7 days in the lmc galaxy .",
    "@xcite confirmed these break based on the statistical @xmath8-test . + from a study of the lmc cepheids , @xcite detected non - linearity of the ll .",
    "this was found when using the testimator method , that determines if there is a slope change in a @xmath9 subset with respect to a smoothed slope obtained in all previous subsets .",
    "the smoothing process is applied in order to avoid the outliers influence on the slopes computed . applying this method",
    ", those authors detected a significant change in the slope between subsets of period around @xmath7 days .",
    "+ @xcite presented a study of non - linearity of the pl relation and the period - luminosity - colour ( plc ) relation using two non - parametric methods : linear regression residuals and additive models .",
    "these authors found again that the pl relation is non - linear and presents a break around @xmath7 days .",
    "possible causes for the non - linearity of the ll were suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ @xcite studied the pl relation at individual phases of the pulsation cycle of cepheids ( the multi - phase approach ) and found again a break around @xmath7 days .",
    "they showed that the behaviour of the ll at mean light is the average of the behaviour at all phases .",
    "this result reinforce the use of the pl relation at mean light in the distance determination context .",
    "readers interested in more details of these statistical methods are referred to the papers cited above .",
    "+   + despite the results of these studies , universality and linearity of the ll remain to be adopted .",
    "the slope and zero point of the ll in optical _",
    "vi_-bands have been established with a high degree of accuracy from fundamental - mode cepheids in the lmc galaxy by @xcite . when the ordinary least - squares ( ols ) regression was applied to ogle - ii data of cepheids , over a range of @xmath10 from @xmath11 up to @xmath12 for the lmc , and from @xmath11 up to @xmath13 for the smc , udalski realised that the standard deviation of the residuals of the lmc data was almost two times smaller than that of the smc .",
    "despite that the number of cepheids in the smc doubles that of the lmc , the greater dispersion of the smc pl relation is caused by the spatial distribution of cepheids in the galaxy bar , whose thickness is placed along the line - of - sight with a typical depth of @xmath14 mag @xcite .",
    "this fact , and the manner in which the pl relation of the lmc populates for periods greater than @xmath15 days , led to adopt the lmc slope value as a universal quantity @xcite .",
    "+   + these facts and results we have mentioned above , motivate some questions behind this paper : what is the slope of the ll from a larger sample of cepheids ? more specifically , what is the slope if the cepheids in the lmc and smc are considered as a single sample ? +   + in order to test the universality and linearity hypotheses of the ll and answer the previous questions , this paper is structured as follows : a description of ogle - ii cepheid data of the magellanic clouds is presented in the second section .",
    "the extension of the ols regression , that we develop to calculate the slope of the ll from cepheids in the magellanic clouds simultaneously , is found in the third section .",
    "tests of universality and linearity of the ll , as also our main results and a discussion of them , are presented in the fourth section .",
    "finally , our main conclusions are given in the fifth section .",
    "in a study of the pl relation in optical bands using lmc ogle - iii fundamental - mode cepheids , @xcite found a discrepancy in the slopes computed by them and those reported by other authors , due to the different number of cepheids used in each study .",
    "for this reason , to avoid effects of the sample size , in our study we use ogle - ii data to establish a direct comparison between our slopes and those obtained by @xcite , that remain as the accepted universal values .",
    "+ the ogle ii photometric data for the magellanic clouds were obtained between 1997 and 1999 , ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "high quality _ bvi _ observations of hundreds of variable stars along the galaxies bars were collected with the @xmath16-m warsaw telescope , at las campanas observatory , chile @xcite .",
    "a number of epochs between 120 to 360 was obtained in the _ i_-band and between 15 to 40 in the _",
    "bv_-bands . a search for periodicity in the photometric time - series of the stars",
    "was made , using the analysis of variance algorithm @xcite .",
    "the cepheid variables were selected based on visual inspection of their light curves and their location on the colour - magnitude diagram @xcite . to select fundamental - mode cepheids , an analysis of fourier coefficients was performed .",
    "+ from the ogle - ii on - line archive we select a number of 745 and 1287 fundamental - mode cepheids , belonging to the lmc and smc , respectively .",
    "their dereddened mean magnitudes were computed once the extinction effect was measured ( @xcite , @xcite ) . to compute the @xmath17 extinction coefficient , it was determined the @xmath18-band magnitude of red clump stars in many lines - of - sight .",
    "differences of the observed @xmath18-band magnitude of red clump stars were assumed as differences in the @xmath17 extinction coefficient . to compute the colour excess @xmath19 and the extinction coefficient @xmath20 in each line - of - sight , they adopted the reddening law of @xcite .",
    "to test the universality and linearity hypotheses of the ll we are interested in obtaining the slopes of the pl relations in optical bands without adopting the values of the slopes reported by @xcite . with this purpose ,",
    "we apply two different approaches of linear fits : the ols regression and the multiple least - squares ( mls ) regression , that is an extension of the ols regression developed by us .",
    "the mls regression is a similar approach to the testimator method described in the introduction section , but with these method we want to find the slope of the pl relation when the mathematical union of data sets of cepheids from different galaxies is used , under the hypotheses that all data sets share the same slope ( universality hypothesis ) , but each one has a different zero point . + before presenting the mls regression , we briefly recall how the ols regression works , emphasising on some useful results .",
    "@xcite stated that the ols regression should be used to predict the value of one variable from the measurement of another , under the following conditions : + ( i ) the nature of the linear regression scatter is not understood , and this scatter is always greater than the errors of the measured variables .",
    "+ ( ii ) it is well established that one variable is the cause and the other is the effect . + as a first approximation , this is the case of the ll : we want to predict the mean magnitudes of cepheids from their measured periods . to do this , it is necessary to use the ols regression over a set of @xmath21 cepheids , each one of them characterised by two variables : @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where the @xmath24 sub - index takes values between @xmath25 to @xmath21 .",
    "the logarithm of the cepheid period is @xmath22 , and in the context of this study , @xmath23 is the dereddened mean magnitude in a photometric band .",
    "the residuals of the measurements of dereddened mean magnitudes , @xmath26 , are defined as the square of the differences between the observed values of these mean magnitudes and the values predicted by the ols regression , as follows : @xmath27 the standard deviation of the residuals is given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the sum of the residuals @xmath26 .",
    "the expressions of the zero point , @xmath30 , and the slope , @xmath31 , can be found by minimising @xmath26 . the well know",

    "we want to find an analytical expression for the slope of the pl relation resulting from the mathematical union of cepheid data of all @xmath38 galaxies , under the assumption that all data sets share the same slope @xmath31 .",
    "we call this value the common slope",
    ". we also want to find the analytical expression for the zero point @xmath40 corresponding to each galaxy , under the assumption that each galaxy is at a different distance . for the @xmath41 galaxy",
    ", the pl relation can be described as : @xmath42 @xmath43 is the predicted dereddened mean magnitude of the @xmath44 cepheid belonging to the @xmath41 galaxy , from its measured period @xmath45 . in analogy with equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , we define the residuals of the measurements of dereddened mean magnitudes for the @xmath41 galaxy , as : @xmath46 we also define the sum of the residuals for all galaxies as : @xmath47 to find the values of the common slope @xmath31 and the zero points @xmath40 , @xmath48 must be minimised with respect to each one of the @xmath49 variables ( @xmath50 ) : @xmath51 by solving these equations , the expression for the zero points @xmath40 of each galaxy is obtained as : @xmath52 which is a similar expression to the equation ( [ eq1b ] ) , given by the ols regression , but with @xmath31 being the common slope which is independent of the zero points and that is given by the following equation : + @xmath53 where @xmath54 the equations ( [ eq1b ] ) and ( [ eq1c ] ) can be obtained of the equations ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) considering a unitary set of galaxies . in the case of the mls regression",
    "it is possible to obtain an expression for the standard deviation of the residuals generalising the equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , taking into account that it is necessary to include the data points of all pl relations .",

    "the ols regression allows to obtain the slope and zero point of the pl relation of a single galaxy . by applying this method to the smc , an increasing of the dispersion of the pl relation caused by the distribution of the cepheids along the galaxy bar",
    "is noted . in order to obtain simultaneously the slope and zero points of the pl relations using the lmc and smc cepheids , and damping the effect of the dispersion caused by the smc cepheids",

    "this method allows us to test the universality of the ll in @xmath0-bands making a study different to the traditional ones : we want to establish if the slopes obtained from the @xmath61 set are consistent with the slopes reported by @xcite for the lmc galaxy , despite of the metallicity differences of the magellanic clouds .",
    "before applying the mls regression to the observational data , we perform some tests of the mls regression over simulated data sets in order to find the common slope and the zero points of each set and verify the validity of the results of this regression method .",
    "first , ten sets of pl relations , each one with 10000 data points , are randomly generated .",
    "each data set has a different zero point and the same slope .",

    "we do not observe trends in the residuals of the mean magnitudes with respect to @xmath62 .",
    "finally , we increase the number of sampling points by one order of magnitude .",
    "as expected , we observe a corresponding decrease of the standard deviations of slopes and zero points , as well as in the dispersion of the residuals of the mean magnitudes . as the mls regression works properly with synthetic data , we apply it to the observational data sets of cepheids in the magellanic clouds .",

    "these facts indicate that the ll is universal in the @xmath0-bands but not in the @xmath5 index .",

    "[ fig3 ] , it is seen that the bigger is the period range used to derive the slope of the pl relation , the smaller is the effect of non - linearity .",
    "for example , in v - band the deviation of the slope obtained with mls regression from the value of @xmath103 , in the period range from @xmath15 to @xmath7 days , is @xmath109 , while for a period range from @xmath15 to @xmath110 days , is @xmath111 .",
    "+ the slopes of the pl relation calculated by @xcite were obtained with cepheids up to @xmath112 days ( lmc ) and @xmath113 days ( smc ) , for which the effect of non - linearity obtained in the present work is in the order of one sigma in v - band . based on these facts our results",
    "reinforce the use of the ll to determine distances , independently of the non - linearity and the break of the pl relation .",
    "+ it can be seen from table [ tab2 ] that the values of the asymptotes @xmath103 for the @xmath61 set , in @xmath0-bands , agree in less than @xmath96 with the values for the slopes of the pl relations found by @xcite ( see table [ tab3 ] , fourth and fifth columns ) .",
    "the @xmath103 values obtained for the lmc and smc are consistent with the values of @xmath31 published by @xcite , up to @xmath114 for the @xmath91-band , and @xmath115 for the @xmath18-band .",
    "also , it can be seen from table [ tab2 ] a statistically significant difference between the @xmath103 values of the lmc and smc in the @xmath5 index , and also between the @xmath103 value of each galaxy with the @xmath31 value published by @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the slope @xmath103 can be considered as universal in @xmath0-bands but not in the @xmath5 index . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will be applying the ols and mls regressions in galaxies other than the magellanic clouds , in order to test the universality and linearity of the ll in these metallicity environments .",
    "in this work we test the universality and linearity hypotheses of the ll , using the sample of cepheids belonging to the magellanic clouds , observed in @xmath0-bands by the ogle - ii project . in order to develop these tests",
    ", we compute the slope values of the ll using two different approaches . one of them makes a mathematical union of the cepheid data of the lmc and smc galaxies to find a common slope applying the mls regression .",
    "the other one obtains the slope of the pl relation applying the ols regression on a single galaxy : the lmc or the smc .",
    "+ the test of the universality hypothesis lead us to obtain a common slope for the @xmath61 set using the mls regression .",
    "our values are consistent with the reported by @xcite for the lmc at a level of @xmath96 and @xmath97 in @xmath116 and @xmath117bands , respectively , and inconsistent in the @xmath5 index .",
    "our results suggest a strong dependence on metallicity of the slope for the @xmath5 index , and a weak dependence on metallicity in the optical _ vi_-bands , in agreement with the results reported by @xcite , reaffirming the universality of the ll in the @xmath0-bands and showing again its non - universality in the @xmath5 index .",
    "+ the test of the linearity hypothesis lead us to find that the values of the slopes of the ll behave exponentially as the range of periods increases , giving clear evidence of non - linearity .",
    "in particular , we find that the lmc ll presents a break around @xmath7 days , according to the results reported by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . a clear explanation of the behaviour of the lmc pl relation , in the range of short - periods is unknown until now .",
    "our result about the non - linearity of the ll is in concordance with the corresponding non - linearity of the lmc pc relation , reported by @xcite and @xcite , and suggests that in the @xmath5 index the pc relation should be non - universal .",
    "+ despite of the non - linearity of the ll , we find that the asymptote @xmath103 has values in @xmath0-bands that are consistent with the slopes reported by @xcite for the lmc , but inconsistent in the @xmath5 index ; therefore , in @xmath0-bands , @xmath103 can be considered as universal and the lmc slopes given by @xcite remain appropriate to measure extragalactic distances .",
    "however , it is necessary to take into account that the universality of the ll has been tested only in a few galaxies ; therefore it will be necessary to study the pl relation in many galaxies other than the magellanic clouds , in order to test the universality of the ll in different metallicity environments .",
