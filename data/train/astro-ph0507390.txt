    "there has been a lot of interest in the study of the reaction rate and their astrophysical relevance@xcite . in the interior of neutron stars ,",
    "the semi - leptonic reaction is devoted to the cooling of stars while the non - leptonic one to the damping of instability of rapidly rotating stars .",
    "we here concern about the non - leptonic process .",
    "the previous work@xcite were carried out under the usual situation of zero magnetic field . however , the strength of the surface magnetic field of a pulsar is typically of order @xmath4 which concluded from the observation data .",
    "some magnetars are observed to have magnetic field of @xmath5 .",
    "considering the flux throughout the stars as a simple trapped primordial flux , the internal magnetic field may go up to @xmath6 or even more @xcite . in spite of the fact that we do not know yet any appropriate mechanism to produce more intense field",
    ", the scalar viral theorem indeed allows the field magnitude to be as large as @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , it is advisable to study the effect of the magnetic field on strange quark matter including the calculation of the rate of the reactions .",
    "the quark urca process have been discussed in a few of works@xcite.here we focus on the non - leptonic process leading to bulk viscosity in strange quark matter .",
    "@xmath8    in magnetic fields , a classical charged particle will have a transverse cycle motion .",
    "in quantum mechanism , the transverse motion is quantized into landau levels .",
    "the quantization effect is important when the magnetic strength is equal or larger than the critical value @xmath9 defined by equating the cyclotron energy @xmath10 to @xmath11 . where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denoted the mass and charge(absolute value)of the particle @xcite .",
    "@xmath14,@xmath15 and @xmath16 denotes the planck constant and boltzman constant and velocity of light respectively , which are taken to be units below.we have considered a wide range of magnetic fields in our study , from `` low '' to `` very high '' magnetic fields(@xmath17)called respectively `` weak '' and `` strong '' field . since u - quark mass in magnitude of order is smaller than d - quark and s - quark , we assume quantization effect on u - quark is important but that of other flavors are negligible@xcite . in the weak field strength situation",
    ", we deal with the calculation of the rate through some approximations : ( i)the unaffected matrix element ; ( ii)the approximating free - particle motion direction . in degeneracy , the strong magnetic fields , i.e .",
    "@xmath18 , force u - quark to occupy the lowest landau ground state , where @xmath19 is the fermi momentum , we should use the exact solution of dirac equation in magnetic field to evaluate the reaction rate .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we solve the the dirac equation in part2 .",
    "we consider the case of weak field in section 3 . and then give the reaction rate in strong field in section 4 .",
    "finally , the results are discussed and a summery is made in section 5 .",
    "we first solve dirac equation in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath20.let the uniform magnetic field @xmath20 along the z - axis , and we choose the asymmetric @xmath21 @xmath22 so that the four - dimensional polarized wave function can be expressed in term of stationary states in the normalization volume @xmath23 . in the magnetic field , the u - quark wave function for fermions ultra - relativistically reads @xmath24}{\\sqrt{2e(e+m)l_y l_z}}\\left ( \\begin{array}{ccc}(e+m)i_{\\nu ; p_z}(x)\\\\ 0\\\\   p_z i_{\\nu ; p_z}(x)\\\\ -i \\sqrt{2\\nu qb } i_{\\nu -1;p_z}(x ) \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] for spin up , and @xmath25}{\\sqrt{2e(e+m)l_y l_z}}\\left ( \\begin{array}{ccc } 0\\\\ ( e+m)i_{\\nu -1;p_z}(x)\\\\    i \\sqrt{2\\nu qb } i_{\\nu ; p_z}(x)\\\\ - p_z i_{\\nu -1;p_z}(x)\\\\ \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] for spin down cases . where the energy @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the landau level .",
    "it is degenerate and can be expressed as other quantum numbers such as , @xmath28 is the orbital quantum number and @xmath29 is the spin quantum number .",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31 is the charge of u - quark . in @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is hermite polynomial",
    "if the matrix element for the reaction(1 ) is determined , we can express the rate per volume of reaction(1 ) as@xcite : @xmath36|m_{s}|^{2}s(2\\pi)^{4}\\delta^{4}(p_{1}+p_{d}-p_{2}-p_{s})\\ ] ] where the phase space integrals are to be calculated over all particle states , the statistical distribution function @xmath37 , the quark in equation(1 ) are described by fermi - dirac distributions in the form @xmath38^{-1 } , i=1,2,d , s\\ ] ] where @xmath39 are the chemical potential .",
    "we consider the reaction @xmath40 when the magnetic field is not strong enough to force the quark into the lowest landau level .",
    "previous study @xcite shows that the matrix element for the weak process remains unaffected and only the phase factor is modified .",
    "the matrix element summed over final spins and averaged over initial spins is given by @xcite : @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the four - momentum of the quark @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the fermi constant , @xmath45 is the cabibbo angle(@xmath46).we neglect the masses of up and down quarks , then @xmath47 .",
    "so the four - momentum products can be written as@xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the angle between quarks @xmath43 and @xmath50 .",
    "now we can calculate the rate of weak process in the weak magnetic field by replacing the u - quark phase space factor@xcite @xmath51 so the reaction rate can be write as : @xmath52 where @xmath53    as we known , the angle between two vector is a function of the respective inclinations and azimuth angle in spherical coordinates , ie .",
    "@xmath54 in magnetic field , the angles of the polarized quarks,@xmath55 vary with landau level ( @xmath56 ) and z - component momentum ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "therefore the integrals and summations in @xmath58 become very difficult due to the coupling of variables @xmath27 and @xmath59 into the integrated function .",
    "we need to make a improvement on chakrabaty s approach .",
    "fortunately , we can approximately regard the angles as independent variables for the weak field situation and then the integrals and summations decouples each other , because the kinetic quark direction should have only a small deviation from the field - free case , although the modification of the absolute value of the momentum considered under the situations.it completely coincides with free - particle s matrix approximation described by @xmath60 .",
    "we immediately have : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the summation and integral independent of the direction angles . in this approximation , which may be called free - particle direction average(fda ) .",
    "eqn(13 ) and eqn(14 ) read : @xmath64 where @xmath65    since @xmath66 , only those fermions whose momenta lie close to their respect fermi surface can take part in the reaction .",
    "we use the method in @xciteto complete partially the integral of @xmath67 through @xmath68 can be written as : @xmath69\\ \\\\&\\equiv&\\frac{2^{7}\\pi^{2}}{p_{f_{1}}p_{f_{2}}p_{f_{s}}}j\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 and the integral @xmath71 is defined through @xmath72 and @xmath73,can be calculated numerically .",
    "the net rate of transforming d - quark into s - quark is @xcite @xmath74\\gamma(u_{1}d\\rightarrow su_{2})\\ ] ] using the method in @xcite and substitute @xmath75 and ( 21 ) into ( 22 ) we can get @xmath76 where @xmath77 when the @xmath78 the sum can be replaced by integral of @xmath27 and then the result goes over to the expression : @xmath79 it is just the field - free case .",
    "now we consider strong magnetic field effect on the non - leptonic weak interaction in this section.in the case of strong magnetic field that @xmath80 , all u - quarks occupy the lowest landau ground state with the u - quark spins pointing in the direction of the magnetic field.we treat other flavors in this process as free particle which do not affected by the magnetic field . the matrix element for",
    "the reaction reads : @xmath81 d , s quark treat as free particle , then we get @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes four - dimensional momentum,@xmath85",

    "we now calculate the matrix elements squared and summed over the initial state and average over the final state.we use the @xmath92 and @xmath93 to express corresponding matrix element :    @xmath94[\\bar{u_{2}}\\gamma_{\\mu}(1-\\gamma_{5})u_{d}\\bar{u_{s } } \\gamma^{\\mu}(1-\\gamma_{5})u_{1}]^{\\dag}\\ ] ]    and then imediately get : @xmath95 , and then @xmath96,@xmath97,otherwise @xmath98 . carrying out the integral , we obtain    @xmath99    the rate per volume of the reaction",
    "is given by :    @xmath100 comes from 2 spins and 3 colors.since only left - hand helicity states of @xmath101 couples to the @xmath102 ( @xmath102 is the mediate of the reaction ) , a factor of @xmath103 is shown in the @xmath104 .",
    "the integrals over @xmath105 and @xmath106 can be carried out using the y - component momentum delta function .",
    "the integrals over @xmath107 and @xmath108 are converted into @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively@xcite .",
    "since @xmath111,only those momenta lie close to their respective fermi surfaces can take part in the reaction . as the z - component momentum conservation",
    ", we can get @xmath112 we approximately set @xmath113 near the equilibrium.then we can get @xmath114,so we can take out the integral over d - quark and s - quark s momentum space .    substituting eqn(35 ) into eqn(22 ) , we obtain    @xmath115\\nonumber \\\\(3\\mu_{s}+6\\mu_{u}-\\mu_{d } ) \\mu_{d}^{2}\\delta\\mu ( \\delta\\mu^{2}+4\\pi^{2}t^{2})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath116,@xmath117 .",
    "we have done calculations of the rate of non - leptonic quark weak process in magnetic field and give the analytic solutions under weak - field and strong - field approximation . based on these results ,",
    "we express the net rate of the transforming d - quark to s - quark in a unified form : @xmath118 where @xmath15 takes @xmath119 denotes zero - field , weak - field and strong - field cases respectively.in according with the formula(25 ) , the result go over to the field - free case when the magnetic field strength vanishes .",
    "we thus have : @xmath120 meanwhile for @xmath121,the @xmath122 reads simply from eqn(23 ) @xmath123 where @xmath71 as a function of @xmath124 define in figure(1).we find @xmath122 has a small deviation from field - free case.the comparison is made in figure(2 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-equilibrium @xmath130 the charge neutrality @xmath131 the baryon number density conservation @xmath132 should be satisfied .",
    "then we solve these equation numerically to obtain the chemical potential of the quarks with respective magnetic field .",
    "figure(3 ) shows that the chemical potentials of quarks are nearly equal under this situation.combines @xmath133 and @xmath134 in the approximation of @xmath135 , @xmath124 can be solved analytically through the algebraic equation              under the consideration that u - quark is polarized but effect of other flavors are negligible , we investigate the influence of magnetic field on the non - leptonic rate although the result for the weak field case has a small deviation from the field - free case , we give an analytical treatment of the weak reaction which can be extended to the calculations of other reaction process .",
    "however , the strong magnetic field can extremely suppress the rate.it is possible to lead the decrease of bulk viscosity in magnetized sqm.this may have serious implications for compact star and pulsar dynamics.in fact , we should also distinguish d - quark and s - quark in calculations to obtain refining result for applications .",
