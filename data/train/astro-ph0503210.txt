    "there is evidence for the existence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) over a range of epochs ; smbhs with masses @xmath3  m@xmath1 are ubiquitous in local galactic bulges ( e.g. magorrian et al .",
    "1998 : ferrarese  2002 ) , while the smbhs powering quasars [ which have been detected at redshifts as high as @xmath4 ( fan et al .  2001 ; fan et al .  2003 ) ] are estimated to range between @xmath5 m@xmath1 ( see e.g. shields et al .",
    "evidence for the early assembly of smbhs , when interpreted within a hierarchical cosmology , suggests that smbh coalescence may be a frequent event . if this is the case , the gravitational waves ( gws ) generated during smbh coalescence are a prime candidate for detection by the _ laser interferometer space antennae _",

    "estimates of the smbh coalescence rate depend crucially on the occupation fraction of smbhs in halos , and therefore on the adopted model for the formation and growth of smbhs . within a hierarchical cdm cosmology , both seeded smbh formation models [ in which a primordial population of smbhs grow via accretion and/or merging ( eg . volonteri et al . 2003 ) ] and ongoing formation models [ where smbhs form jointly with bulges in halos ( eg .",
    "kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) ] are consistent with the present - day ubiquity of smbhs in galactic bulges ( menou et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the formation of a smbh may be limited to potential wells above a minimum depth .",
    "if so , then there exists a critical halo virial temperature ( @xmath6 ) below which a halo can not host smbh formation .",
    "if @xmath6 is low ( eg . @xmath7  k ) , then smbhs are abundant in small halos , and predicted event rates are in the order of 100 s per year ( wyithe & loeb 2003 ; haehnelt 2004 ) .",
    "this event rate may be significantly lower , less than one per year , if @xmath8  k and smbhs form only at the centres of massive galaxies ( haehnelt 2004 ) .",
    "hence the detection rate has the potential to constrain the global smbh population [ with the important caveat of the unknown efficiency of binary black hole ( bbh ) coalescence , see [ snr ] ] .",
    "the rate of coalescence detectable by lisa depends on the form of the gw signal and the instrument s sensitivity curve .",
    "previous estimates of the event rate have used characteristic ( rather than time - dependent ) gw signals to determine approximate detection limits ( wyithe & loeb  2003 ) or have estimated the number of detectable events by comparing the sensitivity curve with the total gravitational wave background due to coalescing bbhs ( sesana et al .",

    "we perform the first empirically motivated calculations for the lisa detection rate of smbh mergers in a hierarchical cosmology that use accurate signal to noise ratios ( snrs ) to determine detection criteria . in [ snr ]",
    "we describe the calculation of snrs for the lisa detection of bbh coalescence . in [ merger ] we discuss our calculation of the smbh merger rate , including our halo merger rate predictions , estimate for the occupation fraction of smbhs in halos and the @xmath9@xmath10 relationship . finally , we present our event rate predictions as a function of @xmath6 ( [ merger ] ) before concluding in [ concl ] . throughout this work",

    "the efficiency with which bbhs coalesce is highly uncertain .",
    "initially , the smbhs sink independently toward the centre of a merged system due to dynamical friction from the dark matter background until they form a bound binary ( begelman , blandford & rees 1980 ) .",
    "the efficiency of this process depends on the orbital parameters of the merging dark matter halos ( van den bosch et al .",
    "1999 ; colpi , mayer & governato 1999 ) .",
    "as the orbital separation ( @xmath19 ) decreases , 3-body interactions with stars that pass within @xmath20 of the bbh centre of mass ( the `` loss cone '' ) increasingly dominate the energy loss .",
    "depending on the orbital parameters of the binary and the background distribution of stars , this process may result in a hardened [ orbital velocity ( @xmath21 ) @xmath22 stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath23 ) ] binary system . if hardening continues until a binary separation where energy losses are dominated by gws , the binary will coalesce .",
    "yu ( 2002 ) argues that the efficiency of bbh coalescence hinges on the time - scale for bbh hardening during the hard binary phase . during this stage ,",
    "three - body interactions between the bbh and individual stars eject stars into highly elliptical orbits , lowering the inner stellar density and slowing further hardening ( eg .",
    "volonteri et al .",
    "the deceleration of the hardening rate is compounded by the preferential depletion of stars within the loss cone ( region of parameter space where angular momentum is low enough that stars pass near the bbh ) , resulting in a deficiency of stars that can extract energy from the binary system ( see yu  2002 ) .",
    "uncertainties in the efficiency of processes which may replenish loss cone stars make this effect difficult to analyse .",
    "two - body stellar relaxation is expected to result in some diffusion of stars back into the loss cone ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) but it is unclear that this process alone can support sufficient hardening .",
    "numerical n - body simulations have been used to include the effect of the bbh wander within the star field ( due to 3-body interactions with stars ) , which increases the effective size of the loss cone and may prevent the coalescence from stalling ( quinlan & hernquist 1997 ; milosavljevi ' c & merritt 2001 ; chatterjee , hernquist & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "other scenarios which may aid evolution of the bbh into the gw dominated regime have been proposed , including the effects of gaseous disks ( gould & rix 2000 ) , flattened or triaxial stellar distributions ( yu 2002 ) and disruption by a third smbh ( hut & rees  1992 ) .",
    "the efficiency of bbh coalescence is of prime concern for lisa detection rates . whilst undoubtably still an open question , we note that there are plausible mechanisms to extract the required energy from the binary system . for the purposes of our calculation ( [ merger ] )",
    "we therefore assume that hardening of the binary to the gw dominated regime occurs with an efficiency ( @xmath24 ) of unity .",
    "all event rates quoted in this paper are proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "the gravitational wave dominated portion of bbh coalescence may be divided into three main phases ( hughes  2002 ) .",
    "the binary begins in the _ inspiral phase _ , with the smbhs slowly spiralling into tighter orbits due to the adiabatic loss of gw energy .",
    "eventually the dynamics become relativistically unstable and the smbhs violently plunge to form a single object ( _ merger phase _ ) .",
    "the final gw signal can be described by modelling the merged system as a perturbed kerr smbh ( _ ringdown phase _ ) .",
    "the dynamics of the inspiral and ringdown phases are well understood and theoretical waveforms for the gws have been derived . however , certain parameters of the ringdown solution depend on unknown details of the merger phase and must be guided by the results of numerical simulation ( see [ ringdown ] ) .",
    "detection of gws from a single binary source will be complicated by the presence of galactic and extra - galactic gw foregrounds , and by lisa s sensitivity to gws from all sky directions .",
    "matched filter template searches will therefore be necessary to detect the gw signal from an individual event ( hughes et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the snr for a matched filter detection ( @xmath25 ) is defined by the ratio of the coherently folded signal and noise powers :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the fourier transform of the dimensionless strain and @xmath28 is the spectral power of the noise .",
    "we calculate snrs for the final year ( before the merger phase ) of the inspiral signal .",
    "the effective duration of the ringdown phase is much shorter than one year and we therefore calculate ringdown snrs over the entire phase .",
    "estimates of lisa s noise spectrum are evolving with plans for the instrument design . a recently suggested sensitivity goal ( bender  2003 )",
    "has a ( dimensionless ) threshold sensitivity [ defined as @xmath29 , for @xmath30 and 1 yr of observation ] with a low frequency power - law slope of @xmath31 for frequencies ranging between @xmath32 and @xmath33  hz , and a power - law slope of @xmath34 for frequencies of @xmath35 to @xmath32  hz .",
    "bender  ( 2003 ) suggests a hard low frequency cut off at @xmath36  hz , roughly corresponding to the lowest resolvable frequency for a year long mission .",
    "lisa will be sensitive to frequencies up to @xmath37  hz . as a general rule @xmath38",
    "is required for the confident detection of a signal ( hughes et al .",
    "2001 ) .      as the orbital separation of the binary shrinks , both the amplitude and frequency of the inspiralling strain increase . to calculate accurate inspiral phase snrs ,",
    "it is important to include the frequency dependence of the strain in the integration of signal to noise .",
    "we achieve this using the technique outlined by flanagan & hughes ( 1998 , henceforth fh98 ) .",
    "fh98 show that sky averaged squared snr ( @xmath39 can be re - expressed in terms of the emitted gw energy spectrum @xmath40    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the frequency of the gw .",
    "this is related to the observed gw frequency ( @xmath43 ) via the cosmological redshift of the source [ @xmath44 .",
    "the inspiral energy spectrum may be easily calculated to first order from the quadrupole approximation for the gravitational wave luminosity ( fh98 )    @xmath45    where @xmath9 and @xmath46 are the individual bbh masses corresponding to a reduced mass @xmath47 and total mass @xmath48 .",
    "numerical simulations of bbh coalescence indicate that this approximation is reasonable until @xmath43 reaches @xmath49  hz ( fh98 ) which roughly corresponds to the observed frequency when equal mass bbhs have an orbital separation of 3 schwarzchild radii ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this frequency forms the upper limit of integration in equation ( [ en_spec_snr ] ) .",
    "since the gw frequency of bbh coalescence typically increases with time , this frequency may be used to delineate the inspiral and merger phases .",

    "we therefore use the greater of @xmath54 and @xmath55 as the lower limit of integration in equation  ( [ en_spec_snr ] ) .",
    "we use the technique described by hughes ( 2002 ) to calculate snrs for the ringdown phase .",
    "bbh coalescence is expected to result in a rotating smbh with a bar - like excitation of the event horizon ( hughes  2002 ) .",
    "this distortion of the kerr solution may be modelled by the bar - like [ @xmath56 quasi - normal mode ( kokkotas & schmidt 1999 ) . the corresponding time dependent strain is described by an exponentially damped sinusoid with total ( observed ) amplitude ( @xmath57 ) whose value depends on the fraction of the bbh mass - energy ( @xmath58 ) radiated during the ringdown phase ( @xmath59 ) , the binary mass , and the spin parameter of the merger product ( @xmath60 ) .",

    "more massive bbh systems radiate gws at lower frequencies and for a given binary system the ringdown signal is at a higher frequency [ see equations ( [ f_oneyr ] ) & ( [ rd_fits1 ] ) ]",
    ". therefore if the sensitivity curve has a low frequency cut off and/or degrades rapidly with frequency , searches for the ringdown signal will probe more massive bbhs .",
    "we find that ringdown searches can detect coalescence between bhs with masses up to @xmath93  m@xmath1 ( @xmath94  m@xmath1 ) at @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) . in the left hand panel of figure  [ snr_results ]",
    "we plot the snr for the inspiral ( _ dot - dashed line _ ) and ringdown ( _ solid line _ ) phases of equal mass , @xmath95 bbh coalescence as a function of single bh mass .",
    "the right hand panel shows the ratio of ringdown to inspiral snrs , with the hatched region denoting the mass range over which the ringdown signal is detectable .",
    "the snr is greater in the ringdown signal for @xmath97  m@xmath1 .",
    "we note that there exists a range of smbh masses ( @xmath98  m@xmath1 at @xmath99 ) for which bbh coalescence is detectable only in the ringdown phase .",
    "since characteristic frequencies decay with @xmath100 , this mass range decreases with redshift .",
    "by @xmath101 , the mass range is comparable to the typical smbh mass observed in the local universe ( @xmath102  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the calculations of fh98 and reinforce the point that searches for gravitational radiation from the ringdown phase may generate constraints on the high mass smbh population .",
    "the higher frequency of the ringdown signal from smbh binaries offers limited advantage for their detection if the low frequency sensitivity has a power - law slope of @xmath103 and no lower cut - off ( corresponding to the optimal scenario of constant accelerometer dominated noise , see white  2002 ) .",
    "however , it is expected that frequency dependent sources of spurious acceleration will result in a steeper low - frequency sensitivity curve ( bender  2003 ) .",
    "in addition to the instrumental noise , unresolved gws from various classes of binary systems are expected to limit lisa s sensitivity ( see sesana et al .",
    "however , sesana et al .",
    "( 2004b ) calculate that bbh coalescence only dominates the sky noise below a frequency of @xmath104  hz , and this noise is still an order of magnitude lower than the suggested lisa sensitivity .",
    "therefore the unresolved bbh background should not significantly affect lisa s sensitivity to supermassive bbh coalescence .",

    "our smbh occupation fraction and accurate detection criteria result in predictions that decay more rapidly with increasing @xmath6 than previous calculations suggested .",

    "however , there is evidence for smbhs as small as @xmath0  m@xmath1 in local galactic bulges ( ferrarese  2002 ) and low - luminosity , low - redshift agn ( greene & ho  2004 ) .",

    "our calculation differs by employing empirically motivated estimates for the population of smbhs in halos .",

    "( 2004a ) specify a detailed model for binary evolution that results in some binaries being ejected from the galaxy core ( where they do not coalesce ) .",
