    "in recent years , progress has been made in the study of gauge theory with matter in the fundamental representation in the context of gauge / string dualities generalizing the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "one way to achieve this is by introducing d7-branes in the probe limit@xcite that amounts to the condition @xmath7 .",
    "the fundamental strings stretched between the stack of @xmath8 d3-branes and the @xmath9 flavor d7-branes give rise to @xmath10=2 hypermultiplet .",
    "the separation of the d3- and d7-branes in the transverse directions corresponds to the mass of the hypermultiplet , the classical shape of the d7-brane encodes the value of the fermionic condensate , and its fluctuations describe the light meson spectrum of the theory@xcite .",
    "this technique for introducing fundamental matter has been widely employed in different backgrounds .",
    "of particular interest is the study of non supersymmetric backgrounds and phenomena such as spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "these phenomena were first studied in this context in ref .",
    "@xcite , using analytical and numerical techniques . in several works",
    "this approach was further developed , and has proven itself a powerful tool for the exploration of gauge theories , in particular , for the description of their thermodynamic properties or for the building of phenomenological models relevant to qcd @xcite@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will be interested in introducing fundamental matter into the gauge theory in the presence of an external electromagnetic field that couples to the fundamental fermions .",
    "the supersymmetry will be explicitly broken by the external field , and we will observe spontaneous symmetry breaking , and non  trivial mixing in the spectrum of mesons .",
    "let us consider the ads@xmath11 geometry describing the near - horizon physics of a collection of @xmath8 extremal d3-branes .",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the unit metric on a round @xmath14 . in order to introduce fundamental matter",
    "we first rewrite the metric in the following form , with @xmath15 the metric on a unit @xmath16 : @xmath17+\\frac{r^2}{\\rho^2+l^2}[d\\rho^2+\\rho^2d\\omega_{3}^2+dl^2+l^2d\\phi^2],\\nonumber\\\\ d\\omega_{3}^2&=&d\\psi^2+\\cos^2\\psi d\\beta^2+\\sin^2\\psi d\\gamma^2 , \\label{geometry1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are polar coordinates in the transverse @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "note that : @xmath22 .",
    "we use @xmath23 to parametrise the world volume of the d7-brane and consider the following ansatz @xcite for its embedding : @xmath24 leading to the following form of the induced metric on its worldvolume : @xmath25+\\frac{r^2}{\\rho^2+l(\\rho)^2}[(1+l'(\\rho)^2)d\\rho^2+\\rho^2d\\omega_{3}^2 ] \\   .",

    "a simple way to introduce magnetic field would be to consider a pure gauge @xmath1-field along parts of the d3-branes world volume , _",
    "e.g. _ : @xmath31 since @xmath29 can be mixed with the gauge field strength @xmath30 , this is equivalent to a magnetic field on the world  volume . recently",
    "a similar approach was used to study drag force in sym plasma @xcite . note that since the @xmath1-field is pure gauge , @xmath32 , the corresponding background is still a solution to the supergravity equations of motion . on the other hand ,",
    "the gauge field @xmath30 comes at next order in the @xmath33 expansion compared to the metric and the @xmath1-field components . therefore to study the classical embedding of the d - brane one can study only the @xmath34 part of the dbi - action .",
    "however , because of the presence of the @xmath1-field , there will be terms ot first order in @xmath33 in the full action linear in the gauge field @xmath30 . hence integrating out @xmath30 will result in a constraint for the classical embedding of the d7-brane .",
    "since for our configuration , we have that : @xmath35 and at first order in @xmath33 the only contribution to the wess - zummino is @xmath36      it is this potential which breaks the supersymmety .",
    "it is important to note that there is no contradiction between the fact that the @xmath1field that we have chosen does not break the supersymmetry of the ads@xmath52 supergravity background , on the one hand , and the fact that the physics of the d7brane probing that background does have supersymmetry broken by the @xmath1field , on the other .",
    "this is because the physics of the probe does not back ",
    "react on the geometry .    in what follows",
    ", we will study the physics of the d7-branes and the resulting dual gauge theory physics . among the solutions for the d7-brane embedding",
    ", there will be a class with non - trivial profile having zero asymptotic separation between the d3- and d7-branes .",
    "this corresponds to a non - zero fermionic condensate at zero bare quark mass .",
    "therefore the non - zero background magnetic field will spontaneously break the chiral symmetry .",
    "geometrically this corresponds to breaking of the @xmath53 rotational symmetry in the @xmath54-plane @xcite .",
    "we now proceed with the exploration of the properties of the classical d7-brane embedding .",
    "if we consider the action ( [ decopl ] ) at leading order in @xmath33 , we get the following effective lagrangian : @xmath55 the equation of motion for the profile @xmath48 of the d7-brane is given by : @xmath56 as expected for large @xmath57 or @xmath58 , we get the equation for the pure ads@xmath0 background @xcite : @xmath59 therefore the solutions to equation ( [ eqnmnl ] ) have the following behavior at infinity : @xmath60 where the parameters @xmath61 ( the asymptotic separation of the d7- and d3- branes ) and @xmath62 ( the degree of bending of the d7-brane ) are related to the bare quark mass @xmath63 and the fermionic condensate @xmath64 respectively @xcite .",
    "as we shall see below , the presence of the external magnetic field and its effect on the dual sym provide a non vanishing value for the fermionic condensate , furthermore the theory exhibits chiral symmetry breaking .    now notice that @xmath65 enters in ( [ lagrangian ] ) only through the combination @xmath66 .",
    "the other natural scale is the asymptotic separation @xmath61 .",
    "it turns out that different physical configurations can be studied in terms of the ratio @xmath67 : once the @xmath68 dependence of our solutions are known , the @xmath61 and @xmath65 dependence follows .",
    "indeed let us introduce dimensionless variables _ via _ : @xmath69 the equation of motion ( [ eqnmnl ] ) then takes the form : @xmath70 the solutions for @xmath71 can be expanded again to : @xmath72 and using the transformation ( [ cordchange ] ) we can get : @xmath73    it is instructive to study first the properties of ( [ eqnmnld ] ) for @xmath74 , which corresponds to weak magnetic field @xmath75 , or equivalently large quark mass @xmath76 .      in order to analyze the case of weak magnetic field",
    "let us expand @xmath77 and linearize equation ( [ eqnmnld ] ) while leaving only the leading terms in @xmath78 .",
    "the result is : @xmath79 which has the general solution : @xmath80 from the definition of @xmath81 and equation  ( [ expansiond ] ) we can see that @xmath82 and since @xmath83 we have @xmath84 .",
    "now if we consider @xmath68 large enough , equation ( [ solutionsma ] ) should be valid for all @xmath85 .",
    "it turns out that if we require that our solution be finite as @xmath86 we can determine the large  @xmath68 behavior of @xmath87 .",
    "indeed the second term in ( [ solutionsma ] ) has the expansion : @xmath88 therefore we deduce that : @xmath89 and finally , we get for the profile of the d7-brane for @xmath90 : @xmath91 if we go back to dimensionful parameters we can see , using equations ( [ hdepend ] ) and ( [ 1/m ] ) that for weak magnetic field @xmath65 the theory has developed a fermionic condensate : @xmath92    however this formula is valid only for sufficiently large @xmath61 and we can not make any prediction for the value of the fermionic condensate at zero quark mass . to go further , the involved form of equation ( [ eqnmnld ] ) suggests the use of numerical techniques .",
    "in this subsection we solve numerically equation ( [ eqnmnld ] ) for the embedding of the d7-brane , using mathematica .",
    "it is convenient to use initial conditions in the ir as has been recently discussed in the literature @xcite , @xcite.we use the boundary condition @xmath93 .",
    "we used shooting techniques to generate the embedding of the d7 for a wide range of @xmath68 .",
    "having done so we expanded numerically the solutions for @xmath71 as in equation ( [ expansiond ] ) and generated the points in the @xmath94 plane corresponding to the solutions .",
    "the resulting plot is presented in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .    )",
    ", one can observe that the analytic result is valid for large @xmath68 .",
    "it is also evident that for @xmath95 @xmath96 .",
    "the corresponding value of the condensate is @xmath97,width=377 ]    .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]    as one can see there is a non zero fermionic condensate for zero bare quark mass , the corresponding value of the condensate is @xmath97 .",
    "it is also evident that the analytical expression for the condensate ( [ 1/m ] ) that we got in the previous section is valid for large @xmath68 , as expected . now using equation ( [ hdepend ] ) we can deduce the dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath65 : @xmath99    it is interesting to check the consistency of our numerical analysis by solving equation  ( [ eqnmnl ] ) numerically and extracting the value of @xmath98 for wide range of @xmath100 , the resulting plot fitted with equation ( [ ccr ] ) is presented in figure [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "as function of @xmath100 , the black curve represents equation ( [ ccr]).,width=340 ]    another interesting feature of our phase diagram is the spiral behavior near the origin of the @xmath94-plane which can be seen in figure [ fig : spiral ] .",
    "a similar feature has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors have argued that only the lowest branch of the spiral corresponding to positive values of @xmath61 is the stable one ( corresponding to the lowest energy state ) .",
    "the spiral behavior near the origin signals instability of the embedding corresponding to @xmath101 .",
    "if we trace the curve of the diagram in figure [ fig : spiral ] starting from large @xmath61 , as we go to smaller values of @xmath61 we will reach zero bare quark mass for some large negative value of the fermionic condensate @xmath102 .",
    "now if we continue tracing along the diagram one can verify numerically that all other points correspond to embeddings of the d7-brane which intersect the d3-brane at least once .",
    "( note also that in ref .",
    "@xcite , such behavior was considered inconsistent with the interpretation of the embedding as a re - normalization group flow . ) after further study one finds that the part of the diagram corresponding to negative values of @xmath68 represents solutions for the d7-brane embedding which intersect the d3-branes odd number of times , while the positive part of the spiral represents solutions which intersect the d3-branes even number of times .",
    "the lowest positive branch corresponds to solutions which do nt intersect the d3-branes and is the stable one , while the upper branches have correspondingly @xmath103 intersection points and are ruled out .     to show the spiral behavior near the origin of the @xmath104-plane.,width=340 ]",
    "we study the scalar meson spectrum .",
    "to do so we will consider quadratic fluctuations @xcite of the embedding of the d7-brane in the transverse @xmath105-plane . it can be shown that because of the diagonal form of the metric the fluctuation modes along the @xmath106 coordinate decouple from the one along @xmath107 . however , because of the non - commutativity introduced by the @xmath1-field we may expect the scalar fluctuations to couple to the vector fluctuations .",
    "this has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors considered the geometric dual to non - commutative super yang mills . in our case",
    "the mixing will be even stronger , because of the non - trivial profile for the d7-brane embedding , resulting from the broken supersymmetry .",
    "let s proceed with obtaining the action for the fluctuations . to obtain the contribution from the dbi part of the action we consider the expansion : @xmath108 where @xmath48 is the classical embedding of the d7-brane solution to equation ( [ eqnmnl ] ) . to second order in @xmath33",
    "we have the following expression : @xmath109 where @xmath110 are given by : @xmath111 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the induced metric and b field on the d7-brane s world volume .",
    "now we can substitute equation ( [ expnmetrc ] ) into equation ( [ decopl ] ) and expand to second order in @xmath33 .",
    "it is convenient @xcite to introduce the following matrices :    @xmath112    where @xmath113 is diagonal and @xmath114 is antisymmetric : @xmath115    now it is straightforward to get the effective action . at first order in @xmath33",
    "the action for the scalar fluctuations is the first variation of the classical action ( [ decopl ] ) and is satisfied by the classical equations of motion .",
    "the equation of motion for the gauge field at first order was considered in section 2 for the computation of the @xmath41 potential induced by the @xmath1- field .",
    "therefore we focus on the second order contribution from the dbi action .    after integrating by parts and taking advantage of the bianchi identities for the gauge field , we end up with the following terms . for @xmath116 : @xmath117\\frac{1}{2}\\chi^2\\ , \\label{schi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for @xmath118 : @xmath119 and the mixed @xmath116@xmath118 terms : @xmath120 and for @xmath121 : @xmath122 where the function @xmath123 in ( [ sfchi ] ) is given by : @xmath124    as can be seen from equation ( [ sfchi ] ) the @xmath125 components of the gauge field couple to the scalar field @xmath116 via the function @xmath123 .",
    "note that since for @xmath126 and @xmath127 , we see that @xmath128 , the mixing of the scalar and vector field decouples asymptoticly . in order to proceed with the analysis we need to take into account the contribution from the wess - zumino part of the action .",
    "the relevant terms to second order in @xmath33 are @xcite : @xmath129\\ , \\label{wz}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is the background r - r potential given in equation  ( [ ads ] ) and @xmath131 is the pull back of its magnetic dual .",
    "one can show that : @xmath132 writing @xmath133 we write for the pull back @xmath134 $ ] : @xmath135=-\\frac{2\\pi\\alpha'}{g_s}\\frac{\\sin2\\psi}{2}k(\\rho)\\partial_{a}\\phi d\\psi\\wedge d\\alpha\\wedge d\\beta\\wedge dx^a , \\label{pulc}\\ ] ] where we have defined : @xmath136 now note that the @xmath1-field has components only along @xmath137 and @xmath138 , therefore @xmath139 in equation ( [ pulc ] ) can be only @xmath140 or @xmath141 .",
    "this will determine the components of the gauge field which can mix with @xmath121 , however after integrating by parts and using the bianchi identities one can get the following simple expression for the mixing term : @xmath142 resulting in the following contribution to the complete lagrangian : + @xmath143 note that this means that only the @xmath144 and @xmath145 components of the gauge field couple to the scalar field @xmath121 . next the contribution from the first term in ( [ wz ] ) is given by : @xmath146 where the indices take values along the @xmath147 directions of the world volume .",
    "this will contribute to the equation of motion for @xmath148 and @xmath149 , which do not couple to the scalar fluctuations . in this paper",
    "we will be interested in analyzing the spectrum of the scalar modes , therefore we will not be interested in the components of the gauge field transverse to the d3-branes world volume .",
    "however although there are no sources for these components from the scalar fluctuations , they still couple to the components along the d3-branes as a result setting them to zero will impose constraints on the @xmath150 . indeed from the equation of motion for the gauge field along the transverse direction one gets : @xmath151 ( here , no summation on repeated indices is intended .",
    ") however the non - zero @xmath1-field explicitly breaks the lorentz symmetry along the d3-branes world volume .",
    "in particular we have : @xmath152 which suggests that we should impose : @xmath153 we will see that these constraints are consistent with the equations of motion for @xmath150 .",
    "indeed with this constraint the equations of motion for @xmath116 , @xmath121 and @xmath154 are , for @xmath116 : @xmath155 and for @xmath121 : @xmath156 and finally for @xmath40 : @xmath157 we have defined : @xmath158 as one can see the spectrum splits into two independent components , namely the vector modes @xmath159 couple to the scalar fluctuations along @xmath121 , while the vector modes @xmath125 couple to the scalar modes along @xmath116 .",
    "however it is possible to further simplify the equations of motion for the gauge field .",
    "focusing on the equations of motion for @xmath144 and @xmath145 in equnation  ( [ eqgauge ] ) , it is possible to rewrite them as : @xmath160 note that the first constraint in ( [ constra ] ) trivially satisfies the second equation in ( [ elec ] ) . in this way we are left with the first equation in ( [ elec ] ) .",
    "similarly one can show that using the second constraint in ( [ constra ] ) the equations of motion in ( [ eqgauge ] ) for @xmath161 and @xmath162 boil down to a single equation for @xmath163 : @xmath164 now let us proceed with a study of the fluctuations along @xmath121 .      to proceed , we have to take into account the @xmath165 component of the gauge field strength and solve the coupled equations of motion . since the classical solution for the embedding of the @xmath166-brane is known only numerically we have to rely again on numerics to study the meson spectrum .",
    "however if we look at equation ( [ eqnmnl ] ) we can see that the terms responsible for the non  trivial parts of the equation of motion are of order @xmath167 . on the other hand , the mixing of the scalar and vector modes due to the term ( [ mixing ] ) appear at first order in @xmath65 .",
    "therefore it is possible to extract some non - trivial properties of the meson spectrum even at linear order in @xmath65 and as it turns out , we can observe a zeeman  like effect : a splitting of states that is proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field . to describe this ,",
    "let us study the approximation of weak magnetic field .",
    "to first order in @xmath65 the classical solution for the d7-brane profile is given by : @xmath168 where @xmath61 is the asymptotic separation of the d3 and d7-branes and corresponds to the bare quark mass . in this approximation",
    "the expressions for @xmath169 and @xmath170 , become : @xmath171 and the equations of motion for @xmath121 and @xmath165 , equations ( [ eqnphi ] ) and ( [ elec ] ) , simplify to : @xmath172 this system has become similar to the system studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and in order to decouple it we can define the fields : @xmath173 where @xmath174 .",
    "the resulting equations of motion are : @xmath175 note that @xmath176 is the casimir operator in the @xmath177 plane only , while @xmath178 is the casimir operator along the d3-branes world volume .",
    "if we consider a plane wave @xmath179 then we can define : @xmath180 and we have the relation : @xmath181 the corresponding spectrum of @xmath182 is continuous in @xmath183 .",
    "however , if we restrict ourselves to motion in the @xmath184-plane the spectrum is discrete .",
    "indeed let us consider the ansatz : @xmath185 then we can write : @xmath186 let us analyze equation ( [ eqn01sm ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce : @xmath187 with this change of variables equation ( [ eqn01sm ] ) is equivalent to : @xmath188 next we can expand : @xmath189 leading to the following equations for @xmath190 and @xmath191 : @xmath192 the first equation in ( [ eqpert ] ) is the hypergeometric equation and corresponds to the fluctuations in pure @xmath193 .",
    "it has the regular solution @xcite : @xmath194 furthermore regularity of the solution for @xmath195 at infinity requires @xcite that @xmath196 be discrete , and hence the spectrum of @xmath197 : @xmath198 the second equation in ( [ eqpert ] ) is an inhomogeneous hypergeometric equation .",
    "however for the ground state , namely @xmath199 , @xmath200 and one can easily get the solution : @xmath201 on the other hand , using the definition of @xmath202 in ( [ varchan ] ) to first order in @xmath203 we can write : @xmath204 for the ground state @xmath205 and we end up with the following expression for @xmath206 : @xmath207 now if we require that our solution is regular at @xmath208 and goes as @xmath209 at infinity , the last term in ( [ groundstate ] ) must vanish .",
    "therefore we have : @xmath210     vs. @xmath211 for the first three states .",
    "the dashed black lines correspond to the spectrum given by equation  ( [ degen]),width=415 ]    after substituting in ( [ expansions ] ) and ( [ varchan ] ) we end up with the following correction to the ground sate : @xmath212 we observe how the introduction of an external magnetic field breaks the degeneracy of the spectrum given by equation ( [ degen ] ) and results in zeeman splitting of the energy states , proportional to the magnitude of @xmath65 . although equation ( [ zeeman ] ) was derived using the ground state it is natural to expect that the same effect takes place for higher excited states . to demonstrate this",
    "it is more convenient to employ numerical techniques for solving equation ( [ eqn01sm ] ) and use the methods described in ref .",
    "@xcite to extract the spectrum .",
    "the resulting plot is presented in figure [ fig : zeeman ] .",
    "as expected we observe zeeman splitting of the higher excited states .",
    "it is interesting that equation ( [ zeeman ] ) describes well not only the ground state , but also the first several excited states .",
    "it turns ou that one can easily generalize equation ( [ zeeman ] ) to the case of non - zero momentum in the @xmath213-plane .",
    "indeed if we start from equation ( [ eqnmotsimpl ] ) and proceed with the ansatz : @xmath214 we end up with : @xmath215 after going through the steps described in equations ( [ varchan])-([groundstate ] ) , equation ( [ correction ] ) gets modified to : @xmath216 note that validity of the perturbative analysis suggests that @xmath217 is of the order of @xmath218 and therefore we can trust the above expression as long as @xmath219 is of the order of @xmath220 .",
    "now it is straightforward to obtain the correction to the spectrum : @xmath221 we see that the addition of momentum along the @xmath222-plane enhances the splitting of the states .",
    "furthermore the spectrum depends continuously on @xmath219 .      for strong magnetic field",
    "we have to take into account terms of order @xmath167 , which means that we no longer have an expression for @xmath223 in a closed form and we have to rely on numerical calculations only .",
    "furthermore there is no obvious way to decouple equations ( [ eqnphi ] ) and  ( [ elec ] ) .",
    "however , it is still possible to extract information about the spectrum of the scalar modes if we restrict ourselves to fluctuations along the @xmath224 plane . in this way",
    "there is no source term in equation ( [ eqgauge ] ) , and we can consistently set @xmath165 equal to zero .",
    "we consider time independent fluctuations satisfying the ansatz @xmath225 , ( where @xmath226 is the radial coordinate in the @xmath227-plane ) .",
    "the damping factor in the exponent can be thought of as the mass of the scalar meson in 2 euclidean dimensions .",

    "set - up the equation of motion for @xmath121 , equation ( [ eqnphi ] ) , reduces to equation for @xmath231 : @xmath232 where we have defined : @xmath233 before we proceed with the numerical analysis of equation ( [ eqnphin ] ) let us introduce dimensionless variables by performing the transformation ( [ cordchange ] ) and defining : @xmath234 the resulting equation is : @xmath235 in order to study the spectrum we look for normalizable solutions which have asymptotic behavior @xmath236 for large @xmath85 and satisfy the following boundary conditions at @xmath237 : @xmath238 let us consider first the lowest level of the spectrum .",
