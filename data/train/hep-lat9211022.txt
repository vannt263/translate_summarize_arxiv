    "the doubling problem of lattice fermions is inevitable according to the nielsen ninomiya no - go theorem@xcite if the free - field action satisfies the conditions of reflection positivity , locality , global axial symmetry , and translational invariance at a fixed scale .",
    "an obvious resolution of the doubling problem is thus to relax one of those conditions to obtain , in the order listed above , non - hermitian@xcite , non - local@xcite , wilson@xcite , or random - lattice@xcite fermion formulations .",
    "these formulations are all free of doublers when there are no interactions or when the interactions are of a non - gauge nature@xcite : the extra poles in the propagators are removed as the lattice spacing @xmath0 decreases , leaving a single fermion mode in the continuum limit .",
    "gauge interactions behave very differently on account of a unique and special property .",
    "local gauge invariance imposes severe constraints on the theory , expressed mathematically in the ward - takahashi identities .",
    "in particular , the fermion - gauge vertex is related to the free inverse propagator , @xmath1 giving the interaction vertices mode dependency .",
    "this different coupling strength of doublers to gauge fields has been shown to revive these modes in loop diagrams , even though they are suppressed at the free - field level , in studies of some non - local @xcite and non - hermitian formulations@xcite .",
    "for this reason , we investigate the issue of fermion doubling on random lattices with gauge interactions@xcite .    in the random lattice approach ,",
    "suitable quantities are measured on a random lattice then averaged , either quenchedly or annealedly , over an ensemble of lattices . apart from the extra work involved in generating an ensemble of random lattices",
    ", this approach better approximates the scale - free rotational and translational symmetry of the continuum than that of regular lattices .",
    "thus , the scaling region near the continuum limit may be more easily reached on random lattices than on regular lattices of the same size .",
    "more relevant to this discussion , since there is no fixed brillouin zone , there need be no extra poles of the propagator .",
    "even if extra poles do exist , the one - to - one correspondence between propagator poles in momentum space and zero modes is not necessarily valid since plane waves are no longer eigenstates of the dirac operator@xcite .",
    "this expectation of no doubling on random lattices has been confirmed in various studies of free - field theory in both two and four dimensions@xcite .",
    "it has similarly been shown that random lattice theories with four - point interactions are also doubler free@xcite .",
    "we wish to compute the fermion determinant of abelian background gauge theory on a two dimensional euclidean random lattice which we approximate with @xmath2-\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-15mm}\\frac{1}{2}{\\rm tr}\\;\\left[(g_a^{-1}g_0 - 1)^2\\right]+o(g^4 ) , \\label{eqn.det}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the fermion propagator in the background gauge field @xmath4 .",
    "background fields are the most appropriate for our purposes , providing a clean signal which increases with the number of fermion flavours contributing to the internal lines .",
    "comparing with identical calculations for naive and wilson fermions on square lattices , which are known to be four - fold doubling and doubler - free respectively , clarifies the continuum limit behaviour of our random lattices .",
    "our lattice is constructed from a triangulated array of @xmath5 square lattice vertices by a random sequence of alexander `` flip '' moves , supplemented by further constraints which force the lattice to stay locally flat throughout the flipping procedure .",
    "we chose to randomise the lattice with @xmath6 successful flips .",
    "see figure [ fig.lat ] .",
    "+    this fixed vertex construction has several advantages over the lattices of @xcite : construction is @xmath7 , compared with @xmath8 , and the resulting lattice has a fixed vertex spacing ( a fixed size ) , so measured quantities do not need to be adjusted for different link - lengths .",
    "the trade off is that we have introduced a lattice dependent internal scale , @xmath9 , which will need to be dealt with .",
    "the fermion derivative is chosen such that it reduces to the naive result on lattices of regular arrangements of links .",
    "it is constructed by averaging the contributions of pairs of consecutive links @xmath10 around each vertex to the derivative in lattice framing co - ordinates , replacing the continuum @xmath11 with @xmath12\\ ] ] gauge interactions are introduced in the usual gauge - invariant manner using the link variables @xmath13 . an alternative definition @xmath14 which allows gauge invariance to be explicitly broken on the lattice ,",
    "is also considered .",
    "the resulting action is hermitian , local and axially - symmetric .",
    "measurements are made in a background gauge field @xmath15 with fixed physical quantities @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , for @xmath19",
    "we first compute a quantity derived from the free propagator @xmath20 evaluating the average zero momentum real particle propagator projected along the @xmath21 direction .",
    "figure [ fig.fpg ] summarises the calculation ,    clearly identifying the doubler suppression of free fermions on a random lattice in agreement with @xcite .",
    "indeed , apart from some minor small distance fluctuations of the order of the internal scale , the random lattice result matches the continuum completely ; the normalisation is reproduced exactly , and masses do not need to be tuned .",
    "the calculation of the approximation in equation [ eqn.det ] is complicated a little by its sensitivity to the internal scale of the lattice .",
    "ideally we would like to ignore this effect as a small correction , or have the internal scale match the lattice spacing @xmath22 . in practice , @xmath23 , the contribution is significant , and @xmath24 gets larger as the degree of randomisation is increased . using an ensemble of lattices ,",
    "it is possible to extrapolate to @xmath25 , leading to a mean value of this extrapolation , and uncertainties associated with the spread of geometrically different lattices that have the same @xmath24 .",
    "see figure [ fig.loop ] for the results .",
    "the naive case approaches the continuum limit quadratically with @xmath0 and the wilson approaches @xmath26 of the same result linearly , as expected .",
    "the same graph also indicates the random lattice results ; the number of lattice configurations used in the extrapolation is displayed next to each point .",
    "the lattice gauge invariant calculation is clearly more like the naive fermion than the wilson .",
    "moreover , had extrapolation in @xmath24 not been performed , the result would have been even larger . with",
    "gauge invariance broken , the converse is clearly seen ; the result is certainly more like wilson than naive , and in this case the extrapolation procedure has forced an increase .",
    "another observation is that the gauge non - invariant calculation approaches the continuum result more rapidly than either wilson or naive formulations .",
    "it is clear from our results that there are doublers on random lattices when gauge invariance is maintained at finite lattice spacing , since the extrapolated determinant is comparable to that of naive fermions .",
    "it can also be seen that the doubling can be avoided if one gives up gauge invariance ( but needs and hopes to recover it in the continuum limit , as is in the case we studied above ) .    in all cases ,",
    "the lattice fermion actions are invariant under the global axial transformations .",
    "when there are doublers on random lattices , the axial anomalies are canceled in the usual manner among opposite - chirality species .",
    "when there is no doubling in the gauge non - invariant formulation , the conserved lattice current being the noether current of axial symmetry is , of course , not gauge invariant .",
    "thus it can not be identified with the continuum axial current which is invariant .",
    "it should be , instead , identified with a combination of the continuum current and a gauge - noninvariant term , whose divergence gives us the axial anomalies , @xmath27    we believe that the results obtained here are also applicable to other kinds of random lattices .",
    "our doubling conclusion for random lattices is not plainly disappointing but also points to some serious implications .",
    "the failure of random lattices to accommodate chiral fermions could either undermine the point of view that at the planck scale or higher the structure of spacetime is that of randomness ; or , taken with other complete failures in dealing with chiral fermions , could be a hint that our understanding of chiral gauge theories is incomplete . and , correspondingly , the quantisation of those theories is in need of further studies .",
    "one of us has been pursuing this latter path@xcite .",
