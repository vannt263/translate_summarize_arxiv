    "<S> we report the free layer switching field distributions of spin - valve nanopillars with perpendicular magnetization . while the distributions are consistent with a thermal activation model , they show a strong asymmetry between the parallel to antiparallel and the reverse transition , with energy barriers more than 50  % higher for the parallel to antiparallel transitions . the inhomogeneous dipolar field from the polarizer is demonstrated to be at the origin of this symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the symmetry is restored for devices with a lithographically defined notch pair removed from the midpoint of the pillar cross - section along the ellipse long axis . </S>",
    "<S> these results have important implications for the thermal stability of perpendicular magnetized mram bit cells .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetization reversal in magnetic nanostructures has been studied extensively , both to gain a better understanding of the underlying magnetic interactions @xcite , as well as to optimize the energy barrier for magnetic storage applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nanopillars with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are of particular importance to mram applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the all - perpendicular geometry yields reduced critical currents , high stability and good efficiency ( e.g. , small @xmath0/u ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this geometry also gives rise to an out - of - plane dipole field from the polarizer , which can shift the center of the free layer minor hysteresis loop by a considerable fraction of the room temperature coercive field .    </S>",
    "<S> generally the interactions between layers in a spin - valve are described by a single dipole field . </S>",
    "<S> this consideration is sufficient to understand the shift of the center of free layer minor hysteresis loops and is relevant to determine regions of bistability for spintronic applications . </S>",
    "<S> however , the field from a uniformly magnetized polarizer at the height of the free layer may vary by more than 100  % between the center and the edges of a spin - valve nanopillar . </S>",
    "<S> the inhomogeneity of the polarizer field may play a larger role in the reversal of the free layer than can be described by a single dipole field . </S>",
    "<S> this can be addressed through study of the statistics of magnetization reversal for different transitions of the free layer with respect to a fixed polarizing layer magnetization .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we present switching field distributions for switching the free layer in all - perpendicular magnetized spin - valve nanopillars . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the probability of switching as a function of applied fields under a linearly ramped external field . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant switching field distributions are strongly dependent upon the rate of thermally activated magnetization switching , which depends sensitively on the energy barriers separating metastable and stable magnetization states . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that switching field distributions are a powerful tool to investigate the reversal transitions of a nanomagnet and show the influence of sample geometry and orientation of the polarizer magnetization in all - perpendicular spin - valve nanopillars .    </S>",
    "<S> our spin - valve nanopillars are magnetic multilayered films with strong uniaxial anisotropy perpendicular to the plane and have been described previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the free layer is a co / ni multilayer and the polarizing layer is a co / ni co / pt multilayer with a sufficiently higher coercive field to be considered fixed for all of our measurements ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the layer stack is comprised of ta(5)/cu(30)/pt(3)/[co(0.25)/pt(0.52)]@xmath14/co(0.25)/[ni(0.6)/co(0.1)]@xmath12/cu(4)/[co(0.1)/ni(0.6)]@xmath12/co(0.2)/pt(3)/cu(20)/ta(5 ) ( layer thicknesses in nanometers ) . </S>",
    "<S> these films have been patterned into @xmath2 ellipses by a process that combines e - beam and optical lithography . </S>",
    "<S> we will present results on pillars with zero , one or two lithographically defined notch pairs on each side of the long axis of the ellipse , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> quasi - static measurements of the sample magnetoresistance were taken at room temperature using a lock - in detection scheme , with a 10  khz excitation current of @xmath3a  rms ( the room temperature , zero - field switching current , @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> minor loops of the free layer were recorded using a linear ramped magnetic field with a constant rate @xmath5 = 100 mt / s , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> our samples have a room temperature coercivity @xmath6  100  mt and an average dipole field @xmath7  20  mt , which is defined as the shift of the center hysteresis loop at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> switching field distributions were acquired by ramping the applied field many times and recording the total field at which the free layer reverses , defined by the field at which there is a step change in sample resistance . for each sample </S>",
    "<S> studied here , we have recorded over 10,000 switching events for switching parallel ( p ) and antiparallel ( ap ) to the fixed reference layer .    </S>",
    "<S> the survival function @xmath8 for the ap and p states are displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : switching - dists ] . </S>",
    "<S> all data sets are plotted against the absolute value of the net field defined as , @xmath9 = @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> all data sets intersect around 50  % probability , which is by definition of the dipole field @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that for these measurements we should expect identical switching fields for switching parallel or antiparallel to the polarizer , except for a constant shift due to the dipole field of the polarizer . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ap@xmath12p switching field distributions are consistently wider than p@xmath12ap distributions in all devices except for the single notch pair sample . </S>",
    "<S> this effect only depends on the relative orientation between the layers , as we have observed that reversal of the polarizer preserves the asymmetry between ap and p states ( see the table below ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will examine the distributions more closely by fitting the cumulative distributions to a thermal activation model .    at nonzero temperatures </S>",
    "<S> , there is a finite probability that magnetization reversal takes place by thermal activation over a field - dependent energy barrier . assuming thermal activation over a single energy barrier , at fixed temperatures and fields one can define a rate of escape as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the attempt frequency , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is boltzmann s constant . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the energy barrier , @xmath17 is e(h ) = @xmath18 , where @xmath19=1.5 @xcite , @xmath20 is the energy barrier at zero field , and @xmath21 is the zero - temperature coercive field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cumulative probability to remain in a metastable magnetization state under finite field , @xmath22 , is @xmath23}$ ] , where @xmath5 is the ramp rate of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this expression for the probability of not switching the magnetization at finite field has been attributed to kurkijrvi for superconductors and will be termed the kurkijrvi model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : switching - dists ] portrays the kurkijrvi fits to switching field distributions as a function of total applied field .    </S>",
    "<S> consistent with the differences in the measured switching field distributions , the energy barriers that we have extracted from fitting the distributions for @xmath14 = 1  ghz and @xmath5 = 100 mt / s are dissimilar for all transitions except for the single notch pair junction . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are listed for all samples in table [ tab : fitparams ] . </S>",
    "<S> most striking is the dissimilarity between energy barriers for the double notch pair pillar of 67  @xmath24 for ap@xmath12p and 145  @xmath24 for p@xmath12ap transitions ( @xmath25  k ) .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetization switching by coherent rotation should only result in a shift in the coercive field by an amount equal to the averaged polarizer field across the free layer . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been indirectly observed @xcite and more recently confirmed with simulations and imaging that magnetization reversal in thin - film nanomagnets ( cross - sectional areas @xmath26  nm@xmath27 ) proceeds by sub - volume nucleation followed by the propagation of domain walls @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the magnitude and direction of the polarizer dipole field influences the region where magnetization reversal is initiated .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose a simple interpretative model for the asymmetry in reversal starting from ap or p states . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the antiparallel state , the inhomogeneous field assists in nucleation at the far edges going from ap@xmath12p . </S>",
    "<S> then going from p@xmath12ap , the large opposing field at the edges increases the barrier for nucleation at the edges , and therefore nucleation takes place along the edges of the device center , where the polarizer fields are smallest . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively smaller energy barrier obtained for ap@xmath12p is a consequence of distinct reversal processes for ap@xmath12p and p@xmath12ap transitions . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fringe - field ] illustrates the nucleation regions and gradient in the polarizer field along the free layer .    </S>",
    "<S> cc|c||c||c|l & & no notch & single notch & double notch + & & 65 & 56 & 67 ( 70 ) & + & & 96 & 56 & 145 ( 142 ) & + & & 200 & 194 & 195 ( 194 ) & + & & 170 & 194 & 151 ( 154 ) & +    the effect of the lateral geometry can also be considered within this model . </S>",
    "<S> the notches may serve as preferential nucleation sites in certain cases . </S>",
    "<S> for the sample with a single pair of notches , it may be assumed that the free layer always nucleates a reversed domain at the notches , where the gradient of the field is minimal and sharp divergences in the magnetization of the free layer could introduce magnetic instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the single notch pair data provides the only dataset that can be fit with a single coercive field , @xmath21 , which is indicative of identical nucleation regions for ap@xmath12p and p@xmath12ap switching , in which case the dipole field contributions to the total field are equal and opposite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by adding and subtracting the dipole field to the ap@xmath12p and p@xmath12ap switching field data , respectively , the barrier heights are identical . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the sample with two pairs of notches placed along the perimeter confirms our model that the polarizer field influences the region where reversal initiates . </S>",
    "<S> evidence of the asymmetry in ap and p reversal processes is most evident in the distribution widths in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : switching - dists](c ) and barrier heights in table [ tab : fitparams ] , where results for reversing the polarizer magnetization also confirms the significance of the direction of polarizer magnetization in the observed asymmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of dipolar fields on reversal should be relevant in any device where the polarizer field varies considerably across the free layer , giving rise to distinctive switching statistics and reversal pathways . </S>",
    "<S> inhomogeneous fields could be used to stabilize or destabilize micromagnetic states in spin - valve nanostructures . </S>",
    "<S> polarizer fields could also be designed to greatly increase energy barriers . </S>",
    "<S> also , the position of lithographically defined notches can remove the asymmetry in magnetization reversal processes by energetically disfavoring an alternative reversal pathway . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the use of a synthetic antiferromagnetic polarizing layer may help make the reversal more symmetric @xcite or , alternatively , the polarizer layer could be unstructured or patterned on a larger scale than the free layer to render the polarizer field acting on the free layer both smaller and more uniform . </S>"
