    "physicists have long speculated ( at least since the time of p. a. m. dirac @xcite ) about possible variations of the fundamental physical constants .",
    "the fine structure constant , @xmath5 , is especially interesting to test , being dimensionless and accurately known experimentally.[multiblock footnote omitted ]    several attempts to constraint the time variation of @xmath0 have been made in the last years  @xcite .",
    "the methods involved in these computations are quite different and the results are complementary since these calculations limit the variations of @xmath0 at different cosmological times . in the absence of a particular model for the time dependence of @xmath0 , there is no compelling reason to fit it in any particular way . thus , it is important to find limits on the variations of @xmath0 at different epochs . in particular , there may be a strong dependence on the cosmological redshift parameter @xmath6 which could make most direct measurement methods insensitive , whereas an indirect method like the one we are investigating  primordial nucleosynthesis  puts us nearer the epoch of the unknown physics of the big bang itself where certainly the standard model of particle physics is inapplicable .    despite the lack of explicit models for the time variation of @xmath0 , it should be kept in mind that there exist arguments , e.g. , from fundamental theories with extra dimensions  @xcite which support the general idea of non - constancy of the low - energy parameters .",
    "however , models in which the coupling is governed by some condensate that varies in time are not yet fully understood .",
    "in some ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) the dynamics has a `` pre big bang '' phase .",
    "after inflation , the universe is such that the dilaton is already massive and the couplings are set at the bottom of the potential without much further variation .    in another class of models",
    "@xcite the dilaton remain massless but it decouples from matter .",
    "however , t. damour and a. m. polyakov predict possible effects of dilaton - induced changes in @xmath0 and other quantities relevant to primordial nucleosynthesis to be of the order @xmath7 , though in this model other dilaton effects are more important . in view of the primitive state of theory for an eventual time variation of fundamental couplings",
    ", we use a phenomenological approach and assume a different value of @xmath0 than the present one at the time of nucleosynthesis and investigate what the observable consequences would be .",
    "direct measurements in the laboratory have given a limit on the variation @xmath8 over a period of @xmath9 days  @xcite .",
    "astrophysical observations of spectra of high red - shift quasar absorption lines have given limits of @xmath10 for @xmath6 ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the geological limit from the oklo natural nuclear reactor is about @xmath13 over a period of @xmath14 billion years  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was argued that from future observations of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation , variations of @xmath0 could be bound by @xmath15 for @xmath16  @xcite . finally , assuming a particular model for the @xmath0-dependence of the neutron - proton mass difference",
    ", a limit can be extracted from the @xmath3he primordial abundance for @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "this work deals with contraints from nucleosynthesis , which have the advantage of probing the earliest cosmological epoch where data exist and where the basic physical processes are known from laboratory experiments work .",
    "our analysis corrects that of  @xcite and extends it since we have not only considered the @xmath3he abundance but also the abundances of other light nuclei .    besides consituting a more thorough analysis of the nucleosynthesis bounds , our treatment has the advantage of bypassing the difficult theoretical problem of the dependence of the neutron - proton mass difference on @xmath0 , relying on the fact that the other abundances are only weakly sensitive to this mass difference .",
    "the abundance of the other light elements as a function of @xmath0 can be extracted with smaller ambiguity , and the dependence is in addition very steep , in particular for @xmath1li ( at least in certain ranges of the baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath18 ) .",
    "of course , at the present time these advantages are to a large extent balanced by the disadvantage of observationally less well known abundances , something that may hopefully improve in the future .    in the next section we review the most important aspects of the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) model .",
    "then , in section 3 we explain how @xmath0 enters into the sbbn scenario . in section 4",
    ", we study the @xmath0-dependence of the relevant nuclear reactions involved in primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "finally , in section 5 we estimate the corresponding limit placed on @xmath19 at @xmath20 .",
    "we find that , given the present observational uncertainties of light - element abundances , it is not possible to put a more stringent bound than @xmath21 two orders of magnitude less restrictive than the one claimed in @xcite .",
    "in order to give a complete account of the effects of a variation of the fine structure constant on the primordial abundances , we will briefly review the sbbn model .",
    "we will focus our attention on those aspects concerning the evolution of the abundances of light nuclei .",
    "the production of light elements according to the sbbn model is commonly divided into three stages @xcite .    *",
    "first stage : _ statistical equilibrium _",
    "( @xmath22  mev ; @xmath23  sec )    during this first stage ( as in the other two ) , the universe is radiation - dominated .",
    "the relativistic degrees of freedom are photons , electrons , positrons and the three light neutrino species .",
    "the weak interactions that interconvert neutrons and protons , i.e. , @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 are rapid enough to keep them in statistical equilibrium .",
    "the neutron - to - proton ratio is , then , given by its equilibrium value ( we use units such that the speed of light , planck s constant and boltzmann s constant are all set to unity ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the neutron - proton mass difference .",
    "moreover , at this temperature , not only are the rates for the weak reactions  ( [ eq : n > pev])([eq : ne > pv ] ) faster than the universe expansion rate , but so are the nuclear reaction rates responsible for the production of light elements .",
    "light nuclei are then both in kinetic and chemical equilibrium or nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) , their corresponding abundances being given by  @xcite @xmath29 a^{\\frac{5}{2 } } \\left ( \\frac{t}{m_n } \\right ) ^{3(a-1)/2 } & \\times \\nonumber\\\\ & \\eta ^{a-1 } y_p^z y_n^{a - z } \\exp ( b_a / t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the present baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath30 is the nucleon mass , @xmath31 is the binding energy , @xmath32 counts the number of degrees of freedom of the nuclear species @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the riemann zeta function .. ]    due to the fact that the number density of photons is so large relative to that of baryons ( @xmath35 ) , the abundances of composite elements are completely negligible and their synthesis does not truly start at this epoch .    *",
    "second stage : _ neutron - proton `` freeze - out '' _",
    "( @xmath36  mev ; @xmath37  sec )    after neutrino decoupling , at about the time electron - positron pairs annihilate , the second stage of primordial nucleosynthesis takes place .",
    "the weak reactions  ( [ eq : n > pev])([eq : ne > pv ] ) become slower than the expansion rate of the universe and the neutron - to - proton ratio is no longer able to track its equilibrium value : it `` freezes - out '' .    after this freeze - out",
    ", the neutron - to - proton ratio can be approximated by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the freeze - out temperature , which is determined by setting the equality between the expansion and the weak rates .",
    "note that , since the weak rates depend on @xmath40 , also @xmath41 depends implicitly on it .",
    "but while reactions  ( [ eq : n > pev])([eq : ne > pv ] ) are too slow to track the rate of expansion , nuclear reactions are still fast enough to keep light elements in nse and , thus , their abundances are still very small .",
    "it is not until the third and last stage that nuclear production effectively begins .    *",
    "third stage : _ light - element synthesis _",
    "( @xmath42  mev @xmath43  mev ;  @xmath12  sec  @xmath44  min )    shortly before this time , electron - positron pairs have finally annihilated , transferring their entropy to the photons and increasing their temperature relative to that of the neutrinos by a factor @xmath45 .",
    "so , at this last stage the only relativistic species are the neutrinos and the photons",
    ".    the neutron - to - proton ratio does not remain really constant after the freeze - out but it continues to decrease during this stage from its freeze - out value because of neutron decay and the effect of the strong neutron - proton reactions .",
    "actually , it will only be at @xmath46  mev , when practically all available neutrons are bound into nuclei , that the neutron - to - proton ratio becomes constant .",
    "but the most important feature of this period is that , while in the previous stage only weak processes were relevant , at this epoch strong and electromagnetic interactions get important and nucleosynthesis begins .",
    "the evolution of light - element abundances is dominated by the competition between the nuclear reaction rates and the expansion rate .",
    "although the densities of the light `` fuels '' for the reactions involved in the process are now significant , they eventually are not big enough to keep up with the demand for the nse of heavier elements .",
    "moreover , coulomb - barrier suppression becomes gradually more important .",
    "both effects result in the freeze - out of nuclear reactions and the consequent series of departures of light nuclei from their nse states .",
    "let us describe the process in detail , following  @xcite .",
    "the most abundant nucleus , @xmath3he , is to an excellent approximation produced only through the mass-3 nuclei , @xmath47he and tritium ( @xmath48 ) , and it is only through these nuclei and the reactions @xmath47he@xmath49he and @xmath50he that it is allowed to be in nse . at temperatures greater than @xmath42",
    "mev , the @xmath47he and @xmath48 abundances are sufficiently large to allow @xmath3he to track its equilibrium value . but at @xmath51  mev , the nse curves of the mass-3 nuclei cross with that of @xmath3he , with the @xmath3he abundance rising faster than those for @xmath47he and @xmath48 . at about this temperature , also , the reactions that maintain @xmath3he in equilibrium become too slow , @xmath3he is forced to leave its nse curve and follows instead the corresponding @xmath47he and @xmath48 nse tracks .",
    "this goes on until @xmath52  mev .",
    "at this temperature @xmath47he and @xmath48 also encounter a bottleneck , a `` minor '' deuterium ( @xmath53 ) bottleneck : reactions @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which keep @xmath53 in nse with the mass-3 nuclei slow down and now @xmath3he , @xmath47he and @xmath48 follow the @xmath53 nse curve .    at @xmath56  mev , the @xmath47he@xmath57 reaction freezes - out and the mass-3 nuclei lose their nse too .",
    "finally , all the elements encounter the  major \" deuterium bottleneck at @xmath58  mev and after that the nuclear species evolve in quasi - statistical equilibrium .    some @xmath1li and some @xmath1be",
    "are synthesized , but due to the existence of energy gaps among stable nuclei at mass numbers @xmath59 and @xmath60 and significant coulomb - barrier suppression at this time , the production of nuclei beyond @xmath60 is inhibited .",
    "we are now able to discuss which are the most important @xmath0-dependent magnitudes that affect primordial abundances .    during the first two stages of sbbn , the only @xmath0-dependent parameters are the weak reaction rates  ( [ eq : n > pev])([eq : ne > pv ] ) , which in turn determine the the freeze - out temperature @xmath61 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : n / p|eq ] ) ) , the neutron - proton mass difference @xmath62 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : n / p|eq ] ) ) and the binding energies @xmath31 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : nseabun ] ) ) .    since the abundances of composite nuclei during these stages are by themselves negligible , the effects of a small variation in their binding energies are negligible too .    but this is not the case with the weak reactions  ( [ eq : n >",
    "pev])([eq : ne > pv ] ) and with the neutron - proton mass difference . since almost all available neutrons after freeze - out",
    "are finally bound into @xmath3he , in a good approximation its abundance is given by @xmath63    from this equation and eq .",
    "( [ eq : n / p|fo ] ) it follows that the main parameters that fix the final value of @xmath64 are precisely @xmath40 and @xmath39 .",
    "radiative and coulomb corrected expressions for the weak reactions  ( [ eq : n > pev])([eq : ne > pv ] ) have been calculated in @xcite and it was shown that their corrections to primordial abundances are very small.he , of about @xmath65 . ] the effect on @xmath41 of a variation in @xmath0 is then given only through the variation of @xmath66 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "that means that @xmath64 depends just on a single @xmath0-dependent parameter , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "this fact makes the constraint on @xmath0 estimated from the @xmath3he primordial abundance very model - dependent : a particular model for the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath40 is needed to estimate the change in @xmath64 due to a change in @xmath0 .",
    "one may also note that changes in the other gauge coupling constants , such as the strong coupling @xmath67 , may induce changes that are even more important , but more difficult to compute than those of a changing @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "as an example of the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath40 , we have used the treatment of j. gasser and h. leutwyler @xcite , from which we deduce @xmath68    this method is a phenomenological way to evolve the mass of the nucleon as determined by the change of quark masses due to their strong and electromagnetic energy and the electromagnetic binding .",
    "it is a qualitatively reasonable method but has no fundamental qcd backing .",
    "other abundances are not so sensitive to @xmath40 as @xmath64 : because of its large binding energy , @xmath3he acts as a `` sink '' during primordial nucleosynthesis , its abundance is less sensitive to changes in the nuclear reaction rates than the other abundances , and more sensitive to variations in the parameters that fix the number of neutrons relative to the number of protons , i.e. , @xmath40 and @xmath39 .",
    "we note , following  @xcite , that the dimensionful weak ( fermi ) coupling constant @xmath69 does not depend on the gauge coupling constant in the standard electroweak model .",
    "this means that we should use the other light - element abundances to limit @xmath70 , in addition to the @xmath3he abundance , bypassing the problem of the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath40 .",
    "our next step is , then , to analyze the role of @xmath0 during the third stage .",
    "the fine structure constant affects the third stage because it enters into the expressions of the nuclear reaction rates : as we have already mentioned , coulomb - barrier penetration is a determining factor during nucleosynthesis . to implement the changes in @xmath0 in these expressions we first need to know exactly the way by which thermonuclear reaction rates are obtained from experimental data .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the rate of a nonrelativistic nuclear reaction taking place in a nondegenerate environment is as usual given as the thermal average of the product of the corresponding cross section @xmath71 and the relative velocity times the number densities of the particles involved : @xmath72    under the assumption that these particles have isotropic maxwell - boltzmann kinetic energy distributions this average can be written as  @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the reduced mass .    for charged - particle induced reactions  @xcite .",
    "] the cross section is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the cross section factor or the astrophysical @xmath77-factor and @xmath78 is the sommerfeld parameter : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the gamow energy and @xmath81 , @xmath82 the electric charges of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the reason for introducing this factorization for the cross section is the fact that , because of the exponential energy dependence of the coulomb barrier penetrability , charged - particle cross sections are extremely difficult to measure at low energies .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to extrapolate @xmath71 from experimental data to lower energies .",
    "since the exponential factor is given by solid quantum mechanical principles , only the unknown nuclear physics part @xmath76 has to be fitted , and it is generally a slowly varying function of energy .",
    "let us first consider the non - resonant terms of the reactions 112 ( see tables  [ tab : summary ] and  [ tab : summary2 ] ) . because of its slow variation with energy , we can expand @xmath76 as a taylor series : @xmath83    when inserted into eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmav ] ) this gives @xmath84 where @xmath85 and where @xmath86    introduce further @xmath87 . at low temperatures compared with the coulomb threshold ,",
    "these `` astrophysical '' integrals are given by  @xcite @xmath88 @xmath89 and , finally @xmath90    from these expressions it is straightforward to obtain the @xmath0-dependence of the non - resonant contributions to the reaction rates we are treating .",
    "we have not considered the @xmath0-dependence of the reduced mass @xmath74 and of @xmath76 and its derivatives about the zero energy since this dependence obeys a polinomial law on @xmath0  @xcite and it can be safely neglected .    for reactions 3 , 5 , 7 and 8 the non - resonant terms are predicted to have a combination of polynomial and decreasing exponential terms  @xcite ; so , expressions like @xmath91 where @xmath92 is , again , a slowly varying function of the energy , must be included into the @xmath77-factor . for most of the cases we are considering , a very good approximation results when",
    "@xmath92 is assumed to be a constant , i.e. , @xmath93 .",
    "then an additional term of the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 , appears in the expressions of the corresponding reaction rates .",
    "however , for reaction 3 , @xmath97 is assumed to be of the form @xmath98 and then the effective temperature @xmath99 is also an @xmath0-dependent parameter :    @xmath100    continuum and/or narrow and broad resonant terms appear in the expressions for the rates of reactions 46 , 11 and 12 .",
    "these terms are generally of the form  @xcite @xmath101 where @xmath102 is about the continuum threshold energy or the resonance energy , respectively , and @xmath103 is a function of the temperature .",
    "but since the electromagnetic contribution to these energies is very small compared with the strong contribution , we can safely neglect their @xmath0-dependence .",
    "finally , reactions 4 , 5 , 11 and 12 have in addition a cut - off factor for the non - resonant terms of the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a cut - off temperature . from  @xcite",
    "it follows that this temperature is roughly proportional to @xmath106 .    in tables",
    "[ tab : summary ] and  [ tab : summary2 ] we have explicitly shown the relevant dependence on @xmath0 for all the charged - particle induced reactions having an impact on primordial abundance changes . for the relative change in the value of @xmath0 , we define the quantity @xmath107 : @xmath108",
    "using the theoretical framework we have described we proceed to see what is the effect of varying @xmath0 on the relative abundances .",
    "we do use the newest version of the sbbn code @xcite to implement these variations .",
    "we keep all other coupling constants fixed and assume no other `` exotic '' effects are present , like strong primordial magnetic fields .",
    "we discuss these effects below .",
    "we have performed several tests to see that the code is working correctly .",
    "we use a neutron lifetime of @xmath109  sec , which is the currently accepted value according to the particle data group  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : yvseta ] we show the results for the final abundances of the observationally interesting elements @xmath3he , @xmath47he , @xmath53 and @xmath1li as a function of @xmath18 , for sbbn and for a 5 % increase or decrease of the value of @xmath0 during nucleosynthesis . in figs .",
    "[ fig : dvseta][fig : li7vseta ] the results for the abundances are shown separately on an expanded scale . as can be seen , the fractional change in the @xmath3he abundance is quite insensitive to the value of @xmath18 , as are the other abundances with the notable exception of @xmath1li .",
    "this is due to the two competing mechanisms for @xmath1li production , i.e. , for @xmath110 , @xmath1li is produced by @xmath3he@xmath111li , a process in which the coulomb - barrier is not as significant ( but where the change in @xmath40 caused by a change in @xmath0 is ) as in the reaction @xmath3he@xmath112he@xmath113be , which , followed by decay of @xmath1be to @xmath1li , is the dominant reaction that synthesizes @xmath1li for @xmath114 .",
    "actually , the of @xmath18 coming from a comparison between the predictions of standard nucleosynthesis and observational data is presently quite uncertain , as is exemplified by the differing recent analyses of the problem in sbbn @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", a combined analysis gives @xmath115 ( driven largely by accepting a high value of the deuterium abundance ) , whereas in  @xcite a low deuterium abundance is taken as the preferred observational result leading to a value @xmath116 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyvsda ] the fractional changes in the light - element abundances are shown versus the assumed fractional change in @xmath0 for both these values of @xmath18 .    in the case of the low value of @xmath117 , the @xmath1li abundance does not vary as strongly with a changing @xmath0 , and since this abundance is known less accurately than that of @xmath3he it is the latter which has to be used to bound possible variations of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the observational status @xmath3he is still a matter of debate , and it does not seem likely that the systematic errors are larger than usually quoted .",
    "for instance , the global fit referred to in  @xcite is @xmath118 whereas the corresponding value in a recent reanalysis by izotov et al .",
    "@xcite is given as @xmath119    using the second upper limit and the first lower limit for the @xmath3he abundance , as is difficult to avoid before better data become available , we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : li7vseta ] ( a ) that a reduction of the value of @xmath0 larger than 5 % is not excluded , if @xmath3he is considered alone , and the other abundances are only used to generously bound @xmath18 to be in the interval @xmath120 .",
    "interestingly , one may note that on the contrary an increase of the electromagnetic strength by @xmath121 % would relieve the pressure these low-@xmath18 models feel from the upward revision of the @xmath3he abundance of  @xcite , while still falling in the allowed range for @xmath1li discussed below .",
    "of course , we have to remember the fact that the change in @xmath3he is caused by the model - dependent variation of the neutron - proton mass difference with @xmath0 .    for the high value of @xmath116",
    ", we see that a decrease of @xmath0 by 2 % is within our allowed range of the @xmath3he abundance ( the change in deuterium caused by such a change in @xmath0 does not affect very much the @xmath18 value assigned to a given deuterium measurement ) .",
    "since for the high @xmath18 solution the variation of @xmath1li with @xmath0 is rapid , we have to consider the observational data for lithium .",
    "unfortunately , the situation is less than clear here as well .",
    "it seems that the data are well described by a `` plateau '' value versus metallicity , given by  @xcite @xmath122    the fact that there is little dispersion around this value could indicate that it represents the primordial abundance .",
    "however , lithium could be destroyed by stellar processes by an unknown amount , which has led some workers in the field  @xcite to consider the possibility that the true primordial value is up to a factor of 2 larger .",
    "it is interesting to note from fig .",
    "[ fig : yvseta ] that the @xmath1li abundance for this value of @xmath18 can be brought down to @xmath123 if the strength of @xmath0 was larger by around 3 % than the standard value ( thus making the coulomb suppression stronger ) . for the same change of @xmath0 , the @xmath3he abundance is , however , violating our ( model - dependent ) upper bound by a considerable amount .",
    "thus , we conclude that the high-@xmath18 solution , which already has problems explaining @xmath1li ( if ( [ eq : li ] ) represents the primordial value ) can not be improved by changing @xmath0 , in contrast to the low-@xmath18 solution which may benefit from an increase of @xmath0 by a couple of percent during nucleosynthesis .",
    "the successful first - order comparison between big bang nucleosynthesis predictions and observed abundances implies that the values of the fundamental coupling constants at that epoch can not have been too much different from the present ones .",
    "when it comes to more precise statements , the situation is complicated by the presently partially conflicting measurements .",
    "( similar conclusions have recently been obtained concerning possible limits on the effective number of neutrino species during nucleosynthesis @xcite . )",
    "we argue that it is impossible to quote a better bound than @xmath121 % on the deviation from the present value of @xmath0 at the time of nucleosynthesis , and note that such a variation may even be implied , if the deuterium observations leading to the low-@xmath18 solution are confirmed with increased significance , and the trend continues of an increasing value for @xmath3he from observations .",
    "a new ingredient in our treatment is the discovery of the large sensitivity , especially at high values of @xmath18 , of the @xmath1li abundance on the electromagnetic strength , due to exponential coulomb barriers .",
    "if the experimental and theoretical situation is improved for this isotope , it holds the promise of giving the most stringent bound on variation of @xmath0 , with the added virtue that it is less sensitive to model assumptions than , e.g. , @xmath3he .",
    "the problem that the high-@xmath18 ( low deuterium ) solution may have in explaining the low plateau value of @xmath1li can in principle be solved by an increase in @xmath0 by a few percent , but only if the true primordial @xmath3he abundance is well above @xmath11 ( or if @xmath40 depends on @xmath0 in a different way than we have assumed ) .",
    "it is of interest to notice that other exotic effects such as the presence of strong primordial magnetic fields mainly affect the @xmath3he abundance  @xcite and not li or the other elements .",
    "also in this respect the signal given by @xmath1li is clearer .",
    "the limit obtained here is about the same as the one potentially given by the recombination time test @xcite , but probably more significant since it is at a higher redshift .",
    "however , at the time when the microwave background was emitted , the universe was totally dominated by gravity and electromagnetic interactions from which it can be argued that it offers a less model - dependent test .",
