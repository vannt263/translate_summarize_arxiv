    "in the modern information age , one often faces the need to online monitor large - scale data streams with the aim of offering the potential for early detection of a  trigger \" event .",
    "ideally , one would like to develop a global monitoring scheme that can detect the occurring event as quickly as possible while controlling the system - wise global false alarm rate . from the statistical point of view , this is a sequential change - point detection or quickest change detection problem , which has a variety of applications such as industrial quality control , signal detection and biosurveillance . the classical version of this problem , where one monitors independent and identically distributed ( iid ) _ univariate _ or _ low - dimensional multivariate _",
    "observations from a single data stream , is a well - developed area , and many classical procedures have been developed such as the shewhart s chart ( shewhart @xcite ) , moving average control charts , page s cusum procedure ( page @xcite ) , shiryaev - roberts procedure ( shiryaev @xcite , roberts @xcite ) , window - limited procedures ( lai @xcite ) and scan statistics ( glaz , naus and wallenstein @xcite ) .",
    "all these classical procedures not only hold attractive theoretical properties , but also are computationally simple . see , for example , lorden @xcite , pollak @xcite , moustakides @xcite , lai @xcite , kulldorff @xcite . for a review ,",
    "see the books such as basseville and nikiforov @xcite , poor and hadjiliadis @xcite , tartakovsky , nikiforov , and basseville @xcite .",
    "however , research is limited in the context of monitoring large - scale data streams , especially when the occurring event might affect some , but not all , local data streams .",
    "the only exception is probably xie and siegmund @xcite , but their proposed schemes are computationally heavy with large local memory requirements to store past information , and thus is computationally infeasible for online monitoring large - scale data streams over long time period .",
    "indeed , while many classical likelihood - ratio - based quickest change detection methods can be extended from one or low dimension to high - dimension or large - scale data streams , they are generally computationally infeasible in the context of large - scale data streams . as mentioned in breiman @xcite , in order for the profession of statistics to remain healthy , more algorithm - based methods should be developed .",
    "this is exactly what needs to be done in the subfield of quickest change detection or sequential change - point detection .",
    "we feel that the current main bottleneck is on the algorithm or methodology aspect , and in particular , new ideas and new approaches are needed to develop efficient _ scalable _ global schemes in the sense of being able to be implemented for monitoring large - scale data streams over a long period of time .",
    "the purpose of this article is to present a general and flexible approach that can provide efficient scalable global schemes when monitoring large - scale data streams .",
    "our research is motivated by parallel and distributed computing and networks .",
    "a motivating example is censoring sensor networks in engineering , which was introduced by rago , willett , and bar - shalom @xcite and later by appadwedula , veeravalli , and jones @xcite and tay , tsitsiklis , and win @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mei1 ] illustrates the general setting of a widely used configuration of censoring sensor networks , in which the data streams @xmath1 s are observed at the remote , distributed sensors , but the final decision is made at a central location , called the fusion center .",
    "the key feature of such a network is that while sensing ( i.e. , taking observations at the local sensors ) are generally cheap and affordable , communication between remote sensors and fusion center is expensive in terms of both energy and limited bandwidth .",
    "the question then becomes how the fusion center can still monitor the system effectively under the networks resource constraints .",
    "a more concrete example is the national syndromic surveillance program biosense platform at the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , where the computing power and memory of any centralized server would have become limited as compared to _",
    "daily _ summary data from all state and local health departments as well as many hospitals , and thus the cdc s biosense platform is designed to be a distributed computing system that can make a global decision .",
    "[ fig : mei1 ]        to develop scalable schemes for distributed monitoring large - scale data streams , we propose to take advantage of parallel computing and the fact that many efficient and computationally simple local procedures are available to detect changes in local data streams . to be more specific ,",
    "suppose we are monitoring a large number @xmath2 of data streams , and for each local data stream , we can construct a local detection procedure based upon some local detection statistics that can be computed recursively over time @xmath3 , e.g. , involving @xmath4 computations and @xmath4 memory requirements at each time .",
    "then our proposed methodology is to run these @xmath2 local procedures in parallel before combining them into a global monitoring scheme .",
    "hence it only requires @xmath5 computations and @xmath5 memory requirements at each time step when new observations are taken , thereby yielding a scalable global monitoring scheme .",
    "while the parallel local monitoring approach sounds interesting , one allegation often made is that we will lose much information at the global level if we combine local detection procedures , not raw observation themselves , to make a global decision .",
    "indeed , two specific methods have been developed in the literature to combine local detection procedures , but both have shortcomings : a naive method is to raise an alarm at the global level whenever any local detection procedure raises a local alarm , and the other method is developed in mei @xcite to raise a global alarm when the sum of local detection statistics is too large . both methods are known to be inefficient when only a few ( unknown ) subset of data streams are affected , see mei @xcite and xie and siegmund @xcite .    in this article , we demonstrate that the problem is not on the parallel local monitoring approach itself , but on how to combine the local detection procedures suitably in the scenario when only a few ( unknown ) subset of data streams are affected .",
    "our key idea is to filter out those unchanging local data streams and to make a global decision based on those likely affected data streams . for that purpose , we propose sum - shrinkage techniques to combine the local detection statistics ( in the log - likelihood ratio scale ) of the local detection procedures together to make an efficient global decision .",
    "it is worth pointing out that a well - known view in the standard off - line statistical inference literature is the necessity of shrinkage for high - dimensional data in order to improve power or efficiency .",
    "thus , from the methodology point of view , our proposed methodologies are analogous to those off - line statistical methods such as ( adaptive ) truncation , and soft- and hard- thresholding , see neyman @xcite , donoho and johnstone @xcite , fan and lin @xcite .",
    "also see cands @xcite and the references there . however , our motivation here is different and our application to quickest change detection or sequential change - point detection is new .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present our proposed",
    " sum - shrinkage \" methodology under a general setting of monitoring large - scale independent data streams and also discuss two existing methodologies for parallel local monitoring .",
    "we exemplify our methodology in two concrete examples : section 3 considers the censoring sensor networks when the local data streams may or may not be homogeneous but the pre - change and post - change distributions of local data streams are given , and section 4 investigates a more complicated scenario when the post - change distributions of local data streams involve unknown parameters . in both sections 3 and 4 , numerical monte carlo simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the performance of our proposed methods .",
    "section 5 includes the proofs of theorems [ theorem1 ] and [ theorem2 ] that justify the choices of tuning / censoring parameters in censoring sensor networks .",
    "let us present our proposed methodology under a general setting , and two specific examples will be given in later sections .",
    "assume there are @xmath2 data streams in a system .",
    "@xmath6 initially , the system is  in control \" , but at some _ unknown _ time @xmath7 an undesired event may occur and affect a few unknown local data streams in the sense of changing the local distributions of the @xmath1 s .",
    "here we assume that the online monitoring is conducted under the _ unstructured _ environment in the sense that we do not make any assumptions to relate the occurring event to the local data streams , see tartakovsky et al .",
    "@xcite , mei @xcite and xie and siegmund @xcite .",
    "also see lvy - leduc and roueff @xcite for an application of the unstructured problem to anomaly detection in computer networks .",
    "in particular , we focus on the scenario when the occurring event changes the local distributions of affected local data streams , and we do not aim to detect changes on the correlation between different data streams . hence , the data @xmath1 s will be assumed to be independent across different data streams , but can be flexible otherwise .",
    "for instance , the @xmath1 s may or may not be identically distributed across different local data streams , can be dependent over time within each local data stream , and can be _ univariate _ or _ low - dimensional multivariate_. we should mention that the assumption of the independence across different data streams is standard in the unstructured problem , see tartakovsky et al .",
    "@xcite , mei @xcite and xie and siegmund @xcite .",
    "this is not as restrictive as one thought in many practical applications , as the @xmath1 s can be chosen as the residuals of some spatio - temporal models rather than the original raw data .",
    "in other words , one can first pre - process the data , build a spatio - temporal baseline model when the system is in control , calculate the corresponding residuals , and then monitor the residuals @xmath1 s .",
    "for an illustration , see xie , huang and willett @xcite , and liu , mei and shi @xcite , to monitor the residuals of dependent data in two real - world applications in solar flare and hot - forming process .    for the purpose of generalization ,",
    "we do not specify which kind of local changes these @xmath2 data streams may have .",
    "instead we assume that there is a local detection statistic @xmath8 ( in the log - likelihood scale ) for the @xmath9-th local data stream at each time step @xmath3 that summarizes the evidence regarding a possible local change based on the first @xmath3 local observations @xmath10 for each @xmath11 it is important that the @xmath8 s not only can detect local changes quickly , depending on specific assumptions on the local changes and local data distribution model , but also can be computed recursively .",
    "we should emphasize that it can be highly non - trivial to construct such @xmath8 s , especially when the local post - change distributions involve unknown parameters or when missing data are present , see our example in section 4 and liu , mei and shi @xcite .",
    "here we assume , for a moment , that such @xmath8 s have been constructed , and our focus is the parallel local monitoring method that combines these local detection statistics @xmath8 s together to make an efficient global decision .    before presenting our proposed methodology ,",
    "let us first review the definition of global false alarm rate and two existing methods for parallel local monitoring . when monitoring @xmath2 independent data streams in ( [ eqn01 ] ) , it is well - known in statistics that even if each local false alarm rate is well controlled , the global false alarm rate can be significant when the number @xmath2 of data streams is large . in the literature of sequential change - point detection , for a global monitoring scheme that raise an alarm at time @xmath12 its global false alarm rate",
    "is often evaluated by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the expectation of @xmath15 when the system is  in control , \" and is often called the average run length to false alarm . a standard global false alarm constraint is to require a global monitoring scheme with a stopping time @xmath15 satisfying @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a pre - specified constant .",
    "the rigorous definition of the detection delay of the scheme @xmath15 will be postponed later in next section .",
    "there are two existing methods for parallel local monitoring .",
    "the first one is to raise an alarm at the global level whenever any local detection procedures raises a local alarm .",
    "if we normalize the local detection statistics @xmath8 s , this can be rewritten as raising an alarm at the global level at time @xmath18 ( @xmath19 if such @xmath3 does not exist ) where @xmath20 is a pre - specified constant . below we will call the scheme in ( [ eq3n02 ] ) the  max \" scheme .",
    "the second method is the  sum \" scheme developed in mei @xcite that is defined by the stopping time @xmath21 ( @xmath19 if such @xmath3 does not exist ) . as mentioned in mei @xcite ,",
    "max \" scheme @xmath22 in ( [ eq3n02 ] ) works well when one or very few data streams are affected , whereas the  sum \" scheme @xmath23 in ( [ eq3n03 ] ) works well only when many data streams are affected . here and below the threshold @xmath24 of a scheme @xmath25 is a pre - specified constant so that the scheme @xmath25 satisfies the false alarm constraint @xmath26 in ( [ eq000002 ] ) .",
    "now we are ready to present our proposed methodology under a general setting .",
    "we suggest to define the global monitoring statistic of the general  sum - shrinkage \" form @xmath27 where @xmath28 are some suitable shrinkage transformation functions .",
    "then our proposed sum - shrinkage scheme raises a global alarm at the time @xmath29 intuitively , the shrinkage functions @xmath30 s in ( [ shrinkage ] ) play the role of dimension reduction by automatically filtering out those non - changing local data streams and by focusing only on those local data streams that appear to be affected by the occurring event .",
    "in addition , as an extension , the proposed sum - shrinkage scheme @xmath31 enjoys the nice properties of the sum scheme @xmath23 in ( [ eq3n03 ] ) : it does not assume that all local data streams are affected by the occurring event simultaneously , and thus can be very useful when there may be a time delay before the event affects different local data streams , or when different local data streams involve local changes at different time steps . also see mei @xcite and xie and siegmund @xcite for more discussions .",
    "evidently a suitable choice of the @xmath30 s in the sum - shrinkage monitoring statistic @xmath32 in ( [ shrinkage ] ) will depend on the assumptions and contexts of applications . in sections 3 and 4 below",
    "we will demonstrate the following three shrinkage transformations of the form @xmath33 the rationale and motivations of these three transformations will be given in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "of course , besides those in ( [ hard])-([order ] ) , there are many other kinds of the shrinkage functions such as @xmath34 also by semi - bayesian arguments , the transformation @xmath35 $ ] is proposed and used in the schemes of xie and siegmund @xcite in a completely different manner under their setting",
    ".    we should emphasize that our proposed sum - shrinkage schemes can be easily implemented in the distributed network systems as long as the local detection statistics @xmath8 s can be easily computed at local data streams . besides the two examples in the next two sections , we should point out that our proposed ",
    "sum - shrinkage \" methodology in ( [ shrinkage])-([shrinkage2 ] ) has a broad range of other applications .",
    "for instance , the local detection statistics @xmath8 s can be defined for dependent observations such as those from the recursive schemes in fuh and mei @xcite for hidden markov models , or those from the non - parametric detection schemes in gorden and pollak @xcite , depending on which kind of local models or local changes we are interested in .",
    "in addition , little information seems to be lost if we do not observe those local data streams with small values of @xmath8 s since they make limited contributions in our proposed global monitoring statistic @xmath32 in ( [ shrinkage ] ) .",
    "this motivated liu , mei and shi @xcite to develop an efficient adaptive sensor relocation policy when one only has ability to observe @xmath36 out of @xmath2 data streams at each time step .",
    "this may occur in manufacturing process control when there are @xmath2 possible stages in the process but there are only @xmath36 expensive sensors available to monitor the process . in such a problem",
    ", the order - thresholding transformation can be combined with missing data techniques to be used not only in the global monitoring statistic @xmath32 in ( [ shrinkage ] ) for quickest detection , but also in a greedy manner to adaptively observe those @xmath36 data streams with the largest @xmath8 s values at each time step .",
    "we feel the spirit of sum - shrinkage can have many other applications , and hopefully our research opens new research opportunities and directions , especially on monitoring large - scale data streams .",
    "below we will provide some general guidelines on how to use our proposed sum - shrinkage scheme @xmath31 in ( [ shrinkage2 ] ) .",
    "the performance of our proposed scheme will depend on two components : one is the local detection statistics @xmath8 s and the other is the shrinkage transformation functions @xmath30 s .",
    "the suitable choices of these two components depend on the applications and contexts , and will be demonstrated in the next two sections .    in general",
    ", the local detection statistics @xmath8 s should be able to efficiently detect local changes we are interested in , and ideally can also be recursively computed over time so that the local computation is simple .",
    "such a choice of the @xmath8 s might be straightforward in some applications ( i.e. , section 3 ) , but can be highly non - trival in other cases ( e.g. , section 4 ) . also see liu , mei and shi @xcite how to define @xmath8 s when the observations from some data streams are missing or unobservable .    for the choice of the shrinkage transformation @xmath37 s",
    ", the situation can be complicated when the data streams are nonhomogeneous ( or the @xmath8 s have different properties for different @xmath9 s ) .",
    "one rule of thumb is to choose @xmath37 s so that the local procedures based upon nonhomogeneous @xmath8 s will raise local alarms at roughly same time steps for all affected data streams , see our example in section 3 .    given the choices of the local detection statistics @xmath8 s and the shrinkage transformation @xmath37 s , an important remaining question is how to determine the global threshold @xmath24 in ( [ shrinkage2 ] ) so that the proposed sum - shrinkage scheme @xmath31 in ( [ shrinkage2 ] ) satisfies the global false alarm constraint @xmath26 in ( [ eq000002 ] ) .",
    "in general this is nontrivial , as it requires one to accurately characterize the relationship between the threshold @xmath24 and the false alarm constraint @xmath38 when the dimension @xmath2 goes to @xmath39 intuitively , the global monitoring statistic @xmath32 in ( [ shrinkage ] ) is the sum of @xmath2 ( independent ) random variables , one would expect that the central limited theorem ( clt ) will be useful when the shrinkage transformation keeps most non - zero values , e.g. , the hard - thresholding or soft - thresholding transformations in ( [ hard ] ) or ( [ soft ] ) when the censoring parameters @xmath40 s are not large , whereas the compound poisson process will be needed when the shrinkage transformation only keeps very few non - zero values , e.g. , the order - thresholding transformation in ( [ order ] ) with not so large @xmath36 value .",
    "the rigorous theoretical proofs are beyond the scope of this article and will be investigated elsewhere .",
    "below we will use chebyshev s inequality and clt to provide two approximations of the global threshold @xmath24 in terms of @xmath41    to do so , let us assume that under the pre - change hypothesis @xmath42 the local detection statistics @xmath8 s and their shrinkage transformations converge very fast to stationary distributions as the time step @xmath3 goes to @xmath39 more specifically , we assume that for each @xmath43 the @xmath44 s converge to their limit @xmath45 which is stochastically larger than @xmath44 s and has a well - defined log - moment generating function @xmath46 for all @xmath47 by the definition of @xmath31 in ( [ shrinkage2 ] ) and by applying chebyshev s inequality to both @xmath48 and @xmath49 , for any @xmath50 @xmath51 \\\\ & = & x \\big [ 1 -   { { \\bf p}}^{(\\infty)}\\big ( \\sum_{k=1}^{k } h_{k}(w_{k , n } ) \\ge a \\mbox { for some $ 1 \\le n \\le x$}\\big ) \\big ] \\\\",

    "for censoring sensor networks in figure [ fig : mei1 ] , practitioners often prefer the local sensors to send summary messages @xmath77 s to the fusion center only when necessary , so as to prolong the reliability and lifetime of the network system .",
    "the question then becomes when and how to send summary messages so that the fusion center can still monitor the network system effectively . in the quickest change detection problem in censoring sensor networks ,",
    "let @xmath1 denote the observations at the @xmath9-th sensor at time step @xmath78 in this section , we focus on nonhomogeneous sensors , but make a restrictive assumption that the pre - change and post - change distributions of the @xmath1 s are given . in the next section",
    ", we will investigate the case of homogeneous sensors when the post - change distributions are unknown .",
    "specifically , in this section we follow the literature to assume that for each @xmath79 the density function of the observations at the @xmath9-th data stream is @xmath80 before the change , and is @xmath81 after the change if the @xmath9-th data stream is affected , where the @xmath80 s and @xmath81 s are completely specified densities with respect to a suitable measure @xmath82 , see , for example , tartakovsky and veeravalli @xcite . for each @xmath83",

    "the first one is the local detection statistic @xmath8 s , which is simple in this context since the pre - change and post - change distributions , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , are known at each local sensor .",
    "for instance , the @xmath8 s can be chosen as the well - known local cusum statistics ( page @xcite ) that are defined recursively by @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 as shown in lorden @xcite and moustakides @xcite , the local cusum statistics @xmath8 s in ( [ eq3n01 ] ) yield the optimal local procedure to detect the local change under some suitable criteria .    next , we need to specify concrete shrinkage transformation @xmath30 s in ( [ shrinkage ] ) for censoring sensor networks . to prolong the reliability and lifetime of the network system ,",
    "it is natural for the local sensors to transmit only those local cusum statistics @xmath8 s that are large .",
    "specifically , at time @xmath76 the sensor message from the sensor to the fusion center is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the local censoring parameter at the @xmath9-th sensor ( or data stream ) .",
    "in practice , the message  null \" could be represented by the situation when the sensor does not send any message to the fusion center , e.g. , the sensor is silent .    after receiving the local sensor messages from the sensors , the fusion center then combines these local sensor messages @xmath77 s in ( [ hardthreshold ] ) suitably together to make a global decision .",
    "there are many approaches to do so , and below we illustrate three of them .",
    "the first two schemes are based on the summation of all sensor messages @xmath77 s , depending on how to interpret the  null \" values .",
    "if we treat the  null \" values as lower limit @xmath93 then the fusion center raises a global alarm at time @xmath94 below this scheme will be referred as the hard - thresholding scheme , since it is a special case of the global statistic in ( [ shrinkage ] ) when the shrinkage functions @xmath30 s are the hard - thresholding transformation in ( [ hard ] ) .    meanwhile ,",
    "if we treat the  null \" values as the upper limit @xmath95 s , then the fusion center will compute the global monitoring statistic @xmath96 which is closely related to the soft - thresholding transformation in ( [ soft ] ) .",
    "hence , we can define the soft - thresholding scheme that raises an alarm at time @xmath97 here we keep the threshold of @xmath98 as @xmath24 instead of @xmath99 so that @xmath98 is the special case of our proposed sum - shrinkage scheme @xmath31 in ( [ shrinkage2 ] ) with the soft - thresholding transformation in ( [ soft ] ) .",
    "the third approach occurs when the fusion center has a prior knowledge that ( at most ) @xmath36 out of @xmath2 data streams will be affected by the occurring event .",
    "such a prior knowledge may be defined by the network fault - tolerant design to avoid risking failure . in this case",
    ", it is reasonable for the fusion center to order all sensor messages @xmath77 s as @xmath100 and raise an alarm if the sum of the @xmath36 largest @xmath77 s is too large .",
    "this is a combination of the hard - thresholding transformation in ( [ hard ] ) and the order - thresholding transformation in ( [ order ] ) , and it yields a global scheme that is defined by the stopping time @xmath101 for simplicity , the  null \" values of @xmath77 s in the scheme @xmath102 in ( [ rankcusum1 ] ) will be treated as the lower limit @xmath103 in our simulation below .    for the purpose of comparison",
    ", we also apply the order - thresholding transformation in ( [ order ] ) directly to the local cusum statistics @xmath8 s in ( [ eq3n01 ] ) themselves .",
    "specifically , we order the @xmath2 local cusum statistics @xmath104 from largest to smallest : @xmath105 then the order - thresholding scheme can be defined by the stopping time @xmath106 of course , @xmath107 is a special case of @xmath102 when the local censoring parameter @xmath108 since the local cusum statistics @xmath109 for all @xmath9 and all @xmath78    it is useful to mention that each of all four schemes in ( [ eq000012])-([rankcusum ] ) is based on our proposed shrinkage statistics in ( [ shrinkage ] ) , but each is actually a very large family of schemes that includes  max \" or  sum \" schemes or both as special cases . for instance , for the hard - thresholding scheme @xmath110 in ( [ eq000012 ] ) , it becomes the  sum \" scheme @xmath23 in ( [ eq3n03 ] ) if the censoring parameter @xmath111 for all @xmath43 but becomes the  max \" scheme @xmath112 in ( [ eq3n02 ] ) if @xmath113 for all @xmath114 similarly , the order - thresholding scheme @xmath107 in ( [ rankcusum ] ) becomes the  max \" scheme when the order parameter @xmath115 and becomes the  sum \" scheme when @xmath116 as for the soft - thresholding scheme @xmath98 in ( [ eq000012b ] ) , it becomes the  sum \" scheme if @xmath111 for all @xmath43 and based on our numerical experience , its properties are similar to those of the  max \" scheme when @xmath95 s are very large .    besides the local cusum statistics ,",
    "another popular local detection statistic is the local shiryaev - roberts statistic ( shiryaev @xcite , roberts @xcite ) which can be defined in the log - likelihood ratio scale by @xmath117 for @xmath88 and @xmath118 it is well - known that the local shiryaev - roberts statistics @xmath119 in ( [ eqn : sr ] ) yield an efficient local detection procedure whose performance is similar to that of local cusum statistics in ( [ eq3n01 ] ) when detecting a local change in distribution from @xmath120 to @xmath121 see pollak @xcite . in our numerical analysis below , the local detection statistics @xmath8 s can also be defined as @xmath119 s in ( [ eqn : sr ] ) , the local shiryaev - roberts statistics in logarithm scale , or better yet , its positive part @xmath122 .",
    "our numerical simulation experiences suggest that the performances of global monitoring schemes based upon local shiryaev - roberts statistics are similar to those based upon local cusum statistics in ( [ eq3n01 ] ) when monitoring @xmath2 data streams .",
    "unfortunately it is still an open question to investigate the theoretical properties of shiryaev - roberts - type schemes in the context of @xmath2 data streams , and thus we will focus on the local cusum statistics @xmath123 s in ( [ eq3n01 ] ) as the local detection statistics below .      so far we simply follow our intuition without discussing how to choose the local censoring parameters @xmath95 s in ( [ hardthreshold ] ) for censoring sensor networks .",
    "intuitively , the @xmath95 s should be the same when the sensors are homogeneous , but they probably should be different when the sensors are nonhomogeneous .",
    "it turns out that a  good \" choice is @xmath124 for @xmath125 for some common constant @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 is the kl information number defined in ( [ eq000001 ] ) .",
    "theoretical justification of our choice of @xmath95 in ( [ eq000010])-([eq000011 ] ) will be postponed to subsection 3.4 .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath129 in ( [ eq000011 ] ) can be thought of as the weight of the @xmath9-th data stream in the overall final decision , and the choice of @xmath130 in ( [ eq000010 ] ) allows those affected local sensors to send local messages @xmath77 s with large values to the fusion center at roughly the same time , thereby leading the quick detection of occurring event .    it remains to choose the common constant @xmath131 in ( [ eq000010 ] ) .",
    "this may be determined by a non - statistical constraint in censoring sensor networks that the average fraction of transmitting sensors at any time step is restricted to be at most @xmath132 when no change occurs . in this case , when no event occurs , the average fraction of transmitting sensors at any time step @xmath3 is @xmath133 where @xmath134 and the second - to - last inequality follows from the well - known properties of the local cusum statistics that @xmath135 for all @xmath136 see , for example , appendix 2 on page 245 of siegmund @xcite .",
    "thus a choice of @xmath137 will guarantee that on average , at most @xmath138 of @xmath2 sensors will transmit messages at any given time when no event occurs .",
    "a special case occurs when all @xmath2 sensors are homogeneous in the sense that the kl information numbers @xmath128 s in ( [ eq000001 ] ) are the same for all @xmath114 then we have @xmath139 and our proposed choice of the local censoring parameter is given by @xmath140 for all @xmath11 it is interesting to see that as the number @xmath2 of homogeneous sensors increases , the weight @xmath129 of each local sensor in the overall final decision is decreasing , but the common constant @xmath40 is increasing .",
    "thus the choice of the local censoring parameter @xmath95 s in ( [ eqnlocal ] ) remains as a constant , and this seems attractive to practitioners in censoring sensor networks .",
    "it is important to emphasize for each of our proposed schemes @xmath25 in ( [ eq000012])-([rankcusum ] ) , the stopping time @xmath25 is increasing as a function of the censoring parameters @xmath95 s when the global threshold value @xmath24 is _",

    "however , the situation becomes completely different when @xmath25 is required to satisfy the false alarm constraint ( [ eq000002 ] ) .",

    "our numerical simulation experience suggests that as a continuous function , the soft - thresholding transformation often yields smaller detection delays than the hard - thresholding transformation , and is computationally more efficient than the order - thresholding transformation .    to be more specific , in this section we will consider the soft - thresholding scheme @xmath380 where , for simplicity , all transformations @xmath30 s are chosen to the same soft - thresholding transformation @xmath381 for some constant @xmath382 our focus is how we can construct the local detection statistics @xmath8 s suitably .",

    "subsection 4.1 reviews the recursive register approach of lorden and pollak @xcite for monitoring a single data stream , which is adapted to monitoring positive and negative mean shifts in subsection 4.2 . subsection 4.3 provides a bayesian interpretation of the soft - thresholding scheme as well as an efficient numerical algorithm of our proposed sum - shrinkage scheme that only uses fixed @xmath383 registers to store all past information and involves @xmath5 computations at each given time step @xmath78 numerical simulation results are summarized in subsection 4.4 .      to abuse notation , in this subsection",
    "we suppress the subscript @xmath9 of the @xmath9-th data stream , and consider the local monitoring problem with respect to the one - dimensional data stream @xmath384 whose distribution may change from @xmath0 to @xmath385 with unknown post - change mean @xmath82 at some unknown time @xmath295 lorden and pollak @xcite focuses on the case when the unknown post - change mean @xmath386 and makes a technical assumption that @xmath387 where @xmath388 is the smallest mean shift that is meaningful in practice , e.g. @xmath389    a high - level description of the recursive register approach of lorden and pollak @xcite is as follows .",
    "recall that the cusum statistics are defined in ( [ eq3n01 ] ) , and for one - dimensional normal distributed data , the cusum statistics have a simpler recursive form @xmath390 and @xmath391 when @xmath82 is unknown , we can continue to use this recursive formula to define a detection statistic if we replace the true unknown @xmath82 by its estimate from the past observed data . a key observation in lorden and",
    "pollak @xcite is that at each given time step @xmath76 the cusum - type detection statistics can produce a candidate post - change time @xmath392 and thus the observations @xmath393 can be used to estimated the post - change mean @xmath82 in ( [ eqncusum ] ) .",
    "specifically , at any given time step @xmath76 define @xmath394 as the largest @xmath395 such that @xmath396 and denote by @xmath397 and @xmath398 the total number and the summation of observations @xmath399 s between the candidate post - change time @xmath394 and time step @xmath400 that is , @xmath401 by the method of moments estimator or maximum likelihood estimator method , the post - change mean @xmath82 can be estimated by @xmath402 at time step @xmath78 if we treat the pre - specified nonnegative constants @xmath403 and @xmath404 as a prior , then a bayes - type estimate of @xmath82 is @xmath405 which includes @xmath406 as a special case when @xmath407 after taking into account that @xmath408 is the smallest post - change mean we are interested in , one can estimate @xmath82 at time step @xmath3 by @xmath409    from the algorithm viewpoint , the recursive register approach of lorden and pollak @xcite can be recursively implemented as follows .",
    "let @xmath410 and @xmath411 for all @xmath412 @xmath413 where @xmath414 is defined in ( [ eqn : muhat ] ) and @xmath415 in other words , the local detection statistics @xmath416 s can be computed recursively as the part of three - dimensional vectors @xmath417 or four - dimensional vectors @xmath418 it is important to note that @xmath419 only uses the observations up to time @xmath420 for the purpose of estimating the post - change mean @xmath421 so that the data @xmath422 is reserved for the local detection statistics @xmath416 for the purpose of detecting changes .",
    "it was shown that the detection scheme based on the detection statistic @xmath416 in ( [ eq : w_n ] ) is asymptotically optimal whenever the true post - change mean @xmath423 see theorems 3.1 - 3.3 of lorden and pollak @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in detecting both positive and negative local mean shifts for affected data streams , we propose to extend the detection statistic @xmath416 in ( [ eq : w_n ] ) of lorden and pollak @xcite from one - sided to two - sided .",
    "observe that detecting negative local mean shift of @xmath1 s is equivalent to detecting positive local mean shift of @xmath424 s , we propose the following two - sided local detection statistic for each local data stream at time @xmath425 @xmath426 where @xmath427 and @xmath428 are the local detection statistics of lorden and pollak @xcite for detecting positive and negative mean shifts , respectively .",

    "also the two - sided local detection statistic @xmath8 in ( [ eq : w_n2 ] ) is always nonnegative for any @xmath9 at any time step @xmath3 , and it will become large when there is a local mean shift no matter whether such mean shift is positive or negative .      with the local detection statistics @xmath8 s in ( [ eq : w_n2 ] ) , the soft - thresholding scheme in ( [ eqn : soft ] ) can be used to monitor @xmath2 data streams with possible local positive or negative mean shifts .",
    "it is natural to ask why the the soft - thresholding scheme in ( [ eqn : soft ] ) works ? besides the motivation in the previous section , below we also provide a semi - bayesian interpretation .    at a given time @xmath76",
    "let @xmath437 be the indicator whether the distribution of the @xmath9-th local data stream changes for @xmath11 assume that each local data stream has a prior probability @xmath438 getting affected by the event , and assume that @xmath439 are iid with probability mass function @xmath440 treat @xmath437 s as the hidden states , and recall that @xmath8 represents the evidence of possible change ( in logarithm scale ) and is applicable only when @xmath441 ( since @xmath442 implies that there is no change at the @xmath9-th data stream ) .",
    "then when testing @xmath443 ( no change ) , the log - likelihood ratio ( llr ) statistic of the hidden state @xmath437 s and the observed data @xmath1 s is @xmath444 since the @xmath437 s are unobservable , it is natural to maximize @xmath445 over @xmath446 hence , the maximum likelihood estimator of the @xmath437 s is that @xmath447 and the generalized log - likelihood ratio becomes @xmath448 which is exactly the form of the soft - thresholding scheme @xmath98 in ( [ eqn : soft ] ) with @xmath449    the above discussion indicates that if we have a prior knowledge that a fraction of @xmath438 sensors will be affected by the event , the censoring parameter @xmath450 can be chosen as @xmath451 meanwhile , as in the previous section , if we want @xmath452 proportion of data streams to send information to the fusion center when no change occurs , one rule of thumb is to choose @xmath453 it is interesting to see that these two values of @xmath450 are very close when @xmath454 is small . in practice ,",
    "the true value of @xmath438 is often unknown , but one may have a preferred @xmath452 value .",
    "hence , in our simulations below we will choose the censoring parameter @xmath455    note that the proposed soft - thresholding scheme @xmath98 in ( [ eqn : soft ] ) can be easily implemented in the censoring sensor network context by parallel computing the @xmath2 local detection statistics @xmath8 s recursively through ( [ eq : w_n2])-([eq : stn2 ] ) at the local sensor levels . to be more specific",
    ", we can use the following @xmath383 registers to adaptively store all past information at each time step after observing new data : @xmath456 for @xmath431 and @xmath457 at any given time step @xmath76 we can first update the @xmath458 registers in @xmath459 using the past data and compute the @xmath460 estimates @xmath461 of the post - change means @xmath372 s .",
    "then after we observe new observations , @xmath462 we only need to update the @xmath460 registers @xmath463 s and compute the values of @xmath2 local detection statistics @xmath464 s , which allows us to easily compute the global monitoring statistic @xmath465 including the @xmath466 intermediate variables @xmath467 and the global monitoring statistic @xmath468 the proposed scheme only needs @xmath469 registers to adaptively store all relevant information and involves @xmath5 computations at any given time step @xmath78 moreover , our proposed scheme can be implemented in the context of censoring sensor networks in the previous section where most computations are done at the remote sensors and the communication cost and the computational burden at the fusion center are marginal .",

    "for the purpose of comparison , we follow xie and siegmund @xcite to assume that there are @xmath156 independent normal data streams . for each @xmath486 the data @xmath1 s of the @xmath9-th data stream are iid @xmath0 before the change , but are iid @xmath487 after the @xmath9-th data stream is affected by the occurring event .    in our simulations ,",
    "we consider six schemes : two of them are the xie and siegmund schemes @xmath488 in ( [ eqn_xs ] ) with @xmath489 and @xmath490 and the remaining four schemes are our proposed soft - thresholding schemes @xmath98 in ( [ eqn : soft ] ) with four different thresholding parameters : @xmath491 as in the previous section , the three non - zero @xmath450 values imply that on average at most @xmath492 and @xmath155 out of @xmath150 local data streams produce significant @xmath8 s values to the global monitoring statistic @xmath32 when there are no changes .",
    "when computing the local detection statistics @xmath8 s in ( [ eq : w_n2 ] ) , we set @xmath493 and @xmath494 as in lorden and pollak @xcite .    for each of these six schemes @xmath247 we first numerically search the threshold @xmath24 to satisfy the global false alarm constraint @xmath26 in ( [ eq000002 ] ) .",

    "next , for the detection delays of @xmath247 we consider various post - change hypotheses , and for each post - change hypothesis , we simulate the @xmath496 when the event occurs at time @xmath497 and use this as an estimate of the detection delay @xmath498 all simulated values are based on @xmath499 monte carlo runs .    .a comparison of detection delays when the change is instantaneous and the post - change mean @xmath500 if affected .",

    "siegmund scheme @xmath488 in ( [ eqn_xs ] ) , our simulated detection delay results are slightly different from their reported results in their paper , possibly because our simulation is based on @xmath499 runs instead of @xmath501 runs in their paper .",
    "note that the xie and siegmund schemes @xmath488 in ( [ eqn_xs ] ) involve expensive computations , and require the fusion center to have full access to all raw data .",
    "thus it is not surprising that their schemes have smaller detection delays than our proposed soft - thresholding schemes .",
    "however , we want to emphasize that the xie and siegmund schemes are not scalable and can not be implemented in the context of distributed monitoring in censoring sensor networks . meanwhile , our proposed schemes are suitable to the censoring sensor network contexts , as they can be easily implemented by parallel computing in a recursive manner at the local sensors level and the computational costs between the local sensors and the fusion center will be marginal .",
    "a more reasonable comparison is to compare the results in table [ table3 ] with those in table [ table01 ] which were conducted under the assumption that the post - change mean of each affected local data stream is @xmath502 when at least @xmath255 local data streams are affected , the detection delays of @xmath503 in table [ table3 ] are only @xmath504 larger than those of @xmath505 in table [ table01 ]",
    ". since the schemes in table [ table3 ] are able to detect both positive or negative mean shifts , one may be willing to pay the price of slightly larger detection delays at the given post - change mean @xmath506 so as to effectively detect other local mean shifts , especially the negative shifts .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to see from table [ table3 ] that as the false alarm constraint @xmath26 increases from @xmath507 to @xmath508 the global threshold @xmath24 of our proposed soft - thresholding schemes @xmath509 increases moderately for any given censoring parameters @xmath510 but the detection delays of our proposed soft - thresholding schemes increase only marginally when at least @xmath255 data streams are affected .",
    "all simulations were done on a windows 8 laptop with intel i7 - 4700mq cpu 2.40ghz using matlab r2013b . for each of these schemes @xmath25 ( i.e. , each row of table [ table3 ] ) , the most time consuming",
    "part was to search for the global threshold @xmath24 so that @xmath511 when @xmath260 it took about @xmath158 minutes to find such @xmath24 from _ a range of values _ for our proposed schemes based on @xmath499 monte carlo runs ( the time is shorter if our initial guess range of @xmath24 is closer ) .",
    "meanwhile , for the xie and siegmund scheme , for a _ given _ global threshold @xmath24 around @xmath512 which was provided in their paper , it took about one and a half hour on average to finish one monte carlo simulation run in our laptop . if we did not know @xmath513 and wanted to try @xmath149 different values of @xmath24 s by bisection method based on @xmath499 monte carlo runs for each @xmath24 , it would have taken about @xmath514 computer hours for the case of @xmath515 when @xmath516 it took us about one hour to find the global threshold @xmath24 for our proposed schemes , but we are unable to numerically implement the xie and siegmund schemes since their computational time will be in days for each monte carlo run .",
    "once the global threshold @xmath24 is found , it is straightforward to simulate the detection delays in table [ table3 ] . when @xmath260 our proposed schemes are at least @xmath149 times faster than the xie and siegmund schemes .",
    "for instance , when exactly one data stream is affected , it took @xmath517 seconds to simulate the detection delay of our proposed schemes , whereas it took @xmath518 seconds to simulate those of the xie and siegmund schemes . hence , as compared to the xie and siegmund schemes , the computational advantage of our proposed schemes is evident .",
    "this section is devoted to prove theorems [ theorem1 ] and [ theorem2 ] .",
    "* proof of theorem [ theorem1 ] . *",
    "intuitively , only those affected sensors provide information to detect the occurring events , and the quickest possible way to detect the occurring event is when the event affects the sensors instantaneously .",
    "more rigorously , if we define @xmath519 then for any given scheme @xmath520 @xmath521 where the infumum is taken over all possible schemes @xmath522 satisfying the false alarm constraint @xmath26 in ( [ eq000002 ] ) .",
    "an alternative and possible better viewpoint is based on a time - shifting argument in which one imagines that at time @xmath3 one observes the observations @xmath523 ( instead of @xmath1 ) when @xmath276 is finite , and then applies @xmath304 to the new aligned observations .    without loss of generality ,",
    "assume that the first @xmath524 data streams are affected abruptly and simultaneously by the event at unknown time @xmath7 and other data streams are unaffected .",
    "that is , @xmath524 out of @xmath2 data streams are affected by the event , and @xmath525 for @xmath526 and @xmath19 for @xmath527 by ( [ jinfo ] ) , we have @xmath528 in this case , we face the sequential change detection problem when the distribution of @xmath529 changes from @xmath530 to @xmath531 it is well - known ( lorden @xcite ) that @xmath532 subject to the false alarm constraint @xmath26 in ( [ eq000002 ] ) as @xmath533 combining the above results yields relation ( [ eqlowerbound ] ) , completing the proof of theorem [ theorem1 ] .       to prove ( [ eq000006 ] ) , note that @xmath317 in ( [ eq000012 ] ) is increasing as a function of @xmath126 and when @xmath534 @xmath535 reduces to the  sum \" scheme @xmath23 in ( [ eq3n03 ] ) .",
    "hence , for any @xmath126 @xmath536 and of course , @xmath537 by theorem 1 of mei @xcite , the  sum \" scheme @xmath23 satisfies relation ( [ eq000006 ] ) , and so are the hard - thresholding schemes @xmath317 for all @xmath319    to prove relation ( [ eq0011 ] ) , it is clear that the worst - case detection delay of @xmath317 occurs at the change - point @xmath497 and thus it suffices to show that @xmath538 satisfies ( [ eq0011 ] ) . without loss of generality , we assume that only the first @xmath524 data steams are affected and no other data streams are affected . to simplify our notation below , denote @xmath539 it suffices to show that @xmath540 for all @xmath541 when @xmath315 and @xmath542 go to @xmath39    the essential idea in the proof of ( [ eq0018 ] ) is to compare @xmath317 with new stopping times that are only based on those affected @xmath524 data streams . define a stopping time that is in the form of the one - sided sequential probability ratio test ( sprt ) : @xmath543 where the weights @xmath129 s are defined in ( [ eq000011 ] ) , and let @xmath544 be the new stopping time that applies @xmath545 to the new observations after time @xmath546    now whenever @xmath544 stops at time @xmath547 we know that @xmath545 stops after applying it to @xmath548 observations @xmath549 for each @xmath114 by the definition of the local cusum statistics in ( [ eq3n01 ] ) , we have @xmath550 for all @xmath551 hence , @xmath552 where the last relation is from the definition of @xmath553 this implies that the scheme @xmath317 must stop at time @xmath547 and possibly earlier .",
    "thus @xmath554 where @xmath555 is the binary version of @xmath276 s defined in ( [ newdelta ] ) . to simplify the notation ,",
    "denote by @xmath556 the expectation when the change occurs at time @xmath250 and the event affects the first @xmath524 data streams immediately but does not affect the other remaining @xmath557 data streams .",
    "so it suffices to show that the stopping time @xmath545 in ( [ newonesprt ] ) satisfies @xmath558    to prove ( [ eqnn0020 ] ) , for @xmath559 let @xmath560 in the definition of @xmath561 the assumption of @xmath541 is used to make sure that the threshold @xmath562 goes to @xmath302 as @xmath313 since @xmath563 and @xmath564 is assumed to go to @xmath39 combining these definitions with those of @xmath545 in ( [ newonesprt ] ) yields that @xmath565 hence , relation ( [ eqnn0020 ] ) holds if we can establish the following three relations : @xmath566 relation ( [ eqqn1 ] ) is well - known in renewal theory , e.g. , theorem d in kiefer and sacks @xcite , since @xmath567 has positive mean and finite variance under @xmath556 by our assumptions in ( [ eq000001 ] ) and ( [ eq000001b ] ) .    for relation ( [ eqqn2 ] ) , by the definition of @xmath129 in ( [ eq000011 ] ) , we have @xmath568 since @xmath569 is the stopping time when a random walk exceed the bound @xmath570 the application of standard renewal theory yields that @xmath571 as the threshold @xmath572 goes to @xmath306 see , for example , siegmund ( * ? ? ?",
    "thus relation ( [ eqqn2 ] ) holds .",
    "the proof of relation ( [ eqqn3 ] ) is a little more complicated , but it can be done along the same line as that in mei @xcite .",
    "the key fact is that the choice of @xmath311 s in ( [ eq000010])-([eq000011 ] ) makes sure that the stopping times @xmath573 s have roughly the same mean under @xmath574 specifically , by renewal theory and the assumptions of @xmath575 in ( [ eq000001 ] ) and ( [ eq000001b ] ) , under @xmath576 @xmath577 and @xmath578 as @xmath579 see siegmund @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath580 as @xmath581 hence , for each @xmath486 there exist two constants @xmath582 and @xmath583 so that for all @xmath126 @xmath584 therefore , @xmath585 where the constant @xmath586 does not depend on @xmath587 this proves relation ( [ eqqn3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , relations ( [ eqqn1])-([eqqn3 ] ) hold , and thus relation ( [ eq0011 ] ) holds for the hard - thresholding scheme @xmath317 in ( [ eq000012 ] ) . the proof for the soft - thresholding scheme @xmath324 in ( [ eq000012b ] ) is identical and thus omitted",
    "now let us provide a sketch of the proof for part ( iii ) of theorem [ theorem2 ] on the order - thresholding scheme @xmath143 in ( [ rankcusum ] ) and the combined thresholding scheme @xmath327 in ( [ rankcusum1 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath143 is a special case of @xmath327 with @xmath534 it suffices to prove the theorem for @xmath327 in ( [ rankcusum1 ] ) with @xmath319 clearly relation ( [ eq000006 ] ) also holds for @xmath327 for any @xmath126 because the  sum \" scheme @xmath23 again provides the lower bound for @xmath588 it remains to show that relation ( [ eq0011 ] ) holds for @xmath327 with @xmath269 in the scenario when the occurring event affects at most @xmath36 data streams , i.e. , when @xmath589 without loss of generality , assume that the affected data streams are just the first @xmath524 data streams with @xmath590 recall that @xmath591 and we order the @xmath77 s as @xmath100 and @xmath327 stops if @xmath592 note that if @xmath593 @xmath594 since @xmath595 thus , if at some time @xmath548 we have @xmath596 and @xmath597 for @xmath598 ( i.e. , for the first @xmath524 data streams ) , then @xmath327 will also stop at time @xmath548 and possibly earlier .",
    "hence , whenever @xmath599 the stopping time @xmath545 in ( [ newonesprt ] ) also provides an upper bound on the detection delay of @xmath588 thus the proposed combined thresholding scheme @xmath327 in ( [ rankcusum1 ] ) satisfies relation ( [ eq0011 ] ) whenever the occurring event affects at most @xmath36 data streams .",
