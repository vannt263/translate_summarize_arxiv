    "whereas anderson localization phenomena @xcite are rather well understood for a single particle ( see the reviews @xcite ) , the case of interacting particles in a random potential has remained much more challenging ( see the review @xcite and more recent works @xcite ) . since the case of a finite density of particles can be studied numerically only for small system sizes , it is natural to consider first the simpler case of only two interacting particles ( t.i.p . ) in a random potential . in dimension @xmath13 , where the one - particle model is always in the localized phase with some localization length @xmath14 , it has been found that the t.i.p .",
    "is also always localized , but with a localization length @xmath15 that may become much larger than @xmath14 @xcite . in dimension @xmath16 , where the one - particle model is again always in the localized phase , the possibility of a delocalization transition has been studied for short - range interaction @xcite and for coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we are interested in the two - particle transport properties at the anderson localization transition of the one - particle problem , where the one - particle eigenstates are multifractal @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of previous studies on this question ( see however @xcite concerning the quasi - periodic aubry - andr transition ) .",
    "since for the tight - binding model in dimension @xmath17 where there exists an anderson transition , the two - particle model can not be studied numerically for large enough system sizes and large enough statistics on the disordered samples to obtain accurate results , we have chosen to focus here on the power - law random banded matrices ( prbm ) model , and to study numerically the statistical properties of the two - particle transmission @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we recall the power - law random banded matrices ( prbm ) model and introduce the observables that characterize transport properties for the two - particle model . in section [ numet2 ] , we describe our numerical results concerning the statistical properties of the transmission @xmath4 for two distinguishable particles , two bosons and two fermions .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ conclusion ] . in appendix",

    "beside the usual short - range anderson tight - binding model in finite dimension @xmath19 , other models displaying anderson localization have been studied , in particular the power - law random banded matrix ( prbm ) model , which can be viewed as a one - dimensional model with long - ranged random hopping decaying as a power - law @xmath20 of the distance @xmath21 with exponent @xmath22 and parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the anderson transition at @xmath3 between localized ( @xmath24 ) and extended ( @xmath25 ) states has been characterized in @xcite via a mapping onto a non - linear sigma - model .",

    "the value of the exponent @xmath22 determines the localization properties @xcite : for @xmath24 states are localized with integrable power - law tails , whereas for @xmath25 states are delocalized . at criticality @xmath3 , states become multifractal @xcite and exponents depend continuously of the parameter @xmath23 , which plays a role analog to the dimension @xmath19 in short - range anderson transitions @xcite : the limit @xmath36 corresponds to weak multifractality ( analogous to the case @xmath37 ) and can be studied via the mapping onto a non - linear sigma - model @xcite , whereas the case @xmath38 corresponds to strong multifractality ( analogous to the case of high dimension @xmath19 ) and can be studied via levitov renormalization @xcite .",
