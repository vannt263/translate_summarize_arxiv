    "special care was taken to find a nucleation site where a consistent and circular bubble was nucleated with both polarities during the nucleation pulse .",
    "furthermore , the area around the nucleation site , i.e. the area where the expanding bubble travels through , was checked for strong pinning sites which could possibly lead to non - continuous extracted dw velocities . after mounting every sample the in - plane field coil angle relative to the sample plane",
    "was carefully tuned to minimize the leak into the perpendicular field direction .    by fitting and averaging the expansion of the bubble versus the total applied @xmath21 pulse time the dw velocity @xmath30 versus @xmath31 is extracted , as shown in fig .",

    "speculative , we expect the change in @xmath37 with @xmath4 to be small as we observe identical structural properties for all @xmath4 from the hrtem study and the strong increase in @xmath35 could be dominated by @xmath38 , this however , remains an open issue .",

    "[ bub](d ) we have plotted @xmath36 versus @xmath13 and the dashed red line shows @xmath44 . the good agreement leads us to conclude that no large changes in the shape of the dw pinning landscape is expected , as it only scales with @xmath13 . summarizing",

    "this leads to the situation as shown in the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ bub](e ) where a magnetic bubble with its magnetization along @xmath49 ( grey area ) is shown .",
    "since there is no preferred chirality for bloch dws the dw magnetization can rotate either clock or anti - clockwise going through the dw from the inside to the outside of the bubble as indicated by the double arrows . in a simple description of dmi at dws @xcite ,",
    "the dmi manifests itself as a built - in magnetic field @xmath50 pointing in - plane perpendicular to the dw , where @xmath51 is the strength of the dmi interaction , and @xmath52 the dw width . hence , for @xmath53 nel type dws are preferred as shown in the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ bub](e ) and depending on the sign of @xmath51 a clock ( @xmath54 ) , or anti - clockwise ( @xmath55 ) dw chirality is introduced as indicated by the white and purple arrows , respectively . for @xmath56",
    "the dw assumes a mixed bloch - nel character . by now applying a strong in - plane field along the x - axis ( @xmath26 )",
    "the dws magnetization reorients itself along @xmath26 due to the zeeman energy .",

    "[ bub](e ) , where we assume @xmath53 .",
    "the dw segments that are parallel to @xmath26 ( top and bottom of bubble , orange arrows ) become bloch type dws with an increase in dw energy density due the zeeman energy .",
    "the dw segments that are perpendicular ( left and right of bubble ) remain of the nel type .",
    "the nel dw which has its direction reversed ( and thus its chirality ) however , undergoes an increase in dw energy density .",
    "the same happens when @xmath54 ( bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ bub](e ) ) , albeit here the left and right dw behavior are reversed .",
    "an in - plane magnetic field breaks the symmetry of the dw energy profile along the in - plane field direction .",
    "this is experimentally shown in fig . [ bub](f ) where the bubble expansion for the @xmath4 = 1.40 pa sample is shown with a @xmath26 field applied .",
    "a strongly asymmetric expansion is observed where the dw moving in the direction of the applied @xmath26 field moves much faster as the dw moving against the in - plane field .",
    "the inset shows the expansion in the same sample but with inverted @xmath21 showing identical asymmetric expansion albeit mirrored in the y - axis .",
    "this observation was attributed to a built - in dmi field manifesting itself at the dws as explained before @xcite . by applying an in - plane field during the expansion the radial symmetry is broken as the dmi field would prefer nel type dws with a certain chirality which is broken by the in - plane field .    in fig .",
    "[ overview](a)-(f ) we plot the obtained dw velocities @xmath30 as a function of @xmath26 along the extremes of the bubble along the x and y - axis , i.e. parallel and perpendicular to the applied @xmath57 field for all @xmath4 . note the different @xmath30 scales used ; the variation in @xmath30 increases with higher @xmath4 .",
    "we have averaged the left moving dw segment velocity with positive @xmath58 ( i.e. up - down dws when moving from inside the bubble to outside ) , which we label l+ , with the right moving dw velocity for @xmath59 ( r- ) ( i.e. down - up dws when moving from inside the bubble to outside ) , as these have to be identical by symmetry ( see fig.[bub](f ) ) .",
    "the same has been done for the up ( u ) and down ( d ) moving dw segments .",
    "this allows us to compensate for small misalignments of the , relative to @xmath21 , large @xmath26 field .",
    "despite this compensation small residual asymmetries remain which we consider negligible ( compare the u+d- ( green ) and u - d+ ( blue ) profiles which need to be similar by symmetry ) .",
    "extracting the dw velocity profiles in this way allows us to disentangle the in - plane field effect on the dw velocity parallel ( l+r- and l - r+ ) and perpendicular ( u+d- and u - d+ ) to the applied @xmath26 field . the asymmetric bubble expansion is reflected in the difference between the l+r- and l - r+ velocity profiles at a certain @xmath26 .",
    "the u+d- and u - d+ profiles show a symmetric profile around @xmath26 = 0 mt .",
    "this observation corresponds with the aforementioned picture of a dmi field breaking the in - plane symmetry of the bubble expansion .    for @xmath4 = 0.29",
    "pa an increasingly ill - defined bubble expansion and extra domain nucleation is observed for high @xmath57 ( not shown ) .",
    "this makes it impossible to extract well defined dw velocities for @xmath60 200 mt as there is no bubble expansion but a dendrite like magnetization reversal . on close inspection of all the profiles",
    "three distinct dw velocity profile characteristics can be identified : ( 1 ) symmetric bubble expansion perpendicular to the in - plane field direction ( u+d- and u - d+ ) .",
    "( 2 ) asymmetric bubble expansion parallel to the in - plane field direction ( l+r- and l - r+ ) . ( 3 ) for @xmath4 = 0.29 pa the dw velocity shows a velocity drop symmetrically around @xmath26 = 0 ( most clearly seen for the u+d- and u - d+ profiles ) which decreases for the samples grown with higher @xmath4 .",
    "all the experimental l+r- ( black symbols ) profiles show a minimum at @xmath61 mt . in the interpretation of an effective dmi field",
    "this would indicate a constant positive built - in dmi field @xmath62 , i.e. a positive dmi energy @xmath54 would be found for all samples preferring a right handed dw chirality .",
    "furthermore , there would be no variation in the dmi as a function of @xmath4 which is puzzeling as the large variation in pma indicates a strong change in the interfacial quality and speculative also on the structural inversion asymmetry .",
    "the found @xmath54 is in - line with the report of je _ et al .",
    "_ but opposite to the report of hrabec _ et al .",
    "_ for pt / co / pt .",
    "moreover , the overall @xmath30 profile shape observed here is very different than described by the theory used in these reports .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the interpretation of the dmi leading to a simple in - plane field might be too simple for our samples .",
    "the out - of - plane driving field might have an effect on the profile shapes as this determines the strength of the dw motion . to examine the effect of the out - of - plane driving field we have plotted the @xmath63 l+r- profiles in fig .",
    "[ overview](g)-(l ) for different @xmath64 drive fields . for the lowest @xmath4",
    "we observe an overall changing shape of the velocity profile with increasing @xmath64 , for the higher @xmath4 the overall shape remains constant .",
    "this behavior further hints towards different mechanisms at work between the low and high @xmath4 samples which might be due to different dmi strengths . from this data",
    "we can extract the @xmath35 and @xmath36 parameters by fitting the velocity dependence on @xmath64 to the creep law ( eq . [ creep ] ) for every @xmath26 .",
    "this is shown in fig . [ overview](m)-(r ) where we plot @xmath65 and @xmath36 as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "the cyan line in the @xmath65 data is a fit to @xmath66 , which shows that a symmetric behavior for @xmath35 is observed relative to @xmath26 = 0 for all samples .",
    "furthermore , the variation in @xmath65 decreases strongly with increasing @xmath4 and remains more or less constant for the highest @xmath4 , which indicates a changing underlying dynamic response captured in @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36 data , however , shows an increasing asymmetry relative to @xmath26 = 0 with higher @xmath4 .",
    "the origin of this effect is not clear at the moment but the overal shape of the @xmath67 dependence is very different as expected from the theory described by je _ et al .",
    "_ , where a simple inverted parabolic behavior is expected with a maximum in @xmath36 at @xmath68 .      due to the discrepancy between the previously used theory and our experimental data we are unable to fully interpret the experimentally obtained velocity profiles",
    "naively interpreting the @xmath26 field at which a minimum in the dw velocity was observed , we find @xmath1 60@xmath1410 mt for all @xmath4 . if we interpret the interfacial @xmath2 as an effective field , i.e. originating from the difference of @xmath51 between the bottom pt / co and top co / pt interfaces , a correlation between the pma ( through @xmath4 ) and @xmath2 should have been evident .",
    "this is motivated by the known dependence of the pma on the interface quality . as this is not the case , i.e. a constant @xmath2",
    "is found for all @xmath4 whilst the pma varies over a factor three , indicates that this interpretation might be flawed .",
    "hence , this calls for further theoretical development of the underlying mechanisms and the simple model introduced by je _ et al .",
    "_ should be used with great care . specifically , we suggest that full micro - magnetics of the dws profiles and the strong pinning of the dws in the creep regime should be considered",
    ". the successful application of the theory in the reports by je _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite and hrabec _ _ et al.__@xcite might be due to different preparation procedures and ( lower ) @xmath26 field regimes studied . the co layer in our samples",
    "are rather thick ( 0.6 nm ) compared to the sample used by je _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite ( 0.3 nm ) which exhibit ultra low dw pinning , but are similar to the samples grown by hrabec _ _ et al.__@xcite .    very recently , asymmetric bubble expansion under in - plane fields was attributed to a completely different mechanism , viz .",
    "chiral - dependent damping @xcite again in similar systems of pt / co / pt .",
    "this would modulate the attempt frequency @xmath35 in the creep law ( eq . [ creep ] ) as a function of in - plane field and was explained as a dissipative ( field - like ) spin - orbit torque on the dw dynamics . as we have seen from the data in fig .",
    "[ overview](m)-(r ) we observe a symmetric behavior of @xmath35 relative to @xmath26 = 0 and can exclude this in our samples .",
    "in fact , the experimental finding that @xmath36 , and not @xmath69 , is asymmetric with respect to in - plane field suggests that the main asymmetry is in the dw energy rather than its dissipation .",
    "this conclusion holds provided the collective - pinning theory of the creep regime applies but is otherwise model - independent .",
    "one possibility for the influence of in - plane fields on the dw energy not considered before is the tilting of the domains by the in - plane field .",
    "this might be significant as the in - plane fields we apply are not necessarily small compared to the pma .",
    "the tilting of the domains by the in - plane field leads to an effective reduction of the driving force on the dw . in the simplest model for this reduction one replaces @xmath70 in the creep formula . using this model with @xmath13 as a fit parameter",
    ", we obtained fitted values for @xmath13 that have the same order of magnitude as the ones that we measured directly , but were nonetheless unable to accurately describe all our measurements .",
    "this suggests that a more accurate calculation of the dw energy , including the tilting of domains by the in - plane field , is needed , which is the subject of future theoretical work .    in summary",
    ", we studied the dw velocity profiles of expanding bubbles in differently prepared pt / co / pt samples under the application of in - plane fields .",
    "specifically , we varied the ar pressure during the deposition of the top pt layer leading to a factor three increase in pma between the lowest and highest pressure used .",
    "this indicates a large change in the structural quality between the samples .",
    "the velocity profiles of the expanding bubbels were successfully extracted .",
    "however , the results could not be described by a model that was used successfully before .",
    "we believe that the found results shed light on the understanding of the effective interfacial dmi in ultrathin films and will facilitate the quest to boost the dmi to stabilize chiral nel dws and create skyrmionic spin textures in thin film systems at room temperature .",

    "<S> the studied samples consist of sio2//ta(4)/pt@xmath8(4)/co(0.6)/pt@xmath9(4 ) ( thickness between parenthesis is given in nm ) where we have labeled the lower and upper pt layers as pt@xmath8 and pt@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> for ta , co and pt dc magnetron powers of 20 , 20 , 60 w were used , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the target - sample distance during sputtering for ta , co and pt was kept constant at 95 , 95 and 195 mm , respectively . the ar pressure during ta , </S>",
    "<S> co and pt@xmath8 layer deposition was kept constant at 1.4 , 1.0 and 0.29 pa , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure @xmath4 during the pt@xmath10 layers was varied between 0.29 and 2.8 pa . </S>",
    "<S> the pt growth rate was calibrated for every pressure to keep the top pt layer thickness constant at 4 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation magnetization was measured using a squid - vsm at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy was determined using angle dependent anomalous hall effect measurements at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a standard polar moke setup was used to obtain the hysteresis loops at a constant field sweep rate of 10 mt / s . </S>",
    "<S> the bubble expansion measurements were performed using wide field kerr microscopy in polar mode with a custom perpendicular pulse coil with a calibrated rise time of 70 @xmath11s to provide the perpendicular to the surface z - fields and a standard in - plane magnet for the in - plane x - field .      in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pma](a ) the measured saturation magnetization @xmath12 as a function @xmath4 is plotted for sio@xmath7 // </S>",
    "<S> ta(4 nm ) / pt(4 nm ) / co(0.6 nm ) / pt(4 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 is found to be close to the bulk value of co ( 1440 ka / m ) for all used @xmath4 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pma](b ) we plot the effective anisotropy field @xmath13 as a function of @xmath4 which shows a clear increase with @xmath4 up to a factor 3.1 between @xmath4 = 0.29 pa ( 760@xmath1480 mt ) and @xmath4 = 2.80 pa ( 2380@xmath14240 mt ) .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pma](c ) the hysteresis loops of the samples are presented showing square loops and increasing coercivity @xmath15 for higher @xmath4 , in agreement with observed behavior of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> these results show a clear trend of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( pma ) as captured in @xmath13 with increasing @xmath4 illustrating the sensitive nature of the pma to the growth conditions . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the structural quality of the co layer and interfaces with the pt are paramount and are determined by the kinetics during the growth of the top pt layer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar behavior has been seen before where the pma was fully dominated by the bottom pt / co interface @xcite . in another report </S>",
    "<S> the lack of pma from the top co / pt was attributed to a strongly intermixed top co / pt interface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , extending on this scenario a basic understanding can be found by examining the incoming kinetic energy of the pt atoms during growth , which roughly scales as the inverse of the pressure @xcite . to test this we plot in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pma](d ) @xmath13 as a function of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed for high pressure ( @xmath17 0.8 pa , @xmath3 1.19 pa@xmath18 ) a linear scaling with @xmath16 is found as indicated by the linear fit ( red dashed line ) . for lower @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> this trend breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this break down as the region where there is a strong intermixing between the pt and co atoms possibly creating an alloyed ptco layer , which are known to show high pma . in this case </S>",
    "<S> no well - defined pt / co and co / pt interfaces are formed , i.e. an interfacial structural inversion asymmetry would be poorly defined .    for higher pressures </S>",
    "<S> there is less intermixing and the interfaces get increasingly better defined . in this regime an effective dmi due to interfacial structural inversion asymmetry could be expected as long as the bottom and top interface are sufficiently different . </S>",
    "<S> we have labeled these regions the ` alloying ' and ` layered growth ' regime , respectively , in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> pma](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> other origins for the increasing pma with @xmath4 could be a changing density of the top pt film with @xmath4 , different crystal orientations , growth modes and/or grain sizes .    </S>",
    "<S> we have performed cross - sectional and plain view high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) studies on samples prepared on sin@xmath19 membranes and 50 nm thick lamella prepared using a focused ion beam but were unable to discern differences between the samples grown with low and high @xmath4 , both in crystal size as in orientation , viz . a strong @xmath3111@xmath17 texture for all samples was observed from electron diffraction patterns . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , using scanning tem - eds ( energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ) mapping we were unable to discern any differences in the intermixing between pt and co. this is due to the limit in resolution in the element maps due to the combination of the limited thickness of the ultrathin co film ( 0.6 nm ) and the surface roughness of the underlying pt layer ( due to its poly - crystalline nature , yielding a projected layer thickness of the co layer of @xmath201.5 nm . future atom - probe tomography measurements might shed light on the structural properties and provide further proof for the given hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that increasing the ar pressure during the growth of the top pt layer in pt / co / pt layers increases the effective pma by a factor 3.1 . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this change to an increasingly better defined layered growth of the pt / co / pt stack . </S>"
