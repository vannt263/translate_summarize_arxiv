    "non - equilibrium properties associated with the peak - effect ( pe ) in the c15-laves phase superconductor ceru@xmath0 have drawn some attention in recent years @xcite . it is observed that in certain field ( h )  temperature ( t ) regime ( which includes part of the pe regime ) , the field - cooled ( fc ) vortex state in ceru@xmath0 is more disordered than the vortex state obtained by isothermal variation of h after zero field cooling ( zfc ) .",
    "this fc vortex state in ceru@xmath0 is quite metastable in nature and susceptible to external fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the origin of pe and the associated non - equilibrium properties in ceru@xmath0 remain a matter of debate and various possibilities , starting from a underlying phase transition@xcite to dynamical crossover in flux - pinning properties @xcite , have been put forward .    in a recent communication @xcite",
    "we have drawn analogy between the zfc / fc response of the vortex state in and around the pe regime of ceru@xmath0 and the zfc / fc response of a random field ising systems ( rfim ) . through dc magnetization study in polycrystalline samples of ceru@xmath0",
    ", we had shown that the magnetization hysteresis in the fc state is distinctly more than the zfc state .",
    "this relatively large hysteresis in the fc state suggested that the fc state was more disordered .",
    "it should be recalled here that in the rfim systems while there exists a long range order in the zfc state , the same is absent in the fc state ; instead the fc state is frozen into a disordered domain structure , which is quite metastable in nature @xcite .",
    "the analogous behaviour ( if not the exact similarity ) of these two disparate class of systems has motivated us to investigate more in this direction . in this communication",
    "we shall present results of transport properties measured on good quality single crystals of ceru@xmath0 and v@xmath1si .",
    "while the present results on ceru@xmath0 will enhance our earlier picture @xcite obtained through dc magnetization study on polycrystalline samples , the additional results on the well known superconductor v@xmath1si will probably indicate more universality of the concerned features .",
    "we point out here that , although there exists report of pe in v@xmath1si @xcite , our results ( described below ) will show the existence of history effect and metastability associated with the pe of v@xmath1si .",
    "the single crystal samples of ceru@xmath0 and v@xmath1si used in this study are prepared by dr .",
    "a. d. huxley @xcite and dr .",
    "a. menovsky @xcite respectively , and the details of the sample preparation and characterization can be found in the references 13 and 14 .",
    "the residual resistivity ratio for the ceru@xmath0 and v@xmath1si samples are 15 and 47 respectively @xcite .",
    "the electrical resistance measurements are performed using the standard linear four probe method .",
    "a superconducting magnet and cryostat system ( oxford instruments , uk ) is used to obtain the required temperature ( t ) and magnetic field ( h ) environment . in the configuration of our measurement the current ( i@xmath2 ) is passed along the @xmath3 direction for the ceru@xmath0 sample and the @xmath4 direction for the v@xmath1si sample . in all the measurements",
    "the direction of i@xmath2 is kept perpendicular to h. the t@xmath5 for the ceru@xmath0 and v@xmath1si samples ( obtained from our zero field resistance measurements ) are 6.1 and 16.5k respectively . the magnetic field dependence of the resistance ( r(h ) )",
    "is measured ,    1 .   on zero field cooling",
    "( zfc ) the sample to various t ( @xmath6t@xmath5 ) followed by an isothermal variation of h. 2 .   on field cooling ( fc ) the sample across t@xmath5 in a fixed h to t ( @xmath6t@xmath5 ) .",
    "this is done for various h at each t.",
    "for a sample of type - ii superconductor with pinning , the critical current ( i@xmath5 ) decreases with the increase in h and goes to zero at the irreversibility field ( h@xmath7h@xmath8 ) .",
    "however , for superconductors showing pe , i@xmath5(h ) shows a peak or local maximum at an intermediate h value before finally going to zero at h@xmath9 . in an isothermal field variation",
    ", the consequence of pe will show up in r(h ) if the transport current ( i@xmath2 ) used in the measurement is larger than i@xmath5(h ) for an intermediate h regime but smaller than i@xmath5(h ) in the pe regime .",
    "in such a situation one would observe a flux flow resistivity at fields h where i@xmath10i@xmath5(h ) but the resistance will once again fall back to zero in the pe regime where i@xmath11 i@xmath5(h ) . adjusting our measuring current i@xmath2 appropriately , we show in fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) the r vs h plots with distinct signatures of pe for ceru@xmath0 and v@xmath1si .",
    "( although we have results obtained with various other measuring currents at different temperatures , for the sake of clarity and conciseness we shall use these two representative figures for further discussions in the present work ) .",
    "the intermediate flux - flow regime ( 0.8t@xmath12h@xmath121.24 t for ceru@xmath0 and 1.9t@xmath12h@xmath123.47 t for v@xmath1si ) and the pe regime ( 1.25t@xmath12h@xmath121.37 t for ceru@xmath0 and 3.48t@xmath12h@xmath123.62 t for v@xmath1si ) are very clear in these figures .",
    "as h approaches h@xmath9 , the flux - flow resistivity starts appearing again which ultimately leads to the normal state behaviour at h@xmath8 .",
    "the pe regime for the ceru@xmath0 sample identified in our present transport measurements agrees well with that obtained earlier with the magnetic measurements @xcite .",
    "a comparison with the sole magnetic measurement ( to our knowledge ) on v@xmath1si@xcite leads to a similar conclusion .",
    "we shall now focus on the field - history dependence of the resistance in both ceru@xmath0 and v@xmath1si .",
    "the value of i@xmath2 was chosen for the two samples was such that the intermediate field flux - flow was observed in both the systems when the field is varied isothermally in the zfc mode .",
    "the measured resistance is , however , found to be zero in the same field regime , when the measurement is performed following the fc protocol ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "this clearly indicates that in this intermediate field regime i@xmath5(h ) is greater than i@xmath2 in the fc mode while i@xmath13 is greater than i@xmath5(h ) in the zfc mode .",
    "thus , i@xmath5(h ) is higher in the fc mode than in the zfc mode . a related history dependence of i@xmath5 in polycrystalline sample of ceru@xmath0 has earlier been reported by dilley et al @xcite .",
    "all these results of transport properties measurements , we believe , are correlated to the anomalous fc response observed in and around the pe regime of ceru@xmath0 in various magnetic measurements @xcite .",
    "however , ( to our knowledge ) no such report of history effects exists for v@xmath1si either in magnetic properties or in transport properties .",
    "similar field - history effects are well known in the rfim systems@xcite .",
    "most experimental information in this regard has been obtained from various diluted antiferromagnets in an applied magnetic field . in zfc mode ,",
    "the diluted antiferromagnet is cooled ( in zero field ) through the zero - field neel transition temperature .",
    "the resultant long range magnetic order is preserved when an external magnetic field is switched on at low temperatures .",
    "this long range order , however , gradually decreases on heating the sample to the high temperature paramagnetic phase .",
    "however , on cooling back now from the paramagnetic phase in the presence of the applied field ( i.e. in the fc mode ) , the sample develops a short range ordered domain state @xcite . the similarity with the vortex state in ceru@xmath0 and v@xmath1si is apparent here , namely the higher i@xmath5 in the fc vortex state of these systems clearly argues for a relatively more disordered fc vortex state .    to draw the analogy further , we shall now deal with the metastability of the fc state .",
    "it has been observed experimentally that the fc state in the rfims are unstable to field and temperature cycling below the phase boundary ; the fc state tend to get back the long range order through such cycling @xcite . to show the similar effects in the fc vortex state of ceru@xmath0 and v@xmath1si we subject the sample to field cycling after the initial field cooling experiment .",
    "we have found that the intermediate field zero resistance state is readily destroyed by a subsequent field cycling through a small value ( of the order of few tens of mt ) and the corresponding zfc state flux - flow resistance is recovered ( see fig .",
    "such metastability is not observed in the low h regime ( h @xmath6 0.8 t for ceru@xmath0 and h@xmath61.9 t for v@xmath1si ) and inside the pe regime ( 1.25t@xmath6h@xmath61.37 t for ceru@xmath0 and 3.48t@xmath6h@xmath63.62 t for v@xmath1si ) ; the zero resistance state is quite stable to any field cycling in these h - regime .",
    "a continuous phase transition from an elastic vortex solid ( or bragg - glass ) to a plastic vortex solid ( or vortex - glass ) has been put forward as an explanation of the pe in various htsc materials @xcite . however , any zfc / fc history effect has not been associated with the pe in these materials so far . although it is widely accepted that the pe in ceru@xmath0 indicates a transition from a relatively ordered vortex solid to a disordered vortex solid@xcite the exact nature of this transition remains a matter of debate .",
    "we have earlier suggested that the existence of a first order thermodynamic phase transition and the associated supercooling can explain various interesting features associated with pe in ceru@xmath0 including the history effects @xcite . here",
    "the history effect is associated with the supercooling of the high field high temperature disordered vortex state ( with enhanced pinning ) across the transition line .",
    "this picture gains further weight by our recent theoretical argument that the range of supercooling will be more while varying the temperature than while varying the field @xcite .",
    "the experimental support in this regard already existed in magnetic studies of ceru@xmath0 , and further support is obtained through our present transport measurements .",
    "there is a finite hysteresis in the field variation of the resistance in ceru@xmath0 between the ascending and the descending field cycle ( see inset of fig .",
    "such a hysteresis in the isothermal field variation of r(h ) , however , is not very distinct for v@xmath1si .",
    "as shown in fig.2 , the path dependence of r(h ) is very clear for both ceru@xmath0 and v@xmath1si when the vortex state prepared through the fc protocol . in spite of all these arguments",
    ", we must point out here that a definite microscopic experimental evidence in support of ( or against ) a first order phase transition in ceru@xmath0 is yet to appear .",
    "the analogy with the rfim systems continues here , since the question regarding the underlying phase transition is yet to be settled in the rfim systems also @xcite .",
    "we have presented results of transport measurements in ceru@xmath0 which , in conjunction with our earlier magnetic measurements @xcite , show clear analogy between the vortex state of ceru@xmath0 around the pe regime and the rfim systems .",
    "our study shows that like in rfim systems , the fc vortex state in ceru@xmath0 is relatively more disordered and metastable in character . in addition , we have shown here the existence of the same features in the well known superconductor v@xmath1si .",
