    "the spectral index in the common portion of the emission is @xmath36 , allowing for the difficulties in `` isolating '' the 325 mhz flux density , while for the remaining part we estimate a lower limit @xmath37 .",
    "such sharp jump in the spectral index is intriguing , and worth it of further investigation .",

    "its overall properties  morphology and linear size , location at the border of the x  ray emission in the direction of the secondary x  ray peak associated with cxouj092053 + 302800 , and the steep spectrum  coupled with the lack of an obvious optical counterpart , suggest that it might be a cluster radio relic ( see also v08 ) . however , the uneven distribution of the spectral index and the southern edge brightening at all frequencies are fairly unusual for relics , and we can not rule out other possibilities , such as a tailed radio source .",
    "we checked for a possible extension of the relic towards the centre of a781 , and/or for a radio halo undetected at higher frequencies .",
    "we carried out flux density measurements over the inner @xmath20 1.5 mpc around the cluster centre on the low resolution images ( from @xmath38@xmath1730@xmath21 to @xmath39@xmath1752@xmath21 ) , and on a residual image obtained after subtraction of the clean components associated with the individual radio sources ( left panel of fig . 1 and table 1 ) .",
    "we imaged the `` subtracted '' u  v dataset using natural weighting to enhance any possible presence of diffuse emission .",
    "our images are shown as colour scale and contours in figure [ fig : a781_lr ] .",
    "the residual image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a781_lr ] , right panel ) clearly shows that the relic extends towards the centre of a781 , in the direction of the double source s6 .    the flux density measured in a central region of @xmath20 1.5 mpc in diameter , estimated by subtracting the contribution of the individual sources ( s4 , s6 and the relic )",
    "does not appreciably change with the resolution , and is of @xmath20 1520 mjy . considering that the total flux density of s4 , s6 and the relic is 379.4 mjy ( see table 1 ) ,",
    "the residual flux density is @xmath205% of this value .",
    "a similar value is found by integrating the residual image over the same 1.5 mpc region .",
    "we thus consider this value an upper limit for the flux density of possible diffuse emission at the centre of a781 , on a linear scale of the order of 1.5 mpc .",
    "the vla l ",
    "band images we re  analyzed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a781_lp ] ) are in agreement with our 325 mhz results .",
    "the different frequencies of the two observations do not allow an accurate subtraction of the individual sources from the vla ",
    "c to the vla ",
    "d dataset , since spectral effects would result in residual flux density from the individual sources subtracted in the 1.398 ghz vla ",
    "d array image .",
    "moreover , the flatter spectrum of the individual sources compared to diffuse cluster sources ( see sect . 2.2 and table 1 ) makes the source subtraction at 1.4 ghz more critical than at lower frequencies .",
    "hence we simply compared the sum of the flux density of the individual sources s4 , s6 and the relic to the total flux density of the l  band images integrating over the whole area encompassing them . no difference is detected in either images , and in both cases the values agree within @xmath40 2% .",
    "the results of our analysis disagree with govoni et al .",
    "@xcite , who recently claimed the detection of a radio halo ( with flux 2030 mjy at 1.4 ghz ) using the same vla archival data .",
    "they also derived an upper limit to the flux density of the radio halo at 330 mhz ( @xmath41 mjy ) using an archive vla observation , pointed 1.5@xmath42 away from the cluster centre , and give an upper limit of @xmath43 to its spectral slope .",
    "our 325 mhz observations are about 5 times more sensitive than those in govoni et al . , and rule out the presence of a halo in a781 with flux density of 2030 mjy at 1.4 ghz . the resulting spectral index , with our improved value of the 325 mhz residual flux density , would be @xmath44 ( using a conservative limit , s@xmath45@xmath4640 mjy ) which is definitely unplausible for diffuse cluster sources .",
    "we point out that one feature in the govoni et al .",
    "residual image is the discrete source s3 , which has an optical counterpart , as clear from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : a781_tot ] and in v08 ; moreover , the sources labelled c and d in their paper are clearly extended in the direction of the residual emission .",
    "a statistical connection between the dynamical state of massive clusters in the gmrt sample ( v07 and v08 ) and the presence of radio halos has been derived by c10 , confirming the picture where mergers switch  on radio halos in galaxy clusters .",
    "a 781 is one of the few outliers in the cassano et al .",
    "diagrams , lying in the region of dynamically disturbed clusters , but with no detected radio halo at 610 mhz ( v08 ) .",
    "the observations at 325 mhz presented in this letter do not allow a firm detection of a radio halo in the central region ( @xmath20 1.5 mpc ) of a781 . if we consider a spectral index @xmath47 between 3251400 mhz , the residual diffuse emission measured in our images , s@xmath0 20 mjy , puts a conservative limit to the 1.4 ghz luminosity of a halo in a781 p@xmath48@xmath1710@xmath49w  hz@xmath10 ( where @xmath50 is the flux at 325 mhz in mjy ) .",
    "our results do not challenge the cluster merger  radio halo connection . on the basis of the p@xmath5l@xmath51 correlation ,",
    "the expected 1.4 ghz radio luminosity of the halo is still consistent with our upper limit . as a matter of fact , the four known radio halos with radio power @xmath52 w",
    "hz@xmath10 hosted in clusters with x  ray luminosity l@xmath53@xmath1710@xmath18erg  s@xmath10 ( i.e. a2255 , a2256 , coma and a754 ) are only detected at low redshift , z@xmath460.1 .",
    "on the other hand , if we assume the 1.4 ghz luminosity recently claimed by govoni et al .",
    "@xcite , the halo would lie about an order of magnitude above the radio / x  ray correlation .",
    "incidentally , in their paper the halo is found consistent with that correlation simply because the authors use the old overestimated x  ray luminosity for a781 , as given in the ebcs catalogue ( see sect .",
    "2 ) .    assuming that the residual emission at the centre of a781 does reveal the presence of an underlying very low brightness radio halo , the combination of 325 and 610 mhz provide further hints on its spectral properties .",
    "the 610 mhz upper limit and the residual emission at 325 mhz imply a spectral index of the emission steeper than @xmath54 2.5 . even accounting for the uncertainty in the 610 mhz upper limit , which depends on the assumptions made on the unknown brightness distribution ( see brunetti et al .",
    "2007 and v08 ) , our experience shows that radio halos with s@xmath31=1020 mjy are well imaged in the gmrt radio halo survey ( i.e. a697 at a similar redshift , v08 ) .",
    "this suggests a conservative upper limit of s@xmath55 mjy , which would still imply a steep spectrum halo , i.e. @xmath3@xmath561.5 .",
    "it is noteworthy that statistical expectations based on the turbulent re  acceleration model show that radio halos with steep spectra should be quite common in merging clusters with masses @xmath57 m@xmath58 , similar to that of a781 ( cassano et al .",
    "we have presented deep gmrt 325 mhz observations of the unrelaxed and luminous cluster a781 , which is a noticeable outlier in the quantitative correlations connecting cluster mergers and the presence of a radio halo ( c10 ) .",
    "our images show that the peripheral diffuse source is the dominant radio feature of the cluster , and only residual emission at the level of s@xmath27@xmath20 1520 mjy is found in a region of @xmath59 mpc around the cluster centre ( implying a conservative flux density limit of s@xmath27@xmath20 3040 mjy ) .",
    "this value improves the upper limit given in govoni et al .",
    "@xcite by almost a factor of 5 , and rules out the claim of a detection of a radio halo at 1.4 ghz ( govoni et al .",
    "2011 ) on the basis of simple spectral considerations .",
    "with our data we can not confirm the presence of a radio halo at the centre of a781 .",
    "if the 325 mhz residual emission is real , then it might trace an underlying halo with steep spectrum .",
    "future high sensitivity observations at lower frequencies combined with deeper observations at 610 mhz will allow us to clarify the nature of the residual emission .",
