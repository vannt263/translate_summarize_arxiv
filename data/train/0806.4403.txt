    "the first approach is restrictive approach which gives rise to more interesting results when the normal families are studied in their own right .",
    "for example the converse of montel theorem holds under this approach .",
    "the second approach is the general approach in which though the converse of montel theorem fails to hold but is essentially required when the normal families are studied from the bicomplex dynamics point of view . during our discussions , we shall come across the situations where the differences lead to interesting conclusions .",
    "besides complete discussion on montel theorem in various situations , we have defined fatou , julia and filled - in julia sets of bicomplex polynomials and their representations in terms of their complex counterparts are obtained for the specific case of non - degenerate bicomplex polynomials of degree @xmath12 .",

    "the three kinds of conjugation all have some of the standard properties of conjugations , such as : @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 . + we know that the product of a standard complex number with its conjugate gives the square of the euclidean metric in @xmath45 .",
