    "polarimetric imagery consists in forming an image of the state of polarization of the light backscattered by a scene .",
    "we consider in this paper that the scene is artificially illuminated with coherent light ( laser ) .",
    "for example , this illumination is used in active imagery in order to combine night vision capability and to improve image resolution for a given aperture size . in practice , using a coherent illumination produces speckle noise that deteriorate the image @xcite .",
    "however , the backscattered light gives information about the capability of the scene to polarize or depolarize the emitted light and thus allows one to determine the medium that compose the scene .",
    "these information can be described by a scalar parameter : the degree of polarization of light .",
    "this quantity is obtained in standard configurations of polarimetric systems using four pair of angular rotations of both a compensator and a polarizer .",
    "four transmittance are thus recorded @xcite that lead to the estimation of the degree of polarization . however , this system is complex and it is interesting to develop methods to estimate the degree of polarization that could reduce the number of images to register . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed to estimate the degree of polarization with only two intensity images , however this method relies on the assumption that the measurements of the two components are uncorrelated which can be in some cases a too restrictive hypothesis .",
    "this paper extends the work of @xcite by taking into account the correlation of the different components .",
    "+ let us first introduce the context of the study .",
    "the electric field of the light at a point of coordinates * r * ( vector of 3 component ) in a 3d space and at time @xmath0 can be written , if we assume the light to propagate in a homogeneous and isotropic medium , as @xmath1 .",
    "e^{- i 2 \\pi \\nu t}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the central frequency of the field and @xmath3 are unitary orthogonal vectors ( in the following bold letters represent vectors ) .",
    "+ the terms @xmath4 and @xmath5 are complex and define the random vector called jones vector @xmath6.\\ ] ]    the state of polarization of light corresponds to the properties of @xmath7 at a particular point of space .",
    "it can be described by the covariance matrix @xmath8    @xmath9\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 define respectively the statistical average and the complex conjugate . for sake of brevity ,",
    "the following notations for @xmath8 are introduced @xmath12 = \\frac{1}{c_1c_4-|c_2|^2 } \\left[\\begin{array}{ll }     c_4 & -c_2 \\\\     -c_2^ * & c_1 \\\\",
    "\\end{array}\\right];\\ ] ] @xmath13\\ ] ] let us note that this matrix can be diagonalized since it is hermitic .",
    "+ in the case of coherent light , the electric field is represented by the complex jones vector @xmath14 which follows a gaussian circular law @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for the adjoint of the vector @xmath17 .",
    "+ the degree of polarization is defined by @xcite    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the eigenvalues of @xmath8 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "+ the degree of polarization is a scalar parameter that characterizes the state of polarization of the light : if @xmath22 , the light is said to be totally depolarized , and if @xmath23 , the light is said to be totally polarized . in the intermediate cases ,",
    "the light is partially polarized .",
    "+ with the notations introduced in ( [ cov ] ) one can show that @xcite @xmath24 the knowledge of this quantity allows one to study the way the illuminated scene polarized or depolarized the emitted light .",
    "this degree gives information about the nature of the medium in the scene . in the standard configuration ,",
    "four measurements are needed to estimate it . in the case of uncorrelated measurements , two intensity images",
    "gives a good estimation of this degree using the osci @xcite .",
    "however , in some cases the uncorrelation of the measurements may be not valid .",
    "+ in this paper , an original estimation method that both uses a pair of images and that accounts for correlation in the components is proposed .",
    "we recall in the following the method proposed in @xcite and we extend it to correlated measurements .",
    "we then compare them through statistical measures using simulated data .",
    "the results are also presented when the standard estimation of @xmath25 is used ( four images ) as this case is expected to give the best results .",
    "finally we conclude and give the perspectives of this work .",
    "in the case of two uncorrelated images , the orthogonal state contrast image ( osci ) is determined from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are intensity measurements at the pixel site @xmath29 , assuming a lexicographic order for the pixels .",
    "+ these two images are obtained with simple polarimetric systems .",
    "first , the scene is illuminated by coherent light with single elliptical polarization state .",
    "then the backscattered light is analysed in the polarization state parallel ( which leads to @xmath30 and orthogonal ( which leads to @xmath31 to the incident one .",
    "+ the osci is an estimation of @xmath25 in each pixel provided that the materials of the scene modify the degree of polarization of incident light without modifying its principal polarized state ( . ] ) .",
    "let us recall that this kind of material is called pure depolarizer . for such materials ,",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath8 is diagonal and , since the diagonal terms represent the intensity images , the osci gives an estimation of @xmath25 with @xmath32 in the case of non pure depolarizer objects ( i.e. @xmath8 is non diagonal ) , the osci still reveals interesting contrast image but no more defines @xmath25 .",
    "this leads us to a new method that considers the cases of correlated measurements .",
    "this is the object of the following part .",
    "in the case of correlated measurements , the covariance matrix is non diagonal and of the form ( [ cov ] ) . in its standard estimation ,",
    "the degree of polarization needs four measurements , however , two images are sufficient to get an estimation of @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , the coefficient @xmath33 is obtained from one measurement , as the coefficient @xmath34 and the squared modulus of @xmath35 can be estimated from the cross - correlation coefficient @xmath36 between two measurements @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we have @xmath39 @xmath36 can be calculated by using the joined density probability function @xmath40 assuming that @xmath41 is gaussian circular ( i.e. the speckle is supposed to be fully developped ) .",
    "it can be shown that the correlation coefficient is obtained with @xmath42 where @xmath43 stands for the modulus of @xmath44 . calculating the centered correlation coefficient defined by @xmath45 after some simple algebra",
    ", we get @xmath46    thus the coefficient @xmath47 can be obtained from two measurements with @xmath48 .",
    "this remark leads to write the following property . + * property a : * _ for fully developped speckle fluctuations , the degree of polarization can be obtained from only two intensity images . _ +   + one can easily note that the degree of polarization can be written as a function of the osci with @xmath49 from ( [ posci ] ) , the degree of polarization estimated from the osci is clearly under - estimated .",
    "thus , we can correct the osci in order to get an estimation of the degree of polarization using the correlation coefficient @xmath50 .",
    "+ in the following part , the different estimation of the degree of polarization are compared to the estimation with four images through simulated data .",
    "we generated @xmath51 experiments of @xmath52 samples of complex jones vectors which follow a gaussian circular law .",
    "the covariance matrix is known and thus @xmath25 is also known . under the assumption that the statistical average can be estimated by spatial averages in homogenous regions ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath33 can be estimated from a single image ( @xmath53 ) like the coefficient @xmath34 ( @xmath54 ) since @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 represents the component of the jones vector for the sample @xmath58 .",
    "+ the estimation of @xmath25 differs in the studied cases by the way @xmath47 is estimated .",
    "three different methods are used :    * case of four images + in this situation , we have both the real and the imaginary part of the coefficient @xmath35 .",
    "the quantity @xmath47 is estimated by + @xmath59 * case of two images with the osci + in this case @xmath35 is assumed to be equal to zero .",
    "* case of two images with the proposed approach + the coefficient @xmath47 is estimated using ( [ cross_coef0 ] ) with + @xmath60    in the three cases , @xmath25 was estimated from the relation ( [ deg_pol ] ) with the estimated parameters . +",
    "in order to characterize the precision of the estimation , one considers six examples of matrix @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath61 ;   \\gamma_2=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 16 & 0\\\\ 0 & 3.6 \\end{array}\\right];\\ ] ]    @xmath62 ;   \\gamma_4=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 18 & 7 + 8i\\\\ 7 - 8i & 11 \\end{array}\\right];\\ ] ]    @xmath63 ;   \\gamma_6=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 1.25 & 5.5i\\\\ -5.5i & 26 \\end{array}\\right];\\ ] ]    these matrices were chosen such as the degree of polarization are approximatively in @xmath64 .",
    "+ the simulations are performed for @xmath65 realisations of @xmath66 samples for the six covariance matrices . for the two matrices @xmath67 and @xmath68 , supplementary cases have been studied when @xmath52 @xmath69 @xmath70 .",
    "the results are presented in figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] .",
    "several points are important to notice .",
    "first of all , as expected , the best estimations of the degree of polarization , regarding all the cases tested , was achieved with four images .",
    "however the proposed approach that relies on two correlated images produces good estimations of the degree of polarization whatever the covariance matrix is used ( fig.[fig1 ] ) as soon as @xmath71 ( fig.[fig3 ] and fig.[fig5 ] ) . note that the estimation with the osci gives results which can not be used if the term @xmath72 is too high ( for example if @xmath47 is non negligible ) .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] , [ fig4 ] and [ fig6 ] show that the experimental variance using four measurements or the osci are comparable whatever @xmath8 and @xmath52 are , whereas the variance obtained with the proposed approach is larger",
    ". however this precision should be sufficient for some practical applications .",
    "this point should be studied in details in a future work .",
    "we have proposed a new approach to estimate the degree of polarization on polarimetric images degraded by speckle noise . assuming that the speckle is fully developped , this method allows one to estimate this degree with only two intensity images whereas four images are needed in a standard experimental setup .",
    "this presents a great interest in term of reduction of cost of the imagery system since the original setup can be simplified .",
    "the proposed approach has been tested on simulated data and compared to the standard estimation techniques that requires either 4 images or 2 independant images ( osci ) .",
    "the results show that the proposed method gives good approximation of the degree of polarization .",
    "this study needs to be extended with a theoritical analyses in order to precise the conditions of validity of the proposed approach ."
