    "the choice of method for microscopic observation is in most cases limited by the possibility of sample preparation .",
    "this is particularly significant in biology of live cells , where the sample is sensitive to any sub - optimal growth conditions .",
    "it is known for many years that minute diffracting objects of 25 nm in diameter may be observed inside the living cell at high light intensities .",
    "this article describes a mathematical and technical method which utilize an ordinary bright - field microscope to obtain localization of objects inside a live cell up to the voxel of 34 @xmath0 34 @xmath0 130 nm@xmath1 .",
    "we believe that this approach may constitute a breakthrough in the microscopy of diffracting nano - objects in general and live cells in particular .",
    "bright - field microscopy is a classical method , favored for its convenience and ability to observe the physiology and morphology of unlabelled living cells and tissues .",
    "it avoids potentially complicated sample preparation procedures and visual artifacts due to complex optical paths and , in addition , is non - destructive . however , the main issue that hinders the segmentation and analysis of bright - field microscopy images@xcite is the low contrast of structures in the focal plane caused by distortions from an object spread function ( osf ) , which is unknown for most objects .",
    "these distortions are particularly relevant in a biological context , as biological specimens are significantly thicker than the depth - of - field of typical bright - field microscope lenses@xcite and also have particular physicochemical properties that lead to optical inhomogeneities and further complicate the osf .",
    "its analysis is in addition complicated by the dynamic nature of living cells , which causes spatiotemporal changes in the image .",
    "finally , the discretization performed during image capture may also produce inaccuracies .",
    "the resulting standard bright - field microscopy image represents multiple processes and exhibits a multifractal character .",
    "these issues impose several constraints on the type of algorithm and microscope appropriate for this task :    1 .",
    "it is necessary to obtain the most real and natural images possible in order to discover the spectral properties of a cell s spread function .",
    "this can be carried out using a high - resolution camera equipped with an image sensor overlaid with a bayer filter , capturing raw files in a higher - bit colour depth and processing them using an non - interpolating algorithm.@xcite precise microscope mechanics should ensure the smallest possible movement along the z - axis .",
    "2 .   the analytical method must be able to recognize spontaneous and random processes that underlie self - organization and multifractality.@xcite extracting the information from an image using rnyi entropy@xcite parametrized by @xmath2 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) serves as an appropriate basis for this task .",
    "3 .   the method must be sensitive to diffraction , which is the main interactive process between light and cellular structures .",
    "properties of the light wavefront that arises from diffraction and is projected at the objective lenses are described in full by mie scattering theory.@xcite under the condition that the size of a particle is much larger than the wavelength of light , ray tracing techniques ( geometry optics ) provide a sufficient model for the characterization of the shape of the particle .",
    "then , the behaviour of light at the interface of the strong diffracting object can be described by the phenomenon of total external light reflection and diffraction ( * supplementary fig . 1b * ) .",
    "4 .   the method must recognize the focus of the cell in its spread function . according to the extended nijboer - zernike ( enz ) theory,@xcite",
    "the focus of a fluorescent and light - diffracting object is located at the position of the highest and lowest energy density , respectively ( * supplementary fig . 1a * ) .    here",
    ", we demonstrate a novel mathematical approach to reach superresolution in bright - field microscopy .",
    "this method , validated using atomic force microscopy , was applied to 3-d reconstructions and spectral and dynamic analysis of organelles and osfs from z - stacks of bright - field microscopy images of live mammalian cells .",
    "the method is demonstrated on two cells of mg-63 human osteosarcoma ( labelled * a * and * b * ) from different cultivation batches and a cell of l929 mouse adipose tissue ; the z - stacks of 12-bit bright - field microscopic raw files were collected with an average z - step of 119 , 150 , and 158 nm , respectively .",
    "the detailed scanning conditions are described in * table 1*. the z - stacks underwent image pre - processing such as vertical image registration ( the mg63-*a * cell ) and the removal of defective ( dead and hot ) camera pixels ( the mg63-*b * and l929 cells ) to avoid image defects , which , in addition , demonstrates the robustness of the method .    the overall preview of the image processing of the z - stack of the input data12-bit raw files with a cell of interest and background  with respect to the items mentioned above is shown in * fig .",
    "1a * and discussed in detail in the following sections .",

    "* d *  calculating @xmath7 ( pdg ) values from two consecutive z - stack images ; * a2 *  characterization of the background of each image as a mode of its r- , g- , and b - intensity histograms , respectively ; ]",
    "in the first step , a cell of interest was segmented from its background by identifying green pixels whose intensities remain unchanged for each two consecutive raw files ( * algorithm 1 * , * fig . 1b * ) .",
    "the intensities of the green pixels in each bayer mask quadruplet were averaged to give quarter - resolved grayscale images,@xcite which were then subtracted . the unchanged intensities ( i.e. zero values in the differential image )",
    "concurrently higher than 0 and lower than a 0.95-fold intensity mode of the cell - free second image contributed to the cumulative binary mask . in the focal region , these unchanged dark green pixels are the primary contributors to the cumulative binary mask ( * supplementary video 1 * ) .",
    "this binary mask was further processed by standard morphological operations  dilating the image ( a 3-px disk - shaped structuring element ) , filling image holes ( corresponding , in the original image , to the fluorescent objects and positive light interferences in the airy diffraction pattern,@xcite ) and filtering the cell of interest according to its specific features ( in our case , as an object of the maximal size)resulting in a final binary mask .",
    "the final binary mask of the cell was rescaled by a factor of two and applied to the whole z - stack of the original raw files in order to distinguish a sum of point spread functions of the cell .",
    "computation of the binary mask from raw files red and blue pixels did not give the desired results .",
    "due to the high frequency of consecutive pixels with constant intensities , the image of the cell merged with its background .",
    "the reason for this may be found either in light absorption in the infra - red and ultra - violet regions@xcite or in lower photon quantum efficiency of the respective camera filters.@xcite therefore , in all segmentations , the green intensity wide range histogram was used .",
    "the next step consists of selecting the focal sub - stack of the cell and assessing cell topography .",
    "the focal region of the z - stack was determined via clustering point information gain entropy density ( @xmath6 ) spectra@xcite obtained for all raw files of the separated cell .",
    "the variable @xmath6 [ bit ] was derived from the rnyi entropy as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the probabilities of occurrence of intensity @xmath11 in an intensity histogram of the @xmath12-th image in the z - stack with and without an element of the intensity @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the additive term @xmath14 is called a point information gain ( @xmath15 , bit ) and can determine an information contribution of intensity @xmath11 to the intensity histogram obtained from either the whole image ( a global measure @xmath16 ) or its part ( local measures ) . for image processing of the presented cells",
    ", we used local values evaluated from pixels either on the vertical - horizontal cross ( @xmath17 ) or on a 9-px circle around the examined pixel ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the kind of local information was chosen according to the distribution of intensities in the image . whereas the z - stacks of the mg63-*a * and l929 cells suffered from cross camera noise , the images of the mg63-*b * cell did not ( * supplementary videos 23 * ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the 9-px circular type of surroundings approximately traced the borders of intracellular structures .",
    "for the overall multifractal characterization of the images , @xmath6-spectra were calculated for a set of @xmath190.1 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , 0.99 , 1.3 , 1.5 , 1.7 , 2.0 , 2.5 , 3.0 , 3.5 , 4.0@xmath20 , for each colour channel separately .",
    "while the values @xmath21 , and consequently @xmath22 , for the red and blue channels ( indexed @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ) were computed by eliminating one element of intensity @xmath11 from the respective intensity histogram , these values for the green pixels ( indexed @xmath25 ) were obtained via eliminating two elements that were relevant to the intensities of the bayer mask quadruplet .",
    "matrices composed of vectors that specify each image @xmath12 in the z - stack via @xmath2-dependent subvectors of the respective information context in the respective colour channel , i.e. @xmath26\\ ] ] for series of the mg63-*a * and l929 cells and @xmath27\\ ] ] for the series of the mg63-*b * cell , were standardized with z - scores and underwent k - means clustering ( squared euclidean distance metric , 50 iterations ) into two groups ( * algorithm 2 * ) . due to the spectral properties of the osf ,",
    "this clustering properly selected a focal region of the cell from the rest of the z - stack .    in * algorithm 2 * , the sub - stack of the focal region was chosen as a cluster with a raw file whose average intensity of green pixels is the inflection point of the dependence of the average intensity of green pixels on the position of the raw file in the z - stack . to smooth the dependence ,",
    "a fourth - order polynomial was used .",
    "this part of the algorithm assumes that in the focal region the intensities over the z - stack change significantly , whereas the intensities of blurred images remain relatively constant .",
    "the topological envelope of the cell ( explained as a binary image at each z - level , * algorithm 3 * ) was evaluated from the focal sub - stack of raw files as the absolute value of the subtraction of the unblurred and blurred green pixels at the same z - level after non - interpolating de - mosaicing of green pixels of raw files .",
    "the blurring of each particular image was performed with a filter created from a 10-px disk - shaped structural element .",
    "after that , the pixels of interest at each z - level were chosen as those brighter than twelve times the maximal intensity of the subtracted image .",
    "these pixels underwent a morphological closing ( a 3-px disk - shaped structuring element ) , removing the undesirable pixels via morphological erosion and dilation , and computation of the binary convex hull around the rest of the binary objects .",
    "a subsequent dilation of the binary convex hull ( a 20-px disk - shaped structuring element ) ensured extension and rounding of the cell boundaries .    from each series , a multiplication of the number of images in the focal region by the respective average scanning step ( * table 3 * ) gave us a height of the part of the osf that is occupied by the cell , i.e. 5.6 , 3.6 , and 5.4 @xmath28 m for the mg63-*a * , mg63-*b * , and l929 cells , respectively .",
    "the shapes and the heights of the cells ( * fig . 3b * and * supplementary fig .",
    "23b * ) obtained from the bright - field microscopy images using the presented algorithm are in agreement with live cell imaging using atomic force microscopy@xcite ( * supplementary fig . 4 * and * supplementary information 1 * ) . in the mg-63 cell line , hill - shaped cells with a protuberant nuclei , of the size of 5.2 @xmath29 1.1 and 4.0 @xmath29 1.0 @xmath28 m on different substrates , prevail .",
    "l929 cells are approximately 0.4 @xmath28 m lower and flatter .",
    "similar results have been depicted in scanning microscopy images and described in literature.@xcite for the microscopy experiments , the dish bottoms were not treated .",
    "this section describes how to extract information about the 3-d shapes and dynamics of organelles from a focal region of a z - stack of bright - field optical transmission micrographs of a detached cell .",
    "the sub - stacks of the mg63-*a * , mg63-*b * , and l929 cells were obtained with average z - step sizes of 116 , 156 , and 147 nm and with a scanning frequency of 0.440 , 0.213 , and 0.298 img .",
    "s@xmath30 , respectively ( * table 3 * ) .",
    "in order to maximize and analyze the change in the osf s volume , we have previously derived a information - entropic variable point divergence gain@xcite ( pdg : @xmath7 , bit ) , which evaluates the information divergence for all pixels between two consecutive raw files in the focal section of the z - stack : @xmath31 where @xmath12 is the order of an image in the focal region of the z - scan , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are coordinates of the particular pixel in the image @xmath12 . probabilities @xmath34 and @xmath35 describe the frequencies of occurrence of colour intensities in the image @xmath36 and in the same image after exchanging the pixel at coordinates @xmath37 for the pixel at @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath7-values for pixels of each colour in the raw file s quadruplet were calculated in the same way as the @xmath6-values in * eq .",
    "1 * : red and blue channels of the resulting quarter - resolved @xmath39-matrices were computed after exchanging one pixel of the respective colour , whereas the green channel was obtained after exchanging two green pixels of the respective pixel quadruplet .",
    "compared to the simple subtraction of two consecutive images , calculating @xmath7-values classifies the image pixels with respect to their probability of occurring in volume and also introduces dynamics into the examined system .",
    "zero values of @xmath7 correspond to pixels with relatively high occurrences in the image , and thus ones that do not change in a z - step .",
    "these represent stable , large , non - moving objects at a high image resolution and the smallest possible z - step , mainly organelles down to the size of one voxel .",
    "the more extremely negative or positive values of @xmath7 show pixels with the highest change from image to image , which correspond mainly to moving objects .",
    "other @xmath7-values detect either sums of point spread functions of organelles or organelles themselves , which are composed of lower - occurrence intensities at the given z - level and , concurrently , whose osfs are divergent over distances smaller than the size of the z - step .    here , coefficient @xmath2 represents multifractality and defines distribution .",
    "low values of @xmath2 merge frequently - occurring @xmath7-values and separate rare pixels ",
    "the most dynamic organelles in this case .",
    "high @xmath2 values give wider distributions of @xmath7-values .",
    "a suitable value of this parameter must be always derived or estimated with regards to the multifractal character of the given intensity distribution .",
    "we decided to use @xmath2 equal to 5 ( mg63-*a * ) and 6 ( mg63-*b * , l929 ) , at which value the images of the organelles osfs , mainly in the green channel , are adequately condensed after camera noise and another defects in the image are suppressed ( * fig .",
    "2a * , * fig . 3c * , and * supplementary figs .",
    "23a * ) . at zero @xmath7 of a higher - order @xmath2",
    ", we already observe a strong combination of intensities of light - interferences in the image . as the size of the z - step increases ,",
    "larger @xmath2-values must be used to merge the correct image intensities .",
    "analysis of @xmath7-values in each colour channel showed that there is mainly autofluorescence projected in the blue channel .",
    "the green channel further displays diffraction .",
    "the red channel shows also the contribution of near infra - red absorption .",
    "the application of each colour channel can be viewed when zero @xmath7-values are compared with original images ( * fig . 2b * ) and provide a potential for classification and recognition of organelles with the respect to their composition , without the usage of any labelling technique ( cf.@xcite ) .    because computing @xmath7-values for three consecutive z - stack images gives information about the shape and dynamics of organelles in the middle image , a binary mask for segmenting objects in a z - level was created by thresholding and uniting identical @xmath7-values from two consecutive @xmath7-matrices ( input 2 in * fig . 1c * ) .",
    "this mask was applied to the respective quarter - resolved image of the cell ( input 1 in * fig . 1c * ) , which was obtained by adapting the bayer quadruplet s pixels of red , blue and average green to the respective colour channel .",
    "the subsequent matching of the respective binary topological mask ( input 4 in * fig . 1c * ) with the image of the detached objects selected objects relevant for the given z - level ( * algorithm 4 * ) .",
    "the last part of the algorithm ( input 3 in * fig . 1c * ) filtered irrelevant intensities from the images , which completely describe the spectral properties of the cell s image . for each colour channel , strongly light - diffracting or absorbing organelles",
    "were detached as those darker than the cell - free background .",
    "in contrast , light - emitting organelles were reconstructed from intensities brighter than the background ( * fig .",
    "1-b1b3 * , * algorithm 4 * ) .    in this paper , we demonstrate a novel method for 3-d reconstruction and examination of large homogeneous non - moving cellular objects , which are projected at the most frequent value of @xmath7 = 0 ( * fig . 3c * and * supplementary fig .",
    "23c * ) . apart from the large homogeneous non - moving objects ( e.g. nucleoli in diffraction ) , the method detected objects of the size of a few voxels,@xcite which might be shown to be real objects by video - enhanced microscopy or correspond to other frequent intensities remaining constant through a z - step .",
    "the osfs of light - diffracting objects are substantially smaller than those of light - emitting objects , which implies that transmission microscopy has an advantage over fluorescent microscopy in biological experiments ( * supplementary fig . 1a",
    "* ) . the consistently smaller number of detected objects in the green channel is probably caused either by the mathematical averaging of two green pixels of the bayer mask quadruplet during the calculation of @xmath7-values or by the broader green spectrum ( caused by technical reasons , as noted above ) decreasing the probability of occurrence of the same intensity between two consecutive pixels .",

    "knowing the distribution and mutual interactions of biomolecules can help determine the morphological and physiological state of a cell . since the 17th century,@xcite observations of intracellular processes have been provided by microscopic techniques based on different physical principles .",
    "imaging based on fluorescent microscopy has been a leading technique for defining the subcellular location of proteins for decades .",
    "however , fluorescent protein tagging technology suffers from some limitations , including the need for a physiological level of light - emitting protein production , mislocalization artifacts , relatively low resolution , and the necessity to intervene in the cell s physiological state after insertion of a dye.@xcite the breakage of the abbe diffraction limit@xcite in fluorescent microscopy was achieved by the invention of super - resolved fluorescent imaging , which was awarded the 2014 nobel prize in chemistry.@xcite on the other hand , contrast techniques in optical microscopy such as phase contrast,@xcite differential interference contrast,@xcite digital microscopic holography,@xcite interferometric microscopy,@xcite and optical coherence tomography@xcite require the insertion of an optical element into the optical path of the microscope , which distorts the image of the observed biological specimen and makes image interpretation much more difficult .",
    "electron microscopy ( in both transmission and scanning modes ) is an ancillary method in cell biology , since it may only be used to observe dried samples after a preparation time of several days .",
    "however , the resolution obtained by electron microscopy may go down to a few nanometers .",
    "the newest imaging method  atomic force microscopy , e.g.@xcite  is a kind of non - optical topographical technique that reaches high resolution but does not provide the possibility of fully imaging intracellular composition and interactions . connecting the benefits of these different imaging methods can be achieved by combining them ; for instance , correlative light electron microscopy ( clem , e.g.@xcite ) is the most well - known and commercially available example of combined imaging .",
    "this article reports a method to comprehensively analyze the information provided by label - free bright - field photon transmission microscopy ( calibrated and validated by afm,@xcite ) , which detects minute objects of nobelish resolution@xcite in a living cell .",
    "we do not develop a quantum physical theoretical foundation of the origin of information in the image .",
    "we instead follow the extended nijboer - zernike theory,@xcite which claims that the focus is at the position of the lowest / highest density of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "provided that two points of the same energy detected by a digital camera chip lie above each other , they are considered to be a light - diffracting or light - emitting object . the extent of the detection as well as of the reliability of the interpretation is heavily limited by the microscope s optical and mechanical properties .",
    "the resolution limit is not influenced by the camera sensitivity but by the number of photons .",
    "a high number of photons enables objects to be localized ( known as discriminability).@xcite it is an analogy to super - resolved fluorescence microscopy , where the limit is based on a few photons .",
    "we demonstrate some of the extraordinary properties of an image of elementary light - diffracting , light - emitting , or light - absorbing objects .",
    "objects of the size of one camera pixel are detected .",
    "to re - phrase this observation in the terminology of the depth - of - focus in digital microscopy : the depth of focus is a step along the z - axis within which the information contained in one camera pixel remains within this pixel and is not transferred into the neighbouring pixel .",
    "our results demonstrate that such a definition is very sharp .",
    "it means that each point in the image of @xmath7 will be equal to 0 .",
    "the fact that we have observed only a few points at @xmath7 = 0 indicates that objects spread functions , which give rise to the image in these camera points , have homogeneous intensity over more than one z - level .",
    "the latter conclusion indicates that objects detected with @xmath7 = 0 at all @xmath2 values are located within the volume of the voxel . for these objects ,",
    "the information obtained by our approach is equivalent to a 3-d reconstruction constructed from electron microscopy images .",
    "the detection limit of other objects , which gives rise to a certain distortion in the optical paths , is solely technical .",
    "it is due to mechanical precision in the z - step and x - y reproducibility , the size of the camera pixel , the objective magnification , a simple optical path , homogeneous illumination , the scanning frequency , the distribution of camera noise , the bit depth of the camera , and image storage and computational capacity .",

    "<S> current biological and medical research is aimed at obtaining a detailed spatiotemporal map of a live cell s interior to describe and predict cell s physiological state . </S>",
    "<S> we present here an algorithm for complete 3-d modelling of cellular structures from a z - stack of images obtained using label - free wide - field bright - field light - transmitted microscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the method visualizes 3-d objects with a volume equivalent to the area of a camera pixel multiplied by the z - height . </S>",
    "<S> the computation is based on finding pixels of unchanged intensities between two consecutive images of an object spread function . </S>",
    "<S> these pixels represent strongly light - diffracting , light - absorbing , or light - emitting objects . to accomplish this , </S>",
    "<S> variables derived from rnyi entropy are used to suppress camera noise . using this algorithm , the detection limit of objects </S>",
    "<S> is only limited by the technical specifications of the microscope setup  we achieve the detection of objects of the size of one camera pixel . </S>",
    "<S> this method allows us to obtain 3-d reconstructions of cells from bright - field microscopy images that are comparable in quality to those from electron microscopy images .    </S>",
