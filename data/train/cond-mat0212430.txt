    "granular media share properties with both usual liquids and solids : they can sustain an inclined free surface without flowing but , when the angle exceeds a critical value identified since coulomb  @xcite with some effective macroscopic friction angle @xmath0 , an avalanche occurs .",
    "the motion has the peculiarity of being a surface flow .",
    "two phases can be observed : a `` solid '' phase experiencing a creep motion where the averaged streamwise velocity decreases exponentially with the depth  @xcite , and a flowing phase exhibiting a linear velocity profile with a velocity gradient independent of the flowing layer thickness , the angle between the mean flow and the horizontal , and the coefficient of restitution of the beads  @xcite .",
    "such profiles can not be described using any conventional local and univocal constitutive laws of continuum mechanics for two main reasons : ( i ) the velocity gradient is found to be constant in the cascading layer whereas momentum balance implies that the shear stress increases linearly with depth and ( ii ) the velocity profile in the flowing layer down an erodible bed differs significantly from the bagnold - like velocity profile observed in dense flows down rough inclines  @xcite .",
    "several models have been recently proposed to describe dense granular flows  @xcite , but , to our knowledge , none of them succeeds to account for the velocity profile measured experimentally in surface flows .    a very recent experiment  @xcite",
    "has provided evidence of multi - scale rigid clusters embedded in the flow that may be responsible for non - local interactions in surface flows .",
    "consequently , following the work of mills _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite originally devoted to dense flow down a rough incline , we propose here to describe the surface flow rheology through a non - local constitutive law .",

    ", we focus more specifically on steady surface flows in a _ slowly _ rotating _ large _ drum of _ finite _ thickness .",
    "the resulting model describes the experimental observations successfully .",
    "let us consider surface flows of monodisperse spheres of diameter @xmath1 and of density @xmath2 in the gravity field @xmath3 .",
    "assuming that granular media deal with continuum models , the velocity and stress field should verify the momentum equation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the velocity of the fluid particle , @xmath6 the volume fraction and @xmath7 the stress tensor . in the following",
    ", variables are non - dimensionalized by length @xmath1 , time @xmath8 , and stress @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , only steady , homogeneous 2d surface flows are considered : in the frame @xmath10 tangent to the free surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the projection of the conservation equations gives :    @xmath13    a constitutive law should now be provided to relate these stress profiles to `` observables '' profiles such as velocity and volume fraction profiles .",
    "correlated rigid clusters of grains embedded in surface flows have been experimentally evidenced  @xcite .",
    "their size has the peculiarity to be power - law distributed from the grain diameter to the flowing layer thickness .",
    "consequently no characteristic correlation length scale -  and thus no local stress / strain constitutive relationship  - can be defined .",
    "a non - local rheological law is thus proposed below .",
    "following mills _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , we express the stress components @xmath14 as the sum of a motionless part @xmath15 and an hydrodynamic part @xmath16 .",
    "the motionless components are assumed to keep the relationship they got just before static equilibrium failure and the hydrodynamic parts are evaluated by considering the flow as transient solid chains embedded in a viscous fluid .",
    "this leads to ( see  @xcite for justifications and details ) :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is a constant coefficient related to the mean transient chains orientations  @xcite , @xmath19 the correlation length of the chain network in a shear plane @xmath20 , @xmath21 the internal friction angle of the material , @xmath22 the shear stress in the viscous fluid and @xmath23 the volume fraction of the immobile stack before failure that ranges from the random loose packed limit @xmath24 to the random close packed limit @xmath25 .",
    "since the influence of the initial volume fraction @xmath23 on the rheology is not investigated in this paper , we set @xmath26 in the following .    the internal friction angle @xmath21 is the sum of the particle / particle friction angle @xmath27 and of an angle @xmath28 reflecting the entanglement of the grains  @xcite .",
    "according to the reynolds dilantancy principle  @xcite @xmath28 vanishes when the volume fraction is smaller than the random loose packed value @xmath29 and increases with @xmath6 when @xmath30 to be a maximum when @xmath31 .",
    "consequently , @xmath32 where the maximum value @xmath0 of the internal friction angle can be identified with the angle of repose and @xmath33 is a dimensionless function increasing with repsect to @xmath34 so that @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "for sake of simplicity , @xmath37 is identified with an heaviside function to allow analytical solutions , _",
    "i.e. _ :    @xmath38    expressions for the viscosity are usually obtained from the enskog equation  @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the pair correlation function expected to diverge as @xmath41 in the high density limit  @xcite and @xmath42 is the granular temperature identified with the rms velocity fluctuations . for dilute flows ,",
    "the temperature profile can be determined by a _",
    "local _ balance between the viscous heating and dissipation through inelastic binary collisions  @xcite .",
    "but in dense flows , the kinetic energy of a collision is dissipated within the entire packing through multiple collisions and the concept of a _ local _ energy balance becomes irrelevant  @xcite . moreover , the mean free path is very small and the experimental noise is expected to be sufficient to drive collisions  @xcite .",
    "for all these reasons , we choose here to define an effective temperature @xmath43 _ constant in the whole packing _ , resulting from the global energy balance within the whole system .",
