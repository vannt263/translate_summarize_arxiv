    "    another important pending issue is the overabundance of small dark matter ( dm ) subhaloes ( e.g. moore et al .",

    "although the `` universality '' of the spherically - averaged density profiles ( navarro , frenk and white 1996 , hereafter nfw ) of @xmath1-cdm haloes has gained a broad consensus over the past couple of decades , new evidences based on high resolution simulations have been found against it ( navarro et al .",

    "the hydrodynamical simulations used in this work have been analysed in detail by s08 , particularly the different properties of the simulated galaxy at @xmath7 . in this section , we only summarize their main characteristics to facilitate the interpretation of our results .",
    "the first point to note is that when sn feedback is not included , the gas collapses and concentrates at the centre of the potential well very efficiently . in this case",
    ", the star formation follows the gas collapse and there is no mechanism to regulate the sf activity . as a result",
    ", a stellar spheroidal component is formed very early , consuming most of the gas reservoir and preventing the formation of a disc structure at later times , as it is the case in the nf halo . on the contrary , when the sn feedback is included , the sf activity gets self - regulated as a consequence of the heating and pressurizing of the interstellar gas . in this case ,",
    "disc - like components can be formed , populated mainly by young stars ( s08 ) .",
    "depending on the combination of sf and sn parameters , the baryons settle down determining structures with different morphologies and disc components of different sizes . in some cases ,",
    "the systems are dominated by a spheroidal component .",
    "s08 adopted the standard value of @xmath21 erg per sn event and , then , varied it from 0.3 to 3 @xmath22 erg as shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "as larger values for the sn energy are assumed , the sf is more strongly quenched and more violent winds are able to develop , resulting in lower final stellar and gas masses . in e-3 , where the unrealistic value of @xmath23 erg per sn is assumed ,",
    "most of the gas is blown out , producing the most dm dominated system with the less concentrated dm profile in our set of hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "alternatively , s08 varied the fraction @xmath18 of energy pumped into the cold phase producing a stronger inhibition of the star formation activity due to increased strength of the induced galactic winds ( f-0.9 ) . this particular combination of parameters results in a very extended disc structure .",
    "a decrease in the star formation efficiency ( c-0.01 ) produces a slower rate of transformation of gas into stars with weaker starbursts so that the energy injected into the ism is not able to generate strong galactic winds .",

    "the e-0.7 and f-0.9 runs have been able to produce galaxies with important disc components as a result of the regulation of sf by sn feedback .",
    "these systems have a half mass radius ( @xmath25 ) of 5.72 kpc @xmath26 and 9.74 kpc @xmath26 , respectively . and",

    "the determination of the centre of mass of the haloes is of great importance for the analysis of the dark matter distribution since a displacement could produce an artificial erasement of the inner cusp .",

    "we correlate their properties with those of the galaxy they host .",
    "in fact , the comparison between the e-0.7 and the nf profiles shows that the dm distribution in e-0.7 is more concentrated than in nf , although it hosts a galaxy a factor of two less massive than the later .",

    "these maps provide a picture of both the star formation history and the final stellar mass distribution in each galaxy . those systems with an important disc structure ( f-0.9 and e-0.7 ) have most of the stars younger than 8 gyr located outside the central region , while systems dominated by an old stellar spheroidal component ( nf , e-0.3 , c-0.01 ) have most of their stars in the inner region .",
    "the nf and e-0.7 runs have produced very different galaxies as shown in fig.[histories ] .",
    "the galaxy in the nf run is dominated by old stars , determining a spatially extended spheroid with @xmath40 of the final stellar mass older than 10 gyr .",
    "the system in e-0.7 has a compact old spheroid and an important disc component populated by younger stars .",
    "this disc is able to survive the interaction with satellites at lower redshifts .",
    "their different star formation histories and morphologies are the result of the action of the sn feedback in e-0.7 which was successful at regulating the transformation of gas into stars , preventing the formation of an early , extended spheroid and assuring the existence of gas to form a disc later on .",
    "the sn feedback has also affected the formation of stars in the satellite systems that merged with the main object as we will discussed in detail in section 4 .",
    "a similar trend is found when comparing the e-0.3 and c-0.01 runs .",
    "in these two cases the feedback was not that efficient at regulating the sf activity .",
    "as a result the final stellar masses are only slightly lower than the nf case . but interestingly , the e-0.3 has a more concentrated dm profile than c-0.01 .",

    ", this can be linked to a similar pattern in its formation history : f-0.9 and e-0.7 both have compact old spheroids and extended , inside - out - formed discs . in these last two runs , the total amount of stars within the central region is approximately a factor of two lower than in the case of the nf run .    in e-3 , where an extreme value for the energy per sn was assumed , we obtained the less concentrated dm profile among the cases with baryons .",
    "this profile is weakly more concentrated than the dm - only one .",
    "as expected , the galaxy in e-3 is also the most dm dominated one in the central region , as shown by the total to stellar mass ratio @xmath41 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) . in this simulation ,",

    "[ sigma ] , we plotted the velocity dispersion @xmath42 as a function of the radius from three times the gravitational softening .",
    "we found that when baryons are included the @xmath43 profiles increase in the central regions compared to the dm - only cases so that the temperature inversion typical of the nfw profiles is lost ( e.g. tissera et al . 1998 ; romano - daz et al .",

    ", we found that , in the dm - only case , the temperature inversion is present from at least @xmath46 to @xmath7 , but in the runs with baryons , the inversion profile is never at place ( romano - daz et al .",

    "when baryons are included the central anisotropy tends to increase slightly in most cases , although because of the high level of noise , this result should be confirmed by higher numerical resolution .",
    "interestingly , from @xmath51 kpc @xmath26 , we found those haloes hosting spheroid - dominated galaxies to have weaker level of radial anisotropy compared with the dm - only case ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ beta ] ) .",
    "conversely , those haloes hosting disc - dominated systems have higher velocity anisotropies ( lower panel of fig .  [ beta ] ) .",
    "the analysis of the dm profiles suggests a connection between the dm evolution and the history of formation of the baryonic structures .",
    "we can follow the formation of a halo and its galaxy with time but it is not possible to reliably estimate the dm profiles when the system get smaller because of the high numerical noise present in our simulations . then , in order to assess the evolution of the different runs , we calculated the concentration parameter proposed by alam , bullock & weinberg ( 2002 ) , @xmath52 , as a function of redshift .",
    "this parameter measures the mean dm density normalized to the cosmic closure density within the radius at which the circular rotational speed due to the dm alone rises to half its maximum value .",
    "this parameter has the advantage of being independent of a specific density profile and , as it is an integrated quantity , it can be estimated more robustly at any time . in fig .",
    "[ delta_v2 ] , we show @xmath52 as a function of redshift for the progenitor haloes for our set of simulations .",

    "all haloes increase their concentration as they grow with time .",
    "the dm - only run has the lowest concentration , as expected , at all times .",
    "we note that the relation flattens between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , coinciding with the close approaching of satellites as we will discuss in more detail later on . from fig .",
    "[ delta_v2 ] , we can see that haloes hosting baryons follow different paths between them .",
    "the nf run shows a dm halo which is always more concentrated than the dm - only one but it has a stronger flattening of the relation during the same period of time .",
    "the other haloes do not show such a strong change in the slope , except for c-0.01 run .",
    "note that a flat slope is indicating an expansion of the mass distribution in the central regions .",
    "another interesting case is that of the f-0.9 halo which host the most extended and important disc . this system does not show a change in the slope and follows the critical relation even closer than the dm - only case .",
    "a similar behaviour can be observed for e-3 which shows a slightly higher concentration driven by the presence of the baryons that have been able to settle in . in these runs ,",
    "the entrances of satellites presumably cause weaker effects on the dark matter distribution compared to the dm - only run , since they are less massive due to the strong action of sn feedback and are easily disrupted as they fall in .",
    "recall that the merger trees of these haloes are the same with the only difference being the fraction of baryons and the gas reservoir in each substructure , which depend on the sf and the sn feedback parameters adopted in each run .",
    "so , in order to understand the origin of the different evolution of halo concentration , we analyse the satellites within the virial radius of the progenitor objects as a function of redshift    it has been shown in previous works ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1992 ) that when two systems collide , orbital angular momentum can be transfered from the baryonic clumps to the dark matter haloes .",
    "hence , it might be possible that if the properties of the satellite distribution were affected by the choice of sf and sn parameters , they might also transfer different amount of angular momentum to the dm .    to illustrate the differences in the satellite distribution in each run , in fig .",

    "[ delta_v2 ] ) .",
    "as we can see , at this redshift there is no disc structure within any of the systems ( i.e. there are no particles ordered at cosine @xmath58 ) . and secondly , the distribution of stellar clumps surrounding the main systems is very different .",
    "it can be seen that , in the nf case , the satellites are clearly more massive and have been able to survive further in the halo since stars are more gravitationally bounded .",
    "those systems that later on are able to develop a disc component ( e-0.7 and f-0.9 ) show smaller stellar satellites .",

    "[ massint ] where we show the cumulative mass of the satellites for each component ( dark matter , gas and stars ) as a function of the distance to the centre of mass at @xmath57 . for the stellar component ,",
    "the satellites of the nf run are the most massive one , while those in e-0.7 and f-0.9 are less massive due to the sn feedback action .",
    "the most diffuse and smallest satellites are found in the e-3 halo , as expected .",
    "the gas component behaves similarly to the stellar one , so that those systems with weaker or no sn feedback have also the larger fraction of gas per satellite ( i.e. systems run with strong feedback blow away important fractions of gas ) .",

    "[ sat_mas ] shows the total baryonic ( left ) and dark matter ( right ) mass of the satellites within the virial radius as a function of the redshift .",
    "it can be seen that both components , baryonic and dm , present noticeable mergers or disintegration episodes from @xmath46 indicated by a decrease in the total mass in the identified substructure within the virial radius at a given redshift .",
    "an increase of the total mass in satellites implies that new substructure has entered the virial radius . from this figure",
    "we can also see that the dm associated to the satellites varies slightly from halo to halo as expected since they all share the same merger tree .",
    "however the baryonic mass shows more important differences . in the case of the nf halo , the total baryonic mass in satellites within the virial radius changes weakly with time . however , the rest of the haloes not only have a lower baryonic content , but also experience larger changes as a function of redshift .",
    "after @xmath59 , the main period of satellites accretion is around @xmath60 . before and after that time , there are mainly merger events with the main galaxy or satellite tidal disruptions which feed the background halo .",
    "we can not differentiate between these processes with the help of this plot since it provides the total mass associated to the subhaloes which can be individualized at a given redshift .",
    "however , we carried out a thorough analysis of these subhaloes following their progenitors in time in each run to be sure that we were actually quantifying these effects , without being contaminated by fly - bye intruders .    in order to improve our understanding of the angular momentum content of the central galaxy and the dm , we analysed the specific angular momentum of each mass component of the systems defined at @xmath57 as a function of time .",
    "we chose the systems at this redshift as a reference one because , from this time , we detect the larger differences in the evolution of the central mass concentration of our haloes ( fig .",

    "both systems show the same trend although the acquisition of angular momentum is much larger for the stars in the nf halo for all mass bins , producing a stronger stellar migration and s08 . ]",
    "( roskar et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the associated gas mass in the nf case at the same redshift shows also an increase in its specific angular momentum which is , then , partially lost at low redshifts . in e-0.7 ,",
    "the gas component in outer regions gains larger fraction of angular momentum .",
    "this could be explained by the action of the sn feedback which triggers important gas outflows ( s08 ) .",
    "hence , we found that baryons determining the galaxy at @xmath57 acquired angular momentum which produced its expansion . because baryons dominate the central regions , the global potential well also changes , probably acting against further dm contraction .",

    "[ jtotal ] , these dm particles increase their angular momentum content as a function of redshift and in all mass bins , even in the most central one .",
    "the dm particles in the nf case acquire a larger fraction of angular momentum than those in the e-0.7 case .",
    "note that these dm particles represent the halo at @xmath57 without substructure so the increase of angular momentum is expected because of the angular momentum transfer from the infalling satellites via dynamical friction ( the total angular momentum of the dm halo is expected to be conserved as shown in s08 ) .",

    "( 2007 , 2008 ) , among others , found that , in the absence of baryons , there appears to be a reasonable agreement between theory and observation because the former predicts @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the maximum of the total circular velocity and @xmath64 is the circular velocity at the virial radius .",
    "however , when the effects of baryons are taken into account through the ac hypothesis , results do not match observations since @xmath63 is significantly increased by a factor of two ( navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; dutton et al 2007 ) .",
    "these values are too high for matching the tully - fisher relation .",
    "dutton et al ( 2008 ) proposed that a net halo expansion that reverse the contraction would be required in order to lower the @xmath65 ratio .",
    "a mechanism suggested in this work is sn feedback since a net halo expansion could result from the rapid removal of the disc mass .",
    "however , while gnedin & zao ( 2002 ) found this effect to be too weak to reconcile observations and theory , read & gilmore ( 2005 ) claimed that if this process is repeated several times , a reduction in the halo density could be accounted for .    from our simulations , we can estimate the circular velocities for each component and analyse how the @xmath65ratio varies for different combinations of the sf and the sn feedback parameters .",
    "the circular velocity of baryons shown in fig .",
    "[ vcir ] ( left panel ) reflects the presence of a concentrated dominating spheroid ( nf , c-0.01 and e-0.3 ) or a dominating disc component ( e-0.7 and f-0.9 ) .",
    "the dark matter distributions ( middle panel ) vary between haloes in agreement with fig . 1 , but",
    "in the central region the shape of the total circular velocity ( right panel ) is determined mainly by the baryonic component . as it can be seen from this plot ,",
    "only when an important disc component is at place , the total velocity distribution gets flat in the baryonic dominated region .    in fig .",

    "we can also see how the baryons in the very central region moves outwards , contributing to produce a flatter curve . in the case of the nf run ,",
    "the baryonic circular velocity is very sharp from high redshift and it also shows an outward displacement of baryons located in the central region which is explained by the increase in the angular momentum content of the the stellar component as shown in the previous section .    we have quantified the flattening of the baryonic circular velocity curve by measuring its logarithmic slope ( @xmath66 ) between the radius at the maximum velocity curve and at the optical radius for each simulated halo . from table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we can see that the lower absolute values correspond to the e-0.7 and f-0.9 runs when the disc component is the dominating one . in fig .",
    "[ vmax200 ] ( upper panel ) , we show @xmath66 as a function of the shape parameter @xmath37 of the dark matter profiles .",
    "as we can see , galaxies with lower absolute values of @xmath66 tend to have haloes with the largest @xmath37 parameters .",
    "the less concentrated cases are found when either spheroid - dominating systems were able to form ( nf and c-0.01 ) or in the e-3 run because of its low baryonic content due to the action of very violent galactic winds .",
    "we also estimated the @xmath65 ratio as a function of shape parameter @xmath37 of the dark matter profiles as displayed in fig .",
    "[ vmax200 ] ( lower panel ) . as it can be seen , we found values for this ratio between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "again , those systems where a disc - like galaxy was able to form show the lowest ratios , indicating the existence of flat circular velocity curves in agreement with observational results .",
    "the small disc in e-3 has the lowest ratio which is produced mainly for the fact that the halo has weakly contracted during its assembly due to the very small fraction of baryons retained in the central region .",
    "+     +      the prediction of the effects of baryons on the dm haloes based on ac hypothesis ( e.g. b86 ) is widely used .",
    "however the main assumptions of this approximation , namely that halo particles move on circular orbits , is not realistic .",
    "several studies ( gnedin et al . 2004 ; sellwood & mcgaugh 2005 ) have reported the ac hypothesis to overestimate the level of compression .",
    "possible alternative models have been developed to calculate the contraction of the dm halo originated by the accumulation of baryons in the central region . however , as we claimed in pedrosa et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the response of the dm halo to the presence of baryons depends strongly on the way baryons are assembled ( see also romano - daz et al . 2008 ) .",
    "actually , this has been the main discussion of the current paper . in this section",

    "we found that , as expected , the b86 model ( violet lines ) largely overpredicts the level of concentration and also changes the shape of the dm distribution when compared to the dm profiles obtained from the cosmological runs . the recipes of gnedin et al .",

    "following a09 , we assume a function of the form :    @xmath75    we found that @xmath76 is the exponent that best represent our mass relations . keeping @xmath77 fixed",

    "[ ac1 ] ) . for the spheroid - dominated systems ( nf",
    ", c-0.01 and e-3 ) , we found that they are better reproduced with values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , while for haloes hosting important disc structures ( e-0.7 , f-0.9 and e-0.3 ) , we get @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we have included the e-0.3 case among the ones with disc structure as it was able to develop a small and thick disc with a @xmath84 and , it presents a similar behaviour for the relation between radius and masses ratios than the other two runs with disc galaxies .",
    "the largest contraction predicted for haloes hosting a disc structure is in agreement with our previous results and discussion .",
    "consistently with previous findings , fig .  [ ac2 ] shows that the response of the dm halo to the presence of baryons does not depend solely on the amount collected at the central region but is the result of the joint evolution of baryons and dm as they are assembled .",
    "although it can be seen from the residuals in fig .",
    "[ ac2 ] that our prescription provides a good prediction of the level of contraction , a larger sample of galaxies is needed in order to claim its general validity .",
    "we have studied the dm distribution in a set of runs of a @xmath85 halo extracted from a cosmological simulation , where the physics that regulates the sf activity and sn feedback was varied allowing the formation of galaxies with different morphologies at @xmath7 .",
    "since the underlying dm merger tree is the same in all our runs , the differences in the properties of the dm and baryons can be directly ascribed to the variations in the baryonic physics .",
    "for the same reasons , all simulations have been run with the same numerical resolution so they are affected by resolution in a similar way .",
    "because we are studying the dm distribution principally in the central regions , we have estimated all quantities outside three gravitational softenings . and as a further test of the robustness of our results against numerical artifacts , we have studied the dm profiles in two haloes selected from a fully cosmological simulation with higher numerical resolution .",
    "these haloes host galaxies with different morphologies and reproduce remarkably well our findings ( appendix a ) .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we found that the einasto s model provides the best fit for the spherically - averaged density profiles of our dm haloes .",
    "when baryons are present , the haloes become more concentrated in the central regions .",
    "however , the amount of baryons collected within the inner regions does not by itself determine the response of the dm halo to the assembly process of the galaxy .",
    "when baryons are included , the velocity dispersion increases in the central region compared to the dissipationless case and no `` temperature inversion '' is observed , except for the e-3 run where the fraction of baryons remaining in the halo is very small due to its strong sn feedback .",
    "the slope of the inner velocity dispersion profiles increases with increasing baryonic mass collected at the centre .",
    "we found that haloes hosting spheroidal galaxies tend to have weaker levels of velocity anisotropy than the dm - only run . while those haloes with an important disc galaxy show the highest levels of velocity anisotropy .",
    "the formation history plays an important role in the final distribution of its dm halo .",
    "we observed that those systems that are able to develop inside - out - formed discs , although they host in the central regions a lower amount of baryons than galaxies that formed old extended spheroids , have more concentrated dm profiles .",
    "since all our runs shared the same merger tree , the differences between them can be directly ascribed to their different baryonic evolutions which are determined mainly by the sn feedback .",
    "we followed the evolution of the dm distribution in the central regions with redshift via the concentration parameter @xmath52 .",
    "we found that all haloes increase their concentration as they grow in time .",
    "as expected , the dissipationless run has the lowest concentration at all times .",
    "also , we observed that haloes present a flattening in this relation with respect to the critical relation indicating an expansion of the mass distribution in the central regions .",
    "this flattening differs among the different haloes being larger for those systems hosting an spheroidal galaxy .",
    "this trend can be linked with close approaches of satellites and their properties .",
    "the analysis of the satellites within the virial radius of the progenitor objects as a function of redshift yields that in the nf case , the satellites are clearly more massive and have been able to survive further in the halo , since stars are more gravitationally bounded .",
    "the systems that , at lower redshifts , developed a disc component ( e.g e-0.7 and f-0.9 ) show less massive satellites at all redshifts as a consequence of the action of sn feedback .",
    "as expected , the most diffuse satellites correspond to the e-3 case . by analysing the mass of the satellites within the virial radius",
    ", we found noticeable mergers or disintegration episodes which can be correlated with features in the specific angular momentum content of the mass components .",
    "+ we studied the specific angular momentum content of main baryonic component and its halo from @xmath57 , when the @xmath52 starts to clearly indicate an expansion of the central dm concentration .",
    "we selected the nf and e-0.7 haloes as case studies .",
    "for these cases , we found that even the inner @xmath86 of the stellar mass gains angular momentum as a function of redshift , although the increase is more important for the nf case .",
    "the gas component shows a similar behaviour but , in this case , it is in the e-0.7 run where the gas acquired larger amount of angular momentum induced by the sn feedback which we know is successful at driving galactic outflows ( s08 ) .",
    "the dm halo ( without substructure ) increases its angular momentum content at all mass bins .",
    "again , the larger profits are measured for the nf case which has the most massive orbiting satellites .",
    "hence , the mass components identified at @xmath87 in nf case gained more angular momentum up to @xmath7 than their counterparts in e-0.7 , except for the gas component which is anyway less massive than the other ones . the fact that stars migrate also contributes to change the inner potential well since they are the dominating mass component in the central region .",
    "this , on its turn , probably acts against further dm contraction .",
    "both effects could explain the evolution of @xmath52 and the fact that , when the halo hosts a disc - dominated galaxy , it is more concentrated than when it hosts a spheroid - dominated one . 6 .",
    "the baryonic rotation curves of our simulated galaxies reflect the presence of a concentrated dominating spheroid or a dominating disc component . the total circular velocity in the central regions is mainly determined by the baryonic component .",
    "when an important disc component is present the total velocity distribution gets flat in the central regions .",
    "the evolution of the baryonic circular velocity with time of the e-0.7 run shows that as the disc forms , the curve became flatter out to larger radii .",
    "we quantified the flattening of the curve through the ls and correlated it with the shape parameter .",
    "galaxies with lower values of ls tend to have haloes with larger @xmath37 parameter .",
    "we found values for @xmath65 between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the systems where a disc galaxy was able to form present the lowest ratios , in agreement with observational results .",
    "we have compared our simulated haloes with different ac prescriptions .",
    "we found , as expected , that the blumenthal et al ( 1986 ) model overpredicts the level of concentration and also changes the shape of the dm distribution .",
    "the recipes of gnedin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and a09 are an improvement over the b86 approach .",
    "however , they overpredict the level of contraction when the haloes host an spheroid - dominated galaxy . from our analysis , we have obtained a prescription that provides a better representation for the contraction of our haloes , depending on the morphology of the galaxy .",
    "however , the universality of this prescription should be tested with a larger statistical sample . +",
    "all our findings indicate that the response of the dm halo to the presence of baryons is the result of the joint evolution of baryons and dm during the assembly of the galaxy and in this sense , the cosmological context for galaxy formation can not be ignored .",
