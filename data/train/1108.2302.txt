    "recent observations at both ultraviolet and optical wavelengths have revealed emerging populations of young stars ( @xmath9 200 myr ) well - beyond the 25@xmath10 magnitude isophotal radius ( r@xmath11 ) of a wide variety of galaxies ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",

    "such young populations of stars are seen in the outskirts of spiral galaxies and may signal the ongoing build - up of galaxy disks from the inside - out ( white & frenk 1991 ; thilker et al . 2007 ) . in other cases ,",
    "the formation of these outlying stars was clearly triggered by a recent galaxy interaction ( mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "2004 ; boquien et al .",
    "2009 ) . and in the most distant and luminous cases of so - called outlying star formation",
    ", the emission from these young stars may indicate the presence of a star forming dwarf satellite galaxy ( duc & mirabel 1994 ; boquien et al .",
    "the origin and fate of these recently - formed stellar populations in the outskirts of galaxies remains an active area of research ( bournaud & duc 2006 ; mullan et al .",

    "in this case of ngc 1533 , it appears the outlying hii regions were formed because of an interaction between ngc 1533 and its nearby dwarf companion , ic 2038 , that left a large , low - column density hi ring of gas rotating around the galaxy ( ryan - weber et al .",

    "since this galaxy is bright in the uv , but not detected in h@xmath6 , it is highly unlikely to lie at a similar velocity to the cloud and eldot .",
    "we find eso 481-g017 is dominated by a 120 kpc ( in diameter ) gas disk , although it represents less than 2% of the galaxy s total dynamical mass within this radius . within this gas disk ,",
    "faint spiral arms are evident in the uv indicating eso 481-g017 may be an example of a galaxy building itself up from the inside - out .",
    "there are other galaxies with large hi diameters which are comparable to eso 481-g017 in hi extent , for example : malin 1 ( 220 kpc , pickering et al .",
    "1997 ) , ugc 1782 ( 130 kpc , matthews et al .",
    "2001 ) , and hizoa j0836 - 43 ( 120 kpc , donley et al .",
    "eso 481-g017 shows some evidence of disturbance with evidence for a warp in the hi disk and a filamentary extension on the west side .",
    "there is no clear culprit for this disturbance , but the possible lsb galaxy detected in the optical and uv ( see figure 2 ) could be related .",
    "the hi extension could represent an interaction with a dark matter halo or the accretion of a cold stream of gas .",
    "eso 481-g017 is found to be part of a small group that contains at least two other gas - rich dwarf galaxies ( see table 1 and figure 1 ) .",
    "both of these dwarf galaxies have only approximately 1% of the total hi mass of eso 481-g017 , but could eventually provide additional gaseous fuel to eso 481-g017 .",
    "there are now a number of sensitive , high resolution hi observations that have detected nearby gas - rich groups and/or hi dwarf companions .",
    "for example , a comparison system is ic 2554 which has a hi mass of 3.2@xmath1 @xmath2 and is part of a compact gas - rich group of galaxies ( koribalski et al .",
    "another comparison system is that of ngc 2903 which has two gaseous dwarf galaxies nearby with hi masses between 10@xmath57 @xmath2 ( irwin et al .",
    "the fact that the dwarf galaxies detected in hi are at 195 and 240 kpc from eso 481-g017 in projection is interesting in the context of the location of the gas - rich galaxies in the local group . in the local group , within about 270 kpc the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are undetected or have ambiguous hi detections , while beyond this distance most dwarfs are detected with hi masses @xmath4 @xmath58 to @xmath59 @xmath2 ( grcevich & putman 2009 ) .",
    "this is most likely due to dwarf galaxies that are closer to the large spiral galaxies being stripped of their hi as they pass through an extended diffuse gaseous halo medium . though we do not have deep optical observations to determine if there are nearby gas - free dwarf galaxies , the finding of gas - rich dwarfs only at larger distances could be indicative of a similar phenomenon .",
    "the eldot lies at a projected distance of 43 kpc from the center of eso 481-g017 and has a h@xmath6 luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 which is equivalent to 125 o9v stars .",
    "as mentioned in  3.3 we have discovered a new hi cloud with no optical counterpart lying 11 kpc ( in projection ) from the eldot ( see figures 1 and 4 ) .",
    "the hi cloud has a hi mass of @xmath60 @xmath2 and was found over a velocity range of 4729 - 4740 km s@xmath8 , while the eldot lies at a velocity of 4701@xmath54 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the significant offset in velocity of the eldot and hi cloud from the main galaxy ( @xmath4700 km s@xmath8 ) is mysterious , as well as the positional offset of the hi cloud from the eldot .",
    "could the hi cloud and eldot represent leftover material from an interaction with star formation being triggered at the compressed edges of the cloud ? or do they represent components of a low surface brightness galaxy that has recently begun to form stars again ? in this section",
    "we discuss the origin possibilities in the context of its relationship to other known systems .",
    "both the eldot and the hi cloud have a @xmath4700 km s@xmath8 velocity offset compared to both eso 481-g017 and the two new gaseous dwarf galaxies .",
    "this system is unique in that the vast majority of the hi clouds found thus far are closer kinematically to a nearby galaxy .",
    "for example , kilborn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found 12 hi detections and one extended hi cloud near the ngc 3783 galaxy group .",
    "the isolated region of hi gas has a mass of @xmath61 @xmath2 at a distance of 160 kpc from the closest galaxy and it has a velocity offset of @xmath4170 km s@xmath8 . the authors think that the origin of this hi cloud is due to tidal debris . also , hi observations of the galaxy ic 2554 ( koribalski et al .",

    "2003 ; oosterloo et al . 2007 ;",
    "ryder et al .",
    "2001 ) , but the majority are kinematically ( and spatially ) in close proximity to the nearby galaxy and most are not shown to be forming stars .",

    "2007 , oosterloo & van gorkom 2005 , minchin et al . 2005",
    "; minchin et al .",

    "the cloud virgohi 21 has a hi mass of @xmath43.4@xmath63 @xmath2 and is most likely associated with the harassment of ngc 4254 ( oosterloo & van gorkom 2005 ; haynes et al .",
    "it is over 120 kpc away , but both the galaxy and cloud lie at a similar velocity .",
    "simulations of virgohi 21 also suggest that this hi cloud was formed from tidal debris ( bekki et al .",
    "2005 ; duc & bournaud 2008 ) . the only cloud of similar magnitude in terms of the velocity offset we were able to find is the virgo cloud # 1 studied by kent ( 2010 ) .",
    "this cloud is offset by 1000 km s@xmath8 from the closest galaxy with a velocity .",
    "similar to other clouds in virgo , kent ( 2010 ) thinks the cloud s origin can most likely be attributed to ram pressure stripping of the galaxies in that region . since eso481-g017 is not in a cluster environment and this cloud in virgo is an exception in terms of hi clouds with significant kinematic offsets , it may be unlikely that the hi cloud and eldot presented here represent the leftovers of galaxy harassment .",
    "though eso 481-g017 does have a small filament of hi to the west , it is in the wrong spatial and kinematic direction to have a link to the hi cloud and eldot .",
    "gas left behind from the lsb feature seen in the optical and uv in figure 2 behind eso 481-g017 s hi disk is one possibility , but we do not have a velocity for this feature and it is currently over 70 kpc from the hi cloud and hii region .      with an h@xmath6 luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 , the eldot falls near the peak of model single - burst extragalactic hii region luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this luminosity places it near the  saturation luminosity \" of a single burst of star formation , signifying that the initial mass function of its stellar population is fully populated . a lower limit on the stellar mass of the hii region can be obtained by extrapolating a zero - age salpter imf from the number of o stars indicated by the h@xmath6 luminosity ( 125 ; see appendix a of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in @xmath64  .",
    "the h@xmath6 luminosity is typical of hii regions in general , however , in comparison with other outlying hii regions ( hii regions beyond the optical radius of a galaxy discussed in the introduction ) , most of which are ionized by a single to a few o stars , it is unusually luminous in h@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "for example , the three outlying hii regions of ngc 1533 studied with the high resolution channel of @xmath65 were found to have h@xmath6 luminosities between 10@xmath66 and 10@xmath67 erg s@xmath8 , corresponding to emission from only 20 to 40 o9v stars @xcite .",
    "the outlying hii regions studied as a part of the extended - uv disk of m83 have h@xmath6 luminosities that range from 10@xmath68 to 10@xmath66 erg s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "if these lower level outlying hii regions are also present in the eso  481 - g017 system they would not be detected given the limit of our observations of 10@xmath67 erg s@xmath8 at its distance .",
    "the eldot is most similar in luminosity to the two outlying hii regions of the compact group hcg 16 , with luminosities of 10@xmath69 and @xmath70 erg s@xmath8 , and discussed in ryan - weber et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and werk et al .",
    "given that both eso  481 - g017 ( 52 mpc ) and hcg 16 ( 54 mpc ) are considerably more distant than both ngc  1533 ( 19.1 mpc ) and m83 ( 4.6 mpc ) , we can not rule out the possibility that these luminous eldots are unresolved clusters of several hii regions .",
    "along this vein , werk et al .",
    "( 2010 ) note that , given such high luminosities , these `` hii regions '' may not be single isolated star clusters , but rather complexes of young star clusters and/or star formation in a dwarf galaxies .",
    "this latter possibility is discussed in the next section .      the hi cloud and eldot may represent the gas and star formation of a dwarf galaxy .",
    "the hi mass of the cloud ( 2.6@xmath56 @xmath2 ) is consistent with the range of hi masses found in dwarf galaxies in the local group ( grcevich & putman 2009 ) and the h@xmath6 luminosity ( @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 ) is also consistent with these dwarf galaxies .",
    "for example , wlm has a h@xmath6 luminosity of @xmath42@xmath71 erg s@xmath8 and a hi mass of @xmath5 @xmath2 and sextans b , sextans a and ic 1613 have h@xmath6 luminosities between @xmath72 and @xmath73 erg s@xmath8 and similar hi masses ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "the eldot is @xmath74 pc in diameter based on the singg h@xmath6 images .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than most dwarf galaxies , but on par with other dwarf companions detected in singg images .",
    "the metallicity estimate for the eldot of 0.7 solar is also consistent with the star formation occurring in gas that has previous hosted stars .",
    "if the eldot and hi cloud represent a dwarf galaxy , it is possible they are not related to eso 481-g017 ; however , one thing that needs to be explained is the offset of the hi cloud and eldot .",
    "both the offset and the trigger of star formation traced by the h@xmath6 could be explained if the dwarf is beginning to pass through an extended diffuse medium , potentially the gaseous halo of eso 481-g017 .",
    "this could result in the gas being stripped from main dark matter and stellar component of the dwarf , as well as star formation being triggered as this gas is compressed during the stripping process .",
    "the high velocity of the dwarf relative to eso 481-g017 aids in the efficient stripping and explaining the offset of the hi and recent star formation which is seen in the virgo cluster in galaxies undergoing gas stripping ( crowl et al .",

    "given the offset of 11 kpc and the hii region being @xmath75 myr old , the dwarf galaxy needs to be moving at least at @xmath76 km s@xmath8 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the offset in velocity from eso 481-g017 , but the hii region could also have formed in lower level hi that is not detected here .",
    "there are potential analogs of offset hi and stellar components in dwarf galaxies in the local group .",
    "two dwarf galaxies in the grcevich & putman ( 2009 ) study were listed as ambiguous hi detections because there are nearby hi clouds at similar velocities to the stars , but the clouds do not overlap with the main stellar component . these two dwarf galaxies ( sculptor and fornax )",
    "are at intermediate distances ( 138 and 88 kpc , respectively ) and may have had their gas recently stripped by the milky way s halo medium . the dwarf galaxy scenario",
    "therefore could make sense in terms of what is seen elsewhere in the local universe and may be a complement to the fact that the gas - rich dwarf galaxies are only detected at large radii from eso 481-g017 .",
    "eso 481-g017 may have an extended diffuse halo medium that can strip dwarf galaxies of their gas and the unusual hi cloud and eldot may be a consequence of this process .",
    "deeper optical and hi observations will help to determine if this scenario is correct .",
    "we have discovered that eso  481-g017 is the brightest member of a small gas - rich group and has a large extended hi disk ( @xmath460 kpc in radius ) .",
    "there are two gas - rich dwarf companion galaxies detected and a hi cloud at the velocity of the hii region , which is 700 km s@xmath8 offset from eso 481-g017 and the new dwarf galaxies . the hi cloud and eldot",
    "are offset from each other by 11 kpc .",
    "we investigated several possible origins for the hi cloud and eldot by considering previously known isolated hi clouds and outlying hii regions .",
    "we find they most likely represent components of a dwarf galaxy and that the offset of the h@xmath6 and hi may be explained by the dwarf currently undergoing ram pressure stripping ( possibly as it moves into eso 481-g017 s extended halo ) .",
    "this could lead to the trigger of the star formation with the compression of the gas , as well as the gas being moved away from the stars .",
    "it is also consistent with all of the dwarf galaxies detected in the hi observations ( with optical counterparts ) being found at large radii ( @xmath77 kpc ) from eso 481-g017 , as is also found relative to the milky way and andromeda in the local group .",
