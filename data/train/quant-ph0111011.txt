    "the linear potential @xmath0 is a natural choice for a confining potential in one space dimension .",

    "the dirac equation , on the other hand , appears to be problematic for this potential .",
    "if @xmath1 is introduced as the time component of a lorentz two - vector , no bound - state solutions exist.@xcite if it is introduced as a lorentz scalar , bhalerao and ram@xcite find only a very limited set of solutions , with no obvious correspondence to the nonrelativistic solutions .",
    "such an outcome in the scalar case is unexpected because the klein paradox is not a problem ; positive and negative energy particles both see a confining potential . a nonrelativistic limit for the positive - energy solutions should reproduce the known nonrelativistic spectrum .",
    "this inconsistency in the scalar case can be resolved.@xcite the solution found by bhalerao and ram@xcite turns out to be over constrained . here",
    "we will construct a more general solution and show that the nonrelativistic results are recovered in an appropriate limit .    to see that the dirac - equation solution should match on to the nonrelativistic solution , consider the equation ( with @xmath2 ) @xmath3\\psi = e\\psi\\ ] ] in a representation where@xcite @xmath4 as usual , let @xmath5 and decompose the matrix equation into two coupled equations @xmath6 for energies",
    "@xmath7 near the rest mass @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , and for weak coupling @xmath10 , the second equation yields @xmath11 .",
    "substitution into the first equation brings @xmath12 , which is immediately recognized as the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "the solution to the schrdinger equation is obtained by noting that @xmath13 is the differential equation for a shifted airy function.@xcite this yields the normalizable solution @xmath14\\right)$ ] , with @xmath15 a normalization constant .",
    "continuity of @xmath16 and @xmath17 at @xmath18 requires that either @xmath19 [ for even solutions ] or @xmath20 [ for odd solutions ] .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the nth zeros of ai and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "then the nonrelativistic eigenenergies are @xmath24 for even solutions and @xmath25 for odd .",

    "we would expect the dirac equation to yield these same results in the limit of weak coupling . to see that negative energy solutions do not cause any difficulties",
    ", we can use the methods of coutinho , nogami , and toyama@xcite to prove the following extension of their theorem b : for a scalar potential that is everywhere nonnegative , the positive energy solutions have energy @xmath30 and the negative energy solutions have @xmath31 .",
    "the proof depends on the freedom to pick as real the solutions @xmath16 and @xmath32 to the coupled equations ( [ eq : tildecoupledeqns ] ) .",
    "inner products of @xmath16 and @xmath32 with the terms of these equations yield @xmath33 where @xmath34 has been replaced by a generic scalar potential @xmath1 and an integration by parts has been performed in the first term of the first equation . for positive @xmath35 and @xmath1",
    ", the second equation implies that @xmath36 and then the first equation yields @xmath30 .",
    "analogous steps for negative @xmath35 yield @xmath37 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus the two parts of the spectrum are completely separate , and we are allowed to focus on the positive - energy solutions only .",
    "to solve the dirac equation directly , we use the same representation as bhalerao and ram,@xcite that is @xmath38 for @xmath39 they obtain the coupled equations @xmath40 these equations decouple in terms of their variable @xmath41 , such that for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and for @xmath44 , @xmath45 obviously these are harmonic - oscillator - type equations .",
    "the normalizable solutions can be constructed from the hermite functions@xcite of order @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , as@xcite @xmath49 however , because @xmath50 is always positive , @xmath46 is not restricted to being an integer.@xcite    continuity at @xmath18 requires that @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is defined as in ref .  [ [ ref : bhaleraoram ] ] .",
    "these conditions yield @xmath54 and @xmath55 the latter being the eigenvalue condition .",
    "this condition has a rich set of solutions when free of the restriction to integer @xmath46 ; there are infinitely many solutions for any positive value of @xmath56 .",
    "the sign that appears in the eigenvalue condition ( [ eq : eigencondition ] ) corresponds to the parity of the solution .",
    "the parity operator@xcite is reflection in @xmath57 combined with multiplication by the dirac matrix @xmath58 . because @xmath50 is independent of the sign of @xmath57",
    ", we find that @xmath59 the presence of such a symmetry is , of course , necessary for the match to the nonrelativistic solution .",
    "to recover the nonrelativistic solution , we must take an appropriate limit .",
    "we write @xmath60 and consider small @xmath61 as well as small @xmath62 .",
    "the latter corresponds to large @xmath56 and large @xmath46 . in the limit of large @xmath46,we",

    "we next expand in powers of @xmath68 and @xmath61 , with @xmath69 and use of @xmath70 , to obtain @xmath71 note that @xmath72 is of order @xmath61 at the classical turning point , which sets a natural scale for @xmath57 , and that the nonrelativistic correspondence implies that @xmath61 is of order @xmath73 .",
