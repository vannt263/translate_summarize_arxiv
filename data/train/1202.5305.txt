    "when @xcite compiled a list of relatively bright stars visible in the national geographic - palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) that are associated with reflection nebulosity , he noted that the distance and luminosity for one such star , the @xmath11 cepheid su cas , might be estimated using spectroscopic and photometric observations of the nearby b - type stars hd  17138 and hd  17443 , which appear to illuminate a portion of the same dust complex .",
    "his discovery was very important , given the complete lack in existing surveys of galactic clusters lying within several degrees of the cepheid that might serve as distance indicators .",
    "curiously , the field of su cas was not surveyed in van den bergh s earlier search of the poss for previously - undetected star clusters @xcite .",
    "the sparse group of b stars was subsequently designated as cas r2 , and used by @xcite with other r - associations to map local spiral structure in the galaxy . an initial estimate for the distance to the dust complex by @xcite yielded a value of @xmath12 pc from spectroscopic distance moduli for the three b - type stars",
    "hd  17327 , hd  17443 , and hd  17706 , and the bright m giant hd  23475 .",
    "a later study by @xcite using strmgren and h@xmath13 photometry implied that hd  17327 and hd  17443 were closer than hd  17706 , at a mean distance of @xmath14 pc , versus @xmath15 pc for the latter .",
    "schmidt s result found support in an independent earlier survey by @xcite of b - type stars lying within @xmath16 of su cas .",
    "only a few were found to lie at distances comparable to that expected for su cas , provided it was assumed to be either a fundamental mode or overtone pulsator .",
    "a more detailed study of cas r2 stars by @xcite included an additional star , hd  16893 , associated with reflection nebulosity and an a - type companion to hd  17327 , yielding a small group of five stars , with five additional candidates , lying at an estimated distance of @xmath17 pc .",
    "it was noted that background b - type stars were plentiful in the field , with most , including hd  17706 , congregating at distances of @xmath18 pc .",
    "the inferred luminosity for su cas requires an estimate of its reddening , but the immediate field of the cepheid was surveyed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , and the field reddening appeared to be fairly well established , although with some dependence on localized dust obscuration .",
    "several of the surveyed companions to su cas were found to have intrinsic distance moduli @xmath19@xmath20 near 8.0 , but there were no suspicions at the time that the cepheid might be embedded in an anonymous open cluster .",
    "the situation changed dramatically a few years ago when bruno alessi discovered a sparse cluster of stars surrounding su cas and centred at j2000.0 co - ordinates 02:52:15.1 , + 68:53:19 @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "the cluster , designated alessi 95 , has nuclear and coronal radii of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , and was discovered from an analysis of on - line databases ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the colour image ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) emphasises the large number of blue stars ( b and a - type ) dominating the central regions of the cluster , and also provides a clear picture of the relationship between su cas and its reflection nebula with the surrounding dust .",
    "this study was initiated in order to provide additional information about alessi 95  its reddening , distance , and age  based upon available observational material , and to discuss what it reveals about su cas .",
    "for example , the revised _ hipparcos _",
    "parallax of @xmath23 mas for su cas @xcite implies a distance of @xmath24 pc to the cepheid , consistent with intrinsic distance moduli near 8.0 found for several of its optical companions",
    ". it may therefore be possible to establish the distance to su cas via trigonometric , open cluster , and pulsation parallaxes , which would solidly anchor the short - period end of the galactic calibration of the cepheid period - luminosity relation and strengthen the relationship established by @xcite from open clusters and associations .",
    "an informative set of observations for bright b - type stars in the field of su cas was obtained four decades ago by @xcite , who made photoelectric _",
    "_ measures for 31 of 33 stars lying within @xmath16 of the cepheid on two nights in september 1968 with the 0.9 m telescope at stewart observatory .",

    "the spectra were measured for radial velocity and classified by @xcite using the facilities of kpno , and also remeasured for radial velocity using the pds microdensitometer at the university of toronto , and reclassified by the lead author , for use in the study by @xcite .",

    "given that su cas is the shortest period cepheid in the sample of pulsators with established space reddenings , the small offset of the @xcite reddening with the present result is presumably linked to the original underestimate of reddening for su cas obtained by @xcite .",

    "according to the empirical relationship between fundamental mode and first overtone pulsation periods established for double - mode cepheids by @xcite , the undetected mean period for fundamental mode pulsation in su cas must be @xmath53 days .",

    "the implied mean radius of su cas according to the cepheid period - radius relation of @xcite , which is tied to the almost identical slopes for the cepheid period - radius relation in studies by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , is 25.0 @xmath60 . by comparison",
    ", the surface brightness technique yields a mean radius of @xmath61 @xmath60 , while an independent baade - wesselink analysis using infrared colours by @xcite produced an estimate of @xmath62 @xmath60 .",
    "the last study also summarizes previous estimates for the mean radius of su cas derived from variants of the baade - wesselink method , most of which lie in the range 3045 @xmath60 .",
    "systematic effects can not be discounted , given the small amplitude of the light variations in su cas and the fact that @xcite adopted a projection factor of @xmath63 in their study .",

    "the last three estimates are closer to the value predicted by the cepheid period - radius relation , and it may be that the star s small pulsation amplitude and contamination by its b - type companion limit further improvement .    with the period of fundamental mode pulsation in su cas indicated by its membership in alessi 95 , one can estimate independently the age of the cepheid from existing period - age relations . a model - based relationship derived by @xcite yields an age of @xmath68 for a solar metallicity cepheid with @xmath57 , while a relationship by @xcite calibrated by isochrone fits to open clusters yields a similar age of @xmath69 .",
    "both cited relationships display a dispersion in @xmath42 of @xmath70 , so are consistent with the cluster age inferred from the model isochrones of @xcite .",
    "additionally , the implied age of @xmath41 for su cas from its membership in alessi 95 provides a key point at the short - period end of a semi - empirical period - age relationship for cluster cepheids developed by @xcite , where again the dispersion is no larger than @xmath43 in @xmath42 and the relationship is generated by isochrone fits to clusters containing galactic cepheids .",
    "the luminosity of su cas inferred from cluster membership , namely @xmath9 , can be compared with a value of @xmath71 predicted from its inferred radius and effective temperature via the methodology described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath72 offset from the empirical estimate is comparable to the offsets observed for other cluster cepheids @xcite , and can be partially explained by the nature of su cas : a small - amplitude cepheid lying near the high temperature side of the instability strip , as also argued by its overtone pulsation .",
    "su cas has an unseen b9.5  v companion detected by iue @xcite , and the luminosity inferred for the cepheid according to the implied magnitude difference between su cas and the b - star in ultraviolet spectra is @xmath73 @xcite , closely coincident with the result from cluster membership . the companion , which may also be an ap star @xcite , has otherwise only a small effect on the overall visual brightness and colours of su cas .",
    "confirmation of the location of su cas towards the blue edge of the cepheid instability strip is provided by its observed rate of period change of + 0.024 s yr@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "that implies a rate of evolution for the cepheid that is more than twice as rapid as what is typical of fundamental mode pulsators with periods of @xmath74 near the centre of the instability strip @xcite .",
    "the consistency in the implied parameters for su cas found from such diverse observational material provides further validation of the present results .",
    "this first detailed photometric and spectroscopic study of alessi 95 , the sparse open cluster surrounding the cepheid su cas , produces empirical estimates for the reddening and luminosity of a _ bona fide _ cepheid calibrator .",

    "* adjusted here ) agree closely to within a few percent , to our knowledge the first such instance of a tight consensus in distance estimates by these diverse methods .",
    "future improvement to the cluster zams fit might be possible , for example through a more detailed analysis that accounts implicitly for the metallicity of su cas and alessi 95 members .",
    "that affects zams fitting through small offsets in the zero - point , which is currently calibrated for solar metallicity stars .",
    "given present knowledge of the near - solar chemical composition for alessi 95 stars @xcite , however , only a very minor improvement would be expected .",
    "the inferred field reddening of @xmath8 found here for su cas agrees reasonably well with other independent estimates @xcite , and the effective temperature of 6620k for su cas inferred from its colour via the semi - empirical technique described by @xcite and @xcite is only slightly greater than the values obtained by @xcite from stellar atmosphere models .",
    "any discrepancies between the present results and those of previous studies appear to be minor , except for the inferred luminosity of @xmath9 s.e . , which differs from that found in the earlier study by @xcite , primarily because of an erroneous selection of reflection nebulosity stars associated with the cepheid in that paper .",
    "future work may improve the situation , since _",
