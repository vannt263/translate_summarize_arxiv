    "these features are thought to arise in the interactions between the sn ejecta and he - rich ( and h - poor ) csm .",

    "@xmath0 photometry was obtained using the difference imaging analysis ( dia ) , which is a template subtraction method adapted to the @xmath24 data and detailed in @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "two additional steps were required : firstly , we had to remove the intense background emission .",

    "secondly , we used spectra of telluric standard stars to remove the very broad ( typically saturated in the nir ) atmospheric absorption bands .",
