    "microlensing occurs when a `` lens '' ( star , planet , black hole , etc ) becomes closely aligned with a more distant `` source '' star , whose image it both magnifies and distorts . normally the observer is most interested to learn about the lens , but microlensing data can simultaenously serve as a powerful probe of the source .",
    "if the source transits the lens ( or the `` caustics '' generated by the lens , in the case of binary lenses ) , then it resolves the source , allowing detailed limb - darkening profiles from a photometric times series @xcite or even spectral resolution of surface features like the chromosphere @xcite from judiciously taken spectra .",
    "the lens can also serve simply to amplify the role of the telescope as a `` light bucket '' .",
    "@xcite provocatively titled their report on observations of a bulge dwarf that was magnified by a factor @xmath8 `` using keck i as a 15 m diameter telescope '' and @xcite presented a preliminary abundance analysis for six stars with small magnification ( @xmath9 ) , including this star and two other bulge dwarfs . obviously , this trick could in principle be improved to arbitrary `` diameters '' simply by observing the events at higher magnification .",
    "the problem is that it is extremely difficult to recognize high - magnification events in advance , and harder still to activate large - telescope observations in time to take advantage of them .",
    "the process has been facilitated by microlensing planet hunters , who prize high - magnification events because of their extreme sensitivity to planets @xcite .",
    "@xcite were the first to piggy - back on the microlensing planet hunters , obtaining a 15 minute keck spectrum of the galactic bulge dwarf ogle2006blg265sat magnification @xmath10 .",
    "this star , the first bulge dwarf with a high - quality spectrum , proved to be extremely metal - rich , a fact that might be telling us that the bulge is much more metal - rich than seems indicated by available spectra of giants , but could also just be the `` luck of the draw '' .",
    "the @xcite results therefore substantially raised the premium on obtaining highly - magnified spectra of bulge dwarfs .    on 2 july 2007 , the ogle collaborationogle / ogle3/ews / ews.html ] @xcite announced ogle2007blg349  ( ra=18:05:24.43 ; dec = @xmath11:25:19.0 ) at galactic coordinates @xmath12",
    ", i.e. , 5.1@xmath13 from the galactic center , as a probable microlensing event . the microlensing follow up networkmicrofun/ ] ( @xmath14fun ) began monitoring the event on 18 august to determine whether the event would be high - magnification and on 3 september issued a general alert that it would reach at least @xmath15 two nights hence . on this basis , @xmath14fun organized world - wide photometric observations , whose outcome will be reported elsewhere @xcite and also contacted jgc at the keck telescope to recommend intensive observations .",
    "the ability to obtain high resolution , high quality spectra of galactic bulge stars and to carry out a detailed abundance analysis offers an unbiased way to determine the metallicity distribution of stars in the galactic bulge , as well as their detailed chemical inventory .",
    "our abundance analysis of ogle2007blg349s  is described in the first few sections of the paper , with the key results presented in  [ section_abund_results ] . in an effort to explain our rather surprising results , we indicate in ",
    "[ section_discussion ] how past studies of the brightest giants , which are the only bulge stars for which detailed abundance analyses can be derived from spectra obtained under normal conditions , may be subject to previously ignored selection effects , and how this might impact studies of the integrated light for metal - rich old simple stellar populations .",
    "abundance ratios in the galactic bulge giants and in the microlensed dwarfs are discussed in  [ section_abund_ratios ] .",
    "a brief summary concludes the paper , while an appendix discusses the behavior of selected diffuse interstellar bands in the spectrum of ogle2007blg349s .",
    "in light of the prediction that the magnification of the presumed galactic bulge star ogle2007blg349s  would be very large , we decided to observe the object in an attempt to obtain a high signal - to - noise and high resolution spectrum .",
    "the night of 5 september 2007 was clear at the keck observatory , and the seeing was good , 0.8 arcsec in the optical .",
    "we found the microlensed star , confirmed that it was bright , and took three consecutive spectra , each 1350 sec in length .",
    "the utcs at the end of each exposure were 06:03:14 , 06:27:04 and 06:50:27 .",
    "hires - r @xcite was used on the keck  i telescope in a configuration with coverage from 3900 to 8350   , with small gaps between the orders beyond 6650   .",
    "the slit was 0.86  arcsec wide , giving a spectral resolution of 48,000 .",
    "the magnifications at the times of the 3 spectra were a=350 , a=390 , and a=450 ; apparent @xmath16 at these times ranged from from 13.68 to 13.41  mag @xcite .",
    "hence our observations were carried out at a time when the amplification was larger by a factor of 3 than that of any previous highly magnified star with a high resolution spectrum .",
    "while the snr of the resulting summed spectrum is low for @xmath17  (@xmath18/spectral resolution element at 4500   ) , not unexpected given the high extinction toward the galactic bulge , the snr / spectral resolution element in the continuum at @xmath19  exceeds 90 .",
    "isolated lines with @xmath20  of 15  m  are easily detected at such wavelengths .    according to the microlensing model of @xcite ,",
    "the source passed very close to a cusp shortly ( roughly 2 hrs ) after the third observation .",
    "this means that the limb of the star was magnified more strongly than the center .",
    "we have calculated the maximum effect on the @xmath21 color due to differential magnification of the ( cooler ) limb of the star being more magnified than the center , with limb - darkening included , to be less than 0.005  mag during the spectroscopic exposures , and we ignore it .",
    "we determined @xmath0  for ogle2007blg349s  in three different ways , from line depth ratios of close pairs of temperature sensitive lines , from fe  i excitation , and from the ionization equilibrium between fe  i and fe  ii .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that ratios of the central depth of selected pairs of lines that are close together in wavelength and highly sensitive to temperature can be used to deduce @xmath0  to high accuracy for cool stars .",
    "we checked the 15 such line pairs studied by @xcite . in many cases one or both of the lines were highly saturated in the spectrum of ogle2007blg349s , with central depths approaching 70% of the continuum .",
    "there were only 3 line pairs for which both lines had central depths of 40% or less . using their polynomial fit for non - rotating dwarfs , we find a mean @xmath0from these three pairs of 5350  k.    the fe abundance was determined from 135 lines of fe  i and 11 of fe  ii . as described in detail in  [ section_abunds ] ,",
    "@xmath0= 5400  k produces a deduced fe abundance independent of the excitation potential of the fe  i line and a difference between [ fe / h ] from fe  i versus from fe  ii lines of only 0.08  dex , well within the expected uncertainty of @xmath22 [ fe / h : fe  i ]  [ fe / h : fe  ii ] @xmath22 .",
    "these three methods give a mean @xmath0  of 5431  k , with @xmath23  k. we adopt @xmath0= 5400@xmath24  k. the extinction corrected @xmath21 color can be determined from the light curve of the microlensed star .",
    "the extinction to the source is taken to be that of the red clump stars on the horizontal branch in the neighborhood of the source , which is determined from ogle  ii publicly available multi - color photometry .",
    "we assume that there is no differential extinction between the adjacent bulge red clump stars  mag and @xmath25  mag . ] and the target . with this extinction , the model of @xcite that fits",
    "the two - color ( @xmath26 and @xmath16 , where the latter is in the cousins system ) microlensing light curve for ogle2007blg349s   fixes the flux level of the source to be @xmath27  mag with @xmath28  mag . because the lens lies in the foreground disk @xcite ,",
    "the most probable distance to the source is that of the galactic center , 8.0  kpc .",
    "the absolute magnitude is then @xmath29 .",
    "the bulge star is thus slightly fainter and slightly redder than the sun ( @xmath30   mag , @xcite ) . combining this with the colors of stars along a metal - rich isochrone of @xcite suggests @xmath0  = 5550  k , 1.5@xmath31 hotter than our adopted @xmath0 .",
    "if the extinction corrected @xmath21 color determined in this way is underestimated by by 0.08  mag ( of which 0.05  mag may arise from an underestimate of the intrinsic color of the red clump ) as was suspected by @xcite , who employed exactly the same method for ogle2006blg265s , then the deduced @xmath0  for ogle2007blg349s  would be @xmath32  k , essentially identical to that deduced from the spectrum itself .",
    "we next turn to the surface gravity . with @xmath0  set",
    ", we can determine log(@xmath33 )  from the ionization equilibrium between fe  i and fe  ii , from an isochrone , and from the line profile in the damping wings of a very strong line .",
    "the galactic bulge is old ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "we assume the age of ogle2007blg349s  is 9  gyr . from the isochrones of @xcite",
    ", we find that the main sequence turnoff occurs at 5500  k for @xmath34 ( a metallicity 2.4 times solar ) and no @xmath7-enhancement at an age of 9  gyr . a star at 5400",
    "k can be a subgiant with log(@xmath33)= 4.0 dex , or a dwarf below the turnoff with log(@xmath33)= 4.4 dex .",
    "for an upper main sequence star with a fixed @xmath0 , log(@xmath33 )  decreases by @xmath350.15  dex when the isochrone age is changed from 4 to 9  gyr . similarly , log(@xmath33 )  for a fixed age within this interval and metallicity ranging from @xmath36 to @xmath37 increases by @xmath350.10  dex",
    ". thus our choice of an age of 9  gyr for the isochrone we adopt to determine log(@xmath33 )  is not crucial , nor is the exact choice of metallicity of the isochrone .",
    "profiles of very strong lines with obvious damping wings can constrain log(@xmath33 ) . figure",
    "[ figure_ca6160 ] shows a spectral synthesis in the region of the 6162.2    line of ca  i. a synthesis of the solar spectrum with the same line list gives a very good fit .",
    "the best fit for log(@xmath33 )  is 4.35  dex , supporting ogle2007blg349s  being a dwarf rather than a subgiant .",
    "note that a solar [ ca / fe ] ratio and [ fe / h ] = + 0.5  dex is assumed for this synthesis .",
    "in addition , the @xmath38 of 4.22  mag deduced from the extinction combined with the microlensing light curve is 0.1  mag brighter than that of a 5400  k dwarf with this isochrone , but is 1.0  mag fainter than that of a subgiant from that isochrone with that @xmath0 .",
    "the predicted number density for dwarfs as compared to subgiants is about 4:1 for a salpeter imf , further favoring the star being a dwarf .",
    "we thus feel confident that ogle2007blg349s  is a dwarf just below the main sequence turnoff with log(@xmath33)@xmath39  dex .",
    "the ionization equilibrium between fe  i and fe  ii is satisfactory at log(@xmath33 )  = 4.5  dex .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath0  of 100  k translates into an uncertainty in log(@xmath33 )  of 0.2  dex .",
    "we adopt log(@xmath33 )  = 4.5@xmath40  dex for the abundance analysis .",
    "our keck / hires spectrum of ogle2007blg349s  is full of strong lines with considerable blending and crowding , especially in the blue .",
    "fe  i lines at @xmath41    were ignored , as were fe  ii lines blueward of 5100   .",
    "for all other species , lines blueward of 5200    were excluded . a line list for fe  i and fe  ii was assembled from that used by @xcite in their study of k giants in baade s window and from jgc s personal line list , augmented by selected very weak isolated lines found in the solar spectrum .",
    "equivalent widths and atomic parameters for the lines used are given in table  [ table_eqw ] .",
    "lines with @xmath20  @xmath42  m  were rejected unless the species has very few detected features ; those retained that are stronger than this are the only detected line of k  i and the 5680    na  i doublet .",
    "( the nad lines are much too strong to consider using and are hopelessly contaminated with interstellar absorption . )",
    "equivalent widths were measured using an automatic gaussian fitting routine combined with the measured heliocentric @xmath43 of + 99.47@xmath44  km  s@xmath45 .",
    "the stronger lines were all checked by hand to make sure the damping wings were picked up when appropriate .",
    "the mg  i triplet lines in the region of 6320   , where there is a broad autoionization feature of ca , were measured by hand . for elements with only a few detected lines , all features were checked by hand as well .",
    "the fts solar spectrum of @xcite , available online , was very useful for this purpose . the major uncertainty in the @xmath20  results from the definition of the continuum in the crowded spectrum of ogle2007blg349s .",
    "the abundance analysis was carried out differentially with respect to the sun , since the @xmath0  difference is only @xmath35400  k , and both stars are dwarfs .",
    "we used a current version of the lte spectral synthesis program moog @xcite .",
    "we employ the grid of stellar atmospheres from @xcite with [ fe / h ] = + 0.5  dex and solar abundance ratios without convective overshoot @xcite and with the most recent opacity distribution functions . for consistency ,",
    "the solar model was taken from the appropriate grid of kurucz as well .",
    "spectral syntheses were used for the s  i doublet near 6750  and for the rb  i resonance line near 7800   , which lies in the red wing of a much stronger si  i line .",
    "a synthesis of the ch band near 4320    using the molecular line list of @xcite was carried out to determine the c abundances .",
    "transition probabilities from the nist atomic spectra database version 3.1 @xcite were used in general when available .",
    "since we analyze ogle2007blg349s  differentially with respect to the sun , the adopted @xmath46 values are not crucial , but when `` accurate '' values are available , we used them .",
    "accurate @xmath46 values could not be located for a small number of lines for which we were forced to resort to an inverted solar analysis to assign such ; these cases are indicated in table  [ table_eqw ] .",
    "we used damping constants from @xcite when available .",
    "we set the microturbulent velocity @xmath47 to 1.0  km  s@xmath45 , following the example of the sun .",
    "this gave deduced fe abundances independent of @xmath20to within the accuracy that the resulting set of log[@xmath48(fe ) ] from each of fe  i lines could be measured .",
    "hyperfine structure corrections were used for the lines of ba  ii , co  i , cu  i , mn  i , rb  i , sc  ii , and v  i. these were taken from the compilation generated by @xcite , except that the isotopic and hfs splittings for the 7800    rb  i line were taken from @xcite .",
    "non - lte corrections were not generally included , as this is a differential analysis with respect to sun , and the stellar parameters of ogle2007blg349s  are fairly close to those of the sun . two key elements for which this might be an issue are the 7770    o  i triplet and our use of the resonance doublet of k  i. we have checked the case of o using the fitting formula given in equation ( 2 ) of @xcite . when all the differences between the stellar parameters for the ogle star and the sun are taken into account",
    ", they yield a negligible difference in the non - lte correction for this o triplet .",
    "two sets of non - lte calculations are available for the k  i resonance doublet , of which we observed the redder line ; the bluer line is in the middle of a strong terrestrial absorption band .",
    "the results of the two groups , given in @xcite and in @xcite , are consistent and suggest that for solar metallicity the k abundance of the ogle star with respect to the sun from a lte analysis should be increased by about 0.08  dex to take into account the probable difference in the non - lte correction for this line .",
    "this has been implemented here .",
    "however this adopted value must be regarded as still uncertain since the non - lte corrections for k are metallicity sensitive , and none are available for super - solar metallicity .",
    "the final deduced abundances for ogle2007blg349s  for 28 species of 26 elements are given in table  [ table_abunds ] .",
    "our derived absolute abundances , the abundances relative to the sun , and the abundance ratios [ x / fe ] are given in this table .",
    "the abundance ratios use either fe  i or fe  ii as the reference depending on the ionization state and mean excitation potential of the measured lines of species under consideration . the 1@xmath31 dispersion around the mean for each species",
    "is given as @xmath49 .",
    "this is calculated from the set of differences between the deduced solar abundance for the species in question and that found for ogle2007blg349s  for each observed line of the species .",
    "thus neither random nor systematic errors in the @xmath46 values contribute to @xmath49 .",
    "while the absolute abundance for a given species listed in table  [ table_abunds ] will be affected by any systematic error in the @xmath46 values of the lines we use here , relative abundances [ x / fe ] will not since we have carried out a differential analysis with respect to the sun . an uncertainty for [ x / fe ] for each species , @xmath50 ,",
    "is calculated summing five terms combined in quadrature representing a change in @xmath0  of 100  k , the corresponding uncertainty in log(@xmath33)of 0.2  dex , a change in @xmath47 of 0.2  km  s@xmath45 , and a potential 0.25  dex mismatch between [ fe / h ] of ogle2007blg349s  versus the value + 0.5  dex of the model atmospheres we are using .",
    "the fifth term , the contribution for errors in @xmath20 , is set to 0.05  dex if only one or two lines were measured ; for a larger number of detected lines we adopt @xmath51 for this term .",
    "this is added in quadrature to the other four terms .",
    "uncertainties in the absolute abundances have only been calculated for fe as inferred from fe  i and from fe  ii lines and are given below .",
    "the sensitivity of the deduced abundances to changes in the stellar parameters or in @xmath47 is shown in table  [ table_sens_abs ] for absolute abundances and in table  [ table_sens_rel ] for relative abundances [ x / fe ] . as expected ,",
    "the latter show much weaker dependences on the choice of stellar parameters etc .",
    "these entries were used to generate the values of @xmath50 in the last column of table  [ table_abunds ] .",
    "table  [ table_sens_abs ] shows that the fe  i abundance log@xmath52 $ ] is almost independent of the choice of @xmath0 , increasing by only + 0.12  dex when @xmath0  is increased by 250  k. the neutral species of elements with resonance or low - excitation lines ( k  i , v  i , rb  i , and zr  i ) show the largest increase in deduced abundance when @xmath0  is increased , while those species with only high excitation lines ( the near - ir o triplet , c  i , and s  i ) show the opposite dependence on @xmath0 , as expected .",
    "the ionization equilibrium for fe for the adopted @xmath0  and log(@xmath33 )  is good , as is the fe  i excitation equilibrium .",
    "in addition to presenting what we believe to be the first abundance determinations for rb and for zr for any star in the galactic bulge , there are three key results of the detailed abundance analysis we have carried out of ogle2007blg349s .",
    "the first is the very high metallicity we derive .",
    "we find [ fe / h ] is @xmath6  dex from 135 fe  i lines and @xmath53  dex from 11 fe  ii lines . to achieve a reduction of [ fe / h ] to @xmath54  dex , @xmath0",
    "must be reduced to @xmath55  k , with a change of log(@xmath33 )  of + 0.2  dex for the dwarf or @xmath560.1  dex for the subgiant , for the star to lie on the appropriate isochrone . the fe ionization equilibrium",
    "will then be altered by 0.3  dex for the dwarf case and by somewhat less for the subgiant .",
    "this will produce a fe ionization equilibrium that is so far from equality that the altered set of stellar parameters must be rejected . to achieve solar metallicity and reasonable fe ionization equilibrium",
    "is simply not possible with any set of stellar parameters that lie on the relevant isochrone .",
    "second the @xmath7-elements o and mg do not show any excess with respect to fe ; oxygen , which is the most abundant @xmath7-element , has sub - solar [ o / fe ] .",
    "finally , in all species for which the abundance is regarded as well determined ( the notes in the last column of table  [ table_abunds ] indicate the major concerns ) , there are no credible deviations from the solar ratios .",
    "we note that [ fe / h ] can not be affected by mixing of nuclear processed material from the interior of a dwarf or a red giant as none would have been produced up to that stage of stellar evolution .",
    "furthermore , any diffusion of fe into the more quiescent dwarf as compared to the stirred up outer layers of the giant would be small in such high metallicity stars and would only make the present conundrum of the unexpectedly high [ fe / h ] we find in ogle2007blg349s   worse .",
    "we also note that the three line ratios we used as one method for determining @xmath0   detailed in  [ section_params ] each consisted of a v  i line paired with either a fe  i , ni  i or si  i line .",
    "we find [ v / fe ] for ogle2007blg349s  to be + 0.17@xmath57  dex ( table  [ table_abunds ] ) .",
    "if this ratio is actually slightly above solar , a slight underestimate of @xmath0  would result from the line ratio method .",
    "underestimating @xmath0  is equivalent to underestimating [ fe / h ] , which again makes the discrepancy with the bulge giants worse .",
    "an early attempt to determine the metallicity distribution in the galactic bulge was that of @xcite , who used low resolution spectroscopy for 268 bulge giants and red clump stars to derive a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath58  dex .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of m giants in the near - ir ; they found a very similar mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath59  dex with a dispersion of 0.30  dex .",
    "@xcite used extensive optical and near - ir photometry with cmd fitting ; they derived a somewhat lower mean [ fe / h ] .",
    "in all these cases , the calibration of the metallicity scale relied on galactic globular clusters .",
    "@xcite suggest that the differences between several of these studies depend crucially on the abundances adopted for the two highest metallicity gcs with high resolution abundance analyses , ngc  6553 and ngc  6558 .",
    "[ fe / h ] values for these two gcs have ranged over more than 0.5  dex in the literature , but since the work of @xcite and @xcite , who suggested values higher than most previous studies , more recent analyses have settled toward the higher values , see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an early high dispersion spectroscopic study of galactic bulge k giants is that of @xcite , who found a mean [ fe / h ] in their sample of @xmath60  dex .",
    "@xcite updates and expands upon this earlier work .",
    "they then use their detailed abundance analyses of 27 k giants in baade s window to recalibrate the metallicities for the much larger samples of @xcite and of @xcite .",
    "the mean [ fe / h ] they thus deduce is @xmath61  dex .",
    "the median [ fe / h ] of their sample is also sub - solar . as infrared echelle spectrographs",
    "have become available on 8-m class telescopes , high dispersion studies of galactic bulge giants in the near - ir have become possible , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the median fe - metallicity of the small sample of giants with near - ir spectra analyzed by @xcite is also slightly below solar metallicity . since this sample largely overlaps that of @xcite it is not included in the figures .",
    "very recently , @xcite have presented initial results of a survey of fe - metallicity in the galactic bulge from spectra with @xmath63 of about 800 stars .",
    "they find a radial gradient in [ fe / h ] within the bulge with the mean value going from + 0.03  dex at @xmath64 to @xmath65  dex at @xmath66 , and a sharp cutoff towards higher metallicities .",
    "all of these samples of galactic bulge stars are of luminous giants and/or of red clump stars .",
    "they all have mean and median [ fe / h ] values that are slightly sub - solar and are similar to the mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath67  dex found for local disk stars by @xcite . yet",
    "ogle2007blg349s , analyzed here , and ogle2006blg265s  @xcite , another galactic bulge microlensed dwarf with a high quality detailed abundance analysis , both have [ fe / h ] @xmath68  dex ; the third such star found to date , moa2006blg099s with a lower signal - to - noise ratio spectrum , analyzed by @xcite , has a somewhat lower fe - metallicity , [ fe / h ] = @xmath69  dex .",
    "the comparison between the [ fe / h ] distribution for the recalibrated sample of @xcite by @xcite and the [ fe / h ] values deduced for these three galactic bulge dwarfs is shown in figure  [ figure_feh_hist ] . while three stars is an uncomfortably small sample , it is difficult to believe that this is consistent with the published metallicity distributions for the galactic bulge giants and/or red clump stars .",
    "the probability that the sample of three stars would have such high [ fe / h ] values by chance is less than 1% given the [ fe / h ] distributions of the larger of the relevant studies in the galactic bulge claiming to have unbiased samples , including @xcite with 110 m giants , which must be considered unbiased at the high metallicity end , @xcite ( 268 bulge stars ) , and the recalibrated verion of the latter by @xcite .",
    "a ks test shows that the probability of finding the three carefully studied microlensed bulge dwarfs at their very high [ fe / h ] values if the underlying metallicity distribution is that found by @xcite from high dispersion spectra of a very large sample of giants in three bulge fields is less than 10@xmath70 .",
    "this calculation takes into account the radial gradient in the metallicity distribution function found by @xcite .",
    "we next assemble the evidence that ogle2007blg349s  is actually a dwarf in the galactic bulge .",
    "we have already demonstrated that the microlensed bulge dwarf studied here has stellar parameters that , when combined with the unlensed magnitude from the mirolensing light curve , yield an unlensed luminosity consistent with that expected for a dwarf of its @xmath0  at the distance of the galactic center .",
    "this is true to within 0.2  mag for the other two such stars as well ogle2006blg265s  and moa2006blg099s@xcite .",
    "the three microlensed bulge dwarfs studied to date come from a kinematically hot population ; they have radial velocities of + 99 , @xmath56154 and + 113 km  s@xmath45  with a typical uncertainty of less than 2  km  s@xmath45 , thus showing a dispersion in @xmath43 consistent with that inferred from large samples of bulge giants ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    about 4% of the dwarfs in the solar neighborhood from the proper motion sample of @xcite",

    "these stars are almost all on eccentric orbits with small pericenters ( @xmath72  kpc ) . @xcite and @xcite have carried out detailed abundance analyses of some of these stars to find that the most metal rich of them reach [ fe / h ] + 0.55  dex , and have solar abundance ratios in general .",
    "these local dwarfs are thus similar in their abundances to ogle2007blg349s .",
    "the references cited suggest that they are possibly stars on chaotic orbits ejected from the galactic bar or older central regions of the galactic disk .",
    "little is known about the inner regions of the galactic disk , whether it exists at all in the inner kpc , what its scale height might be should it exist , etc .",
    "the model of @xcite , constructed to reproduce the surface brightness within 5  kpc of the galactic center seen by cobe / dirbe at 3.5 and at 4.9  @xmath14 after correction for extinction , suggests a double exponential disk with a scale heights of 42 and of 210  pc ( 1.5@xmath13 at a distance of 8  kpc to the galactic center ) combined with a truncated power - law bulge . however , the beam size of cobe / dirbe is @xmath73 , and this was smoothed to a 1.5@xmath13 angular resolution for their analysis .",
    "the scale height of 210  pc thus corresponds to their minimum angular resolution , and may well be smaller , which would reduce any potential disk contamination of bulge samples . in any case , using their model as a guide , we find that the probability of contamination by disk stars of a sample at @xmath74 in this maximal case is only @xmath3530% larger than it is at @xmath75 .",
    "some disk models such as model 2 of @xcite , constructed to fit 2mass star counts , contain an inner hole , which would lower potential disk contamination of bulge samples substantially .    rather than speculate further on whether or not there is a disk within the central kpc and what its properties might be , we refer back to the large samples of `` bulge '' giants studied in the many references cited above .",
    "the innermost field included in most of these is baade s window , with @xmath76 ranging from @xmath77 to @xmath78 .",
    "the galactic latitudes for the three microlensed dwarfs are @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , so that two of these are slightly smaller than that of baade s window . however",
    ", recently @xcite presented a detailed abundance analysis from near - ir spectra of m giants in a field at ( @xmath82 ) = ( @xmath83 ) , significantly closer to the galactic center than any of the three microlensed dwarfs .",
    "their sample of 17 m giants has the usual properties seen in the baade s window samples , a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath84  dex , with the most metal rich at [ fe / h ] @xmath85  dex .",
    "these giants show the usual @xmath7-enhancement .",
    "surely the microlensed dwarfs , each located more than twice as high above the galactic plane than the giants in this inner bulge field , then can not be from a different population than the @xcite m giant sample ; we thus do not believe that the sample of microlensed bulge stars is contaminated by any disk stars that might be co - located near the galactic center .",
    "we suggest that sample bias is responsible for the difference between the median fe - metallicity seen in the bulge giant samples and that of the microlensed bulge dwarfs .",
    "a possible mechanism is the very high mass loss rates predicted to occur at the very high metallicities and moderately high luminosities being discussed here .",
    "these are high enough that in an old stellar population , stars are predicted to lose enough mass to peel off the red giant branch ( rgb ) before reaching the he - flash , which they never go through .",
    "red clump stars , which are burning he in their cores on the horizontal branch , are even more evolved than giants at the rgb tip , and so their evolutionary tracks , once mass loss is properly taken into account , may indicate that their expected numbers in an old very - metal rich population may be even more depleted than are luminous first ascent rgb stars .",
    "this effect may have been detected through cmd studies of the extremely metal - rich open cluster ngc  6791 with [ fe / h ] + 0.45  dex @xcite . in this cluster",
    ", @xcite found a strong relative absence of luminous rgb stars .",
    "we propose that this relative paucity of giants on the upper rgb for very metal - rich old populations produces a bias against the highest metallicity stars by preferentially eliminating them from the samples being studied by all previous investigations in the galactic bulge , which samples consist of one or more of the luminous k giants , luminous m giants , and red clump stars found there .",
    "if this is correct , then the mean bulge metallicity may be comparable to that expected from the radial gradients prevailing within the galactic disk at a time @xmath355  gyr ago extrapolated to the galactic center .",
    "it thus may be that at the present time there is a gradient within the solar circle of stellar metallicity with galactic radius that is roughly comparable to that measured for the interstellar medium ( ism ) at present from hii regions by @xcite and from planetary nebulae ( pn ) by @xcite .",
    "the latter present an estimate of the change of the radial abundance gradient in the galaxy as a function of time from pn of varying ages .",
    "they suggest that the radial abundance gradient in the ism in the galactic disk was twice as large @xmath355  gyr ago when the sun was formed than it is now",
    ".    there are important consequences for the chemical evolution of extragalactic objects as well if our conjecture regarding the metallicity distribution of the galactic bulge is correct .",
    "the interpretation of spectra and broad band photometry of the integrated light of simple old metal - rich stellar populations such as are believed to exist in luminous elliptical galaxies may be affected .",
    "we expect an underestimate of the true fe - metallicity of such systems to occur with commonly used tools such as lick indices , calculated with stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones that ignore mass loss , as is normally the case .",
    "we expect an overestimate of the mass - to - light ratio to occur if the luminous rgb stars we expect to be present near the rgb tip in a metal - rich population are not present in their expected numbers as they contribute only a small fraction of the mass , but a larger fraction of the total luminosity .",
    "changes in the strength of specific absorption features can be expected as well , particularly in the ir , where luminous red giants dominate the integrated light assuming they are present .",
    "many previous analyses of galactic bulge k and m giants have found enhanced @xmath7/fe ratios when compared to both the thick and thin disk stars for which very accurate abundance ratios for many elements for large samples exist , see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "abundance ratios help illuminate the star formation history of the bulge , and the contributions to its chemical inventory as a function of time of snia , snii , and agb stars .",
    "the @xmath7-enhancement found in galactic bulge giants has been viewed as an indication that chemical evolution proceeded more rapidly in the galactic bulge than in either the galactic thick or thin disk population . in particular ,",
    "@xcite discuss the role of o and mg as probes of the contribution of massive stars ; see @xcite for a current model .",
    "@xcite revisit this issue , suggesting that metallicity dependent mass loss rates or nucleosynthesis yields may be important in this context .",
    "such findings help to determine the mode of formation of the galactic bulge , whether it is a classical bulge or one formed over a longer timescale through secular evolution of the disk .",
    "detailed discussion of these options and references to the relevant theoretical studies can be found in e.g. , @xcite .    rapidly increasing samples of luminous stars in the bulge , both in terms of numbers of stars analyzed and in terms of the accuracy of the results , are now becoming available .",
    "@xcite gives a detailed discussion of @xmath7-enhancement in their sample of galactic bulge k giants .",
    "they find enhanced [ o / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] and [ al / fe ] compared both to the solar ratios and to those in both thick and thin disk stars even in super - solar bulge k giants and discuss the different behavior of the hydrostatic ( including o and mg ) and explosive ( including si , ca and ti ) @xmath7 elements ; only the former appear enhanced in the bulge giants .",
    "recently initial results from a major high dispersion spectroscopic survey of galactic bulge giants and red clump stars being carried out at the vlt have been reported by @xcite with more details in @xcite .",
    "they present the analysis of a sample of 53 stars selected to span the color range of bulge giants .",
    "however , our analysis of ogle2007blg349s  ( see table  [ table_abunds ] ) finds [ mg / fe ] has the solar ratio and [ o / fe ] is subsolar .",
    "@xcite find similar low ratios in ogle2006blg265s .",
    "the third microlensed star , moa2006blg099s , shows a small @xmath7-enhancement , but the uncertainties are large , and a @xmath86 deviation toward smaller values would make them consistent with the solar values .",
    "subsolar [ o / fe ] is found in all three microlensed dwarfs .",
    "figure  [ figure_two_ogle ] shows the abundance ratios [ x / fe ] for each species detected in one of both of the two bulge dwarfs with [ fe / h ] @xmath68  dex .",
    "figures  [ figure_abund_ratios1 ] and [ figure_abund_ratios2 ] display the abundance ratios for the three microlensed galactic bulge dwarfs for several elements as a function of [ fe / h ] as compared to recent results from samples of luminous galactic bulge giants .",
    "a comparison of [ mg / fe ] with [ al / fe ] for the two microlensed bulge dwarfs compared to the results from the samples of bulge giants of @xcite and of @xcite is shown in figure  [ figure_mgal ] .",
    "the three microlensed bulge dwarfs lie at the low end of the distribution in [ mg / fe ] and at the extreme low end of that for [ al / fe ] . also intriguing",
    "is that @xcite finds evidence for variations among the giants of highest metallicity in their sample of [ o / fe ] , [ na / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] and [ al / fe ] that substantially exceed their claimed uncertainties .",
    "this is accompanied by an anti - correlation between [ o / fe ] and [ na / fe ] and by a correlation of [ na / fe ] with [ al / fe ] , very reminiscent of the star - to - star abundance variations found within galactic globular clusters , as summarized in the recent review of @xcite .    as is shown in figs .",
    "[ figure_abund_ratios1 ] and [ figure_abund_ratios2 ] , the microlensed dwarfs show no sign of @xmath7-enhancement , while the bulge giants have [ mg / fe ] ( as well as [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] ) enhanced even at super - solar metallicities . what is causing this difference ?",
    "why do the giants show a such large range in [ x / fe ] for several key light elements ?",
    "are the giants mixed ?",
    "are there substantial non - lte corrections which are not being included correctly ?",
    "the key question is which of the two , bulge giants or microlensed bulge dwarfs , best represents in its atmosphere today the initial chemical inventory of the star , i.e. , of the interstellar medium at the time that the star was formed .",
    "it must be noted that the study of microlensed galactic dwarfs can be carried out differentially with respect to the sun , as we did here , while those of cool giants are forced to rely on arcturus and/or @xmath14  leo as the reference .",
    "this difference may give rise to potentially substantial systematic errors in the analysis which may depend on @xmath0  of the star .",
    "a probable example of such a systematic error can be seen in the [ si / fe ] panel of figure  3 of @xcite , where this abundance ratio , inferred in every star from the same line of si  i , at 3905   , changes systematically from about + 0.7 to 0.0  dex as @xmath0  increases from 5000 to 6500  k for a sample of very metal - poor rhb stars and red giants .",
    "presumably [ si / fe ] is approximately the same for all the stars included in this figure , but some unrecognized systematic error has crept into the analyses so as to produce the strong trend they found for [ si / fe ] with @xmath0 .",
    "it must be recognized , however , that the recent analyses of bulge k and m giants have been carried out by several independent groups each of which contains highly experienced experts in this field .",
    "we therefore look for an explanation that allows both sets of deduced abundance ratios , those of the bulge giants and those found here for ogle2007blg349s  as well as for the other two well studied microlensed bulge dwarfs , to be correct .",
    "dredge up and mixing in the giants is a possible culprit , particularly since @xcite found a large range in [ o / fe ] , [ na / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] and [ al / fe ] among the most fe - rich stars in their large sample of bulge giants .",
    "however , at least in the globular cluster case at low [ fe / h ] , one sees c burning into n , and sometimes o burning into n as well @xcite , occasionally with depleted mg and enhanced al .",
    "the signature of proton burning via the cn cycle , clearly seen in the globular cluster giants , is not apparent in the bulge giants .",
    "for this ( and other ) reasons , @xcite rejected mixing as the explanation for the large range they saw in in some abundance ratios .",
    "if larger samples of microlensed galactic bulge dwarfs continue to show solar ratios of [ mg / fe ] and [ al / fe ] while samples of bulge giants show in the mean much higher values for each of these elements coupled with a large range for each , even at super - solar metallicity , we would suggest that the true initial abundance ratios for the light elements , including the @xmath7-elements , at high [ fe / h ] in the galactic bulge are those of the dwarfs , not the giants .",
    "we have analyzed a high dispersion spectrum of a microlensed dwarf , ogle2007blg349s , in the galactic bulge .",
    "the magnification of this event was very high , hires on the 10-m keck  i telescope was used , the weather was clear with good seeing , and the exposure time was long compared to any previous such data , so the resulting spectrum has a relatively high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we stress that in principle the abundance analysis of a upper main sequence dwarf is much easier and less prone to error for spectra of a fixed signal - to - noise ratio than that of a much cooler but much brighter bulge giant with a very complex spectrum full of blends and of strong molecular bands .",
    "the advantages of analyzing microlensed bulge stars , for which the required high signal - to - noise ratio can sometimes be achieved , to improving our understanding of the [ fe / h ] distribution and chemical evolution of the galactic bulge are large .",
    "we have derived for ogle2007blg349s , which we believe to be a dwarf below the main sequence turnoff with @xmath0@xmath1  k , a very high fe - metallicity , [ fe / h ] = @xmath6  dex .",
    "this is very peculiar given that many previous surveys of the metallicity distribution carried out with large samples of k or m giants in the galactic bulge find both the mean and median [ fe / h ] to be sub - solar .",
    "the two other highly magnified galactic bulge dwarfs studied in detail , ogle2006blg265sby @xcite and moa2006blg099s  by @xcite , also have very high fe - metallicities .    in order to produce consistency",
    ", we suggest that there is a sampling bias in the bulge giant samples such that very metal - rich giants are strongly depleted .",
    "we suggest a physical mechanism for this , the very high mass loss rates expected for such metal - rich old giants can exhaust their envelopes prior to the normal he - flash .",
    "we also find that ogle2007blg349s  does not show enhancements of the @xmath7 elements ; neither does ogle2006blg265s , analyzed by @xcite",
    ". however , most bulge giants from samples with high dispersion spectroscopy , e.g. the work of @xcite and particularly those from @xcite , do show large ( and varying from star to star ) enhancements of [ na / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] and [ al / fe ] even at super - solar metallicities .",
    "we suggest that it is the abundances deduced for the microlensed dwarfs that best represent the initial chemical inventory of the interstellar medium at the time these stars formed , while those derived for the bulge giants may not .",
    "we recognize that three stars is a very small sample , but the implications of our results and inferences for the chemical evolution of the galactic bulge and for the interpretation of integrated light spectra and broad - band photometry of old simple stellar populations such as luminous ellitical galaxies , are so important that we offer these hypotheses at this time .",
    "the study of additional highly microlensed galactic bulge dwarfs to increase the sample from just three such stars is clearly urgent . now",
    "that ongoing microlensing surveys make such observations of galactic bulge dwarfs feasible , we expect substantial improvements in the sample size of high quality spectra for galactic bulge dwarfs .",
    "suitable high magnification events are rare and lining up the necessary instruments / telescopes / clear weather at just the right time is difficult .",
    "several years may be required to accumulate a suitable sample of spectra of highly microlensed dwarf stars in the galactic bulge .",
    "we are now appropriately positioned to carry out such a time critical program at the keck observatory over the next few years , and eagerly look forward to confirmation of our perhaps premature and provocative hypotheses in the not too distant future .",
    "we are grateful to the many people who have worked to make the keck telescope and hires a reality and to operate and maintain the keck observatory .",
    "the authors wish to extend special thanks to those of hawaiian ancestry on whose sacred mountain we are privileged to be guests . without their generous hospitality , none of the observations presented herein would have been possible .",

    "we thank manuela zoccali for providing results in advance of publication on the metallicity distribution function of bulge giants .",
    "the origin of the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) has been a puzzle for more than 30 years ; see , e.g. , the review by @xcite .",
    "most stars previously studied with high reddening are hot luminous young stars within a cluster embedded in a single cloud complex whose column density varies somewhat over the angular extent of the cloud , such as the iv cyg association .",
    "but the reddening seen for ogle2007blg349s  ( @xmath87  mag ) , while not particularly large , results from the many clouds along the line of sight to the galactic center , and hence is much more representative of the typical ism . very little , if any , of this reddening is believed to arise arise within the galactic bulge itself .    because ogle2007blg349s  is a metal - rich cool dwarf , rather than an o or b star which would is normally used for such work , measurements of the dibs are difficult and the results more uncertain than would arise for a much less complex hot star spectrum .",
    "the very strong and blended stellar absorption features in the blue part of the spectrum made a clear detection of the classical dib at 4430    impossible .",
    "parameters for those interstellar bands that could be detected with certainty are given in table  [ table_dib ] .",
    "they are comparable in strength with those observed for the well studied b7 supergiant hd  183143 whose values are given in table  a1 of @xcite even though the reddening of this bright star is @xmath88  mag , about twice as large as that of ogle2007blg349s .",
    "@xcite have shown that the band strength per grain in the line of sight apparently decreases with increasing grain size , such that dense interstellar clouds are less efficient in producing absorption by dibs for the same total reddening than are less dense , but more numerous clouds in the line of sight . the very strong dibs and immense interstellar absorption in the nad lines in our spectrum of ogle2007blg349s",

    "<S> this bulge star is highly enhanced in metallicity with [ fe / h ]   @xmath2 , and that log@xmath3 ~   \\equiv ~ log_{10 } ( n_a / n_h ) + 12.00 $ ] , for elements @xmath4 and @xmath5 . ] </S>",

    "<S> the abundance ratios for the 28 species of 26 elements for which features could be detected in the spectra are almost all solar . in particular , there is no evidence for enhancement of any of the @xmath7-elements including o and mg . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the high [ fe / h ] seen in this star , when combined with the equally high [ fe / h ] derived in previous detailed abundance analysis of two other galactic bulge dwarfs , both also highly magnified by microlensing , implies that the median metallicity in the galactic bulge is very high . </S>",
    "<S> we thus infer that many previous estimates of the metallicity distribution in the galactic bulge have substantially underestimated the mean fe - metallicity there due to sample bias , and suggest a candidate mechanism for such . if our conjecture proves valid , it may be necessary to update the calibrations for the algorithms used by many groups to interpret spectra and broad band photometry of the integrated light of very metal - rich old stellar populations , including luminous elliptical galaxies . </S>"
