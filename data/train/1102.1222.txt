    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulation is a powerful tool for investigating thermodynamic properties of classical spin models  @xcite . the standard single - spin flip algorithm is widely used because it is simple and applicable to systems with any type of interactions .",
    "however , it is well known that it suffers from slow relaxation in many cases . for example , the single - spin - flip dynamics exhibits critical slowing down near a continuous transition temperature where the correlation length diverges .",
    "such difficulty is avoided by using a nonlocal , global update , such as the swendsen - wang cluster algorithm for ising systems  @xcite or its wolff s extension to heisenberg systems  @xcite .",
    "these cluster algorithms accelerate the relaxation by flipping many spins at once , i.e. , updating the spin configuration drastically .",
    "besides the critical slowing down , the single - spin flip algorithm often suffers from dynamical freezing at low temperature ( @xmath1 ) when the ground state has macroscopic degeneracy under the influence of geometrical frustration .",
    "a typical example is an antiferromagnetic ising model on a pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the pyrochlore lattice is a three - dimensional frustrated structure given by a corner - sharing network of tetrahedra , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) .",
    "when the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction is limited to nearest - neighbor sites , no long - range ordering occurs down to zero @xmath1 and the ground state has macroscopic degeneracy  @xcite .",
    "the degenerate manifold is identified by a collection of local constraints enforcing two spins pointing up and two spins pointing down in every tetrahedron , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) .",
    "this ` two - up two - down ' constraint is called the ice rule because of an analogy to the constraint on positions of protons in hexagonal ice  @xcite .",
    "similar situation was recently discovered in the so - called spin - ice systems , in which the ising - like spins point along the local @xmath2 axes and interact with each other by ferromagnetic exchange interaction and dipole interaction  @xcite . because the degenerate ` ice - rule ' configurations are separated by large energy barriers of the order of the dominant interaction scale @xmath3 , the single - spin flip does not work at low @xmath4 .",
    "the difficulty is avoided by introducing a global flip called the loop flip , in which one reverses all ising spins on a specific closed loop passing through tetrahedra  @xcite ; the loop is chosen so that the spins are up and down ( inward and outward in the spin - ice problem ) alternatively along the loop [ see the hexagon in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) as an example ] .",
    "this loop flip enables to transform an ice - rule state to another ice - rule state bypassing the energy barriers .",
    "the difficulty remains even when the ising discreteness is relaxed and spins can fluctuate , as long as the ground - state manifold retains a multivalley structure with large energy barriers .",
    "such situation is seen in variants of pyrochlore antiferromagnets , such as classical heisenberg models in the presence of the single - ion easy - axis anisotropy  @xcite and the biquadratic interaction  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the ising case , however , it is nontrivial how to define the loop with alternating spins .",
    "moreover , the loop flip procedure is not unique in the heisenberg spin case because of the continuous degrees of freedom .",
    "recently , the authors extended the loop algorithm to the heisenberg spin systems with single - ion anisotropy by defining ` colors ' of spins as black and white , which is a natural generalization of up and down in the antiferromagnetic ising case , in terms of the projection of spins on the anisotropy axis  @xcite .",
    "we tested different ways to flip spins on a formed loop and showed that the efficiency strongly depends on the method . in the models with the biquadratic interaction , however , because of the @xmath5 spin rotational symmetry , we have no explicit anisotropy axis to project spins on .",
    "therefore , an extension of the loop algorithm to this class of models is not straightforward .    in this paper",
    ", we develop an extension of the loop algorithm to classical antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin systems with biquadratic interaction in which the spin - ice type manifold emerges at low @xmath1 . we propose a way to define the projection axis for constructing loops and test three different ways to flip a formed loop .",
    "we apply the algorithm to a nearest - neighbor bilinear - biquadratic model , and compare the efficiency of the three methods .",
    "interested readers are referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for further application of the present algorithm to a bond - disordered bilinear - biquadratic model .",

    "the broken arrow @xmath6 shows a common axis selected by @xmath7 in the nematic phase .",
    "black ( filled ) circles represent spins in the direction of @xmath6 , while white ( open ) circles represent spins in the opposite direction .",
    "the spin configuration is an example of the spin - ice type states in which the ` two - up two - down ' local constraint is satisfied in every tetrahedron .",
    "the hexagon with a bold dashed line denotes one of the shortest loops on which a flip of all spins ( black and white ) transforms the ice - rule state to another ice - rule state .",

    "( 2 ) _ flip parallel _ , and ( 3 ) _ rotate_. see the text for details . ]",
    "in this section , we extend the loop algorithm to classical antiferromagnetic heisenberg models with biquadratic interactions .",
    "we start with a hamiltonian of a simple form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes a classical heisenberg spin at site @xmath10 on the pyrochlore lattice [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) ] ( we take @xmath11 ) and @xmath7 is the coupling constant of the biquadratic interaction . here",
    "we consider @xmath12 which favors collinear spin configurations .",
    "we note that such ` ferro'-type biquadratic interaction originates in the spin - lattice coupling as well as quantum and thermal fluctuations .",
    "we consider the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath13 , and take the energy unit as @xmath14 .",
    "the sum runs over the nearest - neighbor bonds of the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the following algorithm is applicable to more general spin - ice type models on other frustrated lattices with farther - neighbor or bond - dependent interactions , and site - dependent anisotropy .    when @xmath15 , the model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham - h ] ) exhibits no long - range ordering down to @xmath16 , and the ground state is given by a collection of local constraints that enforces the sum of @xmath9 to be zero in every tetrahedron .",
    "consequently , the ground - state manifold has continuous macroscopic degeneracy  @xcite . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the present model exhibits a weak first - order transition at @xmath17 to a nematic state in which spins spontaneously select a common axis @xmath6 without selecting their directions on it  @xcite .",
    "hence , the ground state for @xmath12 is identified by a collection of spin - ice type local constraints : in every tetrahedron , two out of four spins are aligned parallel to each other and the other two are antiparallel to them  ` two - up two - down ' configuration [ see fig .  [ fig:1](a ) ] .",
    "the ground - state manifold develops a multivalley structure whose minima correspond to different spin - ice - type configurations separated by large energy barriers of the order of @xmath7 and @xmath3 .      in the previous paper ,",
    "the authors developed an extension of the loop algorithm to be applicable to a family of classical heisenberg antiferromagnets with single - ion anisotropy , in which the single - spin flip algorithm suffers from slow relaxation due to the formation of the spin - ice type manifold  @xcite .",
    "in the extended loop algorithm , ( i ) we first project all the spins onto the anisotropy axis to assign black and white colors , ( ii ) next , construct a loop of alternating black and white , and ( iii ) flip all the spins on the loop .",
    "for the present bilinear - biquadratic model , a similar difficulty from slow relaxation is anticipated because the low-@xmath1 state develops the spin - ice type degeneracy as mentioned above .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to apply the extended loop algorithm since the present model retains @xmath0(3 ) spin rotational symmetry and does not have any explicit anisotropy axis to project the spins on .",
    "it is necessary to deduce the common axis @xmath6 selected by @xmath7 for each mc sample .    here , we propose the following procedure to define the projection axis .",
    "we first pick up a set of @xmath18 tetrahedra \\{@xmath19 } ( @xmath20 ) randomly from the whole system . starting from an initial guess @xmath21",
    "[ we take @xmath22 , the normalized projection axis @xmath23 is obtained iteratively by @xmath24 here the sum is taken over all spins belonging to the selected tetrahedra \\{@xmath19 } , and @xmath25 is the index of the iteration . for larger @xmath18 and @xmath26",
    ", the resultant @xmath27 gives a better approximation of @xmath6 . in practice , we take @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the following calculations for the system size with @xmath30 spins .",
    "we confirm that the loop flip is efficiently performed for these conditions , as demonstrated below . once @xmath23 is defined in this way , the step ( ii ) and ( iii ) are done in the same way as in ref .",
    "it should be noted that , to ensure the detailed balance , loops must be constructed avoiding the tetrahedra included in \\{@xmath19 } as well as defect tetrahedra in which the ice rule is violated : otherwise , the loop flip becomes irreversible because the flip changes @xmath23 .    in the extended loop algorithm ,",
    "the loop flip procedure to reverse all colors on a loop is not unique because spins can thermally fluctuate  @xcite .",
    "to choose an efficient method , careful consideration on the energy change is necessary . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors tested two different ways : ( 1 ) _ flip xyz _ and ( 2 ) _ flip parallel_. in _ flip xyz _ , all three cartesian components of @xmath9 are reversed as @xmath31 , while in _ flip parallel _ , only parallel components @xmath32 are reversed as @xmath33 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ] .",
    "the previous study revealed that , in the case of the single - ion anisotropy , only the acceptance rate for _ flip parallel _ can become one ( rejection free ) in the limit of @xmath34 ; the acceptance rate for _ flip xyz _ converges to a finite value less than unity as @xmath35 because of the effect of thermal fluctuations on the transverse component of spins  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these two updates , in this paper , we introduce another way to reverse colors , i.e. , ( 3 ) _ rotate_. in _ rotate _ , one translates every spin to the neighboring site on the loop simultaneously in the direction in which the loop was formed [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ] . in the next section",
    ", we try the three different methods and demonstrate that the most efficient method depends on the model parameter @xmath7 .",
    "in this section , we apply the extended loop algorithm to the model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham - h ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate the efficiency of loop flips in mc simulations and compare the efficiency of the three methods . in the following ,",
    "we show the mc results for the systems size with @xmath30 spins under periodic boundary conditions . to retain the ergodicity",
    ", we use the loop flip together with the single - spin flip .",
    "one mc step consists of single - spin flips , followed by loop flips with either _ flip xyz _ , _ flip parallel _ , or _",
    "rotate_. in the single - spin flips , we randomly choose a new spin state on the unit sphere for each spin following a procedure proposed by marsaglia  @xcite .    ) , the probability of formation of closed loops ( @xmath36 ) , the acceptance rates of flip of a formed loop by _ flip xyz _ ( @xmath37 ) , _ flip parallel _ ( @xmath38 ) , and _ rotate _ ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the data are calculated at ( a ) @xmath40 , ( b ) @xmath41 , ( c ) @xmath42 , and ( d ) @xmath43 .",
    "the vertical broken lines denote the nematic transition temperature @xmath44 estimated by the peak position in the specific heat ( not shown ) . ]     dependence of @xmath38 , @xmath37 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 at @xmath47 . ]",
    "[ fig:3 ]    at low @xmath1 compared to @xmath7 and @xmath3 , spin configurations are enforced to satisfy the ` two - up two - down ' ice rule , and the acceptance rate of the single - spin flip , @xmath46 , is suppressed .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . on the other hand , the probability that a closed loop is successfully formed",
    ", @xmath48 , steeply increases below the nematic transition temperature @xmath17 , indicating that almost all tetrahedra start to follow the ice rule below @xmath44 .",
    "[ for @xmath49 , the ice rule is weakly violated in the range of @xmath50 even below @xmath44 , but gradually satisfied for @xmath51 , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](d ) . ]",
    "the acceptance rate of flips of a formed loop also increases below @xmath44 and remains finite as @xmath52 ; here , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the rate for _ flip xyz _ , _ flip parallel _ , and _ rotate _ , respectively .",
    "the total acceptance rate of the loop flip is given by the product as @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for each method .",
    "hence the acceptance rate of the loop flip sharply increases at @xmath56 , compensating the decrease of @xmath46 .",
    "these @xmath1 dependences are qualitatively the same for the wide range of @xmath7 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "as demonstrated in the previous study for the models with single - ion anisotropy  @xcite , the efficiency of the loop flip at low @xmath1 depends on the method .",
    "furthermore , in the present case with the biquadratic interaction @xmath7 , the efficiency at low @xmath1 strongly depends on @xmath7 . the result",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . for small @xmath57 ,",
    "_ flip parallel _ is most efficient , while it is taken over by _ rotate _ in the intermediate range of @xmath58 , and finally by _",
    "flip xyz _ for @xmath59 .",
    "the difference of the efficiency is understood by the following consideration on the energy change by the flips . considering a given state at a finite @xmath1 well below @xmath44 , its energy measured from the ground - state energy",
    "is given by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the energies corresponding to the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham - h ] ) , respectively . both @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "are of the order of @xmath1 at low @xmath1 .",
    "the three loop flips change the two contributions in different ways .",
    "changes @xmath61 by a certain fraction @xmath63 but conserves @xmath62 .",
    "meanwhile , _ flip parallel _ and _ rotate _ change both of @xmath61 and @xmath62 by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "first we consider the large @xmath7 limit , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for",
    "_ flip xyz _ in which @xmath67 , we obtain @xmath68 as @xmath69 .",
    "since the acceptance rate is given by @xmath70 , this consideration gives @xmath71 , that is , _ flip xyz _ becomes rejection free as @xmath72 .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . on the contrary ,",
    "_ flip parallel _ and _ rotate _ can not become rejection free for @xmath69 because they change @xmath62 by @xmath73 ; @xmath74 and @xmath39 converge to finite values less than unity at @xmath75 , respectively . note that _ rotate _ does not change a half of the nearest - neighbor bond energies .",
    "this may account for why @xmath76 at @xmath77 .    for smaller @xmath7 ,",
    "spins deviate from the common axis @xmath6 with larger angle . considering that @xmath6 is set by @xmath78 and @xmath62",
    "is proportional to @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is a typical deviation angle ) , we obtain @xmath81 for @xmath82  @xcite . since _ flip parallel _",
    "changes @xmath61 and @xmath62 by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively  @xcite , we obtain @xmath85 at low @xmath86 for _ flip parallel_. this indicates that @xmath74 does not vanish even at @xmath87 in the nematic phase .",
    "meanwhile , the other two methods change the energy as @xmath88 at low @xmath1 and @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that their acceptance rates vanish as @xmath87 in contrast to _",
    "flip parallel_. therefore , _ flip parallel _ becomes most efficient at @xmath87 .",
    "these considerations are consistent with the numerical results shown in fig .  3 .",
    "in the intermediate regime , i.e , @xmath89 , _ rotate _ is superior to the other two , presumably because of a remnant of the advantage of _ rotate _ over _ flip parallel _ at @xmath69 .",
