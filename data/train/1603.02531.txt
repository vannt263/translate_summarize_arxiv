    "the modern treatment of the @xmath3 interactions at low energies is based on chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath4pt ) , an effective field theory @xcite that implements the qcd symmetries in the region of the large strong coupling constant .",
    "originally , @xmath4pt was designed to treat the strong interactions between mesons , the goldstone bosons of the theory .",
    "later on , it was extended to the meson - baryon sector , see refs .",
    "@xcite for initial works .",
    "the power counting issues arising from the large nucleon mass in the chiral limit were overcome by various methods , for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite . using baryon @xmath4pt ,",
    "the @xmath3 interaction was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the standard perturbation series does not converge due to strong coupling of @xmath3 to the @xmath5 channel and due to an existence of the @xmath2 resonance below the @xmath3 threshold ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the problem was overcome with an introduction of effective pseudo - potentials constructed to match the chiral amplitudes in the born approximation . within this quantum - mechanical approach ,",
    "the use of multi - channel techniques and lippmann - schwinger equation then allows to sum properly a presumably dominant part of the full perturbation series .",
    "another way of dealing with the divergences was adopted in @xcite where the intermediate state green function was regularized by means of a momentum cutoff .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also argued in favor of neglecting off - shell effects inherent in the separable model of ref .",
    "@xcite and introduced channels closed at the @xmath3 threshold to improve description of experimental data . finally , the chiral approach to @xmath3 interactions was reformulated within a complete quantum field methodology based on dispersion relation for the inverse of the scattering matrix where dimensional regularization was used to tame the infinities of the meson - baryon green function  @xcite . in such an approach unitarity",
    "is preserved at each order of the chiral expansion of the potential @xcite . for latter use , the approach is often referred to as the chiral unitary model .",
    "it was also shown how one can match the so - constructed non - perturbative amplitudes to the @xmath4pt amplitudes beyond leading order .    in a broad region around the @xmath3 threshold",
    "the energy and density dependence of the isoscalar part of the @xmath3 amplitude is strongly influenced by the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "while the @xmath2 properties have been well known for a long time , the nature of the resonance retains some unresolved mysteries . at present",
    ", the @xmath2 appears to be dynamically generated , see e.g.  the study of compositeness in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the situation is complicated by the appearance of two close - by poles .",
    "the reader is also referred to the in - depth review by hyodo and jido @xcite as well as to a very recent review in the pdg tables  @xcite .",
    "the chiral approaches that implement the strong coupling of the @xmath6 and @xmath3 channels lead to two dynamically generated resonances assigned to the @xmath2 , each of them coupling individually to the @xmath3 and @xmath5 states @xcite .",
    "although the theoretical models give different predictions for exact positions of the poles it seems that the very recent experimental measurements of the kaonic hydrogen characteristics by the siddharta collaboration @xcite based on the improved deser - type formula @xcite combined with an analysis of the @xmath6 mass spectra observed in photoproduction experiments by the clas collaboration @xcite help to fix at least the position of the pole at higher energy that couples more strongly to the @xmath3 channel .",
    "particularly , the clas data may be used to choose among a number of local minima emerging in @xmath7 fits with many free parameters introduced when next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections are accounted for in the meson - baryon interactions @xcite .    in the present work we look at another aspect of the theory , the origin of the poles generated by the multi - channel dynamics .",
    "it was already shown by hyodo and weise @xcite that one of the @xmath2 related states transforms into a @xmath5 resonance and the other one into a @xmath3 bound state when the inter - channel couplings are switched off . in the current work we elaborate on this finding within a more general concept , discuss the conditions under which such poles emerge and display the pole content of several different models , all of them reproducing the same experimental data . by requiring an existence of a pole in a particular channel",
    "we get additional restrictions on the values of some parameters that are fitted to the experimental data .",
    "we also maintain that only a limited number of poles can be generated dynamically within the coupled channels framework with interactions driven by chiral symmetry .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the chiral unitary approach to meson - baryon interactions and specify the models used in our analysis .",
    "then , we compare the predictions of the models for the energy dependence of the @xmath3 amplitude as well as for the isoscalar poles assigned to the @xmath8(1405 ) resonance .",
    "further , in section  [ sec : poles ] we derive conditions on pole existence in a limit of switched - off inter - channel couplings and continue with a discussion of the pole contents of the selected models .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper with a summary .",
    "in our analysis we focus on @xmath3 interactions described within a framework of coupled channels approaches with inter - channel couplings derived from an effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "the channels involve all meson - baryon states built up from the corresponding ground state octets with the total strangeness @xmath9 . in order of the corresponding production threshold energies these are : @xmath10 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with appropriate charges ( or isospins ) . in terms of threshold energies",
    "these channels encompass a broad interval from 1250  mev to about 1800  mev .",
    "however , it should be noted that we restrict ourselves to two - body channels in @xmath14-wave only , so that any effects due to a formation of additional particles are neglected in the approaches discussed here .",
    "additionally , since the model parameters are fitted to experimental data available at the @xmath0 threshold and at low kaon momenta it is clear that the models may lack a predictive power at energies far from the @xmath3 threshold .",
    "however , for the study of the qualitative features related to dynamically generated resonances and to the su(3 ) symmetry of the chiral interactions such approach is perfectly suited .    in the following",
    "we will outline the theoretical approaches used in the present work .",
    "we will concentrate on the most important features of these , referring the interested reader to the original publications for more details .",
    "all models considered here describe ( at least ) the available total cross sections @xmath15 at low energies , see refs .",
    "@xcite , the old but very precise threshold branching ratios @xmath16 from refs .",
    "@xcite , as well as the energy shift and width due to strong interaction measured for the 1s level of the kaonic hydrogen in the siddharta experiment at da@xmath17ne @xcite .",
    "besides that , some of the considered models included additional experimental data to constrain a relatively large parameter space as we specify below .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the starting point of all considered approaches is the meson - baryon potential derived from the chiral lagrangian , which at the leading chiral order reads @xmath18_+",

    "the traceless meson matrix @xmath22 , included in the above lagrangian via @xmath23 and @xmath24 , collects the goldstone bosons of the theory , i.e. @xmath25 . the ground state octet of baryons ( @xmath26 ) is included via the traceless matrix @xmath27 .",
    "all external currents are set to zero except the scalar one , which reflects the explicit chiral symmetry breaking and is set equal to the quark mass matrix @xmath28 .",
    "note , however , that in @xmath4pt the quark masses always appear in combination with the low - energy constant ( lec ) @xmath29 that measures the strength of the scalar quark condensate .",
    "finally , the meson decay constant @xmath30 as well as the baryon octet mass @xmath31 are the values in the chiral @xmath32 limit . in the models discussed in our work ,",
    "they are set to their physical values in the pertinent channels . at the leading order ( lo )",
    "the meson - baryon interaction is given by the so - called weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) term derived from the covariant derivative @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , the axial vector current @xmath34 , @xmath35 gives rise to the so - called born graphs , which encounter for the @xmath14- and @xmath36-channel exchange diagrams of the intermediate baryons .    at the next - to - leading chiral order the meson - baryon interaction is given entirely by contact terms .",
    "the details on the construction of the nlo lagrangian as well as its full form can be found in refs .",
    "the lecs that are introduced at this order encompass three so - called _ symmetry breakers _ ( responsible for the splitting of baryon masses ) as well as eleven additional lecs commonly referred to as _",
    "dynamical _ lecs .",
    "note , that putting the intermediate particles on their mass shell and projecting to the @xmath14-wave the number of dynamical structures can be reduced to four . for our purposes",
    ", here we only remark that the symmetry breakers can in principle be related to the baryon masses and to the pion - nucleon @xmath37 term while the dynamical lecs are very loosely restricted .",
    "typically , they are treated as free parameters .    in the paper",
    "we discuss all currently available theoretical approaches that incorporate nlo terms in the underlying chiral lagrangian and determine the free model parameters by @xmath38 fits that reproduce ( among others ) the most recent siddharta data on kaonic hydrogen . before doing so",
    ", one important remark is in order . according to the power counting , one expects the contribution of the nlo terms to be parametrically suppressed compared to the lo one .",
    "however , there can be exceptions to this .",
    "it is known that in chiral su(3 ) one can have large corrections due to kaon loops . however , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the first correction can be large and after that , the series behaves as expected . such a behavior",
    "is indeed observed in the chiral expansion of the baryon octet magnetic moments  @xcite .",
    "another possible enhancement of formerly subleading terms can arise from the presence of close - by resonances , as it is well known from the chiral expansion of the two - nucleon forces . here ,",
    "the n@xmath39lo corrections to some phase shifts are as large as the nlo ones , as the effects of the close - by @xmath40 are encoded in the lecs @xmath41 , which contribute first to the first corrections of the two - pion exchange , that appear at n@xmath39lo , see e.g. the review  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in some of the approaches discussed below , the formal suppression of the nlo terms is not imposed .",
    "+ * model types : kyoto - munich , murcia *    the kyoto - munich and murcia approaches for the antikaon - nucleon scattering rely on a similar theoretical assumption as described in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "there , the chiral potential of the leading and next - to - leading order , derived as described above , is put on the mass shell and projected onto the @xmath14-wave .",
    "the exact form of the projected chiral potentials and corresponding coupling matrices dictated by the su(3 ) symmetry can be found in e.g. ref .  @xcite . in the next step , the scattering amplitude @xmath42 is derived , resumming this potential in the coupled - channel bethe - salpeter equation in the on - shell approximation @xmath43 where every element represents a matrix in the channel space .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath44 contains the logarithmically ( uv ) divergent one - loop meson baryon integrals , which are tamed by dimensional regularization applying the @xmath45 subtraction scheme . in four dimensions and for a specific meson - baryon channel index @xmath46 it reads @xmath47   + g_{0}(\\sqrt{s},m_i , m_i)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 denotes the baryon ( meson ) masses of the intermediate particles and we introduced @xmath49 for the scale - independent part of the loop function , with @xmath50 the scale of dimensional regularization and @xmath51 the modulus of the center - of - mass ( cms ) three momentum in the pertinent channel . at any order of a full perturbative calculation this scale dependence cancels out the scale dependence of the contact terms . in a non - perturbative analysis relying on a driving term of any fixed chiral order",
    "the scale dependence remains , reflecting the missing higher order ( local ) terms not accounted for in the above definition of the scattering matrix .",
    "note also that the higher order corrections are channel dependent .",
    "therefore , to account for the missing topologies , the subtraction constants @xmath52 are used in each interaction channel as free parameters of the model .",
    "they are adjusted together with the low - energy constants to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "the exact values of the subtraction constants depend on the regularization scale @xmath50 adopted to be the same for all channels .",

    "the discussed approaches represent a variety of different philosophies they are built on .",
    "most of them ( the kyoto - munich , murcia , bonn ones ) use dimensional regularization to tame the ultraviolet divergences in the meson - baryon loop function and treat the meson - baryon interactions on the energy shell while the prague model introduces off - shell form factors to regularize the green function and phenomenologically accounts for the off - shell effects . all approaches but",
    "the bonn one are based on a potential concept , introducing an effective meson - baryon potential that matches the chiral amplitude up to a given order and is then used as a potential kernel in the lippmann - schwinger equation to sum a major part of the chiral perturbation series .",

    "finally , the kyoto - munich and prague models have relatively small nlo contributions ( representing only moderate corrections to the lo chiral interactions ) while the murcia and bonn models introduce sizable nlo terms that generate inter - channel couplings very different from those obtained by only the wt interaction .",
    "despite all these differences the models are able to reproduce the experimental data on a qualitatively very similar level and in mutual agreement especially concerning the data available at the @xmath3 threshold . the models also tend to agree on a position of the higher energy of the two poles generated for the @xmath2 resonance , predicting it at the complex energy with the real part @xmath109  mev and the imaginary part @xmath110  mev . however , that is about where the agreement among the model predictions ends .",

    "one of the novelties of our paper consists in a detailed analysis of the origins of the poles generated in the different approaches .",
    "we have done this by following the movement of the poles from their _ physical positions _ to the zcl with inter - channel couplings switched off .",
    "as far as the nlo couplings are small and represent only corrections to the leading order wt interaction the pole content of the models is restricted to those poles that originate from the @xmath5 , @xmath3 and @xmath13 channels .",
    "this is demonstrated by the prague and kyoto - munich models . on the other hand ,",
    "the murcia and bonn models discussed here incorporate quite sizable nlo contributions to meson - baryon interactions that lead to couplings sufficiently strong to generate poles in the zcl even in other channels .",
    "we have found that for two of the nlo models ( @xmath71 and @xmath82 ) the origin of the higher of the two poles assigned to the @xmath2 resonance can be traced to the @xmath111 bound state in the zcl .",
    "although one can not readily dismiss this possibility , it can be argued that the other models are more viable as they do not contradict the commonly accepted picture of the @xmath3 bound state that evolves into a resonance due to a strong coupling to the @xmath5 channel .",

    "a similar @xmath113 pole appears on the @xmath114 $ ] rs .",
    "since the isovector sector is not restricted much by the current experimental data the pole can be brought up to a position not far from the @xmath3 threshold and close to the real axis , where it can affect physical observables .",
    "the existence of the pole was already reported in refs .",

    "<S> we present a comparative analysis of the pertinent models and discuss in detail their pole contents . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the approaches lead to very different predictions for the @xmath0 amplitude extrapolated to subthreshold energies as well as for the @xmath1 amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the poles generated by the models is traced to the so - called zero coupling limit , in which the inter - channel couplings are switched off . </S>",
    "<S> this provides new insights into the pole contents of the various approaches . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , different concepts of forming the @xmath2 resonance are revealed and constraints related to the appearance of such poles in a given approach are discussed .    </S>",
