    "the dense granular flow of identical particles is a complex phenomenon which involves multiple processes such as friction , correlated motion and inelastic collisions @xcite .",
    "various flow regimes have been identified in different experiments .",
    "three major flow regimes are emphasized in figure  [ profiles ] .",
    "block motion occurs for example when particles form some jammed phases @xcite . in granular flows on a pile , only the surface grains are in motion .",
    "this rolling phase has typically a thickness of 10 - 20 grains and the velocity @xmath1 as a function of the height @xmath2 is roughly linear for that surface grains @xcite .     encountered in dense flows . from left to right : block motion , surface flow and poiseuille flow.,width=302 ]    a lot of efforts has been devoted to the understanding of dense flows of particles .",
    "some studies @xcite address the problem of contact force networks , i.e. the presence of arches , which plays an important role @xcite .",
    "fluctuations and correlations of the grain motion as a function of the shear rate have been also studied .",
    "collective behaviors have been put into evidence such as the motion of clusters of grains @xcite .",
    "different theoretical approaches have been developed for describing dense flows . among them , one can cite the saint - venant approach which considers some conservation equations in the rolling phase @xcite .",
    "pouliquen and coworkers @xcite have also proposed that the granular flows can be considered as quasi - static flows , the global motion resulting from fractures .",
    "nevertheless , no general theory can predict the occurrence of the different flow regimes and corresponding velocity profiles from the various physical parameters such as the density , the shear rate and the friction .    in 1947 ,",
    "bragg and coworkers proposed a simple experiment @xcite in order to put into evidence some crystallographic ordering .",
    "this experiment is also famous because it was quoted in the feynman s lectures @xcite .",
    "the experiment consisted in producing small identical bubbles at the surface of a liquid .",
    "hexagonal packed structures appeared and crystallographic domains separated by grain boundaries were observed .",
    "recent experiments @xcite were devoted to the study of defects in such bubble rafts .",
    "we propose to modify the bragg s experiment in order to study dense flows of identical bubbles .",
    "the flow of bubbles is of physical interest since contacting bubbles are characterized by a nearly zero friction @xcite !",
    "our experimental system corresponds thus to an `` ideal '' dense flow .",
    "we show in this letter that this system of bubbles presents a phase transition between two distinct dense flow regimes depending on the kinetic energy of the incoming bubbles .",
    "small air bubbles are injected from below at the bottom of the plane and rise towards the top where they aggregate on a linear rough obstacle .",
    "a sketch of the experimental setup ( left ) and typical bubble packing taken by the ccd camera placed above the setup ( right ) are illustrated .",

    "the angle is @xmath3 .",
    "arrows indicate the motion of bubbles.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    our experiment is analogous to the filling of a 2d - silo by continuous feeding of granular material from a central hopper .",
    "the experimental setup consists in a transparent inclined plane which is immersed into water [ see fig .  [ setup ] ] .",
    "the tilt angle @xmath0 is small and ranges from @xmath4 to @xmath5 in our experiments .",
    "the error on @xmath0 is @xmath6 .",
    "spherical air bubbles are injected from below at the bottom of the tilted plane .",
    "the bubble production rate is kept constant at @xmath7 bubbles by one second .",
    "the size of the bubbles can be controlled by the air pump .",
    "the bubble radius is typically @xmath8 mm in the present study . in order to avoid the coalescence of the bubbles , a small quantity of commercial soap ( based on sds surfactants @xcite )",
    "is added to the water .",
    "the mixture has a surface tension @xmath9 n / m and a viscosity @xmath10 kg@xmath11m@xmath12s@xmath13 . due to buoyancy @xmath14",
    ", the bubbles rise beneath the inclined plane .",
    "a rough rigid object has been placed at the top of the plane such that bubbles aggregate there .",
    "the obstacle roughness is typically one bubble diameter and avoids purely translational motions of the bubble stack @xcite .",
    "one should note that in the direction perpendicular to the plane , the bubble stack is only one layer of bubbles thick .",
    "we thus have a really 2d bubble pile .",
    "a ccd camera captures top views of the packing of bubbles through the transparent tilted plane .",
    "the unique parameter to be investigated is the tilt angle @xmath0 of the plane .",
    "indeed , the angle @xmath0 controls the buoyancy @xmath15 where @xmath16 kg m@xmath17 is the difference between air and liquid densities .",
    "one should also note that the bubble motion is mainly limited by the viscous drag force @xmath18 the bubble / plane friction is small with respect to the drag force @xmath19 as we will see below .",
    "force equilibrium @xmath20 gives the terminal incoming velocity @xmath21 of the bubbles which is a few millimeters per second since @xmath22 in our experiments .",
    "we are thus in a laminar regime ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "bubbles tend to aggregate in an ordered hexagonal packing since the bubble size is monodisperse .",
    "the packing is continuously fed by new bubbles . as a consequence",
    ", the packing evolves and a dense flow of bubbles is seen in both tails . as for usual granular flow , a thin layer of moving grains is observed @xcite . moreover , smaller motions are also observed deeper inside the packing , even for low @xmath0 values .",
    "figure  [ setup ] presents a typical packing of bubbles for @xmath24 .",
    "the shape of the pile is clearly rounded .",
    "if the incoming bubble flow is interrupted , the bubbles slide on each other under the influence of buoyancy and the angle of the bubble stack tends to zero .",
    "the pile collapses completely .",
    "this indicates that the friction between contacting bubbles is quite low , as discussed in the introduction . as contacting",
    "bubbles are sliding on each other , small shape deformations are also observed at the bottom of the pile .",
    "thus , the bubble pile is not a strict granular medium in the sense that no arch is created .        in the packing",
    ", the bubble motion is mainly due to moving dislocations [ see fig .  [ pack ] ] .",
    "those punctual defects are created at the surface of the packing and propagate along bubble lines at various speeds .",
    "one should note that the mean dislocation speed is larger than the bubble speed .",
    "this is due to the cooperative motion of the bubbles . for larger values of @xmath0 ,",
    "several dislocations are seen in the different parts of the pile .",
    "the majority of the bubbles is in motion .    in order to quantify and to measure the bubble flow ,",
    "we have tracked the motion of every bubble in the tail of the bubble pile .",
    "movies of the evolution of different parts of the bubble stack have been recorded at a frame rate of @xmath25 fps .",
    "the recorded areas contains typically @xmath26 bubbles .",
    "a precision of @xmath27 mm on bubble positions is obtained .",
    "we have then measured the bubble paths and deduced velocity profiles using a particle tracking algorithm .",
    "figure  [ champ ] presents two typical instantaneous ( @xmath28 s ) velocity fields in the tail of the bubble pile , for respectively @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "one can observe slow bubble motions for a small @xmath0 value ( left ) and moving layers of bubbles over a quasi - static phase for a larger @xmath0 value ( right ) .",
    "velocity measurements presented hereafter result from averages over long movies ( more than @xmath31s ) .     and ( right ) @xmath32 . the bubbles are observed to move from right to left .",
    "a block motion is observed for @xmath33 , while a velocity profile decreasing with the depth @xmath2 is found for @xmath34 .",

    "@xmath35 in the bubble pile as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "we propose a quadratic behavior of the mean velocity as emphasized by the fit in figure  [ activ ] .",
    "the mean velocity @xmath35 would then be controled by the tilt angle @xmath0 and would be proportional to the kinetic energy ( @xmath37 ) of individual bubbles before they reach the packing .     as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "each dot represents an average over @xmath38 pictures and over @xmath39 bubbles .",
    "error bars are indicated .",
    "the curve is a fit emphasizing a @xmath40 behavior.,width=226,height=188 ]     defined by eq.([eqt ] ) as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "a broad transition is seen at @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "each dot represents an average over @xmath38 pictures and over @xmath39 bubbles .",
    "error bars are indicated.,width=226,height=188 ]    in order to characterize the bubble flow , we have also performed measurements of the velocity fluctuations , similarly to the granular ` temperature ' @xcite .",
    "the velocity fluctuations amplitude @xmath43 is then defined by @xmath44 i.e. the second moment of the velocity distribution in both @xmath45 and @xmath46 directions @xcite .",
    "those velocity fluctuations @xmath43 are plotted as a function of @xmath36 in figure  [ t ] .",
    "one can observe a ` jump ' of the velocity fluctuations @xmath43 for tilt angles above @xmath47 .",
    "this suggests the presence of a broad second - order phase transition as a function of the tilt angle @xmath0 .",
    "the critical angle corresponds to @xmath48 .",
    "around this critical angle , two dense flow regimes should be distinguished .",
    "they will be characterized below .    for low angle values ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "the dislocations are created at the surface of the pile .",
    "they propagate in diagonal directions and are reflected at the bottom of the bubble packing . as a consequence",
    ", we have observed the motion of giant triangular domains of bubbles . above the critical angle @xmath50 ,",
    "we observe numerous dislocations .",
    "the density of dislocations is so high that they are interacting by pairs .",
    "indeed , we have observed the collision , the merging , and the annihilation of dislocation pairs .",
    "the cooperative motion of the dislocations lead to the motion of small clusters of bubbles .",
    "the above behaviors imply distinct velocity profiles .",
    "velocity profiles have been measured as a function of the vertical position @xmath2 reduced by the bubble diameter @xmath51 and counted from the obstacle .",
    "three typical velocity profiles are given in figure  [ prof ] .",
    "velocity profiles @xmath52 reveal two components : ( i ) a mainly constant profile which dominates for low @xmath0 values and ( ii ) a curved profile ( a gradient ) seen for high @xmath0 values .",
    "the curvature above @xmath53 is similar to the velocity profile of granular systems [ see fig  [ profiles ] ] : a velocity profile decreasing abruptly in the more static phase ( e.g. deeper in the pile ) and growing in the flowing layer @xcite .",
    "the velocity profile penetrates as deeply in the pile as the tilt angle @xmath0 value is large , as in granular systems @xcite .",
    "for respectively @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "below @xmath53 , we observe nearly constant vertical profile as in block motions , while above , we obtain a granular - like profile.,width=264 ]    the ` vertical ' profiles at low @xmath0 values can be explained in terms of block motions of the giant triangular domains of bubbles .",
    "domains are sliced by fast moving dislocations . as the kinetic energy of the incoming bubbles increases ,",
    "the size of the bubble domains decreases .",
    "the density of dislocations increases and the bubble stack becomes more ` fluid ' . at this stage ,",
    "interacting dislocations which are created at the surface of the flow are observed to annihilate deep in the dense flow .",
    "the study of the interaction / annihilation between dislocations could explain the particular curvature of our velocity profiles .",
    "this needs more theoretical work and is outside the scope of this letter .",
    "the ` jump ' in the velocity fluctuations @xmath43 suggests that we have a transition between block and granular flows depending on the density of dislocations in the packing .",
    "varying the bubble size @xmath57 or the bubble production rate does not affect qualitatively the results reported herein .",
    "moreover , the bubble motions and dislocation mechanisms reported hereabove are also observed when changing the soap - water mixture .    in the future",
    ", the analogy between granular and bubble flows could be developed by changing the geometry of the bubble flow and considering `` chute flow '' . by tilting the rough obstacle relatively to the incomming bubble flow",
    ", one would get a `` chute '' flow of bubble on an inclined substrate . tuning the bubble rate production and",
    "the tilt angle , could control the thickness of the flowing layer .",
    "we have studied bubbles moving and aggregating on inclined planes .",
    "we have underlined the similarities between dense bubble flows and granular flows .",
    "dense bubble flows can be considered as ` ideal ' granular flows with nearly zero friction .",
    "we have emphasized a broad second - order transition between two dense flow regimes as a function of the tilt angle @xmath0 of the plane below which the bubbles are injected .",
