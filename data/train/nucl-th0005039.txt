    "the discrepancy between the calculated binding energy differences of mirror nuclei and those measured is a long - standing problem in nuclear physics .",
    "it is known as the okamoto - nolen - schiffer ( ons ) anomaly @xcite .",
    "although it was first thought that electromagnetic effects could almost account for the observed binding energy differences , it is now believed that the ons anomaly has its origin in charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) in the strong interaction @xcite .",
    "in addition to calculations based on charge symmetry violating meson exchange potentials @xcite , a number of quark - based calculations have been performed @xcite in an attempt to resolve this anomaly . in such calculations",
    ", csb enters through the up ( u ) and down ( d ) current quark mass difference in qcd . despite these efforts ,",
    "the difficulty of producing a realistic description of nuclear structure on the basis of explicit quark degrees of freedom has hindered the direct calculation of the binding energy differences .    in this study",
    "we report the results for the binding energy differences of the valence ( excess ) proton and neutron of the mirror nuclei , @xmath0o ",
    "@xmath0n , @xmath1f ",
    "@xmath1o , @xmath2ca  @xmath2k and @xmath3sc  @xmath3ca , calculated using a quark - based model involving explicit nuclear structure and shell effects , namely the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite .",
    "this model has been successfully applied not only to traditional nuclear problems @xcite but also to other new areas as well @xcite .",
    "although some exploratory qmc results on the ons anomaly have already been reported @xcite , an early version of the model was used there , and it was applied to finite nuclei only through local density approximation , rather than a consistent shell model calculation .",
    "in this section , we introduce the qmc model , and then report the medium modification of the nucleon properties in finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that a free nucleon ( at the origin ) consists of three light ( u and d ) quarks under a ( lorentz scalar ) confinement potential , @xmath4 .",
    "then , the dirac equation for the quark field @xmath5 is given by _",
    "q(r ) = 0 , [ dirac1 ] where @xmath6 is the bare quark mass .",
    "next we consider how equation ( [ dirac1 ] ) is modified when the nucleon is bound in static , uniformly distributed ( iso - symmetric ) nuclear matter . in the qmc model",
    "@xcite it is assumed that each quark feels scalar , @xmath7 , and vector , @xmath8 , potentials , which are generated by the surrounding nucleons , as well as the confinement potential .",
    "this assumption seems appropriate when the nuclear density @xmath9 is near around normal nuclear matter density ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) . if we use the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) for the meson fields , equation ( [ dirac1 ] )",
    "may be rewritten as _",
    "q(r ) = 0 .",
    "[ dirac2 ] the potentials generated by the medium are constants because the matter distributes uniformly .",
    "as the nucleon is static , the time - derivative operator in the dirac equation can be replaced by the quark energy , @xmath12 . by analogy with the procedure applied to the nucleon in qhd @xcite , if we introduce the effective quark mass by @xmath13 , the dirac equation ( [ dirac2 ] ) can be rewritten in the same form as that in free space with the mass @xmath14 and the energy @xmath15 , instead of @xmath6 and @xmath16 . in other words ,",
    "the vector interaction has _ no effect on the nucleon structure _ except for an overall phase in the quark wave function , which gives a shift in the nucleon energy .",
    "this fact _ does not _ depend on how to choose the confinement potential , @xmath4 .",
    "then , the nucleon energy at rest in the medium is given by @xmath17 , where the effective nucleon mass @xmath18 depends on _ only the scalar potential_.    we can extend this idea to finite nuclei @xcite . let us suppose that the scalar and vector potentials in equation ( [ dirac2 ] ) are mediated by the @xmath19 and @xmath20 mesons , and introduce their mean - field values , which now depend on position @xmath21 , by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the coupling constant of the quark-@xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) meson .",
    "furthermore , we shall add the isovector vector meson , @xmath26 , and the coulomb field , @xmath27 , to describe finite nuclei realistically . then",
    ", the effective lagrangian density for finite nuclei would be given by @xcite _ qmc&= & [ i - m_n^ - g__0 - g _ b _ 0 - ( 1+^n_3 ) a _ 0 ] [ qmc-1 ] + & - & [ ( ) ^2 + m_^2 ^2 ] + [ ( ) ^2 + m_^2 ^2 ] + [ ( b)^2 + m_^2 b^2 ] + ( a)^2 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the nucleon and the @xmath26 fields .",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the masses of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath26 mesons . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively the @xmath20-n and @xmath26-n coupling constants , which are given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is the quark-@xmath26 coupling constant ) .",
    "if we define the field - dependent @xmath19-n coupling constant , @xmath38 , by @xcite m_n^((r ) ) m_n - g_((r ) ) ( r ) , [ coup ] where @xmath39 is the free nucleon mass , it is easy to compare with qhd @xcite .",
    "the difference between qmc and qhd lies only in the coupling constant @xmath40 , which depends on the scalar field in qmc while it is constant in qhd .",
    "however , this difference leads to a lot of favorable results @xcite .",
    "now we need a model for the structure of the nucleon involved to perform actual calculations .",
    "we here use the mit bag model . in the present model , the bag constant , @xmath41 , and the @xmath42 parameter for the nucleon",
    "are fixed to reproduce the free nucleon mass ( @xmath39 = 939 mev ) and the free bag radius @xmath43 = 0.8 fm . in the following we choose @xmath6 = 5 mev and set @xmath30 = 550 mev , @xmath44 = 783 mev and @xmath32 = 770 mev .",
    "( variations of the quark mass and @xmath43 only lead to numerically small changes in the calculated results @xcite . )",
    "we then find that @xmath45 = 170.0 mev and @xmath42 = 3.295 .    for infinite nuclear matter , from the lagrangian density ( [ qmc-1 ] )",
    ", we can easily find the total energy per nucleon , @xmath46 , and the mean - field values of @xmath20 and @xmath26 ( which are respectively given by baryon number conservation and the difference in proton and neutron densities ) .",
    "the scalar mean - field is given by a self - consistency condition , @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the coupling constants , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are fixed to fit the average binding energy ( @xmath50 mev ) at @xmath51 for nuclear matter .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath26-n coupling constant is used to reproduce the bulk symmetry energy , 35 mev .",
    "we then find @xcite : @xmath52 = 5.40 , @xmath53 = 5.31 , @xmath54 = 6.93 , and the nuclear incompressibility , @xmath55 mev .",
    "note that the model gives the variation of the nucleon bag radius , @xmath56 , the lowest quark eigenvalue , @xmath57 and the root - mean - square radius of the quark wave function , @xmath58 , at saturation density .    using these parameters",
    ", we can solve a finite nuclear system .",
    "as an example , we show charge density distribution of @xmath59ca in figure [ fig:40ca ] . the qmc model can reproduce the properties of not only nuclear matter but also finite nuclei ( for more details , see @xcite ) .      here",
    "we consider the nucleon mass in matter furthermore .",
    "the nucleon mass is a function of the scalar field . because the scalar field is small at low density the mass",
    "may be expanded in terms of @xmath19 as m_n^ = m_n + ( ) _ = 0 + ( ) _ = 0 ^2 + o(^3 ) .",
    "[ nuclm ] since the interaction hamiltonian between the nucleon and the @xmath19 field at the quark level is given by @xmath60 , the derivative of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath19 is @xmath61 , where we have defined the quark scalar charge in the nucleon , @xmath62 , which is itself a function of @xmath19 . because of a negative value of the derivative , the nucleon mass decreases in matter at low density .",
    "furthermore , we define the scalar - charge ratio , @xmath63 , to be @xmath64 and the @xmath19-n coupling constant in free space to be @xmath40 ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) . using these quantities",
    ", we find m_n^ = m_n - g _ - g _",
    "c_n^(0 ) ^2 + o(^3 ) .",
    "[ nuclm2 ] in general , @xmath66 is a decreasing function because the quark in matter becomes more relativistic than in free space .",
    "thus , @xmath67 takes a negative value .",
    "if the nucleon were structureless @xmath66 would not depend on @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , only the first two terms in the rhs of equation ( [ nuclm2 ] ) remain , which is exactly the same as the effective nucleon mass in qhd @xcite .",
    "now we introduce the charge symmetry breaking in the qmc model @xcite .",
    "the charge symmetry is explicitly broken at the quark level through their masses .",
    "we use different values for the u and d current quark masses , and the effective proton , @xmath68 , and neutron , @xmath69 , masses . at position @xmath70 in a nucleus",
    "( the coordinate origin is taken at the center of the nucleus ) , the dirac equations for the quarks in the proton or neutron bag are given by (    c _",
    "u(x ) + _ d(x ) +    ) = 0 , [ diraceq ] where @xmath71 ( @xmath72 specifies proton or neutron ) . note that we have assumed that the scalar potential is common to both the u and d quarks .",
    "the nucleon and meson fields are calculated self - consistently by solving a set of coupled non - linear differential equations , derived from the effective lagrangian density ( [ qmc-1 ] ) with the proper modifications caused by the different proton and neutron ( or u and d quark ) masses in mfa .",
    "thus , the present calculation is free from the sort of double counting questioned by auerbach @xcite , and includes the shell effects , which were discussed by cohen et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".inputs , parameters and some of the quantities calculated in the present study .",
    "the quantities with a star , @xmath73 , are those quantities calculated at @xmath51 .",
    "we take @xmath74 mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table [ summary ] , we summarize the calculated single - particle energies for the valence proton and neutron of several mirror nuclei ( in csb ) @xcite . comparing the @xmath26-potential contributions for the hole states with core plus valence states , one notices the shell effects due to the @xmath26-potentials .",
    "these results reflect the difference in the shell structure , namely the hole states tend to have larger @xmath26-potential contributions than the core plus valence nucleon states .",
    "the binding energy differences obtained indicate that the prime csb effects originate in the u - d current quark mass difference .",
    "the calculated binding energy differences give of the order of about a few hundred kev .",
    "this is precisely the order of magnitude which is observed as the ons anomaly @xcite .",
    "using the qmc model , we have discussed csb in nuclear medium and calculated the ons anomaly in mirror nuclei , including the quark degrees of freedom explicitly .",
    "we stress that the present contribution to the ons anomaly is based on a very simple but novel idea , namely the slight difference between the quark scalar densities of the u and d quarks in a bound nucleon , which stems from the u and d quark mass difference @xcite .",
    "this implies that the in - medium proton-@xmath19 and neutron-@xmath19 coupling constants differ from their values in free space and that the neutron - proton effective mass difference is reduced in matter .",
    "our results were obtained within an explicit shell model calculation , based on quark degrees of freedom .",
    "they show that once csb is set through the u and d current quark mass difference so as to reproduce the proton and neutron masses in free space , it can produces binding energy differences for the valence ( excess ) proton and neutron of mirror nuclei of a few hundred kev .",
    "the origin of this effect is so simple that it is natural to conclude that a sizable fraction of csb in mirror nuclei arises from the density dependence of the u and d quark scalar densities in a bound nucleon .",
    "it is a fascinating challenge for the future to compare this result with the traditional mechanism involving @xmath75 mixing @xcite .",
    "this will involve the issue of the possible momentum dependence of the @xmath75 mixing amplitude @xcite .",
    "in addition , one would need to examine whether there is any deeper connection between these apparently quite different sources of charge symmetry violation .",
