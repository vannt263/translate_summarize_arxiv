    "several microscopic scenarios have been proposed as underlying mechanisms for dynamical arrest in supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "because this dramatic slowing down is accompanied by the onset of dynamical heterogeneity@xcite , a promising candidate model should account for the spontaneous segregation of rapidly relaxing and slowly relaxing domains . the theory of frustration - limited domains has been developed with this condition in mind@xcite .",
    "the basic units of this theory are microscopic regions of low internal energy whose spatial extent is limited by long - ranged interactions or constraints .",
    "nelson and coworkers suggested that such domains form in simple `` atomic '' liquids ( such as metallic glass - formers)@xcite . for small clusters of particles ,",
    "icosahedral arrangements are energetically preferred over closest - packed configurations representative of the crystalline state@xcite .",
    "it is thus argued that a supercooled atomic liquid is rich in low - energy icosahedral clusters which , for geometric reasons , can not extend indefinitely . in this case ,",
    "frustration is a consequence of the vanishing curvature of euclidean space .",
    "one can imagine that the nature of local order and source of frustration are somewhat different for other , more complicated materials .",
    "the frustration - limited domain theory has several attractive features . by associating relaxation kinetics with the interfacial area of domain walls",
    ", it predicts a crossover in the temperature dependence of structural rearrangement times from arrhenius to a super - arrhenius form . such a crossover is prominent in experiments with fragile glass - formers@xcite .",
    "further , the theoretical scaling exponent for the asymptotic super - arrhenius temperature dependence appears to be consistent with experimental data .",
    "finally , the notion of frustration - limited domains resonates with the picture of heterogeneous dynamics that has emerged from experiments@xcite and simulations@xcite .",
    "while local structure within low - energy clusters may be effectively frozen on a molecular time scale , relaxation can be facile at the strained interfaces between domains .",
    "this argument is the essence of stillinger s `` tear and repair '' picture of shear flow in fragile liquids@xcite .",
    "although these dynamical predictions of frustration - limited domain theory are suggestive , they are fundamentally thermodynamic in nature and thus indirect . in order to make such arguments precise , grousson _",
    "have recently focused on the explicit dynamics of minimal models exhibiting frustration - limited domains@xcite .",
    "specifically , they have simulated stochastic dynamics of several classical spin models that pit short - ranged , ferromagnetic interactions against long - ranged , antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "in addition to confirming super - arrhenius relaxation for these models at low temperatures , they have demonstrated that the `` fragility '' of the dynamics ( i.e. , the degree of deviation from arrhenius form ) varies continuously with the relative strength of the long - ranged frustration .",
    "quite recently , grousson _",
    "have performed dynamical mode coupling calculations for the same models , but no direct comparisons to their earlier simulations were made@xcite . in this paper , we perform similar calculations that are compared directly to numerical simulations .",
    "schmalian and coworkers have also argued that such a coulomb - frustrated ferromagnet should display essential features of glassy dynamics@xcite . in their analysis , it is a proliferation of metastable states that drives vitrification . with the aid of replica mean field theory ,",
    "this perspective predicts a scaling of fragility with frustration strength that agrees well with the simulation results of ref.@xcite .",
    "but like the theory of frustration - limited domains , this analysis is _ thermodynamic _ in nature , relying on an assumed correspondence between particular subensembles of high free energy and genuine dynamical bottlenecks .",
    "this paper addresses the extent to which the slow relaxation in such simplified models truly resembles that of molecular glass - forming liquids . for this purpose",
    "we investigate in detail the _ dynamics _ of a model closely related to those studied in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model and dynamical propagation rules we consider , which are free of artificially quenched disorder and kinetic constraints , are described in sec .",
    "2 . for several values of the frustration strength",
    ", we compare the time dependence of spin correlations computed in simulations with those predicted by approximate theoretical approaches .",
    "two self - consistent dynamical equations obtained from theory are discussed in sec .",
    "they correspond to resummations of an exact , infinite diagrammatic series for time correlations .",
    "the first resummation , yielding exponential relaxation at each wave vector , is a direct dynamical generalization of brazovskii s static result for this class of models@xcite .",
    "calculations based on this straightforward approach agree remarkably well with simulation results , described in sec . 4 , even for temperatures approaching a thermodynamic transition to a fully ordered state .",
    "the second resummation is formally analogous to the idealized mode coupling theory of liquids .",
    "as such , it predicts loss of ergodicity at finite temperature .",
    "by contrast , we find no evidence of nonergodic behavior or two - step relaxation for simulated disordered states of this model .",
    "surprisingly , then , the hartree approach is the more accurate approximation for slowly relaxing disordered states of the model system .",
    "detailed comparison of simulation and theory confirms that sluggishness indeed arises from de  gennes narrowing ( i.e. , from dramatic changes in static correlations ) , in contrast to complex dynamical mechanisms such as mode coupling . in this respect , the minimal model we have studied does not capture important aspects of supercooled liquid dynamics , specifically the intermediate time plateau and long time stretching of dynamical correlators .",

    "we have confirmed this fact by computing the work to reversibly impose long - range order ( i.e. , nonzero @xmath99 at @xmath14 ) .",
    "although the static hartree approximation suggests that the states of lowest temperature considered for each @xmath10 have global free energy minima in ordered configurations , the computed free energy of the paramagnetic state is in fact lower for each case .",
    "this quantitative failure of brazovskii s approximation is not surprising , as the relevant states lie outside the strict range of validity of the approximation for @xmath48@xcite .",
    "our analysis thus leaves unexplored a narrow window of the disordered state extremely close to @xmath100 .",
    "while it is possible that qualitatively new dynamical behavior arises in this region , it can not account for the dramatic slowing down we have demonstrated at higher temperature , which is driven by extreme structural changes rather than activated processes . furthermore , the sudden onset of nontrivial behavior would be in stark contrast to the more gradual onset of caging and stretched exponential behavior in real liquids .",
    "we have examined in detail a simple model that is closely related to the frustration - limited domain theory of kivelson , tarjus and coworkers@xcite , and to the uniformly frustrated `` stripe - glass '' model studied by schmalian and wolynes@xcite .",
    "the disordered phase of this model system indeed displays some hallmarks of molecular glass - forming liquids .",
    "but its dynamics differ qualitatively from generic glassy behavior in several respects .    while relaxation times increase dramatically in these models in a non - arrhenius fashion as temperature",
    "is lowered , we find that an optimized harmonic reference system captures the time dependence of fluctuations semi - quantitatively .",
    "in contrast to the vitrification of molecular liquids , the onset of this sluggishness is _ not _ accompanied by significant power law or stretched exponential decay of correlations in time .",
    "perhaps most importantly , we find that the the slow decay of dynamical correlations is driven by significant changes in static structure .",
    "an idealized mode - coupling theory captures these changes less accurately than the simpler harmonic approach , predicting caging and eventual trapping at temperatures where the simulated dynamics remain exponential and ergodic .",
    "together , these results strongly suggest that slow dynamics of this model system arise from the same gaussian fluctuations that drive the microphase separation transition first order .",
    "this conclusion differs markedly from those of kivelson _",
    "et al._@xcite , grousson _",
    "et al._@xcite , and of schmalian and wolynes@xcite , which invoke activated barrier crossing to explain the dramatic temperature dependence of relaxation times .",
    "uniform frustration alone thus appears insufficient to account for the unusual relaxation properties of supercooled liquids .",
    "it remains possible , of course , that such frustration plays a key role , but in concert with other important physical mechanisms and constraints .",
    "the simulations described in this paper constitute a thorough study of the thermodynamically disordered phase of a uniformly frustrated model .",
    "they raise some interesting questions about such models and leave others unaddressed . in particular , while glassy behavior is not manifest for @xmath20 , we can not rule out the existence of caging or trapping extremely close to or below the microphase separation temperature ( since relaxation at these temperatures is prohibitively slow ) . to explore this possibility , we have simulated several initially disordered states with @xmath101 . their nonequilibrium evolution towards long - ranged order exhibits the self - similar aging characteristic of coarsening phenomena , but for numerically accessible time scales does not resemble the relaxation of a supercooled liquid .",
    "nonexponential equilibrium relaxation could yet emerge at temperatures above but _ very _ near the order - disorder transition@xcite .",
    "eastwood and wolynes have in fact recently suggested that , for certain spin models , surface tension effects drive the onset of activated dynamics nearly to the ideal glass transition temperature@xcite .",
    "although quite interesting , such behavior would itself be uncharacteristic of glass - forming liquids , as it would appear only within an extremely narrow thermodynamic range .",
