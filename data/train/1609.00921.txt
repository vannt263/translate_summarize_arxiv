    "one of the key challenges in neuroscience is how the human brain activities can be mapped to the different brain tasks . as a conjunction between neuroscience and computer science , multi - voxel pattern analysis ( mvpa ) @xcite addresses this question by applying machine learning methods on task - based functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) datasets .",
    "analyzing the patterns of visual objects is one of the most interesting topics in mvpa , which can enable us to understand how brain stores and processes the visual stimuli @xcite .",
    "it can be used for finding novel treatments for mental diseases or even creating a new generation of the user interface in the future .",
    "technically , there are two challenges in previous studies .",
    "the first challenge is decreasing sparsity and noise in preprocessed voxels .",
    "since , most of the previous studies directly utilized voxels for predicting the stimuli , the trained features are mostly sparse , high - dimensional and noisy ; and they contain trivial useful information @xcite .",
    "the second challenge is increasing the performance of prediction .",
    "most of the brain decoding problems employed binary classifiers especially by using a one - versus - all strategy @xcite . in addition , multi - class predictors are even mostly based on the binary classifiers such as the error - correcting output codes ( ecoc ) methods @xcite .",
    "since task - based fmri experiments are mostly imbalance , it is so hard to train an effective binary classifier in the brain decoding problems . for instance , consider collected data with 10 same size categories . since this dataset is imbalance for one - versus - all binary classification , most of the classical algorithms can not provide acceptable performance @xcite .    for facing mentioned problems",
    ", this paper proposes anatomical pattern analysis ( apa ) as a general framework for decoding visual stimuli in the human brain .",
    "this framework employs a novel feature extraction method , which uses the brain anatomical regions for generating a normalized view . in practice",
    ", this view can enable us to combine homogeneous datasets .",
    "the feature extraction method also can automatically detect the active regions for each category of the visual stimuli .",
    "indeed , it can decrease noise and sparsity and increase the performance of the final result .",
    "further , this paper develops a modified version of imbalance adaboost algorithm for binary classification .",
    "this algorithm uses a supervised random sampling and penalty values , which are calculated by the correlation between different classes , for improving the performance of prediction .",
    "this binary classification will be used in a one - versus - all ecoc method as a multi - class approach for classifying the categories of the brain response .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , this study briefly reviews some related works .",
    "then , it introduces the proposed method in section 3 .",
    "experimental results are reported in section 4 ; and finally , this paper presents conclusion and pointed out some future works in section 5 .",
    "there are three different types of studies for decoding visual stimuli in the human brain .",
    "pioneer studies just focused on the special regions of the human brain , such as the fusiform face area ( ffa ) or parahippocampal place area ( ppa ) .",
    "they only proved that different stimuli can provide different responses in those regions , or found most effective locations based on different stimuli @xcite .",
    "the next group of studies introduced different correlation techniques for understanding similarity or difference between responses to different visual stimuli .",
    "haxby et al",
    ". recently showed that different visual stimuli , i.e. human faces , animals , etc .",
    ", represent different responses in the brain @xcite .",
    "further , rice et al . proved that not only the mentioned responses are different based on the categories of the stimuli , but also they are correlated based on different properties of the stimuli .",
    "they used gist technique for extracting the properties of stimuli and calculated the correlations between these properties and the brain responses .",
    "they separately reported the correlation matrices for different human faces and different objects ( houses , chairs , bottles , shoes ) @xcite .",
    "the last group of studies proposed the mvpa techniques for predicting the category of visual stimuli .",
    "cox et al . utilized linear and non - linear versions of support vector machine ( svm ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "norman et al . argued for using svm and gaussian naive bayes classifiers @xcite .",
    "carroll et al .",
    "employed the elastic net for prediction and interpretation of distributed neural activity with sparse models @xcite .",
    "varoquaux et al .",
    "proposed a small - sample brain mapping by using sparse recovery on spatially correlated designs with randomization and clustering .",
    "their method is applied on small sets of brain patterns for distinguishing different categories based on a one - versus - one strategy @xcite .",
    "mcmenamin et al .",
    "studied subsystems underlie abstract - category ( ac ) recognition and priming of objects ( e.g. , cat , piano ) and specific - exemplar ( se ) recognition and priming of objects ( e.g. , a calico cat , a different calico cat , a grand piano , etc . ) .",
    "technically , they applied svm on manually selected rois in the human brain for generating the visual stimuli predictors @xcite .",
    "mohr et al . compared four different classification methods , i.e. l1/2 regularized svm , the elastic net , and the graph net , for predicting different responses in the human brain .",
    "they show that l1-regularization can improve classification performance while simultaneously providing highly specific and interpretable discriminative activation patterns @xcite .",
    "osher et al .",
    "proposed a network ( graph ) based approach by using anatomical regions of the human brain for representing and classifying the different visual stimuli responses ( faces , objects , bodies , scenes ) @xcite .",

    "blood oxygen level dependent ( bold ) signals are used in fmri techniques for representing the neural activates . based on hyperalignment problem in the brain decoding @xcite ,",
    "quantity values of the bold signals in the same experiment for the two subjects are usually different .",
    "therefore , mvpa techniques use the correlation between different voxels as the pattern of the brain response @xcite .",
    "as depicted in figure 1 , each fmri experiment includes a set of sessions ( time series of 3d images ) , which can be captured by different subjects or just repeating the imaging procedure with a unique subject .",
    "technically , each session can be partitioned into a set of visual stimuli categories .",
    "indeed , an independent category denotes a set of homogeneous conditions , which are generated by using the same type of photos as the visual stimuli .",
    "for instance , if a subject watches 6 photos of cats and 5 photos of houses during a unique session , this 4d image includes 2 different categories and 11 conditions .",
    "consider @xmath0number of scans @xmath1",

    "design matrix can be calculated by convolution @xmath11 of onsets ( or time series @xmath12 ) and the hemodynamic response function ( hrf ) @xcite .",

    "moreover , the data @xmath3 is partitioned based on the conditions of the design matrix as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the set of all conditions in each session , @xmath7 and @xmath23 are respectively the number of categories in each session and the number of conditions in each category .",
