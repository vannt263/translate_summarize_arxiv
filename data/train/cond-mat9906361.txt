    "an experimental enquiry of the internal structure of a complex system involves , usually , some type of a scattering process .",
    "for instance , a photon is scattered from the system and then collected by a remote detector . in other situations , the collected objects are fragments of the initial system itself .",
    "a prototype example of the latter process is the photodissociation of molecules : the molecule absorbs a photon , and disintegrate by redistribution of energy in its vibrational modes@xcite .",
    "a common feature of such systems is the coupling to continuum modes .",
    "namely , above some energy threshold , the system is open .",
    "open systems are characterized by resonances .",
    "these are eigenstates of open hamiltonians which are normalizable , and therefore correspond to complex eigenvalues associated with a decay in time . in most interesting situations ,",
    "this decay is sufficiently slow , allowing for the system to explore a large part of the phase space before disintegration . in complex systems , such as nuclei or large molecules ,",
    "the dynamics on these long lived resonances is chaotic , therefore , the expectation value of a generic observable exhibits a statistical behavior@xcite .",
    "for instance , the absorption cross section for photodissociation of large molecules is a pseudorandom function of the photon energy@xcite .",
    "this behavior suggests a statistical analysis of observables in open chaotic systems @xcite .    the main purpose of this paper is to construct a diagrammatic scheme for calculating correlators of observables in open chaotic systems .",
    "this diagrammatic approach is similar to the cross diagram technic in disordered systems@xcite .",
    "however , although both techniques rely on the semiclassical approximation there are differences : the main advantage of the proposed scheme is in its capability of describing individual systems rather than an ensemble of them .",
    "ensemble averaging , as opposed to the energy averaging employed here , tends to erase `` clean '' features of individual systems .",
    "these features may have important manifestations , as will be demonstrated in this paper . on the other hand ,",
    "disorder diagrammatics provides a systematic way of calculating corrections due to quantum interference effects . at this stage",
    "we are not able to provide a similar prescription for general chaotic systems .",
    "therefore , we confine our attention to open systems with decay time shorter than the time at which weak localization effects set in .",
    "the latter time scale , known as the ehernfest time , diverges logarithmically in the semiclassical limit@xcite .",
    "the semiclassical analysis of a quantum system brings out the relation to its underlying classical dynamics@xcite .",
    "for example , the classical dynamics of an electron in a disordered metal is diffusive , and ensemble averages of quantum observables of the electron are expressed in terms of the spectral properties of the diffusion propagator@xcite . in more general situations the classical evolution is described by the perron - frobenius operator whose spectrum , known as the ruelle resonances@xcite , describes the irreversible relaxation of probability densities in phase space .    the classical spectrum of the system sets the important time scales of the problem . when the system is almost close there are two significant time scales : one is the decay time of the system , @xmath1 , which is inversely proportional to the typical width of the resonances .",
    "the closer is the system , the longer is the decay time .",
    "the second time scale , @xmath2 , is the time which takes for a classical density distribution to relax to the ergodic state on the energy shell , when the system is closed . in diffusive systems",
    "this time is known as the thouless time@xcite .",
    "a large separation between the classical time scales , @xmath3 , implies a universal statistical behavior of the system on energy scales smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "namely , the statistics is described by a random matrix theory@xcite suitable for open systems@xcite . however , as will be demonstrated in this paper , there are important manifestations of the nonuniversal behavior of the system , which are especially pronounced when @xmath1 is of the same order as @xmath2",
    ". the main use of the diagrammatic approach will be to calculate these individual imprints the system .",
    "this information is most important for constructing effective models from experimental data .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive the classical propagator of the system by energy averaging of green functions .",
    "this propagator constitutes the basic building block of the diagrammatic approach developed in section 3 .",
    "we shall restrict our considerations to systems with time reversal symmetry . in section 4",
    "we present two applications of the formalism .",
    "one concerns the microwave experiment on the @xmath5-disk scattering system@xcite .",
    "the second is the photodissociation absorption cross section of complex molecules . in section 5",
    "we summarize our results , and mention directions of further studies .",
    "the purpose of this section is to construct the building block of the diagrammatic scheme which will be developed in this paper .",
    "it is the classical propagator , which is a generalization of the `` diffuson '' ladder diagrams of disordered systems@xcite .",
    "our construction will rely on the semiclassical approximation for the green function of the quantum system@xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be the hamiltonian of an open system having @xmath7 degrees of freedom , and @xmath8 be its classical counterpart , where @xmath9 is a point in the classical phase space .",
    "the advanced ( @xmath10 ) and retarded ( @xmath11 ) green functions of the system are @xmath12 where @xmath13 denote an infinitesimal positive imaginary part . in the semiclassical limit , these green functions contain two contributions : @xmath14 the first , known as the weyl term , is a smooth function of the energy given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is planck s constant , and @xmath17 .",
    "the second contribution is an oscillatory function of the energy expressed as a sum over the classical trajectories@xcite from @xmath18 to @xmath19 with energy @xmath20 : @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the classical action of the @xmath23-th trajectory , while @xmath24 is an amplitude which can be expressed as a combination of second derivatives of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath18 .      to construct the classical propagator of the system from an energy average of green functions ,",
    "consider the following function @xmath25 where the @xmath26-function operator is defined by the symmetric fourier transform@xcite : @xmath27}. \\label{deltadefinition}\\ ] ] although not written explicitly , it will be assumed that these @xmath26-functions have a small finite width , say the integration over @xmath28 and @xmath29 is limited to a large hypersphere .",
    "this width will be taken to zero at the end of the calculation . substituting definition ( [ deltadefinition ] ) in ( [ pi0 ] ) we obtain @xmath30 next , we substitute the semiclassical approximation for the green functions .",
    "each green function has a smooth and an oscillatory contribution , thus , there are four terms in @xmath31 . however , it is easy to see that two of them , @xmath32 , vanish upon averaging",
    ". therefore only the weyl , @xmath33 , and the oscillatory , @xmath34 , contributions survive .",
    "the weyl term is local in phase space , namely it is significant only when @xmath35 .",
    "this term , which we denote by @xmath36 , is of minor importance for our purposes , and we defer its calculation to appendix a. the result , however , is @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "consider now the contribution from the oscillatory parts of the green functions .",
    "the product , @xmath39 , consists in a double sum over trajectories : @xmath23 from @xmath40 to @xmath41 and @xmath42 from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , thus @xmath45 an illustration of two such orbits is depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "this term is , clearly , nonlocal in space .",
    "its oscillatory dependence on the energy implies that upon energy averaging the main contribution comes from the diagonal part ( @xmath46 ) of the double sum ( [ doublesum ] ) .",
    "the approximation of a double sum by a single sum is called the `` diagonal approximation''@xcite .",
    "it does not take into account quantum interference corrections such as weak localization .",
    "however , according to our assumptions on the relation between the ehernfest time and the decay time of the system , these corrections can be neglected .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the construction of the diagonal sum of orbits involves an expansion of the actions around that of the orbit going from @xmath18 to @xmath19 namely : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the initial ( at point @xmath18 ) and the final ( at point @xmath19 ) momenta associated with the @xmath23-th orbit . similarly @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the initial and the final momenta associated with the @xmath42-th orbit .",
    "@xmath52 is the time which takes for the particle to travel along the @xmath23-th trajectory . using the above expansions for the actions in ( [ doublesum ] ) , the diagonal approximation yields @xmath53 substituting this result into ( [ pi1 ] ) and integrating over @xmath29 and @xmath54 we arrive at @xmath55 this formula expresses @xmath31 as a sum over the classical trajectories from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "the momenta @xmath26-functions restrict the initial and final momenta of the trajectories to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the diagonal sum ( [ pi2 ] ) can be calculated using the flowing sum rule@xcite ( proved in appendix b ) : @xmath58 here @xmath59 is a general function of the space points @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and the time @xmath62 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the initial and final phase - space points of the @xmath23-th trajectory , while @xmath65 is the corresponding period of the trajectory . finally , @xmath66 is the phase space trajectory of the system , as function of the time @xmath62 , starting from @xmath61 .",
    "this trajectory is the solution of hamilton s equations : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , with initial conditions @xmath69 . using ( [ sumrule ] ) to replace the sum over orbits in ( [ pi2 ] ) by an integral over the time we finally obtain @xmath70",
    "the function @xmath31 is the fourier transform of the classical propagator of the system for @xmath71 .",
    "it is the generalization of the `` diffuson '' of disordered systems to general chaotic systems .",
    "this analogy becomes clearer when projecting @xmath31 down to real space , i.e. integrating over @xmath72 and @xmath57 .",
    "the integration over @xmath73 is straightforward , and to integrate over @xmath72 we assume that @xmath74 , and that @xmath75 is independent of @xmath72 .",
    "this is good approximation for a diffusive motion on long time scales , since momentum relaxation is fast .",
    "thus @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the average density of states per unit volume .",
    "the function , @xmath78 , is the matrix element of the diffusion propagator between the position states @xmath79 and @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the diffusion constant . inserting a complete set of momentum states , which diagonalizes the propagator , and integrating over @xmath62 we arrive at formula for the diffuson of disordered systems : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the volume of the system .",
    "a spectral decomposition similar to ( [ diffusivespectral ] ) exists also for the classical propagator of general chaotic systems@xcite . in the time domain one formally has : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the poisson bracket operator of the classical system , @xmath87 are its eigenvalues , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the corresponding left and right eigenfunctions . the above spectral decomposition results from regularization of the classical dynamics . for instance , by keeping a finite width for the @xmath26-functions in ( [ pi3 ] ) and taking it to zero only after the diagonalization of the propagator .",
    "the resulting eigenvalues , called ruelle resonances , constitute the perron - frobenius spectrum of the classical system .",
    "all classical eigenvalues of open systems have positive real part .",
    "they appear either as purely real or in complex conjugate pairs , we denote this set of eigenvalues by @xmath90 , and order them according to the magnitude of their real parts , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .    in concluding this section we remark that complex eigenvalues of the classical propagator , @xmath93 , characterize ballistic chaotic systems .",
    "they emerge , for example , when typical classical trajectories spend long time near some short periodic orbit .",
    "this type of behavior does not appear in diffusive systems where classical relaxation is dominated by purely real eigenvalues . in section 4",
    "we demonstrate the manifestations of complex ruelle resonances in two examples .",
    "in this section we construct a diagrammatic scheme for calculating correlation functions such as the two - point function @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are some observables , and the averaging , @xmath97 , is over the `` center of mass '' energy @xmath20 . the energy interval over which this averaging takes place is sufficiently wide to contain a large number of resonances , but narrow enough so that the classical dynamics within this interval is approximately independent of the energy .",
    "the proposed diagrammatic scheme is a lift into phase space of the disordered diagrammatics which is embedded either in the momentum or real space .",
    "an important step in this direction is to express products of quantum observables in terms of their wigner representations which are functions of phase space variables .",
    "this issue will be considered in subsection a. next we calculate the one - point ( subsection b ) , and the two - point ( subsection c ) functions .",
    "finally ( subsection d ) , the results will be generalized to @xmath98-point functions by setting the diagram rules for their calculation .",

    "the wigner representation@xcite , @xmath102 of the operator @xmath95 is a function of the phase space variables @xmath9 .",
    "it is a faithful representation of the quantum operator , since all its matrix elements can be reconstructed from the inverse relation @xmath103 where @xmath104 . yet , expressed as a function on the classical phase space , the wigner representation is convenient for semiclassical expansions .    the external product of two operators @xmath105 , with matrix elements @xmath106 ,",
