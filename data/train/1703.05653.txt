    "<S> in this paper , we investigate the localization of a five - dimensional vector field on a pure geometrical thick brane . in previous work , it was shown that a free massless vector field can not be localized on such thick brane . </S>",
    "<S> hence we introduce the interaction between the vector field and the background scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> two types of couplings are constructed as examples . </S>",
    "<S> we get a typical volcano potential for the first type of coupling and a finite square - well - like potential for the second one . </S>",

    "<S> however , in the original rs model , the brane is very ideal because its thickness is neglected . in later work , by considering the minimum length scale of a brane , more natural thick branes generated by one or more background scalar fields have been investigated @xcite . in the brane world scenario , it is assumed that gravity is free to propagate in the bulk and the zero modes of all matter fields ( electromagnetic , yang - mills , fermions etc . ) </S>",
