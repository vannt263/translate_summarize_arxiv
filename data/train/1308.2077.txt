    "recent years have seen much progress in understanding the holographic duality between 3d vector - like theories and vasiliev s higher - spin gauge theories in 4d anti - de siter space ( ads@xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "has been identified as the large-@xmath4 limit of @xmath5 minimal models in two dimensions @xcite , and these theories have also been related to a string theory on @xmath6 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the status and applicability of the higher - spin realization of ds / cft correspondence has also been fleshed out @xcite . ] according to the klebanov - polyakov conjecture , the singlet operators of the 3d @xmath7 or @xmath8 vector model at large @xmath4 are dual to the vasiliev higher spin fields in the bulk ads@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the singlet constraint can be dynamically imposed by gauging the global symmetry and adding a chern - simons ( cs ) kinetic term for the gauge field @xcite .",
    "the singlet ( cs - gauged ) vector models constructed in this way are conjectured to be dual to the parity - violating vasiliev theory in ads@xmath2 .",
    "singlet vector models can also be studied on higher genus spatial surfaces @xcite . in particular , on a spatial torus , these theories contain a set of states whose energies scale as @xmath9 .",
    "these states are exactly degenerate at @xmath10 , which corresponds to a classical theory in the bulk .",
    "such light states arise due to the non - trivial dynamics of the cs theory on spaces with a non - trivial fundamental group @xcite ; they are not present in the vasiliev theories studied before , and remain mysterious from the bulk point of view .",
    "any bulk theory that is conjectured to be dual to the singlet vector model on the boundary should be able to accommodate these states .",
    "@xcite has recently made a very interesting proposal of the duality between supersymmetric versions of vasiliev theory in the bulk and bifundamental cs - matter theory on the boundary with a simply connected spatial manifold . in this paper",
    "we supplement their results by studying a simple , non - supersymmetric bifundamental cs - matter model in various spacetimes .",
    "we focus on a theory with the gauge group @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the levels of the @xmath13 csterms .",
    "the matter is a scalar field transforming in the bifundamental representation @xmath14 of the gauge group , and we work in the t hooft limit where we take @xmath4 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 to infinity while keeping @xmath17 and @xmath18 fixed . at @xmath19 ,",
    "the two regimes of interest are @xmath20 , corresponding to a finite @xmath15 , or @xmath21 , corresponding to the double - scaling limit described above . in the bulk , these two regimes map to regimes of zero and non - zero bulk t hooft coupling , respectively .",
    "group can be understood as a gauge group with gauge coupling @xmath9 .",
    "please see @xcite for further details . ] in the limit when @xmath22 is small the difference from the fundamental vector model with gauge group @xmath23 is expected to be small . to see finite-@xmath15 effects as @xmath22",
    "is taken to zero , one must keep track of @xmath24 corrections in the bifundamental computation , which we do not do in this paper .",
    "various aspects of cs theory coupled to fundamental matter have been studied in detail in @xcite . in section [ sec : feyn2loops ] we study , following @xcite , the non - supersymmetric cs theory coupled to bifundamental scalar matter .",
    "we compute the two - loop @xmath25-functions of the theory and find two lines of fixed points parametrized by the gauge coupling @xmath26 . in section [ sec : torus ] , following @xcite , we study the cs - bifundamental theories on a spatial torus .",
    "encouragingly , we find that there are no exactly degenerate states in the t hooft limit . instead , we find that the gap is proportional to @xmath22 , when @xmath22 is small , and along the way we develop a straightforward diagrammatic way of arranging the perturbation theory in @xmath22 .",
    "finally , in the concluding section , we point out how these results suggest that bifundamental theories can be used to regulate fundamental matter theories by tuning the ratio @xmath22 of the two ranks in a bifundamental theory . on a spatial torus , by changing @xmath22 one",
    "tunes the mass of the gauge field holonomies and , at @xmath27 , transitions into a phase that looks like the fundamental theory ( i.e.  the singlet vector model ) on a torus .",
    "this indicates that the heretofore mysterious modification of vasiliev theory that can accommodate for the light states found in @xcite should be attainable as a particular limit of the bulk theory studied in @xcite .",
    "a note on conventions is in order .",
    "the two papers on which our analysis rests , @xcite and @xcite , employ different conventions and have slightly different actions . in order to be able to check that our computations correctly reduce to the results of these two papers , we work with different actions in different sections of this paper ; in each section we follow the conventions of its guiding reference .",
    "we consider an @xmath0 euclidean cs theory coupled to scalars in the bifundamental representation @xmath14 . without loss of generality we will take @xmath28 .",
    "the partition function of our theory is and the action that contains all the marginal terms is the covariant derivative is the bifundamental scalar , @xmath29 , is an @xmath30 matrix transforming as @xmath31 for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are hermitian connections transforming as @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the traces @xmath38 are taken in the fundamental representations of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "lie algebra conventions and the feynman rules stemming from this action are collected in appendix [ sec : feynrules ] .    in this section",
    "we perform the fixed point analysis of the t hooft limit perturbatively in @xmath17 .",
    "we work to two - loop order , closely following the work of @xcite .",
    "the cs coupling @xmath41 is quantized and does not run under rg flows ; hence we only need to compute the @xmath25-functions for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "these are found by computing the two - loop amplitude when all external momenta are zero . at tree level , this amplitude is given by , once loop corrections are introduced , the amplitude must be regulated by counterterms @xmath45 multiplying the above tensor structures .",
    "these counterterms depend on the subtraction scale @xmath46 and can be used to extract the @xmath25-functions @xmath47 of all three couplings",
    ". we will use dimensional reduction dimensions , and so the standard dimensional regularization can not be applied to cs - matter theories .",
    "instead , one uses the dimensional reduction scheme where the tensor algebra appearing in the feynman integrals is done in three dimensions and then the resulting scalar integral is analytically continued to general space dimensions .",
    "this preserves gauge invariance at least up to two loops .",
    "see @xcite for details . ] to regulate the uv divergences , and we will work in the minimal subtraction scheme .     +    despite the apparent complexity of this computation , aharony et al .  have shown that , remarkably , only eight diagrams need to be computed when dealing with fundamental cs - matter to two - loop order @xcite . was mistakenly concluded to be zero for @xmath8 , based on the findings in @xcite .",
    "we thank guy gur - ari and raghu mahajan for extensive discussions that have clarified this issue . ]",
    "the same argument goes through for bifundamental cs - matter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn2loop ] ) .",
    "the additional complication in our case is the existence of two gauge fields and two additional multi - trace scalar six - point couplings , so each diagram in the fundamental matter theory can be thought to generate a number of related diagrams in the bifundamental theory , each with the same momentum structure but with different index contractions and multiplicity .",
    "these are all straightforward to enumerate and compute .",
    "the feynman rules are given in appendix [ sec : feynrules ] , and applying them gives    the quantities @xmath48 label the dimensionally regulated momentum space integrals , which evaluate to now we can switch to the t hooft couplings , and find that the counterterms are given by    as a rudimentary check , we notice that taking @xmath49 makes the contributions to @xmath50 from diagrams ( a2 ) and ( a3 ) exactly cancel , leaving diagram ( a1 ) as the only process contributing to the @xmath25-function for @xmath51 ; the same non - trivial cancellation occurs in the fundamental cs - matter model .",
    "moreover , in this limit , the counterterms are all the same , and are given by this is precisely the leading @xmath4 behavior found in @xcite .",
    "this is expected , as each of the three traces in the action should collapse to the usual six - point term for fundamental matter , @xmath52 , and so all three couplings @xmath53 should flow in the same way .",
    "the field strength renormalization can be found by computing two - loop corrections to @xmath54 .",
    "these are given by four diagrams on fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn2loopz ] , and these are regulated by the following counterterms @xcite : the total counterterm needed , expressed in terms of t hooft couplings , is this result precisely reduces to the leading @xmath4 result found in @xcite when @xmath49 .",
    "+    the @xmath25-functions , @xmath55 , are now found using standard methods . in dimensional reduction ( regularization ) , the scale independence of the bare six - point couplings requires that this is the renormalization group equation . differentiating through and setting @xmath56 ( the cs coupling runs with the scale in @xmath57 dimensions ) , we find knowing that the counterterms are all quadratic or quartic functions of the couplings simplifies these expressions down to substituting the counterterms and finally yields    in agreement with @xcite , we find that the @xmath25-functions all become suppressed when @xmath49 . at finite @xmath22 , we find two lines of fixed points parametrized by @xmath26 and given by these two lines of fixed points are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : fixedpoints ] .",
    "+    we have found this two - loop fixed line in the large-@xmath4 limit , but our analysis holds for any value of the fixed ratio @xmath18 .",
    "it will be interesting to see if this holds to all - loop order , at least in the large-@xmath4 limit .",
    "we can see that as the t hooft coupling goes to zero the fixed points approach the trivial value zero , which is consistent with the fact that that the model has no fixed points in the absence of the cs term .",
    "it is easy to see that , at both fixed point lines , the sign of the @xmath58 coupling is opposite that of the other two couplings .",
    "both lines could be stable . to answer that question one has to compute the coleman - weinberg potential and see if the potential is bounded from below for the specific values of the coupling constants .",
    "we will not try to do that in this paper , but an argument may be given which shows that there is no tachyonic mode  at least for small values of the t hooft coupling @xmath26 .",
    "for example , one could compute the self - energy of the scalar field and look for unphysical poles . in our case the self - energy at least up to two - loop order does not get any contribution from the six - point couplings , and so there can not be a tachyonic pole caused by the negative coupling constants of the six - point interactions .",
    "in addition , the conformal symmetry may be spontaneously broken .",
    "for example , the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken in the vector model with only a @xmath59 interaction and no cs term , if the coupling constant @xmath60 is greater than @xmath61 .",
    "it will be interesting to compute the coleman - weinberg potential and study this spontaneous breaking , but we leave that for future research .",
    "in this section we change gears and study the low - energy , small-@xmath26 limit of the cs - bifundamental theory on the torus in a spacetime with lorentzian signature . our goal is to retrieve the spectrum of the theory ; our methods closely follow those in @xcite .",
    "we will see that this spectrum has no state whose energy vanishes in the t hooft limit . in principle , one should study the full bifundamental theory with its potential terms . instead , we will study the toy theory with only the cs terms and the covariant kinetic terms for the scalar field .",
    "this captures the essential physics at small t hooft coupling and at energy low compared to the inverse size ( kk scale ) of the spatial torus .      as usual , we canonically quantize in the gauge @xmath62 , where @xmath63 denotes the time component .",
    "we are interested in low - energy degrees of freedom only , and so we disregard the spatially varying ( non - zero momentum ) modes of all of the fields , as these necessarily have a gap set by the size of the torus .",
    "this is just dimensional reduction onto a single spatial point ; naturally , the dimensionally reduced theory is just a form of quantum mechanics .",
    "its lagrangian can be written as note that the minus signs in the @xmath64 terms come from our choice of the metric convention ( mostly minus ) . from here on , we treat all variables ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath29 , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) as matrices of c- or q - numbers , and we drop the indices on the traces .",
    "moreover , to compactify notation , we write the sum of traces as a trace of a sum , even when the matrices in this sum are not all of the same dimension .    in @xcite , a simpler version of this model  the one arising from the theory of fundamental scalars coupled to one gauge field",
    " was studied by canonical quantization , treating the @xmath69 term perturbatively in @xmath9 .",
    "this method readily gives the spectrum of the theory , and we will follow the same approach here . we will also develop a formal justification for using perturbation theory .    letting @xmath70 , we choose the canonical variables defined by we use @xmath71 , @xmath72 , etc .  to denote generators of @xmath39 , and @xmath73 , @xmath25 , etc .  to denote generators of @xmath40 .",
    "the hamiltonian is with    it is useful to switch to variables that will give the ladder operators upon quantization , and so we let the hamiltonian becomes notice that the choice of a negative level for the @xmath40 cs action translates into the last term of the hamiltonian above .",
    "this term allows for simultaneous creation of @xmath39 and @xmath40 holonomies . in other words ,",
    "the conserved quantum number of `` particles '' created by the @xmath74 s and @xmath75 s will be the difference ( rather than the sum ) of numbers of `` particles '' of each species .",
    "to quantize the holonomy degrees of freedom , we impose using @xmath76 for @xmath39 ( or for any simple group ) and likewise for @xmath40 , the normal - ordered hamiltonian becomes and we see that the scalar fields will acquire a mass due to the vacuum energy of the holonomies .",
    "this mass is set by    the mass of the holonomy excitations will be set by the vacuum energy of the scalar excitations , and to find it we must quantize the scalars as well .",
    "we let where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are , respectively , @xmath30 and @xmath77 q - number matrices .",
    "the conjugation operation @xmath78 acts on such a matrix by transposing it and taking a hermitian conjugate of each q - number element .",
    "we impose cannonical commutation relations on each of the @xmath79 elements of @xmath71 or @xmath72 , and so instead of the standard cyclicity of the trace we have similarly , for an @xmath80 matrix @xmath81 , we find and , for an @xmath82 matrix @xmath83 , these identities allow us to find the normal - ordered form of the hamiltonian , which is where , using @xmath84 ,      the spectrum is now easily found using perturbation theory .",
    "we shift the ground state energy to zero and choose the unperturbed hamiltonian to be this hamiltonian can be exactly diagonalized in the t hooft limit .",
    "the hilbert space is spanned by the standard sho eigenstates of the quadratic part of @xmath85 , and we will later show that the quartic term merely provides a correction to some of the eigenenergies .",
    "hence , we will from now on adopt the usual language of creation / annihilation operators .",
    "the term that we have to treat perturbatively , @xmath86 , is where @xmath87 is defined in eq .  .",
    "we have already disregarded the terms proportional to the traces of group generators , as these are zero for the case at hand .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian contains a mass term for the holonomy degrees of freedom . for any gauge group , one set of holonomy excitations",
    "has a bare mass of @xmath88 . as bare masses .",
    "] in our case , the generators @xmath89 are in the fundamental representation of @xmath39 , for which @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in the t hooft limit ( @xmath92 while @xmath93 and @xmath94 are held fixed ) the bare mass is we approach the regime of cs coupled to fundamental matter by taking @xmath95 , and in this limit the holonomy states become light , as found in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the states of the other holonomy have bare mass @xmath96 , and in the t hooft limit this is these states remain massive as we approach the fundamental representation by letting @xmath22 become @xmath24 .",
    "the physical eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian must be invariant under the remaining @xmath97 gauge transformations .",
    "thus , if @xmath98 is the vacuum of the theory , @xmath99 is not a physical state , but @xmath100 is , and so is any state created by a gauge - invariant combination of creation operators .",
    "is not physical because the generators of @xmath39 are traceless . ]",
    "the operators we consider transform as ( recall that @xmath101 and @xmath102 are @xmath103 and @xmath104 matrices , while @xmath105 is @xmath77 and @xmath106 is @xmath107 . )",
    "the following single - trace operators are all gauge - invariant : the vectors @xmath108 and @xmath109 have @xmath110 components each , and it is understood that permuting the entries of either one does not generate a physically new state .",
    "furthermore , due to the relations between traces of matrix powers , not all single - trace operators are independent .",
    "for instance , out of the holonomy degrees of freedom , only @xmath111 and @xmath112 are independent ; the others can all be written as multi - trace combinations of these operators .",
    "the interdependence of these operators is a finite-@xmath4 or high - energy effect , and it will not figure in our analysis of the low - energy spectrum .",
    "the states created by these operators must all have unit norm . in the t hooft limit",
    ", one can check that the correct normalization is above we use @xmath113 to denote the `` symmetry factor , '' with @xmath114 if @xmath115 and @xmath116 for all @xmath117 , and with @xmath118 otherwise .",
    "these normalizations can be derived using planar diagram techniques that we will introduce below , and then we will also explain why one may think of each gauge boson as contributing a factor of @xmath119 or @xmath120 to the normalization of a state , while each pair of scalar excitations contributes @xmath121 .",
    "we will now demonstrate that the states , , and are approximate eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath85 , given by .",
    "focus on the action of the quartic terms on these states .",
    "each of the quartic terms annihilates any @xmath122 or @xmath123 , so states formed from purely gauge excitations have unperturbed masses equal to their bare masses .",
    "( the lightest state in the spectrum , @xmath124 , falls in this group , and has bare / unperturbed energy @xmath125 . )",
    "similarly , states @xmath126 with only matter excitations preserve their bare mass once the quartics in @xmath85 are introduced .",
    "all other states will be non - trivial eigenstates of the quartic operators in @xmath85 , at least at large @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , @xmath127 is an exact eigenstate of @xmath85 .",
    "a short computation shows that similarly , @xmath127 is an eigenstate of @xmath128 with the same eigenvalue , and so    in general , it is true that and the @xmath9 corrections come from the multi - trace operators generated by the action of the quartics on some of the @xmath129 states .",
    "for instance , take @xmath130 and @xmath131 ; we find where we use @xmath132 to denote the normalization of the state created by @xmath133 , as shown in eqs .  , , and .",
    "the second term has an @xmath134 coefficient that is negligible in the t hooft limit .",
    "the upshot of these calculations is that the unperturbed hamiltonian at large @xmath4 and @xmath15 has the same eigenstates as the quadratic , sho hamiltonian , with unperturbed energies      the remaining quartic couplings , assembled in , can be treated perturbatively .",
    "we wish to find corrections @xmath135 to energies of the non - degenerate eigenstates of @xmath85 .",
    "calculating @xmath135 s at @xmath136 can in principle be done by the usual methods of quantum - mechanical perturbation theory . however , studying all possible contractions between traces quickly becomes a very involved task .",
    "we will now show that , fortunately , perturbative calculations drastically simplify by using a diagrammatic technique that automatically keeps track of index contractions in expressions like @xmath137 .",
    "we do not rederive quantum mechanical perturbation theory ; we merely note that known expressions for perturbative corrections can be efficiently encoded using diagrams .",
    "the `` feynman rules '' for computing energy corrections are as follows :    1 .",
    "the perturbatively corrected energy @xmath138 of a state @xmath139 can be represented as a feynman diagram computation of the self - energy of this state .",

    "finally , and most importantly , write down the factors of @xmath4 and @xmath15 that come from internal indices that got contracted",

    "it is important to note that we use the double - line notation only to count the relevant powers of @xmath4 and @xmath15 and _ not _ to find all possible diagrams and compute them ; if we applied the typical double - line analysis of t hooft , we would end up computing diagrams that do not represent processes in perturbation theory .",
    "these rules allow for a quick estimate of the size of the effect of each order in perturbation theory .",

    "on the other hand , a connected diagram in double - line notation can only have up to @xmath110 loops in total .- lines and a pair of @xmath15-lines .",
    "there are no loops involving just one vertex allowed by the theory , so each vertex must pair up with at least one more vertex to give a loop .",
    "thus , there can be no more than one loop per vertex .",
    "] any diagrams with fewer than @xmath110 loops will be suppressed in the t hooft limit , so they may be discarded .",

    "thus , perturbation theory gives an expansion in powers of @xmath160 , with perturbations of orders @xmath161 and @xmath157 both being suppressed by @xmath162 .",
    "this shows that perturbation theory is well - defined at low energies ( where the @xmath9 corrections can not be compensated for by pure combinatorics , i.e.  where @xmath163 ) . in particular , in the case of fundamental matter",

    "the rules above are a bit formal and perhaps unintuitive .",
    "as already mentioned , the double - line formalism can be used to simply derive the normalizations of physical states , as given in eqs .  - . as an illustration of our diagrammatic approach",
    " and as a means of justifying the specifics of our feynman rules  we now derive these normalizations and explain the origin of the symmetry factors @xmath113 .",

    ", we find that there are precisely @xmath113 planar diagrams , where @xmath113 is the symmetry factor introduced earlier .",
    "only these diagrams need be taken into account .",
    "there are no vertices , intermediate states , or internal gauge boson contractions , so each diagram is just given a value of @xmath168 as per rule 5 .",
    "the symmetry factors cancel each other out , and this shows that the way we have defined the symmetry factor and feynman rules precisely ensures that each gauge - invariant state is normalized .",
    "the second expectation value is a vacuum amplitude , and the normalization factor is given as the inverse square root of this amplitude .",
    "now @xmath164 acts as an interaction term , and all it does is insert a vertex that creates all the particles in @xmath167 with their indices properly contracted in the past . the diagram giving @xmath169 can be drawn by using the diagram for @xmath170 , focusing on the external states , and connecting all adjacent lines in the double - line notation , with the first line being connected to the last one .",
    "these connections correspond to index contractions as they appear in the trace .",
    "each boson contraction is now an internal one , and this accounts for the factors of two appearing in the normalization .",
    "each incoming particle now also gives rise to a loop ( in the t hooft limit ) , and these account for the factors of @xmath4 and @xmath15 in the normalization .",
    "( in particular , our heuristic @xmath4-counting is justified ; each pair of @xmath71 and @xmath72 matter particles contributes @xmath79 to the vacuum amplitude , each @xmath140 boson contributes @xmath4 , and each @xmath141 boson contributes @xmath15 . ) finally , it is now apparent that there can be only @xmath113 diagrams that contribute at leading order in @xmath4 ; only diagrams that are planar or that can be made planar by cyclic permutations contribute , and there are exactly @xmath113 of these . in short , we conclude that the vacuum amplitude is where the @xmath171 s count the number of @xmath101 s , @xmath102 s , and @xmath172 pairs in @xmath164 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath173 is thus precisely what has been stated in eqs .  .",
    "as an application of interest for studying the low - energy behavior of the system , we now show how the diagrammatic rules above can be used to calculate the first correction to the gap of the system .",
    "the ground state only receives corrections from disconnected ( bubble ) diagrams . as usual",
    ", these do not affect the gap calculation ; they merely renormalize the ground state energy which we may always shift to zero .",
    "( this is why we only need to compute connected diagrams , as per rule 2 . )",
    "thus , we take @xmath174 .",
    "the only corrections to the gap come from the corrections to @xmath156 , the energy of the first excited state .    the state @xmath124 has energy @xmath175 , and so the unperturbed gap is the first order corrections is trivially the second order correction is non - trivial , and hence we resort to the feynman rules developed in the previous section .    we have already argued that @xmath176 scales like @xmath22 , and is hence of the same order as the unperturbed energy .",
    "the diagrams contributing up to second order in perturbation theory are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : feyndiag ] .",
    "the zero - vertex term is just the unperturbed energy @xmath177 .",
    "the second order term in perturbation theory ( i.e.  the sum of two - vertex diagrams ) is calculated following our diagrammatic rules .",
    "each of the two two - vertex diagrams has one @xmath4-loop , one @xmath15-loop , one gauge boson contraction , and two vertices .",
    "the intermediate state is in both cases @xmath178 , with @xmath118 and @xmath179 , while the in- and out - states have @xmath180 .",
    "hence , the two - vertex contribution , or the second order term in perturbation theory , is we are working up to first order in @xmath22 , and in this regime the second - order - corrected gap is higher order corrections can be found in a similarly straightforward way .",
    "note that this answer reduces to the answer for cs - fundamental on a torus when @xmath49 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the chern - simons theory coupled to bifundamental scalar fields . at two - loop order , in the t hooft limit , the theory has two lines of fixed points parametrized by the t hooft coupling .",
    "these lines exist for all values of the fixed ratio @xmath3 .",
    "when this ratio is zero the theory goes over to the cs theory coupled to the fundamental matter which has a dual description in terms of a parity - violating version of the vasiliev higher - spin gauge theory in @xmath181 .",
    "when the ratio is small the dual gravitational theory should be some deformation of the vasiliev theory , as has been conjectured in @xcite . when this ratio approaches unity , the field theory is some kind of a non - supersymmetric version of the abjm theory .",
    "the dual gravitational theory should be an einstein gravity theory in the large t hooft coupling limit",
    ". it will be fascinating to better understand this bosonic theory in the bulk .",
    "we have also studied the low - lying spectrum of this theory placed on a torus .",
    "cs theory coupled to fundamental matter has a set of low lying states whose energy goes like @xmath154 and so in the strict classical limit , @xmath10 , they are exactly degenerate zero energy states .",
    "our analysis shows that the bifundamental matter has no such states on the torus .",
    "the energy in this case goes like @xmath182 for small value of @xmath3 , and this gap stays nonzero even when @xmath10 .",
    "this is encouraging and leads to the picture where one can think of the bifundamental theory as a regulator of the fundamental theory which regulates the singular low - energy states of the fundamental theory on a torus whose bulk dual is still mysterious .",
    "let us now place the theory on a genus @xmath183 riemann surface , @xmath184 .",
    "the number of states in the hilbert space of pure cs theory on @xmath185 with gauge group @xmath8 and level @xmath16 goes like @xmath186 for large @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "so , for the bifundamental theory , this will go like @xmath187 .",
    "these states have exactly zero energy in the pure cs theory",
    ". it will be very interesting to know the fate of these large number of exactly degenerate states once we add matter to it .",
    "if we add fundamental matter , then the degeneracy is not lifted at least in the very weakly coupled regime . however , for the bifundamental matter things could be different .",
    "we saw in the case of torus that adding bifundamental matter lifts the degeneracy of pure cs states even in the classical limit in the bulk .",
    "the same thing could happen for higher genus surfaces and if this is the case then it will be fascinating .",
    "we leave this question for future study .",
    "we have left untouched many important things in this paper .",
    "for example , we have not provided any argument for the all - loop existence of the fixed line .",
    "one can also compute the anomalous dimensions of the operators , and it is known that the currents acquire non - zero anomalous dimensions in the bifundamental theory .",
    "it would be good to have an expression for that as a function of the t hooft coupling and the fixed ratio @xmath3 .",
    "another important thing is to compute the free energy of this theory .",
    "it will give us a wealth of information about the bulk gravity theory , in particular about black holes in the bulk .",
    "in passing we would like to mention that the bifundamental fermions coupled to cs gauge theory may be simpler in this respect , because by standard arguments the fermionic theory is a conformal field theory for all values of the t hooft coupling and the ratio @xmath3 .",
    "we have not touched upon the issue of duality @xcite in these bifundamental theories .",
    "for that one has to study the scalar and fermion theories in much more detail . we leave that for future research .",
    "we would like to thank shiraz minwalla for suggesting this problem and eric perlmutter for comments on the previous version of the paper .",
    "we would also like to thank guy gur - ari , raghu mahajan , shiraz minwalla , xiao - liang qi , and steve shenker for valuable discussions .",
    "we would also like to thank steve shenker for useful comments on the draft .",
    "the work of r was supported by the stanford institute for theoretical physics ( sitp ) and an nsf graduate research fellowship .",
    "the research of sb is supported by nsf grant 0756174 and the sitp .",
    "the action of the cs - bifundamental theory is given by eq .  .",
    "the feynman rules are easily obtained if the notation is decompactified and all indices are explicitly written .",
    "this gives as elsewhere in the text , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath140 , etc .",

    "we have defined the cs coupling rescaled all the gauge fields by @xmath191 , and defined in this paper , consistently with the choice of the cs action in section [ sec : feyn2loops ] and following @xcite , we choose where the latter equality for @xmath192 comes as a special case of the choice the feynman rules can now be read off .",
    "the propagators are : note that the gluon propagators must be assigned a direction .",
    "taking into account the overall minus sign from the boltzmann factor @xmath193 , the vertices are found to be : these can be depicted using a variant of the usual double - line notation with two types of lines .",

    "this notation has the usual advantage of allowing one to quickly estimate which diagrams dominate in the t hooft limit .",
