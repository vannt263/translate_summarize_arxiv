    "the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies ( egs ) is very important for understanding galaxies formation and evolution , but several key issues are still open questions .",
    "early studies regarded egs as a family of galaxies that has very simple properties : smooth morphology ; old stellar population ; red optical color ; free of cold gas and young star formation ( searle , sargent & bagnuolo 1973 ; larson 1975 ) . however , recent observations suggest that this viewpoint is really oversimple for egs .",
    "astronomers already detected cold gas and dust and even recent / residual star formation in egs ( morganti et al .",
    "2006 ; yi et al . 2005 ; kaviraj et al . 2007 ;",
    "see also the recent review by sarzi et al .",
    "fukugita et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reported four star - forming egs from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr2 , where the star formation rate can be comparable with normal spiral galaxies . with a much larger sample of 16,000 early - type galaxies , schawinski et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that about @xmath1 early type galaxies show ongoing star formation , this fraction is based on emission lines , but the fraction of these active elliptical or early - type galaxies is actually highly dependent on the data and the galaxy mass ( see schawinski et.al .",
    "2006 , 2007b ) .",
    "for example , with nuv data from galex , this fraction could be as high as 30% ( kaviraj et.al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the detection of active star - forming egs provides a severe challenge for galaxy formation and evolution model .",
    "there are two main competing formation scenarios for egs : the _ monolithic collapse _ model and the _ hierarchical merger _ model . in the early monolithic collapse model , egs formed from the violent starburst happened at very high redshift and evolved passively ever since then ( eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ; larson 1974 ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; bressan , chiosi & fagotto 1994 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the hierarchical merger model considers a more extended formation history . in this model ,",
    "the egs are formed from the major merger of disc galaxies of similar mass ( toomre 1977 ; white & rees 1978 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ) .",
    "both these models can explain some aspects of observed data and face some unavoidable problems at the same time : the _ monolithic collapse _ model is supported by the existence and the tightness of scaling relation like color - magnitude relation ( cmr)(sandage & visvanathan 1978 ) , fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ) and mg2-@xmath2 relation ( colless et al .",
    "1999 , kuntschner et al .",
    "2001 ) in egs , but can not explain the active star - formation and remarkable cold gas found in egs . for the _ hierarchical merger _ model ,",
    "now there are lots of observational evidence that demonstrates the importance of interaction and merger in the formation of early - type galaxies and it is expected by the most popular @xmath3-cdm cosmology .",
    "more and more recent observations indicate that some field egs could be formed at relative low redshift and the stellar populations can spread widely , which also support the _ hierarchical merger _ model . but the observed `` down - sizing '' effect ( kodama et al .",
    "2004 ; cimatti , daddi & renzini 2006 ) is not consistent with the _ hierarchical merger _ model , which predicts that the most massive egs should be formed most recently .",
    "although from recent simulations , this `` down - sizing '' behaviour also could be obtained within the hierarchical model ( de lucia et.al .",
    "these two models predict totally different star formation history ( sfh ) for egs , and the recent star formation activity can be an important tracer of sfh in egs .",
    "the time - scale and intensity of the recent star - formation , and the triggering mechanism contain important information on sfhs , which can be used to test egs formation scenario .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to obtain the stellar population properties of different types of egs ( e.g. , star - forming and quiescent galaxies ) and to shed light into the difference and connection in their sfhs .",
    "we thus select a sample of local egs with reliable morphology classification from the sloan digital sky survey ; then different methods of stellar population analysis are used to derive the properties of their stellar populations .",
    "this paper is organized as following .",
    "section 2 describes the sample selection and data reduction in this work . in section 3",
    ", we describe the process of stellar population analysis and the method of emission line diagnostic , and section 4 presents the main results , including the basic properties of the sample and the information about their stellar population . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the implication of the results in the context of elliptical galaxies evolution , section 6 is the conclusion .    throughout this paper , we assume the @xmath3cdm cosmology consistent with the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) results with @xmath4 and @xmath5(spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) and magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "the sample is extracted from fukugita et al .",
    "( 2007 ; f07 ) , which provided a catalog of morphologically classified galaxies in a region ( @xmath6 230 @xmath7 ) of the northern sky ( @xmath8 ) . in this area",
    ", there are 2658 photometric objects with r - band petrosian magnitude brighter than 16 mag ( e.g. , @xmath9 mag ) in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( gunn et al .",
    "1998 ; blanton et al . 2003 ) , among of which , 1866 have spectroscopic information . from the spectroscopic sample ,",
    "487 galaxies which are classified as e - e / s0 ( @xmath10 ) are selected to be the sample of this work .",
    "these 487 galaxies have both photometrical and spectroscopic informations in the sdss database .    in order to examine the statistical completeness , fukugita et al .",
    "( 2007 ) compared the number of galaxies as a function of r - band magnitude with the n@xmath6@xmath11 , which is expected for the euclidean geometry , and found that the completeness for the sample is pretty good and does not miss too many galaxies even in the bright end of 10 @xmath1210.5 mag . for the spectroscopic sample ,",
    "the completeness remains good for @xmath13 mag , which means we might miss some bright galaxies .",
    "the number count of the sample egs as a function of r - band petrosian magnitude , r - band absolute magnitude and redshift are shown in fig 1 .    among these 487 galaxies ,",
    "269 are classified as @xmath14 and the others have @xmath15 , whose morphological type is e / s0 . after examining the g - band images of all these 487 galaxies , it is very difficult to tell the difference between e and s0 galaxies by eye .",
    "however , we find that e / s0 ( t=0.5 ) galaxies have somewhat smaller minor / major axis ratio than egs ( t=0 ) galaxies , some e / s0s have a very bright nucleus .",
    "but , in general , these two sub - samples are basically similar in the morphology , so all 487 galaxies are taken as the eg sample , although it may introduce contamination of s0 galaxies .",
    "the visual classification is really important for our work , because the correspondence between colour and morphology is complex ( lintott et.al .",
    "2008 ) and only the visual classification of elliptical galaxies has no bias towards the ones with relative red color and without emission line .        the petrosian magnitude , petrosian radius ( r50 , r90 ) and other photometric informations of five bands ( _ u , g , r , i , z _ ) ( fukugita et al . 1996 ; gunn et al . 1998 ) are extracted from the sdss database .",
    "the sdss spectrum is obtained with a 3-arcsec fiber , covers the spectral range of 3800 to 9200   with the spectral resolution of @xmath61800 . the typical signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for our egs is 40 .",
    "the flux of emission lines , 25 lick / ids absorption line indices and corresponding errors are retrieved from the value - added galaxies catalog of sdss provided by the mpa / jhu team .",
    "the lick indices are measured under the original sdss resolution and corrected for contamination of sky emission lines .",
    "in order to explore the sfh of egs , we apply the stellar population synthesis code , ` starlight`(cid fernandes et al .",
    "2005 , mateus et al . 2006 ; cid fernandes et al .",
    "2007 ; asari et al . 2007 ) , for egs in our sample .",
    "the code is based on fitting an observed spectrum @xmath16 with a linear combination of simple theoretical stellar populations computed from evolutionary synthesis models ( cid fernandes et al .",
    "the model spectrum is given by :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the model spectrum , @xmath19 is the synthesis flux at the normalization wavelength , @xmath20 is the so - called _ population vector _",
    ", @xmath21 is the _ _ j__th ssp spectrum at @xmath22 and @xmath23 represents the reddening term . at the end ,",
    "the @xmath24 is the line - of - sight stellar motions that is modelled by a gaussian distribution centered at velocity @xmath25 and with velocity dispersion @xmath26 . in this work ,",
    "the model ssps are from the bc03 evolutionary synthesis models(bruzual & charlot 2003)which have about the same spectral resolution of sdss .",
    "the model base follows the work of seagal group which is made up of @xmath27@xmath28 ssps  6 metallicities ( z=0.005 , 0.02 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 1 and 2.5 @xmath29 ) ] and 25 ages ( from 1myr to 18 gyr ) . the spectra were computed with chabrier ( 2003 ) imf , padova 1994 models and the stelib library ( le borgne et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the intrinsic reddening is modeled by the foreground dust model , using the extinction law of cardelli , claytion & mathis ( 1989 ) with @xmath30 .    before fitting , the spectra",
    "are shifted to the rest frame and corrected for the galactic extinction according to the maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) and cardelli , claytion & mathis ( 1989 ) extinction law , then they are rebinned into 1  from 3600 to 8600   and the spectral regions of strong emission lines and bad pixels are masked .",
    "2 and 3 show examples of spectral fits for two egs in our sample .",
    "the top panel shows the observed spectrum ( black ) and the model ( red ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the residual spectrum and the masked regions are plotted with the pink line .",
    "these two examples demonstrate that the fitting method can reproduce spectrum of egs to an excellent degree of accuracy .",
    "` starlight ` presents the fraction of each stellar component , the intrinsic extinction @xmath31 , the velocity dispersion @xmath26 , and the current stellar mass @xmath32 . following cid fernandes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we could derive the flux- and mass - weighted average ages , which are defined as :    @xmath33    where @xmath20 is the _ population vector _ ( the fraction of flux contributed by certain ssp ) and    @xmath34    the @xmath35 is the fraction of stellar mass contributed by each ssp . the flux- and mass - weighted average metallicities ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) are derived in the same way .",
    "in the previous work , such as fukugita et al . ( 2004 ) ; zhao et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and * schawinski et al . ( 2007 , hereafter s07 ) * , several egs have been detected with residual star - forming activities . in order to isolate weak agns , egs are classified by emission lines according to their ionization states estimated from the flux ratios ( * baldwin , philips & terlevich 1981 * ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) .",
    "the emission line ratios used are [ o iii]@xmath225007 /h@xmath38 , [ n ii]@xmath226583/h@xmath0 , [ sii]@xmath226716 + 6731/h@xmath0  and [ o i]@xmath226300 /h@xmath0 . following the s / n criterion of kauffmann et al .",

    "* the fraction of egs with obvious emission lines , which are defined as egs have s / n@xmath39 for all four lines in the first bpt diagram , is @xmath40 . * for comparison ,",

    "all the other egs which are not satisfied our s / n criteria are classified as the quiescent egs , although , it should be noticed that the fraction of egs have s / n(h@xmath0)@xmath39 ( 54.8% ) is much higher than the fraction of egs used for bpt diagrams , which means among the quiescent egs , many of them could have very low level of activity such as agn or recent star formation and may be compatible with the retired galaxy model proposed recently by stasinska et.al .",
    "also , it should be mentioned that the composite egs are classified only from the first emission line diagnostic diagram in fig.4 .",
    "the absorption line indices are also used here for the study of the stellar properties of egs .",
    "the most widely used system is the lick / ids system ( worthey et al .",
    "1994 , worthey and ottaviani , 1997 , trager et al .",
    "1998 ) , which defines 25 indices including both atomic features ( e.g h@xmath38 , ca4227 , fe5270 ) and molecular bands ( e.g mg , cn , tio ) .",
    "the lick / ids indices and corresponding errors are retrieved from the mpa / jhu garching dr4 vagc as mentioned before .",
    "the measurements are performed under the original sdss spectral resolution . following the equations from kuntschner ( 2004 )",
    ", we corrected the effect of velocity dispersion broadening .",
    "it s worth noting that such measurement does not satisfy the requirement of lick / ids system as mentioned by worthey et al .",
    "so the results here will not be compared with the previous works based on lick / ids system .",
    "however , by using lick / ids indices , we can explore relationships between the properties of different type of egs and verify the validity of the results from ` starlight ` fitting .",
    "e+a galaxies were first discovered by dressler & gunn ( 1983 ; 1992 ) during the research of distant galactic clusters , which show strong balmer absorption lines ( a - type stars ) and no emission lines ( [ o]ii @xmath223727 ) just like the spectra of normal egs .",
    "the strong balmer absorption lines reveal recent starburst which happened in about 1 gyr ( due to the lifetime of a - type stars ) . so the e+a galaxies are often considered as the post - starburst galaxies ( kaviraj et al .",
    "2007 ; yang et al . 2008 ) . in some work , * such galaxies",
    "are also called as k+as ( franx 1993 , dressler et.al .",
    "1999 ) due to the presence of an old component in the galaxy spectra , resembling a k star spectrum .",
    "* although many k+a galaxies have disc - like morphology , goto et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that e+a galaxies with higher completeness from sdss dr5 generally have etg - like morphology .",
    "the e+a galaxies with etg- or eg morphology could possibly be the progenitors of normal egs and can tell us some undiscovered information about the evolution of egs .    according to the recent works of large sample of e+a galaxies like goto et al .",
    "( 2007a , 2007b , 2008 ) and helmboldt et al .",
    "( 2008 , k+a ) , the selection criteria are : 1 ) the ( @xmath43a ) index has value @xmath44 , 2 ) ew([oii]@xmath223727)@xmath45 , and 3 ) ew(h@xmath0)@xmath46 . generally speaking ,",
    "these criteria are looser compared with the ones by goto ( 2007 ) , howerer since the ew(h@xmath0 ) is included , there will be no contamination from h@xmath0 emission galaxies and the classification of e+a egs in our sample is reliable .",
    "by using the emission line ratios , we classify egs with emission lines into agns and star - forming galaxies .",
    "the bpt diagnostic diagrams are shown in fig.4 and the statistical results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the effective classification is mostly according to the first and the second diagrams .",
    "the solid lines represent the criteria from kewley et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the red dot line in the first diagram is a more rigorous criterion from stasinska et al .",
    "when we use this criterion , the number of sfegs will drop to 5 .",
    "the two purple dashed lines in the first diagrams are the criteria from stasinska et al .",
    "( 2006 ) which only use the [ nii]@xmath226583/h@xmath0 ratio , from these criteria the number of sfegs is also 5 for the sample .",
    "so , it is possible that among the 13 sfegs , the contamination from agn still exists for some egs .",
    "but , in general , the classification is reliable , the active star formation must take place in these sfegs at different level .",
    "* also there is a blue dotted line in the first diagram representing the empirical criterion from kauffmann et.al .",
    "( 2003 ) . *",
    ".the classification result from emission line diagnostic diagrams [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work , we show that sfegs deviate from the normal or quiescent egs , we try to explain it as a certain stage of evolution sequence of egs that surmised from the similarity in their sfhs and some other aspects .",
    "though this hypothesis and the two - component sfh is pretty consistent with our results , it is over simple for the theory of egs evolution and many problems remain unsolved . here",
    ", we present a brief discussion about several important ones , like the triggering mechanisms of the secondary starburst , the degree of confirmation for the evolution sequence and the egs formation scenario .      in this work",
    ", we find 13 egs with ongoing star - forming activity and 11 post - starburst egs , * which show the generality of the secondary star formation activity in local egs .",
    "this phenomenon has already been reported ( yi et al . 2005 ; jeong et al . 2007 ) .",
    "in fact , the optical band is not perfect for searching the evidence of residual star - formation in egs , the result from galex already pointed out that there are much more egs in the local universe than we thought have different level of residual or recent star - formation . *",
    "since the secondary star formation activity is considered as a rejuvenation phenomena , the most possible origin might be the galaxy - galaxy merger or interaction .",
    "however , in our sample , we do not find any obvious evidence of morphological disturbance which often indicates the merger and interaction .",
    "this is partly because the spatial resolution and the depth of the image from sdss is not enough for detecting the morphological perturbations . also , merger events which are responsible for the star formation activity is relative minor , the morphological perturbations already disappear and the star formation activities are mostly shut down by the agn feed back or the depletion of cold gas , but in the low - mass egs , the star formation activity could continue much longer as we see in our sample .      to put all types of egs into a uniform evolutionary sequence",
    "is a really tempting target and the evidence for the existence of such a sequence is already seen from our result .    from the properties we summarized before",
    ", we find that many properties show a sequence for different types of egs .",
    "the number of seyfert , liner and composite egs is quite small , so the average may suffer from larger uncertainties , but we can see their connections and relations in several observational or stellar population s properties . for example , the optical color like u - r , the mass estimated by velocity dispersion and the average age of their stellar populations . all these information show us the possibility that there could be a sequence between these different types of egs .",
    "this sequence should be seen from two aspects , a time - related sequence and a mass - related sequence .",
    "the time - related sequence means there could be an evolutionary link between the star - forming and the quiescent egs , may be like : star - forming egs  composite egs  seyfert galaxies  liner  quiescent egs .",
    "actually , in s07 , the author found a sequence in the same form from a much larger early - type galaxies sample which is also selected from sdss data , although their method for decoding the sfh is quite different from what we used here .",
    "this sequence is also supported by the concept of agn feedback ( ciotti & ostriker 1997 ; silk & rees 1998 ) who is responsible for shutting down of star - formation activity .    by the stellar population synthesis method we used here ,",
    "the sfhs of different types of egs are actually oversimple and very coarse , we can not ascertain the accurate age and the intensity of the secondary starburst .",
    "so the evolutionary sequence we proposed above is generally a logical guess .",
    "based on this hypothesis , we see clearly another sequence which is dominated by the mass of the galaxies which means the more massive of the egs , the more rapid they evolve .",
    "the @xmath47-elements enhancement in the massive egs suggest that the star formation activities were more efficient and rapid than their low - mass counterparts .",
    "the time scale of the secondary starburst estimated by the ` starlight ` supports the result too .    * besides the galaxy property like stellar mass , the influence from environment should be considered too .",
    "although our sample is not suitable for the discussion of environment ( relative small and only from a small area in the sky ) , we found among the 13 sfegs , none of them is in the cluster , which at least show that the low - density environment may be more suitable for the residual star formation .",
    "*    * we already knew that galaxies in different stage of merger could show different level of activity and make up an evolutionary sequence .",
    "but , since we excluded the galaxies with obvious disturbed morphology , none of the egs in our sample is in the process of strong interaction or major merger , which means that it is hard to determine the existence of such a merger - driven evolutionary sequence for our sample .",
    "if more accurate sfh could be derived from these egs , we can compare them to the sfh of galaxies that are in the stage of on - going merger , then maybe the relations between different types of egs with the mergers could be found . *",
    "another interesting question is if the evolutionary sequence is really exist , where should the e+a egs be placed .",
    "the stellar population properties show their similarity with quiescent and star - forming egs in different way , we believe these galaxies are post - starburst galaxies , but their role in the evolution of egs is still unclear .",
    "also we should remember , if the star - formation activity is triggered by merger events , this sequence of evolution could happen more than once in the history of egs , the real sfh could show evidence of impacts by several evolutionary sequences though the sfh we recovered did nt have enough resolution . and for the e+a egs in this sample , maybe it is not appropriate to put them about 1 gyrs behind the sfegs on the evolutionary sequence . from the mass fraction of young and intermediate age stellar population in e+a egs and sfegs",
    ", it seems like that the e+a egs had more active star formation than the sfegs .",
    "the sfh of e+a egs is actually an interesting question to be answered .",
    "we have studied the properties of egs with recent star - forming activity in the local universe .",
    "our main purpose is to establish the differences as well as the possible evolutionary connections among the different types of egs , and thus to place star - forming egs ( sfegs ) in the correct sequence of egs evolution .",
    "the main results of this paper are the following :    1 .   from a sample of 487 local ( ( z@xmath48 ) egs drawn from the sdss dr3",
    "we discover 13 galaxies with obvious active star - forming activity from emission line diagnostic diagrams , and 11 e+a post - starburst galaxies . among the 13 sfegs ,",
    "7 have unambiguous morphological classifications as egs while the remaining 6 galaxies have been classified as @xmath15 . from a visual inspection of their images we found no obvious difference between the morphology of these 6 galaxies from those of typical egs .",
    "the fraction of sfegs is @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 when consider only the 7 ones with @xmath14 ) and the fraction for e+as is @xmath51 .",
    "2 .   sfegs shows some obvious broad differences from quiescent egs : smaller sizes , lower masses , and lower luminosities .",
    "their optical colors are bluer than those of normal egs . in particular , however , we actually found four sfegs that have luminosities and masses typical of quiescent egs . on the other hand ,",
    "our e+as show a remarkable similarity in mass , luminosity , and color to the quiescent egs .",
    "3 .   from stellar population synthesis ( ` starlight ` ) fitting , we estimated the distribution of different stellar populations .",
    "we found for the local egs in our sample , the star - formation history can be described by a minor `` juvenile '' stellar population formed during secondary star - forming activity around 1gyr ago on the background of a dominant old stellar population formed a long time ago during a very intense period of star formation .",
    "this simple description is basically valid for all types of egs including the quiescent egs that show no evidence of recent star - formation at all . from this point of view",
    "we can say the secondary star - forming activity , the so - called `` juvenile '' effect , is quite common in local egs .",
    "4 .   we found a mass - age relation indicating that more massive egs tend to have older average ages . a similar correlation between age and metallicity , however , was not found . from population synthesis",
    "we find that our sfegs have younger ages ( especially from the flux - weighted average age ) and lower average metallicities .",
    "also , due to the active star - formation these egs have higher dust extinction .",
    "the discrepancy between mass estimates from stellar populations and from the velocity dispersion may be due to the presence of a central stellar disc or some other rotationally supported component associated with a recent star - formation event , and which can lower the velocity dispersion estimate .",
    "5 .   from our simple analysis of absorption line indices",
    "we find several interesting results .",
    "first , from our analysis of the @xmath26-index relation , we found a good correlation between age and @xmath0-element sensitive indices , but no relation was found for iron - peak sensitive indices .",
    "these results confirm the mass - age relation and suggest that the @xmath0-element abundances tend to be higher in more massive galaxies , but the fe - peak elements abundance seem to show no correlation with galaxy mass .",
    "second , we notice that e+as , which have masses ( velocity dispersions ) similar to those of quiescent egs , show completely different distributions in most of the @xmath26-index diagrams , and specially in the relation between age and @xmath0-element sensitive indices .",
    "in fact , line indices of e+a galaxies are much closer to those of sfegs than to normal ellipticals .",
    "third , we found that the @xmath0-enhanced effect is very common among local egs , but we do not find a correlation with galaxy mass . 6 .",
    "from the different properties discussed above we consider that sfegs are not a particularly special type of egs : they are not `` young '' objects since the main stellar populations are as old as those of normal egs while their star formation histories show considerable similarity with the quiescent ones .",
    "this seems to indicate that sfegs are just passing through an evolutionary stage , which is more pronounced for low mass egs , but is still part of a common evolutionary sequence for elliptical galaxies that is determined by total mass and environment .",

    "<S> + the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies ( egs ) is still an open question . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , recent observations suggest that elliptical galaxies are not only simple spheroidal systems of old stars . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we analyze a sample of elliptical galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey in order to study the star - forming activity in local elliptical galaxies . among these 487 ellipticals </S>",
    "<S> we find that 13 egs show unambiguous evidence of recent star - formation activity betrayed by conspicuous nebular emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> using the evolutionary stellar population synthesis models and lick absorption line indices we derive stellar ages , metallicities , and @xmath0-element abundances , and thus reconstruct the star formation and chemical evolution history of the star - forming elliptical galaxies ( sfegs ) in our sample .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that sfegs have relative younger stellar population age , higher metallicity , and lower stellar mass , and that their star formation history can be well described by a recent minor and short starburst superimposed on old stellar component . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect 11 e+a galaxies whose stellar population properties are closer to those of quiescent ( normal ) ellipticals than to star - forming ones . </S>",
    "<S> however , from the analysis of their absorption line indices , we note that our e+a galaxies show a significant fraction of intermediate - age stellar populations , remarkably different from the quiescent galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this might suggest an evolutionary link between e+as and star - forming ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we confirm the relations between age , metallicity , @xmath0 element abundance , and stellar mass for local elliptical galaxies .    </S>",
