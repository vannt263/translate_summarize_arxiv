    "in the past decades the investigation of @xmath2-decay has played a major role in understanding weak interactions and their structure . even though being a little bit out of fashion , there are still interesting problems to be investigated .",
    "among them is the second forbidden unique electron capture ( ec ) of @xmath0te occuring to the ground state of @xmath0sb with a transition energy of @xmath3 kev @xcite .",
    "two positive evidences obtained for this decay mode show a discrepancy by six orders of magnitude , namely @xmath4 yrs @xcite and @xmath5 yrs @xcite . even with the lower value already in slight disagreement with other bounds on the lifetime of k shell capture in @xmath0te @xcite it",
    "is quoted quite often in literature @xcite .",
    "however , still only a lower bound of about @xmath6 yrs is used @xcite .",
    "one of the main problems of the past measurements was associated with the fact that observations relied on the outside detection of k x - rays following the deexcitation of @xmath0sb .",
    "this line is at 26.1 kev , very close to the te k x - ray line at 27.3 kev which might be excited by other processes like cosmic rays and radioactive background .",
    "+ in the measurement reported here , a new technique for searches of rare nuclear decays using cdznte semiconductor detectors has been used for the first time .",
    "these offers several advantages .",
    "the natural abundance of @xmath0te is 0.9 % , hence it is intrinsic to any detector containing te . due to this fact , the total cascade after k - capture is contained within the detector resulting in a peak at 30.5 kev .",
    "cd(zn)te detectors are well known devices in x - ray and @xmath7-ray astronomy and offer good energy resolution .",
    "the study was performed within a pilot project for the cobra - experiment @xcite , which plans to use a large amount of cdznte detectors to explore double beta decay .",
    "schematic drawing of the setup used to perform the measurement described .",
    "the detector is surrounded by a passive shield of clean copper and lead and an active shield against cosmic ray muons using plastic scintillators .",
    "for details see text.,width=302 ]    the measurements were performed with a @xmath8 mm@xmath9 cdznte detector provided by ev - products .",
    "the detector is encapsulated within an aluminium - tube .",
    "it is working with the coplanar grid technology , focussing on the readout of electrons @xcite .",
    "this avoids asymmetric peaks normally seen because of the insufficient collection of holes due to trapping within cdznte .",
    "the energy resolution was measured with various sources , among them @xmath10am and @xmath11co , resulting in lines at 59.5 , 122.1 and 136.5 kev respectively .",
    "an fwhm - energy resolution of @xmath12 kev is determined for 30.5 kev by extrapolation .",
    "+ to be sensitive for rare decays , a special shielding had to be constructed to reduce background events due to environmental radioactivity and cosmic rays . a schematic plot of the setup is shown in fig.1 .",
    "in this way , a @xmath13 cm box made of copper and lead was designed .",
    "the inner @xmath14 cm consisted of electrolytic copper , the outer part was made of spectroscopy lead . in a first step ,",
    "the copper was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath .",
    "all lead bricks were etched shortly before installation with hcl and hno@xmath15 to clean the surfaces , the copper was electropolished .",
    "the complete shielding was surrounded by an air - tight box of aluminium , which was flushed with nitrogen .",
    "this prevents air and with it @xmath16rn from penetrating into the apparatus . to suppress signals due to cosmic ray muons , an active veto consisting of 19 plastic scintillators was used .",
    "they covered all four sides of the box in a single layer with about 95 % detection efficiency as well as the top side in two layers resulting in about 99.5 % efficiency .",
    "all scintillators were fed into discriminators and a common or was used to form the veto signal . in that way after the firing of any of the scintillators the data aquisition was blocked for 20 @xmath17s resulting in a dead - time of about @xmath18 % . only accepted signals were fed into a multichannel analyser card in a pc , serving as daq - system .",
    "the shielding depth was about 5 meter water equivalent ( mwe ) .     measured spectrum in the region of interest .",
    "no obvious peak is visible .",
    "the bin width is 1 kev . shown",
    "are the fit assuming a pure background distribution with an @xmath19-dependence ( dashed line ) and the background fit plus the excluded gaussian peak ( solid line).,width=302 ]",
    "single runs were taken with 30 minutes life - time each .",
    "392 runs were obtained of which 2 had to be removed resulting in 195 hours of good data .",
    "the obtained spectrum of interest is shown in fig.2 .",
    "no signal is visible at 30.5 kev . fitting the region from @xmath20 to @xmath21 kev with a @xmath22 function results in a @xmath23 of @xmath24 within the @xmath25e - region around the peak position ,",
    "a fit including a gaussian peak at the right position and with the correct energy resolution gives a @xmath23 of @xmath26 while the gaussian content ist consistent with zero . excluding the @xmath25e - region around @xmath27",
    "kev ( i.e. 25 to 36 kev ) from the fitpoints , the resulting @xmath23 of the pure background fit is still @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the background - only hypothesis is well within allowed parameters .    using the fit without the peak region and adding a gaussian more than 31.2 events can be ruled out ( 95 % cl ) . knowing the mass of @xmath29 g the upper bound can be converted into a lower limit on the half - life for the electron capture of @xmath0te : t_1/2 > 3.2 10 ^ 16 95 % this clearly rules out possible observations with half - lives of the order of @xmath6 yrs and is in strong favor of the results of alessandrello et al .",
    "longer half - lives are also supported from theoretical considerations @xcite .",
    "a novel technique for studying rare nuclear decays using cdznte semiconductor detectors was used to investigate the second forbidden unique electron capture of @xmath0te .",
    "it takes advantage of the fact that source and detector are identical .",
    "the main motivation for this search was to discriminate between two published results which differ by six orders of magnitude .",
    "no evidence for this process was found and a half - life limit larger than @xmath30 yrs ( 95 % cl ) is obtained .",
    "this clearly rules out the solutions obtaining @xmath6 yrs .",
    "the measurement was performed during tests for the planned cobra - experiment to search for double beta decay .",
    "a proof for the quoted half - life of @xmath31 yrs can only be done with a setup using a larger amount of cdznte detectors .",
    "we thank h. kiel and c. gling for valuable discussions and support .",
    "we also acknowledge the support of the mechanical workshop of the university of dortmund during the construction of the test - setup .",
    "finally we want to thank ev - products for generously lending the detector that was used for our measurements .",
