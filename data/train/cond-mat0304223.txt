    "recent spectacular progress in the manipulation of neutral atoms in optical lattices @xcite has opened the way to the simulation of complex quantum systems of condensed matter physics , such as high@xmath0 superconductors , hall systems , and superfluid @xmath1he , by means of atomic systems with perfectly controllable physical parameters @xcite .",
    "optical lattices are stable periodic arrays of microscopic potentials created by the interference patterns of intersecting laser beams @xcite .",
    "atoms can be confined to different lattice sites , and by varying the strength of the periodic potential it is possible to tune the interatomic interactions with great precision .",
    "they can be enhanced well into regimes of strong correlation , even in the dilute limit .",
    "the transition to a strong coupling regime can be realized by increasing the depth of the lattice potential wells , a quantity that is directly proportional to the intensity of the laser light .",
    "this is an experimental parameter that can be controlled with great accuracy .",
    "for this reason , besides the fundamental interest for the investigation of quantum phase transitions @xcite and other basic quantum phenomena @xcite , optical lattices have become an important practical tool for applications , ranging from laser cooling @xcite to quantum control and information processing @xcite , and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the theory of neutral bosonic atoms in optical lattices has been developed @xcite by assuming that the atoms are confined to the lowest bloch band of the periodic potential .",
    "it can then be shown that the system is effectively described by a single  band bose ",
    "hubbard model hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in such a model the superfluid  insulator transition is predicted to occur when the on site boson  boson interaction energy becomes comparable to the hopping energy between adjacent lattice sites .",
    "this situation can be experimentally achieved by increasing the strength of the lattice potential , which results in a strong suppression of the kinetic ( hopping ) energy term . in this way",
    ", the superfluid  mott - insulator quantum phase transition has been realized by loading an ultracold atomic bose ",
    "einstein condensate in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the study of dilute mixtures of interacting bosonic and fermionic neutral atoms subject to an optical lattice and a superimposed trapping harmonic potential at zero temperature .",
    "we assume the fermions to be identical ( for instance spin  polarized in a magnetic trap ) , so that there are only @xmath2wave boson  boson and fermion  boson contact interactions present .",
    "we construct an effective single ",
    "band bose ",
    "fermi hubbard hamiltonian , and we determine the ground state energy and on site density distributions in different mean field approximations of increasing complexity .",
    "our main aim at this level of description is to determine the basic ground state properties of the mixture and to study how the bosonic superfluid ",
    "insulator transition is influenced by the presence of the fermions . besides the study of the latter issue , and the assessment of the properties of linear stability of the system against boson ",
    "fermion demixing , a remarkable finding of our analysis is that a quantum binary mixture loaded in a very deep optical lattice allows for a disordered phase of very many degenerate or quasi  degenerate ground states separated by very high potential energy barriers . in the limit of very large lattice potential strengths the basic mirror symmetry of the optical lattice",
    "is broken .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ model ] we set the notation and derive the bose ",
    "fermi hubbard model hamiltonian .",
    "we then discuss the range of validity of the approximations and the assumptions used in the derivation . in section [ stability ]",
    "we introduce some basic mean field descriptions to study the properties of stability of the mixture against phase separation , and we provide a simple analytical criterion for the onset of a superfluid phase for the bosons starting from a mott  insulating ground state .    in section [ gutzwiller ] we present numerical simulations for a small number of particles in the framework of the gutzwiller variational ansatz .",
    "two important cases have to be distinguished : boson  fermion repulsive or attractive interaction ( the boson ",
    "boson interaction is taken to be always repulsive ) . in the first instance",
    ", one can observe a continuous transition to a complete demixing of the fermions from the bosons , and to a mott  insulating phase of the bosons , as the strength of the lattice potential is increased . in the case of attractive boson  fermion interactions there is no transition to demixing or to collapse of the mixture , while one still observes a mott  insulating transition for the bosons . by studying the behavior of the superfluid order parameter",
    "we show that in both cases the transition takes place at the same critical value of the lattice potential strength .",
    "moreover , due to the strong attraction , the fermions and the bosons tend to form together ordered block ",
    "crystalline structures at the center of the trap .    in section [ degeneracy ]",
    "we present a numerical analysis that , although constrained to a small number of particles ( five bosons and five fermions ) , seems to indicate the existence of a rich structure of degenerate energy minima for large enough values of the lattice potential strength .",
    "such an energy landscape suggests the possible existence of disordered phases of the mixture due to the delicate interplay between the different physical parameters ( boson hopping , fermion hopping , boson on site energy , boson ",
    "fermion on site energy ) , the lattice depth , and the symmetries of the problem .",
    "finally , a summary and an outlook to future research are shortly discussed in section [ outlook ] .",
    "we start by introducing the hamiltonian for a bose  fermi mixture loaded into optical lattice potentials and confined by additional , slowly varying , external ( harmonic ) trapping potentials .",
    "it is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 represent the boson and fermion kinetic energies , respectively , while @xmath5 denote the boson  boson and the fermion ",
    "boson contact interaction energies .",
    "they are parametrized by the boson  boson and the fermion ",
    "boson @xmath2wave scattering lengths @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , and by the boson mass @xmath8 and the reduced mass @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the fermion mass .",
    "the potential energies @xmath11 are due to the trapping and lattice potentials .",
    "we consider pure magnetic trapping for bosons and fermions , so that fermions are spin  polarized and their @xmath2wave interaction energy @xmath12",
    "can be neglected : @xmath13 . in the subsequent analysis",
    "we will consider the harmonic approximation of a typical quadrupolar magnetic field with strong anisotropy in the transverse directions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "moreover , if we assume trapping in the same magnetic state for the bosons and the fermions , then the trapping frequencies are related according to @xmath19 , so that the two potentials coincide : @xmath20 .",
    "the ground  state harmonic oscillator lengths , however , are different due to the different masses , and also differ for the @xmath21-direction on the one hand and the @xmath14 and @xmath15-directions on the other hand : @xmath22 in the @xmath21 direction , and @xmath23 in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions .",
    "we next consider a lattice structure for the bosons and the fermions in the @xmath21direction , associated to the corresponding bosonic and fermionic one  dimensional optical lattice potentials @xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the lattice spacing associated to the wave vector @xmath28 of the standing laser light .",
    "if the lattice potentials are produced by a far off  resonant laser for both species , the lattice potential strengths are equal for both fermions and bosons : @xmath29 , and the two optical lattices coincide exactly .",
    "this is the situation we will always consider in the following .    in the presence of a strong optical lattice and a sufficiently shallow external confinement in the @xmath21 direction ,",
    "the field operators can be expanded in terms of the single  particle wannier functions localized at each lattice site @xmath30 .",
    "further , the typical interaction energies involved are normally not strong enough in order to excite higher vibrational states , and we can retain only the lowest vibrational state in each lattice potential well both for bosons and fermions ( single  band approximation ) . in case of stronger external confinements , or interactions , one should include higher bloch bands as well in the expansion of the field operators , a case we do not consider in the present context . in the harmonic approximation , the wannier functions @xmath31 factorize in the product of harmonic oscillator states in each direction , with the trapping potential almost constant between adjacent lattice sites .",
    "we then have @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the bosonic and fermionic annihilation operators at the @xmath36th lattice site , @xmath37 , and the index @xmath36 runs on positive and negative integers , the origin of the lattice being fixed at @xmath38 so that it coincides with the center ( the minimum ) of the external trapping potential . in each lattice potential",

    "state properties of the system .",
    "therefore , when exploiting the wannier function expansions ( [ expansion1 ] ) and ( [ expansion2 ] ) to map the full hamiltonian ( [ fully ] ) into its lattice version , we discard all terms that are of order @xmath46 or of higher powers of it . otherwise , nonlocal effects caused by the trapping potential , like site ",
    "dependent hopping terms , have to be considered @xcite .",
    "finally , this approximation scheme leads to the following hubbard  type hamiltonian : @xmath47 the first line in the above bose ",

    "neighbor hopping of bosons and fermions , with amplitudes @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the terms in the second line describe boson ",
    "boson on site repulsion ( with @xmath50 ) and boson  fermion on site interaction .",
    "this interaction can be repulsive or attractive , depending on the sign of @xmath51 .",
    "the third line describes the energy offset at each lattice site due to the @xmath21 component of the external trapping potentials @xmath52 , and the last line contains the overall constant zero  point energy terms due to the @xmath14 and @xmath15 components of @xmath52 and to the lattice potential @xmath53 .",

    "we have included as well the overlap integral + @xmath77 of adjacent wannier functions .",
    "the overlap is negligible but for very small values of the potential strength , confirming that terms of the order of the overlap integral can be neglected in the hamiltonian .",
    "the gaussian approximation holds rather well as can be seen by comparing the associated bosonic hopping amplitude @xmath48 with the one obtained by using the exact 1@xmath78 mathieu equation @xcite .",
    "= 8.5 cm    besides the conditions mentioned earlier , all the expressions derived in the present section are justified under the following circumstances .",
    "first of all , we must require that the two  body scattering processes are not influenced by the confinements , a condition that is guaranteed if the lengths of the confining and lattice potentials in all directions are much larger than the boson  boson and fermion  boson scattering lengths .",
    "next , the single  band structure of the lattice hamiltonian is assured if the lattice spacing @xmath27 is much greater than the harmonic confinements in each direction at all lattice sites . on the other hand , in this limit",
    "the harmonic approximation for the wannier functions at each lattice well is automatically satisfied . finally , as mentioned earlier , the assumption of a slowly varying confining potential such that lda is applicable leads to the condition @xmath45 .",
    "we can summarize all the above conditions with the following chain of inequalities : @xmath79    our model is for some aspects unrealistic , since in present experimental situations the transverse confinements can not be made very strong .",
    "therefore a multi  band structure can appear with several radial states being occupied , as reported in a recent experiment by the florence group on bose ",
    "fermi mixtures in a @xmath80@xmath78 optical lattice @xcite .",
    "in this section we investigate the zero temperature ground state properties of the system in a mean field approximation . in the following",
    "we will adopt a grand - canonical description through the hamiltonian @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the bosonic and fermionic chemical potentials . according to the hohenberg  kohn theorem , the ground state energy @xmath84 is a functional of the on site bosonic and fermionic densities @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where the expectation values are taken with respect to the ground state with state vector @xmath87 .",
    "we decompose the functional @xmath88 according to @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the energy contribution depending only on the boson parameters @xmath48 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 ; @xmath93 is the energy depending only on the fermion parameters ; and @xmath94 is the term due to boson  fermion interactions .",
    "we treat this latter term in mean field approximation : neglecting exchange correlation effects : @xmath95    exchange correlation effects have been recently studied for the case of homogeneous mixtures in the continuum @xcite . for the fermion energy @xmath93",
    ", we take the energy of the noninteracting homogeneous system and exploit local density approximation ( lda ) on it , @xmath96 this approximate description of the fermions is well justified in the presence of a slowly varying trapping potential ( so that lda can be applied ) , when there are no direct interactions among the fermions ( as in our case ) , and moreover when one can neglect induced phonon  mediated self ",
    "interactions due to the presence of the bosons .",
    "therefore , in this situation , the nontrivial features of different quantum phases will regard only the bosonic sector and not the fermionic one .",
    "however , the presence of the fermions will indirectly contribute to the properties of the different bosonic phases , and this is the subject that we will study in the following .    in order to find an expression for the boson energy @xmath97 we will proceed in steps of increasing accuracy .",
    "first we perform a very simple mean field analysis in two extreme limits : a completely superfluid boson ground state and a totally mott  insulating boson ground state . in the latter case we will provide a simple criterion for stability of the mixture against demixing .",
    "next , we will perform a perturbation expansion around the mott  insulating boson ground state to recover perturbatively the phase boundary against transition to superfluidity .",
    "finally , in the next section , we will study the ground state properties of the mixture using a gutzwiller ansatz for the bosons capable of describing the intermediate regimes between the insulating and superfluid bosonic phases .",
    "we first consider the bosons to be superfluid . in this regime",
    "the chemical potential and the number of particles in a homogeneous system are related , to lowest order in @xmath91 , via @xcite : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the density of condensed bosons . additionally , for very weak interaction @xmath100 .",

    "fermi interaction energy we can then write for the inhomogeneous bose ",

    "to lowest order in @xmath48 we neglect the kinetic term altogether .",
    "then it is easily shown that the relation between the bosonic chemical potential and the bosonic density for a homogeneous system is given by @xmath102 exploiting lda as before , we have in the inhomogeneous case at a given lattice site : @xmath103 comparing eqns .",
    "( [ nbsf ] ) and ( [ nbmi ] ) , we observe the same behavior of the on site density profiles but for a constant correction to the boson chemical potential depending whether the bosons are in a superfluid or in a mott  insulating state . finally , differentiating the energy functional with respect to the on site populations of the fermions , we determine the associated density field and the set of coupled equations describing the ground state of the mixture at any lattice site , @xmath104 @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the proper expression of the boson chemical potential according to whether the bosons are in the mott  insulating or superfluid regime .",
    "these equations are valid at a given lattice site @xmath36 if @xmath107 , otherwise one must set @xmath108 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath109 we must impose @xmath110 at the given lattice site , while @xmath111 must be imposed when @xmath112 .",
    "these expressions are the lattice analogs of the thomas  fermi description of boson ",
    "fermion mixtures in the continuum .",
    "we remark that in the mott ",
    "insulating regime the boson on site populations @xmath113 must be rounded off to the integer closest to the solutions of eqns .",
    "( [ bfdensities1])([bfdensities2 ] ) .    in the mott ",
    "insulating regime we can determine a criterion of linear stability against phase separation of the two species if we expand the energy functional @xmath88 to second order in the small density variations @xmath114 around the minimum provided by the solution of eqns .",

    "this last condition is always satisfied for @xmath50 and identical fermions .",
    "if this is not the case for every site @xmath36 , then the ground state is not stable against demixing .",
    "this result is similar to that recently obtained for a mixture of two different boson species on a lattice @xcite , which states that the mixture is stable if @xmath118 , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the boson  boson interaction strengths of species @xmath80 and @xmath121 respectively , and @xmath122 is the interspecies coupling .",

    "moreover , since @xmath141 for all lattice sites @xmath36 , the larger the value of @xmath138 , the more symmetric is the role of bosons and fermions .",
    "there are then many ground states that are degenerate in energy with respect to any permutation of lattice sites  as long as all particles are located around the minimum of the confining external potential @xmath142 .",
    "these degenerate configurations will be given by all possible symmetric and nonsymmetric fermion and boson distributions in a region around the center of the lattice , with every site of the region occupied by one and only one particle .",
    "such possible configurations are for example checkerboard alternating patterns of bosons and fermions , or mott bosonic central configurations with fermionic wings on the sides , or consecutive block crystalline arrangements of variable length of bosons and fermions . in brief , while the hamiltonian formally retains its mirror symmetry under reflection of the lattice around its center , the degenerate ground states need not , and spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking occurs . at the same time",
    "complete boson  fermion exchange symmetry sets on .",
    "no ground state is _ a priori _ favored compared to any other : any random pattern of consecutive bosons and fermions located around the minimum of the external trapping potential is a legitimate ground state .",
    "[ disorder ] shows representative on site bosonic densities in the regime of large values of @xmath138 around @xmath143 for the case of boson  boson and boson  fermion repulsion in a system composed of five bosons and five fermions : at each value of the lattice potential strength , a particular state is selected from the set of those with same energy .",
    "each vanishing value of the on site bosonic density means that exactly one fermion has filled that particular lattice site .",
    "the large value chosen for @xmath76 allows to clearly stress the random nature of the configuration patterns even for very small changes of the lattice potential strength , whereas degeneracy and disorder can set in already at lower values of the lattice depth , depending on the tuning of the harmonic oscillator and scattering lengths ( see below ) .",
    "= 4.5 cm    the degenerate states are separated by energy barriers .",
    "the system is non  ergodic , and hysteresis should be observed : what particular state is chosen , depends on the exact mechanism of preparation of the system and of loading of the mixture into the optical lattice .",
    "the criterion for the onset of degeneracy and nonperiodic ground states in the bulk region around the center of the lattice and of the trapping potential is easily identified , by looking at the relative importance of the trapping on site energy with respect to the on site boson or fermion interaction energy .",
    "for instance , to allow for the fermionic behavior of the boson on site occupation numbers ( either @xmath139 or @xmath80 ) one must require that the energy is lower having one boson at the edge of the bulk central region rather than having it sitting on top of another boson at the center of the lattice : @xmath144 the analogous condition for the bose ",
    "fermi on site interaction is : @xmath145    for smaller values of @xmath138 , the boson hopping contribution will become more and more important .",
    "a representative situation of this intermediate regime is depicted in figs .",
    "[ bdensityrep ] and [ fdensityrep ] : here , the repulsion between bosons and fermions is strong enough to allow for phase separation , while the non ",
    "negligible hopping terms still favor configurations where bosons have bosons as nearest neighbors .",
    "the transition to degeneracy and disorder , exact in the limit of infinite lattice depth , is a novel and peculiar feature of bose ",
    "fermi mixtures and it should hold in general for any multicomponent bose and/or fermi dilute atomic system loaded in a deep optical lattice at zero temperature , provided that intercomponent interactions are repulsive and the on site confining potentials coincide for the different components .",
    "it clearly can not take place in a single  component system , say a pure single ",
    "component bose gas , where only a sf ",
    "mi transition occurs @xcite .",
    "the rather complex and rich interplay between ordered and disordered configurations of bose ",
    "fermi mixtures in very deep optical lattices will be considered in more detail elsewhere .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the zero  temperature properties of a mixture of weakly interacting gases of neutral bosonic and fermionic atoms loaded in one  dimensional optical lattices and confined by harmonic trapping potentials .",
    "we have derived a single  band bose ",
    "fermi hubbard hamiltonian , and performed some mean field studies of the zero  temperature phase diagram .",
    "we have considered the case of a quasi ",
    "free fermion sea acting on the bosons , which have been treated in their full dynamical range .",
    "we have always worked in the approximation of @xmath2wave boson  boson and boson  fermion contact interactions . according to the possible different combinations of intraspecies and interspecies attractive and repulsive interactions",
    ", the system displays a rich phase structure , including the onset of a sf ",
    "mi transition in the boson sector , and a simultaneous transition to demixing in the boson  fermion sector .",
    "the optical lattice potential plays a crucial role , allowing to tune the system into regimes of strong boson  boson and boson  fermion couplings as the lattice depth is increased . for very deep lattices",
    "the system displays a remarkable transition to a multiply degenerate phase in which all possible permutations of configurations with one bosonic or fermionic atom per site are legitimate ground states .",
    "the transition is related with breaking of the lattice mirror symmetry for very large values of the lattice depth .",
    "this peculiar disordered pattern of degenerate ground  state configurations separated by very large barriers is somehow reminiscent of the behavior of classical disordered systems like glasses and spin glasses , but it takes place in a quantum system at zero temperature .    the setting that has been investigated in detail in the present paper can be extended in various ways .",
    "certainly a larger number of bosons and fermions have to be considered in order to obtain a more realistic description of the system . while our previous analytical findings are applicable to any numbers of atoms , in order to extend the numerical calculations to larger numbers more powerful numerical methods have to be introduced .",
    "so far , monte carlo simulations with a fairly large number of particles have been carried out only for an inhomogeneous bose  hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the authors have also speculated that the qualitative phase diagram does not depend on the dimensionality of the system .    in order to extend the work presented in this paper to the case of interacting fermions ,",
    "one may either allow for different fermionic species in magnetic traps or for spin ",
    "unpolarized identical fermions in optical traps .",
    "correlation effects , that are already included in the gutzwiller ansatz for the bosons , will then become important for the fermions as well @xcite . in this way the bose ",
    "fermi interaction has to be consistently incorporated beyond the mean  field level . in the present paper",

    "fermi interaction is consistent , since we only included the fermions in a mean  field and lda prescription .    at the opposite extreme",

    "allow for new possibilities of quantum information processing in optical lattices .",
    "the fermions would be suitable for storage of quantum information due to their non  interacting behavior , whereas the bosons could be used to let the systems interact and perform operations .    in turn",
    ", the study of such coupled quantum systems exhibiting collective phenomena with the methods of the theory of multi - particle entanglement is an attractive investigation in its own right .",
    "the aim here is not to use the coupled system to prepare strongly entangled systems that form the starting point for applications in quantum information processing . instead",
    ", the motivation of such investigations is to go beyond conventional methods to characterize the natural correlations present in the distributed system at zero temperature @xcite .    the quantitative theory of entanglement that abstracts from the actual physical realization of a bose  fermi hubbard model could provide the tools to understand how global properties emerge here from quantum correlations between the elementary constituents .",
