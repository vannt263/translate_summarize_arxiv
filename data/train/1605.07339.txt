    "hunts for fundamental correlations in strongly interacting quarks and gluons inside hadron can be a hint to understand the hadron structure and the confinement mechanism .",
    "the constituent quarks are considered to be good effective degrees of freedom for the hadron structure , especially explaining the nucleon magnetic moment based on the spin flavor symmetry of the light quarks and low lying energy spectra of the heavy quarkonia by quark excitations in the linear - plus - coulomb confinement potential .",
    "the diquark as two quark pair correlation in hadron can be also a strong candidate of hadron constituent  @xcite .",
    "so far , the existence of diquark correlation inside hadrons has been suggested by phenomenological findings in baryon spectroscopy , weak non - leptnic decays , parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions , and especially the scalar diquark with flavor , spin and color antisymmetric configurations , which is so - called good diquark , is expected to have the most attractive correlation  @xcite . the strong correlation in the scalar diquark",
    "is obtained by one - gluon exchange and by instanton induced interactions , and has been found in lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "the strong correlation can be a remnant of the pauli - grsey symmetry in two - color qcd , in which quark - quark interactions for massless quarks are exactly same in strength as quark - antiquark interactions . in three - color qcd , this symmetry is explicitly broken and the quark - quark correlations get less attractive than the quark - antiquark correlation .    to investigate the nature of the confinement potential , we focus on the excitation spectra of the heavy baryons .",
    "so far , many works have been done for baryons spectra in quark - diquark models . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mass spectra of @xmath4 and @xmath5 excited states of non - strange baryons were investigated in a diquark - quark model based on the su(6)@xmath6o(3 ) classification  @xcite in special attentions of the fine structure by spin - orbit interactions .",
    "it was found that the detailed confinement mechanism is irrelevant for the fine structure of the intramultiplet splitting . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ground states of spin 3/2 baryons were investigated in a relativistic formulation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , radial and orbital excitations of baryons were calculated in a diquark - quark model with a confinement potential reproducing meson spectra , and detailed analyses were given for light flavor baryon spectra .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ground state masses of @xmath7 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 were calculated in a diquark qcd sum rule , in which a scalar diquark is explicitly considered as a fundamental field in operator product expansion , and the calculation successfully reproduced the observed @xmath7 s masses with a ",
    "constituent \" diquark mass 0.4 gev , satisfying the standard criteria for the qcd sum rule to work well .",
    "the system of a heavy quark and a diquark has an advantage to investigate the light diquark properties . as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , in meson wavefunctions , quark - antiquark component are dominated and diquark configuration are rather suppressed . this is because the diquark correlation is weaker than the quark - antiquark correlation and , once there exists a antiquark closed to a diquark , the diquark could easily fall apart and form a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "in light baryons , diquark configuration could play an important role for the baryon structure , but rearrangement of the diquark would be also important due to the symmetry among the light quarks . in systems of a heavy quark and two light quarks forming a heavy baryon , thanks to asymmetry between the light quark and the heavy quark , a diquark of two light quarks could easily emerge in the baryon .    in this brief note ,",
    "taking the quark - diquark picture with a point - like diquark , we report on the excitation energy of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons using the linear - plus - coulomb confinement potential suitable for the quarkonium spectra . here",
    "we will find a puzzle that the string tension in the confinement potential for quark and diquark systems should be half as strong as that for quark and antiquark systems to reproduce the @xmath0 and @xmath1 excitation energies .",
    "this is against the universality of the confinement force . to understand the overestimation of these excitation energies , we will examine the finite size effect of the diquark , and find that introduction of the diquark size could be one of the solutions of the above puzzle .",
    "we will also find that the excitation energy of the @xmath3 baryon should be smaller that that of @xmath0 in the quark - diquark picture , but experiments tell us that it is opposite .",
    "these puzzles should be solved when one takes the quark - diquark picture for the heavy baryons .",

    "we regard the heavy quark ( a charm or bottom quark ) and the scalar diquark as elementary particles and take a quark potential model in the non - relativistic formulation .",
    "we also assume that the diquark is a point - like particle . in the center of mass frame ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system including the rest masses of the quark and diquark is written as @xmath10 with the heavy quark mass @xmath11 , the diquark mass @xmath12 , the momentum of the relative motion @xmath4 and the reduced mass @xmath13 .",
    "we use the @xmath14 and @xmath15 quark masses as @xmath16 gev/@xmath17 and @xmath18/@xmath17 . the interaction between the heavy quark and the scalar diquark",
    "is assumed to be spherical and written as a coulomb plus linear form  @xcite @xmath19 with three constant parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the coulomb part proportional to @xmath23 expresses the asymptotic nature of the strong interaction in short distance , and the linear part , @xmath24 , represents the confinement potential with the string tension @xmath21 of the flux tube .",

    "it is known that the potential @xmath25 given in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) reproduces the charmonium and bottonium spectra well with appropriate spin - spin and spin - orbit interactions  @xcite .",
    "the scalar diquark of our interest has an anti - triplet color charge and it is same as the color charge of antiquark . because the color electric force should be independent of the quark flavor in the first approximation and be determined by the color charges , we may make good use of the potential determined by the quarkonium spectra for the quark - diquark system .",
    "the energy spectrum and the wave function of the quark - diquark system can be obtained by solving the schdinger equation for the radial variable of the relative motion : @xmath26 \\chi_{\\ell}(r )     = e_{\\ell } \\chi_{\\ell}(r ) ,   \\label{sch}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the reduced mass of the heavy quark and scalar diquark and @xmath27 is the radial wave function for the orbital angular momentum @xmath28 .",
    "the mass of the bound system for the heavy quark and the scalar diquark is given by @xmath29 . because this schdinger equation is a one - body equation after separating out the center of mass motion , it is simple enough to be solved numerically .",

    "we are of great interest in the excitation pattern of the quark - diquark system in the confinement potential .",
    "we focus on the energy spectrum without considering the fine structure caused by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the fine structure is not sensitive to the details of the confinement mechanism  @xcite .",
    "we may refine our model quantitatively , for instance , by fine - tuning quark and diquark masses , or introducing scale dependence of the coulomb part of the confinement potential .",
    "these are important next steps to be done . here",
    "we are of great interest in the global structure of the excitation spectra of the heavy baryon .",
    "thus , as a first step , we ignore these corrections and spin - orbit interaction .",
    "in this section , we present our results of the energy spectra obtained by solving the schrdinger equation  ( [ sch ] ) with the confinement potential  ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "first we show the charmonium and bottonium spectra to confirm that the confinement potential with @xmath33 and @xmath34 gev / fm reproduces the observed major excitation well .",
    "we will also see that with the same parameters the model works for the heavy mesons , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , with the light quark mass @xmath39  gev/@xmath17 and the strange quark mass @xmath40 gev/@xmath17 .",
    "next , finding that the confinement potential suitable for the meson spectra does _ not _ work in the quark - diquark systems to reproduce the excitation energies of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we search for the appropriate parameter set to reproduce the @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra .",

    "than @xmath15 , thanks to the pair creation of diquark and antidiquark , there are no interaction and the potential becomes zero .",
    "the constant @xmath22 is determined so as to reproduce the absolute value of the @xmath0 ground state mass by the potential  ( [ pot ] ) together with the center of mass energy @xmath104 . in the present case @xmath105 gev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tunnel ] , we plot the potential  ( [ tunnel ] ) together with the centrifugal potential for @xmath94 .",
    "the energy @xmath96 is the mass of @xmath0 with @xmath94 measured from @xmath97 .",
    "the positions @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the classical turning points .",
    "the excited @xmath0 state with @xmath96 decays by penetrating through the potential barrier from @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "we calculate the decay width based on gamov theory for nuclear @xmath20 decay . there",
    "the tunneling probability is calculated by the wkb approximation : @xmath110    = 0.048.\\ ] ] for the confined particle in the classical orbit , the numbers of the trials of the penetration per unit time may be calculated as @xmath111 with the length of the classical orbit @xmath112 and the velocity of the particle @xmath113 .",
    "we calculate the velocity by @xmath114 with the expectation value of the kinetic energy @xmath115 evaluated with the obtained wavefucntion , @xmath116 gev . finally the decay width is estimated as @xmath117},\\ ] ] the size of the obtained value is consistent with the observed decay widths of the @xmath60 states .",
    "it is noted that , since the initial state with @xmath118 has negative parity , the relative angular moment between @xmath0 and the @xmath119 system in the final state should be a odd number , such as @xmath120 , for @xmath119 coming from a sigma meson .",
    "nevertheless , in this model we do not consider spin and parity of the decay reaction .",
    "thus , we could have a further suppression factor for parity conserved configurations .",
    "a similar calculation is also done using the potential with @xmath34 gev / fm . in the calculation we set the mass of the @xmath60 state to be the observed mass , which is not an eigenenergy of the potential with @xmath34 gev / fm .",
    "we find the decay width @xmath121 mev , which is one order of magnitude larger than the observed width .",
    "this fact also supports the smaller string tension for the heavy quark and diquark system .      as reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , the size of the diquark can be as large as 1 fm . here",
    "we estimate the effect of the diquark size to the excitation spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "let us set the positions of the up , down and charm quarks to be @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "assuming that the interaction strength of the inter quark force is half of the force between quark and antiquark , we may write down the color electric potential between the charm quark and the light quarks as @xmath125 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the coupling strengths appearing in the quark - antiquark potential . introducing a jacobi coordinate defined by @xmath126 and @xmath127 , we write the potential as @xmath128 we recover the potential ( [ pot ] ) in the limit of @xmath129 , that is @xmath130 . assuming that two light quarks form a diquark",
    ", we do not regard @xmath131 as a dynamical valuable rather as a parameter for the diquark size .",
    "the modulus of @xmath132 , @xmath133 , represents the distance between the diquark and the charm quark .",
    "now we try two ways of the estimation of the diquark size effect .",
    "first we use perturbation theory by regarding the diquark size to be small .",
    "let us expand the linear potential in terms of the diquark size @xmath134 and take the leading correction : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the angle of @xmath137 and @xmath132 .",
    "we calculate the finite size effect for the @xmath0 excitation energy between the 1s and 1p states as first order perturbation : @xmath138 to calculate the matrix elements , we use the wave functions obtained by solving the schdinger equation for the unperturbed hamiltonian with the original parameters for the quarkonia , @xmath33 and @xmath34  gev / fm , and we assume that @xmath139 orients to the @xmath140 direction and take @xmath141 for the 1p state .",
    "then we find the finite size correction calculated by perturbation theory to be @xmath142 this shows that the finite size effect reduces the excitation energy , and the magnitude of the correction is to be order of 0.1 gev for the diquark size 1 fm , although 1 fm should not be a small enough value for perturbative calculation but we could learn the order of magnitude of the size effect . in this calculation",
    "the angle between @xmath139 and @xmath132 is a dynamical valuable and we do not fix the orientation of the diquark against the charm quark direction .    in the second estimation ,",
    "we fix the angle between @xmath139 and @xmath132 to be orthogonal , but we solve the schrdinger equation fully . with this assumption",
    "the potential is written as @xmath143 where @xmath134 is the parameter for the diquark size and this potential is a function of the distance between the charm quark and diquark , @xmath95 .",
    "it can be understood from this potential that , for @xmath144 , the charm quark is located between two light quarks and , consequently , color forces between the charm quark and the light quarks have opposite directions and the forces are to be neutralized .",
    "thus , around the center the color electric force between the charm quark and the diquark is less attractive that the case of the point - like diquark . for @xmath145",
    ", @xmath134 would be negligible and we recover the original potential for the point - like diquark . solving the schrdinger equation with @xmath57 and @xmath34 gev / fm , we find the @xmath0 excitation energy to be 0.341 gev for @xmath146 fm and 0.273 gev for @xmath147 fm , which should be compared with 0.464 for @xmath148 fm .",
    "again we find that the finite size correction reduces the excitation energy and the diquark size 0.5 fm reproduces a reasonable value for the excitation energy , which is consistent with the finding for the finite size diquark in refs .",
    "the reason of the suppression of the excitation energy for the finite size diquark is the following ; as discussed above , for @xmath144 the attraction between the charm quark and the diquark gets weaker , and in such a case the distribution of the @xmath0 wave function spread out more than the case of the point - like diquark .",
    "this makes the centrifugal force less effective .",
    "thus , the orbital excitation energy is reduced for the finite size diquark . for final conclusions",
    ", we should investigate the @xmath0 spectrum more precisely , for instance , by considering orbital and radial excited states more and the @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "for quantitatively more precise argument , we should perform three - body calculation by regarding three quarks as dynamical objects , which is , however , beyond the scope of this brief report . here",
    "we just mention that the finite size effect can be a solution of the overestimation problem for the excitation energies , and that the diquark should have color polarization .",
    "we have examined the excitation energy of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons in the quark - diquark model . in this model , @xmath0 and @xmath1 composed of a heavy quark and a scalar @xmath2 diquark with the @xmath76 configuration for the flavor and color spaces , and these constituents",
    "are confined by the coulomb and linear potential .",
    "we have found that the confinement potential suitable for the meson system overestimates the @xmath0 and @xmath1 excitation energies , if we assume a point - like diquark .",
    "we also find that , in order to reproduce the @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra , the string tension should be half as strong as in the meson case .",
    "this implies that if one takes the quark - diquark model for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons with a point - like diquark , one should take such a smaller string tension for the quark - diquark system .",
    "this would give us an interesting question why the quark - diquark system should have such a smaller string tension , because the color electric confinement potential is considered to be universal for the same color configuration .",
    "we have estimated the decay width of the @xmath0 excited state based on gamov theory of the nuclear alpha decay using the wkb approximation .",
    "we have found that the result obtained in this model is consistent with the experiment and this supports the smaller string tension for the quark - diquark model .",
    "the overestimation of the @xmath0 excitation energy with the confinement potential suitable for the meson spectra could be resolved by introducing the finite size for the diquark . in this case , for short distance of the heavy quark and the diquark , the color forces between the heavy quark and the light quarks in the diquark have opposite directions and are to be canceled .",
    "thus the interaction between the heavy quark and the diquark for short distance is less attractive .",
    "this makes the relative distance of the quark and diquark larger in the @xmath0 wave function , and the centrifugal force gets less effective .",
    "we have estimated the finite size effect to the @xmath0 excitation energy in two ways .",
    "one is to use perturbation theory , and the other is to fix the diquark orientation . both calculations can be done within a simple two - body model . with these calculation , we have found that the finite size effect reduces the excitation energy and the reduction magnitude would be 0.1 gev to 0.2 gev for the diquark size 1 fm .",
    "this is a reasonable value to solve the overestimation .",
    "thus , this finding can be one of the confirmations of the finite size diquark in heavy baryons and implies that the diquark should have color polarization . for more precise argument for the diquark size ,",
    "we certainly need full three body calculation .",
    "we have also calculated the excitation energy of @xmath3 as a system of a charm quark and a strange diquark .",
    "we have found that the excitation energy of @xmath3 is moderately smaller that that of @xmath0 .",
    "this is consistent with our intuition that a heavier particle is harder to be excited , but it is inconsistent with the experimental observation in which the @xmath3 excitation energy is slightly larger than that of @xmath0 .",
    "we hope that these findings give us a good chance to reconsider the nature of the confinement force in baryon for excitation spectra of heavy baryons and the feature of diquark in heavy baryons .",
