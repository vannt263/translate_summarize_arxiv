    "turbulence , hailed as one of the last major unsolved problems of classical physics , has been the subject of numerous publications as researchers seek to understand the underlying physics , structures , and mechanisms inherent to the flow @xcite . the standard test problem for wall - bounded studies",
    "historically has been turbulent channel flow because of its simple geometry and computational efficiency .",
    "even though much insight has been achieved through the study of turbulent channel flow , it remains an academic problem because of its infinite ( computationally periodic ) spanwise direction .",
    "the next simplest geometry is turbulent pipe flow , which is of interest because of its real - world applications and its slightly different dynamics .",
    "the three major differences between turbulent pipe and channel flow are that pipe flow displays a log layer , but overshoots the theoretical profile until a much higher reynolds numbers ( @xmath1 for a channel versus @xmath2 for a pipe @xcite ) , has an observed higher critical reynolds number , and is linearly stable to an infinitesimal disturbance @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , few direct numerical simulations of turbulent pipe flow have been carried out because of the complexity in handling the numerical radial singularity at the origin .",
    "although the singularity itself is avoidable , its presence causes standard high - order spectral methods to fail to converge exponentially . as a result",
    ", only a handful of algorithms found in the literature for turbulent pipe flow ; the first reported use for each algorithm is listed in table [ radialdiscr ] .",
    "these algorithms typically use a low - order expansion in the radial direction . only shan et al .",
    "@xcite using concentric chebyshev domains ( `` piecemeal '' ) and loulou et al .",
    "@xcite using basis spline ( b - spline ) polynomials provide a higher - order examination of turbulent pipe flow . using a spectral element method",
    ", this study provides not only a high - order examination but the first exponentially convergent investigation of turbulent pipe flow through direct numerical simulation ( dns ) .",
    "[ radialdiscr ]    with this dns result , one of the studies that can be performed with the full flow field and time history it provides is an analysis based on an orthogonal decomposition method . in such methods , the flow is expanded in terms of a natural or preferred turbulent basis .",
    "one method used frequently in the field of turbulence is karhunen - love ( kl ) decomposition , which uses a two - point spatial correlation tensor to generate the eigenfunctions of the flow .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as proper orthogonal decomposition , empirical orthogonal function , or empirical eigenfunction analysis .",
    "work in this area was pioneered by lumley , who was the first to use the kl method in homogeneous turbulence @xcite .",
    "this method was later applied to turbulent channel flow in a series of papers by ball , sirovich , and keefe @xcite and sirovich , ball , and handler @xcite , who discovered plane waves and propagating structures that play an essential role in the production of turbulence through bursting or sweeping events . to study the interactions of the propagating structures ,",
    "researchers have examined minimal expansions of a turbulent flow @xcite .",
    "these efforts have led to recent work by webber et al .",
    "@xcite , who examined the energy dynamics between kl modes and discovered the energy transfer path from the applied pressure gradient to the flow through triad interactions of kl modes .",
    "this present study uses a spectral element navier - stokes solver to generate a globally high - order turbulent pipe flow data set .",
    "the karhunen - love method is used to examine the turbulent flow structures and dynamics of turbulent pipe flow .",
    "the direct numerical simulation of the three - dimensional time dependent navier - stokes equations is a computationally intensive task .",
    "by fully resolving the necessary time and spatial scales of turbulent flow , however , no subgrid dissipation model is needed , and thus a turbulent flow is calculated directly from the equations .",
    "dns has one main advantage over experiments , in that the whole flow field and time history are known , enabling analyses such as the karhunen - love decomposition .",
    "because of the long time integration and the grid resolution necessary for dns , a high - order ( typically spectral ) method is often used to keep numerical round - off and dissipation error small .",
    "spectral methods and spectral elements use trial functions that are infinitely and analytically differentiable to span the element .",
    "this approach decreases the global error exponentially with respect to resolution , in contrast to an algebraic decrease with standard methods such as finite difference or finite element methods @xcite .",
    "this study uses a spectral element navier - stokes solver that has been developed over the past 20 years @xcite to solve the navier - stokes equations : @xmath3 in the above equations , @xmath4 is the velocity vector corresponding to the radial , azimuthal , and streamwise direction respectively ; re@xmath5 is the reynolds number ; @xmath6 is the radius of the pipe ; @xmath7 is the kinematic viscosity ; and @xmath8 is the shear velocity based upon the wall shear stress @xmath9 and density @xmath10 .",
    "this solver employs a geometrically flexible yet exponentially convergent spectral element discretization in space , in this case allowing the geometry to be fitted to a cylinder .",
    "the domain is subdivided into elements , each containing high - order ( usually 1113 ) legendre lagrangian interpolants .",
    "the resulting data localisation allows for minimal communication between elements , and therefore efficient parallelization .",
    "time discretization is done with third - order operator splitting methods , and the remaining tensor - product polynomial bases are solved by using conjugate gradient iteration with scalable jacobi and hybrid schwarz / multigrid preconditioning @xcite .",
    "spectral elements are effective in cylindrical geometries @xcite and their use elegantly avoids the radial singularity at the origin . the mesh is structured as a box near the origin and transitions to a circle near the pipe walls ( figure [ grid ] ) , maintaining a globally high - order method at both the wall and the origin .",
    "in addition to avoiding the numerical error associated with the singularity , the method also avoids the time - step restriction due to the smaller element width at the origin of a polar - cylindrical coordinate system , which could lead to potential violations of the courant - friedrichs - levy stability criteria .",
    "= 2 in    each slice , as shown in figure [ grid ] , has 64 elements , and there are 40 slices stacked in the streamwise direction , adding up to a length of 20r .",
    "each element has 12th - order legendre polynomials in each direction for re@xmath0 .",
    "this discretization results in 4.4 million degrees of freedom . near the wall , the grid spacing normalised by wall units ( @xmath11 ) denoted by the superscript @xmath12 is @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is",
    "the radius and @xmath16 is the azimuthal angle . near the centre of the pipe",
    ", the spacing in cartesian coordinates is @xmath17 .",
    "the streamwise grid spacing is a constant @xmath18 throughout the domain where @xmath19 is the streamwise coordinate .",
    "benchmarking was performed at re@xmath21 with the experiments and dns of eggels et al . @xcite and the dns of fukagata and kasagi @xcite . for this higher reynolds number flow , 14th - order polynomials",
    "were used , giving grid spacings near the wall of @xmath22 and * @xmath23 , @xmath24 * in the centre , and @xmath25 .",
    "eggels et al .",
    "and fukagata and kasagi used a spectral fourier discretization in the azimuthal and axial directions and then a 2nd - order finite difference discretization in the radial direction .",
    "also , both groups used a domain length of 10r and grid sizes in their dns studies of @xmath26 for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath19 directions , respectively .",
    "the turbulent flow was tripped with a solenoidal disturbance , and the simulation was run until transition was complete .",
    "this was estimated by examining the mean flow and root - mean - squared statistics over sequential periods of 100 @xmath27 until a statistically steady state was achieved , marked by a change of less than 1 percent between the current and previous period . in this case , it took @xmath28 to arrive at a statistically steady state .",
    "convergence was checked by examining the total fluctuating energy after 1000 time steps for increasing polynomial orders 8 , 10 , 12 , and 14 with a fixed number of elements ( 2560 ) .",
    "the absolute value of the difference of the total fluctuating energy for each simulation and the value obtained using 16th order polynomials was plotted versus the total number of degrees of freedom in figure [ convergence ] .",
    "the exponential decay of the error with increasing degrees of freedom shows that our spectral element algorithm achieves geometric or exponential convergence .",
    "=3 in    the mean flow profiles in figure [ mean_180 ] correspond well with the hot wire anemometry ( hwa ) results of eggels et al .",
    "@xcite , but as seen in the root - mean - squared ( rms ) statistics shown in figure [ rms_180 ] , the spectral element calculation shows a lower peak @xmath29 and higher peak @xmath30 and @xmath31 compared to the hwa , particle image velocimetry ( piv ) , and laser doppler anemometry ( lda ) results .",
    "these results are in contrast to those with channel flow , as reported by gullbrand @xcite , where the 2nd order finite difference methods undershoot the spectral method wall - normal velocity rms .    when compared to the experimental results of eggels et al .",
    "@xcite , the spectral element results are in better agreement than the 2nd - order finite difference results .",
    "we note that eggels et al .",
    "report that their ( piv ) system had difficulties capturing @xmath32 near the wall and near the centerline of the pipe due to reflection , which could explain the deviation of all of the dns results in that area .    .",
    "the theoretical line is the law of the wall @xmath33 and the log layer @xmath34 .",
    "deviations from the log layer are expected in turbulent pipe flow until much higher reynolds numbers.,width=4 ]    a second major difference our spectral element method and the previous pipe dns using 2nd - order finite difference is the domain size . with the spectral element method , which results in a global high - order convergence , a domain size of 10r yielded unphysical results in the flow , as seen in the bulge in the azimuthal @xmath30 in figure [ l10 ] at @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this unphysical result arose even with a more refined grid , and is therefore not a function of under - resolution .",
    "however , when the domain of the spectral element method was extended to 20r , this problem disappeared .",
    "we surmise that the 2nd - order finite difference method dissipated some large - scale structures after 10r that the higher - order spectral element case appropriately resolves .",
    "this undissipated structure , because of the periodic boundary conditions , then re - enters the inlet and causes the unphysical bulges in the azimuthal rms profile .",
    "this result is also supported by the work of jimnez @xcite in turbulent channel flow ( re@xmath37=180 ) that shows large - scale structures that extend well past the domain size of @xmath38 .",
    "this benchmark confirms that the spectral element algorithm , at the given grid resolution and domain size , will generate the appropriate turbulent flow field and time history to perform the kl decomposition .",
    "= 4 in      for completeness , the karhunen - love decomposition method is briefly described here , but for more detail , see @xcite .",
    "the karhunen - love method is the solution of the two - point velocity correlation kernel equation defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fluctuating component of the velocity and where the mean @xmath41 is determined by averaging over both homogeneous planes and time .",
    "the angle brackets represent an average over many time steps , on the order of @xmath42 , to sample the the entire attractor .",
    "the @xmath43 denotes the outer product , establishing the kernel as the velocity two - point correlation between every spatial point @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    for turbulent pipe flow , with two homogeneous directions providing translational invariance in the @xmath16 ( azimuthal ) and @xmath19 ( streamwise ) direction , eq .",
    "( [ two_point ] ) becomes @xmath46 thus , given the kernel in eq .",
    "( [ two_point_pipe ] ) , the eigenfunctions have the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the azimuthal wavenumber and @xmath49 the streamwise wavenumber .",
    "the determination of @xmath50 is then given by    @xmath51    where the @xmath52 denotes the complex conjugate , @xmath53 is the eigenvalue , and @xmath54 is the fourier transform of the fluctuating velocity in the azimuthal and axial direction .    in the present problem ,",
    "2,100 snapshots of the flow field were taken , corresponding to one snapshot every eight viscous time steps ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the results of each snapshot were projected to an evenly spaced grid with @xmath56 points in @xmath57 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the fourier transform of the data was then taken and the kernel assembled .",
    "this kernel was averaged over every snapshot to generate the final kernel to be decomposed .",
    "since the dimension of k is 303 ( given by three velocity components on 101 radial grid points ) there are 303 eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for each fourier wavenumber pair @xmath58 .",
    "the eigenfunctions are ranked in descending order with the quantum number @xmath59 to specify the particular eigenfunction associated with the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "thus , it requires a triplet @xmath60 to specify a given eigenfunction .    the eigenfunctions @xmath61 are complex vector functions and are normalised so that the inner product of the full eigenfunction @xmath62 is of unit length , namely @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the eigenvalues physically represent the average energy of the flow captured by the eigenfunction @xmath62 ,    @xmath65    we note that the eigenfunctions , as an orthogonal expansion of the flow field , retain the properties of the flow field , such as incompressibility and boundary conditions of no slip at the wall .",
    "the pipe flow is statistically invariant under azimuthal reflection ,    @xmath66    and taking advantage of it reduces the total number of calculations as well as the memory and storage requirements .",
    "we note that , because of its geometry , turbulent channel flow has two more symmetries  a vertical reflection , and a x - axis rotation  that are not present in the pipe , since a negative radius is equivalent to a 180 degree rotation in the azimuthal direction .",
    "a major consequence of this symmetry is that the resulting eigenfunctions are also symmetric , and the modes with azimuthal wave number @xmath48 will be the azimuthal reflection of the modes with wave number @xmath67 ,    @xmath68    thus reducing the total computational memory needed for this calculation .",
    "the kl method provides an orthogonal set of eigenfunctions that span the flow field . as such",
    ", the method allows the flow field to be represented as an expansion in that basis ,    @xmath69    with @xmath70 since the fourier modes are orthogonal to each other , equation [ coeff ] becomes    @xmath71    with @xmath72 being the fourier transform of @xmath73 in the azimuthal and streamwise direction with wavenumbers @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the time history of the eigenfunctions can be used to examine their interactions , such as the energy interaction examined by webber et al .",
    "@xcite and bursting events by sirovich et al .",
    "this section presents the results of our analysis of turbulent pipe flow based on kl decomposition .",
    "dns was performed for @xmath74 .",
    "the reynolds number based on the centreline velocity is @xmath75 and based on the mean velocity is @xmath76 .",
    "this range is above the observed critical reynolds number for pipe flow and exhibits self - sustaining turbulence , as seen from the fluctuating time history of the mean velocity shown in figure [ mean_time ] .",
    "the velocity profile , seen in figure [ mean_profile ] , shows the mean velocity with respect to wall units away from the wall ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the profile fits the law of the wall but fails to conform to the log law , and as mentioned in section 1 , the log law is not expected for turbulent pipe flow until much higher reynolds number .",

    "the streamwise fluctuations peak near @xmath78 .",
    "the azimuthal and axial velocities show a weaker peak near @xmath79 and @xmath35 , respectively , and then remain fairly flat throughout the pipe .",

    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the energy spectra of the propagating mode subclasses are shown in figure [ distribe ] .",
    "this shows that the tail wavenumber end of the inertial range is populated primarily by the lift modes and the low end of the spectra is populated predominantly by the wall modes .",
    "the physical meaning of this is that the energy starts at the wall with large scale structures and is lifted away from the wall into the outer region in small scale structures , represented by the lifting modes .",
    "the effect of higher radial quantum number @xmath82 is more zero crossings of the velocities in the radial direction .",
    "the effect on the location of coherent vorticity and the number of vortex cores scales with the radial quantum number @xmath59 , making the subclasses invariant with @xmath59 . the wall and lift modes retain their characteristics , in that even with more vortices , they remain close to the wall for the wall mode and close to the centreline for the lift modes , shown in figures [ 623non ] through [ 265non ] .",

    "although the karhunen - love method yields a preferred or natural basis for turbulence , one must be careful in the conclusions drawn from the results , as any structure or feature can be reconstructed from any given orthogonal basis .",
    "the strength of this method is that it is the most optimal basis , and by focusing on the most energetic modes a low order dynamical representation of the flow is realised .",
    "this low order dynamical system reveals three important results , and paints a picture of the energy dynamics in turbulent pipe flow .",
    "the first result is the constant phase speed of the propagating modes .",
    "this was also found in studies of turbulent channel flow , as the structures represented by the basis advect with a constant group velocity , the same average velocity of burst events @xcite .",
    "the normal speed locus of the propagating waves is shown in figure [ locus ] for the propagating modes found in the top 50 most energetic modes .",
    "for this , the phase speed @xmath83 is plotted in the direction @xmath84 .",
    "the locus is nearly circular , which is evidence that these structures propagate as a wave packet or envelope that travels with speed of * @xmath85 * , the point at which the circle intersects the x - axis in figure [ locus ] , which corresponds to the mean velocity in the buffer region at @xmath86 .    .",
    "the circle is a least - squares fit to the data and represents that the wave packets are acting together as a group with speed of 8.41 @xmath87 , the point where the circle intersects the y - axis.,width=4 ]    the second interesting result is that none of the modes with azimuthal wave number @xmath88 exhibit any travelling waves near the wall , and are without exception a streamwise or inclined streamwise vortex in the outer region .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath88 mode does not allow for a near - wall travelling wave as found by kerswell @xcite , and as such , the basis expansions for these modes have only near - centreline structures .",
    "the third result of note is that the different kl structures , as observed from our results , can be seen qualitatively as an expansion that represents the horseshoe ( hairpin ) vortex representation of turbulent structures .",
    "this horseshoe structure is supported by a large number of researchers in the turbulence community as the self - sustaining mechanism for turbulence @xcite . in the representative horseshoe structure ( see , for example ,",
    "the figure by theodorsen @xcite ) , the structures found in the kl can be seen .",
    "the wall modes represent the leg structure and its perturbation near the wall .",
    "the lift modes represent the structure lifting off the wall .",
    "the asymmetric modes represent the secondary and tertiary horseshoes that are formed .",
    "the turn modes represent the spanwise head of the horseshoe . as mentioned before , since the kl decomposition forms a basis , any flow can be recreated from these eigenmodes , so this result",
    "is reported as an interesting qualitative result , and as an understanding that the propagating modes are the structures of interest in turbulence .    the final dynamical picture of the kl modes in summarising the work done by kerswell @xcite , webber et al .",
    "@xcite , sirovich et al .",
    "@xcite , and this current work is as follows .",
    "webber et al . found that the energy enters the flow from the pressure gradient to the shear modes .",
    "the shear modes , interacting with the roll modes present in fully developed turbulence transfers the energy from the shear modes to the roll modes . shown in this study , and theoretically by kerswell",
    ", the roll modes decay much more slowly than the propagating modes . because of this slow decay",
    ", these streamwise rolls provide an energy storage role in the turbulence , similar to a capacitance .",
    "this allows enough time for the roll to interact with the propagating wave packet shown by sirovich et al . because this interaction requires a finite time to occur , the energy storage and slow decaying nature of the streamwise rolls play an integral role in the self - sustaining nature of turbulence .",
    "it is also surmised that the travelling modes found by kerswell and other researchers are represented in the kl formulation as the most unstable wave packet of kl modes .",
    "following again the work of webber et al . and applying the classifications found in this study , the majority of the energy from the roll modes are transferred to the wall modes .",
    "the wall modes then interact with themselves through an asymmetric mode catalyst , and with the lift modes through a ring mode catalyst .",
    "physically , this gives a picture of wall turbulence energy being transferred near the wall and then lifted up to the outer layer .",
    "this interaction between the wall and the lift modes is what populates the inertial range shown in figure [ distribe ] .",
    "the energy is ultimately dissipated by viscosity , faster for the higher wavenumber modes .",
    "we have presented the use of the karhunen - love expansion method with the results of a globally high - order direct numerical simulation of turbulent pipe flow .",
    "the results reveal the structure of the turbulent pipe flow as propagating ( 80.58% total energy ) and non propagating modes ( 19.42% total energy ) .",
    "the propagating modes are characterised by a constant phase speed and have four distinct classes : wall , lift , asymmetric , and ring modes .",
    "these propagating modes form a travelling wave envelope , forming a circular , normal - speed locus , with advection speed of @xmath85 corresponding to the mean velocity in the buffer region near @xmath86 .",
    "the non propagating modes have two subclasses : streamwise roll and shear modes .",
    "these represent the energy storage and mean fluctuations of the turbulent flow , respectively .",
    "the energy is transferred from the streamwise rolls to the wall modes first , and then later to the lift modes , physically representing the energy transfer from the wall to the outer region .",
    "this eigenfunction expansion , using both their structure and their time - dependent coefficients , provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of turbulent pipe flow , and will provide a basis for further analysis and comparison leading to understanding the mechanism of drag reduction by spanwise wall oscillation @xcite and the mechanism of relaminarization @xcite .",
