    "<S> # 1 * 2    introduction    lattice qcd is so far the most successful method of calculating hadronic observables from the theory of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> however , computational limitations mean that hadronic observables are calculated on the lattice at quark masses larger than their physical values . hence results from lattice simulations can not be directly compared with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> although , with improvements in actions , algorithms and computer speed , future lattice calculations will be performed much closer to the physical regime , these improvements will proceed over many years . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to make sense of any lattice results produced to date , and to compare them with experiment , one must understand how to extrapolate lattice results , obtained at large quark masses , to the physical world .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the difficulties with calculating hadronic observables at heavy quark masses on the lattice is that chiral perturbation theory can not be applied in this quark mass regime . </S>",
    "<S> however , chiral expansions of hadronic observables contain important non - analytic terms as a function of the quark mass , @xmath1 ( or equivalently of @xmath2 , as @xmath3 in this range ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is vital that this non - analytic behaviour is included in _ any _ extrapolation to the physical regime @xcite@xcite .    the chiral expansion of the squared electric charge radius of a spin-1/2 octet baryon includes non - analytic behaviour in the form of logarithmic terms in @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> to extrapolate the lattice results for electric charge radii we incorporate these logarithmic terms in our extrapolation formulae , while ensuring that the correct heavy quark behaviour is also maintained . a similar approach </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has been successful in explaining why lattice simulations of pion and proton charge radii are similar in size , while experimental measurements reveal a significant difference . </S>",
    "<S> the dramatic differences in the chiral behaviour of the pion and proton charge radii account for the similarity of the lattice results at moderately heavy pion masses , while allowing good agreement with experiment at the physical pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> this illustrates the importance of including meson cloud effects in extrapolations of lattice results to the physical regime . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we improve the formalism of chiral extrapolations by incorporating both chiral symmetry and heavy quark effective theory .    </S>",
    "<S> our lattice `` data '' for the electric charge radii is taken from the calculations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions to the charge radii from individual quark flavours are also given there . </S>",
    "<S> these results are the only available lattice calculations of the electric charge radii of spin-1/2 octet baryons . for each baryon , </S>",
    "<S> the electric charge radius was calculated at three different quark masses , corresponding to rather heavy pion masses ( all exceeding 600  mev ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we extrapolate these results as functions of the squared pion mass , @xmath2 , to obtain predictions for the charge radii at the physical pion mass ( 139  mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> because the lattice calculations are quenched , we expect that there are errors in the lattice data which we have been unable to take into account . </S>",
    "<S> however , we expect that errors from the quenching approximation will be rather small . at the quark masses considered on the lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the dominant effect is a simple renormalization of the strong coupling constant , accounted for in setting the lattice spacing scale . </S>",
    "<S> when results from unquenched simulations become available , the formalism presented here may be readily applied .    </S>",
    "<S> extrapolations[sec : extrap ]    dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry in the qcd lagrangian results in the formation of an octet of ( pseudo- ) goldstone bosons . </S>",
    "<S> goldstone boson loops give rise to significant non - analytic behaviour in hadronic observables , such as @xmath6 and magnetic moments , as a function of the quark mass , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> using an expansion about the chiral su(3 ) limit gives the following expression for the squared electric charge radius , @xmath7 , of a spin-1/2 octet baryon ( labelled by @xmath8 ) @xcite = _ i + _ x=,k ( ) +  . </S>",
    "<S> [ chiralexp ] here @xmath9 is the pion decay constant ( 93  mev ) and @xmath10 is the scale of the dimensional regularization . </S>",
    "<S> ( the value of @xmath11 is clearly correlated with the choice of @xmath10 . ) unlike su(2)-flavour symmetry , su(3 ) is significantly broken in the physical world , with the strange quark mass the same order of magnitude as @xmath12 for low - energy phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> the squared kaon mass exceeds the squared pion mass by over an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> given that the source of the meson cloud associated with a baryon is of a finite size , one might anticipate that the role of the kaon cloud will be suppressed away from the su(3 ) chiral limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the form factor describing the finite size of the kaon source will act to suppress kaon loop effects like @xmath13 at large @xmath14 ( comparable to @xmath15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this was demonstrated within a particular chiral quark model for the nucleon magnetic moments in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> despite the model - dependence associated with the form factors , the lattice results themselves are very slowly varying functions of @xmath14 at values of the order @xmath15 or higher , thus supporting the general conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> therefore kaon loop effects are expected to be small and slowly varying as a function of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> hence we do not explicitly include kaon contributions in our extrapolation formulae . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , since @xmath4 varies rapidly with @xmath5 , the leading non - analytic behaviour in @xmath4 must be included explicitly in an extrapolation to the chiral regime .    to extrapolate the lattice calculations of the electric charge radii of the spin-1/2 octet baryons </S>",
    "<S> , we consider two distinct fitting procedures . </S>",
    "<S> both these extrapolation schemes satisfy the constraints of chiral perturbation theory and heavy quark effective theory . the first extrapolation procedure we investigate </S>",
    "<S> is given simply by the formula 2 = , [ full ] where @xmath6 are the lattice qcd results ( at several values of @xmath4 ) extracted from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are fit parameters chosen to best fit these results , @xmath18 ( corresponding to the @xmath19 baryon ) is fixed ( model - independently ) by chiral perturbation theory and @xmath20 , which is directly correlated with @xmath16 , is fixed at 1  gev . </S>",
    "<S> this extrapolation procedure is not feasible for the neutral baryons because @xmath21 as @xmath4 becomes large and thus sensitivity to the @xmath17 fit parameter is lost . in order to extrapolate the neutral baryon charge radii results we consider a second extrapolation procedure , focusing on individual quark `` sector '' ( or quark flavour ) contributions , as discussed below .    clearly </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolation formula given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ full ] ) builds in the correct chiral behaviour in the su(2 ) limit , since in the limit @xmath22 it can be expanded as follows 2 = c_1 + _ i ( ) - c_2 ^ 2 +  [ chiral ] ( recall that the scale @xmath20 , in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) , has been set to 1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this choice is also implicit in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6)-(10 ) , below , where @xmath23 in the logarithm must be in gev . ) </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with the chiral su(2 ) expansion of the squared electric charge radius ( see eq .  ( [ chiralexp ] ) ) , provided we fix the coefficient @xmath18 to @xmath24 for the @xmath19 baryon . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath18 are given in table  [ table : chi ] .    </S>",
    "<S> in the large @xmath5 limit , we expect that the quarks behave non - relativistically , and the squared charge radius falls off as @xmath26 , as it does in non - relativistic quantum mechanics . in the region </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath5 is very large , @xmath27 , and hence we require that 2 , [ large ] as @xmath4 becomes extremely large . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly satisfied by our first extrapolation formula , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ full ] ) , since the logarithm is very slowly varying .    in the second extrapolation procedure </S>",
    "<S> we deal separately with the individual quark sector contributions to the baryon charge radii . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the case of the nucleons , we extrapolate the up and down sector contributions separately . for the hyperons </S>",
    "<S> the strange and light sector results are extrapolated separately . </S>",
    "<S> this avoids the problem encountered with the neutral baryons which was mentioned previously , because now all the quantities being extrapolated are charged , even if the overall charge on the baryon is zero . </S>",
    "<S> this separation is valid because the squared electric charge radius can be decomposed as 2 = _ q = u , d , se_q , where @xmath28 is the contribution from the @xmath29 quark sector and @xmath30 is the charge of this quark sector . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , provided that the extrapolation formulae from each sector add so that the chiral and heavy quark limits of the sum are in agreement with eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chiralexp ] ) and ( [ large ] ) respectively , this method contains the same physics as the first method , but simply makes use of the extra information contained in the individual quark sector results . </S>",
    "<S> not only does this second extrapolation procedure solve the neutral baryon extrapolation difficulty , it also provides predictions for individual quark sector radii , which will be resolved at jefferson lab for the nucleon @xcite , and perhaps future accelerator facilities for hyperons .    </S>",
    "<S> isolation of the individual quark sector contributions to the charge radii is relatively straightforward from the theoretical point of view . </S>",
    "<S> for example , to isolate the @xmath31-sector contribution to the charge radius of the proton one simply sets the @xmath32-quark charge to zero and calculates the proton charge radius as if only the @xmath31 quark carried charge . in the chiral expansion of the proton charge radius , the coefficient of the logarithm , @xmath33 , originates from the pion loop , @xmath34 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pionl ] ) , and includes the charge of the pion cloud . therefore , to extrapolate the @xmath31-sector contribution to the proton charge radius , </S>",
    "<S> the appropriate coefficient of the logarithm is @xmath35 , since the pion now carries charge @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we extrapolate the @xmath31-sector results of the proton according to 2  e_u = [ usector ] where @xmath33 is the full chiral coefficient of the proton , given in table  [ table : chi ] and @xmath37 is the squared charge radius of a single @xmath31-quark of unit charge . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the @xmath32-sector results are extrapolated according to e_d = [ dsector ] where the factor of @xmath38 originates from the @xmath39 contribution to the pion cloud . clearly adding the left hand sides of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ usector ] ) and ( [ dsector ] ) yields the full expression for @xmath40 . in the chiral limit </S>",
    "<S> the right hand sides add so that the correct chiral form for @xmath40 , given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chiral ] ) , is retained . the sum of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ usector ] ) and ( [ dsector ] ) also obeys the correct heavy quark behaviour , given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ large ] ) . since the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath41 are not necessarily the same , the individual quark sector extrapolation formulae ( eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ usector ] ) and ( [ dsector ] ) ) can not be added directly to give eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ full ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in general we do not expect the two extrapolation procedures to give exactly the same results . for the charged baryons </S>",
    "<S> this may be used to help quantify the systematic error of the approach . for the neutron , </S>",
    "<S> the analogous extrapolation functions are given by e_u = , for the @xmath31-quark sector , and 2 e_d = , for the @xmath32-quark sector results , where @xmath42 is given in table  [ table : chi ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider extrapolating the hyperon charge radii results using the second extrapolation procedure , i.e. , extrapolating the strange and light quark sector results separately . in extrapolating the strange quark sector the charges of the light quarks </S>",
    "<S> are set to zero . </S>",
    "<S> since the logarithmic term considered here originates from pionic corrections to the charge radius ( and pions do not contain strange quarks ) , the coefficient of the logarithm in the strange sector extrapolation will be zero . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for the light sector extrapolation , strange quarks do not carry charge and hence the coefficient of the logarithm in this extrapolation will be the full coefficient , @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the following extrapolation formulae for the hyperon quark sector contributions e_l = [ l ] and e_s = [ s ] where @xmath8 runs over the hyperons only , and @xmath44 corresponds to the light - quark ( @xmath31 and/or @xmath32 ) sector . since the strange quark mass is held fixed in the light quark mass extrapolation , any variation in the strange quark sector </S>",
    "<S> is purely an environment effect from the surrounding light quarks . </S>",
    "<S> as such , the functional form for the strange quark sector is constrained by neither leading order chiral perturbation theory nor heavy quark effective theory . as we shall see , @xmath41 is small and negative for each hyperon , which suggests that a simple linear ansatz for the strange quark sector extrapolation could also have been used .    </S>",
    "<S> .baryon electric charge radii and the quark sector contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are defined on the left hand sides of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ usector])-([s ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one - loop corrected estimates of @xmath45 ( in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chiralexp ] ) ) and @xmath18 ( in units of @xmath46 ) for each octet baryon are indicated . for each extrapolation , </S>",
    "<S> the fit parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the predicted value of @xmath47 at the physical pion mass are reported . </S>",
    "<S> asterisks denote the squared charge radii reconstructed from the sum of separate quark sector extrapolations . </S>",
    "<S> ( the units are such that the pion mass is in gev and the squared charge radius in @xmath46 . ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     results    the lattice qcd simulations were performed on a @xmath48 periodic lattice using standard wilson actions at @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> dirichlet boundary conditions were used for fermions in the time direction . </S>",
    "<S> twenty - eight quenched gauge configurations were generated by the cabibbo - marinari @xcite pseudo - heat - bath method . </S>",
    "<S> the conserved vector current was derived from the wilson fermion action via the noether procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the associated lattice ward identity protects this vector current from renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> the radii were produced by fitting the electric form factor to dipole and monopole forms , allowing a charge radius to be extracted in each case . </S>",
    "<S> since it is known from experiment that the dipole form is more suitable for parameterizing the electric form factor , we consider only the dipole results here . </S>",
    "<S> statistical uncertainties in the lattice simulation results are calculated in a third - order , single elimination jackknife @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further details may be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolations of lattice calculations for the charge radii of the spin-1/2 baryon octet are shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : prot][fig : xim ] . extrapolations of baryon charge radii results , performed according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ full ] ) , are indicated by the solid lines , where the full circles ( @xmath50 ) represent the baryon charge radii from lattice qcd and the extrapolated value at @xmath51  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the individual quark sector extrapolations are shown by the dashed and dot - dashed lines , and the baryon charge radius predicted by this method is indicated by a full square ( @xmath52 ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimental measurements are indicated at the physical pion mass by an asterisk ( @xmath53 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that for the charged baryons , two extrapolation schemes and two corresponding predicted physical values are shown , whereas ( for the reasons explained in section [ sec : extrap ] ) only one extrapolation procedure is shown for each neutral baryon .    in the case of the proton , </S>",
    "<S> the two extrapolated results agree very well with the experimental measurement . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that a traditional linear extrapolation in @xmath2 would significantly underestimate the experimental result . </S>",
    "<S> similarly the predicted charge radius for the neutron ( produced by separate extrapolations of the @xmath31- and @xmath32-sector results ) agrees with the experimental data significantly better than the prediction from a conventional linear extrapolation in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> both predicted values for @xmath0 also agree very well with the two experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> these baryons are currently the only baryons of the spin-1/2 octet whose electric charge radius has been measured .    from simple quark model arguments </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the heavier strange quark has a smaller distribution than the light quarks , we expect the hierarchy of electric charge radii of charged octet baryons to be given as follows || </S>",
    "<S> || || || clearly the results of the lattice extrapolations shown in table  [ table : chi ] are in qualitative agreement with this expectation . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in the regime of the actual lattice data ( @xmath54  mev ) the argument is even quantitative . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the chiral limit ( and physical pion mass ) is approached , the simple quark model description is no longer adequate and chiral physics gives rise to dramatic effects . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the extrapolation of the @xmath32-quark sector of the proton ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : prot ] ) , chiral effects mean that the @xmath32-quark sector can actually make a _ positive _ contribution to the charge radius , via the @xmath55 contribution in @xmath56  even though the total contribution is negative at the physical pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is not anticipated by the simple quark model .    for the neutral baryons the sign of the squared charge radius is important . </S>",
    "<S> in the neutron , the two @xmath32 quarks are most likely to be found in a spin 1 configuration , where they will undergo hyperfine repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a small , negative charge radius squared . </S>",
    "<S> however , as one approaches the chiral limit , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , in particular the process @xmath57 , which carries @xmath32-quarks to larger radii and screens the @xmath31-quark contribution via the @xmath58 in the @xmath59 , leads to an enhancement of the negative charge radius . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining neutral baryons , @xmath60 , @xmath20 and @xmath61 , have a positive squared charge radius . </S>",
    "<S> this is because in each case the strange quark distribution is more localized than the light quark charge distribution ( due to the larger mass of the strange quark ) </S>",
    "<S> . therefore on average the light quark charge distribution occurs at a larger radius , resulting in a positive charge radius ( since the light quark charge is positive in each case ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the lattice results used here were calculated with a strange quark mass of approximately 250  mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is much larger than the physical strange quark mass of @xmath62  mev at a scale 2 gev , taken from a careful analysis of qcd sum rules for @xmath63 decay @xcite . in an earlier study of lattice results for octet baryon magnetic moments @xcite ( where the results were extracted from the same lattice simulation @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> , it was found that the heavy strange quark had a significant effect on the predictions of the @xmath64 moments . </S>",
    "<S> here we expect that the heavy strange quark should also have some effect on the @xmath64 charge radii . with a strange quark mass closer to the physical mass the strange quark contribution would be increased . </S>",
    "<S> this would result in a lower predicted charge radius for the @xmath61 and a larger ( in magnitude ) charge radius for the @xmath65 . in the absence of experimental measurements we will not attempt to correct for the effect of the strange quark mass here .    as we see from table [ table : chi ] , </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolated mean square charge radii obtained from both extrapolation procedures agree quite well for each charged octet baryon . for the proton , @xmath0 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath65 the reconstructed values completely cover the result from the original extrapolations of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ full ] ) . in the case of the @xmath66 </S>",
    "<S> the two values overlap only on the error bars . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the small variation in the strange quark contribution ( which is caused by an environment effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> when this environment effect is included in the baryon charge radius , the magnitude of the slope is increased , resulting in a larger charge radius after extrapolation .    in turning the dimensionless masses calculated on the lattice to physical units , </S>",
    "<S> the lattice spacing , @xmath67 , was set in the traditional manner by fixing the nucleon mass , obtained by a naive linear extrapolation in @xmath2 , equal to the observed mass . </S>",
    "<S> of course , such a linear extrapolation is known @xcite to be inconsistent with chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that applying a more consistent chiral extrapolation would systematically lower values of @xmath47 obtained for the charged octet by of the order 15% . </S>",
    "<S> ( the effect on neutral baryons is much smaller . ) on the other hand , the data which we are forced to use is quenched data which omits some pion corrections . </S>",
    "<S> although these are expected to be suppressed at the large values of @xmath2 for which the data is available ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> ref.@xcite ) , the associated systematic error would tend to increase the calculated values of @xmath47 , perhaps by 5 - 10% . rather than attempt to repair these deficiencies in the present data , </S>",
    "<S> we feel it would be more reasonable to simply accept that there is an additional systematic error of the order 15% associated with the extrapolated values shown in table  [ table : chi ] . adding this systematic in quadrature means that the values in table  [ table : chi ] would become , for example , @xmath68  @xmath46 , @xmath69  @xmath46 , @xmath70  @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we look forward to repeating our analysis with unquenched data at lower quark mass , which is the best way to overcome these problems .    conclusion    in this paper we have investigated two methods of extrapolating lattice results for the electric charge radii of octet baryons to the physical regime . </S>",
    "<S> these procedures build in the correct leading non - analytic behaviour of the electric charge radii in the chiral limit , as well as the correct heavy quark behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> both extrapolation procedures were performed for the charged octet baryons , with the predicted values agreeing very well . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolation formulae seem to be very successful , as good agreement with experiment was obtained for the nucleons and the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we await further experimental measurements of the baryon charge radii in order to test our predictions . in the future we hope to perform similar extrapolations of electric charge radius lattice results calculated with a more realistic strange quark mass and eventually with lighter , dynamical @xmath31 and @xmath32 quarks . </S>"
