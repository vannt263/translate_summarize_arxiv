    "the problem of external acoustic scattering has recently been solved @xcite by means of the boundary algebraic equations method ( bae @xcite ) and considering a combined - field integral formulation ( cfie , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting method is , essentially , a discrete analogue of the boundary element method ( bem ) that inherits the good properties of bae and the advantages of cfie , avoiding most of the bem drawbacks .",
    "on the one hand , no quadratures of oversingular integrals have to be computed due to the discrete nature of bae . on the other hand ,",
    "the resulting integral equations are free of spurious resonances due to the cfie formulation @xcite .    however , the main drawback of the cfie ",
    "bae method is the reduction of accuracy when smooth scatterers with curved surfaces such as spheres or cylinders are considered .",
    "this is because the method is based on a regular discretisation of the space ( grid ) and the obstacles must be approximated by means of the closest brick - description .",
    "our goal here is to present a complementary formulation where the cfie  bae method is coupled with some more versatile numerical technique in order to deal with arbitrary shaped scatterers .",
    "this will typically be a thin layer of finite elements ( fem ) between the obstacle surface and a close grid - shaped boundary that surrounds the obstacle .",
    "the fem domain has on the one side the boundary conditions corresponding to the scatterer and on the other side the coupling with the cfie  bae .",
    "this acts as a method for domain truncation and exactly imposes the radiation boundary conditions .    the coupling of numerical methods in order to maximize the benefits and reduce the disadvantages of each one has been often used .",
    "see for example @xcite where the fem was complemented with a boundary integral method to deal with radiation conditions or @xcite where the stability conditions of fem ",
    "bem couplings were studied .",
    "some more recent works on the fem  bem coupling applied to the scattering of waves can be found , see for example @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of the authors knowledge , the coupling bae  fem has not been considered .",
    "the method presented here can also be understood as an alternative to impose the radiation boundary condition and truncate the computation of domains .",
    "it has the added value that the obtained solutions are ` exact ' in the sense that no numerical artefact is required . in some popular alternatives such as the perfectly matched layers ( pml )",
    "the reflected waves are attenuated by means of a virtual damping medium placed in the surrounding of the problem domain .",
    "it certainly diminishes the reflected waves but it is well know that their parameters ( i.e. complex wave number of the medium ) must be calibrated properly , see for example @xcite .",
    "moreover , evanescent waves can remain undamped ( see @xcite ) and the quality of solution can be diminished in some zones close to the layer such as the corners",
    ". the shape of the pml , the thickness of the layer and the distance from the scatterer are important aspects also for the quality of the solution and in order to derive the pml equations . on the contrary ,",
    "the approach presented here is more flexible in the sense that it is independent of the shape and the outer boundary can be placed very close to the scatterer without affecting the quality of the solution .",
    "this will be illustrated later in section  [ sec : numericalexamples ] .    in the remainder of the document ,",
    "the formulation of the problem is presented in section  [ sec : formulation ] and the method is detailed in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "its properties are shown with the numerical examples in section  [ sec : numericalexamples ] before the conclusions .",
    "the parts of the development that are not essential have been grouped in the appendices : some details of the derivation of bae equations in appendix  [ sec : appa ] and a proof of solvability in appendix  [ sec : appb ] .",
    "we consider a 2d of 3d external acoustic stationary problem .",
    "the scatterer is approximated by a surface ( or a curve ) @xmath0 .",
    "the inhomogeneous helmholtz equation @xmath1 is assumed to be fulfilled in the medium .",
    "variable @xmath2 may correspond to acoustical pressure or acoustical potential .",
    "we assume that the boundary is acoustically hard ( neumann ) .",
    "function @xmath3 represents the sources of the field , i.  e.   a radiation problem is studied .",
    "if the sources are put on the surface @xmath0 then one can study radiation of wave by a vibrating boundary .",
    "typically it is necessary to find directivity of the field as the result .",
    "we assume that the exponential factor of an outgoing wave has form of @xmath4 for big @xmath5 , where @xmath5 is the distance from the origin .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 has a vanishing positive imaginary part .",
    "thus , an outgoing wave should decay exponentially at infinity .",
    "the same property ( it is the _ radiation condition _ ) should be obeyed by any numerical approximation of  @xmath2 .    split the domain external with respect to @xmath0 into two subdomains @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( one inside another ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "the boundary between these domains , @xmath9 , should have a simple shape .",
    "for example , the interior of @xmath9 should be a union of equal cubes / squares .",
    "this property will enable us to apply the bae method to @xmath9 .",
    "the boundary @xmath9 does not correspond to any physical interface , but it divides the space into two parts , which be treated numerically in a different manner .",
    "the wave process in domain @xmath8 will be modelled by the bae method , thus giving a boundary condition ( an approximation of a dtn operator ) on @xmath9 .",
    "this boundary condition should establish the absence of waves coming from infinity on @xmath9 .",
    "the internal domain @xmath7 will be treated by a usual finite element method .",
    "we assume that all sources lie inside @xmath9 , i.  e.  belong to @xmath7 .",
    "consider the entire space @xmath10 covered with uniform ( periodic ) mesh ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , right ) .",
    "the mesh in our understanding consists of nodes and finite elements ( polygons or polyhedra ) .",
    "the set of all nodes belonging to the uniform mesh will be denoted by  @xmath11 , and the set of all finite elements by @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a domain composed of some finite elements of the uniform mesh @xmath14 .",

    "denote the set of nodes of this mesh by @xmath19 and the elements of this mesh by @xmath20 .",
    "the nodes of @xmath19 lying on the boundary @xmath9 should coincide with @xmath21 , i.  e.  the uniform mesh on @xmath8 and the arbitrary mesh on @xmath7 should form together a valid mesh on @xmath22 .",
    "also , @xmath23 .",
    "let equation @xmath24 valid in the entire space @xmath10 , be approximated on a uniform mesh @xmath25 using the finite element method .",
    "let the nodal values of @xmath2 and @xmath26 be denoted by @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "write the approximation in the form @xmath29 assume that the coefficients @xmath30 possess the following properties :    * @xmath31 only for nodes @xmath32 and @xmath33 adjacent to the same finite element ; * the matrix is symmetrical @xmath34 ; * since the mesh is periodical , the coefficients do not change when the pair of nodes is translated along the mesh .",
    "now consider the approximation of equation ( [ eq0201 ] ) in the domain @xmath22 .",
    "let this approximation be written in the form @xmath35 let the coefficients @xmath36 have the following properties :    * @xmath37 only for nodes @xmath32 and @xmath33 both belonging to the same finite element ; * the matrix is symmetrical @xmath38 ; * @xmath39 if @xmath40 and at least one of the nodes @xmath32 , @xmath33 belongs to @xmath41 .",
    "the last point means that the discretisation ( [ eq0203 ] ) is uniform in @xmath8 .",
    "since the neumann boundary condition is imposed on @xmath0 , equation ( [ eq0203 ] ) naturally incorporates the boundary condition .",
    "the method , though , can be easily modified to the case of arbitrary boundary conditions .",
    "our aim is to present a method for solving ( [ eq0203 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq0202 ] ) is auxiliary for the method .",
    "split equation ( [ eq0203 ] ) into two equations : @xmath42 @xmath43 the matrices @xmath44 , @xmath45 and the flows @xmath46 , @xmath47 should posses the following properties :    * @xmath48 if @xmath49 , and at least one of the nodes @xmath50 belongs to @xmath51 ; * @xmath52 if @xmath40 , and at least one of the nodes @xmath50 belongs to @xmath41 ; * @xmath53 if @xmath54 ; * matrices are symmetrical : @xmath55 , @xmath56 ; * @xmath57 or @xmath58 only if @xmath59 * @xmath60 if @xmath59 .",

    "it is easy to check that the function @xmath66 is a solution of ( [ eq0203 ] ) . our plan is to substitute ( [ eq0302 ] ) by a relation of the form @xmath67 for some matrix @xmath68 , and then represent ( [ eq0301 ] ) in the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71",

    "it can be convenient to solve the whole problem at the same time and avoid the explicit inversion of matrix @xmath92 .",

    "this is the expected result for the interpolation error of linear finite elements where @xmath131 , with @xmath132 a constant value @xcite .",
    "it is observed that the numerical error has a different lower bound for each curve .",
    "this value is larger for smaller scatterers ( with a more pronounced curvature compared to the element size ) due to the geometry error of the linear finite element approximation of the circular shape .",

    "linear triangles are considered for the fem layer , order two convergence is observed .",
    "this behaviour is only truncated at very low values of dimensionless wavenumber @xmath128 by the geometrical error in the discretisation of the scatterer shape or the approximation of the force vector .",
    "the coupling with fem largely reduces the numerical error of bae solutions and helps to overcome its main drawback in problems involving curve - shaped scatterers .",
    "this was caused by the staircase approximation of that shapes .",
    "that shapes are now approximated by means of standard finite elements without loosing any of the good properties of bae for scattering problems : no need to compute boundary integrals ( which are usually singular in other methods such as bem ) , non - singularity of the problem even for the spurious eigenfrequencies of the scatterer and exact representation of the domain truncation .",

    "<S> recently , a combined approach of cfie  bae has been proposed by authors for solving external scattering problems in acoustics . </S>",
    "<S> cfie stands for combined - field integral equations , and bae is the method of boundary algebraical equation . </S>",
    "<S> the combined method is , essentially , a discrete analogue of the boundary element method ( bem ) , having none of its disadvantages . </S>",
    "<S> namely , due to the discrete nature of bae one should not compute quadratures of oversingular integrals . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , due to cfie formulation , the method does not possess spurious resonances .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the cfie  bae method has an important drawback . </S>",
    "<S> since the modelling is performed in a regular discrete space , the shape of the obstacle should be assembled of elementary `` bricks '' , so smooth scatterers ( like spheres , cylinders , etc ) are approximated with a poor accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> this loss of accuracy becomes the bottleneck of the method . here </S>",
    "<S> this disadvantage is overcome . </S>",
    "<S> the cfie  bae method developed for regular meshing of the outer space is coupled in a standard way with a relatively small irregular mesh enabling one to describe the shape of the obstacle accurately enough .    * </S>",
