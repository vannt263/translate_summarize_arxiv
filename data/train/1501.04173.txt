    "<S> examples include diffusive motion in amorphous semiconductors , structured disordered environments , or living biological cells @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to such complex systems , we here demonstrated how nonergodicity arises in force - free granular gases . </S>",
    "<S> this may seem surprising for such simple mechanistic systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , the physical reason for the nonergodicity is due to the strong non - stationarity brought about by the continuous decay of the gas temperature . for a constant restitution coefficient </S>",
    "<S> the msd @xmath95 grows logarithmically , while the time averaged msd @xmath96 is linear in the lag time and decays inverse proportionally with the length of the analyzed time traces ( aging ) . </S>",
    "<S> we derived the observed nonergodicity and the aging behavior of granular gases from the velocity autocorrelation functions . </S>",
    "<S> we note that aging in the homogeneous cooling state of granular gases was reported previously @xcite , however , it was not put in context with the diffusive dynamics of gas particles .    </S>",
    "<S> the decaying temperature of the dissipative force - free granular gas corresponds to an increase of the time span between successive collisions of gas particles , a feature directly built into the sbm model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we showed here , sbm and its ultraslow extension with the logarithmic growth of the msd indeed captures certain features of the observed motion and may serve as an effective single - particle model for the granular gas , which is particularly useful when more complex situations are considered , such as the presence of external force fields .    </S>",
    "<S> granular gases represent a fundamental physical system in statistical mechanics , extending the ideal gas model to include dissipation on particle collisions . </S>",
    "<S> granular gases are a reference model in granular matter physics @xcite with applications ranging from interstellar clouds or planetary rings to technologies in food and construction industries @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results shed new light on the physics of granular gases with respect to their violation of ergodicity in the boltzmann sense . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we obtained the detailed influence of ballistic correlations in the granular gas dynamics . </S>",
