    "perovskite co oxides also show very rich physics such as spin - state transition @xcite , ferromagnetism @xcite , and thermoelectricity @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetism in the perovskite co oxide la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath6 has been explained in terms of the double - exchange interaction between co@xmath7 and co@xmath8 in the intermediate spin state .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition temperature ( @xmath9 ) is 270 k at highest , which is significantly lower than @xmath9=370 k of perovskite mn oxides at an optimum composition .    in recent years ,",
    "the a - site ordered perovskite @xmath10baco@xmath11o@xmath12 ( @xmath13 rare earth element ) has been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "it shows a ferromagnetic transition around 300 k ( higher than @xmath9 of la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath6 ) with giant magnetoresistance @xcite .",
    "in addition , a transition from the ferromagnetic state to an antiferromagnetic state is seen around 255 k in the magnetization @xcite .",
    "the complicated magnetism has been explained as follows : the co@xmath7 ions in the intermediate spin ( is ) state of @xmath14 exhibit an orbital ordering at 350 k along the @xmath15 axis @xcite , which induces ferromagnetic interaction along the @xmath15 axis . on the other hand ,",
    "antiferromagnetic interaction is expected along the @xmath16 axis because of the conventional superexchange , which causes the antiferromagnetic order below 270 k. at higher temperatures , thermally excited carriers induce the double - exchange interaction to align the ferromagnetic chains , and stabilizes the ferromagnetic state from 270 to 300 k @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite and istomin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite independently reported a new a - site ordered perovskite co oxide sr@xmath17coo@xmath2 ( @xmath10 = y and lanthanide ) . according to their structure analysis , sr and @xmath10",
    "are ordered because of the different ionic radii .",
    "the @xmath10 ions prefer to occupy at every two sites in the @xmath18 plane , which doubles the lattice parameter of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 axes from the primitive perovskite cell .",
    "the ordered @xmath18 planes are stacked along the @xmath19-axis in units of four cells , and the @xmath19 axis length quadruples that of the primitive cell .",
    "this will give an ideal composition of sr@xmath20coo@xmath2 , but a particular composition near @xmath31/3 has been extensively studied so far . aside from the cation ordering , the two groups proposed different oxygen ordering structures , and the complete structure is still controversial .",
    "magnetic properties of sr@xmath0y@xmath21coo@xmath2 were measured only for @xmath22=0.1 and 0.33 @xcite , and we expected that the peculiar sr / y ordering near @xmath23 could show a novel magnetism . we have found that polycrystalline samples of sr@xmath0y@xmath1coo@xmath2 show a ferromagnetic transition at 335 k in a narrow range of @xmath24 , which is the highest transition temperature among perovskite co oxides .",
    "the magnetization of the @xmath3 0.225 sample is 0.25 @xmath5/co at 10 k , indicating a bulk ferromagnet .",
    "we suggest that this ferromagnetism is driven by the orbital ordering , just like the ferromagnetism in @xmath10baco@xmath11o@xmath12 .",
    "however , @xmath9 of the former is even higher than that of the latter , and ferromagnetic order survives down to 5 k. we will discuss a possible origin for the difference .",

    "that the resultant oxygen content of the sample represented an equilibrium value ( in air ) was confirmed by means of thermogravimetric annealing experiments .",

    "a tiny trace of a ferromagnetic transition is seen at 300 k for @xmath44 and 0.15 , and a weak and broad peak is seen near 300 k for @xmath45 and 0.4 , which is consistent with the literature @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the samples only in a narrow compositional range of @xmath24 show large magnetization .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition temperature ( @xmath9 ) is 335 k , which is , to our knowledge , the highest temperature in perovskite co oxides .",
    "the range of @xmath24 is quite singular , below which or above which the magnetization rapidly fades away .",
    "this makes a remarkable contrast with la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath6 , where @xmath9 and magnetization continuously change with the sr content .",

    "we expect no oxygen vacancies ( @xmath46 ) for this sample .",
    "thus the formal valence of co is more than 3.7 , and the magnetism seems to be dominated by the double exchange interaction between co@xmath8 and co@xmath7 .",
    "in fact , the observed ferromagnetic state is quite different from that in the oxygen - deficient samples : @xmath9 is remarkably lower , but the magnetization is larger .",

    "although this value is somewhat smaller than that of la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath6 ( typically more than 1 @xmath5/co ) , it is large enough to be taken as an indication of bulk ferromagnetism , and is almost equal to that of polycrystalline sample of gdbaco@xmath11o@xmath12 at 250 k @xcite .",

    "2(a ) is that the ( 101 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 103 ) peaks are much stronger in fig .",

    "thus we conclude that the a - site ordering drives the ferromagnetism in the co ions .",
    "this is the same situation as in the case of @xmath10baco@xmath11o@xmath12 , where the ordering of @xmath10 and ba stabilizes the co@xmath7 ordering .",

    "we further note that the peak is monotonically shifted to a higher degree with increasing @xmath22 , indicating that the lattice parameter is systematically decreased by substitution of y for sr ( see table i ) . on first glance , it looks inconsistent that the @xmath45 sample does not show the bulk ferromagnetism in spite of having the same intensity of the ( 103 ) peak as the @xmath56 sample .",
    "we think that the ferromagnetism is quite susceptible to the sr / y solid solution in the sr site : y can not help occupying the sr site for @xmath571/4 .",
    "in fact , our conjecture is verified by the fact that sr@xmath58ca@xmath59y@xmath60coo@xmath2 rapidly loses ferromagnetism with @xmath61 @xcite .",

    "the low - temperature magnetization is affected by the magnetic moment of dy@xmath7 , ho@xmath7 , and er@xmath7 .",
    "the low - temperature susceptibility of the er- and dy - substituted samples obeys the curie law below about 50 k. the effective magnetic moment is evaluated to be 6.7 @xmath63/er for the er - substituted sample , corresponding to 70 % of that expected from er@xmath7 of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the total angular momentum and @xmath67 is lande s g factor .",

    "since the orbital angular momentum is sometimes quenched in the presence of ligand field , the magnetic moments are reasonably evaluated for the above samples .",
    "on the other hand , the ho - substituted sample shows anomalous susceptibility that decreases with decreasing temperature below 50 k. it may indicate an antiferromagnetic coupling between co@xmath7 and ho@xmath7 ions , and such a 3@xmath70 - 4@xmath71 coupling is actually observed in @xmath72cu@xmath11o@xmath73 @xcite .    figure 4 shows the resistivity of sr@xmath0y@xmath1coo@xmath2 . the temperature dependence of resistivity is nonmetallic , which is again incompatible with the double - exchange mechanism . for @xmath24 samples , a resistivity jump is seen at 360 k , which is close to @xmath9 .",
    "a similar but larger jump was reported in the resistivity of gdbaco@xmath11o@xmath12 @xcite .",

    "now we discuss the origin of the room - temperature ferromagnetism in sr@xmath0y@xmath1coo@xmath2 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "as listed in table i , the oxygen content 3-@xmath31 for @xmath3 0.25 is @xmath77 2.64 , corresponding to the formal co valence of @xmath773.03 .",
    "this is in between the oxygen content of 2.69 for @xmath30.2 by james et al . @xcite and the oxygen content of 2.62 for @xmath30.3 by istomin et al .",

    "we believe that the co ions are essentially trivalent for @xmath3 0.25 .",
    "thus the ferromagnetism most likely arises from the orbital ordering of the is co@xmath7 ions , as in the case of @xmath10baco@xmath11o@xmath12 , which naturally explains the several similarities to the ferromagnetism in @xmath10baco@xmath11o@xmath12 mentioned above .",

    "the ferromagnetic order is highly robust down to 5 k in sr@xmath0y@xmath1coo@xmath2 , and is most likely the ground state of this system .",
    "according to the theory of orbital ordering @xcite , an antiferro - type orbital order favors a ferromagnetic order , and a ferro - type orbital order favors an antiferromagnetic order .",
    "suppose the present compound be an insulator consisting of is co@xmath7 .",

    "@xmath10baco@xmath11o@xmath12 is rather exceptional , in which the antiferromagnetic order is the ground state in spite of the anitiferro - type orbital ordering .",
    "thus the ferromagnetic state competes with the antiferromagnetic state in @xmath10baco@xmath11o@xmath12 , which causes large magnetoresistance .",

    "( i ) as a preliminary measurement , we measured the magnetoresistance of sr@xmath36y@xmath37coo@xmath79 at 300 k. the value is @xmath80 % at 7 t , which is very small compared with that of a typical giant magnetoresistance material .",
    "this suggests that the ground state is ferromagnetic and insulating , which is consistent with our orbital - ordering scenario .",
    "( ii ) we examined an impurity effect , and observed that the ferromagnetism is quite susceptible against impurities , where only a 1%-substitution of mn for co destroys a half of the saturation magnetization .",
    "such result can not be understood from simple dilution effects , and could be attributed to the impurity effect on the orbital ordering . in a case of charge ordering , a tiny disorder strongly suppresses the charge ordering state @xcite .",

    "the ferromagnetic transition temperature is approximately 335 k , which is the highest transition temperature among perovskite co oxides .",
    "the magnetization of the @xmath3 0.225 sample at 10 k is 0.25 @xmath5/co , which implies a bulk ferromagnet .",
