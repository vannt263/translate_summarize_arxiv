    "recently we have reported on the results of an investigation in the possible signatures of chaos in branching processes @xcite .",
    "the aim is to determine whether the nonlinear , non - abelian dynamics of the quantum yang - mills field possesses chaotic behavior .",
    "since in such a dynamical system the number of degrees of freedom increases with time evolution , when the notion of time is not even well defined in the branching process , new measures of trajectory , distance , entropy , etc .  must be introduced .",
    "we have found that the perturbative qcd branching shows signs indicative of chaos , whereas a model lacking the characteristics of qcd does not . in this paper",
    "we give the details of our study .    in the case of classical non - abelian dynamics",
    "special simplifying conditions that reduce the equations of motion to manageable size have been considered and chaotic solutions have been found @xcite .",
    "a more complete investigation of the gauge equations has to be done on the lattice , and it has been shown that the classical non - abelian gauge theory generally exhibits deterministic chaos , whose lyapunov exponents can be numerically computed [ 4 - 6 ] .",
    "the extension of the above classical problem to the quantum theory of yang - mills field is extremely difficult .",
    "the current state of knowledge about quantum chaos hovers round semi - classical problems in which classical trajectories are generalized to waves @xcite .",
    "that is totally inadequate for treating quantum fields , the proliferation of which in a collision process involves issues that are untouched in solving wave equations .",
    "the first step toward formulating a feasible program to attack the problem is to dissociate the complications of nonperturbative qcd from the quantum dynamics of non - abelian fields . in the perturbative domain where the qcd coupling is small ,",
    "the nature of nonlinear , non - abelian dynamics is fully present so that the signature of chaotic behavior in gauge theory should nevertheless show up in hard processes . that is an important step of simplification that renders the problem manageable .",
    "more specifically , one can narrow the scope and focus on branching processes with qcd splitting functions . the issue then becomes the search for measures that can reveal chaoticity in branching processes .    in such a search",
    "it is necessary to keep in mind the special features of qcd .",
    "there are many processes that involve branching in real time , such as cell division in biological systems .",
    "the emission of photons by an accelerated charge can be regarded as a branching process with sequential ordering . however , for gluons reproducing gluons in the pure gauge theory , the time variable plays no role in the description of a state with @xmath0 gluons whose momenta are precisely specified",
    ". in multiparticle production one works with momenta ( or their variants such as rapidity ) , since they are what can be measured in a collision process .",
    "then in the momentum space the concept of trajectory for a system of increasing number of gluons becomes ill defined . without trajectories the notion of distance between trajectories is untenable , and the conventional method of examining chaos in classical nonlinear problems is inapplicable .",
    "it will therefore be necessary for us to look for other quantities that can describe the difference between states , which evolve from what correspond to nearby initial conditions in the classical problem .",
    "the major difficulty with the study of chaotic behavior of nonlinear gauge dynamics is that the gauge fields are not directly measurable and that the branching processes can not be tracked experimentally . in collisions at high energies , where the question of chaos in gauge dynamics arises , only the particles in the final states can be measured .",
    "thus to verify any theoretical predictions about chaotic behavior , the loss of information at the end of the branching process must be quantified and presented in a form suitable for experimental determination .",
    "to that end we shall introduce an entropy index @xmath1 , which is measurable , and describes the degree of fluctuation of the final particles from event to event .    before going into details",
    ", it may be helpful to state the general idea underlying the work . in classical dynamics if the coordinates @xmath2 and momenta @xmath3 specify the system , then the trajectory in phase space is well defined in the familiar way . in classical field theory the fields , @xmath4 and @xmath5 say , form a field configuration defined over all space @xmath6 at any given time , and the change of the configuration as time evolves specifies a trajectory in a generalized sense . for quantized fields one works in the fock space so that the number of quanta becomes a variable that specifies an important aspect of the state of the system .",
    "the distance between two trajectories in that case must therefore involve , among other quantities , the difference between the numbers of quanta in the system .",
    "thus in particle production at high energy where the multiplicity @xmath0 of produced particles is an essential observable , the fluctuation of @xmath0 from event to event must be viewed as the consequence of swings of trajectories that have almost the same initial condition . with that connection in mind",
    "it is natural to generalize the conventional treatment of nonlinear dynamics to an approach that places emphasis on tracking the multiplicity fluctuations from event to event in high energy collisions . after describing the qcd dynamics of branching and a simple @xmath7 model in sec .",
    "2 , we treat the temporal behavior of the branching processes in sec .",
    "3 . then in secs . 4 and 5",
    "we consider the spatial properties of the final state .",
    "concluding remarks are given at the end .",
    "to carry out this investigation it is necessary to use computer simulation to generate events of particle production through branching .",
    "only then is it possible to study the nature of fluctuations of the final - state particles . for the simulation we shall use algorithms based on two opposite types of dynamics .",
    "one is , of course , the qcd dynamics . for simplicity we shall focus on only the pure gauge theory without quarks . at the end of the evolution we shall identify the partons as particles to avoid the complication of hadronization , which is inessential to the question of whether the gluon branching dynamics is chaotic .",
    "the other is a cascade model , to be called the @xmath7 model , which has none of the features of the qcd ; in particular , it does not have infrared and collinear divergences .",
    "it is studied in order to provide a contrast to the gauge theory so that our measures for chaoticity can be tested on these two contrasting branching dynamics .    in both",
    "branching processes the initial parton has virtuality @xmath8 , and successive branchings continue until the virtualities of all partons are @xmath9 . in pure - gauge qcd",
    "the splitting function at each vertex of branching is ( for @xmath10 )",
    "@xmath11 \\quad , \\label{1 }         \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the momentum fraction of the daughter parton in the frame where the mother parton s momentum is 1 .",
    "in the @xmath7 model we keep only the last term of ( [ 1 ] ) @xmath13 so that it has no divergences at @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the presence of those divergences is , of course , the source of complication for qcd that must be treated carefully .",
    "we follow odorico s procedure @xcite to develop the algorithm for monte carlo simulation of parton shower in qcd . because of the soft gluon and collinear divergences many partons are emitted at small @xmath12 and small angles but are not resolvable .",
    "the probability that a parton at @xmath16 can survive without emitting a resolvable parton until @xmath17 is the sudakov form factor @xcite @xmath18 \\quad , \\label{3 }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the limits of the @xmath12 integration define what is meant by resolvable .",
    "the first step of the simulation is to set @xmath19 and calculate from @xmath20 whether a parton starting from @xmath8 evolves to @xmath21 without branching . if not",
    ", then the value of @xmath22 at which the branching occurs is determined by solving @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a random number between 0 and 1 . with that @xmath22 , the value of @xmath12",
    "is then generated in accordance to the distribution @xmath25 given in ( [ 1 ] ) keeping only what is in the range @xmath26 . with that @xmath12 ,",
    "the daughter partons are assigned the maximum virtualities @xmath27 and @xmath28 , from which further evolutions are carried out by repeating the above procedure starting with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "when the virtuality of a descendant reaches @xmath31 , then that branch of the tree terminates .",
    "we shall put @xmath32 gev , to be definite . in the simulation we shall set @xmath33 , @xmath34 so that @xmath35 where @xmath36 will be set at 250 mev .",
    "we have also tried to simulate the parton shower using the algorithm of weber @xcite and found that the result differs very little from that based on the above algorithm of odorico @xcite for the type of measures we calculate .",
    "since odorico s method is far more efficient , we have chosen to use it throughout this work .    in the @xmath7 model , because of no infrared and collinear divergences , there is no automatic @xmath22 evolution .",
    "however , in order to compare its properties with those of qcd , we introduce by hand @xmath8 dependence of the branching process by requiring that at each vertex the two daughter partons have virtualities @xmath37 and @xmath38 , when the mother virtuality is @xmath22 , and @xmath12 is generated by using ( [ 2 ] ) for @xmath39 . as with qcd , we require branching to continue successively until the virtualities of all partons become @xmath40 . since @xmath22 is not degraded along a parton line , there are far more particles produced in the @xmath7 model than in qcd for the same @xmath8 , but that is immaterial , since our measure of chaoticity will not depend on @xmath41 . clearly , the dynamics of branching in the @xmath7 model is very different from qcd .",
    "we use it to exemplify the abelian dynamics that has no infrared and collinear divergences .",
    "each branching process can be represented by a tree diagram , since recombination of partons is not considered .",
    "the vertices of the tree could be ordered vertically in accordance to the values of @xmath22 of the mother partons .",
    "then there are many diagrams with the same topology that can describe different evolution processes leading to the same number of particles at the end , but belonging to different final states .",
    "if we defer the considerations of the momenta of the final particles until the next section , we can simplify the problem by focusing on only the topology of the tree diagram . in that way we study the fluctuation of the particle multiplicity at the expense of ignoring their momenta .",
    "what is gained is the possibility of defining a trajectory in the multiplicity space for a branching process .    in emphasizing the topology of a diagram",
    "let us draw all diagrams in such a way that all partons of the same generation are placed at the same level regardless of their @xmath22 .",
    "an example is shown in fig .  1 . where the partons are horizontally has no significance in that diagram .",
    "vertically , the branching points of the same generation are placed at the same level .",
    "all partons that reach the final state ( represented by the dashed line ) have @xmath31 .",
    "no information concerning @xmath42 is carried by the vertical position of the lines in the diagram .",
    "let @xmath43 denote the generation , staring with @xmath44 for the initial parton at @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the number of branching points at the @xmath46th generation . in fig .",
    "1 we have @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "we can define a vector @xmath49 with as many components as there are nonvanishing @xmath45 .",
    "thus for the diagram in fig .  1 we have @xmath50 .",
    "if this description were to be applied to an electron radiating photons , then a bremsstrahlung diagram would have @xmath51 . on the other hand , for cell reproduction where every cell subdivides into two , then @xmath52 .",
    "the description can be further simplified , if we define @xmath53 and the corresponding vector @xmath54 .",
    "since the minimum @xmath55 is 0 and the maximum @xmath56 is @xmath43 , the two extreme vectors are @xmath57 which is like bremsstrahlung , and @xmath58 which is like cell - reproduction .",
    "they are shown in fig .  2 by the thick lines , where @xmath55 is plotted against @xmath43 .",
    "all possible tree diagrams of branching processes are represented by a line in between the two boundary ( thick ) lines , as illustrated by the thin line in fig .  2 .",
    "such a line specifies a trajectory .    for finite @xmath8 the branching can not go without end , so there is always a maximum @xmath43 , which we denote by @xmath59 .",
    "the value of @xmath59 varies from event to event , even if @xmath8 is fixed for all events .",
    "two paths with the same @xmath59 may differ for @xmath60 , and the total numbers of partons produced would be different . in general , for any two trajectories",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 one can define @xmath63 at every @xmath43 where @xmath55 and @xmath64 exist simultaneously .",
    "obviously , @xmath65 can be regarded as the distance between the two trajectories .",
    "since two trajectories in @xmath6 space can cross , @xmath65 may vanish at nonzero @xmath43 . since @xmath43 is an integer",
    ", @xmath55 has discrete values .",
    "thus the trajectories can not be dense in the continuum space of @xmath43 and @xmath55 , but for the discrete support of the trajectories we may regard the collection of all possible trajectories as being dense in the sense that a trajectory can pass through any allowed value of @xmath66 .    to relate the description even more closely to the classical treatment of chaos",
    ", we now address the question of sensitivity to initial condition . in classical nonlinear dynamics",
    "one can specify the point in phase space where a trajectory begins and vary that point @xmath0 in as small a neighborhood @xmath67 as one chooses . in",
    "non - abelian gauge dynamics or in the @xmath7 model , the initial condition is that the initial parton has virtuality @xmath68 .",
    "being quantum mechanical , it is not necessary to vary @xmath22 in a small neighborhood of @xmath8 .",
    "quantum fluctuation is sufficient to guarantee that the final state of the branching process will vary from event to event , even if all events start out at precisely the same @xmath8 .",
    "thus the relationship to the classical consideration of initial condition is as follows .",
    "consider @xmath69 random points in the neighborhood @xmath67 of the initial point in phase space of a classical trajectory .",
    "any such point can be mapped to the beginning of a particular branching process .",
    "a set of @xmath69 events in the monte carlo simulation all starting out at the same @xmath8 then correspond to @xmath69 trajectories beginning in the neighborhood @xmath67 in the classical case . with this correspondence between the two problems",
    "it is then sensible to suggest that instead of studying the distance between two neighboring trajectories , one should consider all @xmath69 events in the monte carlo simulation and examine the mean deviation from the average of the parton multiplicities .",
    "indeed , the study of fluctuations of observable quantities will be the main theme of our approach to analyzing chaotic behavior of branching processes .    in fig .",
    "3 we show schematically several possible trajectories of the branching processes , all started out at the same @xmath8 .",
    "not only can trajectories that have the same @xmath59 be different , those with different @xmath59 are even more dissimilar . for the purpose of studying `` temporal '' behavior , which corresponds to the dependence on the generation @xmath43 in the branching process , only trajectories with the same @xmath59 can be compared .",
    "thus it is necessary to know the distribution @xmath70 of @xmath59 for all events .",
    "4 shows the result of @xmath71 simulations for each of the two type of branching processes discussed in the previous section .",
    "the initial virtualities are such that @xmath72 for qcd and 15 for the @xmath7 model .",
    "these values are chosen so that the average multiplicities are comparable , as we shall show below .",
    "both @xmath70 are gaussian - like distributions , with the width being larger for qcd .",
    "this is the first indication of more fluctuation for qcd as compared to the @xmath7 model . in choosing a narrow band of @xmath59 for further investigation",
    ", we select the shaded regions in fig.4 that are situated at the maximum of @xmath70 .    as mentioned before",
    ", time is not a well - defined variable in the branching process .",
    "it is deemphasized when we focus on the topololgy of the tree diagrams .",
    "the generation label @xmath43 carries only a rough notion of time , since it is well known , as in family genealogy , that a son can be younger than a grandson .",
    "however , there is one quantity that increases monotonically with @xmath43 ; it is the parton multiplicity @xmath73 @xmath74 even though @xmath55 may rise and fall with @xmath43 .",
    "define the average parton multiplicity @xmath75 at generation @xmath43 by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the value of @xmath73 at @xmath43 for the _ e_th event and the sum is over all @xmath78 events having the same @xmath59 chosen .",
    "this quantity @xmath79 may be taken to play the role of time in the branching process , although no linear dependence is implied . in fig .",
    "5 we show the simulated results on @xmath75 as functions of @xmath43 for various values of @xmath41 . in both types of branching processes @xmath79 increases monotonically with @xmath43 , the rate being fastest at midrange of @xmath43 .",
    "the values of @xmath41 are chosen such that @xmath79 are roughly in the same range for the two types .",
    "for the measure that describes the fluctuation of the trajectories , and therefore of the multiplicities , we use the normalized variance @xmath80 which clearly gives a measure of the average `` distance '' between trajectories .",
    "it is always positive , as a distance function should be . in fig .",
    "6 is shown the results of simulation for the two cases .",
    "the sustained increase in the lower half of @xmath43 range for qcd is a distinctive feature that is not shared by the @xmath7 model .",
    "a more transparent way of presenting this result is to plot @xmath81 vs @xmath82 , as shown in fig .",
    "it corresponds to plotting the distance @xmath83 against @xmath84 in the classical problem , except that here @xmath79 is not exactly @xmath84 , but some representation of it .",
    "now , the behavior for qcd appears universal , i.e. , independent of @xmath41 over a wide range . in the log - log plot",
    "the behavior is approximately linear .",
    "the same is not true for the @xmath7 model : @xmath81 increases initially , then drops precipitously , as @xmath85 is increased .",
    "furthermore , the maximum decreases with increasing @xmath41 . thus the uncertainty in the parton multiplicity increases with @xmath86 in the former case , but saturates and then decreases in the latter case .",
    "if that uncertainty can be regarded as a measure of chaos , then the qcd dynamics is chaotic , while the @xmath7 model is not .",
    "we can express the dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath86 in the qcd case in the form of a power law @xmath87 then from fig .",
    "7 we find @xmath88 to be @xmath89 . writing ( [ 10 ] ) in the form of an exponential @xmath90 we may compare it to the definition of lyapunov exponent @xmath91 in @xmath92 .",
    "if ln@xmath85 can be interpreted to correspond to @xmath84 , then @xmath88 may be said to play the role of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "however , nothing firm can be proven about these correspondences , so the above remarks should only be taken as a possible orientation in interpreting the implication of the result obtained .    from what has so far been done , it is not possible for us to find a criterion on the magnitude of @xmath88 to signify robust chaoticity",
    ". furthermore , @xmath82 and @xmath81 are aspects of the parton state at generation @xmath43 before the completion of the branching processes .",
    "thus they are not experimentally measurable . for particle production in high energy collisions ,",
    "the temporal behavior of branching is primarily a theoretical problem . for experimental verification of any theoretical prediction , it is necessary to focus on the final state , which is the subject of the next two sections .",
    "in the final state the complete information about the partons , now identified as observable particles , is registered by their momenta .",
    "if the branching trajectories never change , then there is certainty in where to find those particles in the momentum space , and the entropy ( to be defined below ) is zero , corresponding to no loss of information .",
    "however , quantum fluctuation alone is sufficient to cause fluctuation in the final - state momenta , so entropy is not expected to vanish . in multifractal analysis of complex patterns ,",
    "the information dimension is a compact way of summarizing the dependence of the entropy on resolution scale @xcite . since multifractal analysis of the multiplicity fluctuation in high - energy collisions has been proposed @xcite and carried out @xcite , it is natural to examine the information dimension for the branching processes considered here    if @xmath93 denotes the fraction of particles in an event that fall into the @xmath94th bin of size @xmath95 , then in the limit of many such bins in the system under study , the entropy is defined by @xcite @xmath96 and the information dimension @xmath97 is @xcite @xmath98 the study of self - similar behavior of particle production has been greatly facilitated by the use of normalized factorial momenta @xmath99 , suggested by biaas and peschanski @xcite , who first showed that the statistical fluctuations are filtered out by those moments .",
    "however , since @xmath99 is defined for integer @xmath100 , it can not be used to determine the information dimension , which involves the derivative of @xmath99 with repect to @xmath101 at @xmath102 .",
    "for that reason the @xmath103 moments for all real @xmath101 , positive and negative , were introduced for analyzing the multifractal structure of particle production data @xcite .",
    "their drawback is that the statistical fluctuations must be taken out of @xmath103 explicitly by hand .",
    "more recently , a method for continuing @xmath99 to noninteger @xmath101 , while maintaining its virtue of not being contaminated by statistical fluctuations , has been developed @xcite .",
    "we shall therefore make use of it to determine @xmath97 .    before describing the details of the calculations ,",
    "let us first make clear the space in which the self - similar behavior is examined .",
    "with @xmath104 denoting the momentum fraction of an _",
    "i_th generation daughter parton at a branching vertex , where the mother parton has momentum 1 , the momentum fraction of a final particle is then @xmath105 where the product is taken over all generations of a particular path in the branching tree , leading from the initial parton to the final particle under consideration .",
    "since all @xmath104 are known in a simulated event , the values of @xmath6 for all particles can be calculated ; they are all crowded in the @xmath106 region , since their sum is 1 .",
    "this is especially true for qcd branching because of the soft gluon divergence in ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "if we expand the @xmath106 region by using the variable @xmath107 , we get a broad gaussian - like distribution , as shown is fig .   8 , with the peak at @xmath108 corresponding to @xmath109 .",
    "the situation is not as bad for the @xmath7 model , but still most particles are found in the small @xmath6 region , as shown in fig .",
    "this highly uneven distribution of @xmath6 is inappropriate for data analysis that involves the partition of the space into small bins .",
    "one can define another variable @xmath110 , in terms of which the distribution is much smoother @xcite .",
    "let the inclusive distribution in @xmath6 , averaged over many events , be @xmath111 .",
    "then the cumulative variable @xmath110 is defined by @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are two extreme points in the distribution @xmath111 , between which @xmath110 varies from 0 to 1 . in terms of @xmath110",
    "the inclusive distribution @xmath115 is constant . for qcd",
    "branching we shall take @xmath116 to be the @xmath117 distribution as in fig .   8 ; for the @xmath7 model @xmath116 will be just the @xmath6 distribution as in fig .   9 .",
    "an illustration of the @xmath115 distribution for qcd is shown is fig .",
    "10 after simulating @xmath118 events at @xmath72 .",
    "note the expanded scale along the vertical axis .",
    "now , in @xmath110 space we divide the interval @xmath119 into @xmath120 bins of width @xmath121 .",
    "let @xmath122 be the number of final particles in the @xmath94th bin in any given event .",
    "the factorial moment of @xmath101th order is @xmath123 the normalized factorial moment after averaging over all events is @xmath124 since @xmath125 is the average of @xmath126 over all bins and over all events , we may write it as @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the multiplicity distribution in a bin . in general , @xmath128 may be expressed as a convolution of the statistical @xmath129 and the dynamical @xmath130 contributions to the multiplicity fluctuations : @xmath131 where a poissonian distribution has been used for @xmath132 . putting ( [ 19 ] ) into ( [ 18 ] ) yields @xmath133 this is the standard moment of the dynamical distribution that has no statistical contamination @xcite . if @xmath134 , so that @xmath128 is poissonian , then @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "any deviation of @xmath99 from 1 is an indication of the presence of dynamical fluctuation .",
    "phenomenologically , one does not have access to @xmath137 . using @xmath128 as input from experiment or from simulation",
    ", one can determine @xmath138 , but only for integer @xmath101 .",
    "one may replace the factorials in ( [ 18 ] ) by gamma functions in order to continue ( [ 18 ] ) to noninteger @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "but that procedure does not result in @xmath136 for poisson distribution for all @xmath101 . in ref .",
    "@xcite a continuation procedure is developed that guarantees @xmath136 for all @xmath101 when @xmath137 is trivial .",
    "that method will not be described here , but will be used to determine @xmath99 for our branching processes .    for notational brevity",
    "let us write the rhs of ( [ 20 ] ) as @xmath139 .",
    "then we have @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the fraction of event multiplicity in a bin , as in ( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "thus from ( [ 12 ] ) we get @xmath142 if @xmath99 has a power - law behavior near @xmath143 , i.e. , @xmath144 it then follows from ( [ 13 ] ) that in the large @xmath120 limit @xmath145 note that this relationship is derived under the assumption that ( [ 22 ] ) is meaningful , which demands that @xmath99 is well defined in a range of @xmath101 around @xmath102 and that @xmath146 contains only dynamical information without spurious contribution arising from improper continuation procedure @xcite .",
    "if dynamically the bin multiplicity is evenly distributed among all @xmath120 bins so that @xmath147 , then @xmath136 for all @xmath101 ( including non - integer @xmath101 ) and ( [ 22 ] ) gives @xmath148 . on the other hand ,",
    "if dynamically only a fraction @xmath149 of the @xmath120 bins are populated , the rest empty , i.e. @xmath150 then @xmath151 and @xmath152 for all @xmath101 .",
    "hence , ( [ 22 ] ) yields @xmath153 .",
    "if , in particular , only one bin is non - empty , i.e. , @xmath154 , then @xmath155 . thus ( [ 25 ] ) offers a simple way of seeing how the entropy increases from @xmath156 to @xmath157 , as the fraction of non - empty bins increases from @xmath158 to @xmath15 .",
    "if there is only one non - empty bin , the dynamics is like one with a classical trajectory that has no dispersion in where the particles are to be found in the momentum space . without loss of information",
    "the entropy is zero . if there is maximum dispersion corresponding to all bins being equally likely to be populated , then the entropy is maximum .",
    "we now apply this method of analysis to our simulated branching processes .",
    "first , we show in fig .",
    "11 the multiplicity distributions in qcd for various bin sizes @xmath159 after @xmath71 events .",
    "it should be understood that fig.10 shows the inclusive @xmath110 distribution after summing over all events .",
    "but event by event the fluctuation in @xmath110 space is much greater . upon dividing the interval @xmath119 into @xmath120 bins and counting the multiplicity in each bin ,",
    "one then obtains @xmath160 after averaging over all the events .",
    "the degree of fluctuation around the decreasing @xmath161 , relative to that average , as @xmath120 is increased , is what is measured by the normalized factorial moments @xmath99 defined by ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "this is unlike our theoretical calculation based on ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 25 ] ) because @xmath137 is not known explicitly in the simulation .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "12 for both qcd and @xmath162 model . since @xmath163 by definition",
    ", we see that @xmath99 increases with @xmath101 in qcd , but decreases with increasing @xmath101 in the @xmath7 model .",
    "it means that the distributions @xmath160 for qcd are wider than poisson , but for the @xmath7 model they are sub - poissonian . fig .",
    "12 also shows that there is very little @xmath120 dependence in either case . for non - integer @xmath101",
    "values a substantial amount of work is needed to continue @xmath99 according to the method of @xcite . the result is shown in fig .   13 .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath164 all @xmath99 are greater in qcd than in the @xmath7 model .",
    "it corresponds to more fluctuations in qcd than in the @xmath7 model , a result that is consistent with the finding of the previous section .",
    "it is also evident from fig .",
    "13 that @xmath165 is essentially independent of @xmath120 in both cases .",
    "whereas @xmath132 is still dependent on @xmath120 according to ( [ 22 ] ) , the @xmath120 independence of @xmath166 requires , on account of ( [ 23 ] ) , that @xmath167 .",
    "this together with ( [ 24 ] ) entails @xmath168 in both cases .",
    "thus there is no interesting multifractal property .",
    "this particular approach to finding a useful signature of chaotic behavior ends in failure .",
    "the smoothing of the phase space by use of the @xmath110 variable in place of the momentum fraction variable @xmath6 has undoubtedly contributed to eliminating some aspect of the fractal structure .",
    "but what has not been removed is the more interesting consequences of the dynamics . the triviality of @xmath97 states only that there is no nontrivial self - similarity in the fluctuations measured . the latter are quantified by @xmath99 , which involves both the bin and event averages of the factorial product in ( [ 16 ] )",
    "the result suggests that some of the fluctuations have been lost by the averaging process . in the next section",
    "we develop a scheme to recapture that which has been lost .",
    "we know that event by event there are large fluctuations in where the produced particles are in the @xmath110 space .",
    "what we want to do now is to find a way to register the fluctuation ( from event to event ) of the fluctuation ( in the @xmath110 distribution ) .",
    "let @xmath169 denote the normalized factorial moment of the _ e_th event : @xmath170 where @xmath171 is as defined in ( [ 16 ] ) for the _ e_th event .",
    "clearly , @xmath169 changes with @xmath172 for fixed @xmath101 and @xmath120 . in fig .",
    "14 we show the distribution @xmath173 after @xmath71 simulated events of qcd branching , the label @xmath172 being omitted . for clarity , only @xmath174 and @xmath175 are exhibited for a wide range of @xmath120 values . at small @xmath120",
    "the distribution has a peak at @xmath176 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath177 and event multiplicity is large , then @xmath99 should be very nearly 1 for all events . at large @xmath120 a peak at @xmath178 is developed , especially at high @xmath101 , because the bin multiplicity for small @xmath95 is small and may in many events be less than @xmath101 for all bins , in which cases @xmath179 .",
    "this large fluctuation in @xmath173 is what we want to capture , and would be lost if @xmath99 is averaged over all events .",
    "clearly we should take the moments of @xmath99 before performing the average .",
    "we may think of @xmath169 as the horizontal moments in the @xmath110 space , and then define the vertical moments in the event space as follows : @xmath180 where @xmath78 is the total number of events and @xmath141 is a positive real number not restricted to integers .",
    "the normalized moments of moments are @xmath181 if @xmath182 has a power - law behavior in @xmath120 , i.e. , @xmath183 then we can define @xmath184 which will be referred to as the entropy index .    to see the connection between @xmath185 and entropy ,",
    "let us define @xmath186 and a ( new ) entropy in the event space @xmath187 furthermore , define the moments @xmath188 which are related to @xmath189 by @xmath190 on the other hand , @xmath191 can be related to @xmath192 by @xmath193 so we have @xmath194 in then follows from ( [ 30 ] ) and ( [ 31 ] ) that @xmath195 apart from a possible additive term that is independent of @xmath78 and @xmath120 .",
    "this entropy , as defined in ( [ 33 ] ) , is clearly different from the entropy @xmath132 defined in ( [ 12 ] ) . to emphasize that @xmath189 is defined in the event space",
    ", we may call it eventropy .",
    "we can think of the event space as a one dimensional space with @xmath78 sites .",
    "at each site we can register a number @xmath196 . if @xmath196 is the same at each site , then @xmath197 , and @xmath198 .",
    "we should think of this as being highly disordered in the event space , since @xmath196 is spread out uniformly over all space .",
    "the larger the number of events , the larger is the eventropy .",
    "this is very similar to the situation where @xmath199 , when the bin multiplicity is uniformly distributed in the @xmath110 space that has @xmath120 bins .",
    "a branching dynamic that results in the same @xmath196 for every event does not fluctuate in the branching processes .",
    "it corresponds to nearby trajectories staying nearby throughout . in short ,",
    "the dynamics is not chaotic . for @xmath189 to be @xmath200 , we see from ( [ 38 ] ) that @xmath1 must vanish .",
    "thus small @xmath1 corresponds to large eventropy , which in turn implies no chaotic behavior .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the other extreme where all @xmath196 are zero except one event @xmath201 , then @xmath202 and @xmath203 . this is highly ordered in the event space , but the fluctuation of @xmath196 from zero to a nonzero value is large . generally speaking ,",
    "if the distribution @xmath173 is broad , the fluctuation is large , initially nearby trajectories become widely separated in the final states of different events , and the dynamics is chaotic . in order for the eventropy to be small",
    ", @xmath1 must be large .",
    "thus large entropy index implies chaotic behavior .    in fig .",
    "15 the results of our simulation are shown for @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 . from the log - log plots",
    "one can identify approximate scaling behavior .",
    "we used the region @xmath209 to determine the value of @xmath210 , for which @xmath192 for an incremental region of @xmath141 around @xmath211 has to be examined .",
    "we obtain @xmath212 this result is plotted in fig .",
    "clearly , @xmath213 is much larger than @xmath214 .",
    "it is suggestive that the qcd dynamics is chaotic , while the @xmath7 model is not .",
    "however , at this point we have no quantitative criterion on how large @xmath1 must be in order to be chaotic . in classical nonlinear problems",
    "there is also no criterion on how long the time lapse must be in order for the distance between nearby trajectories to become sufficiently far apart to qualify for divergent behavior .",
    "nevertheless , the positivity of the lyapunov exponent is a simple condition , the counterpart of which for the entropy index is lacking .",
    "we have explored various ways of measuring chaoticity of branching processes . because the problem is far more complicated than a classical nonlinear problem",
    ", the search has not been a straightforward extension of the conventional ideas .",
    "our approach has been based on a simple premise : if a branching process is chaotic , then it should be hard to predict what the likely outcome of an event would be , given the knowledge of the result of a previous event .",
    "it means that there are large fluctuations from event to event .",
    "to be more concrete , we have focused first on the temporal development of branching . the variance @xmath81 of the multiplicities at a particular generation @xmath43 can be regarded as a measure of the mean distance between `` trajectories '' .",
    "we have found that @xmath81 increases with @xmath79 in a power - law fashion for qcd branching , but not for the @xmath7 model , an example of abelian branching dynamics .",
    "that is the first indication that the qcd dynamics has the characteristics of being chaotic .",
    "we have not investigated the behavior of the higher moments , @xmath81 being related to only the second moment .",
    "it is probably safe to predict that the higher moments would increase even more rapidly with @xmath79 .    for fluctuations in the final state where experimental observations are feasible",
    ", we have considered @xmath99 , @xmath97 , @xmath192 , and @xmath185 as possible measures of chaoticity .",
    "it turns out that the information dimension is not effective , but the entropy index can be .",
    "what emerges is a realization that one should study the phase space and the event space simultaneously .",
    "more specifically , consider a two - dimensional lattice , where the horizontal axis has @xmath120 sites , corresponding to the @xmath120 bins in the @xmath110 space , and where the vertical axis has @xmath78 sites , corresponding to the @xmath78 events in the event space .",
    "for every event there is a horizontal array of @xmath120 numbers , indicating the particle multiplicities in the @xmath120 bins .",
    "the moments of moments @xmath192 summarize the distribution on this whole lattice without significant loss of information .",
    "the entropy index @xmath185 extracts from this lattice of numbers a simple numerical quantity that can characterize the degree of fluctuations on the lattice .",
    "the larger @xmath185 is , the more chaotic the system is .",
    "we do not have at this point a criterion on the threshold value of @xmath185 , above which chaotic behavior will definitely occur . further investigation on this aspect of the problem is undoubtedly warranted .",
    "each of the features studied reveals some aspect of the chaotic behavior of qcd dynamics .",
    "taken together collectively , they present a strong contrast from the results of the @xmath7 model . one may wonder what the mechanisms are in the branching processes that can lead to such diverse outcomes .",
    "our view is that in qcd branching there is a tension between two opposing forces that is absent in the @xmath7 model .",
    "the collinear divergence implies a strong preference for small angle emission of partons in the branching process .",
    "but if the emission angle is too small to be resolved , there is no branching . since evolution without branching",
    "is suppressed by the sudakov form factor , there is a competition between evolution by emitting a resolvable gluon and a preference for emitting a collinear unresolvable gluon .",
    "it is this tension that leads to large fluctuations in the number of branching points and hence to chaotic behavior .",
    "the @xmath7 model has no collinear divergence and no @xmath22 evolution , so there is no tension to cause large fluctuations .",
    "what we learn here may lay the foundation for finding ways to treat nonperturbative processes , for which chaotic behavior may play a crucial role in the evolution of a large system of quarks and gluons , such as those produced in a heavy - ion collision at high energy .",
