    "in the context of the minimal standard model ( msm ) , any electroweak ( ew ) process can be computed at tree level from @xmath3 ( the fine structure constant measured at values of @xmath4 close to zero ) ,  ( the w - boson mass ) ,  ( the z - boson mass ) , and  ( the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa flavour - mixing matrix elements ) .    when higher order corrections are included , any observable can be predicted in the `` on - shell '' renormalization scheme as a function of :    o_i & = & f_i ( , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , v_jk )    and contrary to what happens with `` exact gauge symmetry theories '' , like qed or qcd , the effects of heavy particles do not decouple .",
    "therefore , the msm predictions depend on the top mass ( @xmath5 ) and to less extend to the higgs mass ( log(@xmath6 ) ) , or to any kind of `` heavy new physics '' .",
    "the subject of this letter is to show how the high precision achieved in the ew measurements from 0  physics allows to test the msm beyond the tree level predictions and , therefore , how this measurements are able to indirectly determine the value of  and , to constrain the unknown value of , and at the same time to test the consistency between measurements and theory . at present",
    "the uncertainties in the theoretical predictions are dominated by the precision on the input parameters .",
    "the w mass is one of the input parameters in the `` on - shell '' renormalization scheme .",
    "it is known with a precision of about 0.07% , although the usual procedure is to take  ( the fermi constant measured in the muon decay ) to predict  as a function of the rest of the input parameters and use this more precise value .",
    "therefore , the input parameters are chosen to be :    input  parameter & value & relative  uncertainty + ^-1(^2 _ ) = & 128.896 ( 90 ) & 0.07 % + _ ( ^2 _ ) = & 0.119 ( 2 ) & 1.7 % + g _ = & 1.16639 ( 2 ) 10 ^ -5   & 0.0017 % + _ = & 91.1867 ( 21 )   & 0.0023 % + _ = & 173.8 ( 50 )   & 2.9 % + _ > & 89.8  @95%  c.l .",
    "&    notice that the less well known parameters are ,  and , of course , the unknown value of .",
    "the next less well known parameter is @xmath7 , even though its value at @xmath8 is known with an amazing relative precision of @xmath9 , ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the reason for this loss of precision when one computes the running of @xmath3 ,    ^-1(^2 _ ) & = &    is the large contribution from the light fermion loops to the photon vacuum polarisation , @xmath11 .",
    "the contribution from leptons and top quark loops is well calculated but for the light quarks non - perturbative qcd corrections are large at low energy scales . the method so far has been to use the measurement of the hadronic cross section through one - photon exchange , normalised to the point - like muon cross - section , r(s ) , and evaluate the dispersion integral :    ( ^ _ ) & = & ( ds )    giving  @xcite @xmath12 , the error being dominated by the experimental uncertainty in the cross section measurements .",
    "recently , several new _",
    "`` theory driven '' _",
    "calculations  @xcite  @xcite have reduced this error by a factor of about 4.5 , by extending the regime of applicability of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "this needs to be confirmed using precision measurements of the hadronic cross section at @xmath13  1  to  7  gev .",
    "the very preliminary first results from bess ii  @xcite seem to validate this procedure , being in agreement with the predictions from pqcd .",
    "from the point of view of radiative corrections we can divide the 0  measurements into three different groups : the 0  total and partial widths , the partial width into b - quarks ( @xmath14 ) , and the 0  asymmetries ( ) . for instance , the leptonic width ( ) is mostly sensitive to isospin - breaking loop corrections ( @xmath15 ) , the asymmetries are specially sensitive to radiative corrections to the 0  self - energy , and  is mostly sensitive to vertex corrections in the decay @xmath16 .",
    "one more parameter , @xmath17 , is necessary to describe the radiative corrections to the relation between  and .",
    "the sensitivity of these three 0  observables and  to the input parameters is shown in table  [ tab : sensitiv ] .",
    "the most sensitive observable to the unknown value of  are the 0  asymmetries parametrised via .",
    "however also the sensitivity of the rest of the observables is very relevant compared to the achieved experimental precision .    .",
    "relative error in units of per - mil on the msm predictions induced by the uncertainties on the input parameters .",
    "the second column shows the present experimental errors.[tab : sensitiv ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      although the most precise determination of the higgs mass is still coming from the 0  asymmetries , it is clear from table  [ tab : consistency ] that any future improvement will be limited by the uncertainty in @xmath18 . if @xmath19 , then the error on @xmath20 is reduced to about 0.23 ( @xmath21 \\oplus [ \\delta\\mathrm{m}_{\\mathrm{t}}]$ ] ) , coming only from the 0  asymmetries measurements .    the accuracy of the w - boson mass is going to improve by a significant factor in the near future .",
    "however , even if the w mass is measured with a precision of 30  mev , the error on @xmath20 is going to be dominated by @xmath22 and will not be better than 0.23 obtained with the 0  asymmetries only , both determinations being highly correlated by the uncertainty on the top mass .    therefore , the error on @xmath20  is not going to improve significantly until a precise measurement of the top mass ( 2  gev ) becomes available .",
    "in such a case , one can easily obtain a precision in @xmath20 close to 0.15 .",
    "this is what is shown in figure  [ fig : chi2mh ] .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : chi2mh ] is the expected direct search limit from lep2 .",
    "if the tendency to prefer a very low value of  continues with the new or updated measurements , and the accuracy on the top mass and w - boson mass are improved significantly , consistent with the indirect determinations , we may be able to constrain severely the value of .",
    "the measurements performed at lep and slc have substantially improved the precision of the tests of the msm , at the level of ( 0.1% ) .",
    "the effects of pure weak corrections are visible with a significance larger than three standard deviations from 0  observables and about seven standard deviations from the w - boson mass .",
    "the top mass predicted by the msm fits , ( = @xmath23  gev ) is compatible ( about @xmath24 ) with the direct measurement ( = @xmath25  gev ) and of similar precision .",
    "the w - boson mass predicted by the msm fits , ( @xmath26 ) is in very good agreement with the direct measurement ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the mass of the higgs boson is predicted to be low ,    ( _ / ) = & 1.88^+0.33_-0.41 & ( _ = 76^+85_-47  ) + _ & < & 262  @ 95 %     this uncertainty is reduced to @xmath28 when the uncertainty from @xmath29 is negligible , and will be further reduced to @xmath30 when  is known with a 2  gev precision and  is known with a 30  mev precision .",
