    "the alice  @xcite experiment at the large hadron collider  @xcite was designed to study strongly interacting matter in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , at energy densities up to two orders of magnitude larger than that of ordinary nuclear matter . under these conditions ,",
    "finite temperature qcd calculations on the lattice  @xcite predict a transition to a deconfined state of matter known as quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "heavy flavour particle production is modified by the presence of the medium .",
    "in particular , quarkonium production suppression by colour screening was one of the first proposed signatures for qgp formation  @xcite ; charmonium regeneration due to the recombination of initially uncorrelated @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks may occur at lhc energies  @xcite . a detailed description of the physics motivations for charmonium measurements in heavy - ion collisions can be found in  @xcite .",
    "quarkonium production measurement in collisions is crucial as a reference for pb - pb data ; moreover , it is expected to provide insights on the j/@xmath2 production mechanism .",
    "a complete description of the alice experiment can be found in  @xcite .    the j/@xmath2 measurement at mid - rapidity is performed by detecting its dielectron decays with the alice central detectors ( -0.9<@xmath5<0.9 ) .",
    "this analysis is based on the inner tracking system ( its ) for vertexing and tracking and the time projection chamber@xcite ( tpc ) for tracking and particle identification .",
    "other detectors such as the transition radiation detector , the time of flight and the electromagnetic calorimeter , not used in this analysis , will greatly improve the alice electron identification capabilities in the future .    at forward rapidity",
    ", j/@xmath2 production is measured in the dimuon channel with a dedicated muon spectrometer ( -4<@xmath5<-2.5 ) .",
    "the muon spectrometer is equipped with a dipole magnet , a set of absorbers , five tracking stations and a dedicated trigger system .",
    "the mid - rapidity analysis is based on minimum - bias events , triggered by the v0 scintillators and the two innermost layers of the its ( silicon pixel detector , spd ) .",
    "the forward rapidity analysis is based on muon triggered events .",
    "luminosity normalisation is performed via a reference cross section , measured in van der meer scans with the v0 detector  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are for inclusive j/@xmath2 production : promptly produced j/@xmath2s are not separated from those originating from b meson decays .",
    "the dependence of acceptance on the unknown j/@xmath2 polarisation is a major source of systematic uncertainty ( up to  ) for both the dielectron and the dimuon channel . here , we assume no polarisation and quote separately the polarisation - related uncertainty .",
    "the alice results on j/@xmath2 at mid - rapidity are based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.9  nb@xmath8 .",
    "particle identification is performed via energy loss in the tpc ; tracking uses both its and tpc . a hit in one of the two spd layers ( 3.9 and 7.6  cm in radius ) is required , in order to minimise the effect of @xmath9 conversions .",
    "cuts on the electron @xmath10 ( > 1  gev / c ) and on the track quality ( @xmath11 , number of tpc clusters ) are applied .",
    "the j/@xmath2 yield is extracted by subtracting from the di - electron invariant mass spectrum the corresponding like - sign background distribution ( fig .",
