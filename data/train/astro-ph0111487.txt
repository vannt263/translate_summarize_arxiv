    "the sixty fourth object in weymann et al .  sample , pg  2302 + 029 , is a broad absorption line quasar ( jannuzi et al .",

    "we selected the sample of the absorption lines for further analysis using the following criteria :    \\1 .",
    "the detection significance for the line has to be greater than 5@xmath8 .",
    "a line can not be identified as a heavy element absorption feature .",

    "we can not rule out the possibility that some of the lines in our sample are in fact unidentified metal system lines .",
    "however , we found that the exclusion from the analysis of all lines with @xmath11     which , in view of fig .",
    "[ fig : eqwhist ] , are the prime suspects for being unrecognized metal lines  produced negligible differences in the number density evolution results .",
    "figure  [ fig : zcoverage ] shows the comparison of redshift coverage in our sample with the weymann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) sample .",
    "the upper panel shows the combined path length available for study in both samples as a function of redshift , while the lower panel shows the number of available lines .",
    "the notable differences are that ( 1 ) our sample extends to @xmath12 , while the key project sample effectively ends at @xmath13 , ( 2 ) our sample contains considerably more lines in the @xmath14 range , and ( 3 ) our sample by definition excludes lines below  emission line , while the key project sample does not .",
    "we note that did not attempt to remove the flat field features in the fos spectra , which the key project went to great lengths to do ( schneider et al .",

    "we identify 38 of their 141 confirmed flat field features as lines with significance greater than 5@xmath8 ( paper  iii ) .",
    "however , only nine of those features lie in the  forest . simple extrapolation of those numbers to the sample analyzed here would indicate that roughly 24 lines out of our total sample of 1298 , or less than 2% , are spurious .",
    "however , even this low number is likely overestimated , since majority of redshift path in our sample that is added to the key project sample ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zcoverage ] ) is in regions covered by g130h and g270h gratings , which have less ( none in the case of g130h , actually ) identified flat field features than grating g190h ( jannuzi et al .",
    "those should have a negligible effect on our results .",
    "we parameterized the distribution of individual clouds using : @xmath16 where , @xmath17 , and  are the distribution parameters . for a non - evolving population of clouds @xmath18 , depending on the value of @xmath19 ( peterson 1978 ) .",
    "it is well - established that @xmath17 is significantly greater than 1 at @xmath20 , indicating strong evolution ( e.g.  bajtlik , duncan , & ostriker 1988 ; lu , wolfe , & turnshek 1991 ; bechtold 1994 ; kim et al.1997 ; paper  i ) .",
    "however , the hst quasar absorption line key project and other studies showed that @xmath17 is less then 1 at @xmath21 , consistent with the no evolution case ( bahcall et al .",

    "; vanden berk et al .",
    "1999 ; impey , petry , & flint 1999 ) .",
    "the proximity effect ( bajtlik , duncan & ostriker 1988 ; bechtold 1994 ; paper  ii ) at high redshift causes the derived value of @xmath17 to depend strongly on the inclusion or exclusion of lines with @xmath22 .",
    "however , the proximity effect is not expected to influence the results as significantly at low redshift for a few reasons .",
    "first , the overall number density of absorbers per unit redshift is smaller than at high redshift , and so the expected number of lines affected will also be small .",
    "second , the quasars used at low redshift are intrinsically fainter on average than the quasars observed at high @xmath2 , and thus it is expected that their influence at their environment will also be less prominent ( see paper v ) .",
    "we determined the distribution parameters both including and excluding lines with `` ejection velocity '' , velocity displacement from the emission redshift of the quasar , greater than 3000  .",
    "a detailed analysis of the proximity effect is presented in paper  v.      we estimated the parameters , @xmath17 , and  from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dndz ] ) for the whole fos sample and several subsamples .",
    "we developed and utilized a computer code , based on the algorithm from murdoch et al .",
    "( 1986 ; their equations [ a2a ] and [ a8a ] corrected ) , modified so that the integral in eq .",
    "( a2 ) of murdoch et al .",
    ", which can not be calculated analytically in the case of variable threshold , is derived numerically .",
    "the murdoch et al .",
    "method consists of solving for @xmath17 and  by finding the roots of the derivatives of the log of the likelihood function describing equation  ( [ eq : dndz ] ) with respect to @xmath17 and .",
    "uncertainties in each parameter are found from a parabolic fit to @xmath23 such that 1@xmath8 corresponds to @xmath24 .",
    "the normalization , , is calculated by dividing the total number of lines by the sum of the integral of equation  ( [ eq : dndz ] ) over the redshift paths in all quasars : @xmath25^{-1}. \\label{eq : anaughtintegral}\\ ] ] for the considered sample . for each run of our program , we tested the goodness - of - fit of the outcome using kolmogorov - smirnoff test .",
    "this treatment of the normalization differs slightly from that of the hst key project .",
    "we and the key project both solve for @xmath17 and  using all lines above some rest equivalent width that is either fixed to some constant value or varied according to the signal - to - noise ratio in each spectral region .",
    "weymann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) determine the normalization , denoted @xmath26 in their table  2 , explicitly in the maximum likelihood solution rather than by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : anaughtintegral ] ) .",
    "each @xmath26 value listed in their table is the local line density relative to the local density of lines above 0.24   , regardless of the limiting equivalent width of the sample used . in our software , this relative scaling is not done . in other words",
    ", we always normalize to the stated constant rest equivalent width limit and do not quote a value of  for the case of a variable rest equivalent width limit .",
    "table  [ tab : dndz - hst ] presents a summary of our estimates of the parameters from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dndz ] ) in several subsamples of the data set .",
    "the main result , seen clearly in table  [ tab : dndz - hst ] , is that in all cases the value of the evolution index , @xmath17 , is within few tenths of 0.5 , significantly lower than the value estimated from ground - based samples of  forest lines at redshifts greater than @xmath101.7 .",
    "our values are consistent with the `` no evolution '' expectations .",
    "we show the results for the @xmath27   , @xmath28  sample in figure  [ fig : dndzuskp ] .",
    "the values of the k - s probability show that the power law is an excellent approximation of the distribution of lines at the redshift range covered in our sample .",
    "note that this disagrees with the result of kim , cristiani , & dodorico ( 2001 ) , who found that the break in @xmath29 slope occurred around @xmath30 .",
    "the results appear to depend only weakly on whether the  lines from metal systems are included in the sample .",
    "also , it can be seen in table  [ tab : dndz - hst ] that taking the proximity effect into account  by excluding the lines with @xmath31   results in an insignificant change in the estimates of the number density evolution index ; the difference is of the order of 1@xmath8 or less .",
    "the results agree qualitatively with the findings of the hst qsoal key project .",
    "weymann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have analyzed the complete key project  absorption line sample and also found that the evolution index , @xmath17 , is smaller than the one found for high - redshift samples .",
    "however , their values of @xmath17 for various subsamples range from @xmath32 to @xmath33 with uncertainties of @xmath34 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 that we find from our total fos sample are larger than those found by the key project by @xmath101.9@xmath8 in the case of the constant , 0.24    equivalent width threshold and by @xmath104.5@xmath8 in the case of a variable equivalent width threshold    a comparison of these two results is shown in figure  [ fig : dndzuskp ] , where we show our data and fit for @xmath35    ( solid line ) , and the @xmath29 vs.  @xmath2 curve ( dotted line ) for a comparable sample from weymann et al.(1998 ; their sample # 5 , which had @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "we see a comparable number of lines per unit redshift at low @xmath2 , but slightly ( ca .  15% ) more lines at @xmath38 .",
    "there are a few effects that may account for the discrepancy . as noted earlier ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zcoverage ] ) , our sample has larger redshift coverage and contains markedly more lines at @xmath14 .",
    "also , our sample excludes lines below  emission line .",
    "we determined the parameters of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dndz ] ) in a subsample of our data , containing only the objects we had in common with the key project .",
    "the results were in very good agreement with weymann et al.(1998 ) ; we show the data points and the fit on fig .",
    "[ fig : dndzuskp ] .",
    "specifically , we obtained @xmath39 for the @xmath27    sample , and @xmath40 for the variable threshold case , markedly lowering any discrepancy .",
    "also , the results show the same qualitative behavior of lowering the value of @xmath17 when limiting the analysis to the key project objects .",
    "the other effect that can influence the results is the exclusion of lines below  emission lines . in order to verify whether this can account for at least part of the discrepancy",
    ", we analyzed the line lists of the hst key project using our equivalent width threshold information and our metal system identifications for excluding spectral regions . including identified  lines blueward of emission",
    " as the key project did  we find @xmath41 and @xmath42 , for variable and 0.24  thresholds , respectively , in good agreement with the key project results .",
    "excluding lines blueward of  emission , we find @xmath43 and @xmath44 for variable and 0.24    thresholds , respectively , i.e.  no significant difference in both cases .",
    "we thus conclude that exclusion or inclusion of lines below  does not affect the results , and that the primary source of the discrepancy between our and weyman et al.s ( 1998 ) results lies in the difference in the sample coverage .",
    "it is known that @xmath29 steepens around @xmath45 .",
    "it is obvious from fig .  5 of weymann et al .  ( 1998 ) that if they included the @xmath46 quasar um18 in their sample ( it was excluded because of incomplete line identifications ; note that this object is included in the sample presented here ) , then their derived distribution would have been considerably steeper , in agreement with our result .",
    "it is possible that this , combined with the fact that we have better coverage at high-@xmath2 end of the sample , contributes to our deriving larger @xmath17 than the key project .",
    "we note , however , that the fact that k - s test shows that for our sample the power law is an excellent approximation of the number density evolution over the entire redshift range of our sample is in apparent contradiction to what inclusion of um18 would do to the key project sample , in which case their fit to a single power law would likely become worse .",
    "if the intergalactic medium evolves , then we expect that the observed @xmath17 could depend on equivalent width , or equivalently , the distribution of equivalent widths could be a function of redshift .",
    "weymann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found a trend of increasing @xmath17 with increasing line strength in the key project data .",
    "penton , shull , & stocke ( 2000 ) saw no difference in the evolution of strong and weak lines in the hst / ghrs sample .",
    "although the statistical significance is low , our results suggest that there appears to be a difference in the rate of evolution for weak and strong lines . in figure",
    "[ fig : hstdndz ] the solid line shows the evolution of the number density of absorbers for lines from one of the samples , with @xmath27   . on the same plot",
    ", we show the data and fits for two of its subsamples : the dashed line shows the sample with @xmath47   , the dotted line  @xmath48   . as in other plots , the data have been arbitrarily binned solely for presentation ; the lines show the fits to unbinned data .",
    "while number densities of strong and weak lines seem to be comparable in the present epoch , there are more ( by roughly 25% ) strong lines at @xmath1 . in principle , the dividing line between those two subsamples lies near the point where  lines leave the linear part of the curve of growth .",
    "therefore , one could try to interpret this result as an indication that the two subsamples are in fact two different populations of absorbers . however , there are two reasons why we regard this result with caution and avoid drawing far - reaching conclusions .",
    "first , the result is marginal .",
    "second , the same behavior would be expected to occur from line blending .",
    "two blending effects associated with increased density of lines at larger @xmath2 may affect the relative number of strong and weak lines : ( 1 ) two lines , both above the threshold , may blend into features indistinguishable from strong lines ( `` blending - out '' ) , or ( 2 ) two weak lines , both with  below the threshold , may blend , resulting in a feature that has combined width greater than the threshold ( `` blending - in '' ) .",
    "these two effects work in opposite directions , and they are hard to quantify , especially in spectra with limited resolution ( see , e.g. , parnell & carswell 1988 , liu & jones 1988 ) . if the first of those two effects dominates over the second , the result may appear as if there were more strong lines at higher redshifts .",
    "impey , petry , & flint ( 1999 ) reported marginal evidence for quasar - to - quasar variations in the number density of lines in their sample of 10 spectra taken with hst / ghrs .",
    "our sample , which contains 165 lines of sight , is particularly well suited to test whether there is structure in the distribution of  absorbers on very large scales .",
    "we find remarkably little scatter in the number of lines detected .",
    "for each object , we calculated the expected number of absorption lines by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : dndz ] ) over the usable parts of the spectrum , and compared it with the number of lines observed in the spectrum . figure  [ fig : dndzfluct ] shows the histogram of the deviations in units of the individual uncertainties .",
    "since the number of lines in each object can be small , the individual uncertainties were calculated using the gehrels ( 1986 ) approximation , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the predicted number of lines .",
    "if the distribution were random , then the histogram would be a gaussian with unit sigma .",
    "a dotted line in figure  [ fig : dndzfluct ] shows the predicted gaussian distribution .",
    "the observed distribution is in fact much _ narrower _ than random : the farthest outliers deviate by only @xmath51 , and there are only a handful of objects outside @xmath52 .",
    "the explanation is that the deviations in the number of lines detected in the fos spectra is not given by counting statistics .",
    "rather , the deviations reflect the uniformity of the intergalactic medium averaged over large scales .",
    "the size scale probed is given roughly by the @xmath53 between  and  emission lines of each quasar , or @xmath10750",
    "@xmath54  mpc at @xmath55 and @xmath10850  @xmath54  mpc at @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we will explore the uniformity of the line distribution in more detail in a future paper .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : dndz ] ) describes very well the distribution of rest equivalent widths of lines in the sample .",
    "we note , however , that the derived value of the equivalent width distribution parameter , , depends quite strongly on whether  lines associated with metal systems are included in the analyzed sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : wstarfit ] shows the distribution of equivalent widths in the @xmath58   , @xmath59  samples .",
    "clearly , inclusion of lines from metal systems , which ( as noted above ) tend to be strong , affects the slope of the observed distribution .",
    "it has been found that a simple power law , @xmath60 , describes the distribution of  forest column densities .",
    "analyses of high redshift data ( petitjean et al.1993 ; press & rybicki 1993 ; hu et al .  1995 ;",
    "dobrzycki & bechtold 1996 ; kim , cristiani , & dodorico 2001 ) showed that the value of @xmath61 is in the @xmath62 range .",
    "analysis of low redshift data from hst / ghrs ( penton , schull , & stocke 2000 ) indicated @xmath61 near the high end of this range , at @xmath63 .",
    "however , recent analysis by dav & tripp ( 2001 ) of high resolution hst / stis spectra of two quasars suggested that at low @xmath2 the distribution is even steeper , with @xmath64 .",
    "the fos data lack the spectral resolution to perform direct voigt profile fitting , which is necessary to derive the column density directly .",
    "however , because of the large size of the sample we can obtain precise measurements of the equivalent width distribution . since column density and equivalent width are related via the curve of growth ( see , e.g. , barcons & webb 1991 ; chernomordik & ozernoy 1993 ; penton , schull , & stocke 2000 ) , the distribution of line equivalent widths can give insight into the distribution of column densities .",
    "our data do not support the @xmath65 value of the column density distribution slope . for all our  forest subsamples",
    ", we get the equivalent width distribution parameter , , in the @xmath66    range with very low uncertainties , of the order of @xmath67    or less . this value of , when converted to the value of @xmath61 using the curve of growth , yields @xmath68 , depending on the doppler parameter distribution . in order to obtain the value of the slope in the vicinity of 2",
    ", we would have to have  from the @xmath69    range , which is inconsistent with our results .",
    "however , as barcons & webb ( 1991 ) pointed out , the relation between @xmath61 and @xmath70 may be affected by a subtle problem with line blending , or the presence of clustering of weak lines .",
    "since those effects are hard to quantify , it is possible that the discrepancy is in fact smaller .",
    "also , as noted above , the derivation of  is rather sensitive to the selection criteria in the sample .",
    "including / excluding lines associated with metal systems in the sample leads to distinctly different value of the distribution slope .",
    "this may help explain some of the discrepancy with the dav and tripp ( 2001 ) result .",
    "an important clue to the nature of the  absorption in quasar spectra is the clustering of lines in redshift space . in general",
    ", it is agreed that a weak clustering at scales of few hundred km / s is present in high redshift  forest ( rauch 1998 and references therein ; more recently liske et al .",
    "2000 ; penton , schull , & stocke 2000 ) . at low redshifts , ulmer ( 1996 )",
    "analyzed the line clustering in the spectra of 12 objects from the hst / fos key project ( 100 lines ) and reported a significant excess of line pairs at velocity separations of 250500  .",
    "more recently , vanden berk et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported positive correlation for similar velocity separations , though not as strong as ulmer , in a sample consisting of the combination of ulmer s sample and fos spectra of quasars in the galactic poles ( 217 absorption lines , 22 quasars ) ; they noted that the signal seems to be coming from a small set of line `` clumps '' in a few of the objects .",
    "impey , petry , & flint ( 1999 ) found excess of nearest - neighbor pairs at separations of 250500  in their sample of 139 lines from 10 hst / ghrs spectra , but they did not find any correlation function signal on any scales .",
    "however , penton , schull , & stocke ( 2000 ) reported a clustering signal for @xmath71  in their sample of 15 hst / ghrs spectra containing 111 lines .",
    "the critical factor in the analysis of line clustering is the number of the available objects ( i.e.  lines of sight ) , since correlating the line positions is possible only in one dimension .",
    "our sample is a superset of the ulmer sample and  with the exception of two quasars , ton155 and 1306 + 3021 , which did not meet our sample s criteria  of the vanden berk et al .  sample . in our data",
    "set that has comparable selection criteria ( @xmath27   , @xmath72  ) , we have 84 objects with 622 absorption lines , i.e.  seven times more lines of sight and six times more lines than ulmer and ca.four times more lines of sight and three times more lines than vanden berk et al .",
    "we calculated the correlation function by comparing the observed number of pairs of lines with the number counted in monte carlo simulations .",
    "we performed the simulations by drawing redshifts at random from the power - law distribution of @xmath29 ( eq .  [ [ eq : dndz ] ] ) inside ranges identical to those in which our sample was defined .",
    "each simulation was run until we had a total number of lines equal to the total number of lines in the real sample .",
    "we ran the simulations 10,000 times . to account for blending , we removed pairs with separations smaller than 250  .",
    "however , we do expect blending to play at least some role , so that the number of expected pairs in the simulations may be overestimated , primarily in the @xmath73  bin .",
    "the clustering results in our sample are shown in figure  [ fig : corr ] .",
    "solid crosses show the observed number of pairs in each velocity separation bin , while the dashed histogram shows the expected number of pairs , as calculated through the simulations .",
    "a key issue is the uncertainties of the observed data points .",
    "if the lines are clustered , simply taking the square root of the number of line pairs in each bin will cause the error of the bin to be underestimated .",
    "we calculated the error bars for the observed data points using a modified bootstrap technique , similar to the method used by fernndez - soto ( 1996 ) . in this method",
    ", one replaces parts of the spectra with randomly selected substitute parts of the spectra and then calculates the distribution of pairs , repeating this procedure a large number of times .",
    "it can be shown that the dispersion of pair counts in each bin is an unbiased estimate of the actual variance in this bin .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] , a weak correlation can be seen for @xmath74  .",
    "the signal is weak , though  as mentioned above  it is quite possible that line blending was not all accounted for in the simulations , leading to overestimating the expected number of pairs , thus mitigating the clustering signal .",
    "the correlation found in our data has lower amplitude than the one reported by ulmer ( 1996 ) or vanden berk et al .",
    "at least part of the difference can be explained if one looks into the sample used by ulmer ( and , consequently , vanden berk et al . ) in more detail .",
    "we first note that our selection criteria excluded regions containing the cluster of four pairs in ton  153 , since this region is bluewards of the  emission line . in regions that we have in common",
    ", we note the following differences :    \\1 . in pg  1352 + 011",
    ", ulmer has four close pairs , coming from lines near 1843 , 1846 , 1849 , 1852 , and 1855   .",
    "we present this region in figure  [ fig : kp2us1 ] . the line at 1843    was deblended by key project from a wing of a strong si line near 1841   . in our analysis",
    "( paper  iii ) it was not identified as a separate feature .",
    "we do see a line near 1849    ( paper  iii ) , but it has a detection significance of @xmath75 , which is too low to be included in the sample analyzed here .",
    "all these factors result in our sample only containing one close pair in this region , the 18521855 pair .    \\2 . in two pairs in ulmer s sample",
    " @xmath76 in 3c  351 and @xmath77 in pg  1634 + 706  we identify one of the pair components as a heavy element line rather than as a  line .",
    "this means that they are removed from consideration in our analysis of correlations .",
    "both these systems were considered by ulmer ( and vanden berk et al . ) to be  pairs .    in total , in the regions that we had in common , we do see five fewer close pairs .",
    "removal of those pairs lowers the number reported by ulmer ( 14 pairs ) by 36% , and the correlation signal ( i.e.  the ratio of @xmath78 ) by about half . indeed , as it has been found in previous studies ( heisler , hogan , & white 1989 ; bahcall et al .",

    "1999 ) , the correlation signal is dependent on a small handfull of line pairs .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrfun ] we show the results converted to the two point correlation function , @xmath79 . on the same plot",
    ", the dashed line shows ulmer s result .",
    "we show two data points for ulmer s results in the @xmath73  bin ; the bottom one is what his result would be if the five close pairs mentioned above were removed",
    ". please note that we examined in detail only the @xmath73  bin in ulmer s data and so we do not show how other velocity bins would be affected .",
    "obviously , the differences in line identifications and deblending accounts for some  but not all  of the difference between the correlation strengths .",
    "clustering of  lines at small velocity separations is predicted by cold dark matter ( cdm ) model simulations of the galaxy formation , the growth of large scale structure and subsequent evolution of the intergalactic medium ( cen et al .",
    "1998 ; dav et al .",
    "these models predict that the  absorbing gas traces the dark matter distribution more closely than galaxies , and so the 2-point correlation function of  clouds provides a different and complementary constraint on the formation of large scale structure than the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "the solid histogram on fig .",
    "[ fig : corrfun ] shows the galaxy - galaxy correlation function , taken as @xmath80 ( e.g.  davis & peebles 1983 ) .",
    "we see that the galaxy - galaxy correlation function is stronger than the  correlation function , as is predicted by the cdm simulations .",
    "analyses of fos data suggested that  forest lines may have a tendency to be found preferably near heavy element systems .",
    "this tendency appeared to be even stronger if one considered the `` extensive '' metal systems , i.e.  metal systems with four or more identified species ; those systems were often seen near `` clumps '' of  lines .",
    "see bahcall et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , jannuzi ( 1997 ) , and vanden berk et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . given scarcity of available systems ,",
    "those analyses were , for the most part , qualitative , though vanden berk et al .  reported some positive signal for metal system  forest correlation at @xmath81  for strong ( @xmath82   ) lines .    in the @xmath83   , @xmath59  sample ,",
    "we have 78 identified metal systems , 41 of which qualify as `` extensive '' .",
    "we analyzed the correlation of  forest vs.  those systems , using approach similar to the one used in the analysis of  forest correlations . in the simulations",
    ", we fixed the positions of the metal systems at their observed locations and selected locations of forest lines at random .",
    "we compared the simulated and observed pairs of absorbers , requiring that one of the pair components be a metal system .",
    "we do not see any correlation on any scale in both cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corrmetals ] ) .",
    "it is , however , clear that even the entire fos sample is somewhat too small for this test .",
    "we analyzed the redshift distribution of the  clouds at @xmath84 in the spectra of 165 quasars .",
    "the major results are the following .",
    "we confirm that the clouds at redshifts less than 1.7 undergo slow , if any , evolution .",
    "a single power law is an excellent approximation of the behavior of the number density evolution of lines at low redshift .",
    "we find the evolution of the cloud number density to be somewhat steeper that the one found by the hst key project , probably the result of a different proportion of @xmath85 lines in the two samples .    \\2 .",
    "we see marginal evidence for a difference between the evolution index for weak and strong lines .",
    "the weak lines undergo evolution in the opposite direction from the strong lines , i.e.  their number per comoving volume increases with decreasing redshift .",
    "the strong lines are consistent with the no - evolution case .",
    "we see weak clustering in the  forest for @xmath86  . however , the correlation is weaker than reported by ulmer ( 1996 ) or vanden berk et al .",
    "at least part of the difference can be accounted for by differences in details of the deblending and identification of a small number of absorption features . in all cases ,",
    "the clustering signal is smaller than that seen for galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "the fos data set is useful for many other quasar absorption line studies .",
    "paper  v reports the analysis of the proximity effect , and the evolution of the uv radiation field which may drive the evolution of @xmath29 for the  forest clouds derived here ( see paper  v and references therein for further discussion of this point ) . the results for clustering described in this paper can be confirmed or refuted with high resolution spectroscopy , currently planned or underway with stis on board hst .    ad would like to thank a. fernndez - soto for helpful comments on the bootstrapping technique .",
