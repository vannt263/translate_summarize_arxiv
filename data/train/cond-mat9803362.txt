    "<S> using the landauer formula and a random matrix model , we investigate the autocorrelation function of the conductance versus magnetic field strength for ballistic electron transport through few - channel microstructures with the shape of a classically chaotic billiard coupled to ideal leads . </S>",
    "<S> this function depends on the total number @xmath0 of channels and the parameter @xmath1 which measures the difference in magnetic field strengths . using the supersymmetry technique </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate for any value of @xmath0 the leading terms of the asymptotic expansion for small @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we pay particular attention to the evaluation of the boundary terms . for small values of @xmath0 , we supplement this analytical study by a numerical simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with the squared lorentzian suggested by semiclassical theory and valid for large @xmath0 . for small @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> we present evidence for non  analytic behavior of the autocorrelation function at @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 72.20.my,05.45.+b,72.20.dp    recent advances in semiconductor technology have made it possible to study experimentally the transport of ballistic electrons through microstructures @xcite with the shape of a classically chaotic billiard . </S>",
    "<S> two aspects of the dependence of the conductance @xmath3 on an external magnetic field @xmath4 have received @xcite particular attention : the suppression of weak localization at small values of @xmath4 , and the form of the conductance autocorrelation function @xmath5 . here , @xmath6 is the difference between the dimensionless conductance @xmath7 and its mean value . </S>",
    "<S> the bars indicate an average which experimentally is taken over the fermi energy or the applied gate voltage .    in a previous paper @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the generic form of the weak localization peak . in the present paper , we address the generic form of the conductance autocorrelation function @xmath8 . for ideal coupling between leads and microstructure , this function depends on the number @xmath0 of channels in the leads , and on @xmath1 , a measure of @xmath9 to be defined below .    </S>",
    "<S> several authors have calculated the autocorrelation function @xmath8 in an approximate way . in the semiclassical approximation @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 was found to have the form of a squared lorentzian . </S>",
    "<S> the semiclassical limit is expected to apply only when @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the non  diagonal terms in the gutzwiller trace formula are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> attempts to determine @xmath8 from a random matrix model for the scattering matrix with the help of a brownian motion model @xcite have not been successful . </S>",
    "<S> use of a random matrix model and the supersymmetry technique @xcite has confirmed the squared lorentzian shape of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> however , these were also asymptotic calculations valid in the limit @xmath10 and thus kin to the semiclassical approximation .    in the actual experiments @xcite , the number of channels per lead was quite small . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is not clear whether the theoretical results just mentioned apply to this situation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a theoretical study of the full autocorrelation function is of considerable interest in its own right . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath8 is a four  point function , and to the best of our knowledge it has not been possible so far to calculate this kind of function without approximation analytically , using a random matrix model as starting point . </S>",
    "<S> the work reported in this paper does not solve this problem fully either . </S>",
    "<S> however , we succeed in calculating analytically the leading terms in an asymptotic expansion of @xmath8 for small @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that in so doing , we display interesting and novel aspects of the supersymmetry technique , especially in relation to the boundary terms . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we are led to question whether @xmath8 is analytic in @xmath1 near @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> starting point is the random matrix model for the hamiltonians of the chaotic microstructure for two values of the external field . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is very close to that taken in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and also to our work on weak localization @xcite , except that we now have to deal with a four  point function . </S>",
    "<S> we use the landauer formula and efetov s supersymmetry technique @xcite in the form of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the leading terms of the asymptotic expansion of the autocorrelation function for small @xmath1 involves a generalization of the usual polar coordinates used for two  point functions . </S>",
    "<S> the transformation to these variables necessarily introduces the boundary or efetov  wegner terms into the formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we devote particular attention to these terms . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> integrals in polar coordinates over graded vectors have first been treated by parisi and sourlas @xcite , and over graded matrices by efetov @xcite and wegner , see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our central result given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ int - split-4b ] ) below has first been derived in a different way by efetov @xcite and by zirnbauer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation which we employ makes use of the method of boundary functions suggested by berezin @xcite . for a more general discussion of coordinate transformations in graded integrals </S>",
    "<S> we refer to the papers by rothstein @xcite , and by zirnbauer and haldane @xcite .    as a complement to the analytical work which yields only the leading terms of the asymptotic expansion </S>",
