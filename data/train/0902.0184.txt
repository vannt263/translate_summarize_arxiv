    "to fully specify the quark structure of the nucleon at twist two level , three parton distribution functions are needed : the well known momentum and helicity distribution @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the transversity distribution @xmath5 .",
    "this latter describes the probability density of finding transversely polarized quarks in a transversely polarized nucleon , and it is currently receiving a lot of attention , both from the experimental and from the theoretical point of view .    due to its chiral odd nature , the transversity pdfs must be coupled to another chiral - odd function in order to build an observable . for this reason , transversity can not be measured in dis experiments , but only in semi - inclusive dis experiments ( sidis ) , where at least one hadron in the final state is detected . in sidis ,",
    "different channels allow to access transversity : the azimuthal distribution of single hadrons , the azimuthal dependence of hadron pairs and the measurements of the transverse polarization of @xmath1 hyperons .",
    "all these channels have been investigated by the compass collaboration .",
    "compass  @xcite is a fixed target experiment at the cern sps , with a physics program focused on the study of the nucleon spin structure . from 2002 to 2004 , compass took data with a longitudinally polarized muon beam of 160  gev / c and a @xmath0lid target . for about the 20% of the time , the target nucleons have been polarized transversely with respect to the beam direction , in order to allow the measurements of transverse spin effects .",
    "the @xmath0lid material is characterized by a high dilution factor ( @xmath60.38 ) , and the polarization values p@xmath7 reached during data taking are around 50% .",
    "the transversity pdf can be accessed in single hadron production via the so called collins effect  @xcite . in this mechanism ,",
    "the fragmentation function of transversely polarized quarks into unpolarized hadrons is composed by two parts , an unpolarized and a polarized one , depending on the quark spin ( collins ff ) .",
    "more precisely , the ff shows an azimuthal dependence with respect to the plane defined by the quark momentum and the quark spin , meaning that the event yield can be written as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and p@xmath7 have been already introduced , and @xmath10 is the transverse spin transfer coefficient from the initial to the struck quark . the collins angle @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the angle of the transverse momentum of the outgoing hadron and @xmath14 is the azimuthal angle of the struck quark spin ( @xmath15 is the azimuthal angle of quark before the hard scattering ) .",
    "@xmath16 is the collins asymmetry , proportional to the convolution of the collins fragmentation function and the transversity distribution : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fraction of available energy carried by the hadron , and @xmath19 is the hadron transverse momentum with respect to the virtual photon direction . comparing the number of hadrons produced in sidis reactions on nucleons polarized transversely in opposite directions , the modulation given by the collins angle gives access to the asymmetry @xmath16 .    in order to select dis events in the data , interaction vertices with one incoming muon ,",
    "one scattered muon and at least one outgoing hadron have been selected . to select the dis regime , the photon virtuality @xmath20 is taken above 1 ( gev / c)@xmath21 , the fractional energy of the virtual photon @xmath22 between 0.1 and 0.9 , and the invariant mass of the final hadronic state @xmath23 above 5 gev / c@xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the following cuts on the hadron variables have been applied : @xmath24 and @xmath25 0.1 gev / c .",
    "after all the cuts applied , the total number of positive and negative hadrons is 7 and 8.5@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "r0.55        the collins asymmetries of unidentified hadrons  @xcite for the full statistics are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonid ] , as a function of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath19 .",
    "the asymmetries are small , and compatible with zero within the very good statistical accuracy , which is reaching @xmath291% in the central @xmath27 bins .",
    "the systematic errors , investigated with extensive studies , have been found to be well below the statistical precision .",
    "a nave interpretation of the results can be achieved in the parton model : restricting to the valence region , the small asymmetries on deuterium are due to a cancellation between the transversity pdf for the u and d quark .",
    "this result is valid even if the collins ff are opposite in sign and similar in size , as is suggested by the non zero asymmetries on a proton target measured by the hermes collaboration  @xcite .",
    "r0.55        in order to perform a more sophisticated flavor separation analysis , the hadrons in the final state have to be identified . in compass ,",
    "charged kaons and pions are identified a rich  @xcite . due to the different cherenkov thresholds , pions and kaons can be identified for momenta larger than @xmath293  gev / c and 10  gev / c , respectively , and up to 50  gev / c , that corresponds to a 1.5  @xmath30 @xmath31-k mass separation .",
    "neutral kaons have been selected in the data from the invariant mass of the decay products .",
    "after the selection , the invariant mass spectra show a peak at the @xmath32 mass , with a signal - to - background ratio around 15 . the final sample of @xmath32s for the analysis has been selected considering a @xmath3320  mev / c@xmath21 mass window around the @xmath32 mass .",
    "the final statistics consists of 5.2 and 4.5@xmath26 @xmath34 and @xmath35 , 0.9 and 0.6@xmath26 @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and 0.25@xmath26 @xmath32 .",
    "the results obtained for pions and kaons  @xcite are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pik ] . also here , the asymmetries are small and compatible with zero within the statistical errors .",
    "the collins asymmetry is not the only possible single spin asymmetry that can be measured with a transversely polarized target . in the complete sidis cross section expression ,",
    "8 structure functions depending on the transverse target polarization are present , yielding 8 asymmetries with independent azimuthal modulations .",
    "the sivers asymmetries is the most famous one ; it is related to the sivers pdf , that gives a measurement of the correlation of the intrinsic transverse momentum of an unpolarized quark in a transversely polarized nucleon .",
    "results for the sivers asymmetries have been provided for unidentified  @xcite and identified hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the measured sivers asymmetries are very small and compatible with zero , indicating also in this case a cancellation between the u and d - quark contribution in an isoscalar target .",
    "another mechanism sensitive to the transversity pdf is the two hadrons production .",
    "the event selection for this analysis is the same as described for the single hadron analysis , apart for the lower cut on the hadron @xmath28 , that has been released to 0.1 .",
    "all the events with at least two hadrons in the final state have been considered , and a cut on the sum of the relative energies , @xmath38 , has been applied to remove exclusive production .    as for the collins mechanism , the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark into a pair of hadrons is expected to depend on an azimuthal angle  @xcite , yielding for the number of events : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 ; @xmath42 is the azimuthal angle between the lepton scattering plane and the plane containing the virtual photon momentum * q * and the component @xmath43 of the relative hadron momentum * * r**@xmath44(*p@xmath45 * -*p@xmath46 * ) which is perpendicular to the summed hadron momentum * * p@xmath47**@xmath48**p@xmath45**+*p@xmath46*. the asymmetry @xmath49 is proportional to the transversity function convoluted with the fragmentation function describing the two hadrons production , @xmath50 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the invariant mass of the hadron pair .",
    "two different analyses have been performed . in the first one ,",
    "the hadron pair is composed of a positive and a negative hadron : the hadrons have been identified with the rich , so that four combinations have been considered : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 . in the second analysis , the hadrons have been ordered considering the leading and sub - leading hadrons ( defined by the corresponding @xmath28 ) ; in this analysis , also combination of hadrons with the same charge are possible , leading to 16 combinations .",
    "all these asymmetries have been measured as a function of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath57 .",
    "no clear indication of a signal different from zero has been obtained from all the measurements .",
    "in 2002 - 2004 compass has provided a complete set of measurement of transverse spin effects using a deuterium target .",
    "all the measured asymmetries are small and compatible with zero , implying a cancellation between the u and d - quark contribution in a isoscalar target .    99 slides : + ` http://indico.cern.ch/contributiondisplay.py?contribid=277&sessionid=22&confid=24657 `",
