    "realistic quantum systems interact and exchange information with their surroundings . the engineering of the decoherence and the flow of information between an open quantum system and its environment has recently allowed , e.g. , to drive quantum computation by dissipation  @xcite , to control entanglement and quantum phases in many - body systems  @xcite , to create an open system quantum simulator  @xcite , and to control the transition from markovian dynamics to a regime with quantum memory effects  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there has been recently rapid progress in understanding various fundamental issues on quantum non - markovianity  @xcite .    in general , the power of quantum information processing is based on the presence of quantum correlations in multipartite systems .",
    "however , as any realistic quantum system , those systems are vulnerable to the detrimental effects of the environment such as the loss of coherence and information . depending on its physical composition , an open multipartite system can interact either with a single common environment or each of the sub - parties can interact locally with their own reservoirs .",
    "the latter case , which is in the focus of our paper , is a common scenario , e.g. , in quantum information processing and entanglement dynamics  @xcite , and in energy transport in biological organisms  @xcite .",
    "the central question to be studied here is , can a composite open quantum system exploit during its time evolution the information carried initially by the environmental degrees of freedom , i.e. , the information to which it does not have access initially ? on the basis of a recent theoretical prediction  @xcite , we demonstrate experimentally that initial correlations between local parts of the environment lead to nonlocal memory effects and allow to protect and maintain genuine quantum properties of an open system .",
    "we will show further that the non - markovian dynamics of photonic open systems provides a diagnostic tool for characteristic features of their environments .",
    "our experimental open system consists of the polarization degrees of freedom of a pair of entangled photons .",
    "the photon pair is created by spontaneous parametric down - conversion after which the photons travel along different arms @xmath0 and move through different quartz plates of variable thickness ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the quartz plates act as birefringent media which lead to a local coupling between the polarization degrees of freedom of the photon in arm @xmath1 and its frequency ( mode ) degrees of freedom forming its local environment .",
    "this local interaction can be described by a local unitary operator which is defined by @xmath2 denotes the state of the photon in arm @xmath1 with polarization @xmath3 ( horizontal or vertical ) and frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the refraction index for photons with polarization @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath6 , and @xmath7 represents the interaction time .     experimental setup .",
    "maximally entangled photon pairs are generated by parametric down conversion ( pdc ) with an ultraviolet ( uv ) pump pulse whose spectral width can be controlled .",
    "then a series of quartz plates are added in arm @xmath8 and arm @xmath9 to realize the local dephasing channels .",
    "the final two - photon polarization state is analyzed by state tomography .",
    "key to the components : nc  nonlinear crystal , fp  fabry - prot cavity , dm  dispersion medium , hwp  half wave plate , qwp  quarter wave plate , if  interference filter , qp  quartz plate , pbs  polarizing beamsplitter , and spd  single photon detector.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    any pure initial state for the polarization degrees of freedom of the photon pair , which forms our bipartite open system , can be written as @xmath10 .",
    "the total system initial states are assumed to be product states @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the probability amplitude for the photon in arm @xmath8 to have frequency @xmath13 and for the photon in arm @xmath9 to have frequency @xmath14 , with the corresponding joint probability distribution @xmath15 .",
    "the time evolution of the open system can be represented by means of the dynamical map @xmath16 @xcite which maps the initial polarization state @xmath17 to the polarization state state @xmath18 at time @xmath19 . calculating the total system time evolution and taking the trace over the environment yields",
    "@xcite @xmath20 the dynamics represents a pure dephasing process whose decoherence functions can be expressed completely in terms of the fourier transform of the joint probability distribution @xmath21 as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the birefringence .",
    "the function @xmath27 describes the decoherence of the polarization state of photon @xmath1 which is induced by the local coupling to its frequency environment caused by the quartz plate in arm @xmath1 .",
    "this can be seen by taking the trace over the polarization state of photon 2 to obtain the polarization state of photon 1 : @xmath28 or by tracing over photon 1 to find the state of photon 2 : @xmath29      the nonlocal character of the dynamical map @xmath30 is controlled by the decoherence functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ rho12 ] ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", the map @xmath30 is a product of local dynamical maps , i.e. , @xmath33 if and only if @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in particular , this implies that frequency correlations in the initial state do not influence the local dynamics of each photon and can not be detected by observing the local polarization states .",
    "however , the evolution of the composite two - photon polarization state is determined by the frequency correlations in the environment which lead to memory effects and global non - markovian dynamics .",
    "this also means that , counterintuitively , by adding degrees of freedom to an open system one can change its dynamics from the markovian to the non - markovian regime .",
    "to quantify non - markovianity we use the trace distance based measure @xcite which is defined by @xmath36 . here , @xmath37 and the trace distance @xmath38 between two states @xmath39 and @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 .",
    "the amount of non - markovianity is therefore equal to the total increase of the trace distance during the time evolution and quantifies the total information flow from the environment to the system .",
    "this measure has been used recently in several theoretical and experimental contexts , see , e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "trace distance dynamics for different values of the spectral width of the pump pulse .",
    "the widths and the amounts of non - markovianity are : ( a ) @xmath42 , @xmath43 , ( b ) @xmath44 , @xmath45 , ( c ) @xmath46 , @xmath47 , ( d ) @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath50-axis represents time measured by the total effective path difference between the horizontal and vertical photons caused by quartz plates in arms @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the @xmath52-axis is the trace distance between the time - evolved initial open system states @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we first add quartz plates in arm 1 .",
    "when the total effective path difference between horizontal and vertical photons equals @xmath55 , we add quartz plates in arm 2 .",
    "the solid line shows the fit using the theoretical result of eq .",

    "these states are created by using spontaneous parametric down conversion as is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "a femtosecond pulse ( the duration is about @xmath58 and the operation wavelength is at @xmath59 , with a repetition rate of about @xmath60 ) generated from a ti : sapphire laser is frequency doubled to pump two @xmath8mm - thick beamlike cut beta barium borate ( bbo ) crystals  @xcite creating the two - photon entangled state . with the help of",
    "qwp1 we can easily tune the entangled state between @xmath61 ( qwp1 is set at @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 ( qwp1 is set at @xmath64 ) .",
    "the size of the anticorrelations between the photon frequencies is controlled in the experiment by the spectrum of the uv pump pulse .",
    "since energy is conserved in the down conversion process , decreasing the spectral width of the pump pulse decreases the uncertainty of the sum of the frequencies of the photons , and hence increases the anticorrelation between the frequencies .",
    "we use four different pulse widths as described in more detail in the methods section .",
    "it is also worth noting that even though our experimental setup is based on downconversion , which is a commonly used tool to prepare specific two - photon states in quantum optical experiments , the physical phenomena that we describe and realize experimentally was theoretically predicted only very recently  @xcite .",
    "trace distance dynamics of the open system with different dispersions of the pump pulse .",
    "the quartz plate on the path of the pump pulse has thickness ( a ) @xmath65 ( b ) @xmath66 ( c ) @xmath67 . in all cases @xmath68 and the measured values of non - markovianity are @xmath69 . the trace distance dynamics remains the same irrespective of the character of the correlations .",

    "the local decoherence induced by the quartz plates in arm @xmath8 and arm @xmath9 act consecutively , and we change the size of the initial correlations between the local reservoirs by tuning the spectral width of the pump pulse .",
    "the results for the open system s trace distance dynamics are displayed in fig .  2 , which shows how the initial environmental correlations induce and influence the quantum non - markovianity .",
    "first , when only the quartz plate in arm @xmath8 is active , the trace distance decreases monotonically demonstrating that information flows continuously from the system to the environment .",
    "when subsequently the quartz plate in arm @xmath8 becomes inactive and the quartz plate in arm @xmath9 active , the trace distance increases again highlighting non - markovian behavior and a reversed flow of information from the environment back to the open system .",
    "it is important to note that this increase of the trace distance implies a revival of the entanglement between the photon polarizations . whilst there exists earlier literature , e.g. , on how the entanglement is transferred from the open system to the environment  @xcite , or on entanglement dynamics when the qubits interact with local non - markovian reservoirs  @xcite ,",
    "our results are fundamentally different .",
    "we demonstrate that the entanglement can revive due to the nonlocal character of the dynamical map despite of the fact that the local interaction of the qubits with their environments is completely markovian .",
    "a further important aspect of the experimental scheme is that it enables to measure the frequency correlation coefficient @xmath72 of the photon pairs by fitting the theoretical prediction of eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) to the experimental data .",
    "the fits shown in fig .  2 corresponding to panels ( a)-(d ) yield the values @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "thus we see that the open system ( polarization degrees of freedom ) functions as a quantum probe which allows us to gain nontrivial information on the correlations in the environment ( frequency degrees of freedom ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our results present the first quantitative measurement of the correlation coefficient without reconstructing the joint frequency distribution .",
    "the open system dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ rho12 ] ) depends solely on the decoherence functions @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 which in turn are completely determined by the fourier transform of the joint frequency distribution @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , also the dynamical map of the open system depends only on @xmath70 and not on the probability amplitudes @xmath12 .",
    "this fact leads to the conclusion that the nonlocal memory effects , and the revival of entanglement observed above , do not depend on the specific phase relations between different frequency components , and consequently , whether the initial frequency correlations between the photons are of quantum or classical character . to test",
    "experimentally whether the nature of the correlations plays a role in inducing the memory effects , we insert quartz plates also on the path of the pump pulse , thereby changing the dispersion relations of the pump pulse while keeping fixed the correlation coefficient @xmath72 . the results in fig .",
    "3 show that the trace distance dynamics remains the same in this case and only depends on the correlation coefficient @xmath72 of the photon frequencies .",
    "thus we see that nonlocal memory effects and the revival of the entanglement between the polarization states of the photons can be induced by purely classical correlations between local environments of the open system .",
    "trace distance dynamics for five different quartz plate configurations and a fixed correlation coefficient of @xmath76 . for all curves the maximal length of the quartz plates in both arms is @xmath55 , giving a maximal total effective path difference of @xmath84 . from top to bottom , the curves show the results for the cases , when we start to add quartz plates to arm @xmath9 when the length of the plate in arm @xmath8 has reached the length of @xmath85 respectively , see the methods section for details .",
    "hence , in the top curve the quartz plates are added simultaneously to both arms while in the bottom curve they act consecutively .",
    "the results demonstrate that the final state is the same while in terms of the information flow the behaviour is completely different . for",
    "the top ( red ) curve information flows slowly out of the system with a small rate and , in fact , the decoherence would completely halt in the ideal ideal case of fully anticorrelated frequencies ( @xmath86 ) . in the other extreme , for the bottom",
    "( violet ) curve information first flows out of the system with a high rate and later on returns back nearly completely indicating strong memory effects .",
    "the solid lines are fits on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) , see the methods section for details , scaledwidth=50.0% ]      in the previous experiments the local dephasing environments acted consecutively . in our final experimental series",
    "we reposition the quartz plates in arm 2 so that eventually the dephasing is active simultaneously in both arms ( see the methods section ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "we observe that the final state of the open system is always the same when the total effective path difference is equal to @xmath84 .",
    "however , the amount of non - markovianity and the flow of information from the environment to the open system decreases with increasing overlap of the action of the quartz plates .",
    "this demonstrates that initial correlations between the local environments and the reordering of the quartz plates allow to engineer the information flow between local systems while keeping fixed the final state .",
    "it is also important to note that when the local dephasing channels act simultaneously on our open bipartite system ( the top red curve in fig .  4 )",
    ", the initial correlations between the composite environments protect the entanglement between the qubits .",
    "one can see this also from eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) which shows that for @xmath87 and @xmath88 the trace distance remains constant and that there is thus no outflow of information from the system for the considered bell - states .",
    "we have realized nonlocal quantum dynamical maps of a photonic system and demonstrated experimentally how initial quantum or even classical correlations between the local environments of a composite open system induce nonlocal memory effects . while the global dynamics of the open system is non - markovian , its local subsystems behave perfectly markovian .",
    "the observation of the open system dynamics yields also important information about the environment .",
    "in fact , we have seen that a measurement of the non - markovian evolution of the two - photon polarization state leads to a novel method for the determination of the correlation coefficient of the photon frequencies .",
    "thus , the open system dynamics can be viewed as a non - markovian quantum probe which enables to extract nontrivial information on characteristic features of the environment .",
    "this fact as well as our demonstration that initial correlations in the environment can protect the entanglement within an open system , could find important applications in quantum technologies and control strategies , and in the development of novel diagnostics tools for complex quantum systems .",
    "the width of the pump spectrum controls the frequency anticorrelations between the pair of photons created in the down conversion process . by using filters and",
    "fused silica plates , we can control the width of the pump pulses which are depicted in fig .",
    "the laser source is filtered to @xmath89 ( fwhf ) and then passes through the frequency doubler ( @xmath90 thick bib@xmath91o@xmath92 ) .",
    "hence , the bandwidth of the uv pulse is about @xmath93 as shown in fig .  5 ( b ) .",
    "to obtain a sharper spectrum , as shown in fig .  5 ( a ) , we insert a thin fused silica plate , which is @xmath94 thick and coated with a partial reflecting coating on each side , with approximately @xmath95% at @xmath96 . for the spectra displayed in fig .  5 ( c ) and ( d )",
    ", we have no filter before the doubler and no fused silica plate after the doubler , and for fig .  5 ( d ) we also replace the doubler by a @xmath97-thick bbo .",
    "the details of the counting statistics and pump power for the experimental results of fig .",
    "2 are as follows . for fig .",
    "2 ( a ) the pump power is about @xmath98 and the total coincident count rate on the basis vectors hh , hv , vh , vv is about @xmath99 in @xmath100 seconds , ( b ) @xmath101 and the rate is about @xmath102 in @xmath103 seconds , ( c ) @xmath104 and the rate is about @xmath102 in @xmath9 seconds , and ( d ) @xmath104 and rate is about @xmath105 in @xmath103 seconds . please note that the coincident count rate always depends also on the bandwidth of uv pump source .      employing eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the theoretical fits of the experimental data presented in figs .  2 and 3 have been carried out as follows .",
    "we first use the function @xmath106 to make a fit for the process when the quartz plates are added to arm 1 . from this process , we can find @xmath107 and @xmath108 which agree with the experimental data . then in the second part , when the quartz plate in arm 2 is active , we use the function @xmath109 $ ] . here , @xmath110 corresponds to the effective path difference after the first quartz plate .",
    "since @xmath107 and @xmath108 are determined by the first fit , we can easily determine @xmath72 from the second fit .    for fig .  4 , again keeping in mind eq .",
