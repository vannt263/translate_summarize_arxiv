    "modal expansion methods have recently been used to study non - perturbative phenomena in quantum field theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "modal field theory , the name for the  general procedure , consists of two main parts .",
    "the first is to approximate field theory as a finite - dimensional quantum mechanical system .",
    "the second is to analyze the properties of the reduced system using one of several computational techniques .",
    "the quantum mechanical approximation is generated by decomposing field configurations into free wave modes .",
    "this technique has been explored using both spherical partial waves ( spherical field theory @xcite@xcite ) and periodic box modes ( periodic field theory @xcite ) .",
    "having reduced field theory to a more tractable quantum mechanical system , we have several different ways to proceed .",
    "boson interactions in euclidean space , for example , can be modeled using the method of diffusion monte carlo .",
    "in many situations , however , monte carlo techniques are inadequate .",
    "these include unquenched fermion systems , processes in minkowski space , and the phenomenology of multi - particle states .",
    "difficulties arise when the functional integral measure can not be treated as a probability distribution or when information must be extracted from excited states obscured by dominant lower lying states .",
    "fortunately there are several alternative methods in the modal field formalism which avoid these problems .",
    "matrix runge - kutta techniques were introduced in @xcite as a method for calculating unquenched fermion interactions .  here",
    "we discuss a different approach , one which directly calculates the spectrum and eigenstates of the hamiltonian .  for this approach",
    "it is essential that the hamiltonian is time - independent , and so we will consider periodic rather than spherical field theory .",
    "as we demonstrate , these methods naturally accommodate the study of multi - particle states and minkowskian dynamics .",
    "we apply the spectral approach to @xmath0 dimensional @xmath1 theory in a periodic box and calculate the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath2 propagator",
    ".  some interesting properties of @xmath3 theory such as the phase transition at large coupling were already discussed within the modal field formalism using euclidean monte carlo techniques @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this analysis is of a more general and exploratory nature .",
    "our aim is to test the viability of modal diagonalization techniques for quantum field hamiltonians .",
    "we would like to know whether we can clearly see multi - particle phenomena , the size of the errors and computational limitations with current computer resources , and how such methods might be extended to more complicated higher dimensional field theories .",
    "the spectral method presented in the first part of our analysis is similar to the work of brooks and frautschi @xcite , who considered a @xmath0 dimensional yukawa model in a periodic box and deserves credit for the first application of diagonalization techniques using plane wave modes in a periodic box .",
    "our calculations are also similar in spirit to diagonalization - based hamiltonian lattice formulations @xcite and tamm - dancoff light - cone and discrete  light - cone quantization @xcite-@xcite",
    ".  there are , however , some differences which we should mention .  as in @xcite we are using a momentum lattice rather than a spatial lattice .",
    "we find this convenient to separate out invariant subspaces according to total momentum quantum numbers .",
    "since we are using an equal time formulation our eigenvectors are not boost invariant as they would be on the light cone .",
    "also we are using a simple momentum cutoff scheme rather than a regularization scheme which includes tamm - dancoff fock - space truncation .  as a result",
    "our renormalization procedure is relatively straightforward , but we will have to confront the problem of diagonalizing large fock spaces from the very beginning .  in the latter part of the paper we mention current work on quasi - sparse eigenvector methods which can handle even exceptionally large fock spaces .  despite the differences among the various diagonalization approaches to field theory , the issues and problems discussed in our analysis are of a general nature .",
    "we hope that the ideas presented here will be of use for the various different approaches .",

    "we should stress that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are only auxiliary cutoffs .",
    "we increase these parameters until the physical results appear close to the asymptotic limit @xmath35 .  in our scheme ultraviolet regularization",
    "is provided only by the momentum cutoff parameter @xmath6 .",

    ", @xmath36 is the hamiltonian for a finite - dimensional quantum mechanical system and the results should converge in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "we obtain the desired field theory result by then taking the limit @xmath40 .",
    "we have calculated the matrix elements of @xmath36 restricted to @xmath33 using a symbolic differentiation - integration algorithm and diagonalized @xmath36 , obtaining both eigenvalues and eigenstates .",

    "we are primarily interested in @xmath44 , a quantity that can not be obtained for @xmath47 using monte carlo methods .",
    "since the imaginary part of @xmath46 is a delta function , it is easy to distinguish the single - particle and multi - particle contributions in a plot of the imaginary part of @xmath41 .",
    "the real part of @xmath41 , however , is dominated by the one - particle pole .",
    "for this reason we have chosen to plot the real part of @xmath44 rather than that of @xmath41 .",
    "although we have referred to multi - particle states , it should be noted that in our finite periodic box there are no true continuum multi - particle states .",
    "instead we find densely packed discrete spectra with level separation of size @xmath48 which become continuum states in the limit @xmath49 .",
    "we can approximate the contribution of these @xmath50 continuum states by a simple smoothing process .",
    "we included a small width @xmath51 to each of the would - be continuum states and averaged over a range of values for @xmath38 .  for the results we report here we have averaged over values @xmath52  for convenience all units",
    "have been scaled such that @xmath53 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 was adjusted to reduce the errors due to the finite cutoff values @xmath29 and @xmath30 .  since the spectrum of @xmath36",
    "is bounded below , errors due to finite @xmath29 and @xmath30 generally drive the estimated eigenvalues higher .",
    "one strategy , therefore , is to optimize @xmath23 by minimizing the trace of @xmath36 restricted to the subspace @xmath33 .",
    "the approach used here is a slight variation of this  we have minimized the trace of @xmath36 restricted to a smaller subspace @xmath54 .  the aim is to accelerate the convergence of the lowest energy states rather than the entire space @xmath37 .  throughout our analysis",
    "we used @xmath55    for @xmath56 we have plotted the imaginary part of @xmath41 in figure 1 and the real part of @xmath44 in figure 2@xmath43  the value @xmath56 is above the threshold for reliable perturbative approximation . ]",
    "( @xmath57 ) but below the critical value at which @xmath58 symmetry breaks spontaneously ( @xmath59  the contribution of the one - particle state appears near @xmath60 and the three - particle threshold is at approximately @xmath61 .  we have chosen several different values for @xmath62 to show the convergence as these parameters become large .",
    "the plot for @xmath63 appears relatively close to the asymptotic limit .",
    "the somewhat bumpy texture of the curves is due to the finite size of our periodic box and diminishes with increasing @xmath38 .  from dimensional power counting",
    ", we expect errors for finite @xmath6 to scale as @xmath64 .",
    "assuming that @xmath29 and @xmath30 also function as uniform energy cutoffs , we expect a similar error dependence  and it appears plausible from the results in figures 1 and 2 .  a more systematic analysis of the errors and extrapolation methods for finite @xmath65 , and @xmath66 will be discussed in future work .    in figures 3 and 4",
    "we have compared our spectral calculations with the two - loop perturbative result for @xmath67 .",
    "we have used @xmath63 , and the agreement appears good .  for small",
    "@xmath68 the propagator has a very prominent logarithmic cusp at the three - particle threshold , which can be seen clearly in figures 3 and 4 .    in figures 5 and 6",
    "we have compared results for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "we have again used @xmath63 .",
    "in contrast with the quadratic scaling in the perturbative regime , the results here scale approximately linearly with @xmath68 .",
    "an interesting and perhaps related observation is that the magnitude of the multi - particle contribution to @xmath41 remains small @xmath72 ) even for the rather large coupling value @xmath73 .",
    "we now address the computational limits of the diagonalization techniques presented in this work .",
    "these techniques are rather straightforward and can in principle be generalized to any field theory .  in practise",
    "however the fock space @xmath37 becomes prohibitively large , especially for higher dimensional theories .",
    "the data in figures 1 and 2 and crosschecks with euclidean monte carlo results suggest that for @xmath74and @xmath75 our spectral results with @xmath76 and @xmath77 are within 20% of the @xmath78 limit .",
    "@xmath79 in this case @xmath37 is a @xmath80 dimensional space and requires about 100 mb of ram using general ( dense ) matrix methods .",
    "sparse matrix techniques such as the lanczos or arnoldi schemes allow us to push the dimension of the fock space to about 10@xmath81 states",
    ".  this may be sufficient to do accurate calculations near the critical point @xmath82 for larger values of @xmath38 and @xmath83  it is , however , near the upper limit of what is possible using current computer technology and existing algorithms .",
    "unfortunately field theories in @xmath84 and @xmath85 dimensions will require much larger fock spaces , probably at least 10@xmath86 and 10@xmath87 states respectively .  in order to tackle these larger fock spaces",
    "it is necessary to venture beyond standard diagonalization approaches .",
    "the problem of large fock spaces ( @xmath8810@xmath89 states ) is beyond the intended scope of this analysis .",
    "but since it is of central importance to the diagonalization approach to field theory we would like to briefly comment on current work being done which may resolve many of the difficulties .",
    "the new approach takes advantage of the sparsity of the fock - space hamiltonian and the approximate ( quasi-)sparsity of the eigenvectors .",
    "a detailed description will be provided in a future publication @xcite .",
    "we start with some observations about the eigenvectors of the @xmath90 hamiltonian for @xmath91 @xmath92 and @xmath93  to make certain that we are probing non - perturbative physics we will set @xmath94 the approximate critical point value .",
