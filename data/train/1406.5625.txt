    "a very interesting test of qcd in the high energy limit is provided by dijet events with associated rapidity gaps . as originally pointed out by mueller and tang @xcite , this type of events , when the tagged jets are far apart in rapidity , allow for the study of the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) hard pomeron  @xcite at finite momentum transfer @xmath0 .",
    "absence of hadronic activity over a large region in rapidity @xmath1 suggests that an important contribution to the dijet cross - section is due to configurations with color singlet exchange in the @xmath2-channel .",
    "such exchange is well described by the non - forward bfkl green s function with finite momentum transfer . unlike the case of zero momentum transfer , which describes the rise of total cross - sections and has been investigated for a number of observables ( see _ e.g. _",

    "given the importance of the nlo corrections to both impact factors and green s function found in the forward limit , a similar study in the non - forward case is mandatory .",

    ", we finally verify that all remaining singularities are removed by renormalization of the qcd lagrangian and collinear factorization .",
    "while , in general , infrared finiteness is to be expected , it presents an important result in the present context , given the notoriously complicated perturbative qcd environment for jet - gap - jet events .",

    "we are interested in the hadron - hadron scattering process @xmath6 with two jets produced in the final state separated by a large rapidity gap , which is characterized by no hadronic activity in the detectors .",
    "in addition we limit ourselves to color singlet exchange in the the @xmath2-channel .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , the latter constraint is at first a theoretical one and it remains a task for future phenomenological analysis to determine those observabels for which this configuration is dominant . for an interesting proposal in this direction see @xcite .    with quark exchange in the @xmath2-channel suppressed by a factor @xmath7",

    "it constitutes therefore a nnlo correction , relative to the conventional dijet cross - section .",
    "while this is beyond the reach of current exact calculations , the presence of a large rapidity gap suggests that a description of this process in terms of high energy factorized amplitudes can provide a good approximation to the full result . to this end",
    "we define light - cone vectors as rescaled light - like momenta of the incoming hadrons @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",

    "resummation of @xmath20 enhanced terms to all orders in the strong coupling @xmath5 is then achieved through replacing the transverse gluon propagators with the non - forward bfkl green s function @xmath21 , where the latter is obtained as a solution to the non - forward bfkl equation .",

    "apparently both transverse integrals in eq .",
    "are divergent and a suitable infrared regulator is needed .",
    "this divergence is in principle also present in the ( lo ) green s function .",
    "however , in the asymptotic limit @xmath25 , the dependence on the infrared regulator vanishes and the result turns out to be finite @xcite . the combination with an approach resumming logarithms in the jet transverse momentum and the gap resolution @xmath3 , including a matching of singularities at finite perturbative orders of the bfkl green s function has been discussed in @xcite . in the following we assume that these singularities are addressed in a suitable way , either through a suitable matching and/or by working in the strict asymptotic limit @xmath25 . in particular ,",
    "the integrals over transverse momentum are assumed to yield a finite result .    to calculate the nlo impact factors it is needed to determine both the 1-loop corrections to the process  ( [ eq : partoniclo ] ) and the leading order process @xmath26 with color singlet exchange in one of the @xmath2-channels @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the 1-loop corrections to eq .",

    "as the non - forward bfkl green s function generates no real emissions , the entire @xmath23 dependence is for this particular process contained in the virtual corrections to the impact factors .",
    "as verified in @xcite , the @xmath23 dependence cancels if the all - order green s function is truncated at nlo .    both at lo and nlo ,",
    "it is necessary to restrict the phase space of the final state system , to avoid particle emissions into the forbidden gap region . to be more precise",
    ", we will require that the invariant mass of the diffractive system in the forward region of each proton to be smaller than a certain upper cut - off @xmath29 , set by experiment . at lo , contributions to the diffractive system",
    "are due to initial state radiation , which is encoded in the parton distribution functions , while at nlo this includes also contributions from the produced partonic system . for the diffractive system in the forward region of the proton with momentum @xmath30",

    "it is related to the diffractive mass at hadronic level through @xmath35 the constraint @xmath36 leads then to the following lower bound on the proton momentum fraction of the incoming parton @xmath37 while at nlo , in addition , the phase space of the partonic quark - gluon final state system is constrained .    to obtain the dijet cross - section from the partonic process",
    ", we further require a function which selects the configurations contributing to the particular choice of jet definition made in an experiment from the full partonic final state phase space .",
    "formally , this is achieved through the convolution with a distribution @xmath38 , which contains the details about the chosen jet algorithm .",
    "schematically , the partonic differential cross - section reads @xmath39 with @xmath40 the jet phase space and @xmath41 the @xmath2-channel transverse momentum transfer . at leading order",
    ", @xmath42 coincides with the transverse momentum of the jet and the jet functions are trivial .",
    "they map each of the final state quarks with one of the jets through @xmath43 in particular , due to the large rapidity gap spanned between the two jets , the quark with momentum @xmath44 corresponds directly to the jet with momentum @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "the full nlo treatment will be addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : jet ] .",
    "we stress that in addition to the phase space of the two jets , the cross - section eq .",
    "is also differential in the ( transverse ) momentum transfer through the gap region .",
    "as long as lo impact factors are used , the cross - section describes essentially elastic quark - quark scattering and this momentum transfer is identical to the transverse jet momentum .",
    "as soon as the diffractive system contains other objects than the jet , scattering is no longer elastic and both transverse momenta deviate . in principle , this quantity is measurable as the total transverse momentum of the diffractive systems . in practical applications , the cross - section of eq .",
    "is probably too differential and one would prefer to integrate over some of the variables .",
    "a possibility is to make the deviation from purely elastic scattering explicit through the following parametrization of the jet transverse momenta @xmath47 and to integrate both over @xmath48 and @xmath42 as well as the overall rapidity @xmath49 , resulting into a cross - section differential in the mean transverse momentum @xmath50 and the rapidity difference of the two jets . here",
    "we focus on the determination of impact factors and leave such details concerning the construction of suitable observables out of the ( maximal ) differential cross - section as a task for a future phenomenological studies .    to the end of describing the full hadronic process of eq .",

    "( [ eq : djetsigma ] ) with parton distribution functions . in principle",
    ", the use of collinear factorization can be questioned for this type of processes since soft re - scattering of the hadron remnants can destroy the rapidity gap and lead to its violation . at partonic level ,",
    "violation of factorization is manifest through the divergent transverse integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : born ] ) at finite @xmath51 . in the following we use the working assumption that all initial state collinear singularities of the impact factors can be consistently absorbed through the conventional redefinition of the parton distribution functions .",
    "we will demonstrate in sec .",
    "[ sec : jet ] that this is actually the case and that the impact factor itself is a well - defined quantity .",

    "@xmath54 coincides with the partonic cross - section in eq .",
