    "recent breakthrough experiments ( schn _ et al . _ 2000 ) have shown that a monolayer of c@xmath0 can be positively field - doped , a goal hardly realized chemically so far ( datars and ummat 1995 ) . in that state , fullerene exhibits a higher resistivity than for negative doping , and becomes superconducting with critical temperatures that can exceed 50  k , about a factor 5 higher than the corresponding negative field - doped state .",
    "the general belief is that superconductivity in the fullerenes is related to a strong intra - molecular electron - phonon coupling , connected with the jahn - teller effect of the isolated ion ( antropov _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) . unlike the negative doping case , where both calculations ( antropov _ et al .",

    "_ 1991 , lannoo _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) and fits to data ( gunnarsson _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) exist , no quantitative evaluation of the actual jahn - teller coupling strengths is so far available for the positive fullerene ions .",
    "in this work we undertake the task of determining the electron - vibration linear couplings for the @xmath4 homo level of the c@xmath0 molecule , along with that of spelling out some of the consequences for resistivity and for superconductivity . for that purpose",
    "we use density functional electronic structure calculations , yielding accurate molecular vibration frequencies and eigenvectors for the two @xmath1 , six @xmath2 , and eight @xmath3 modes that couple linearly to the electronic @xmath4 state . knowing the form of the jahn - teller coupling matrices",
    ", we distort the molecule and extract the coupling constants from the calculated level shifts and splittings . as a parallel check",
    ", we repeat a similar calculation for the negative , electron doping case , where the @xmath1 and @xmath3 modes couple linearly to the @xmath8 lumo level of the c@xmath0 molecule .",
    "the couplings obtained for negatively doped c@xmath0 are rather similar to those that can be found in the literature , and just represent a fresher , state - of - the - art theoretical determination .",
    "the hole - vibration couplings of positively doped c@xmath0 are new , and can be put to use in a variety of manners , including predicting or explaining properties of molecular ions , such as photoemission ( brhwiler _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) and ir / raman spectra . that is a task that we propose to consider in the near future .",
    "the couplings obtained can also be used to determine the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath7 relevant for the superconductivity as well as for the vibron contribution to the high temperature @xmath9-linear resistivity in the crystalline phase . comparing values for positive and negative doping",
    "we find that for positive doping @xmath7 is a factor 1.4 larger than for negative doping .",
    "these results provide a starting point for a discussion and comparison with the experimental findings .",

    "for ease of comparison , it is therefore useful to set up explicitly the conventions we use in the present calculation .",
    "the analogies of the icosahedral @xmath10 jt coupling to a spherical @xmath11 model were exploited in earlier work , where among other things it was shown that surprisingly , and depending on numbers , this dynamical jt problem may or may not possess a berry phase ( de los rios _ et al .",

    "the representations @xmath12 of @xmath13 map into representations of the icosahedral group @xmath14 as follows ( altmann and herzig 1994 ) : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and so on .",
    "this means that the decomposition of the symmetric part of the tensor product @xmath20 becomes in icosahedral language @xmath21 @xmath1 and @xmath2 appear only once , while the @xmath3 representation modes appears twice in this decomposition : one represents a genuine quadrupolar @xmath22 state , while the other one derives from a @xmath23 representation . though this @xmath13 picture is suggestive ( ceulemans _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) , clearly a quantitative description of c@xmath24 ions had better involve icosahedral symmetry from the beginning .    in the icosahedral group",
    "indeed in the @xmath25 tensor product , the @xmath3 representation appears twice .",
    "this reflects the _ non - simple reducibility _ of the icosahedral symmetry group .",
    "accordingly , butler 1981 provides two independent sets of clebsch - gordan ( cg ) coefficients @xmath26}\\ ; \\equiv\\ ; \\langle h,\\mu;h,\\nu|h , m\\rangle^{[r]}\\ ] ] which couple an @xmath27 electronic state ( quadratically ) with an @xmath28 vibrational mode ( linearly ) to give a scalar .",
    "each set of coefficients is identified by a multiplicity index @xmath29 .",
    "since the two @xmath28 states labeled @xmath29 are symmetry - wise indistinguishable , the choice of these two sets of coefficients is perfectly arbitrary , as long as they are kept orthogonal to each other .",
    "this arbitrariness is the source of the different notations taken in the literature of this field . here",
    ", we stick to butler s choice ( butler 1981 ) , which is basically equivalent to ceulemans convention ( fowler and ceulemans 1985 ) .",

    "the @xmath42-dependence of these cg coefficients indicates that  unlike , for example , cubic symmetry  belonging to the @xmath3 group representation in icosahedral symmetry does not determine completely the form of the jt coupling .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath42 is also needed for that . in the present case of fullerene , each @xmath3 distortion mode is thus characterized not only by its frequency and scalar coupling , but also by its specific mixing angle @xmath50 .",
    "the basic linear jahn - teller hamiltonian for the @xmath51 model is conveniently divided into : @xmath52\\;. \\label{hamiltonian1mode}\\ ] ] the first term describes the linearly - coupled vibrations in the harmonic approximation , @xmath53 while the second term is the linear coupling to each mode : @xmath54 here , of course , the @xmath42 dependence is relevant only for the @xmath55 case .",
    "the distortion coordinates @xmath56 ( with conjugate momentum @xmath57 ) are dimensionless , being measured in units of @xmath58 .",
    "the operator @xmath59 creates an electron in orbital @xmath60 of the homo @xmath4 shell .",
    "naturally this form of the coupling hamiltonian is such that each term represents pertinent irreducible representation combinations that are totally symmetrical , i.e. , scalars , under the icosahedral group . for future applications",
    ", it will provide a convenient form both for perturbative calculations ( small @xmath61 values ) and as a starting point for numerical diagonalization methods , such as the lanczos technique . here , however , we restrict ourselves to a study of the classical molecular distortions . for that , it is more convenient ( manini and de los rios 2000 ) to switch to a _ real representation _ of the vibrational degrees of freedom and orbitals .    to that end",
    ", we apply two standard unitary transformations ( manini and de los rios 2000 ) , one to the electronic and the other to the vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "we define a new set of electronic operators , @xmath62 ( and consequently their hermitian conjugates @xmath63 ) , as @xmath64 this transformation leaves unchanged the ( diagonal ) coupling to the @xmath1 modes , which takes the final form : @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the second ( similar ) transformation is applied to the vibrational coordinates of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes : @xmath68 the harmonic part is left unchanged by this transformation , while the interaction is transformed into @xmath69 the @xmath70 coupling matrices @xmath71 are combinations of the cg coefficients .",
    "their explicit expressions [ we use the shorthand @xmath72 for @xmath73 and omit the explicit indication of dependence @xmath74 are the following : @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78    @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83    in the static jt effect , the kinetic term in @xmath84 is ignored , and the problem is to study the five born - oppenheimer ( bo ) potential sheets given by the sum of each eigenvalue of the electronic problem plus the harmonic restoring forces .",
    "the @xmath85 part has a purely diagonal coupling matrix .",
    "as it does not split the electronic degeneracy , it is trivially separated from the coupling to the other modes and can be treated as a displaced oscillator .",

    "however , the @xmath38 component ( @xmath93 terms in @xmath90 ) of the coupling favours the six classical stable minima of local @xmath5 symmetry ( ceulemans and fowler 1990 , manini and de los rios 2000 ) . the optimal distortion at these minima is @xmath94 , for an energy lowering of @xmath95",
    ".    the simultaneous linear coupling to several modes will generally lead to a cumulative distortion and to an energy gain which is the sum of the individual energy gains .",
    "however , the form of the coupling ( [ real interaction hamiltonian ] ) prevents the molecule to gain energy through both kinds of couplings .",
    "the system shall choose between a @xmath86 and a @xmath5 distortion , depending which one is energetically more convenient for given specific values of the couplings , vibration frequencies , and @xmath4 orbital electronic filling .",

    "the conventional supercell side is @xmath96   , so that the distance between the centers of two neighboring copies of the molecule is 13.1   , suitably much larger than the fully relaxed equilibrium ( opposite c - c ) ball diameter , about 7.053   . since we aim at describing the single molecule  and indeed our molecules are well isolated ",
    "no sampling of the brillouin zone is called for , and calculations of the charge density are done using the @xmath97=0 wavefunctions .",

    "this seems of the correct order of magnitude , although somewhat on the low side , in comparison with @xmath193= 52 k found experimentally .",
    "however , it is difficult to justify weak coupling in this case .    the corresponding value @xmath194 which we obtain for electrons in the @xmath8 orbitals is , assuming the same bandwidth of 0.6  ev , thus again @xmath195  states  ev@xmath183 per band per spin for the @xmath8 band , @xmath196 .",

    "they , first of all , indicate a nonlinear temperature dependence , closer to @xmath201 ; secondly , they show values about 5 times larger for holes than for electrons .",
    "while there are second order processes ( see appendix ) that would indeed yield a @xmath201 resistivity at low temperatures , we do not believe that they may explain the discrepancy here .",
    "zettl and coworkers ( vareka and zettl 1994 ) proposed that the apparent @xmath201 in the electron resistivity is an effect of thermal expansion , and showed that a linear @xmath9 increase is recovered at constant volume , for negative doping .",

    "these data support the view that the @xmath201 resistivity is directly related with a @xmath202 decrease of relaxation time , most likely linked with lattice expansion .",
    "it seems plausible that a similar physics could apply to holes too , in which case the predicted constant - pressure relaxation - time drop with temperature would also be non - linear , and quantitatively larger than the electron case . if , on the other hand , it became possible to obtain the constant - volume inverse relaxation time and resistivity , then , assuming the same plasma frequency @xmath203 , its increase should be linear with @xmath9 with a slope 1.4 times larger than that of negatively - charged c@xmath0 .",

    "within fermi s golden rule , the vibron contribution to the electrical resistivity is exponentially decreasing if temperature is much smaller than the vibron frequencies . however , the above result is not true any more if higher order corrections are taken into account .",
    "indeed , at second order , the electron - vibron coupling generates an effective electron - electron interaction . since the electrons involved lie on a shell of width @xmath9 around the fermi energy , the vibron - originated electron - electron interaction @xmath204 acts as if it were effectively unretarded , @xmath205 .",
