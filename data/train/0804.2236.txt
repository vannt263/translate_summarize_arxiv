    "for over two decades , scaling of fracture surfaces has been a well studied , yet a controversial issue @xcite .",
    "experiments on several materials under different loading conditions have shown that the fracture surface is self - affine @xcite , which implies that if the in plane length scales of a fracture surface are scaled by a factor @xmath6 then the out of plane length scales ( height ) of the fracture surface scales by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the roughness exponent .",
    "many experiments on several materials including metals @xcite , glass @xcite , rocks @xcite and ceramics @xcite have tested the scaling in three dimensions . the scaling regime in some cases has been quite impressive , spanning five decades in metallic alloys @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting question as to whether the self - affinity measured so often can be replaced by more complicated scenarios and whether in any particular setup and geometry the exponents are universal as in the line - depinning scenario @xcite .    in two dimensions ,",
    "recent studies have debated the picture of simple self - affinity . in other words , for a two - dimensional crack profile @xmath9 one can look at various statistical measures including the dependence of the roughness on sample / system size and the scaling of various moments of @xmath9 .",
    "there is a discussion on whether the two - dimensional fracture surfaces would exhibit self - affine or multi - affine scaling @xcite .",
    "@xcite argues that a crack line @xmath9 in two - dimensions is not self - affine ; instead , it exhibits a much complicated multi - affine ( or multiscaling ) structure , with a non - constant scaling exponent @xmath10 for the @xmath11-th order correlation function @xmath12 . in analogy to kinetic roughening of surfaces , it has been argued that fracture surfaces exhibit anomalous scaling @xcite : the _ global _ exponent describing the scaling of the crack width with the sample size is larger than the local exponent measured on a single sample @xcite .",
    "this means that the typical slope of @xmath9 develops an algebraic dependence on the system size @xmath13 , and it is necessary to introduce two roughness exponents a global one ( @xmath8 ) and a local one ( @xmath14 ) whose difference measures the @xmath13-dependent extra lengthscale .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the available experimental results , mainly obtained for paper samples , indicate a roughness exponent in the range @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "however , one should note that apparently one can measure for various ordinary , industrial papers values that are significantly higher than @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the reasons for these discrepancies are not clear .",
    "it has also been noted that the roughness exponent is dependent on the crack velocity : at the onset of fast crack propagation the exponent makes a small jump from its value when the crack still grows in a stable fashion @xcite .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the origin and universality of crack surface roughness is often investigated by discrete lattice ( fuse , central - force , and beam ) models . in these models the elastic medium is described by a network of discrete elements such as fuses , springs and beams with random failure thresholds . in the simplest approximation of a scalar displacement , one recovers the random fuse model ( rfm ) where a lattice of fuses with random threshold are subject to an increasing external voltage @xcite . using two - dimensional rfm , the estimated crack surface roughness exponents are : @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "recently , using large system sizes ( up to @xmath20 ) with extensive sample averaging , we found that the crack roughness exhibits anomalous scaling @xcite .",
    "the local and global roughness exponents estimated using two different lattice topologies are : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "anomalous scaling has been noted in the 3d numerical simulations as well @xcite .",
    "the origins of anomalous scaling of fracture surfaces is not yet clear although recent studies @xcite suggest that the origin of multiscaling and anomalous scaling in numerical simulations may be due to the existence of overhangs ( jumps ) in the crack profile .    in this paper",
    ", we further quantify the influence of these overhangs in the crack profiles on multi - affine scaling and anomalous scaling of crack roughness exponents .",
    "in particular , the questions we would like to address in this article are the following : ( i ) whether anomalous scaling of roughness observed in numerical simulations is a result of these overhangs ( or jumps ) in the crack profiles , and ( ii ) whether removing the jumps in the crack profiles completely eliminates multiscaling .",
    "this should then imply a constant scaling exponent @xmath14 such that the @xmath11-th order correlation function @xmath23 .",
    "it should be noted that gaussian distribution for @xmath24 has been noted in refs .",
    "@xcite only above a characteristic scale where self - affine scaling of crack surfaces is observed . in this study",
    ", we would like to further investigate whether removing these jumps in the crack profiles extends the validity of gaussian probability density distribution @xmath0 of the height differences @xmath1 $ ] of the crack profile to even smaller window sizes @xmath3 .",
    "we also discuss the cases of open ( obc ) and periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , since the presence of the former might have an effect on whether `` anomalous scaling '' exists . for the pbc case , we show that the crack profiles can be collapsed to a `` semi - circle law '' , a scaling ansatz followed by many stochastic processes that return to the origin @xcite .",
    "the rest of the article consists of three sections : first we introduce the numerical details . in section",
    "iii , we go through all the numerical results , and finally section iv presents the conclusions .",
    "we consider numerical simulations using two - dimensional random fuse model ( rfm ) , where a lattice of fuses with random threshold are subject to an increasing external voltage @xcite .",
    "the lattice system we consider is a triangular lattice of linear size @xmath13 with a central notch of length @xmath25 ( unnotched specimens imply @xmath26 ) .",
    "all of the lattice bonds have the same conductance , but the bond breaking thresholds , @xmath27 , are randomly distributed based on a thresholds probability distribution , @xmath28 .",
    "the burning of a fuse occurs irreversibly , whenever the electrical current in the fuse exceeds the breaking threshold current value , @xmath27 , of the fuse .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the horizontal directions ( @xmath29 direction ) to simulate an infinite system and a constant voltage difference , @xmath30 , is applied between the top and the bottom of the lattice system bus bars .",
    "a power - law thresholds distribution @xmath28 is used by assigning @xmath31 , where @xmath32 $ ] is a uniform random variable with density @xmath33 and @xmath34 represents a quantitative measure of disorder .",
    "the larger @xmath34 is , the stronger the disorder .",
    "this results in @xmath27 values between 0 and 1 , with a cumulative distribution @xmath35 .",
    "the average breaking threshold is @xmath36 , and the probability that a fuse will have breaking threshold less than the average breaking threshold @xmath37 is @xmath38 .",
    "that is , the larger the @xmath34 is , the smaller the average breaking threshold and the larger the probability that a randomly chosen bond will have breaking threshold smaller than the average breaking threshold .",
    "numerically , a unit voltage difference , @xmath39 , is set between the bus bars ( in the @xmath40 direction ) and the kirchhoff equations are solved to determine the current flowing in each of the fuses .",
    "subsequently , for each fuse @xmath41 , the ratio between the current @xmath42 and the breaking threshold @xmath43 is evaluated , and the bond @xmath44 having the largest value , @xmath45 , is irreversibly removed ( burnt ) . the current is redistributed instantaneously after a fuse is burnt implying that the current relaxation in the lattice system is much faster than the breaking of a fuse .",
    "each time a fuse is burnt , it is necessary to re - calculate the current redistribution in the lattice to determine the subsequent breaking of a bond .",
    "the process of breaking of a bond , one at a time , is repeated until the lattice system falls apart .    using the algorithm proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have performed numerical simulation of fracture up to system sizes @xmath46 for unnotched samples and up to @xmath47 for notched samples .",
    "our simulations cover an extensive parametric space of ( @xmath13 , @xmath34 and @xmath25 ) given by : @xmath48 ; @xmath49 ; and @xmath50 .",
    "a minimum of 200 realizations have been performed for each case , but for many cases 2000 realizations have been used to reduce the statistical error .",
    "once the sample has failed , we identify the final crack , which typically displays dangling ends and overhangs ( see fig . [",
    "fig : crack ] ) .",
    "we remove them and obtain a single valued crack line @xmath51 , where the values of @xmath52 $ ] . for self - affine cracks , the local width , @xmath53 , where the sums are restricted to regions of length @xmath54 and",

    "in particular , the local width scales as @xmath61 , so that the global roughness @xmath62 scales as @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",

    "in summary , we have here considered the nature of the roughness of the crack surfaces in the two - dimensional rfm . the results presented here indicate universality of local roughness exponent for both notched and unnotched samples with different disorders @xmath34 in the range @xmath144 and for different relative crack sizes @xmath95 .",
    "this is true both for open and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the results indicate that anomalous scaling of roughness is a generic feature of two - dimensional fracture in the fuse model .",
    "this is in contrast to e.g. the beam model @xcite , where the global and local exponents are equal .",
    "the difference of the global and local exponents arises due to an additional lengthscale , which scales as a power - law of the system size @xmath13 .",
    "we further investigated whether anomalous scaling of roughness is an artifact of presence of large jumps in the tails of @xmath24 distribution . to do this",
    ", we considered the @xmath78 data that is only within @xmath145 range of mean of @xmath24 distribution , and computed the corresponding @xmath77 for various window sizes @xmath3 .",
    "however , the data even from these truncated @xmath24 distributions showed anomalous scaling .",
    "we repeated our investigation with @xmath146 range as well , but with a similar result .",
    "this indicates that anomalous scaling of roughness is not due to the tails of @xmath24 distribution and persists in the mean as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "our results provide a concrete proof that the apparent multi - scaling of crack profiles observed in ref .",
    "@xcite is an artifact of jumps in the crack profiles that are formed due to the solid - on - solid approximation used in extracting the crack profiles .",
    "the removal of these jumps from the crack profiles completely eliminates this apparent multi - scaling of crack profiles .",
    "furthermore , removing these jumps in the crack profiles extends the validity of gaussian probability density distribution @xmath0 of the height differences to even smaller window sizes @xmath3 and to a range ( of @xmath147 ) well beyond that observed in earlier studies .    in conclusion",
    ", though the rfm is a `` toy model '' of ( two - dimensional here ) fracture , it still poses interesting issues and can be used to study questions that are also relevant for experiments .",
    "our numerical results presented here raise three basic theoretical questions related to the morphology of two - dimensional rfm fracture surfaces that still remain to be answered .",
    "first , why does the extra lengthscale that leads to anomalous scaling have to be algebraic ?",
    "second , models explaining the dynamics in the final avalanche ( unstable crack propagation ) and the roughness exponent values would be theoretically interesting to develop .",
    "third , how strong is the universality of the roughness exponents for disorders very different from the ones used here , in particular , to those leading to percolative damage or finite densities of infinitely strong fuses ? finally , in addition to presenting results that explain the origins of apparent multiscaling and anomalous scaling , we have also made a connection between periodic fracture surfaces and excursions of stochastic processes .",
