    "the distribution of ch@xmath2oh , hnco , and sio can give insights into both the chemical and physical conditions present in the shocked gas and potentially tell us about nature of the shocks themselves .",
    "below we discuss the overall structure of the shock tracers in the context of nuclear bar models , then we analyze the subtle differences between each shock tracer to further constrain shock properties .      in maffei 2 the outer bar arms",
    "dominate the overall distribution of the shock tracers ch@xmath2oh , hnco , and sio , whereas emission from the star forming ring is minimal .",
    "this is very different from the morphology of co , hcn and the pdr tracers .",
    "the bar ends are especially bright in the shock tracers .",
    "( the faintness of shock tracers along the northern arm is presumably due to the fact that there is much less molecular gas there , particularly at what would be the location of the northern bar end . )",
    "it is perhaps surprising that it is the bar ends and not the inner arms that have the largest fraction of the gas influenced by shocks .",
    "this provides constraints on the nature of gas flows in maffei 2 .",
    "different models exist for describing the structure of gas bars , each predicting different shock strengths and locations .",
    "the models fall into two broad classes , orbit - crowding models and hydrodynamical flows .",
    "orbit - crowding models treat the gas as distinct clouds orbiting on essentially ballistic orbits set up by the potential ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the arm morphology of the bar is then determined by where orbits converge . in hydrodynamical models",
    "the gas is treated as a fluid that responds to the stellar potential and is susceptible to hydrodynamical forces such as pressure and viscosity . in such models , gas flows along streamlines with shocks occurring where the streamlines collide ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both models predict similar morphological distributions but rather distinct shock properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in orbit - crowding models",
    "the bar arms result from molecular clouds moving along converging orbits . in such models",
    "only weak shocks are expected because the bulk of the velocities are parallel to both clouds ( with the possible exception of arm / nuclear ring intersections ) .",
    "moreover such models do not isolate the bar ends as locations of strongly convergent orbits and so it is not expected that these location would be sites of vigorous shock activity .",
    "hydrodynamical models , on the other hand , show gas flow streamlines that change directions dramatically .",
    "the places where flows converge are accompanied by strong changes in velocity , and hence strong shocks . in hydro models ,",
    "gas drifts slowly inward along bar - aligned @xmath114 stellar orbits ( or in the case of maffei 2 , from radial inflow along the outer bar ) until the gas reaches the innermost , cuspy @xmath114 orbit ( of the nuclear bar ) .",
    "the cusps of these orbits lie at the bar ends .",
    "there the gas is compressed , shocks and plunges nearly radially inward along the bar arm until it reaches the much further in , perpendicular to the bar @xmath115 orbitals , where it is again shocked , loses angular momentum and transitions onto the @xmath115 orbitals .",
    "some high angular momentum gas sprays off the inner @xmath115 orbits , swinging out and colliding with the arm gas flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the amount , location and relative velocity of gas in the spray region depends on bar parameters .    _ in summary , the strength of the emission from the shock tracers ch@xmath2oh , hnco , and sio along the bright bar ends favors the hydrodynamical bar models , as orbit - crowding models do not predict strong cloud collisions at the bar end whereas they are sites of shocks in hydrodynamical models . _      what about changes in shock properties across the nuclear bar ?",
    "[ hncoch3oh ] displays the hnco / ch@xmath2oh , sio / ch@xmath2oh and sio / hnco peak temperature ratios smoothed to 8@xmath73 and sampled at the gmcs .",
    "given the significant difference in the native resolution of the three datasets and the fact that they were obtained with two different interferometers , only the clearest trends are discussed .",
    "as demonstrated by the principal component analysis , the morphologies of the three species are strongly correlated , implying that we have a robust measure of the locations of shocked gas .",
    "_ so similar are the maps that only very subtle differences between hnco , ch@xmath2oh and sio appear , suggesting that shock conditions are uniform across the nucleus . _ with the possible exception of the uncertain sio ratios towards gmc b , the arm clouds ( c , d , f , g ) have effectively constant hnco / ch@xmath2oh ( @xmath116 ) , sio / ch@xmath2oh ( @xmath117 ) and sio / hnco ( @xmath118 ) ratios . only towards gmc e and the off arm spray regions ( gmc h and just south of the western ring ) are different ratios observed . towards gmc e ( the northern star forming region ) , hnco / ch@xmath2oh is lower and the sio ratios are higher relative to the rest of the arm . in the off arm regions hnco / ch@xmath2oh ratios",
    "are depressed while the sio / ch@xmath2oh ratio is elevated and sio / hnco are elevated ( spray region ) or flat ( gmc h ) .    from these ratios ,",
    "three main points are concluded .",
    "1 ) while gmc g ( the bar end ) is the brightest source in the nuclear bar , indicating that the largest fraction of gas along this line of sight is shocked , evidently shock strengths are not enhanced here .",
    "sio to mantle species have the same basic ratio at the bar end as it has over the rest of the bar .",
    "\\2 ) towards gmc e , the decreased intensity of hnco relative to ch@xmath2oh and sio is consistent with what is expected from photodissociation . from section [ pdr ] , we know that the dense gas here is permeated by uv photons for the young star formation . the shock tracer ratios further confirm this .",
    "because of this , the absence ( or faintness ) of shock tracers towards the central ring and in particular the northern @xmath76 orbit intersection can not be taken as evidence of absence of shocks here .",
    "\\3 ) the spray region upstream ( counterclockwise ) from the main bar arms favor ch@xmath2oh and to a lesser degree sio relative to hnco .",
    "it is possible that because gas is more diffuse in this region grain mantles are h - richer than in the denser arm .",
    "however , we favor a simpler explanation associated with changing excitation .",
    "the spray regions have lower density hence the higher critical density hnco transition is expected to be weaker relative to the lower critical density , ch@xmath2oh and sio transitions . that the @xmath72 transition of hnco preferentially favors the dense clouds relative to more extended ch@xmath2oh explains why larger beam single - dish multi - line observations derive an excitation temperature for hnco that is nearly a factor of @xmath119 larger than derived for the ch@xmath2oh transitions in maffei 2 @xcite .",
    "note that the excitation temperature of both species is quite low ( t@xmath37 @xmath12015 k ) , implying that the shock regions remain cool or the densities are low enough for these transitions to be sub - thermal .",
    "_ in summary , we conclude that there is little evidence for strongly varying grain chemistry across the shocked regions on 8@xmath73 scales .",
    "the small level of variation seen is consistent with changing physical conditions ( radiation field and gas density ) . _",
    "the overall nuclear structures of maffei 2 and ic 342 are similar .",
    "both have extended bar - like arms that terminate on a central ring that is actively forming stars .",
    "the molecular gas morphology of ic 342 is consistent with that of a gaseous bar @xcite .",
    "however , because of the very small central ring and ambiguous kinematics , other conclusions including unbarred spiral arms coupled with massive star feedback remain feasible @xcite . on",
    "the other hand maffei 2 is clearly a nuclear bar based on both its morphology and kinematics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the potential dynamical similarities of the two nuclei a comparison of the chemistry of the two can provide important insights on the generalizability of the the overall chemical picture developed in @xcite .",
    "the statistically robust principal component analysis demonstrates that the chemistry of the two nuclei are remarkably consistent .",
    "maffei 2 can be defined chemically as a highly inclined copy of ic  342 ( fig .",
    "[ fgenchem ] ) . in both systems",
    "the first principal component characterizes the density - weighted column density , and peaks along the inner arms and central ring .",
    "the second principal component separates the main chemical forces responsible for controlling observed abundances , namely shocks versus pdrs .",
    "pdr species dominate close to the young star forming region while the shock tracers peak along the arm , with preference for the cuspy bar ends . as a result ,",
    "the bar driven star formation / chemical scenario outlined in @xcite must apply also to maffei 2 s nuclear bar .",
    "however the chemical picture is not precisely identical , and these differences give added insight into the relative differences in evolutionary phase of the two nuclei .",
    "the main difference between the two galaxies is in the distribution of n@xmath3h@xmath1 . in ic  342",
    "the pdr tracers are confined , appearing to be primarily cloud surface features , lining the inner ring .",
    "significant n@xmath3h@xmath1 ( and hnco ) seen near the young star forming region in ic  342 implies that its main star forming region influences the dense gas only locally , on scales of 50 pc or less . _",
    "whereas in maffei 2 , the n@xmath3h@xmath1/hco@xmath1 ratio and photodissociation of hnco clearly demonstrate that the star formation has begun to dramatically alter the chemical state of the dense molecular clouds in its immediate environment , not just the surfaces .",
    "_    evidently the central molecular ring in maffei 2 is structurally different ( lower clump density ) and that towards gmc e star formation is somewhat more evolved than the main burst in ic 342 .",
    "this is consistent with the steeper radio spectrum towards gmc e @xcite .",
    "the crude estimates of timescale required to alter the chemistry of the dense component is @xmath4 7 myrs .",
    "this is a reasonable timescale compared to stellar evolution of the burst in maffei 2 and the kinematics of the outflow .",
    "however , this timescale is still very short ; short enough that even this evolved part of the burst is in its early stages .",
    "the star formation extending to the north and south of gmc e is likely as young as the embedded star formation in ic 342 .    in ic  342",
    "the peak temperature ratios between sio , ch@xmath2oh and hnco , are similar to those seen in maffei  2 .",
    "the pdr gmc in ic  342 has slightly lower hnco / ch@xmath2oh and elevated sio / hnco ratios .",
    "this is exactly the behavior exhibited by the pdr - modified gmc e in maffei 2 , lending strong support for the influence of photodissociation on shock tracer brightness .",
    "the shock chemistry dominated cloud in ic 342 has slightly elevated hnco relative to the other species , making its set of ratios a match within the uncertainties of gmc g. this agreement suggests that both the grain composition and shock properties are the same for these structurally similar locales .",
    "however , since brightnesses are sensitive to radiative transfer effects , one must be careful over - interpreting ratios if gas excitation is changing rapidly .",
    "maffei 2 and ic 342 do have rather similar co excitation conditions @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we find that when the dynamical environments are similar , as they are in ic  342 and maffei  2 , a consistent chemical picture begins to emerge .",
    "gas chemistry is confirmed as a powerful method for isolating the physical mechanisms that influence gas conditions in spiral nuclei . in future papers in this series",
    ", we will broaden the range of galactic environments studied to assess how far chemistry can be pushed as a diagnostic of sub - beam physics .",
    "this paper presents 2@xmath0 - 10@xmath0 imaging of transitions from nine separate molecules across the nuclear bar in maffei 2 obtained with the bima and ovro millimeter interferometers .",
    "the results are compared with the first paper in the series on ic 342 to test the generalizability of the chemistry discovered there and to constrain differences in structure between the two nuclei .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "morphologies of the observed transitions exhibit both dramatic ( e.g. , c@xmath3h vs. ch@xmath2oh ) and subtle ( e.g. , hcn vs. hco@xmath1 ) spatial differences indicative of the varying dominance of shocks vs. radiation fields as drivers of the chemistry in individual clouds .",
    "a principal component analysis reveals that hcn , hnc , hco@xmath1 and 3 mm continuum are all extremely tightly correlated , indicating a direct connection to massive star formation .",
    "ch@xmath2oh and hnco are tightly correlated with each other and are strongly anti - correlated with the tracers of massive star formation ; based on their spatial distribution , it appears that these two molecules are formed by liberation of grain mantles in the presence of bar shocks .",
    "4 .   variations in the ratios amongst the popular @xmath121 3 mm dense gas tracers , hcn , hco@xmath1 , hnc , cs and hc@xmath2n , are at or less than a factor of three , unlike the order of magnitude variations exhibited by the chemistry - sensitive molecules .",
    "this indicates that variations in excitation in the cool , dense gas are much less dramatic than variations in dense gas chemical conditions .",
    "localized variations in the ratios hcn / hco@xmath1 , hcn / hnc , hcn / cs and hcn / co can be explained by variations in density .",
    "the dense gas ratios indicate that the highest density gas is found at the @xmath76 orbit intersections , the lowest density gas is along the non star - forming western portion of the ring , and intermediate density gas is found near the star formation .",
    "although high density gas is found throughout the full extent of the nuclear bar arms , the dense gas fraction falls at larger radii from the nucleus . 6 .",
    "there is no evidence for x - ray dissociation regions or agn influences on the gas in the center of maffei  2 , specifically , as traced by the hcn / hco@xmath1 ratio .",
    "the strong correlation between high hco@xmath1/n@xmath3h@xmath1 ratios and the pdr tracer molecule , c@xmath3h , suggests that this ratio may be a powerful new probe of dense pdrs in external galaxies .",
    "given the high critical density of both hco@xmath1 and n@xmath3h@xmath1 in comparison to c@xmath3h , the elevated ratio demonstrates that pdr gas towards the strong star forming regions permeate the dense clumps .",
    "when combined with the morphology of c@xmath3h this ratio may provide useful insights into the relative density of pdr gas .",
    "c@xmath3h emission reveals a molecular outflow along the minor axis that has entrained molecular gas .",
    "wrapped around the outside of this outflow is ionized gas traced in 2 cm radio continuum . assuming ballistic motion , the morphology and kinematics are consistent with a very young age of 6 - 7 myrs for the outflow .",
    "the bar induced orbital shocks in maffei 2 are traced in three species , hnco , ch@xmath2oh and sio .",
    "all three species support the conclusion that the nuclear bar end is the site of the largest fraction of shocked gas .",
    "that this location exhibits such strong shock properties argues in favor of hydrodynamical bar models .",
