    "in the last several years integrable hierarchies of non - linear differential equations in @xmath5 dimensions have been intensely explored , mainly in connection with the discretization of the two - dimensional gravity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "supersymmetric extensions of such equations have also been largely investigated @xcite-@xcite using a variety of different methods . unlike the bosonic theory ,",
    "many questions have not yet been answered in the supersymmetric case . in this talk",
    "i report a recent result , obtained in collaboration with h.l .",
    "carrion and m. rojas @xcite , concerning the formulation of the @xmath6-extended supersymmetric versions of the bosonic integrable equations ( for @xmath3 ) in terms of the division algebras @xmath0 , @xmath1 , * h*@xmath7 respectively .    to be precise we focused our investigation on the supersymmetric extensions of kdv . at first the standard results of mathieu @xcite concerning @xmath8 kdv",
    "are reviewed in the language of division algebras , while a full analysis of the global @xmath9 extensions of kdv is performed .",
    "the delduc and ivanov @xcite result is recovered as a special case .",
    "later it is proven that a unique @xmath4 hamiltonian extension of kdv can be found .",
    "it admits as a poisson brackets structure the so - called  non - associative @xmath4 superconformal algebra \" introduced for the first time in @xcite .",
    "it is quite a special superconformal algebra , since it does not satisfy the jacobi property ( this is why it was named  non - associative \" ) . in order to have an @xmath4 kdv , the  non - associativity \" of the underlining superconformal algebra of poisson brackets",
    "is mandatory .",
    "this is due to the fact that no central extension , which is responsible for the inhomogeneous character of kdv , is allowed by jacobian superconformal algebras .",
    "it is worth noticing that in the following the problem of the integrability of the hamiltonian super - kdvs system is not addressed , only the issue of their global supersymmetric invariances is of concern here .",
    "the @xmath6-extended superconformal algebras , for @xmath3 , can be recovered from division algebras .",
    "let us here present the largest of such conformal algebras , the",
    " @xmath4 non - associative sca \" of reference @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 sca s are recovered as subalgebras .",
    "the  @xmath4 non - associative sca \" can be defined via octonionic structure constants .",
    "a generic octonion @xmath11 is expressed as @xmath12 ( throughout the text the convention over repeated indices is understood ) , where @xmath13 are real numbers while @xmath14 denote the basic octonions , with @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the identity , while @xmath17 , for @xmath18 , denote the imaginary octonions . in the following a greek index",
    "is employed for imaginary octonions , a latin index for the whole set of octonions ( identity included ) .",
    "the octonionic multiplication can be introduced through @xmath19 with @xmath20 a set of totally antisymmetric structure constants which , without loss of generality , can be taken to be @xmath21 and vanishing otherwise .",
    "when @xmath22 are restricted to , let s say , the values @xmath23 we recover the quaternionic subalgebra , which is associative .",
    "the @xmath4 extension of the virasoro algebra is constructed in terms of the above structure constants .",
    "besides the spin-@xmath24 virasoro field , it contains eight fermionic spin-@xmath25 fields @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 spin-@xmath29 bosonic currents @xmath30",
    ". it is explicitly given by the following poisson brackets @xmath31 this superconformal algebra can be recovered via sugawara construction of the affine octonionic algebra ( see @xcite for details ) . the failure in closing",
    "the jacobi identity is in consequence of the non - associativity of the multiplication between octonions .",
    "a natural question to be raised is whether the ( [ topp - eq3 ] ) sca ( and its superconformal subalgebras ) can be regarded as a poisson brackets structure for a supersymmetric hamiltonian extension of kdv .",
    "this amounts to determine the most general globally supersymmetric hamiltonian of a given dimension @xmath32 ( i.e. the second hamiltonian ) . in the case of @xmath8 , this result",
    "is known since the works of mathieu @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the extension to the @xmath9 case has been completely worked out .",
    "the moduli space of inequivalent @xmath9 kdv equations has been classified .",
    "the special integrable point of delduc - ivanov @xcite has been recovered in this framework . the complete solution to the @xmath4 case",
    "was given as well .",
    "to get these results an extensive use of computer algebra ( with mathematica and the thielemans package for classical opes computations ) was required .",
    "the final results are presented here .",
    "the most general @xmath9-supersymmetric hamiltonian for the @xmath9 kdv depends on @xmath33 parameters ( plus an overall normalization constant ) .",
    "however , if the hamiltonian is further assumed to be invariant under the involutions of the @xmath9 minimal sca , three of the parameters have to be set equal to @xmath34 .",
    "i recall here that the involutions of the @xmath9 minimal sca are induced by the involutions of the quaternionic algebra .",
    "three such involutions exist ( any two of them can be assumed as generators ) , the @xmath35-th one ( for @xmath36 ) is given by leaving @xmath17 ( together with the identity ) invariant and flipping the sign of the two remaining @xmath37 s .",
    "what is left is the most general hamiltonian , invariant under @xmath9 and the involutions of the algebra .",
    "it is given by @xmath38 here @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath9 global supersymmetry requires the three parameters @xmath13 to satisfy the condition @xmath42 so that only two of them are independent . since any two of them , at will",
    ", can be plotted in a real @xmath43 plane , it can be proven that the fundamental domain of the moduli space of inequivalent @xmath9 kdv equations can be chosen to be the region of the plane comprised between the real axis @xmath44 and the @xmath45 line ( boundaries included ) .",
    "there are five other regions of the plane ( all such regions are related by an @xmath46-group transformation ) which could be equally well chosen as fundamental domain",
    ".    in the region of our choice the @xmath45 line corresponds to an extra global @xmath47-invariance , while the origin , for @xmath48 , is the most symmetric point ( it corresponds to a global @xmath49 invariance associated to the generators @xmath50 ) .",
    "the involutions associated to each given imaginary quaternion allows to consistently reduce the @xmath9 kdv equation to an @xmath8 kdv , by setting simultaneously equal to @xmath34 all the fields associated with the @xmath37 s which flip the sign , e.g. the fields @xmath51 for the first involution ( and similarly for the other couples of values @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "after such a reduction we recover the @xmath8 kdv equation depending on the free parameter @xmath54 ( or , respectively , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "the integrability is known for @xmath8 kdv to be ensured for three specific values @xmath57 , discovered by mathieu @xcite , of the free parameter @xmath58 .",
    "we are therefore in the position to determine for which points of the fundamental domain the @xmath9 kdv is mapped , after any reduction , to one of the three mathieu s integrable @xmath8 kdvs .",
    "it turns out that in the fundamental domain only two such points exist .",
    "both of them lie on the @xmath45 line .",
    "one of them produces , after inequivalent @xmath8 reductions , the @xmath59 and the @xmath60 @xmath8 kdv hierarchies .",
    "the second point , which produces the @xmath61 and the @xmath59 @xmath8 kdv equations , however , does not admit at the next order an @xmath9 hamiltonian which is in involution w.r.t .",
    "this has been explicitly proven in @xcite .",
    "the treatment of @xcite is more complete than the one in @xcite since it is based on an exhaustive component - fields analysis , rather than on an extended superfield formalism .",
    "the most general equations of motion of the @xmath9 kdv are directly obtained from the hamiltonian ( [ topp - eq4 ] ) together with the ( [ topp - eq3 ] ) poisson brackets .",
    "a similar analysis can be extended to the @xmath4 case based on the full @xmath4 non - associative sca . at first the most general hamiltonian with the right dimension has been written down .",
    "later , some constraints on it have been imposed .",
    "the first set of constraints requires the invariance under all the @xmath28 involutions of the algebra . in the case of octonions",
    "the total number of involutions is @xmath28 ( with @xmath63 generators ) each one being associated to one of the seven combinations appearing in ( [ topp - eq2 ] ) . in the case , e.g. , of the @xmath64 combination the corresponding @xmath17 s are left invariant , while the remaining four @xmath37 s , living in the complement , have the sign flipped .",
    "the second set of constraints requires the invariance under the whole set of @xmath4 global supersymmetries . under this condition",
    "there exists only one hamiltonian , up to the normalization factor , which is @xmath4 invariant .",
    "it does not contain any free parameter and is quadratic in the fields .",
    "it is explicitly given by @xmath65 ( here @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponds to the origin of coordinates ( confront the previous case ) which is also , just like the @xmath9 case , the point of maximal symmetry .",
    "this means that the hamiltonian is invariant under the whole set of seven global charges @xmath68 , obtained by integrating the currents @xmath30 s .    despite its apparent simplicity",
    ", it gives an @xmath4 extension of kdv which does not reduce ( for any @xmath8 reduction ) to the three mathieu s values for integrability .",
    "nevertheless it is a highly non - trivial fact that an @xmath4 extension of the kdv equation indeed exists and that it is unique .",
    "explicitly , the associated equations of motion are given by @xmath69 besides the @xmath4 kdv , the fields entering ( [ topp - eq3 ] ) admit globally @xmath9 supersymmetric invariant hamiltonians , which depend on free parameters .",
    "two such classes of hamiltonians are individuated .",
    "the first class consists of the hamiltonians invariant under supersymmetries related with the quaternionic subalgebra which , without loss of generality , can be assumed to be given by @xmath70 , for @xmath71 . the second class of invariances is associated to the @xmath9 supersymmetries associated to the remaining generators , i.e. those living in the complement ( in the following , without loss of generality , these supersymmetries are labeled by @xmath72 ) .",
    "for completeness we report here the results .",
    "the first class of @xmath9-invariant hamiltonians is given by @xmath73 with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath11 free parameters , while @xmath74 .    in the above expression @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    the second class of @xmath9 invariant hamiltonians is explicitly given by @xmath77 where in this case two free parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath78 , appear .",
    "in this paper i have presented some new results concerning an explicit connection of division algebras and the extended supersymmetrizations of the kdv equation .",
    "in particular it has been proven , following @xcite , the existence of a unique @xmath4 kdv equation of hamiltonian type based on the @xmath4 non - associative sca as a generalized classical poisson brackets structure .",
    "division algebras are a natural ingredient when dealing with extended supersymmetries .",
    "it is therefore likely that supersymmetric extensions of other classes of bosonic integrable equations could be studied with the tools furnished by division algebras . besides kdv ,",
    "the next simplest equations to be investigated are the mkdv and the nls . in view of the results of @xcite , where the @xmath4 non - associative sca is recovered from a singular limit of a sugawara construction based on the superaffine octonionic algebra of supermalcev type",
    ", it is almost for granted that such extensions indeed exist .    whether such constructions could be applied to other classes of integrable equations",
    "is still an open problem . in any case division algebras",
    "look as a promising and elegant tool to unveil some of the mysterious features still surrounding the supersymmetrization of the bosonic hierarchies ."
