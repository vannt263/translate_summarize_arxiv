    "the passage of ions across cell membranes , and within cells , is of fundamental importance in determining the electrophysiological responses of nerve and muscle cells .",
    "such responses are manifested ultimately in the functioning of the nervous and muscular systems , including organs of crucial biological importance such as the heart and brain . in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , key discoveries were made and biophysical theories proposed concerning such ionic currents , for example by nernst ( 1889 ) , planck ( 1890 ) and bernstein ( 1902 ) . with new electrophysiological recording techniques , many advances were made in the 1940 s and 1950 s by , amongst others , in alphabetical order , eccles , hodgkin , huxley and katz - see huxley ( 1959 ) for a summary . in the 1970 s and 1980 s ,",
    "much additional insight was obtained when recordings were made of currents through single ion channels , notably by neher and sakmann ( hamill et al . , 1981 ) . in the last 20 or so years",
    "there has been an enormous number of discoveries concerning the factors which determine ionic current flows in neurons and muscle cells .",
    "the present review concerns modeling aspects of the class of calcium currents called l - type , which , as will be seen below , have many consequences beyond electrophysiology .    for graphic but brief historical accounts of calcium current discoveries see tsien and barrett ( 2005 ) and dolphin ( 2006 ) . according to the former review , _",
    "`` ... it is apparent that channels have reached the forefront of the field of ion channel research ... due to their vital role in cellular signaling , their diversity , and great susceptibility to modulation ... ''_. records of the first single channel recording of currents identified as being l - type were given in ( nowycky et al .",
    "more recent single channel recordings are in cens et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , where a comparison of results for and @xmath7 as charge carrier is shown , and schrder et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , where the much greater magnitude of l - type currents in failing heart are compared with those in normal heart .",
    "the principal motivation for the analysis and quantitative modeling of l - type calcium currents is that they occur in most nerve and muscle cells .",
    "they often play basic roles in pacemaker activity ( see section 5.2 ) and more generally in regulating spike frequency by inducing afterhyperpolarization , as for example in the hippocampus by coupling to sk channels ( tanabe et al.,1998 ) .",
    "wu et al . ( 2008 ) showed that l - type current in ca1 pyramidal cells , by coupling to delayed rectifier potassium channels ( k@xmath87.x ) , can give rise to long - lasting changes in adaptation .",
    "comprehensive models of nerve cells may include spatial variations or not , but in either case the minimum number of current components is at least 10 and amongst these there should or will usually be included several currents .",
    "if they are included in a model , l - type currents require a careful treatment and our aim here is to attempt to summarize several details of their basic properties and modeling which have been employed for many kinds of nerve and muscle cell .",
    "many protein molecules are embedded in the cell membranes of neurons .",
    "some of these molecules are receptors for the main central neurotransmitters glutamate ( excitatory ) and gaba ( inhibitory ) , as well as transmitter / modulators such as noradrenaline , dopamine , and serotonin all of which are released from vesicles in response to signals arriving at synapses where neighboring cells make close contact .",
    "( see for example cooper et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for an introduction to basic neurochemistry and neuropharmacology . ) of particular importance in determining the way in which a neuron behaves in response to electrical and chemical stimuli are other protein molecules which serve as entrance and exit pathways for electrically charged ions .",
    "such molecules are called ion channels .",
    "if an ion channel is relatively more selective for a certain kind of ion , for example , sodium , @xmath9 , then it is called a sodium channel .",
    "the most commonly occurring cation channels in neurons are sodium , potassium and calcium .",
    "such ion channels may be open or closed , which means they may or may not permit the passage of ions through them .",
    "one of the chief consequences of the ionic currents which flow through such channels when they are open is the alteration of the electrical potential difference across the cell membrane . in the resting state , this potential difference is in the approximate range from -80 mv to -50 mv .",
    "an inward flux of positive ions such as @xmath9 or leads to a diminution of the potential difference , called depolarization or excitation , which , if sufficiently strong , may give rise to an action potential or spike .",
    "when the membrane is depolarized , ion channels such as those of undergo conformational changes which lead to their opening for certain time intervals . hence they are called voltage - gated ion channels .      the process of opening the channel is called activation",
    ". however , channels may be in several different states because often there is also a process of inactivation which is not simply the cessation of activation . for a channel to",
    "be conducting , the inactivation component must be switched off and the activation component switched on . if we denote the probability of activation being on by @xmath10 ( for example ) and the probability of inactivation being off as @xmath11 , then table 1 gives the various channel states and their probabilities .",
    "it will be seen that the sum of the probabilities in the third column of the table add to unity , as they must . for more details ,",
