    "we remind that the knowledge of the @xmath1 of asymmetric matter is very important at low densities ( neutron skins , nuclear structure at the drip lines , neutron distillation in fragmentation , neutron star formation and crust .. ) as well as at high densities ( transition to a deconfined phase , neutron star mass / radius , cooling , hybrid structure , formation of black holes ... ) .",
    "we take advantage of recent opportunities in theory ( development of rather reliable microscopic transport codes for @xmath0 ) and in experiments ( availability of very asymmetric radioactive beams , improved possibility of measuring event - by - event correlations ) to present results that could severely constrain the existing effective interaction models",
    ". we will discuss dissipative collisions at intermediate energies , i.e. in the range from @xmath6 up to @xmath7 .",
    "this will allow to probe the symmetry term above normal density .",

    "the dynamical effects of a different density dependence of the isovector part of the @xmath1 are tested @xcite .",
    "moreover a particular attention is devoted to the isospin effects on the momentum dependence of the symmetry potentials , i.e. to observables sensitive to a different neutron / proton effective mass in asymmetric matter .",
    "the problem of momentum dependence in the isovector channel ( @xmath8 ) is still very controversial and it would be extremely important to get more definite experimental information , see the refs .",
    "exotic beams at intermediate energies are of interest in order to have high momentum particles and to test regions of high baryon ( isoscalar ) and isospin ( isovector ) density during the reaction dynamics .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sect.2 the self - consistent transport approach to the reaction dynamics",
    "is shortly described .",
    "sect.3 is devoted to a detailed analysis of the used effective interactions , in particular of the isovector contributions to the local and non - local part of the mean field potentials .",
    "the latter , which corresponds to the @xmath8 case , leads to a splitting of the neutron - proton effective masses in asymmetric matter .",

    "a parametrization of free nucleon - nucleon cross sections is used , with isospin , energy and angular dependence @xcite .",
    "low energy nn collisions , mostly forbidden because of the pauli blocking , have large cross sections and could induce spurious effects in the presence of some numerical inefficiency in the blocking procedure , due to the discretization of the phase space . in order to avoid such problems a cutoff value @xmath10 is used in our calculations .",
    "a parallel ensemble method is employed in the implementation of the collision term .    for discussions of isospin dynamics in this energy regime",

    "a coalescence procedure is applied in an event by event analysis at the `` freeze - out '' time , i.e. when the resulting fragments are well separated in space and interacting only via coulomb forces .",
    "the fragments are formed using a phase - space proximity criterion .",
    "two particles are recognized to belong to the same cluster if they are sufficiently close in phase space .",
    "the procedure is applied to several random samplings of n ( total number of nucleons ) test particles from the full ensemble distribution at the freeze - out .",
    "the used coalescence parameters are @xmath11 , @xmath12 , that reasonably reproduce the charge distributions in the same energy range @xcite .",

    "<S> the effects of the competition between stiffness and momentum dependence of the symmetry potential on the reaction dynamics are thoroughly analyzed . in this way </S>",

    "<S> new , more exclusive , experiments are suggested . </S>"
