    "on @xmath6 july 2013 , we have been reported higgs - like boson at long last . although we do nt know that whether this new boson is the higgs boson or not , we would have found the last piece of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "although the sm of particle physics can predict various experiments very accuracy , there are some problems and unsatisfactory points which have not been solved yet . in this paper",
    ", we would like to focus on the origin of the flavour structure of fermions among these problems .",
    "when we consider to solve this problem , there is no guiding principle at the present . for a long while ,",
    "many scientists have employed discrete flavour symmetries ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) in the neutrino sector and tryed to understand the origin by using the geometric structure .",
    "such symmetries derive tri - bi maximal type mixing @xcite and this mixing have been compatible with the neutrino oscillation data before growth of the reactor experiments @xcite .",
    "these experiments have reported non - zero reactor angle , @xmath5 , at very high confidence level . at this point , we have to reconsider the origin of the flavour structure of fermions .",
    "the symmetry like flavour symmetry should be broken at enough high energy compared with electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "searching for the clue of the guidepost for the flavour structure , it is very important to seek a small parameter in the model . from this point of view",
    ", we show the following candidates as small parameters for examples :    1 .",
    "@xmath7  ( or  @xmath8 ) , 2 .",
    "@xmath9  ( or  @xmath10 ) , 3 .",
    "@xmath11 , 4 .",
    "@xmath12 , 5 .",
    "@xmath13  ( or  @xmath14 ) ,    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for the mixing angles in the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) , @xmath17 , and cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) , @xmath18 , mixing matrices which are the standard parametrization defined by the particle data group @xcite , respectively , and @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote masses of the up - type quarks , down - type quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos . in this paper",
    ", we pay our attentions from ( iii ) to ( v ) and discuss the gifts of these viewpoints .    in the limit of @xmath22 , that is @xmath23",
    ", the @xmath24 flavour symmetry appears in the majorana neutrino mass matrix as @xmath25 if we do not necessary to make unnatural hierarchy between the masses for first two neutrinos and the third one , it can be realized to obtain the degenerated neutrino masses .    , of @xmath26 decay as a function of @xmath27 in the standard @xmath28 framework , where 3@xmath29 constraints of the neutrino oscillation parameters from @xcite are imposed while varying cp phases from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "the current upper bound by combining results from the exo @xcite and kamland - zen @xcite experiments at @xmath32 c.l . and",
    "the expected future bound by the next generation exo and kamland - zen experiments @xcite are also shown .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    such region of neutrino masses ( roughly speaking @xmath33 ) is very attractive from the neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath26 ) decay .",
    "the effective mass of @xmath26 decay can be constrained on the promising region for the next generation experiments for example kamland - zen and exo experiments shown as fig.[fig:0nbb ] .",
    "on the other hand , the mass matrix shown as eq.([eq : o(2 ) ] ) seems to be difficult to apply to the charged fermion sector because their masses are strongly hierarchical .",
    "but one can assume the degenerate mass set to be zero at the leading order , that is , assign the different doublet representation , @xmath34 , or the singlet representation to the right - handed fields .",
    "such assignments lead two types of mass matrix , @xmath35 we can obtain hierarchical mass for third generation in both case . in this sense , the partial degenerate limit might be applicable to not only the charged lepton sector but also the quark sectors .",
    "we can connect the small charged fermion masses with the @xmath24 symmetry breaking . also , we may be able to naturally understand some phenomenological relations among the ckm matrix elements @xcite .",
    "the o(2 ) symmetry breaking triggers flavor mixing at the same time . in the quark and charged lepton sectors , small flavour mixings are expected because the breaking terms are supposed to be much smaller than the leading terms of eq.([eq : charged ] ) , and thus the observed small ckm mixing could be obtained .",
    "we notice that mixing between the first and second generations is not necessarily small because of the mass degeneracy .",
    "this could explain reason why @xmath36 is a little larger than the others .",
    "meanwhile in the neutrino sector , flavor mixing can be large since the leading - order neutrino mass matrix in eq.([eq : o(2 ) ] ) is almost proportional to the unit matrix if the neutrino mass hierarchy is mild .",
    "then , it may be possible to realize the large pmns mixing even thought the breaking terms are suppressed .",
    ".particle contents and charge assignments of the model , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the indices of generations , @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent the left- and right - handed sm leptons , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the sm higgs and gauge singlet scalar fields , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this section , we briefly explain about our model . at the beginning , we summarize the charge assignments of each fields in table.[tab:1 ] .",
    "we adopt the second type of the mass matrix written in eq.([eq : charged ] ) for the charged lepton by assigning the singlet representation into the right - handed charged leptons , @xmath43 , in this analysis .",
    "our model is constructed with respect to @xmath3 flavour symmetry which is discrete subgroup of @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath24 have same multiplication rules .",
    "we introduce a new sm gauge singlet scalar fields , @xmath44 , to break this flavour symmetry .",
    "furthermore , we impose this new scalar fields have complex vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) and denote the cp violating phases as @xmath45 .",
    "the lagrangian under the @xmath3 flavour symmetry is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are dimensionless couplings , @xmath51 describes a breaking scale of the @xmath3 flavor symmetry and we have ignored the next - to - next - to - leading terms in the charged lepton sector .",
    "we note that due to an extra charge of @xmath3 which is described as a subscript in table.[tab:1 ] , we can construct ideal terms with froggatt - nielsen @xcite like mechanism .",
    "furthermore , we adopt the dimension five weinberg operator with an energy scale with a scale , @xmath52 , for the neutrino masses .    for concluding of explanation of our model , we have to note that our model do not need to have any hierarchical couplings to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "@xmath4 tuning between @xmath48 and @xmath53 , however , is necessary in order to realize the large neutrino mixings .",
    "we have checked that our model can reproduce the experimental data by numerical analysis with following parameter spaces : @xmath54 for the case of normal neutrino mass ordering and @xmath55 for the inverted hierarchy case .",
    "actually , we have enough number of parameters to reproduce experimental data shown in figs.[fig : rct - atm ] .",
    "when we determine the specific generation mechanism for the neutrino masses for example introducing the right - handed neutrino or something like that , we may reduce the parameters and construct predictive model .",
    "we study a @xmath3 flavour symmetric model inspired by the smallness of solar neutrino mass square difference comparing with atmospheric one and testability of the @xmath26 decay . in this model",
    ", we introduce a new sm gauge singlet scalar with complex vevs .",
    "this model has a non - trivial feature between electron mass and a mixing angle , @xmath5 , via cp violating phases in these . here",
    ", we assume that @xmath56 with @xmath57 and from this assumption we can rewritten the mass matrix of charged lepton as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we can see that each term is @xmath61 matrix .",
    "the first term is mainly responsible for muon mass and the second one is for electron mass , respectively .",
    "we suppose that @xmath57 so that we can obtain the small electron mass .",
    "furthermore , we need one more assumption . to avoid accidental contribution to @xmath62-@xmath63 mixing from charged lepton mass matrix ,",
    "we assume @xmath64 .",
    "on the other hand , in the basis in which upper - left @xmath65 elements of @xmath66 is diagonalized the @xmath62-@xmath67 element of neutrino mass matrix can similarly be rewritten as @xmath68   2 s_1s_2 ^ 3\\ ,   \\cdots   \\right\\}\\,.\\ ] ] as we can see from this equation , the angle @xmath69 is controlled by the small cp violating parameter @xmath70 .",
    "we can see that our model can reproduce the experimental data with some assumptions but we need to check whether such assumptions are valid or not . to do this , we discuss the possibility of spontaneous cp violation ( scpv ) . at first",
    ", we assume that the singlet scalar fields were completely decoupled from the theory at high energy . in this condition ,",
    "the only to do is to investigate only the potential of the singlet scalar fields .",

    "it is , of course , very interesting and challenging that to construct the model with @xmath24 and take into account new gauge bosons .",
