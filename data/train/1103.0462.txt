    "while the interest in antinucleon physics waned somewhat after 1996 when the low energy anti - proton ring ( lear ) at cern was shut down , this trend has clearly reversed over the last couple of years .",
    "hereby measurements of the antiproton - proton ( @xmath0 ) invariant mass in the decays of @xmath4 , @xmath5 mesons , etc .",
    ", definitely played an important role where in some of those studies a near - threshold enhancement in the mass spectrum was found @xcite . in case of the radiative decay of @xmath4 this enhancement turned out to be so spectacular that it even nourished speculations that one might have found evidence for the existence of @xmath0 bound states @xcite .",
    "the most important factor is certainly the proposed facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) in darmstadt whose construction is finally on its way . among the various experiments planned at this site",
    "is the panda project @xcite which aims to study the interactions between antiprotons and fixed target protons and nuclei in the momentum range of 1.5 - 15 gev / c using the high energy storage ring hesr .",
    "another project suggested for the fair facility comes from the pax collaboration .",
    "this collaboration was formed @xcite with the aim to measure the proton transversity in the interaction of polarized antiprotons with protons . in order to produce an intense beam of polarized antiprotons , the collaboration intends to use antiproton elastic scattering off a polarized hydrogen target ( @xmath6h ) in a storage ring @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is connected to the result of the filtex experiment @xcite , where a sizeable effect of polarization buildup was achieved in a storage ring by scattering of unpolarized protons off a polarized hydrogen atoms at low beam energies of 23 mev .",
    "recent theoretical analyses @xcite have shown that the polarization buildup observed in ref .",
    "@xcite can be understood quantitatively . according to those authors it is solely due to the spin dependence of the hadronic ( proton - proton ) interaction which leads to the so - called spin - filtering mechanism , i.e. to a different rate of removal of beam protons from the ring for different polarization states of the target proton .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath7 case , the spin dependence of the @xmath3 interaction is poorly known .",
    "therefore , it is an open question whether any sizeable polarization buildup can also be achieved in case of an antiproton beam based on the spin - filtering mechanism .",
    "indeed , recently several theoretical studies were performed with the aim to estimate the expected polarization effects for antiprotons , employing different @xmath8 interactions @xcite . in this contribution",
    "i provide an overview and a comparison of the results of those investigations .",
    "furthermore , i take the opportunity to briefly recall the status of our knowledge of the spin dependence of the @xmath3 .",
    "thereby i focus on the only double - polarization observables measured so far , namely the depolarization parameter @xmath9 and the spin parameter @xmath10 @xcite    besides of using polarized protons as target one could also use light nuclei as possible source for the antiproton polarization buildup .",
    "a corresponding investigation for antiproton scattering on deuterons was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , cf .",
    "also a related contribution to these proceedings @xcite .",
    "since most of the results reported below are for @xmath3 interactions developed by the jlich group let me briefly summarize the salient features of those potential models . in fact , the jlich group has developed several @xmath11 models over the years @xcite . in the following",
    "i am going to present results for the models a(box ) , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and d , described in ref .",
    "starting point for both models is the full bonn @xmath7 potential  @xcite ; it includes not only traditional one - boson - exchange diagrams but also explicit @xmath12- and @xmath13-exchange processes as well as virtual @xmath14-excitations .",
    "the g - parity transform of this meson - exchange @xmath7 model provides the elastic part of the considered @xmath11 interaction models . in case of model a(box ) @xcite ( in the following referred to as model a ) a phenomenological , isospin- and energy - independent complex potential of gaussian form is added to account for the @xmath11 annihilation .",
    "it contains only three free parameters ( the strengths of the real and imaginary parts of the annihilation potential and its range ) , fixed in a fit to the available total and integrated @xmath3 cross sections . in case of model d @xcite , the most complete @xmath11 model of the jlich group , the @xmath11 annihilation into 2-meson decay channels",
    "is described microscopically , including all possible combinations of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25  see ref .",
    "@xcite for details  and only the decay into multi - meson channels is simulated by a phenomenological optical potential",
    ".    10.5 cm",
    "results for the total and integrated elastic ( @xmath26 ) and charge - exchange ( @xmath27 ) cross sections and also for angular dependent observables for both models can be found in refs .  @xcite .",
    "as one can see there , with model a as well as with d a very good overall reproduction of the low- and intermediate energy @xmath28 data is achieved .",
    "moreover , exclusive data on several @xmath29 2-meson and even 3-meson decay channels are described with fair quality @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that the @xmath3 models of the jlich group can also explain successfully the near - threshold enhancement seen in the @xmath0 mass spectrum of the reactions @xmath30 @xcite , @xmath31 @xcite and @xmath32 @xcite and in the @xmath33 cross section @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented a comparison of the jlich @xmath3 interaction with existing data for the @xmath34 channel @xcite , which is a purely isospin @xmath35 system .",
    "it showed that the jlich models are in nice agreement with the experimental information on the @xmath34 interaction too , despite the fact that those data on total and annihilation cross sections have not been included in the fitting procedure .",
    ".partial cross sections predicted by the jlich @xmath3 models a and d @xcite in comparison to results from the nijmegen @xmath3 partial wave analysis @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     as already mentioned in the introduction , the spin dependence of the @xmath3 interaction is not well known .",
    "there is a fair amount of data on analyzing powers , for @xmath0 elastic as well as for @xmath36 charge - exchange scattering , cf . ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "the predictions of the jlich models a and d are in reasonable agreement with the experimental polarizations up to beam momenta of @xmath37 mev / c as can be seen in ref .",
    "in fact , model a gives a somewhat better account of the data and reproduces the measured @xmath0 polarizations even quantitatively up to @xmath38 mev / c ( @xmath39 mev ) .",
    "as far as other spin - dependent observables are concerned , specifically with regard to double - polarization observables , there is only scant information on the depolarization @xmath9 @xcite and also on the spin parameter @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "moreover , those data are of rather limited accuracy so that they do not really provide serious constraints on the @xmath3 interaction . in order to illustrate the present status",
    "i show here those data together with predictions of the jlich models . they can be found in fig .",
    "[ dnel ] ( for @xmath40 ) and in fig .",
    "[ dnce ] ( for @xmath36 ) .",
    "interestingly the model results for the charge - exchange reaction are more or less in line with the data , while the depolarization predicted for elastic scattering is certainly too large .",
    "for fairness one should say that some of those data are already outside of the momentum range ( @xmath41 mev / c ) for which the jlich @xmath3 models were originally designed @xcite .    in this context",
    "let us mention that a partial - wave analysis ( pwa ) of @xmath0 scattering has been performed by the nijmegen group @xcite which , in principle , would allow to pin down the spin - dependence of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "however , the uniqueness of the achieved solution was disputed in ref .",
    "moreover , the actual partial - wave amplitudes of the nijmegen analysis are not readily available and , therefore , one can not confront the results of the jlich models directly with those of the nijmegen pwa .",
    "but at least the authors of @xcite published partial elastic and charge - exchange cross sections . in table",
    "[ table1 ] the results of the jlich @xmath3 models a and d are compared with those of the nijmegen pwa for the @xmath42- and @xmath43 waves .    as one can see from the table , qualitatively there is a good overall agreement between the two models and the nijmegen analysis",
    ". this may be not too surprising in view of the fact that all of them reproduce the bulk properties of @xmath0 scattering rather well .",
    "but one can see also drastic quantitative differences , specifically in the @xmath43 waves , where in some cases the partial cross sections of the nijmegen analysis differ by factors of 2 or even more from those of the jlich @xmath3 interactions .",
    "there are noticeable differences between the predictions of the models as well .",
    "clearly those differences will be reflected in the results for the spin - dependent @xmath0 cross sections which are considered next .",
    "the total polarized @xmath0 cross section can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the polarization vectors of the beam and target , respectively , and @xmath47 is a unit vector in the direction of the beam @xcite . in terms of the standard helicity amplitudes",
    "@xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) the cross sections are given by @xcite @xmath50 \\\\",
    "\\nonumber \\sigma_{1 } & = & \\phantom{- } \\frac{2\\pi}{k } { \\rm i m } [ m_2(0 ) ]   \\\\ \\sigma_{2 } & = & - \\frac{2\\pi}{k } { \\rm i m } [ m_1(0 ) + m_2(0 ) - m_3(0 ) ] ,   \\label{cnpp2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the modulus of the center - of - mass momentum of the antiproton .",
    "note that the above equations are only valid for the purely hadronic contribution ( called @xmath52 in the following ) to the cross sections .",
    "the coulomb - nuclear interference contribution to the cross sections , @xmath53 , has to be calculated by integration of the polarized differential @xmath0 cross section ( with the coulomb amplitudes included in the reaction amplitude ) over the scattering angle within the interval @xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 is the beam acceptance angle @xcite .",
    "then the total spin - dependent cross sections @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) are given by the sum @xmath58    10.5 cm    5.5 cm    predictions of the jlich @xmath3 interactions for the spin - dependent @xmath0 cross sections are presented in figs .",
    "[ totppda ] and [ totppc ] .",
    "figure  [ totppda ] contains results based on the purely hadronic amplitude ( @xmath59 ) and the coulomb - nuclear interference term ( @xmath53 ) separately so that one can see the magnitude of the latter . in the concrete calculations the acceptance angle was chosen to be @xmath60 mrad @xcite .    at low energies ,",
    "i.e. around @xmath61 mev , the interference terms are comparable to the corresponding purely hadronic cross sections and their magnitude increases further with decreasing energy due to the @xmath62 factor , cf .",
    "( 27 ) in ref .  @xcite .",
    "with increasing energy the relevance of the coulomb - nuclear interference terms diminishes more and more in case of the cross sections @xmath63 and @xmath2 .",
    "but for @xmath1 the term is still significant , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ totppda]b .",
    "note , that the three cross sections @xmath53 ( @xmath64 ) themselves are all roughly of comparable magnitude for energies from around 50 mev onwards .    while the predictions of the two models for @xmath63 are rather similar ( cf . figs .",
    "[ totppda]a ) , even for the coulomb - nuclear interference cross section , this is not the case for the spin - dependent cross sections @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for energies below @xmath65 mev",
    "there are drastic differences between the results based on the two models .",
    "indeed , for @xmath2 at low energies even the sign differs in case of the @xmath0 channel .",
    "obviously , here the variations in the hadronic amplitude are also reflected in large differences in the coulomb - nuclear interference term .    in fig .",
    "[ totppc ] the total spin - dependent cross sections @xmath1 and @xmath2 are displayed .",
    "as far as @xmath1 is concerned model a predicts a maximum of 12 mb at the beam energy @xmath66 mev whereas model d yields a maximum of practically the same magnitude at @xmath67 mev . in both cases @xmath1 becomes large and negative at very low energies due to the dominance of the coulomb - nuclear interference term in this region . for comparison ,",
    "i include here also results based on the nijmegen @xmath0 pwa , whose amplitudes were recently re - constructed by dmitriev",
    "note that the displayed curves are those for @xmath68 mrad @xcite .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest significantly larger values for @xmath1 over the whole considered energy range , cf .",
    "[ totppc ] . finally , there is also an investigation where a version of the paris @xmath3 model @xcite was employed @xcite . in that calculation",
    "the largest value for @xmath1 was found to be -15 mb at @xmath69 mev .    with regard to @xmath2 model a and d",
    "predict values around 10 mb for @xmath0 scattering at higher energies .",
    "close to threshold large negative values are predicted for @xmath70 due to the coulomb - nuclear interference term .",
    "one should note , however , that for beam energies below 5 mev , say , the total coulomb cross section becomes very large . in this case",
    "the beam lifetime turns out to be too short and the spin - filtering method can not be used for polarization buildup in a storage ring .    the results for @xmath2 based on the nijmegen @xmath0 pwa @xcite turn out to be fairly similar to the predictions of the jlich models , in particular for energies above 100 mev .",
    "( please note that our definition for the cross section @xmath2 differs from that in ref .",
    "@xcite : our @xmath2 is equal to @xmath71 as definined in eq .",
    "( 2 ) of ref .  @xcite . )",
    "the results based on the paris @xmath0 potential are similar to those of model d , at least for the energy range covered in ref .",
    "in this contribution i have reviewed predictions for the spin - dependent cross sections @xmath1 and @xmath2 using either @xmath3 potential models @xcite or @xmath3 amplitudes from a partial - wave analysis @xcite .",
    "there are significant differences in the various results  which is certainly not surprising given our incomplete knowledge of the spin dependence of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "the polarization buildup due to the spin - filtering mechanism is determined mainly by the ratio of the polarized total cross section @xmath56 ( i=1,2 ) to the unpolarized one ( @xmath63 ) @xcite . for the ratio @xmath72 all considered interactions predict values around 10% for beam energies above @xmath73 mev . for @xmath74 only the nijmegen pwa yields a ratio of comparable magnitude while the potential models predict significantly smaller values , specifically for higher energies .",
    "it should be said that yields of around 10% would be sufficient for the requirements of the pax experiment @xcite .    at present",
    "there are plans to investigate the polarization buildup mechanism in @xmath75h scattering in a new experiment at cern @xcite .",
    "the stored antiprotons will be scattered off a polarized @xmath6h target in that experiment @xcite and the polarization of the antiproton beam will be measured at intermediate energies . besides of being a test for the feasibility of spin - filtering for antiprotons this experiment will also provide data for the spin - dependent cross sections @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "such data will be very useful for constraining the spin dependence of the @xmath3 interaction .",
