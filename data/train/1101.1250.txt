    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) provide a laboratory to study various aspects of interstellar medium ( ism ) evolution across the whole electromagnetic spectrum . with the advent of high spatial resolution telescopes in both the x - ray and infrared ( ir ) regimes , it is possible to probe the interaction of the rapidly moving shock wave with the dust and gas of the surrounding ambient medium and to study the ejecta products of the sn itself .",
    "the expanding shockwave sweeps up and heats gas to @xmath0 k , causing it to shine brightly in x - rays .",
    "dust grains embedded in the hot , shocked plasma are collisionally heated , causing them to radiate at ir wavelengths , and slowly destroying them in the process via sputtering .",
    "because the physical processes behind x - ray and ir emission are related , a combined approach to studying snrs using both energy ranges can reveal more information than either could on its own .",
    "to better characterize ir emission from snrs , we conducted an imaging survey with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ of @xmath1 known snrs in the large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "the clouds were chosen because of their known distance and relatively low galactic ir background .",
    "subsequently , we obtained ir spectra of several of the snrs in the lmc using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on _ spitzer_. we report here on irs observations of two of these , snrs b0509 - 67.5 ( hereafter 0509 ) and b0519 - 69.0 ( hereafter 0519 ) .",
    "both are remnants of thermonuclear sne @xcite and have fast , non - radiative shocks ( several thousand km s@xmath2 ) @xcite",
    ". there is no evidence in either for slower , radiative shocks .",
    "they are both located in the lmc , at the known distance of @xmath3 kpc .",
    "in addition , both have ages determined from light echoes @xcite , with 0509 being 400 @xmath4 and 0519 being 600 @xmath5 years old .",
    "they are nearly identical in size , having an angular diameter of @xmath6  , which corresponds to a physical diameter of @xmath7 pc .    in @xcite",
    "hereafter paper i , we used 24 and 70 @xmath8 m imaging detections of both snrs to put limits on the post - shock density and the amount of dust destruction that has taken place behind the shock front , as well as put a limit on the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the ambient medium , which we found to be a factor of several times lower than the standard value for the lmc of @xmath9% ( weingartner & draine 2001 , hereafter wd01 ) .",
    "these limits , however , were based on only one ir detection , at 24 @xmath8 m , with upper limits placed on the 70 @xmath8 m detection .",
    "both remnants were detected with _",
    "@xcite at 15 and 24 @xmath8 m ( 0519 was also detected at 11 @xmath8 m ) .",
    "seok et al .",
    "applied single - temperature dust models to _ akari _ data , deriving warm dust masses of 8.7 @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath11 in 0509 and 0519 , respectively . with full spectroscopic data , we can place much more stringent constraints on the dust destruction and dust - to - gas mass ratio in the ism .",
    "we also explore alternative dust models , such as porous and composite grains .",
    "additionally , we examine archival data from the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) onboard the _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observatory . the high spectral resolution of rgs",
    "allows us to measure the strength of lines in x - ray spectra .",
    "we can use post - shock densities derived from ir fits to predict the strength of lines arising from shocked ambient medium , and can thus derive relative strengths of ejecta contributions to oxygen lines . doing this",
    "requires knowledge of the shock compression ratio , @xmath13 , defined as @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are postshock and preshock hydrogen number densities , respectively ) , which for a standard strong shock ( mach number @xmath17 1 ) is 4",
    ". however , shock dynamics will be modified @xcite if the shock is efficient at accelerating cosmic rays , and @xmath13 can be increased by a factor of several .",
    "we use several representative values of @xmath13 in modeling x - ray line strengths .",
    "we mapped both objects using the long wavelength ( 14 - 38 @xmath8 m ) , low - resolution ( @xmath18 64 - 128 ) ( ll ) spectrometer on _",
    "spitzer s _ irs ( program i d 40604 ) . for 0509 , we stepped across the remnant in seven ll slit pointings , stepping perpendicularly 5.1@xmath19 each time .",
    "this step size is half the slit width , and is also the size of a pixel on the ll spectrograph .",
    "we then shifted the slit positions by 56@xmath19 in the parallel direction and stepped across the remnant again , ensuring redundancy for the entire object .",
    "this process was repeated for each of the two orders of the spectrograph .",
    "each pointing consisted of two 120-second cycles , for a total observing time of 6720 s.    for 0519 , the process was identical in terms of number of positions and step sizes in between mappings , but each pointing consisted of four 30-second cycles , for a total observing time of 3360 s. the difference was due to the fact that 0519 is several times brighter in the wavelength range of interest , and we did not want to saturate the detectors .    to estimate the uncertainties in the data , we fit a second - order polynomial to the line - free wavelength regions ( @xmath20 @xmath8 m ) in the spectra where the signal - to - noise was adequate for modeling .",
    "the standard deviations of the data points in these regions were used for @xmath21 fitting of dust emission models ( see section  [ errors ] ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath22 values of 0.830 and 2.53 mjy for 0509 and 0519 , respectively .",
    "the spectra were processed at the _ spitzer science center _ using version 17.1 of the irs pipeline .",
    "we ran a clipping algorithm on the spectra which removes both hot and cold pixels that are more than 3-@xmath22 away from the average of the surrounding pixels . to extract the spectra , we used spice , the _ spitzer _ custom extraction tool .",
    "once all spectra were extracted , we stacked spectra from the same spatial location , improving the signal - to - noise ratio of the sources . for background subtraction , we use the off source slit positions that come when one of the two slit orders is on the source . in the end",
    ", we have seven ( overlapping ) background subtracted spectra for each remnant . as we show in section  [ results ] , this allows us to do spatially resolved spectroscopy , despite the fact that the remnants are only @xmath23 in diameter .",
    "we processed archival _ xmm - newton _ rgs data from the xmm science archive with version 8.0 of the science analysis subsystem ( sas ) software for xmm .",
    "rgs provides high - resolution ( @xmath24 @xmath25  ) x - ray spectroscopy in the wavelength range from 5 - 38  .",
    "b0509 - 67.5 was observed on 4 july 2000 ( obs .",
    "i d 0111130201 , pi m. watson ) for 36 ksec . of these 36 ksec ,",
    "only the last @xmath26 s were affected by flaring .",
    "we discarded these and use the remaining 33.5 ksec for our analysis .",
    "we use the spectra from both rgs 1 and 2 , and bin the data using the ftool _ grppha _ to a minimum of 25 counts per bin .",
    "both rgs orders contained @xmath27 counts after time - filtering .",
    "b0519 - 69.0 was observed on 17 september 2001 ( obs .",
    "i d 0113000501 , pi j. kaastra ) for 48.4 ksec .",
    "after time filtering , we obtained @xmath28 ksec of useful data , with @xmath29 counts in both rgs 1 and 2 .",
    "we also grouped these by a minimum of 25 counts per bin .",
    "since rgs is a slitless spectrometer , spatial information is degraded for extended sources , and the spectrum is smeared by the image of the source . in order to model rgs spectra",
    ", the response files generated by sas must be convolved with a high - resolution x - ray image . for that purpose",
    ", we used archival broadband chandra images from 2001 ( obs .",
    "i d 776 , pi j. hughes ) , along with the ftool _ rgsrmfsmooth _ , to produce new response matrices .",
    "in the top left panel of figure  [ 24um ] , we show the mips 24 @xmath8 m image of 0509 , with overlays as described in the caption .",
    "immediately obvious is the large asymmetry in 0509 , where the remnant brightens from the faint ne hemisphere to the brighter sw . dividing the remnant in half and measuring the 24 @xmath8 m fluxes from each half",
    ", we find a flux ratio of five between these two regions . at x - ray wavelengths ,",
    "we measure a much more modest ratio of 1.5 from archival broadband _",
    "chandra _ images . using irs , we separated the remnant into 7 overlapping regions from which spectra were extracted . for our analysis , we chose two regions ( shown on figure  [ 24um ] ) that do not overlap spatially and provide adequate signal to noise spectra .",
    "these regions roughly correspond to the bright and faint halves of the remnant , and the spectra are shown in figure  [ faintvsbright ] . in figure  [ 0509faint ] and",
    "figure  [ 0509bright ] , we show both of these spectra separately , with models overlaid ( models are discussed in section  [ modeling ] ) .",
    "the ratio of integrated fluxes from 14 - 35 @xmath8 m for the two regions is @xmath30 .",
    "this differs from the factor of 5 measured from the photometric images because the slits are not exactly aligned with the bright and faint halves of the remnant , and because of the differences in the mips and irs bandpasses .",
    "a few obvious features immediately stand out about both spectra .",
    "first , there is no line emission at all seen in either spectrum .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the shocks in 0509 are some of the fastest snr shocks known , at @xmath31 km s@xmath2 @xcite , and there is no optical evidence for radiative shocks .",
    "second , though both spectra show continuum from warm dust , there are obvious differences in the spectra .",
    "an inflection around 18 @xmath8 m can be seen in the spectrum from the bright half , while this feature is not as clear in the faint spectrum .",
    "we attribute this feature to the si - o - si bending mode in amorphous silicate dust . in section  [ disc ] , we will explore reasons for the different spectral shapes and the differences in brightness between the two halves of the remnant .      in the bottom left panel of figure  [ 24um ]",
    ", we show the 24 @xmath8 m image of 0519 , which does not show the large scale asymmetries that 0509 does , although three bright knots can be seen in the image .",
    "these same three knots can be identified in both h@xmath32 @xcite and x - ray images , where _ chandra _ broadband data shows that the three knots are prominent in the 0.3 - 0.7 kev band @xcite . in paper",
    "i , we measured the total flux from the three knots added together and found that collectively they represent only about 20% of the flux .",
    "nevertheless , spectra extracted from slits that contain a bright knot do show differences in continuum slope from those extracted where no knots are present .",
    "we discuss our interpretation of these knots in section  [ disc ] . as with 0509",
    ", there are no lines seen in the irs data ( see figure  [ 0519irs ] ) , as shock speeds are also quite high in this object .",
    "we now turn our attention to modeling the emission seen in irs with numerical models of collisionally heated dust grains .",
    "we follow a procedure identical to that followed in our previous work on these objects ; see paper i. the heating rate of a dust grain immersed in a hot plasma depends on both the gas density ( collision rate ) and gas temperature ( energy per collision ) .",
    "in general , the electron temperature of a shocked plasma can be determined from fits to x - ray spectra . in the case of these objects , plane - shock models without collisionless heating of electrons at the shock front yield the temperature .",
    "dust heating models do depend on this temperature , but the dependency is not large @xcite .",
    "gas density is a much more sensitive parameter for dust heating models , and is determined by the temperature of the grains .",
    "we regard postshock gas density as a free parameter in our model , and fine tune the density to match the observed ir spectra .",
    "we take into account sputtering by ions , which destroys small grains and sputters material off large grains .",
    "we use a plane - shock model which superimposes regions of increasing shock age ( or sputtering timescale ) @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is post - shock proton density , while keeping temperature behind the shock constant .",
    "inputs to the model are an assumed pre - shock grain - size distribution , grain type and abundance , proton and electron density , ion and electron temperature . the code calculates the heating and sputtering for grains from 1 nm to 1 @xmath8 m , producing a grain temperature and spectrum for each grain size .",
    "the spectra are then added in proper proportions according to the post - sputtering size distribution to produce a model spectrum that can be compared with observations .",
    "we use sputtering rates from @xcite with enhancements for small grains from @xcite .",
    "we assume that sputtering yields are proportional to the amount of energy deposited by incoming particles , accounting for partial transparency of grains to protons and alpha particles at high energies @xcite , particularly relevant for 0509 and 0519 .",
    "we assume that grains are compact spheres , but we also report results and implications if grains are porous ( i.e. contain a nonzero volume filling fraction of vacuum ) .    in general , our method is to fix as many of the input parameters as possible , based on what is known from other observations . for instance , @xcite used optical light echoes to constrain the ages of both remnants , yielding ages of @xmath35 yrs . for 0509 and @xmath36 yrs . for 0519 .",
    "shock velocities are known approximately for both objects from measurements of ion temperatures @xcite . in 0509 ,",
    "the standard shock jump conditions for a 7000 km s@xmath2 shock , the assumed speed for the ne half of the remnant @xcite with no ion - electron equilibration would produce proton temperatures of @xmath37 kev .",
    "recently , @xcite used vlt spectroscopy to detect a broad h@xmath32 component from the rim of 0509 , determining the shock speed to be @xmath38 km s@xmath2 in the ne .",
    "they give several possibilities for the proton temperature in the ne , and note that energy from escaping cosmic - rays limits the post - shock proton temperature to a value of @xmath39 0.85 of that expected from the strong shock jump conditions .",
    "adopting this value of 0.85 , along with a shock speed of 6000 km s@xmath2 and no electron heating gives a post - shock proton temperature of @xmath3970 kev .",
    "we use this value as an input to dust heating models , except where noted otherwise ( see section  [ iontemp ] )",
    ". this upper limit on proton temperature makes any fit to the density for 0509 a lower limit , and we discuss the effects of changing the proton temperature in section  [ iontemp ] .    the shock speed in 0519 is a bit more uncertain .",
    "@xcite quote a range of 2600 - 4500 km s@xmath2 between the limits of minimal and full ion - electron equilibration .",
    "@xcite measured line widths of x - ray iron lines seen in _ xmm - newton _ rgs spectra to obtain a velocity of 2927 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we adopt a value of 3000 km s@xmath2 for this work and use the standard shock jump proton temperature assuming no electron - ion equilibration , which is 21 kev .",
    "the actual proton temperature may differ from this estimate , but the fitting of dust spectra in the ir is only weakly dependent on the proton temperature ( see section  [ iontemp ] ) .",
    "the overall normalization of the model to the data ( combined with the known distance to the lmc ) provides the mass in dust .",
    "since our models calculate the amount of sputtering that takes place in the shock , we can then determine the amount of dust present in the pre - shock undisturbed ism that has been encountered by the blast wave .",
    "while we are sensitive only to `` warm '' dust , and could in principle be underestimating the mass in dust if a large percentage of it is too cold to radiate at irs wavelengths , it is difficult to imagine a scenario where any significant amount of dust goes unheated by such hot gas behind the high - velocity shocks present in both remnants , particularly given the upper limits at 70 @xmath8 m reported in @xcite ( and the fact that there are no radiative shocks observed anywhere in these remnants ) .",
    "the only fitted parameters in the model are the post - shock proton number density , which affects the shape of the model spectrum , and the radiating dust mass , which affects the overall normalization .",
    "all other variable parameters ( e.g. electron density , sputtering timescale ) depend directly on the density .",
    "we use an optimization algorithm to minimize the value of @xmath21 in the regions of the spectra with high signal - to - noise ( for both remnants , @xmath20 @xmath8 m ) to find the best - fitting value of the density .",
    "we then calculate upper and lower limits on the fitted density as the 90% confidence intervals in @xmath21 space ( where confidence intervals correspond to @xmath40 + 2.71 ) , using the standard deviations listed in section 2 .",
    "the errors on both the density and dust mass present are of order 25% for 0509 and 10% for 0519 .",
    "larger errors in 0509 are due to a poorer signal - to - noise ratio in the spectrum .",
    "we assume that the plasma temperature is fixed at the values listed above , but again note that the dependency on proton and electron temperature is small ( see section  [ iontemp ] ) .",
    "there are also several sources of uncertainty in modeling emission from warm dust grains that are hard to quantify statistically .",
    "first and foremost , we are limited by both the spatial resolution of _ spitzer _ for such small snrs and the low signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra .",
    "we use a plane - shock model with constant plasma temperature to model dust emission , which is only an approximation to a spherical blast wave .",
    "estimates of swept gas mass assume constant ambient density ahead of the shock .",
    "sputtering rates for such high temperature protons and alpha particles are probably only accurate to within a factor of 2 ( but see appendix a ) , and we use the simple approximation that the sputtering rate varies according to the amount of energy deposited into a grain of given size and composition .",
    "lastly , but possibly most importantly , we do not know the degree of porosity and mixing of various grain types .",
    "although we have full spectral mapping of both objects , the 10.5@xmath19 width of the irs slit severely limits the amount of spatially resolved spectroscopy we can do on remnants that are only 30@xmath19 in diameter , as both 0509 and 0519 are . despite this , we do have several disjoint slit positions which isolate spectra from the most prominent features in the images . because dust radiates as a modified blackbody spectrum , emission from a small amount of warmer dust can overwhelm that from a larger amount of colder dust , particularly at the wavelengths of interest here .",
    "we show in figure  [ 0509faint ] and figure  [ 0509bright ] spectra extracted from two regions of 0509 , which we label the `` faint '' and `` bright '' portions of the remnant .",
    "fits to these regions require a density contrast of @xmath41 in the post - shock gas , with the higher density required in the `` bright '' region ( higher densities means hotter dust , hence more short wavelength emission ) .",
    "although it might be possible that a density gradient of this order actually exists in the ambient medium surrounding 0509 ( the angular size of 30@xmath19 in the lmc corresponds to a linear diameter of about 7 pc ) , the implications from this model lead to several scenarios which are unlikely and require an appeal to special circumstances .    in comparing the mips image with images of the remnant at other wavelengths , one can clearly see an enhancement in the _ chandra _ broadband image @xcite on the southwest side of the remnant .",
    "this enhancement is mostly present in the energy range containing fe l - shell emission lines .",
    "the h@xmath32 image , shown in figure  [ 24um ] , shows a uniform periphery around the remnant , with the exception of a brightness enhancement in the sw , relatively well confined to a small region . to compare the images , we convolved the h@xmath32 image to the resolution of the 24 @xmath8 m image using the mips 24 @xmath8 m psf .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ halpha_conv ] .",
    "the images are morphologically similar , and from these comparisons we conclude that there is not an overall ne - sw density gradient in the ism .",
    "rather , the ism is mostly uniform except for the sw , where the remnant is running into a localized region of higher density . to obtain the conditions for the whole of the remnant",
    ", we fit a model to the `` faint '' region , freezing all parameters to those reported in table 1 and allowing post - shock density to vary ( which also causes the sputtering timescale to vary ) .",
    "if we assume a standard lmc dust model @xcite , we get a post - shock density of @xmath15 = 0.59 @xmath42 .",
    "the reduced @xmath21 value for this model was 1.04 .",
    "values in table  [ resultstable0509 ] correspond to this `` faint '' region .",
    "we can use irs to estimate the spatial extent of the bright region .",
    "first , by looking at the 2-d spectra from the ll slit located directly on top of the brightest region in the mips 24 @xmath8 m image , we fit a gaussian to the spatial profile ( indicated by an arrow in figure  [ 24um_7points ] ) of the emission between 16 and 17 @xmath8 m , and found a fwhm of the brightness profile of 12.7  .",
    "this wavelength is the shortest at which we could achieve a good signal - to - noise ratio for this region .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "resolution at 16 @xmath8 m is about 4.75  . in the direction perpendicular to the slit positions",
    ", we had 7 slit pointings , each separated by 5.1  .",
    "extracting spectra from each of these ( overlapping ) positions , subtracting the background , and integrating over the irs bandpass gave us 7 measurements of the brightness as a function of position .",
    "the locations from which these spectra were extracted are shown as diamonds in figure  [ 24um_7points ] , and the resulting normalized intensity function is shown in figure  [ intensitymap ] .",
    "the brightness peaks at position 3 , the position we used to examine 2-d spectra , as described above , and falls off relatively quickly on both sides away from that position .",
    "our assumption that the bright region of 0509 is the result of a more localized enhancement in density implies that the spectrum extracted from that region is then a composite of emission from the uniform parts of the remnant and from the small , denser region . _",
    "spitzer _ does not have the resolution required to isolate this dense region , but we can make a crude isolation by assuming that the two slit positions in figure  [ 24um ] cover an equal surface area on the remnant , and subtracting the faint spectrum from the bright .",
    "the residual spectrum is of less than ideal signal - to - noise .",
    "nevertheless , a fit to this spectrum implies a gas density of @xmath43 @xmath42 , or about an order of magnitude higher than the rest of the remnant .",
    "a small region of hot dust outshines a more massive region of cooler dust at 24 @xmath8 m , which would explain the factor of 5 ratio in the flux between the two sides .",
    "x - rays from this object are dominated by ejecta , not swept - up ism , and there are several factors to consider beyond density when considering the flux of h@xmath32 coming from a region .",
    "higher resolution observations at all wavelengths will shine more light on this issue .    for 0519",
    "we have a similar scenario , except that instead of one bright region , we have three bright knots . as noted previously , these knots correspond spatially with knots seen in both x - rays and h@xmath32 ( see figure  [ 24um ] ) .",
    "we adopt an identical strategy here , isolating spectra from slit positions that do not overlap with one of the bright knots .",
    "as it turns out , there is only one slit position in this object that is nearly completely free of emission from a knot , a slit position that goes directly across the middle of the remnant . the spectrum from this region is shown in figure  [ 0519irs ] .",
    "we assume that the conditions within this slit position are indicative of the remnant as a whole . using parameters found in table 1 ,",
    "we obtain a post - shock density of @xmath15 = 6.2 @xmath42 ( reduced @xmath21 = 1.13 ) .",
    "we do not have adequate signal - to - noise to isolate the bright knots individually .",
    "however , we approximate the density required by noting that a fit to the spectrum extracted from the entire slit position that contains the brightest of the three knots ( the northernmost knot ) requires a density that is higher by a factor of @xmath44 . given that this spectrum contains emission from both the uniform parts of the remnant and the bright knot , it is likely that the density in the knot itself is perhaps a factor of @xmath45 higher that the more uniform parts of the remnant , which is roughly consistent with our results from paper i.",
    "while it is typically assumed in dust grain models that grains are solid bodies composed of various materials , this is likely not a physically valid model ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it is possible to relax the assumption that grains are compact spheres with a filling fraction of unity .",
    "we have updated dust models to include the porosity of dust grains ( where porosity , @xmath46 , is the fraction of the grain volume that is composed of vacuum , instead of grain material ) , as well as allowing for grains to be composite in nature , i.e. a grain made up of silicates , graphite , amorphous carbon , and vacuum .",
    "the details of this model are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we summarize here the important results .",
    "perhaps the most significant effect of introducing porosity to grains is that the grain volume per unit mass increases , since the overall density of the grain is lowered . as a result , grains are more efficient radiators of energy , and less dust mass in total is required to reproduce an observed ir luminosity .    for a grain of the same mass ,",
    "the grain is heated to a higher temperature if it is solid than if it is porous . as a result of the equilibrium temperature being lower for porous grains ,",
    "more heating is necessary to fit the same spectrum with a porous grain model than a solid grain model . for a fixed plasma temperature , this",
    "can only be achieved by increasing the post - shock density . in summary , increasing the porosity of grains has the dual effects of raising the necessary postshock density required to heat grains to an observed temperature , while lowering the total amount of dust required to reproduce an observed luminosity .",
    "what remains is to choose a grain `` recipe '' to use to fit the data .",
    "since there are few constraints from the ism at this time , we have adopted here two values of @xmath47 , 25 and 50% , to explore the effects of grain porosity of fitting ir data .",
    "our `` _ compact _ '' model , which we used to derive results given above , assumes separate populations of solid silicate and graphite grains with appropriate size distributions for the lmc ( wd01 ) .",
    "our `` _ porous _ '' grain models are based on those of @xcite . for the 25% porous model",
    ", we assume that grains are composed of 25% vacuum , 50% silicate , and 25% amorphous carbon .",
    "the 50% porous grains contain 50% vacuum , 33.5% silicate , and 16.5% amorphous carbon , distributed from 0.0025 to 1.5 @xmath8 m .",
    "the narrow bandwidth of the irs data does not allow us to determine which model fits the data better , as we obtained equally good fits from all models ( albeit with a different value of density ) , and report results from all .",
    "a caveat to using these porous grain distributions is that both of them were optimized for the galaxy , and not the lmc .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , a size distribution appropriate for porous grains in the lmc has not yet been developed .",
    "the results are as follows : for 0509 , the best - fit @xmath47 = 25% model had a post - shock density , @xmath15 , of 1.1 @xmath42 ( @xmath21 = 1.05 ) , while the @xmath47 = 50% model required an @xmath15 of 2.2 @xmath42 ( @xmath21 = 1.07 ) . for 0519 ,",
    "the best - fit densities were 9.5 ( @xmath21 = 1.08 ) and 17 ( @xmath21 = 1.07 ) @xmath42 for @xmath46 = 25 and 50% , respectively . in all cases ,",
    "we assume lmc abundances , such that @xmath48 = 1.2@xmath15 .",
    "although dust models in the ir are a powerful diagnostic of the post - shock gas , they are insensitive to pre - shock gas conditions , which determine the total swept mass . unlike many snrs ,",
    "both of these objects have relatively well - defined ages and distances .",

    "the product of post - shock electron density and total gas mass overrun by the blast wave is proportional to the emission measure ( em ) of the x - ray emitting plasma . when combined with the ionization timescale ( @xmath49 ) and electron temperature of the gas , we have all the information necessary to generate a model x - ray spectrum for the shocked ambient medium , which we can compare directly to observed x - ray spectra .",

    "a small ejecta contribution to the o ly@xmath32 line is still necessary for line ratios to match .",
    "if grains are porous , a lower ejecta contribution to oxygen lines observed in 0509 would be permitted , even for values of @xmath13 that are closer to the standard shock value .",
    "however , in 0519 , much higher @xmath13 values would be required to bring model oxygen line fluxes down to observed levels , even with no contribution from the ejecta .",
    "we require significantly less oxygen in the ejecta than @xcite , who report an o ejecta mass of 0.2 - 0.3 @xmath11 .",
    "minimum values for @xmath13 would be 20 and 34 for @xmath47 = 25% and 50% , respectively .",

    "dust - to - gas mass ratios in 0509 are closer to expected values , but are , in most cases in table  [ resultstable0509 ] , still too low .",
    "it may be that snrs that are in regions of low background sufficient to allow a high enough signal - to - noise ratio for a detailed study in the mid- and far - ir have such a low background because they are in atypical regions of the ism , creating an observational bias .",
    "in addition , dust - to - gas mass ratio determinations from snrs are _ spot _ measurements , and are not averaged over long lines of sight or large fields of view .",
    "porous dust grains require a higher density relative to compact grains to reproduce the same spectrum , because they are more efficient radiators of energy than compact grains .",
    "for this reason , the inferred dust mass from the porous grain models , seen in table 2 , is lower by a factor of @xmath128 .",

    "it should be noted though , that typical dust - to - gas mass ratios calculated for the ism in general ( such as the 0.25% given above from wd01 ) inherently assume compact grains .",
    "one possibility that has been suggested for snrs of both type ia and cc origin @xcite is that large amounts of dust are indeed present , but are too cold ( t@xmath130 @xmath131 k ) to be detectable at _ spitzer _ wavelengths and are only visible in the sub - millimeter regime .",
    "if this is true , then the total dust - to - gas mass ratio for the ism could be quite different from what we report here , which is based only on `` warm '' dust .",
    "this claim has been disputed for kepler s snr @xcite based on a detection at 70 @xmath8 m and an upper limit at 160 @xmath8 m , but we lack detection at either wavelength here , and upper limits are unconstraining . _ herschel _ observations would provide the key wavelength coverage between the mid - ir and sub - mm necessary to settle this issue . a recent _ herschel _ observation of cas",
    "a at wavelengths up to 500 @xmath8 m revealed only 0.075 @xmath11 of dust there , much of which may be newly - formed ejecta dust @xcite .",
    "how cold would dust have to be to escape detection at 70 @xmath8 m , assuming a standard dust - to - gas mass ratio for the lmc ? obviously , the answer depends on the choice of models from tables 2 & 3 . as an example",
    ", we consider the @xmath47 = 0 model for 0519 with the highest value for @xmath13 ( the only model for this remnant that seems to not be ruled out by x - ray lines ) .",
    "the swept gas mass for this case is 6.1 @xmath11 , and assuming a dust - to - gas ratio of 0.35% gives a dust mass of 2.1 @xmath132 @xmath11 . in order to avoid",
    "violating the 70 @xmath8 m upper limit of 121 mjy @xcite , post - shock dust in this remnant would need to be @xmath133 k. if we choose the standard @xmath13 case , the implied dust mass would be 5.5 @xmath134 @xmath11 , and the required post - shock dust temperature would be @xmath135 k. both of these numbers are significantly lower than those fit to irs data or those predicted by grain heating models .",
    "such low temperatures could only be acheived by having the dust reside in very dense clumps .",
    "shocks driven into such clumps should quickly become radiative , but no [ o iii ] or [ s ii ] emission is seen from either remnant .",
    "we present mid - ir spectral observations of two young snrs in the lmc , 0509 - 67.5 and 0519 - 69.0 , as well as analysis of archival high - resolution x - ray spectra . by fitting dust heating and sputtering models to ir spectra , we can determine post - shock gas density .",
    "we derive post - shock densities of 0.59 and 6.2 @xmath42 in 0509 and 0519 , respectively , using a compact grain model .",
    "porous grains require a density higher by a factor of a few . by assuming a value for the shock compression ratio , @xmath13",
    ", we can infer the pre - shock density , swept gas mass , strength of oxygen ly@xmath32 and k@xmath32 x - ray lines , and dust - to - gas mass ratio for the ambient ism . derived values for the pre - shock density of the ism vary greatly depending on the model used and compression ratio assumed , but for the sake of comparison , values listed in tables 2 & 3 are comparable to densities inferred from various line - of - sight hi column densities through the lmc .",
    "these column densities vary from 10@xmath52 @xmath53 to a few @xmath123 @xmath53 , which , assuming an lmc depth of 1 kpc , yields densities of @xmath136 . for standard strong shocks , @xmath13 is 4 , but modification by cosmic rays would increase this by an unknown amount .",
    "we report values of the quantities above for several plausible values of @xmath13 . in principle",
    ", this method could be used in reverse to determine @xmath13 .",
    "this would require x - ray emission from shocked ambient medium that is well - separated from ejecta emission ; thus , x - ray lines could be modeled as solely arising from material at cosmic abundances .",
    "we believe this method can be used for older , larger remnants in the lmc , such as dem l71 .    based on our analysis , a significant fraction of the o line emission seen in the x - ray spectrum of 0509 arises from the ejecta .",
    "if grains are highly porous , then the ejecta contribution is less , but a contribution is still required because the line flux ratios observed still do not match the model ratios .",
    "both standard shocks and cosmic - ray modified shocks with higher @xmath13 values can provide acceptable fits for 0509 .",
    "the data for 0509 are inconclusive in favoring either compact or porous grains .",
    "compact grains require nearly all of the oxygen seen in x - ray spectra to be coming from shocked ejecta , while porous grains would significantly lower the ejecta contribution , implying a higher contribution from the forward - shocked material .    in 0519",
    ", there is significant evidence for higher than standard compression , and little contribution from ejecta to o x - ray lines .",
    "a shock speed of @xmath39 2300 km s@xmath2 is favored for this object from hydrodynamical simulations , in order to reproduce the observed size , age , and x - ray line widths .",
    "compact grains are favored for this remnant .",
    "the standard value of @xmath137 is possible only if absorption to the remnant is significantly higher than has been reported .",
    "the column density from the lmc would need to be at least @xmath138 @xmath53 to bring oxygen lines in the model down to below observed values .",
    "@xcite derive an upper limit for 0519 of @xmath139 , implying an upper limit to the hi column density of @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "we derive dust - to - gas mass ratios that are lower by a factor of several than what is generally expected in the ism .",
    "since the general properties of dust in the ism come from optical / uv absorption line studies averaged over long lines of sight , it is possible that there exist large local variations on smaller scales .",
    "the ratios presented here probe parsec scales .",
    "another potential explanation is that the sputtering rate for dust grains is significantly understated in the literature .",
    "however , since the deficit of dust is about an order of magnitude , sputtering rates would also have to be increased by this amount to account for the discrepancy . also , because sputtering rates typically assume a compact grain , further work in this field will be needed to determine if these rates are appropriate for porous grains .",
    "extremely high values for @xmath13 ( @xmath68 50 ) could bring dust - to - gas mass ratios up to more typical values , but such values are ruled out by radio observations .",
    "a possible observational bias could exist , in that snrs that are easy to study in the ir ( i.e. , well separated from sources of ir confusion ) could be found preferentially in low - dust regions of the ism .",
    "studies such as this will benefit greatly from the increases in both spatial resolution and sensitivity of future generations of telescopes , such as the _ james webb space telescope_. being able to spatially separate the dust spectra right behind the shock from that further inside the shell will be crucial to reducing some of the uncertainties listed above .",
    "longer wavelength observations with the _ herschel space observatory _ would be useful for detecting or placing upper limits on any cold dust that may be present in the remnant .",

    "in young snrs , and in 0509 in particular , proton temperatures are much higher than electron temperatures , and heating by protons can not be neglected as it can in slower shocks where temperatures have had time to equilibrate . here",
    "we investigate whether simple analytic approximations to proton and alpha particle energy deposition rates are valid at ion energies approaching or exceeding 100 kev .",
    "the stopping power ( energy loss per unit path length ) and projected range ( average length traveled by a particle into a material ) for both electrons and protons into a given grain are generally given by analytic expressions approximating experimental data .",
    "for electrons , these expressions fit the experimental data to within 15% for the energy range of 20 ev to 1 mev @xcite . for protons and alpha particles ,",
    "the approximate stopping power , based on experimental data from @xcite and @xcite , is given by @xcite as      where @xmath226 is the mass density of the grain .",
    "the authors caution that this expression is valid only for @xmath227 kev .",
    "we raise here two questions : 1 ) are these approximations appropriate for energies at or exceeding the 100 kev threshold ( as may well be the case in very young snrs with shock speeds exceeding 6000 km s@xmath2 ) ?",
    "2 ) these approximations are based on data over 30 years old ; are they still valid ?    to answer both of these questions , we turn to more recent laboratory data on the stopping power of protons and alpha particles in various materials , obtained from the online _ pstar _ and _ astar _ databases published and maintained by the national institute of standards and technology . in figure  [ si02stopping ] , we show the stopping power of a proton in silicon dioxide as a function of energy .",
    "the stopping power turns over above @xmath228 kev .",
    "since , for an extremely fast shock , there will be a significant population of protons with energies in this range , this turnover should be properly accounted for in calculating the projected range of the particle .",
    "interstellar grains are more complicated than silicon dioxide ( although it is possible that sio@xmath229 is a minor component of ism dust )",
    ". since the nist databases only have information available for actual materials that can be measured in the lab , materials like `` astronomical silicate ( mgfesio@xmath230 ) '' are not available .",
    "the individual stopping powers for the constituent elements are available , however , and can be combined to approximate the stopping power for a grain of arbitrary composition . to do this ,",
    "we use `` bragg s rule , '' @xcite , given by      where @xmath232 is the total stopping power of a molecule @xmath233 , and @xmath234 and @xmath235 are the stopping powers of the individual constituents .",
    "since mg is not included in the nist database , we use the results of @xcite .",
    "thus , for mgfesio@xmath230 , one has      the calculated projected range for protons based on this stopping power ( similarly for graphite ) are given by the following polynomial expressions in logarithmic - space , where @xmath237 is the energy of the impinging particle in kev :            ultimately , it is necessary to determine how much energy is deposited into the grain by an impinging particle , in order to calculate grain heating rates and determine whether these improved energy deposition rates matter . in figure",
    "[ heatingrateratio ] , we show the ratio of the heating rate , @xmath242 , calculated from the nist energy deposition rates and that calculated from the analytical approximations of @xcite and @xcite , for a proton temperature of 100 kev , which is relevant for the fast shocks , such as those seen in 0509 .",
    "figure  [ spectracompare ] shows a comparison of the spectra of grains heated behind such a shock , for both the modified energy deposition rates described above and the analytical approximations .",
    "figure  [ spectraratio ] shows the ratio of the spectra .",
    "the main difference is in the 18 - 40 @xmath8 m range , but the maximum difference is only @xmath243% .",
    "the use of analytical approximations to proton heating rates should be valid for most cases .",
    "nonetheless , we use the modified rates in reporting results in this work .",
    "because heating by protons is non - negligible in the case of such fast shocks and high ion temperatures , it is necessary to account for relative gas - grain motions between dust grains and ions in the plasma .",
    "grain heating rates for protons and alpha particles are increased by 35 and 112% , respectively , over the case where grains are at rest with respect to the plasma .",
    "grain heating is still dominated by electrons , though , so the overall heating rate is increased by only @xmath244 25% for the moving grain case .",
    "when folded through the model , this results in a decrease of about 10% in the plasma densities necessary to fit irs data .",
    "these numbers are reported throughout the text .",
    "we assume that the charge - to - mass ratio of the grains is sufficiently low that grains are not immediately affected by the passage of the shock ."

    "<S> we present results from mid - ir spectroscopic observations of two young supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) done with the _ spitzer space telescope_. we imaged snrs b0509 - 67.5 and b0519 - 69.0 with _ spitzer _ in 2005 , and follow - up spectroscopy presented here confirms the presence of warm , shock heated dust , with no lines present in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we use model fits to _ spitzer _ irs data to estimate the density of the postshock gas . </S>",
    "<S> both remnants show asymmetries in the infrared images , and we interpret bright spots as places where the forward shock is running into material that is several times denser than elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> the densities we infer for these objects depend on the grain composition assumed , and we explore the effects of differing grain porosity on the model fits . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze archival _ xmm - newton _ rgs spectroscopic data , where both snrs show strong lines of both fe and si , coming from ejecta , as well as strong o lines , which may come from ejecta or shocked ambient medium . </S>",
    "<S> we use model fits to irs spectra to predict x - ray o line strengths for various grain models and values of the shock compression ratio . for 0509 - 67.5 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that compact ( solid ) grain models require nearly all o lines in x - ray spectra to originate in reverse - shocked ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> porous dust grains would lower the strength of ejecta lines relative to those arising in the shocked ambient medium . in 0519 - 69.0 </S>",
    "<S> , we find significant evidence for a higher than standard compression ratio of 12 , implying efficient cosmic - ray acceleration by the blast wave . a compact grain model is favored over porous grain models . </S>",
