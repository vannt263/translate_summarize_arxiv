    "central exclusive production at the tevatron is the process @xmath8 , where `` @xmath9 '' means a rapidity gap @xmath10 exceeding 3 units , and @xmath11 is a simple system fully measured .",
    "exchanges ( @xmath12-channel ) over such large gaps must be color singlets with spin @xmath13 [ or regge intercept @xmath14 @xmath15 1.0 . only photons @xmath16 and pomerons @xmath17 qualify , apart from @xmath18 and @xmath19 bosons which always cause the proton to break up .",
    "the gluon @xmath20 would qualify apart from its color , but if another gluon is exchanged that can be cancelled , and @xmath21 is often a good approximation .",
    "it can not be exact ; qcd forbids a pure @xmath22 state , and a @xmath23 component certainly grows as @xmath24 increases .",
    "the @xmath17 has c = + 1 ; in qcd one should also have a @xmath25 state with c = -1 , the odderon  @xcite @xmath26 , not yet observed .",
    "the central masses @xmath27 are roughly limited to @xmath28 with the outgoing protons having feynman @xmath29 0.95 .",
    "hence @xmath30 3 gev at the cern isr  @xcite , appropriate for glueball spectroscopy , where @xmath31 shows a broad @xmath32 , a narrow @xmath33 and still unexplained structure possibly associated with @xmath34 , a glueball candidate .",
    "the study of @xmath11 = hadrons , e.g. @xmath35 and @xmath36 to name two channels among many , has not been studied above isr energies , but cdf is a perfect place to do it and hopefully it will be done  @xcite .    at the lhc @xmath27 can reach @xmath37 700 gev , into the electroweak sector , and we can have @xmath38 , slepton pairs @xmath39 , etc . measuring the forward protons after 120 m of 8 t dipoles , in association with the central event , as the fp420  @xcite proponents hope to do at atlas and cms , one can measure @xmath27 with @xmath40 2 gev per event  @xcite , and for a state such as @xmath41 , also its width if @xmath42 3 gev / c@xmath43 .",
    "there are scenarios ( e.g. susy ) in which fp420 could provide unique measurements , e.g. if there are two nearby states both decaying to @xmath44 or to @xmath45 .",
    "the quantum numbers of @xmath11 are @xmath46 or @xmath47 ( and these are distinguishable ) for @xmath48 production .",
    "two - photon collisions @xmath49 become important at the lhc thanks to the intense high momentum photons , orders of magnitude more than at the tevatron , giving @xmath50 fb for @xmath45 as a continuum background to @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 does not have this background .    while there is a gold mine of physics in @xmath53 at the lhc , we need to show that ( a ) the cross sections are within reach , and ( b ) one can build the spectrometers with resolution @xmath54 2 gev / c@xmath43 and calibrate their momentum scale _ and resolution _ , to measure @xmath55 , and perhaps to distinguish nearby states .",
    "both these issues are addressed by cdf in a `` tev4lhc '' spirit , and they are also very interesting in their own right .",
    "the calculation of cross sections ( e.g.  @xcite ) involves , in addition to @xmath56 , the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath57 , rapidity gap survival probability ( no other parton interactions ) , and the sudakov factor ( probability of no gluon radiation producing hadrons ) .",
    "the durham group predicts @xmath58 for @xmath59 at the lhc = 3@xmath60 fb . at the tevatron",
    "@xmath61 is out of reach , but the process @xmath62 is identical as far as qcd is concerned , as is @xmath63 .",
    "measuring these constrains the @xmath64 cross section .",
    "in cdf we have looked for both exclusive @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite , without however having detectors able to see the @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "instead we added forward calorimeters ( @xmath67 ) and beam shower counters bsc ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "if these are all empty there is a high probability that both @xmath65 and @xmath66 escaped intact with small @xmath69 .",
    "we also measured  @xcite exclusive dijets .",
    "for the exclusive @xmath6 search we triggered on events with two electromagnetic ( @xmath70 ) clusters with @xmath71 4 gev in the central calorimeter , with a veto on signals in the bsc",
    ". this killed pile - up events and enabled us to take data without prescaling the trigger .",
    "we required all other detectors to be consistent with only noise ; then our _ effective _ luminosity is only about 10% of the delivered luminosity .",
    "we found  @xcite 3 events with exactly two back - to - back @xmath70-showers ( assumed to be photons ) with @xmath72 10 gev / c@xmath43 . from wire proportional chambers at the shower maximum we concluded that two were perfect @xmath73 candidates and one was also consistent with being a @xmath74 event .",
    "the durham prediction  @xcite was 0.8@xmath60 events , clearly consistent .",
    "we have since accumulated more data , with a lower threshold , now being analysed .    with the above trigger we also found  @xcite 16 @xmath75 events , with @xmath76 10 gev / c@xmath43 ( up to 38 gev / c@xmath43 ) , the qed @xmath77 process  @xcite .",
    "exclusive 2-photon processes had not previously been observed in hadron - hadron collisions ; the cross section agrees with the precise theory prediction .",
    "this process has been suggested as a means of calibrating the lhc luminosity ; then it must be done in the presence of pile - up , and one will need to know the acceptance etc .",
    "at the few % level .",
    "more interesting for fp420 is that measurement of an exclusive lepton pair gives both forward proton momenta , with a precision dominated by the incoming beam momentum spread ( @xmath78 , or 700 mev ) .",
    "one can do this with pile - up , selecting dileptons with no associated tracks on the @xmath79 vertex and @xmath80 .",
    "one can also cut on @xmath81 ( correlated with @xmath82 ) , but @xmath82 has better resolution . in cdf",
    "we found that a cut @xmath83 rads is suitable for qed - produced pairs .",
    "for each pair one can predict @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and , if a proton is in the fp420 acceptance , compare @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this can also possibly map the acceptance a(@xmath880 ) , as the cross section shape is known from qed , and the ( coulomb ) protons have very small @xmath12 .",
    "cdf also used a `` muon+track '' trigger , again with bsc veto , to study @xmath90 with 3 gev / c@xmath914 gev / c@xmath43 .",
    "this is a very rich region , with the @xmath92 and @xmath89 vector mesons that can only be produced exclusively by photoproduction @xmath93 , or possibly by odderon exchange : @xmath94 .",
    "we know what to expect for photoproduction from hera , so an excess would be evidence for the elusive @xmath26 .",
    "the spectrum  @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massmumu ] , together with the sum of three components : the vector mesons and a continuum , @xmath95 , which is again consistent with qed .",
    "these central exclusive spectra are exceptionally clean ; in fact the biggest background ( @xmath37 10% ) is the identical process but with an undetected @xmath96 dissociation .",
    "the @xmath92 and @xmath89 cross sections @xmath97 , are ( 3.92@xmath980.62)nb and ( 0.54@xmath980.15)nb , agreeing with expectations  @xcite .",
    "thus we do not have evidence for @xmath26 exchange , and put a limit @xmath99 ( 95% c.l . ) , compared with a theory prediction  @xcite 0.3 - 0.6 .",
    "while the qed and photoproduction processes in fig .  [ fig : massmumu ] should hold no surprises , their agreement with expectations validates the analysis .",
    "we required no @xmath70 tower with @xmath100 80 mev .",
    "if we allow such signals ( essentially @xmath16 s ) the number of @xmath92 events jumps from 286 to 352 , while the number of @xmath89 only increases from 39 to 40 . the spectrum of em showers is shown in fig .  [ fig : photon ] .",
    "these extra @xmath92 events are very consistent with being @xmath101 , from @xmath102 , with about 20% of the @xmath16 being not detected ( giving a background of 4% under the exclusive @xmath92 ) .",
    "we measure @xmath103 = ( 75@xmath9814)nb .",
    "the existence of this process implies that @xmath59 must happen at the lhc ( assuming @xmath41 exists ) , as the qcd physics is qualitatively identical .",
    "the @xmath5 cross section agrees with predictions : 150nb  @xcite and 130@xmath104nb  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore likely that @xmath105 is of order 0.5 - 5 fb , within reach of fp420 . in susy models",
    "the cross section can be much higher  @xcite .",
    "spectrum of electromagnetic showers associated with @xmath92 , together with an empirical function to estimate the fraction under the 80 mev cut .",
    "these are @xmath106 candidates .",
    "[ fig : photon ] , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we are looking for @xmath107 ( by photoproduction , or by @xmath108 ) , and @xmath109 .",
    "the @xmath110 should be measurable in the presence of pile - up using @xmath111 , @xmath82 and @xmath112 cuts ( @xmath113 is the number of additional tracks on the dilepton vertex ) .",
    "we have candidate events , with the @xmath114 and @xmath115 states resolved ; cross sections are now being determined .",
    "the @xmath116 probably can not be studied in the presence of pile - up , and it is challenging .",
    "we have also made a search  @xcite for exclusive @xmath19 , allowed only through photoproduction : @xmath117 . in the standard model the ( integrated ) cross section at the tevatron is too small to see , @xmath118 = 0.3fb  @xcite or 1.3fb  @xcite , before branching fractions . in white s pomeron theory",
    "@xcite the cross section is expected to be much larger , but a quantitative prediction is lacking .",
    "our search uses both @xmath119 and @xmath1 pairs with @xmath120 40 gev / c@xmath43 .",
    "there are 8 exclusive candidates with @xmath121 pb ( for @xmath122 4.0 ) , agreeing with @xmath123(qed ) = 0.256 pb . all the events have @xmath124 0.013(rad ) and @xmath125 1.2 gev / c .",
    "only one event had a @xmath66 in the acceptance of the roman pots when they were operational , and a track was observed , showing that the event was exclusive , and that at the lhc such @xmath126 events will be available for calibration .",
    "if we remove the requirement that the bsc should be empty there are 4 additional events , interpreted as @xmath127 dissocation .",
    "one of them has @xmath128 and a larger @xmath82 and @xmath112 than the others , but we can not claim it to be truly exclusive .",
    "we put a limit on exclusive @xmath129 0.96 pb at 95% c.l .",
    "clearly it will be interesting to look for exclusive @xmath130 at the lhc .",
    "in early running of the lhc , when bunch crossings without pile - up are not yet rare , it is important to measure these exclusive processes , to the extent possible without complete forward coverage . in cms",
    "we have plans to add forward shower counters  @xcite around the beam pipe to help tag rapidity gaps , together with the zdc and forward hadron calorimeters . with large forward gaps in both directions , a trigger on two em showers with @xmath71 4 gev should be possible , hopefully observing @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .",
    "clean single interactions are surely needed needed for the @xmath134 and @xmath132 ; both channels are excellent tests of @xmath59 .",
    "one may even hope that when exclusive higgs production is measured , the coupling @xmath135 can be derived by comparing the three cross sections !",
