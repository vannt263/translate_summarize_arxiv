    "silicon is a promising lens material for millimeter wavelength observations because it can be machined ; it has a high index of refraction , which is optically advantageous ; and it has a high thermal conductivity , allowing for straightforward cooling of the lenses to cryogenic temperatures .",
    "however , the high index ( @xmath0 ) in the submillimeter region@xcite leads to a reflection at each silicon / vacuum interface of approximately @xmath1 ^ 2\\approx30\\%$ ] per surface .",
    "this is prohibitively large , especially for multi - lens cameras .",
    "nevertheless , the benefits of silicon have motivated the development of antireflection coatings , @xcite where the referenced ar solutions are in ir and thus easier than mm - wave bands due to the thickness of the ar layer .",
    "this paper details the development and testing of a simple antireflection coating that reduces reflection to @xmath2 per lens at the design wavelength while maintaining @xmath3 transmission at @xmath4 300ghz .    at a fixed wavelength",
    "the ideal , normal - incidence antireflection coating for a substrate of index @xmath5 in vacuum has an index of refraction of @xmath6 and is @xmath7 thick . in our application",
    ", we are building lenses for the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) camera@xcite at 145 , 217 , and 265ghz to measure the fine scale anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background . in the following ,",
    "we focus on the 150ghz band , for which the ideal antireflection coating has @xmath8 m and index @xmath9 .",
    "the coating is a machined piece of cirlex^^ @xcite polyimide glued to silicon with stycast^^ 1266 epoxy @xcite and lord ap-134 adhesion promoter@xcite . for the curved lens surface ,",
    "a piece of cirlex approximately 1 cm thick is machined to the curved shape and then held in a teflon gluing jig shaped to match the lens surface while the epoxy cures .",
    "the low - frequency ( @xmath10khz ) dielectric constant and loss reported in the kapton polyimide data sheet@xcite suggest that polyimide and silicon could be combined in an ar configuration . to ensure accurate modeling and to test sample dependent effects",
    ", we measured the dielectric properties with fourier transform spectrometers ( fts ) , summarized in table  [ matprop ] .    * *    .dielectric properties of the materials for ar coating.[matprop ] [ cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      of the coated 4mm - thick silicon flat ( flat 7 ) , both modeled ( black ) and measured on the fts ( gray ) .",
    "the measurement is the ratio of a sample to a reference spectrum .",
    "the lower curve shows that the difference ( measurement minus model ) is within 5% of zero through the well - measured range .",
    "the high transmission near 133 and 400ghz is due to the ar coating being @xmath11 and @xmath12 thick .",
    "the slow reduction in @xmath13 with increasing frequency is due to increasing loss in the coating and glue .",
    "this sample was made before precise values of the index of cirlex and stycast 1266 were known .",
    "thus , the center of the passband window , 133ghz , is 15ghz below our target frequency . ]    rather than trying to interpret the lens results , we measured the transmission of the two coated flats labeled flat 6 and 7 in table  [ befafter ] . figure  [ data ] shows the transmission spectra for one of these samples along with a model .",
    "the measurement is the ratio of a sample to a reference spectrum , which are averages over two and six spectra , respectively .",
    "the model is _ not _ a fit to the coated transmission data but is determined instead by the cirlex , stycast , and silicon properties given in table  [ matprop ] and by measurements of the component thicknesses .",
    "the one exception is the silicon loss .",
    "the coated flats have somewhat lower resistivity ( between 1300 and @xmath14-cm , as measured by the vendor ) than the uncoated silicon samples ( all specified to exceed @xmath15-cm ) ; both sets have poorly constrained @xmath16 . to handle the uncertain silicon loss ,",
    "we have treated the resistivity of the sample as an unknown and varied it to fit the measured transmission .",
    "a finished design of a silicon antireflection coating for any application requires a complete model of the system .",
    "incident angle range , frequency bandwidth , and polarization all affect the optimal coating thickness . it is helpful to begin the process with a few estimates and approximate guidelines , however , and we offer some here . first , using equation  [ dielconst ] and recalling that power loss is one @xmath17 per radian of phase , we find that absorption loss in 10k@xmath18-cm silicon should equal 1% per centimeter , scaling as @xmath19 .    for normally incident light , the best ar - coating thickness @xmath20 can be estimated by requiring that the optical path through both materials ( coating and glue ) equal one - quarter wave .",
    "that is , @xmath21 comparing this rule against the calculated reflection , we find that it overestimates the optimal ar thickness @xmath20 by approximately @xmath22 m for a glue layer @xmath23 m thick .",
    "the difference increases quadratically with glue thickness , but the approximate expression is adequate for any reasonable size of the glue layer .",
    "m of glue and enough cirlex so that @xmath24 equals one - quarter of the vacuum wavelength .",
    "solid lines indicate normal incidence ; dashed lines are for @xmath25 incident angle . the lines labeled _ a5 _ and _ a20 _",
    "show the absorption loss .",
    "the _ r20 _",
    "lines give the reflection from the 20 mm lens ; the results are not visibly different for reflection from the 5 mm lens .",
    "absorption increases for oblique angles and at higher frequencies .",
    "we show the expected loss at room temperature in 5000@xmath18-cm silicon .",
    "cryogenically , absorption loss should be reduced . ]",
    "figure  [ fig.estimate ] shows the predicted absorption and reflection loss calculated for a pair of realistic coated lenses , both at @xmath26 and @xmath25 incident angles .",
    "the model assumes lenses made of 5000@xmath18-cm silicon , 5 or 20 mm thick , and unpolarized light . over most of the frequency range",
    "it should be possible to achieve better than 2% reflection per lens and less than 10% absorption particularly if the lens is thin or silicon resistivity is greater than the @xmath27-cm assumed here .",
    "it might be possible to use the stycast  1266 alone as an ar coating .",
    "its index of 1.68 is lower than the ideal 1.85 , and the loss is approximately double the loss of cirlex .",
    "however , cutting a single mold to shape the curing epoxy saves three machining steps when compared with the method for cutting cirlex coatings described in this article . at 150 and 300ghz ,",
    "the optimal stycast thickness are 300 and 140@xmath28 m , which offer transmission of 90% and 88% , respectively .",
    "this compares unfavorably with the 95% and 93% transmission offered by a cirlex - coated lens .",
    "the stycast - coated lens would reflect approximately 1.5% in both frequencies , three times the reflection expected from a cirlex - coated lens .",
    "still , a simpler stycast - only coating might suffice in some applications if the thickness and shape could be controlled well enough .",
    "we have developed and tested a technique for antireflection coating silicon lenses at cryogenic temperatures at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "flat samples show @xmath29 1.5% reflection and @xmath30 92% transmission at the design frequency .",
    "the remaining 6.5% is attributable to absorption loss , which will decrease upon cooling .",
    "the authors are very grateful to john ruhl for sharing his fourier transform spectrometer and to norm jarosik for operating a vector network analyzer .",
    "we thank the princeton university physics department machine shop , especially glenn atkinson , for developing techniques to machine and glue the cirlex coatings .",
    "sarah marriage tested different ways of gluing silicon to polyimide ; ted gudmundsen and adrian liu repeatedly cycled coated silicon samples between 77 and 300k .",
    "we are grateful to our colleagues on the act collaboration and to asad aboobaker , andrew bocarsly , mark devlin , simon dicker , phil farese , jeff klein , jeff mcmahon , amber miller , mike niemack , suzanne staggs , and zachary staniszewski for many helpful discussions .",
