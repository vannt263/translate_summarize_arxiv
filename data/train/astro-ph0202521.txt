    "stephan s quintet ( sq ) was discovered in 1877 and is one of the most popular and studied groups of galaxies .",
    "it is classified as a compact group ( hcg 92 ) in the hickson ( 1982 ) catalog .",
    "the core of the group is formed by three galaxies ( ngc  7319 , ngc  7318a , and ngc  7317 ) , which have recessional velocities @xmath6 6600 km s@xmath5 with very low velocity dispersions .",
    "the other members of the group are ngc  7318b , at @xmath6 5700 km s@xmath5 , and ngc  7320 at @xmath6800 km s@xmath5 . according to the orthodox view",
    ", ngc  7320 is a foreground galaxy , while ngc  7318b which has a difference in velocity of @xmath61000 km s@xmath5 with respect to the core of the group , shows clear signs of strong distortions which indicate ongoing interaction with the group .",
    "two other galaxies ngc  7320c ( @xmath6 6000 km s@xmath5 ) and ngc  7331 ( @xmath6 800 km s@xmath5 ) are not considered in the hickson scheme as members of the group , but their apparent proximity and several reasons that we will discuss in this paper make it convenient to consider them here . a diagram showing the relative positions of the galaxies in the sq and ngc  7331 can be found in moles , sulentic , & marquez ( 1997 ) .    in spite of the large observational effort dedicated to the study of sq from the radio to the x ray continuum",
    ", there are many points which yet require further attention . in particular , in this paper",
    "we address the following specific questions : _ i _ ) whether the apparent proximity of ngc  7320 to the other members of sq is merely a projection effect ; _ ii _ ) whether there is any evidence of interaction between sq ( specifically ngc  7320 ) and ngc  7331 that could explain the particular kinematics of this galaxy ( prada et al .",
    "1996 ) ; and _ iii _ ) whether the core of sq ( ngc  7318a , ngc  7318b and ngc  7319 ) is connected with ngc  7320c .",
    "we have tried to answer these questions by conducting an observational program of broad- and narrow - band imaging .",
    "the narrow - band h@xmath1 images analyzed in this paper cover velocities in the range 08000 km s@xmath5 , while the broad - band @xmath0 observations correspond to two different regions : the south part of ngc7331 and sq respectively , covering a total area @xmath6650 square arcminutes . with the @xmath0 images we have investigated the possible presence of bridges between ngc  7331 and sq , and with the narrow - band observations we have mapped the h@xmath1 and derived a map with the velocity field of this emission in sq .",
    "section  2 of this paper summarizes our present knowledge and previous observations of sq .",
    "section  3 presents the observations and data processing . in sections  4 and 5",
    "we analyze the broad- and narrow - band images , respectively .",
    "section  6 discusses our results in the context of earlier observations .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 7 .",

    "( 2001 ) have recently claimed the discovery of a large number of young star clusters at distances up to 20 kpc from the galactic center in the tidal debris of ngc  7319 .",
    "this is in agreement with the standard dynamical picture ( moles , marquez , & sulentic 1998 ) , in which the ongoing interaction with ngc  7319 is older than that occurring now between ngc  7318a and ngc  7318b .",
    "ohyama et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have discovered two emission - line regions in the tidal arm of ngc  7318b in a position which coincides with previously discovered radio continuum emission .",
    "the lines in these two region are at 6560 and 6720 km s@xmath5 , respectively , and much wider ( 900 km s@xmath5 ) than the normal h  ii regions in ngc 7318b and ngc 7319 . from this , and from the the ratio between the s  ii and the h@xmath1 emission , they conclude that the emission is the remnant of a large number of recent supernovae .",
    "plana et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have presented h@xmath1 observations in sq with a fabry ",
    "perot interferometer . from these",
    ", they have detected and derived the velocities for 23 h@xmath1 regions with velocities in the range 55406700 km s@xmath5 .",
    "mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and iglesias - pramo & vlchez ( 2001 ) have recently presented evidence that some of this emission corresponds to dwarf galaxies located within tidal tails in the sq .",
    "yun et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have demonstrated that sq is deficient in molecular gas .",
    "co emission is detected only in ngc 7319 and is concentrated mostly in a region 8 kpc north of the center of the galaxy .",
    "this asymmetry could be produced by recent tidal disruptions .",
    "however gao & xu ( 2000 ) , using bima , have detected a larger abundance of co in ngc 7319 , and also in ngc 7318b and the intergroup starburst region .",
    "finally , smith & struck ( 2001 ) have detected co in a tail located to the north of sq at 6000 and 6700 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this emission has h  i and h@xmath1 counterparts , and the velocities suggest that this gas corresponds to material removed from ngc 7318b and ngc 7319 .    the iras data ( yun et al .",
    "1997 ) show that the far - infrared emission in sq is more extended than in other groups and is remarkably similar to the x - ray emission ( see below ) .",
    "this could indicate the presence of warm dust in the intragroupo gas .",
    "kaftan - kassim & sulentic ( 1974 ) observed the radio continuum at 318 , 430 , and 606 mhz and built a map of the emission which shows a connection between ngc  7331 and the source 4c33.56 across sq .",
    "however von kap - herr , haslam , & wielebinski ( 1977 ) observed the same region at 2695 mhz and found no evidence of such a connection .",
    "allen & sullivan ( 1980 ) observed in the sq region the 21 cm h  i at 750 km s@xmath5 and 6700 km s@xmath5 and concluded that the low redshift h  i is entirely associated with ngc  7320 , and that the high - redshift h  i is concentrated in the range 65706630 km s@xmath5 .",
    "however , sulentic & arp ( 1983 ) have measured the neutral hydrogen at low velocity ( @xmath7 km s@xmath5 ) and found that it is displaced from the optical position of ngc  7320 ; they argued that this has been produced by interaction between ngc  7320 and the other members of sq .",
    "peterson & shostak ( 1980 ) have observed several positions of the 21 cm line in the inner and outer parts of sq and found three extended systems at velocities 5700 , 6000 , and 6600 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the galaxies are enveloped by a cloud of h  i with a size of @xmath6 100 kpc ( sullivan 1980 ; peterson & shostak 1980 ) .",
    "shostak , sullivan & allen ( 1984 ) mapped the h  i line in the region of sq with a resolution of 35@xmath8 .",
    "they built a map of the gas with resolution of 50 km s@xmath5 and confirmed the existence of three systems at velocities 5700 , 6000 , and 6600 km s@xmath5 .",
    "most of the emission comes from the outer parts of the galaxies .",
    "the authors argued that the stripping of gas from the disks is due to a tidal encounter in the past and a present collision .",
    "gillespie ( 1974 , 1977 ) have found several radio sources @xmath6 15 arcminutes to the north of sq . however , the most probable interpretation is a group of radio sources at @xmath9 0.5 without any relation with sq .",
    "x - ray emission in sq was detected ( bahcall , harris , & rood 1984 ) by the _",
    "einstein observatory_. other more recent observations have been obtained with _ rosat _",
    "( sulentic , pietsch , & arp 1995 ; pietsch et al .",
    "1997 ) , and _ asca _ ( awaki et al . 1997 ) .",
    "pietsch et al . ( 1997 ) obtained high spatial resolution x - ray images of sq with the _ rosat _ hri detector .",
    "this tidal emission amounts to @xmath10 erg s@xmath5 and is distributed among the following components : @xmath11 ) the galaxies ngc 7319 and ngc 7318a , @xmath12 ) the intergalactic feature between ngc 7319 and ngc 7318b , @xmath13 ) a region situated @xmath14 to the north of ngc  7318a , b , and @xmath15 ) diffuse hot gas ( amounting to one third of the total emission ) .",
    "the discrepant redshift of ngc  7320 has received special attention in the past . in the orthodox view , this is just a chance projection similar to those found in a large numbers of hickson compact groups . however , some authors ( arp 1973 ; burbidge & burbidge 1961 ; sulentic & arp 1983 ) have claimed the existence of a physical connection between the low- and high - redshift galaxies of sq .",
    "this claim is based on statistical arguments or on the numerous signs of distortions found in optical , ir and radio images of sq .",
    "recently , the _ hubble space telescope _ has obtained images of sq with high resolution ( see http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0010/26hststephen ) .",
    "it has been claimed ( moles 2001 ) that these images have definitely solved the question of the redshift discrepancy of ngc  7320 because it is possible to resolve individual stars in this galaxy , showing that it is closer than the rest of the galaxies of the group",
    ". however , arp ( 2001 ) ( private comm . ) , in strong disagreement with this , claims that in these images it is also possible to resolve individual stars in the high - redshift members of the group . furthermore , using the luminosity of the h  ii region as a distance indicator , arp ( 2001 ) ( private comm . ) points out that the low- and high - redshift galaxies of sq should be at the same distance .    the other relevant fact in the discussion on sq is the large difference in velocity ( @xmath16 km s@xmath5 ) between ngc  7318b and the rest of the high-@xmath17 members of sq .",
    "moles et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argue that ngc  7318b is crossing the group now ; as this galaxy has kept its gas , this current crossing should be occurring for the first time . as a consequence of this encounter , the interstellar medium of ngc  7318b is shocking the intragroup medium , especially in the northern starburst forming ( nsf ) region ( gallagher et al .",
    "2001 ) and in the tidal tail of ngc  7319 . as is expected from numerical simulations and as an increasing number of observations show , this interaction is producing intense starbursts in several regions of the group .",
    "there are several features indicating that this interaction is in fact in progress ; for instance : _ i _ ) optically , ngc  7318a and ngc  7318b look like a typical pair merging , _ ii _ ) there is radio emission associated with the interaction between ngc  7319 and ngc  7318b , and _ iii _ )",
    "a large number of knots has been observed in the arms of ngc  7318b .",
    "however , arp ( 1973 ) has suggested that with this difference in velocities the group would dissipate over a very short timescale so that it would be very unlikely to see them together .    in the standard picture ( moles et al .",
    "1998 ) , ngc  7320c crossed the group 10@xmath18 years ago producing considerable disruptions ; for instance , it removed the h  i in ngc  7319 creating a visible tail seen today in this galaxy , with part of the gas being deposited in a region northeast of ngc  7319 .",
    "the interaction was also probably responsible for the seyfert 2-type nuclear activity of ngc  7319 . in this paper , we will show more evidence of the connection between ngc  7320c and the other galaxies in sq .",

    "however , the structures that we wanted to map were diffuse and spatially very extended , so we binned the images to a resolution @xmath6 2.5 arcsecs , this permits an enhancement of the signal - to - noise ratio by a factor @xmath67 , that is , we go almost two magnitudes deeper , being now the 3-@xmath4 limiting magnitude 27.3 mag / arcsec@xmath3 . figures 1@xmath25 present the gray - scale and isophotal map obtained around sq and in the southern part of ngc  7331 respectively .",
    "figure 1@xmath11 shows that the halo is considerable more extended that it was revealed in the observations by moles et al .",
    "for the first time , we have found evidence of a clear connection in the form of diffuse light between sq and the galaxy ngc  7320c .",
    "in particular the sw tail which emerges from sq seems to extend to this galaxy .",
    "we think that this supports the previously suspected connection between sq and ngc  7320c .",
    "we have traced the emission up to the isophote at 26.7 mag / arcsec@xmath3 and 25.5 mag / arcsec@xmath3 around the sq and ngc  7331 respectively .",
    "the 25.5 mag / arcsec@xmath3 isophote surrounds and seems to enclose ngc  7331 .",
    "these numbers are conservative with respect to the sensitivity of the image and take into account the uncertainties in the estimation of the sky level , particularly difficult in the observations of the region around ngc  7331 .",
    "there are no signs of past or present interaction in the form of tails , bridges , etc .",
    ", between sq and ngc  7331 .",
    "we would remark that the last isophote surrounding sq is not associated with any individual galaxy , but instead corresponds to the diffuse halo of the group , while the last isophote detected around ngc  7331 is more regular , roughly following the shape of the galaxy , and seems to be associated with the disk ( and halo ) of this galaxy .",
    "to differentiate the emission coming from the low - z ( at the systemic velocity of ngc  7320 ) and high - z ( the other galaxies of sq ) respectively , we decided to take h@xmath1 images redshifted at the velocities of both components ( see section  3 ) .",
    "figure  2 presents the @xmath0 band ( gray - scale ) and the total h@xmath1 ( contours ) .",
    "the h@xmath1 maps presented here are a combination of the emission associated with the low- and high-@xmath17 components . to enhance the signal with respect to the noise we binned the data to a common pixel size of 1.06 arcsec ; this produces a slight degradation in resolution .",
    "there are many spurious h@xmath1 features associated with residuals due to imperfect continuum subtraction in the stars of the field . in general",
    ", there is no ambiguity in distinguishing between these residuals and real h@xmath1 emission because the latter is specifically associated with several extended features that we discuss below .",
    "figure 3 presents the images in the narrow filters observed combining the h@xmath1 low-@xmath17 ( contours ) and high-@xmath17 ( gray - scale ) filters , respectively .",
    "the size of the images is @xmath26 arcmin@xmath3 . from these images ,",
    "it is clear that the low-@xmath17 emission is associated with ngc  7320 .",
    "the high-@xmath17 emission is concentrated in three well differentiated structures : @xmath27 ) the center of ngc  7319 , @xmath28 ) an intergroup feature in the ns direction between ngc  7318b and ngc  7319 , and @xmath29 ) a structure to the north of the aforementioned feature , which corresponds to features previously identified by xu , sulentic , & tuffs ( 1999 ) and gallagher et al .",
    "apart from these components , there are several other high-@xmath17 h@xmath1 features in the tidal tails produced by the strong interaction within the group . from fig .  3",
    ", we see that the low- and high-@xmath17 emission are associated with different spatial regions , and that there are no regions in which both types of emission overlap .",
    "although our spatial resolution is poor and the h@xmath1 emission is diffuse , using the algorithm sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and eliminating the spurious detections associated with star residuals , we identified about 20 and 30 separated regions in the low- and high-@xmath17 maps , respectively .",
    "the low-@xmath17 structures are symmetrically distributed in the disk of ngc  7320 ( see however section  6.1 ) and tend to be isolated and compact .",
    "the high-@xmath17 emission tends to be more diffuse than the low-@xmath17 component .",
    "this is in agreement with the standard picture in which components @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see above ) of the high-@xmath17 emission are associated with the intergroup medium formed by material stripped by recent and ongoing strong interaction involving the galaxies ngc  7318a , ngc  7318b , ngc  7319 , and ngc  7320c .",
    "we may consider the set of h@xmath1 images as a two - dimensional spectrum with very low resolution .",
    "it then makes sense to compute the centroid and dispersion of a given feature . from this",
    ", it is straightforward to produce a two - dimensional velocity map .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "a single wavelength , @xmath30 , was assigned to the @xmath27th pixel of the ]    where @xmath31 the flux in pixel @xmath27 and filter @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the central wavelength in pixel @xmath27 . to eliminate most of the residuals due to stars , only fluxes at a level above 2@xmath4 were considered . from this , we computed the associated velocity as @xmath34 ( @xmath35  ) .",
    "figures  4@xmath11 and @xmath12 show the velocity and the associated error map , respectively .",
    "overplotted in fig .",
    "4@xmath11 is the ellipse which fits the outer isophote of ngc  7320 in the @xmath0-band .",
    "an important result is that the velocities derived are in two well separated ranges : one from 5500 to 7500 km s@xmath5 , and the other from 700 to 1000 km s@xmath5 .",
    "no features at intermediate velocities that could suggest a doppler redshift as the origin of the difference in velocities between ngc  7320 and the rest of the sq have been detected .",
    "however , some points concerning the relationship between these two features are unexplained and are discussed in next section .",
    "the relation between ngc  7331 and ngc  7320 is clear according to their relative positions and systemic velocities . from the h",
    "i line the difference in velocities between both galaxies is @xmath36 km s@xmath5 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "their projected separation is @xmath37 kpc , and the magnitudes in the @xmath38 band are 9.38 and 13.56 for ngc  7331 and ngc  7320 , respectively .",
    "these allow us to classify ngc  7320 as a satellite of ngc  7331 according to the criteria defined by zaritsky et al .",
    "we have searched the ned for objects at less than 500 kpc from ngc  7331 and with recessional velocities similar to that of this galaxy and found another two galaxies besides ngc 7320 .",
    "these galaxies seem to constitute one of the loose groups identified by trasarti - battistoni ( 1998 ) . at angular distances @xmath39 degree ( @xmath40 mpc ) from sq , there are about ten other galaxies with measured redshifts and with recessional velocities in the range 55007500 km s@xmath5 ; they form another loose group with 9 members identified by trasarti - battistoni ( 1998 ) ; a subgroup of such galaxies ( ngc7335 , ngc7337 , and ngc7340 ) at the east of ngc7331 has been classified as a poor cluster by white et al . ( 1999 ) .",
    "one of the mechanisms proposed to explain the counter - rotating core found in ngc  7331 ( prada et al .",
    "1996 ) is the interaction of this galaxy with a small satellite .",
    "although this could really be the origin of such kinematics , in our deep @xmath0 images we have found no evidence ( bridges , tails , etc . ) to @xmath41 mag / arcsec@xmath3 supporting such an interaction between ngc  7331 and ngc  7320 .",
    "we have carried out a comparative study between the features detected in our velocity map and the results by plana et al .",
    "the position of these common h@xmath1 regions is indicated in fig .",
    "we have indicated also in the figure two features in one of the tails connecting ngc  7320c with the rest of sq .",
    "the comparison with the results by plana et al .",
    "( 1999 ) shows that we have detected and estimated the velocities of the regions detected by these authors ( the detection of region number 23 it is not completely clear in our data ) , although we have found a systematic difference of @xmath42 km s@xmath5 in the estimated velocities .",
    "this is consistent with the uncertainties expected from the typical width of the h@xmath1 filters used in our analysis . in table  2",
    "we present our estimate of the velocities of h@xmath1 regions detected by plana et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( we have adopted the notation used by these authors ) .",
    "this uncertainty is too large to distinguish between the components associated with ngc  7319 and the other three galaxies ( ngc  7318a , ngc  7318b , and ngc  7317 ) , but is small enough to distinguish between emission associated with the above four galaxies and ngc  7320 . due to the technique used , in some cases",
    "plana et al .",
    "( 1999 ) were not able to measured unambiguously the velocities , so our observations represent the first determination of such velocities .",
    "our analysis allows us to distinguish only one component in velocity in each position .",
    "if there were more than one , this should reveal itself in our velocity map as an increase in the pixel - to - pixel rms according to the importance of one or other component .",
    "this seems to be the case for region 13 ( in the notation of plana et al .",
    "1999 ) in which these authors detected two different components , and which shows up in our map as a large variation in velocity from pixel to pixel .",
    ".recessional velocities ( in km s@xmath5 ) of the h@xmath1 regions in common with plana et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     some of these features are in the tidal tails resulting from the strong interaction within the group .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the results of iglesias - pramo & vlchez ( 2001 ) , who identified these features as dwarf galaxies .",
    "the above results are also in agreement with the predictions from numerical simulations ( barnes 1988 ) in which dwarf galaxies can form in tidal tails resulting from the interaction of two disk galaxies .",
    "our broad - band observations reveal a bigger halo that was previously observed . as pointed out by moles et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , this light is not associated with the individual galaxies , but is instead diffuse light associated with present and past interactions within the group . in particular it indicates large transversal motions of ngc  7317 and ngc  7320c .",
    "the interaction with this galaxy seems to be responsible for the diffuse light observed to the north of sq .",
    "the extension of the sw tail to ngc  7320c strongly supports the standard scenario proposed by moles et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , in which the galaxy crossed sq and created this tail , which runs in parallel to a second tail which emerges from one of the arms of ngc  7319 . this second tail is brighter as it would be expected if it corresponds to a past encounter with the core from which most of the gas associated with ngc  7319 ( and partially with ngc  7320c ) was stripped .",
    "apart from all the positive facts which suggest that ngc 7320 is unrelated to the rest of the components of sq , as we have argued above , there is one further observational aspect whose interpretation is not clear in the light of the orthodox view : there is an h@xmath43 bridge ( see figs . 3 , 4@xmath11 and 4@xmath13 ) which is a continuation of the intergalactic gas of the high - redshift galaxies of sq pointing to ngc  7320 and extending throughout this galaxy .",
    "in particular , we would like to remark :    * the emission of h@xmath43 at 6500 km / s is in a region of ngc7320 where there is no emission of h@xmath43 at 800 km / s .",
    "assuming elliptical symmetry for ngc 7320 ( such symmetry exists in the @xmath0-band ) , we would expect to observe h@xmath43 emission with both velocities ( 6500 km s@xmath5 and 800 km s@xmath5 ) superposed in the region of the bridge . instead of that",

    "these coincidences could be explained naturally if a bridge at 6500 km / s were in front of the galaxy at 800 km / s .",
