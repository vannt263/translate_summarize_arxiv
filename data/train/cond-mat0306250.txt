    "the complete phase diagram of the high temperature superconducting ( htsc ) cuprates is not yet known . while there is universal agreement on the presence of an antiferromagnetic phase at low doping and a superconducting region with a maximum @xmath12 at a doping level of @xmath10 holes per copper site at higher doping ,",
    "there is considerable uncertainty about the nature of the _ normal state _ outside the superconducting phase , particularly in the overdoped region .",
    "it has been clear from the beginning of the study of htsc materials that their normal state is highly anomalous and not at all like the fermi - liquid state of the conventional superconductors .",
    "three features stand out .",
    "first , at high temperature , the resistivity and the optical reflectance are dominated by scattering processes with a linear variation of the scattering rate with frequency and temperature where @xmath13.@xcite experimentally , these processes manifest themselves as a dc resistivity that varies linearly with temperature with a zero intercept on the temperature axis@xcite and an infrared reflectance that varies linearly with frequency over a very wide range of frequencies , well into to the midinfrared.@xcite this singular behavior of the scattering rate has been termed marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) behavior from the original postulate of varma _ et al . _",
    "@xcite where it was assumed that the quasiparticle weight vanished logarithmically at the fermi surface , and the green s function of the carriers was entirely incoherent .",
    "the second anomalous feature of the normal state is the presence of a pseudogap , a depression in the density of states below a temperature @xmath14 that decreases as the doping level @xmath15 is increased.@xcite the pseudogap region on the phase diagram is not well defined and the exact value of @xmath14 depends on the experimental probe used .",

    "we also steer away from the problem of the phase diagram in the overdoped state .",
    "we have chosen bi-2212 for our measurements for several reasons .",
    "first , this material has been widely investigated by the angle resolved photoemission and tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "secondly , large single crystals can be grown and annealed to yield samples spanning the overdoped as well as the underdoped regions of the phase diagram .",

    "we also produce the optical conductivities by using k - k analysis fit them and compare the results with those of reflectance fits .",
    "since the reflectance is related to the scattering rate in a direct way , models where the scattering rate has a simple form , such as the mfl hypothesis , allow us to estimate the coupling constant @xmath21 directly from the reflectance data .    the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we introduce a simple way to extract approximate mfl parameters directly from the reflectance data . secondly , we report indications of deviations from the simple mfl form from the study of accurate 300 k ( bi-2212 ) reflectance data in a wide range of doping levels .",
    "the data presented here focus on the overdoped region where we present new data for several highly overdoped samples ( @xmath22= 82 , 73 , 65 and 60  k ) .",

    "et al._@xcite as mentioned above , we focus on 300  k reflectance data for our analysis , first because we want to avoid the region where the sharp scattering resonance distorts the spectra and secondly because with our measurement technique the data at room temperature are the most accurate .",
    "we used fourier - transform infrared ( ftir ) spectroscopy to obtain the reflectance data of floating zone grown single twinned crystals of bi-2212 . to obtain overdoped samples",
    "the crystals were annealed in 3  kbar liquid oxygen in sealed containers.@xcite a polished stainless steel mirror was used as an intermediate reference to correct for instrumental drifts with time and temperature .",
    "an in - situ evaporated gold film on the sample was the final reflectance reference.@xcite the reflectance of the gold films was in turn calibrated with a polished stainless steel sample where we relied on drude theory and the dc resistivity as the ultimate reference .",

    "we note that the absorption varies linearly with frequency at high frequency for all doping levels and that both the slopes of the curves and their intercepts with the absorption axis decrease with increasing doping .",
    "we also note that the optimally doped reflectance shows best linearity up to high frequency ( see fig .  [ curvature ] ) but still we can use this universal linear trend in the relaxation region as",

    "the intercepts are consistent with the slopes within the mfl hypothesis , except at the high doping range , where we observe a hint of a crossover around @xmath53 .",

    "we see a crossover where is the intercept drops more abruptly , i.e. , the scattering rate drops quickly .",
    "we found another interesting doping dependent trend : a slight deviation from a straight line reflectance in the relaxation region giving rise to a curvature of the reflectance data .",
    "we analyze the curvatures of @xmath34 at various doping levels in the following way : we take two frequency segments , @xmath55  @xmath11 and @xmath56  @xmath11 in the relaxation region .",

    "the additional drude and lorenz oscillators introduced to fit the wider frequency range data should not be taken literally as additional physical channels of conductivity .",
    "they only serve to correct the frequency dependence of the mfl spectrum that is known not to fit well over a wider range of frequencies  @xcite .",
    "we note that as a first approximation , the mfl spectrum of fluctuations accounts for the data well in the low frequency region of @xmath82  @xmath11 both within the simple @xmath34 slope analysis and the more accurate kubo formalism . in fig .  [ together ]",
    "we compare the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath21 from the two different methods of analysis : 1-@xmath83 and kubo - mfl fit ( without oscillators ) .",
    "the coupling constant decreases uniformly with doping except for the highly underdoped samples .",
    "however , in the low doping range the pseudogap temperature @xmath14 may approach our measurement temperature of 300 k. the pseudogap leads to a decreased scattering rate at low frequencies which would in turn lead to an enhanced slope of the absorption curve .",
    "the upturn in the slope at low doping levels may therefore well be a pseudogap effect .",
    "thus , our first conclusion is that at room temperature the coupling constant @xmath21 decreases uniformly in the doping region that we have studied without any evidence of any crossovers .",

    "they calculated the coupling constants by using @xmath84 .",
    "we have augmented their analysis by estimating the coupling constant at room temperature which is lower than their published low - temperature value in the underdoped region .",
    "this is probably due to a rearrangement of spectral weight of the spin - fluctuation spectrum with temperature .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , this rearrangement takes two forms : spectral weight is removed from low frequencies as a result of the development of the spin gap but added to intermediate frequencies with the development of the neutron resonance that couples strongly to the carriers .",
    "the net result is a strong increase in @xmath65 which suggests that spectral weight is removed from high frequencies to fill the neutron mode.@xcite    the overall good agreement of the coupling constant and its doping dependence between the infrared and the arpes data is surprising since the infrared response represents an average over the fermi surface , whereas the arpes data shown in fig .

    "represents corrections to the self energy in the @xmath85 direction . also ,",

    "the effect of the pseudogap on the intercept would be opposite from that on the slope , causing it to be smaller at low doping if there was a pseudogap . instead , as shown in fig .",
    "[ intercept ] , we observe the opposite effect in the underdoped region , the intercept is higher than what would be expected from a uniformly increasing @xmath65 with underdoping .",
    "also , in the highly overdoped region the intercept drops , whereas the slope appears to have a more uniform trend in the 0.16 to 0.22 doping region .",
    "the overall result of these effects is to produce an s - shaped curve centered at optimal doping .",
