    "because of the great distances and extreme faintness of galaxies at @xmath0 , as well as the high sky backgrounds , detection of galaxies at such high redshifts remains extremely challenging .",
    "it is not surprising that the number of robust @xmath3@xmath87 candidates is still very small ( see , e.g. , bouwens & illingworth 2006 ; bouwens et al .  2008 ;",
    "oesch et al .",
    ". gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters has been highlighted as an efficient way of improving this situation , due to the significant areas on the sky behind these clusters with sizeable magnification factors to amplify light from faint sources .",
    "however , this advantage is offset by the greatly reduced source plane volume in the highly magnified regions .    because of the trade - off between depth and area , the utility of clusters for these searches depends strongly on the slope of the luminosity function ( e.g. , broadhurst et al .",
    "if the effective slope of the lf ( @xmath9 ) is greater than 1 , the gain in depth more than compensates for the loss in area , increasing the overall number of sources ( e.g. , broadhurst et al .",
    "1995 ) over that found in the field .",
    "such steep slopes are found at magnitudes brightward of @xmath10 ( corresponding to h@xmath1127 ab mag for @xmath2 galaxies ) .",
    "by contrast , at fainter magnitudes ( h@xmath827 for @xmath2 galaxies ) the effective slope of the lf is not quite so steep ( e.g. , the faint - end slope for the bouwens et al .",
    "2007 @xmath12 lf corresponds to @xmath13 ) .",
    "this trade - off between depth and area is such that the surface density of dropouts is lower behind clusters than in the field at faint magnitudes .",
    "overall these considerations suggest that the most significant advantages will be achieved at bright magnitudes ( @xmath14l@xmath6 ) where the lf is very steep .",
    "shallow searches over many clusters , in particular , would seem to be the most rewarding .",

    "ascertaining the precise redshift of a2667-z2 is difficult given the limited depth of the optical data around abell 2667 . without deeper optical data , it is essentially impossible to know which @xmath0 candidates correspond to high - redshift galaxies and which are lower redshift contaminants . note that we encountered similar difficulties in ascertaining the nature of the 4 weaker @xmath947 candidates found in our selection behind abell 2390 and abell 2667 ( neither of which has particularly deep optical coverage ) .",

    "in addition to the above comments about specific @xmath0 candidates in the richard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) selection , we also have several general concerns about the properties of this @xmath27-dropout selection .",
    "our first concern regards the @xmath95 color distribution of this selection .",
    "the colors are @xmath96 mag bluer on average than what we find in the field for our @xmath3-dropout sample ( bouwens et al .  2008 : figure a1 ) .",
    "they are also @xmath96 mag bluer than what one would expect for a young @xmath97 star - forming galaxy population ( as observed at @xmath98 : e.g. , lehnert & bremer 2003 ; stanway et al .",
    "2005 ; bouwens et al .",
    "it is hard to understand why @xmath3-dropouts from the richard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) selection would be so much bluer than these expectations unless the candidates had strong ly@xmath99 emission in the @xmath28 band .",
    "however , such an explanation would appear to be ruled out by the follow - up spectroscopy that richard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) conduct that find no such emission for the 7 @xmath3-dropout candidates they observe .",
    "second , we find it worrisome that almost all ( 8 out of 10 ) of their @xmath27-dropout candidates only satisfy their @xmath100 color criterion by a small margin ( @xmath101 mag ) whereas in the bouwens et al .",
    "( 2008 ) field sample , almost half of the @xmath3-dropouts satisfy the @xmath100 color criterion by a wide margin ( i.e. , @xmath102 mag ) .",
    "one would expect the situation to be quite opposite here , as a result of the much flatter number counts expected behind galaxy clusters ( the number of bright sources in cluster fields would increase due to magnification by the cluster and the number of faint sources would decrease because of the loss of area ) .",
