    "unfortunately , the spontaneous emission from the state @xmath39 redistributes some of the atomic population over the states @xmath53 and @xmath52 limiting in this way the degree of entanglement .",
    "since the two - photon coherences create superposition ( entangled ) states involving the states @xmath45 and @xmath39 , one can ask a question : how close is the entangled stationary state of the system to one of the maximally entangled bell states @xmath138 to answer this question we calculate the fidelities @xmath139 the fidelities depend on whether @xmath56 is positive or negative . for small interatomic distances",
    "@xmath58 is positive , and then the coherence @xmath56 is positive .",
    "hence , the fidelity @xmath140 becomes large while the fidelity @xmath141 is small .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the stationary state of the system is close to the maximally entangled bell state @xmath142 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we plot the fidelity @xmath140 as a function of @xmath15 for identical as well as nonidentical atoms . comparing the dependence on @xmath15 of the fidelity @xmath140 and concurrence",
    "@xmath143 gives us clear evidence that the entanglement in the system can be related to the bell state @xmath142 .",
    "the state of the system is of course mixed , but it is closer to the pure bell state @xmath142 for nonidentical atoms than for identical atoms . the entanglement created by the two - photon correlations present in the squeezed light is limited by the population stored in the other states .",
    "as the number of photons increases , for @xmath75 , more and more population goes to the states @xmath53 and @xmath52 , and eventually entanglement disappears for both identical as well as nonidentical atoms .",
    "there are optimal values of the mean number of photons for which the highest possible stationary entanglement can be obtained .",
    "in this paper , we have studied analytically the entanglement creation in a system of two atoms interacting with a squeezed vacuum field . we have demonstrated that nonclassical two - photon correlations characteristic of the squeezed field can create a large steady - state entanglement in the system .    in our approach",
    "we have used master equation to describe a system of two two - level atoms subjected to a squeezed vacuum field .",
    "the two atoms are coupled to each other via the vacuum field which leads to the collective damping and collective dipole - dipole type interaction between the atoms .",
    "we have assumed the two atoms to be separated by a distance @xmath0 , so the collective parameters depend explicitly on this distance .",
    "steady - state solutions for the atomic density matrix have been found for two cases : ( i ) identical atoms , ( ii ) nonidentical atoms .    we have derived analytical expressions for concurrence which is used to quantify the amount of entanglement created in the system .",
    "our results show that the necessary condition for entanglement are nonclassical two - photon correlations of the squeezed field .",
    "the entanglement also depends on the interatomic separation and the mean number of photons of the squeezed vacuum .",
    "the necessary condition for entanglement are quantum correlations of the squeezed field .",
    "there is no entanglement for classically correlated field .",
    "we have found that the degree of entanglement created in the system is a result of competition between the coherent process of transferring two - photon coherences from the squeezed vacuum to the atomic system and the incoherent process of spontaneous emission redistributing atomic population over the states not involved in the former process . in particular , we have shown that there is an optimum value of the mean number of photons for which the concurrence takes its maximum , and it happens for small number of photons . this is important from the point of view of practical applications .",
    "moreover , we have also found that the degree of entanglement obtainable in this way is much higher when the two atoms are not identical .",
    "we have discussed in detail physical reasons for such behaviour of the two - atom system .",
