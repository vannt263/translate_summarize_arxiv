    "the enumeration of self - avoiding walks ( saws ) on regular lattices is a classical combinatorial problem in statistical physics , with a long history , see e.g.  @xcite . of the three - dimensional lattices ,",
    "the simple cubic ( sc ) lattice has drawn the most effort , starting with a paper by orr  @xcite from 1947 , where the number of saws @xmath8 was given for all @xmath9 up to @xmath10 ; these results were obtained by hand . in 1959 ,",
    "fisher and sykes  @xcite used a computer to enumerate all saws up to @xmath11 ; sykes and collaborators extended this to 11 terms in 1961  @xcite , 16 terms in 1963  @xcite , and 19 terms in 1972  @xcite .",
    "in the following decade guttmann  @xcite enumerated saws up to @xmath12 in 1987 , and extended this by one step in 1989  @xcite . in 1992 , macdonald et al .",
    "@xcite reached @xmath13 , and in 2000 macdonald et al .",
    "@xcite reached @xmath14 . in 2007 , a combination of the lace expansion and the two - step method allowed for the enumeration of saws up to @xmath15 steps  @xcite .",
    "recently , the length - doubling method  @xcite was presented which allowed enumerations to be extended up to @xmath16 . to date , this is the record series for the sc lattice .",
    "the body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) and face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) lattices are in principle equally as physically relevant as the sc lattice , but enumeration is hampered by the larger lattice coordination numbers , which detriments most enumeration methods severely .",
    "it is also very slightly more cumbersome to write computer programs to perform enumerations for these lattices .",
    "consequentially , the sc lattice has served as the test - bed problem for new enumeration algorithms , and the literature on enumerations for the bcc and fcc lattices is far more sparse . for the bcc lattice ,",
    "@xmath8 was determined up to @xmath17 in 1972  @xcite , and to @xmath18 in 1989  @xcite .",
    "the current record of @xmath19 was obtained in 1997 by butera and comi  @xcite as the @xmath20 limit of the high temperature series for the susceptibility of the @xmath9-vector model . for the fcc lattice ,",
    "enumerations up to @xmath21 were performed in 1967  @xcite , and the record of @xmath22 was achieved way back in 1979  @xcite .",
    "enumeration results derive their relevance from the ability to determine critical exponents , which , according to renormalization group theory , are believed to be shared between saws on various lattices and real - life polymers in solution  @xcite .",
    "two such exponents are the entropic exponent @xmath0 and the size exponent @xmath1 . given the number @xmath8 of saws of all lengths up to @xmath23 and the sum @xmath24 of their squared end - to - end extensions",
    ", these two exponents can be extracted using the relations @xmath25 in these expressions , the growth constant @xmath26 and the amplitudes @xmath27 and @xmath28 are non - universal ( model - dependent ) quantities , while the leading correction - to - scaling exponent is a universal quantity with value @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "sub - leading corrections - to - scaling are absorbed into the @xmath30 term .",
    "@xmath31 is a lattice specific constant to ensure that our amplitude `` @xmath28 '' is the same as in earlier work .",
    "@xmath31 corrects for the fact that with our definition each step of the walk is of length @xmath32 for the bcc lattice ( leading to @xmath33 ) , and of length @xmath34 for the fcc lattice ( leading to @xmath35 ) .",
    "note that for bipartite lattices , of which the sc and bcc lattices are examples , there is an additional alternating `` anti - ferromagnetic '' singularity , that is sub - leading but which still must be treated carefully as the odd - even oscillations tend to become amplified by series analysis techniques .",
    "because of universality , the exponents are clearly more interesting from a physics perspective . however , accurate estimates for the growth constant and the amplitudes can also be very helpful for many kinds of computer simulations on lattice polymers .    in this paper",
    ", we used the length - doubling method  @xcite to measure @xmath8 and @xmath24 up to @xmath36 and 24 , on the bcc and fcc lattices , respectively .",
    "these lattices can be easily simulated as subsets of the sc lattice : the collection of sites in which @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are either all even or all odd forms a bcc lattice , and the collection of sites @xmath40 constrained to even values for @xmath41 forms a fcc lattice .",
    "we then analysed these results to obtain estimates for the exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the growth constant @xmath26 , and the amplitudes @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "our results for the two exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 agree with the values reported in literature which are obtained on the sc lattice , reinforcing the credibility of the literature values . our results for the growth constant @xmath26 and the amplitudes @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the bcc and fcc lattices are the most accurate ones to date .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we present a short outline of the length - doubling method , and present the enumeration data . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we describe the analysis method we use , before summarising our results and giving a brief conclusion in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we first present an intuitive description of the length - doubling method ; a more formal description can be found in  @xcite . in the length - doubling method",
    ", the number @xmath42 of saws with a length of @xmath43 steps , with the middle rooted in the origin , is obtained from the walks of length @xmath9 , with one end rooted in the origin , and the number @xmath44 of times that a subset @xmath45 of sites is visited by such a walk of length @xmath9 .",
    "the lowest - order estimate for @xmath42 is the number of combinations of two saws of length @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "this estimate is too large since it includes pairs of saws which overlap .",
    "the first correction to @xmath42 is the lowest - order estimate for the number of pairs of overlapping saws , which can be obtained from the number @xmath47 of saws of length @xmath9 which pass through a single site @xmath48 .",
    "the first correction is then to subtract @xmath49 , summed over all sites @xmath48 .",
    "this first correction is too large , as it includes pairs of saws twice , if they intersect twice .",
    "the second correction corrects for this over - subtraction , by adding the number @xmath50 of saws that pass through the pair of sites @xmath51 . continuing this process with groups of three sites ,",
    ", the number @xmath42 of saws of length @xmath43 can then be obtained by the length - doubling formula    @xmath52    where @xmath53 denotes the number of sites in @xmath45 .",
    "the usefulness of this formula lies in the fact that the numbers @xmath44 can be obtained relatively efficiently :    * generate each saw of length @xmath9 . *",
    "generate for each saw each of the @xmath54 subsets @xmath45 of lattice sites , and increment the counter for each specific subset .",
    "multiple counters for the same subset @xmath45 must be avoided ; this can be achieved by sorting the sites within each subset in an unambiguous way .",
    "* finally , compute the sum of the squares of these counters , with a positive and negative sign for subsets with an even and odd number of sites , respectively , as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : doubling ] ) .",
    "as there are @xmath8 walks of length @xmath9 , each visiting @xmath54 subsets of sites , the computational complexity is @xmath55 times some polynomial in @xmath9 which depends on implementation details .",
    "this compares favourably to generating all @xmath56 walks of length @xmath43 , provided @xmath57 .",
    "this is the case on the sc lattice , with @xmath58 , and even more so for the bcc and fcc lattices , as we will show .",
    "the length - doubling method can also compute the squared end - to - end distance , summed over all saw configurations ; for details we refer to  @xcite .",
    "details on the efficient implementation of this algorithm are presented in  @xcite .",
    "the direct results of the length - doubling method , applied to saws on the bcc and fcc lattices , are presented in tables 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the bcc results for @xmath59 and fcc results for @xmath60 were obtained and verified by two independent computer programs : sawdoubler 2.0 , available from http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~bisse101/saw/ , and raoul schram s program .",
    "the bcc results presented for the largest problems @xmath61 were obtained by sawdoubler 2.0 only , and the fcc results for @xmath62 were obtained by raoul schram s program only .",
    "thus the largest two problem instances for each lattice were not independently verified since these require a very large amount of computer time and memory .",
    "still , based on our analysis we believe that the given values are correct .    .",

    "[ cols=\">,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in conclusion , the length - doubling algorithm has resulted in significant extensions of the bcc and fcc series .",
    "the application of a recently invented series analysis technique  @xcite , which combines series extrapolation from differential approximants with direct fitting of the extrapolated series , has given excellent estimates of the various critical parameters .",
