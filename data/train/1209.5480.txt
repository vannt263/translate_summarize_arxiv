    "rough set theory , proposed by pawlak  @xcite , is an extension of set theory for the study of intelligent systems characterized by insufficient and incomplete information . in theory ,",
    "rough sets have been connected with matroids  @xcite , lattices  @xcite , hyperstructure theory  @xcite , topology  @xcite , fuzzy sets  @xcite , and so on .",
    "rough set theory is built on an equivalence relation , or to say , on a partition .",
    "but equivalence relation or partition is still restrictive for many applications . to address this issue ,",
    "several meaningful extensions to equivalence relation have been proposed . among them , zakowski has used coverings of a universe for establishing the covering based rough set theory  @xcite .",
    "many scholars have done deep researches on this theory  @xcite , and some basic results have been presented .",
    "neighborhood is an important concept in covering based rough set theory .",
    "many scholars have studied it from different perspectives .",
    "lin augmented the relational database with neighborhood  @xcite .",
    "yao presented a framework for the formulation , interpretation , and comparison of neighborhood systems and rough set approximations  @xcite . by means of consistent function based on the concept of neighborhood , wang et al .",
    "@xcite dealt with information systems through covering based rough sets .",
    "furthermore , the concept of neighborhood itself has produced lots of meaningful issues as well , and under what condition neighborhoods form a partition is one of them .",
    "many scholars have focused on this issue and conducted some researches on it  @xcite .",
    "different scholars provided different sufficient and necessary conditions respectively .",
    "however , there is a common trait among these necessary and sufficient conditions , that is the neighborhoods had been calculated out before the necessary and sufficient condition was presented .",
    "for example , yun et al .",
    "@xcite studied the conditions for neighborhoods to form a partition from the viewpoint of operators , while the operators were defined by all neighborhoods .",
    "if all the neighborhoods have been calculated out , then whether or not the neighborhoods form a partition is already clear .",
    "so it is necessary to seek condition for neighborhoods to form a partition directly based on the covering itself .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a necessary and sufficient condition directly based on the covering itself .",
    "first , we investigate the influence of that there are reducible elements in the covering on neighborhoods .",
    "we prove that the reducible elements in the covering have no influence on the neighborhoods induced by the covering .",
    "second , we propose the definition of uniform block and obtain a sufficient condition from it . we also give a counter - example to prove the condition is not necessary .",
    "third , we propose the definitions of repeat degree and excluded number , and obtain some properties of them . by means of the two concepts and their properties , we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for neighborhoods to form a partition .",
    "this necessary and sufficient condition for neighborhoods to form a partition does not involve in any lower or upper approximations , but the covering itself .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : basic definitions ] , we review the relevant concepts and introduce some existing results . in section  [ s : two sufficient conditions ] , we give two sufficient conditions for neighborhoods to form a partition . in section  [ s : the main theorem in this paper ] , we present a sufficient and necessary condition . section  [ s : conclusions ] concludes this paper and points out further works .",
    "we introduce the definitions of covering and partition at first .",
    "( covering ) let @xmath0 be a universe of discourse and @xmath1 a family of subsets of @xmath0 .",

    "every element of @xmath4 is called a partition block .",
    "it is clear that a partition of @xmath0 is certainly a covering of @xmath0 , so the concept of covering is an extension of the concept of partition .    in the following ,",
    "we introduce the definitions of neighborhood and neighborhoods , the two main concepts which will be discussed in this paper .",
    "( neighborhood  @xcite ) let @xmath1 be a covering of @xmath0 . for any @xmath9 , @xmath10 is called the neighborhood of @xmath11 .    in the following proposition",

    "@xmath17 is called the neighborhoods induced by @xmath1 .    by the definition of @xmath18",
    ", we see that @xmath18 is still a covering of universe @xmath0 .",
    "papers  @xcite provided some necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath18 to form a partition . in the following , we introduce the definition of covering approximation space and three conditions for @xmath18 to form a partition .",
    "( covering approximation space  @xcite ) let @xmath0 be a universe and @xmath1 a covering of @xmath0 .",
    "the ordered pair @xmath19 is called a covering approximation space .",

    "there are some more in - depth discussions in paper  @xcite regarding this issue .",
    "however , we can see that every @xmath29 was used directly or indirectly in the description of the necessary and sufficient conditions .",
    "in fact , if all the @xmath29 have been calculated out , then whether or not the neighborhoods form a partition is already clear . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will present a necessary and sufficient condition directly based on the covering itself .",
    "in this section , we present two sufficient conditions for neighborhoods to form a partition . the concept of reducible element is needed for the description of one sufficient condition .",

    "proposition  [ p : c - kisstillacovering ] guarantees that after deleting a reducible element in a covering , it is still a covering , whereas proposition  [ p : it is a reducible element of ] shows that deleting a reducible element in a covering will not generate any new reducible elements or make other originally reducible elements become irreducible elements of the new covering .",
    "so , we can compute the reduct of a covering of a universe @xmath0 by deleting all reducible elements in the same time , or by deleting one reducible element in a step .",
