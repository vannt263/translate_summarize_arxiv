    "the bohr correspondence principle is one of the basic principles underlying quantum theory .",
    "an essential of this principle is the formulation of quasi - classical transition from the quantum theory to its classical original , _ i.e. , _ indication of the conditions under which a given system can be considered classically .",
    "identification of the quasi - classical conditions is a twofold problem . roughly speaking",
    ", it consists of the kinematical and dynamical parts .",
    "the former is concerned with the motion of a system , while the latter with its interactions . from the point of view of quantum kinematics , determination of the quasi - classical conditions",
    "is a quantum mechanical problem .",
    "the motion of a system can be considered classically if @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the characteristic value of the system action .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for a sufficiently heavy particle . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamical part is essentially a quantum field problem .",
    "it requires examination of the fundamental interactions of the system .    at first sight , the above division of the whole problem into two parts",
    "is artificial . in quantum electrodynamics , for instance , the interaction of two charged particles takes the classical form of the coulomb law if the particles masses tend to infinity , since all radiative corrections to the electromagnetic form factors disappear in this limit .",
    "this is not the case , however , in quantum gravity , where the radiative corrections do not disappear in the large mass limit , because the value of the particle mass determines the strength of its gravitational interactions .",
    "in fact , the relative value of the logarithmic contribution ( which is of the order @xmath5 ) to the gravitational form factors of the scalar particle is independent of the scalar particle mass @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are contributions of the order @xmath6 which are proportional to the particle mass and have the form of the ordinary post - newtonian corrections @xcite",
    ".    the question of the correspondence between classical and quantum theories of gravity was considered in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the correct correspondence can only be established in the _ macroscopic _ limit .",
    "namely , the following formulation of the correspondence principle was suggested : the effective gravitational field produced by a macroscopic body of mass @xmath7 consisting of @xmath2 particles turns into the corresponding solution of the classical equations in the limit @xmath8 @xmath9 this interpretation is underlined by an observation that the @xmath10-loop radiative contribution to the post - newtonian correction of a given order to the gravitational field of a body with mass @xmath11 consisting of @xmath12 elementary particles with mass @xmath13 contains an extra factor of @xmath14 in comparison with the corresponding tree contribution .",
    "as this fact is central in what follows , let us take as an example the first post - newtonian approximation .",
    "in this case , there are two types of contributions to the gravitational field of the body .",
    "the first is the usual post - newtonian correction predicted by general relativity , reproduced in quantum theory by the tree diagrams _ bilinear _ in the energy - momentum tensor @xmath15 of the particles , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the second is the one - loop contribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . since this diagram has two particle operators attached , it is only _ linear _ in @xmath15 . therefore , when evaluated between @xmath2-particle states , the former is proportional to @xmath16 while the latter , to @xmath17    thus , in the case of gravity , classical consideration of both the kinematics and dynamics of a system is justified only for macroscopic systems .",
    "this property formally displays the gravitational interaction as an exception among other fundamental interactions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that despite this seemingly natural conclusion , the above formulation of the correspondence principle must be extended to all interactions . for this purpose we will investigate _ quantum fluctuations _ of the effective electromagnetic and gravitational fields",
    "obviously , system interactions can be considered classically only in the case of vanishing fluctuation of the field produced by the system .",
    "as we will see , this requirement puts all fundamental interactions on an equal footing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a general formula for the correlation function of arbitrary fields is written down in sec .",
    "[ tree ] , which is then used in the investigation of quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic and gravitational fields in secs .",
    "[ qfe ] and [ qfg ] , respectively .",
    "the results obtained are discussed in sec .",
    "[ conclude ] .",
    "some technical results used in the text are collected in two appendices .",
    "condensed notations of dewitt @xcite are in force throughout this paper .",
    "also , right and left derivatives with respect to the fields and the sources , respectively , are used .",
    "the dimensional regularization of all divergent quantities is assumed .",
    "before we proceed to actual calculations , let us consider the question of quantum fluctuations of the effective fields in more detail .",
    "let a given system of interacting fields @xmath18 be described by the action @xmath19.$ ] in the case when the system possesses gauge symmetries ( which is of primary concern for us ) , in addition to the matter and gauge fields the set @xmath20 contains a number of auxiliary fields ( the faddeev - popov ghosts , fields introducing the gauge _ etc .",
    "denoting by @xmath21 the source for the field @xmath22 we write the generating functional of green functions @xmath23 = \\int d\\varphi\\exp\\left\\{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left ( s[\\varphi ] + j^a\\varphi_a\\right)\\right\\}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 stands for the product of all @xmath25 @xmath26    as was mentioned in the introduction , our aim is to investigate the correspondence between classical and quantum theories from the point of view of quantum fluctuations of the effective fields .",
    "thus , we assume that the kinematics of our system is such that the inequality ( [ gg ] ) takes place , so the leading contribution to the functional integral ( [ gener ] ) is determined by the stationary `` point '' @xmath27 satisfying the classical equations of motion @xmath28 therefore , the generating functional of green functions takes the following quasi - classical form @xmath29 = \\exp\\left\\{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left ( s[\\varphi^{(0 ) } ] + j^a\\varphi^{(0)}_a\\right)\\right\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the help of this equation one finds the quasi - classical mean field @xmath30}{\\delta j^a } = \\frac{\\delta\\varphi^{(0)}_b}{\\delta j^a } ( - 1)^{p_b } \\left(\\frac{\\delta s[\\varphi]}{\\delta\\varphi_b } + j^b\\right)_{\\varphi = \\varphi^{(0 ) } } + \\varphi^{(0)}_a = \\varphi^{(0)}_a\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the grassmann parity of the field @xmath32 as expected , the mean field coincides at the tree level with the corresponding classical solution .",

    "the number of particles is inappropriate to reproduce the classical physics in the macroscopic limit .",
