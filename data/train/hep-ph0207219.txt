    "there has been a persisting discrepancy that the measured cross section of hadronic production of @xmath0 quarks measured by both cdf and d  collaborations @xcite is about a factor of two larger than the prediction in perturbative qcd with the most optimal choice of parameters , such as @xmath0-quark mass ( @xmath9 ) and the factorization scale @xmath10 , tuned to maximize the calculated rate .",
    "fragmentation function is used the observed excess can be reduced to an acceptable level .",
    "fields @xcite interestingly pointed out that correlations between the @xmath0 and @xmath11 can be used to isolate various sources of production , especially , in his study he included the fragmentation of gluon and light quarks .",
    "] recently , berger et al .",
    "@xcite interpreted the discrepancy in the scenario of light gluinos and light sbottoms .",
    "light gluinos of mass between @xmath1 gev are pair - produced by qcd @xmath12 and @xmath13 fusion processes , followed by subsequent decays of gluinos , @xmath14 , where the sbottom has a mass @xmath2 gev .",
    "therefore , in the final state there are @xmath15 , and the sbottoms either remain stable or decay into other light hadrons ( e.g. via @xmath16-parity violating couplings ) and go into the @xmath0-jets .",
    "gluino - pair production thus gives rise to inclusive @xmath0-quark cross section .",
    "the mass range of gluino is @xmath17 gev and sbottom @xmath18 gev .",
    "such masses are chosen so that both the total cross section and the transverse momentum spectrum of the @xmath0-quark are reproduced . before berger",
    "et al.s work , there have been some studies in the light sbottom and/or light gluino scenario @xcite .",
    "however , such a scenario can not be ruled out , unless there exists a sneutrino of at most 12 gev .",
    "such a scenario easily contradicts other experiments , especially , the @xmath19-pole data because of the light sbottom .",
    "however , it can avoid the @xmath3-pole constraints by tuning the coupling of @xmath20 to zero by choosing a specific mixing angle @xmath21 of @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the weinberg mixing angle . in spite of this",
    ", subsequent studies @xcite showed that such light gluino and sbottom will still contribute significantly to @xmath7 via one - loop gluino - sbottom diagrams . in order to suppress such contributions ,",
    "the second @xmath26 has to be lighter than about 180 gev ( at @xmath27 level ) with the corresponding mixing angle in order to cancel the contribution of @xmath28 in the gluino - sbottom loop contributions to @xmath7 .",
    "although berger et al.s scenario is not ruled out , it certainly needs a lot of fine tuning in the model . in other words , instead of saying this scenario is fine - tuned , we can say that so far the light gluino and light sbottom scenario is not ruled out .",
    "it definitely deserves more studies , no matter whether it was used to explain the excess in hadronic bottom - quark production or not",
    ".    the light gluino and light sbottom scenario will possibly give rise to other interesting signatures , e.g. , decay of @xmath29 into the light sbottom @xcite , enhancement of @xmath30 production at hadron colliders @xcite , decay of @xmath31 into a pair of light sbottoms @xcite , and affecting the higgs decay @xcite .",
    "in a previous work @xcite , we calculated the associated production of a gluino - pair with a @xmath12 pair and compared to the standard model ( sm ) prediction of @xmath32 at both lepi and lepii ( here @xmath33 refers to the sum over @xmath34 ) .",
    "we found that at lepii the @xmath35 production cross section is about @xmath36 of the sm production of @xmath32 , which may be large enough to produce an observable excess in @xmath32 events @xcite .",
    "this is rather model - independent , independent of the mixing angle in the sbottom , and is a qcd process .    in this work",
    ", we present another interesting channel in @xmath3 decay in the light gluino and light sbottom scenario : @xmath37 since the gluino is a majorana particle , so it can decay either into @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "the final state can be @xmath40 , @xmath41 , or @xmath42 .",
    "this channel , unlike the one mentioned in the previous paragraph , depends on the mixing angle of @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the @xmath43 coupling .    the hadronic branching ratio of this channel will be shown to be @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and for @xmath17 gev and @xmath48 gev , which is of order of the size of the uncertainty in @xmath7 .",
    "the process is the supersymmetric analog of @xmath49 , but kinematically they are very different because of the finite mass of the gluino and sbottom .",
    "a typical event consists of an energetic prompt bottom - jet back - to - back with a `` fat '' bottom - jet , which consists of a bottom quark and two bottom squarks .",
    "if such events can not be distinguished from the prompt @xmath50 events , they may increase the @xmath7 measurement ( @xmath51 @xcite ) with a hadronic branching ratio of @xmath52 .",
    "if the `` fat '' bottom jet can be distinguished from the ordinary bottom jet , then this kind of events would be very interesting on their own .",
    "it is a verification of the light gluino and light sbottom scenario .",
    "furthermore , if the flavor of the bottom quarks can be identified , the ratio of @xmath53 events can be tested ( theoretically it is @xmath54 ) @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present the calculation , including the decay of the gluino into @xmath55 or @xmath39 . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the results and various distributions that verify the `` fat '' bottom jet .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "iv . there is an analog in hadronic collisions , @xmath56 followed by @xmath57 .",
    "thus , it also gives rise to two hadronic bottom jets .",

    "numerically , the effect of @xmath9 is not negligible at @xmath125 . given that the total hadronic width of the @xmath3 boson is 1.745 gev @xcite , the hadronic branching fraction of the process @xmath126 is @xmath127 for @xmath45 and @xmath128 for @xmath47 , and @xmath17 gev .",
    "thus , this hadronic branching ratio is at the level of , or even larger than , the uncertainty in the @xmath7 measurement ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "if it can not be distinguished from the prompt @xmath50 events , it will affect the precision measurement on the @xmath50 yield at lep i.    in the following , we study the event topology to examine the difference from the prompt @xmath50 production , which essentially consists of two back - to - back clean bottom jets with energy equal to @xmath119 . in fig .",

    "we also note that the spectra are different between @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "these features are very different from the prompt @xmath50 production including qcd correction , in which both @xmath0 and @xmath11 are very energetic and the gluon is quite soft .    in fig .",
    "[ xbdec ] , we show the energy spectra for the decay products , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , of the gluino . since gluino is a majorana particle , it decays into either @xmath55 or @xmath39 .",
    "although there are some differences between these two decay modes because of the difference in the coupling , in both modes the @xmath134 and @xmath136 are rather soft .",
    "we also note that the spectra are different between @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , just by looking at the prompt @xmath0 and the secondary @xmath134 the energy spectra are very different from the prompt @xmath50 production . however",
    ", if the first and the second sbottoms go very close with the secondary @xmath134 and can not be separated experimentally , and the sbottoms deposit all their energies in the detector , then the event will mimic the prompt @xmath50 event .",
    "thus , it is important to look at the angular separation among the final - state particles .",
    "we show the cosine of the angles between the primary @xmath0 and the @xmath137 , between @xmath137 and @xmath136 , and between @xmath137 and @xmath138 in fig .",
    "here we only show the spectra for the case @xmath139 and gluino decay ch . 1 , because for @xmath139 or @xmath133 , ch . 1 or ch",
    ". 2 , the spectra are very similar .",
    "we can immediately see that the primary @xmath0 is back - to - back with the secondary @xmath137 from gluino decay .",
    "the @xmath137 and @xmath136 are very much close to each other that the cosine of the angle between them is peaked at @xmath140 .",
    "the cosine of the angle between @xmath137 and @xmath141 has a broader distribution , but still peaks in the @xmath142 region .",
    "thus , we have the following picture . the decay products , @xmath137 and @xmath136 , and the primary @xmath138 combine to form a wide or `` fat '' bottom - like jet .",
    "this `` fat '' bottom jet is back - to - back to the primary bottom jet , which has an energy close to @xmath119 .    here",
    "we comment on the possibility that the channel that we consider here may affect the @xmath7 measurement , based on two criteria .",
    "first , one of the bottom jet in the channel under consideration is `` fat '' .",
    "if the two sbottoms can not be separated from the bottom , the resulting bottom jet will just look like a fat bottom jet and may affect @xmath7 .",
    "second , whether the energy in this fat bottom jet equals to half of the @xmath3 mass or not . as mentioned by berger et al .",
    "@xcite , the sbottom can either decay into light hadrons or escape unnoticed from the detector .",
    "if the sbottoms escape the detection ( which means that they do not deposit enough kinetic energy in the detector material for detection ) , the fat bottom jet would have an energy much less than @xmath119 .",
    "the final - state would be two bottom jets ( one energetic and one much less energetic ) plus missing energy , and thus would not affect @xmath7 .",
    "neverthesless , this is a very interesting signal on its own . on the other hand ,",
    "if the sbottoms deposit all their kinetic energy in the detector , the measured energy of the fat bottom jet would be close to @xmath119 . in this case",
    ", it may affect the measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , it would increase @xmath7 .",
    "but if the fat bottom jet could be distinguished from the normal bottom jet , the present channel is also interesting on its own . according to a study on the light gluino @xcite , a sbottom of mass @xmath2 gev ,",
    "if similar to gluino , will likely deposit most of its kinetic energy in the detector .",
    "if this is the case the signal would be two back - to - back bottom jets , one of which is `` fat '' or wide , with no or little missing energy .",
    "we show that the light - sbottom - gluino scenario predicts the production of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath143 at the @xmath3 pole , with a branching fraction of order of @xmath8 , depending on the gluino mass and the sign of the mixing angle .",
    "the event topology is very different from the prompt @xmath50 production .",
    "depending on whether the sbottoms deposit little or almost all of their energies in the detector , the signal would be very different .",
    "if the sbottoms escape the detector unnoticed , the final - state would be two bottom jets ( one energetic and one much less energetic ) plus missing energy .",
    "on the other hand , if the sbottoms deposit all their kinetic energy in the detector , the final state will be two bottom jets , one of which is fat . in this case , it may increase the measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "but if the fat bottom jet could be separated from the normal bottom jet , it is a distinct signal .",
    "these two kinds of signals may well be hidden in the lep i data , waiting for deliberate search .",
    "one special feature of the majorana nature of the gluino predicts a ratio of 1:1:2 for the rates of @xmath144 @xcite .",
