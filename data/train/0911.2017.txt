    "the passage of energetic nuclei through various materials is a subject of experimental and theoretical investigations for several decades . in particular , the energy deposition by light nuclei in living tissues is of a primary importance for ion - beam cancer therapy  @xcite . several monte carlo particle transport codes like shield - hit  @xcite , phits  @xcite , fluka  @xcite , mcnpx  @xcite and geant4  @xcite are used to simulate the interaction of protons and nuclei with homogeneous phantoms made of tissue - like materials , voxelized phantoms based on 3d ct images of patient s body , as well as with beam - line elements , e.g. , nozzles and collimators .    as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite by calculations with the monte carlo model for heavy - ion therapy ( mchit ) , the recent versions of the geant4 toolkit  @xcite can be successfully used for simulations of carbon - ion therapy .",
    "however , until now the projectile nuclei heavier than carbon have received much less attention in studies with geant4 .",
    "recently we have performed a comparative study of the depth - dose distributions for beams of various light and medium - weight nuclei in water using the geant4 toolkit  @xcite .",
    "a proper description of physical and biological processes induced by light and heavy nuclei in extended media is important also for present and future exploration of space .",
    "this includes the design of shielding elements to be used during future interplanetary missions  @xcite , reliable estimations of the doses acquired by astronauts in long space flights , evaluations of radiation conditions at moon and other space colonies . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the galactic cosmic rays ( gcr ) present one of the main dangers for long - term human activities in space .",
    "the gcr present a very broad spectrum of nuclei , from hydrogen to iron , with kinetic energies from 10 mev to 100 gev per nucleon .",
    "the energy distribution has a maximum around 1 gev per nucleon , however , the tails can reach 1 tev per nucleon .",
    "it was demonstrated  @xcite that despite of their small fraction in gcr ( @xmath1 ) , the biological impact of heavy nuclei like fe on living tissues is very strong , comparable with the impact of protons .",
    "therefore , it is important to extend the capabilities of particle transport codes to the domain of heavy projectile nuclei , as it was done recently , for example , for the phits  @xcite and mcnpx  @xcite codes .    during propagation of high - energy nuclei in extended media",
    "a certain fraction of them undergoes inelastic interactions with target nuclei .",
    "it is quite common to assume that this process consists of three stages : ( 1 ) the initial fast stage of reaction when nuclei interact strongly with each other ; ( 2 ) preequilibrium stage when fast particles leave a highly excited nuclear system ; and ( 3 ) de - excitation of the equilibrated nuclear residues by evaporation of nucleons and light clusters or by breaks up into several fragments .",
    "most dynamical models used to describe the initial stage of nucleus - nucleus collisions come to the conclusion that after a time interval of a few tens of fm / c fast particles escape , and the evolution of the remaining nuclear system changes its character . because of intensive interaction between nucleons the residual nuclei evolve toward statistical equilibrium",
    ". if the excitation energy is low , the hot compound nucleus undergoes de - excitation by evaporating nucleons and light clusters . at higher excitation energies the hot residual nucleus expands and breaks up into hot primary fragments , which later on undergo de - excitation by evaporating nucleons and light clusters .",
    "it is interesting to note that a wide variety of secondary nuclei , including exotic nuclei , e.g. hypernuclei , can be created in the earth s atmosphere by energetic cosmic nuclei .",
    "however , it is very difficult to detect these products of nuclear reactions .    in our studies with geant4  @xcite",
    "the initial stage was simulated by means of the light - ion binary cascade model ( g4binarylightionreaction )  @xcite .",
    "this model treats a nucleus - nucleus collision as a sequence of individual nucleon - nucleon collisions in the region where the colliding nuclei overlap with each other .",
    "the production of secondary hadrons , e.g. pions , in nucleon - nucleon collisions is also taken into account .",
    "since this model is a straightforward extension of the hadron - nucleus binary cascade model  @xcite , it does not include collective phenomena such as compression of nuclear matter or collective flow of secondary products . due to these simplifications",
    "the model developers suggested that it is relevant to nucleus - nucleus collisions where at least one of the colliding nuclei is not much heavier than carbon nucleus .",
    "in general , the monte carlo simulations for ion - therapy with beams of light nuclei  @xcite propagating in tissue - like materials are within the scope of the binary cascade model , as mostly h , c , and o nuclei are involved .",
    "the light - ion binary cascade model is recommended to be applied for projectile nuclei with energies between 50  @xmath0 mev and 10  @xmath0 gev  @xcite .",
    "the primary excitation energy of a nuclear residue left after the cascade stage of reaction is defined by the numbers of excitons , i.e .",
    "particles ( captured nucleons ) and holes ( nucleons removed from the nuclear core ) .",
    "the wilson abrasion model ( g4wilsonabrasionmodel ) is available as a part of geant4 toolkit  @xcite as an alternative approach for simulating inelastic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "it is dealing with calculating volumes of nuclear residues ( spectators ) and their excitation energies rather than with detailed consideration of nucleon - nucleon collisions in the overlap ( fireball ) zone .",
    "for the sake of simplicity the angular distribution of the nucleons abraded from a nucleus is assumed to be isotropic in the reference frame of this nucleus .",
    "the momentum distributions of such nucleons are simulated according to a phenomenological expression with parameters depending on the value of fermi momentum of the corresponding nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the model has no restrictions on the masses of colliding nuclei , but the production of secondary hadrons , e.g. mesons , in the overlap zone is ignored .",
    "therefore , the predictions of the wilson abrasion model become less and less accurate with increasing beam energy above the pion production threshold .",
    "this reduces the energy domain of applicability of the wilson abrasion model as compared to the light - ion binary cascade model .    in the abrasion model",
    "the excitation energy of nuclear residues comes from two sources : ( 1 ) from excess of their surface energy associated with their non - spherical shape and ( 2 ) from the energy deposited by abraded nucleons passing through them . as well established ,",
    "several de - excitation mechanisms are responsible for de - excitation of nuclear residues : emission of nucleons and light clusters , nuclear fission and multifragmentation .",
    "as follows from the statistical model analysis  @xcite , evaporation dominates at low excitation energies , less than 3 mev per nucleon .",
    "it is characterized by modest changes in the charge and mass of the initial residual nucleus , as only few neutrons , protons and alphas are emitted in a relatively long time scale .",
    "nuclear fission is a dominant de - excitation mechanism only for very heavy nuclear residues like th or u. the multifragment break - up of nuclei or multifragmentation becomes important at excitation energies above 3 mev per nucleon and is characterized by a relatively short time scale of about 100 fm / c  @xcite . as established by many experiments , this is a dominating process for production of intermediate mass fragments . in recent years",
    "it has been demonstrated by numerous calculations that this process can be well described within the statistical approaches such as fermi break - up model for light nuclei and statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) for medium and heavy nuclei  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contribution of multifragmentation to the total reaction cross section was estimated at the level of 10 - 15% for hadron - nucleus collisions , and about twice as large for nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , only the shield - hit code and the geant4 toolkit take into account multifragmentation of medium - weight and heavy nuclei in transport calculations for extended media .",
    "due to radical changes in mass and charge of the projectile nucleus following multifragmentation , the ionization energy loss changes dramatically .",
    "therefore , inclusion of nuclear multifragmentation in calculations of ion energy deposition in extended media will lead to changes in depth - dose distributions as well as in yields of secondary fragments produced in nuclear fragmentation reactions .",
    "we believe that the role of violent disintegration of highly excited nuclei should be carefully evaluated for a set of practical applications which deal with energetic ion transport in extended media , especially for cancer therapy and cosmic radiation protection .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we give a brief description of the fermi break - up model for decay of light nuclei ( g4fermibreakup ) in sec .",

    "for a light nucleus with a mass number @xmath2 and a charge @xmath3 ( in the following we assume @xmath4 ) even a relatively small excitation energy may be comparable to its binding energy . in this case",
    "we assume that the explosive decay of the excited nucleus into several smaller clusters is the principal mechanism of de - excitation . to describe this process we use a model which is similar to the famous fermi break - up model for multiple particle production in proton - proton collisions  @xcite . later on it",
    "was extended to the multifragment break - up of highly excited nuclei , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "it is assumed that the excited nucleus decays simultaneously into cold or slightly excited fragments , which have lifetimes longer than the decay time , estimated as about 100 fm / c .",
    "the break - up configuration is characterized by some freeze - out volume @xmath5 , where the produced fragments are placed .",
    "the volume available for the translational motion , the so - called free volume @xmath6 , is smaller than the freeze - out volume , at least , by the proper volume of the fragments , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the initial volume of the nucleus at normal nuclear density @xmath9  @xmath10 . below the following parameterization is used : @xmath11 , while @xmath12 is a model parameter of order  1 .",

    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model becomes less accurate below 100 mev when the emission channels with only few fragments dominate , in particular , in the case of @xmath38c and @xmath36o targets .",
    "the description of such two- and three - body decay channels can be improved by considering alternative reaction mechanisms , e.g. the direct knock - out of light clusters , which do not requires the formation of a compound nucleus .",
