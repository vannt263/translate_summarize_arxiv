    "long before the development of cryptography and encryption , one of humankind s best techniques of secretly delivering a message was to hide the fact that a message was even delivered at all . a well - known example of this is from ancient times where one person would shave another s head and write a message on it .",
    "it was only after waiting for their hair to grow back that they would then be sent to the intended recipient , who would again shave the scalp to reveal the message .",
    "this is historically one of the first - known examples of covert communication , i.e. , the ability to communicate without being detected  @xcite .    today",
    ", even though advanced encryption techniques are available , there is still a need to hide the fact that communication is taking place from malicious eavesdroppers , e.g. , secret government operations .",
    "modern approaches of such covert communication exist from digital steganography to spread spectrum communication and more  @xcite .",
    "another approach consists of hiding information in the naturally occurring thermal noise of optical channels , such as additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels  @xcite .",
    "a natural quantum generalization of the awgn channel is the lossy bosonic channel ; a beam splitter mixing the signal with a vacuum state ( pure - loss channel ) or a thermal state .",
    "the lossy bosonic channel is a good model of losses for quantum - optical links used in quantum communication .",
    "covert transmission in this case has been considered both from the point of view of a classical channel with a powerful quantum hacker  @xcite , as well as recently , an all - quantum channel and hacker  @xcite .",
    "understandably , refs .",
    "@xcite concluded that a pure - loss channel can not be used because there is no way to stealthy hide the information , i.e. , when the hiding medium ( thermal noise ) is absent .",
    "surprisingly , the situation does not get much better if the signal is mixed with a thermal state . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the asymptotic rate of covert communication is zero and , worse , the probability of a decoding error does not vanish for realistic photon detectors .    in this paper",
    ", we show that in fact no concealing medium or object is needed at all in order to hide quantum information transfer at large distances .",
    "this counterintuitive result relies on the machinery of relativistic quantum mechanics ",
    "quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we show that covert quantum communication is possible using the intrinsic resource of time - like entanglement present in minkowski vacuum  @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the entanglement of minkowski vacuum that can be mined at space - like distances as pioneered by  @xcite following early insights from  @xcite .",
    "cosmological and other consequences of space - like entanglement were investigated in  @xcite for observers equipped with an unruh - dewitt ( udw ) detector  @xcite and following various trajectories  @xcite . in our case",
    "the local measurements of two temporally and spatially separated parties induce a quantum channel whose asymptotic rate of quantum communication supported by the two - way classical communication is in fact nonzero . we have calculated an upper bound on the communication rate and interpreted it as the ultimate covert communication rate . our results offers significant differences from previous work relating to both relativistic quantum information protocols and non - relativistic quantum protocols .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite ( also following  @xcite ) that quantum key distribution could be achieved without actually sending a quantum signal by exploiting the concept of time - like entanglement .",
    "however , the authors of  @xcite did not consider the application of covert quantum communication and also considered the use of continuous variables  @xcite as the substrate .",
    "our approach based on discrete variables allows us to do away with the shared coherent beam needed to synchronize the local oscillators ( needed for homodyne detection ) that could eventually blow the cover .",
    "another problem with the oscillator mode may be its delivery especially for participants below the horizon or at large distances .",
    "our construction avoids this problem while reaching similarly large distances for quantum communication . for our protocol as well as for",
    "@xcite the parties have to independently solve the problem of how to covertly exchange classical messages . in general , we can not do away with classical communication at large spatial distances but we did find instances where no classical communication is needed at all .    this paper is structured as follows .",
    "[ sec : entgen ] is the technical part of the paper where we introduce two inertial observers both equipped with an unruh - dewitt detector .",
    "we analyze the response of the detectors to the fourth perturbative order and extract the quantum state of the two detectors after the scalar field has been traced out as the main object of our study . in sec .",

    "they showed that for a large class of channels ( so - called ` teleportation covariant ' ) the following inequality holds @xmath168 where @xmath169 are all adaptive strategies and @xmath170 is a separable state .",
    "it turns out that the following inequalities hold : @xmath171 note that @xmath172 holds as well  ( see  @xcite ) .    finally , the authors of  @xcite defined the max - relative entropy of entanglement of a quantum channel @xmath128 as @xmath173 where @xmath152 is the channel s input state and in general we have @xmath174 the states @xmath170 are chosen from the set of separable states and the max - relative entropy @xmath175 is defined as  @xcite @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the greatest eigenvalue of @xmath178 .",
    "the max - relative entropy of entanglement was shown to satisfy @xmath179 looking at the above definitions it does not come as a surprise that the upper bound could be difficult to find as well and so a simplified upper bound ( on the upper bound ) was devised  @xcite : @xmath180 where @xmath170 is a separable state representing a choi matrix of an entanglement - breaking channel . comparing ( [ eq : maxreechnl ] ) and  ( [ eq : maxree ] ) with  ( [ eq : choieb ] )",
    "we see that we removed one optimization step that we would not be able to perform anyway as discussed earlier in this section .",
    "ultimately , our goal is to maximize the secret key rate and distance for the physical parameters of the unruh - dewitt detectors such that they are reasonably realistic .",
    "this is a hard problem as the integrals  from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : j23forl ] ) must be solved numerically which itself is a rather time - consuming process if we want to make sure that the values we get can be trusted .",
    "hence we choose the following strategy : for realistically chosen atomic parameters we made an educated guess and showcase our results by calculating the best rates we could find at the expense of a relatively small ( but still respectable ) distance and the best distance for a smaller but positive secret key rate . especially here",
    "we got to an impressive distance in the order of thousands of kilometers so let s start with this case .",
    "we set the parameters introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : udwhint ] ) and  ( [ eq : gaussianprofile ] ) to be @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the eof of the corresponding state @xmath33 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratelada ] .",
    "we can see that it quickly decreases for @xmath183 but remains positive for more than a thousand kilometers indicating the presence of entanglement at large distances that can be used for two - way quantum communication . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "as long as @xmath33 is entangled the two - way secret key rate is strictly positive .",
    "but we do not know the actual rate of covert communication except with one truly remarkable exception . for the immediate vicinity of @xmath184 the one - way quantum capacity is nonzero : @xmath185 for @xmath186 . this result is useless for covert communication for large distances but nonetheless conceptually important",
    "@xmath187 provides not only an achievable lower bound on the one - way secret key rate as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ineqchain1 ] ) but mainly we can exploit @xmath188  @xcite .",
    "that is , the participants do not have to classically communicate at all .",
    "they have to initially agree on a decoding strategy without the need to talk again in order to quantum communicate .",
    "one could wonder why the channel is not an identity for @xmath189 .",
    "this is because @xmath184 does not mean a measurement at the same time and especially on the same system .",
    "it rather corresponds to the situation depicted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : timelike ] .",
    "the information is sent to the future where it is received at the same spatial position but by a completely different observer ( in his own lab that could have been built in the meantime ) .    by tuning the detectors parameters we can increase the eof ( and most likely the rate as well ) .",
    "the eof is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratel ] for the following set of parameters : @xmath190 and @xmath191 . for @xmath184",
    "we get a better result compared to fig .  [",
    "fig : ratelada ] but it drops to zero .",
    "this is the area marked by an arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratel ] .",
    "the zero point coincides with @xmath192 becoming separable . as in the previous case ,",
    "the dimension of the detectors state @xmath33 makes it easy to find an upper bound via the eof but it is also a good opportunity to test how tight bounds we would have gotten if we could not rely on the calculable eof .",
    "first , we plotted the unoptimized squashed entanglement eq .",
    "( [ eq : squashedent ] ) where @xmath193 was set ( see the blue dashed curve ) .",
    "it is clearly an inappropriate bound which is not surprising given the trivial squashing channel . to get a better upper bound we numerically optimized over the system @xmath194 such that @xmath195 using the tools from  @xcite",
    "this provides a better estimate and surprisingly , sometimes ( for @xmath184 ) even better than the one given by the eof .",
    "another plotted estimate is the simplified upper bound on the max - relative entropy of entanglement eq .",
    "( [ eq : choieb ] ) we calculated numerically ( green curve ) .",
    "overall , it grossly overestimates the eof but provides a better estimate when @xmath129 is becoming separable .",
    "the third of the mentioned estimates , eq .  ( [ eq : reestretch ] ) , is not known to be applicable to our channel .",
    "we can also study how the coupling strength @xmath196 affects the rate .",
    "for the parameters @xmath197 , and @xmath198 ( we set @xmath184 ) we plot the eof against @xmath196 in  fig .",
    "[ fig : ratelam ] . as expected , with a decreasing coupling constant @xmath196",
    "the rate goes down as well until the state becomes so weakly coupled that it is separable and the rate is zero .",
    "we will comment on an interesting problem of what eavesdropping actually means in our situation .",
    "no quantum signal is exchanged between the communicating parties and so an eavesdropper can not take direct advantage of the qkd paradigm of how the security is analyzed : normally , any kind of channel noise is attributed to the eavesdropper and the value of the secret key rate reflects the fact whether under this assumption information - theoretic security can be achieved . in our opinion",
    "there are two possibilities of how eve can interact with the system held by the legitimate parties and none of them affects the obtained results .",
    "eve could gain access to the labs and tamper with the detectors .",
    "but this is really an out - of - the - scope attack , something more similar to a side - channel attack in qkd where an eavesdropper manipulates the detector s efficiency by sending laser pulses  @xcite .",
    "a more relevant attack would be eve setting up her own detectors at various spacetime points . in principle",
    "she could be in possession of a multipartite entangled state @xmath199 or even a purification of the state shared by the sender and the receiver .",
    "but this does not help her at all since she can not manipulate the marginal state @xmath33 . as a matter of fact",
    ", this is precisely the assumption in the security of qkd  an eavesdropper holds the purification  @xcite ( or the complementary output of the channel  @xcite ) and the secret key rate is calculated or estimated under these most advantageous conditions for the eavesdropper .",
    "we developed a truly fundamental covert quantum communication protocol by exploiting the properties of minkowski vacuum .",
    "contrary to the previously introduced schemes , the covert communication does not need to be hidden in the environmental ( thermal ) noise and is not limited to a particular model of an optical quantum channel .",
    "what makes our results fundamental is that the rate of covert communication in the asymptotic limit of quantum communication is in fact strictly positive ; where previous results tended towards zero in the same limit . in our scheme",
    "no quantum signal is exchanged at all which is possible due to intrinsically quantum properties of minkowski vacuum essentially offering preshared entangled states at large spatial distances .",
    "we tapped into this resource by equipping two inertial observers by specially crafted unruh - dewitt detectors ( following  @xcite ) and calculating their response up to the fourth perturbative order .",
    "we found that the detectors are entangled and we analyzed the meaning of this entanglement from the quantum communication point of view .",
    "we found that for suitable parameters and using two - way quantum communication , that a positive secret key rates can be achieved over thousands of kilometers .",
    "the main open problem is whether we can avoid classical communication altogether for greater distances .",
    "we have shown that quantum information can be covertly sent to the same place in the future without the need to classically communicate whatsoever .",
    "this is possible because of the positive value of the coherent information for the corresponding quantum channel . to answer this question we would need to go well beyond the fourth perturbative order  a strategy that would bring the answer to another open problem : what is the actual non - perturbative channel ? if @xmath33 is interpreted as a choi - jamiokowski matrix",
    "as was advocated here , then its form strongly resembles a qubit pauli channel .",
    "this hardly can be true for an arbitrary value of the detector parameters since in order for it to be a pauli channel the first and last diagonal elements @xmath33 must be equal .",
    "but perhaps in some regime or limit this could indeed be the case .",
    "the authors thank nathan walk and timothy ralph for comments ."
