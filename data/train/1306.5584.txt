    "effective field theory ( eft ) is well established method for treating models exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite and is applicable to low - energy part of any system whose only massless excitations are goldstone bosons @xcite .",
    "initially developed for the description of low - energy sector of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , where it is known by the name of the chiral perturbation theory @xcite , eft was also adapted for the condensed matter problems @xcite .",
    "in particular , an application of eft to heisenberg ferromagnet ( hfm ) has met with considerable success @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , the ground state @xmath1 of a hfm is determined by a preferred direction in the internal space , singled out by the total spin @xmath2 and small fluctuations of the order parameter near the ground state are described by goldstone bosons ( magnons ) of spontaneously broken ( spin ) rotational symmetry . in the low dimensional ( @xmath3 , @xmath0 being the dimensionality of spatial lattice ) isotropic ferromagnets with short - range interactions , rotational symmetry of the heisenberg hamiltonian is restored at finite temperatures @xcite and spontaneous symmetry breaking is possible only if @xmath4 .",
    "( henceforth we will always assume @xmath4 and nearest neighbor interaction . )",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) in hfm is distinguished from its lorentz - invariant counterparts , since the number of goldstone particles is less than the number of broken generators . in lorentz - invariant theories",
    ", the number of goldstone bosons ( @xmath5 ) , as well as the number of goldstone fields ( @xmath6 ) , equals the number of broken symmetry generators ( @xmath7 ) , i.e. @xmath8 . here g denotes spontaneously broken ( internal ) symmetry group of the underlying system and h is the symmetry group of the ground state .",
    "even though the symmetry breaking pattern in hfm is @xmath9 , the excitation spectrum contains only one type of magnon .",
    "this is related to the fact that ferromagnetic magnons possess nonrelativistic dispersion @xmath10 due to nonzero vacuum expectation values of charge densities @xcite , and a complex field @xmath11 describes a single particle @xcite . in other words ,",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 represent canonically conjugate variables and not two distinct goldstone fields @xcite . a general theorem on ssb in lorentz - noninvariant systems @xcite asserts that twice the number @xmath14 equals rank of the matrix @xmath15 , defined by its elements @xmath16|0 \\ran$ ] , where @xmath17 denotes the spatial volume of the system and @xmath18 is the set of broken generators ( integrals of charge densities ) .",
    "if , as usual , the spontaneous magnetization aligns in the direction of positive @xmath19 axis , one finds @xmath20 $ ] and corresponding single ferromagnetic magnon .",
    "this is in accordance with standard spin - wave theory .",
    "the theorem was recently proved in @xcite using eft ( see also related work in @xcite ) demonstrating once again usefulness of the effective lagrangian method in the theories without lorentz invariance .    on the other hand ,",
    "the thermodynamic properties of ferromagnets are usually calculated by some variant of spin - wave theory .",
    "the predictions of linear spin - wave theory ( lswt ) are reliable almost up to @xmath21 ( @xmath22 denotes the curie temperature ) , but for quantitative description beyond this temperatures one needs to incorporate the effects of magnon - magnon interactions .",
    "a successful theory of the spin - wave interactions in heisenberg ferromagnets was put forward by dyson @xcite .",
    "he had shown that the kinematical interaction , arising from the limitation on the maximum number ( @xmath23 ) of the spin deviations on each lattice site , may safely be ignored at temperatures not to close to @xmath22 .",
    "dyson also demonstrated the weakness of dynamical magnon - magnon interaction by calculating first order correction to the free energy and spontaneous magnetization of 3d hfm , thus providing an explanation for the success of lswt .",
    "the weakness of magnon - magnon interactions reflects itself through the changes in the bloch s law .",
    "the first correction due to magnon - magnon interactions is only of order @xmath24 , compared to the leading term proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "dyson s results were subsequently rederived using holstein - primakoff bosons @xcite and the diagram technique for spin operators @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for a comprehensive reviews and list of original references . )",
    "the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) revived interest in the heisenberg magnets . since the mid of 1980-ties , a lot of work was put in the understanding of spin - wave interactions in systems of localized spins .",
    "theoretical constructions from this period , dealing explicitly with the heisenberg ferromagnets , include the modified spin wave theory ( mswt , see @xcite ) , the large @xmath26 expansion of su(@xmath26 ) heisenberg models and schwinger boson mean field theory ( sbmft , see @xcite ) , the self - consistent spin wave theory @xcite and renormalization group ( rg ) methods @xcite . as in the earlier works @xcite , the authors of @xcite had shown that a realistic description of the low temperature phase of hfm can be reached using bosonic ( or combined bosonic - fermionic @xcite ) representations of the spin operators within quartic approximation , or with the help of appropriate mean field / random phase approximations ( mfa / rpa ) , without complicated mathematical constructions of dyson . as an alternative to boson / fermion hamiltonians , obtained from one of many representation of spin operators @xcite ,",
    "several authors developed the method of double time temperature green s functions ( tgf ) .",
    "( a recent review and original references can be found in @xcite . )",
    "it is based on the equations of motion for spin operators , which are turned into a solvable system of algebraic equations by suitable linearization .",
    "known as the decoupling schemes in the language of the double time tgfs , the linearizations incorporate effects of magnon - magnon interactions without any direct reference to the nonlinear boson / fermion hamiltonian , i.e. to the magnon - magnon interaction operator .",
    "one of the most frequently used approximations of this kind is the one by tyablikov ( trpa , see @xcite ) , usually described as the one in which correlations between @xmath27 and @xmath28 operators from adjacent sites are neglected .",
    "magnon energy renormalization , a consequence of tyablikov s approximation , affects the low - temperature regime of the theory .",
    "the low - temperature expansion of ferromagnetic order parameter for 3d lattice calculated in trpa contains so called spurious term @xmath29 , in disagreement with rigorous results of dyson . despite this , trpa yields reliable predictions in accordance with mermin - wagner theorem and closed system of equations for correlation functions is often tractable within standard numerical tools .",
    "also , unique solution for critical temperature with self - consistently determined parameters agrees well with monte carlo simulations and experimental values @xcite .",
    "this aspect of true self - consistency comes to be important when real compounds are modeled by heisenberg ferromagnet / antiferromagnet ( see e.g. @xcite for an application of trpa to cuprates , iron pnictides and manganites ) .",
    "the standard theories of non - linear spin waves mentioned in the previous paragraph are based on boson / fermion representations of spin operators .",
    "since the commutation relations for spin operators and the dynamics of the spin system are fully satisfied only with exact boson / fermion hamiltonian and corresponding hilbert space , theories of non - linear spin waves are sensitive to any form of approximation .",
    "these include , e.g , various mean - field approximations in the heisenberg spin hamiltonian @xcite , or approximate boson / fermion expressions for spin operators @xcite .",
    "similar remark holds for the theories based on the equations of motion for the spin operators where the approximations are made in the commutator for @xmath30 operators ( see @xcite and the section [ pd ] ) .",
    "all these simplifications basically alter the spin nature of @xmath31 operators in a manner that may not be obvious within a given framework .",
    "these problems do not arise in the eft approach , since one works with true magnon operators from the beginning .",
    "all simplifications are directly related to the piece of lagrangian ( hamiltonian ) describing magnon - magnon interactions .",
    "this makes the influence of approximation more transparent .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the perturbation theory with lattice regularization has not yet been applied to the eft of a ferromagnet .",
    "there are several reasons for using a lattice within hamiltonian formalism .",
    "first , unlike dimensional regularization , frequently used within eft framework @xcite , the lattice regularization preserves full discrete symmetry of the original heisenberg hamiltonian and it seems to be an appropriate method to deal with system initially defined on a lattice .",
    "second , we will address to some issues inaccessible to the continuum field theoretical methods of @xcite , such as the influence of interactions on magnon energy renormalization over the entire brilouin zone .",
    "further , it is the structure of interacting hamiltonian for ferromagnetic magnons , rather than the general form of interacting lagrangian , that reveals certain simplifications in the diagrammatic calculation of the magnon self - energy and free energy of o(3 ) hfm .",
    "although it lacks some of the systematization capabilities of continuum field theoretical approach , the lattice regularized theory can provide us with a useful information not just about spin systems but also on other standard techniques .",
    "for example , by examining magnon mass renormalization in sections [ se2loop ] and [ rotsymlagr ] , we reach a clear explanation for spurious @xmath32 term in tyablikov rpa .",
    "the section [ pd ] contains brief discussion on lswt , the magnon mass renormalization and its influence on the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "some notation on the lattice theory , such as the lattice laplacian , are likewise introduced there .",
    "the effective interaction hamiltonian of lattice magnons is derived in the section [ effinter ] , starting from the effective lagrangian .",
    "the feynman diagrams with colored propagators and vertices , suitable for theories of lattice scalar fields with derivative couplings are also defined in the section [ effinter ] .",
    "two - loop perturbation theory for lattice magnon self - energy is presented in the section [ se2loop ] , while three - loop analysis of the free energy is given in the section [ 3lfe ] .",
    "results of section [ rotsymlagr ] , based on continuum field theoretic calculation supplement and clarify findings of two preceding sections .",
    "an important feature of the effective hamiltonian is identification of the two types of magnon - magnon interaction different in origin .",
    "the careful discussion in sections [ effinter][rotsymlagr ] offers a new answer for appearance of the spurious terms in the low - temperature series and demonstrates the influence of spin - rotation symmetry on the thermodynamic properties of o(3 ) hfm .",
    "finally , some calculation details and an alternative formulation of the o(2 ) model of the subsection [ eftrpa ] are collected in the appendices .",
    "in this section we are motivating approach to be discussed in detail latter . also , for the clarity of presentation , we find it convenient to introduce some notation on lattice fields before general perturbation theory .",
    "first , it is instructive to rewrite the hamiltonian of heisenberg ferromagnet with nearest neighbor interaction @xmath33 on a @xmath0 dimensional lattice h & = & - _ , s_n s_n + , [ hfm1 ] in terms of the discrete laplacian h & = & - _ x s_x ^2 s_x - .",

    "( [ lleq ] ) is just the lattice version of imaginary time landau - lifshitz equation for operators @xmath41 .",
    "it can be solved in a linear approximation . assuming the long range order ( lro )",
    ", we may set @xmath42   if @xmath43 . ] . in this approximation ,",
    "equation of motion for @xmath44 takes the form of the imaginary time equation for schrdinger field on the lattice -_s^+(x ) & = & - ^2 s^+(x ) [ seq1 ] , where we have defined m _ = [ mlsw ] .",
    "similar equation holds for @xmath45 .",
    "simultaneously , the linearized commutation relations for @xmath30 operators read = ( x - y ) [ kr1 ] . comparing ( [ kr1 ] ) to the usual form of equal - time commutation relations , @xmath46 = v_0^{-1 } \\delta(\\bm x - \\bm y)$ ] , where @xmath47 denotes volume of the primitive cell , we see that in this approximation the heisenberg ferromagnet is described by the bosonic lattice schrdinger fields ( x , ) = , ^(x , ) = , [ psidef1 ] which annihilate and create magnons at lattice site @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "schrdinger field interpretation can be further justified by solving equation ( [ seq1 ] ) and constructing a diagonal hamiltonian . finding plane - wave solutions @xcite of ( [ seq1 ] ) ( x , ) = _ k a_k ^ik x - ( k ) , _ k _ [ rpapw ] and using eigenvalues of the lattice laplacian & & ^2 = - [ 1-_d(k ) ] [ ksq ] + & & - ^2 , _",

    "operating on the vacuum @xmath1 , @xmath53 creates one - magnon state @xmath54 .",
    "these states are normalized as @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we may now identify @xmath56 as ( bare ) mass of the lattice field quanta i. e. magnons .",
    "we shall continue to refer to @xmath56 as a magnon mass because of the nonrelativistic form of the dispersion relation ( [ omegalsw ] ) , even though ferromagnetic magnons are `` massless '' from the point of view of the goldstone theorem .",
    "the diagonal hamiltonian makes thermodynamical properties of a ferromagnet trivial to calculate .",
    "for example , at low temperatures , the spontaneous magnetization per lattice site is found to be a vacuum expectation value of s_x^z & = & s - + & = & s - v_0 ^(x ) ( x ) . written in terms of the thermal propagator for schrdinger field d(x - y , _ x - _ y ) & = & \\ { ( x,_x ) ^(y,_y ) } _ 0 [ prop ] + & = & 1_n = -^ _ q , it is s^z = s-",

    ".    the question of how to incorporate the effects of magnon - magnon interactions into equations like ( [ szpropagator ] ) has long history and long list of answers .",
    "they are grouped in several categories as described in the introduction .",
    "the primary goal of the present paper is to show that thermodynamic properties of a @xmath0 dimensional o(3 ) heisenberg ferromagnet may be calculated within formalism of interacting lattice schrdinger field , based on the effective lagrangian .",

    ", it is easily seen that approximation @xmath63 in ( [ lleq ] ) eventually leads to trpa result with the magnon energies _",
    "( k ) & = & , m _ = [ omegatrpa ] .",
    "as happens in lswt , the final result in trpa contains no information about the short range fluctuations ( srf ) of the order parameter if the operator @xmath64 is replaced with the site independent average @xmath65 .",
    "( a discussion about the role of srf can be found in a recent review @xcite . ) in spite of that , trpa incorporates certain type of magnon - magnon interaction that renormalizes magnon mass according to ( [ omegatrpa ] ) .",
    "since the approximation is made directly in the equation of motion , an explicit form of magnon - magnon interactions that yield ( [ omegatrpa ] ) ca nt be deduced in tgf formalism .",
    "tyablikov s result ( [ omegatrpa ] ) for hfm was subsequently re - derived by linearizing the commutation relations for fourier components of @xmath66 operators @xcite similarly as in this section , using the perturbation theory for self - consistent mean field approximation @xcite , various diagram techniques for spin operators @xcite , drone - fermion for @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xcite and pseudofermion representation for spin @xmath69 ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "although both the spin - operator diagram technique and the pseudo / drone fermion representations eventually yield trpa result ( or improve it ) , non of these approaches describes hfm as a system of interacting magnons built on lswt as the non - interacting theory , i.e. using the perturbation theory for interacting magnon fields without additional mfa / rpa approximations .",
    "the issue of magnon - magnon interactions in trpa can be resolved by interpreting trpa as a certain type of eft . as a corollary",
    ", we will give a clear answer for the spurious @xmath32 term of tyablikov .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the lswt description of hfm is equivalent to a theory of free lattice schrdinger field .",
    "the rest of the present paper will be devoted to the influence of magnon - magnon interactions on microscopic and macroscopic properties of a ferromagnet .",
    "the simplest choice of the interaction for the schrdinger field , with the hamiltonian density @xmath70 ^ 2 $ ] simply wo nt work because the vertices of @xmath71 ^ 2 $ ] interaction carry no momentum , so it can not renormalize the mass of a ferromagnetic magnon . the correct form of the effective interaction",
    "is most easily formulated in terms of the goldstone fields @xmath72 .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the general effective lagrangian is written in terms of goldstone fields @xmath73 .",
    "various terms appearing in the effective lagrangian are organized in the powers of momenta of the goldstone fields .",
    "the leading order lagrangian collects all contributions of the order @xmath74 .",
    "if the system is invariant under parity , which is the case with the heisenberg hamiltonian ( [ hfm1 ] ) , only terms with even powers of momenta are permitted .",
    "the next - to - leading order lagrangian then contains all contributions of the order @xmath75 and so on .",
    "translated into the direct space , the powers of momenta correspond to the derivatives .",
    "the effective lagrangian is constructed by adding terms with increasing number of derivatives of the goldstone fields , with the lowest order term containing two derivatives .",
    "it should be noted that for systems whose massless excitations characterize nonrelativistic dispersion @xmath76 , such is hfm , single time derivative counts as @xmath74 , i.e. as two spatial derivatives or a single power of temperature @xcite .",
    "expansion in the powers of momentum is always terminated at some finite order and , beside goldstone fields and their derivatives , the effective lagrangian also includes several coupling constants whose values are not specified by the symmetry requirements .",
    "they can be determined by comparison of predictions of eft with numerical simulations , experimental results or by matching with detailed microscopic calculations @xcite .",
    "when the effective lagrangian is constructed , a straightforward application of feynmann rules enables one to calculate the correlation functions , partition function etc . for a heisenberg ferromagnet @xmath77 , and the spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    "is accompanied by two real goldstone fields @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "however , the ferromagnetic magnons possess nonrelativistic dispersion relation ( @xmath10 ) and a complex field @xmath80 describes a single magnon @xcite .",
    "effective lagrangian for hfm was introduced in @xcite ( see also earlier works @xcite ) , and a detailed derivation of the partition function up to the three loops using continuum approximation and the dimensional regularization , resulting with the leading corrections to dyson s analysis of 3d hfm , can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite for corresponding analysis of the two dimensional ferromagnet ) . in the present paper , a slightly modified path will be followed .",
    "as one of our interests lies in the mass renormalization of the lattice magnons , we wish to preserve the full discrete symmetry of lattice spin hamiltonian ( [ hfm1 ] ) .",
    "because of that , we find it more convenient to work in the hamiltonian formulation of lattice field theory @xcite , leaving only ( imaginary ) time coordinate continuous . therefore , the first task is to construct the effective hamiltonian that describes interactions of lattice magons with nonrelativistic dispersion .",
    "details for lattice regularization of the lorentz - invariant effective field theory can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the leading order real time effective lagrangian of o(3 ) ferromagnet is @xcite  _ = - _ u^i _ u^i , [ efflagr ] where two magnon fields are collected into the unit vector @xmath81^{\\text t } \\equiv [ \\bm \\pi ( x),u^3(x)]^{\\text t}$ ] , @xmath82 is the spontaneous magnetization per unit volume at @xmath83k and @xmath84 is a constant . the first part of lagrangian is usually denoted as wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term .",
    "it gives rise to the berry phase @xcite and is responsible for the classical dispersion of the ferromagnetic magnons ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the presence of wzw term makes lagrangian rotationally invariant only up to the total derivative .",
    "as it will be shown , the inclusion of magnon - magnon interactions arising from wzw term is crucial for correct low - temperature description of o(3 ) hfm . the next - to - leading order lagrangian contains terms such as @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , or @xmath88 with arbitrary coupling constants @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "these @xmath90 terms shall not be directly included in the effective hamiltonian . instead",
    ", higher order momentum contributions will appear naturally in a lattice regularized theory .",
    "this regularization , however , restricts possible choices for higher order terms ( see section [ rotsymlagr ] ) .",
    "the use of perturbation theory requires clear separation between the free - magnon part , which must be identified with ( [ diaglsw ] ) , and the interaction part of the hamiltonian @xcite . to extract them from the lagrangian ( [ efflagr ] ) ,",
    "we may rewrite it in terms of the complex field @xmath91 $ ] which describes the physical magnon , and follow the standard canonical prescription .",
    "however , this is not the most efficient way to construct interaction picture .",
    "the wzw term modifies canonical momentum , from @xmath92 of noninteracting theory , to @xmath93 $ ] , where @xmath94 .",
    "consequently , the complex fields @xmath95 and @xmath96 that enter hamiltonian are not those obeying equal - time commutation relations .",
    "as the connection between canonical momentum and @xmath96 is highly nonlinear it can be solved for @xmath96 only iteratively .",
    "because of that , an important part of magnon - magnon interactions is not manifest in the hamiltonian , since it enters the quantum theory through the failure of @xmath95 and @xmath96 to satisfy canonical schrdinger - field commutation relations .",
    "this is reminiscent of the situation dealt with in the spin - operator approach to heisenberg magnets : the commutation relations governing the dynamics of system are neither bose nor fermi type and the interaction is generated by expanding localized spins operators in terms of boson / fermion operators @xcite .",
    "for the present purposes , however , it is desirable to have an explicit form of the magnon - magnon interaction .    a different strategy @xcite makes use of the equation of motion , which in the present case is the landau - lifshitz equation @xcite , _",

    "the effective action for trpa lagrangian is no longer o(3 ) invariant .",
    "even though it was shown that space - rotation symmetry of leading order lagrangian guaranties absence of @xmath210 term ( see @xcite for @xmath143 ) , we see that it only does so if the full spin - rotational symmetry of effective action is preserved ( order by order , in the perturbative expansion ) .",
    "the importance of wzw term in effective lagrangian for ferromagnet was stressed in @xcite where it was shown that it is crucial for obtaining correct qualitative magnon spectrum in linear approximation .",
    "the present paper puts conclusions of @xcite a step forward in the sense that it is demonstrated how the thermodynamical properties of a ferromagnet depend on the magnon - magnon interactions generated by wzw term .",
    "the method of effective lagrangians is a powerful tool for analyzing the low - energy ( low temperature ) domain of models with strongly interacting constituents , provided spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "employed first for the description of low - energy sector of qcd , it soon found its way to the strongly correlated systems of condensed matter .",
    "a notable example for the latter class of systems is the isotropic heisenberg ferromagnet , exhibiting @xmath258 spontaneous breakdown of internal spin - rotation symmetry . due to a symmetry breakdown ,",
    "massless particles ( goldstone bosons ) appear in the spectrum . in the case of heisenberg magnets ,",
    "goldstone bosons are called magnons and for o(3 ) hfm , there are two broken generators and a single magnon .",
    "the eft line of reasoning then constitutes in writting the most general lagrangian ( i.e. action ) consistent with internal symmetries of the heisenberg hamiltonian , organized in the powers of momenta of goldstone fields . by employing appropriate feynman rules for time - ordered green s functions of the effective lagrangian",
    ", one can calculate free energy and other physical quantities of interest .",
    "eft is usually formulated in the functional integral framework using dimensional regularization .",
    "lattice regularization , however , enables the effective hamiltonian to inherit the full discrete symmetry of the original heisenberg ferromagnet which modifies the free magnon dispersion from @xmath259 to @xmath260 . in the spirit of chiral perturbation theory , where original quark and gluons of qcd are replaced with goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry",
    ", no reference is made to the original degrees of freedom , i. e. to the localized spins .",
    "the theory includes bosonic ( magnon ) fields from the beginning .",
    "because of that , calculations in lattice eft are free of certain types of approximations unavoidable in approaches relaying on equations of motion for spin operators or on their bosonic / fermionic representations .",
    "a vital part of our analysis is careful inclusion of the magnon - magnon interactions arising from the wzw term in the effective lagrangian .",
    "calculations in eft reduce to evaluation of various feynman diagrams involving propagators of goldstone fields . as",
    "goldstone fields are derivatively coupled , the lattice regularization necessary induces diagrams containing at least one lattice laplacian acting on propagators .",
    "the number of lattice laplacians increases with the order of diagram , i.e. with number of loops .",
    "the structure of diagrams becomes even more involved if interaction part of hamiltonian consists of several terms different in derivative structure since more than one lattice laplacian may act on given propagator , as in the present paper . to get around these complications as much as possible ,",
    "we have devised a variant of feynman diagrams suitable for scalar fields with derivative couplings .",
    "they are applicable for lattice as well for continuum field theories .",
    "corresponding feynman rules are based on colored lines and vertices and are exposed in section [ diagrammar ] .",
    "all calculations in the present paper rely on this version of feynman diagrams .",
    "once the effective hamiltonian of lattice magnon fields is found , it can be used to study magnon - magnon interactions and their influence on magnon self energy , spontaneous magnetization and free energy of @xmath4 hmf .",
    "we have shown in section [ se2loop ] that the dyson s correction to the spontaneous magnetization can be obtained from one - loop correction to the magnon propagator , bypassing discussion on the free energy .",
    "the approach simplifies calculations and opens direct link to the standard theories of spin waves in the heisenberg ferromagnet .",
    "in particular , using eft , we have established connection between theories on nonlinear spin waves , tyablikov gf method and importance of magnon - magnon interactions originating in the wzw term .",
    "it is also shown in section [ se2loop ] that , similarly to pions in lorentz - invariant models , ferromagnetic magnons remain `` massless '' at two - loop .",
    "further analysis of three - loop corrections to the free energy of hfm , presented in sections [ 3lfe ] and [ rotsymlagr ] , reveals how magnon - magnon interactions manifest themselves in the low - temperature series for free energy .",
    "the two - loop correction yields terms proportional to @xmath183 , @xmath246 and so on , while the three - loop corrections start with term proportional to @xmath261 powers of temperature . discussion from section [ rotsymlagr ] shows how interplay between the number of loops and the spatial dimensionality of the lattice dictates structure of this low - temperature series .",
    "we also present numerical values for coefficients of @xmath253 term in case of 3,4,5 and 6-dimensional lattice along with general expression valid for all @xmath4 .",
    "while results for @xmath143 are found to be in excellent agreement with recent literature , those for @xmath262 and 6 are completely new .",
    "the use of hamiltonian formalism leads to certain simplifications in diagrammatic series for the free energy , as well as for the magnon self - energy , since six - magnon vertices precisely cancel to all orders in @xmath228 .",
    "also , using colored diagrams , we have shown that certain two and three - loop diagrams for free energy vanish . at the end of section [ rotsymlagr ]",
    "we show that spurious @xmath263 term in the low - temperature expansion of spontaneous magnetization characterizes theories inconsistent with internal o(3 ) symmetry of @xmath0 dimensional hfm .",
    "for example , explicit breakdown of o(3 ) symmetry in tyablikov rpa is caused by neglection of magnon - magnon interactions of the form @xmath264 generated solely by the wzw term , thus making trpa a theory of pure bosonic lattice schrdinger field .",
    "this becomes especially clear when trpa effective theory is put in the form given in the appendix [ apprpa ] .    the heisenberg model and",
    "the spin waves on hypercubic lattice have been studied in the past .",
    "these papers , however , focus on general properties of magnetic systems on hypercubic lattices , such as existence of the landau - lifshitz equation @xcite . also , their analysis relies on mf approximations @xcite , coupled - cluster @xcite and @xmath172 @xcite expansion or rg methods @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we investigate the low - energy magnon - magnon interactions in detail .",
    "explicit expressions describing their influence on the magnon self energy , the ferromagnet free energy and the spontaneous magnetization are presented in the paper .",
    "we also discuss subtleties concerning the influence of spatial dimensionality of the lattice and the number of loops entering the low - temperature expansion of ferromagnet free energy , which can not be found in earlier works .    to conclude",
    ", we may say that the lattice regularization offers new perspectives on eft approach to heisenberg ferromagnet . by keeping full magnon dispersion",
    "it extends eft range of validity at not too low temperatures .",
    "it also makes comparison between eft results and those of nonlinear spin waves / trpa direct and precise . finally ,",

    "<S> we present the perturbation theory for lattice magnon fields of @xmath0-dimensional o(3 ) heisenberg ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> the effective hamiltonian for the lattice magnon fields is obtained starting from the effective lagrangian , with two dominant contributions that describe magnon - magnon interactions identified as a usual gradient term for the unit vector field and a part originating in the wess - zumino - witten term of effective lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> feynman diagrams for lattice scalar fields with derivative couplings are introduced , on basis of which we investigate the influence of magnon - magnon interactions on magnon self - energy and ferromagnet free energy . </S>",
    "<S> we also comment appearance of spurious terms in the low - temperature series for the free energy by examining magnon - magnon interactions and internal symmetry of the effective hamiltonian ( lagrangian ) . </S>"
