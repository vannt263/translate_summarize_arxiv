    "the karmen collaboration , which studies the interactions of neutrinos from the stopped @xmath6 decay chain at rutherford appelton laboratory , has reported an anomaly @xcite in the time distribution of neutrino events in the karmen calorimeter .",
    "there is a bump of events in the distribution which was expected to be well described by a single exponential with a time constant equal to the muon decay lifetime .",
    "it was suggested that a new weakly - interacting half spin particle with a mass 33.9 mev / c@xmath7 from initial @xmath8 decay , which travels with velocity @xmath9 and decays in the karmen calorimeter after a mean flight path of 17.5 metres , can be a possible candidate for an explanation of this anomaly .   since the visible energy in the calorimeter was in the range from 11 to 35 mev it was also assumed that these new particles deposited only a fraction of their full energy in the calorimeter .",
    "the hypothetical @xmath8 decay has been searched for at psi by studying muons from pion decay in flight @xcite .",
    "the result gives a branching ratio of less than @xmath10 at 95@xmath11 confidence level ( c.l . ) for this decay mode leaving only a narrow allowed region in the branching ratio if combined with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another possible interpretation of the anomaly proposed by the karmen collaboration is related to the direct production of a new particle in the proton collision with the neutrino target .",
    "however , the collaboration has not yet stated whether it has devised one .    concerning the possible explanation of the anomaly by exotic muon decays it was concluded that `` ... the narrow clustering of the anomalous events rules out contributions from @xmath0 decay , which spreads over a much longer time interval ( compared to the @xmath6 - life time of @xmath12 ) up to 10 @xmath1 after beam - on target . ''",
    "@xcite .",
    "this conclusion is the motivation for present letter , where we show that the karmen anomaly could be explained by contributions from the exotic @xmath0 decays .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we analyse the time distribution obtained by the karmen collaboration and give a possible explanation of the anomaly .  as an example we consider the @xmath3 decay into a positron and a new boson with the mass of 103.9 mev/c@xmath7.in sections 3,4",
    "the possible x - boson phenomenologies and experiments on searching for the rare decay @xmath3 are discussed , respectively .",
    "section 5 contains concluding remarks .",
    "figure 1 shows the time distribution found by karmen with respect to beam - on target events .",
    "analysis of this time distribution was performed in ref.@xcite after subtraction of the cosmic ray induced background , which was found to be constant and equal to 60 events per 0.5 @xmath1 .",
    "this spectrum was fitted in ref .",
    "@xcite by a superposition of gaussian and exponential signals from muon decay neutrinos having a 2.2 @xmath1 decay constant .",
    "the fit procedure performed with the minimization routines of minuit @xcite results in @xmath13 of 9.7 for 14 degrees of freedom ( df ) corresponding to 79@xmath11 c.l . for this hypothesis.gaussian , which is centred at @xmath14 with a full width at half maximum(fwhm ) of @xmath15 consisted of 83@xmath1628 events associated with the signals from decay in flight of the proposed particle in the fiducial volume of the karmen calorimeter .",
    "we tried to reproduce these results by using the same minuit minimizing routines .   our results and results of the karmen fit",
    "were found to be in a good agreement : our fit procedure yielded @xmath13 of 9.8 for 14 degrees of freedom ( df ) corresponding to 77@xmath11 c.l . for this hypothesis.gaussian was found to be centred at @xmath17 with a fwhm of @xmath15 and with 85@xmath1632 events .",
    "the result of our fit procedure is shown in figure 1 . having this good agreement in mind",
    ", we then performed an exponential fit of the karmen time distribution assuming that this spectrum is described by a sum of two exponentials : the first exponential describes the time distribution in the interval 1 - 3.3 @xmath1 , and the second one describes the time distribution in the interval 3.3 - 10 @xmath1 .",
    "figure 2 shows the result of the fit ( solid lines).the minuit minimizing routines yield a @xmath18 of 9.7 for 15 df corresponding to 84@xmath11 c.l . , and time constants of @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the first and the second exponentials respectively .",
    "note that there is no significant difference in confidence levels of our and karmen s hypotheses .",
    "the time width of the transition region between two exponentials is rather small and corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "we try to fit this region more precisely using a gaussian shape of the transition curve instead of a step - function .",
    "however , no significant difference between two results has been found .",
    "a similar description of the time distribution was obtained by superimposing an exponential describing the distribution of events in the time interval 3.3 - 10 @xmath1 upon an exponential signal having a 2.2 @xmath1 decay constant for the full time interval .",
    "figure 3 shows the corresponding time distribution of events after subtraction of the exponential part with 2.2 @xmath1 .",
    "a direct exponential fit of the time distribution of events in this region gives a time constant of 2.26 @xmath1 close to the value of muon decay constant ; however the error is rather large because of poor statistics .",
    "since the time constants were found to be equal within the error limits to the muon decay constant we may assume that all events in the karmen time distribution originate from the muon decays .",
    "thus , our interpretation of the karmen anomaly is the following .",
    "positive muons from @xmath6 decays stop in the target ( muon range in the target is @xmath22 1 cm ) and decay giving a flux of neutrinos which decreases in time exponentially with the muon decay constant .",
    "the first exponential shown in the time spectrum in figure 2 is related to the interactions of this flux of neutrinos in the karmen calorimeter.an excess of events after @xmath23 3.6 @xmath1 shown in figure 3 is related to the decays of slow moving particles produced in muon decays.therefore , the flux of these particles and fraction of their decays in the fiducial volume of the karmen calorimeter also decrease in time exponentially with the muon decay constant , resulting in the second time distribution but shifted by the time of flight with respect to the time distribution of neutrino events .",
    "since the time width of the transition region between two exponentials is rather narrow ( see figure 2 ) , we suggest that these new particles originate from the two - body decays of positive muons , namely @xmath24 .",
    "we note that the rms of fluctuations of time needed for @xmath4 bosons to pass from the neutrino target to the calorimeter and decay inside its volume was estimated to be of the order of 0.2 @xmath1 .  the effect of the convolution of these fluctuations and the exponential from muon decay on the exponential shape of this curve and its decay constant was found to be small .",
    "the mass of the @xmath4 boson calculated for @xmath25 is found to be ( 103.9@xmath160.1 ) mev / c@xmath7 , where the error corresponds to the spread of @xmath4 s velocity estimated from the time width of the transition region between two exponentials .",
    "the excess of events after subtraction of the contribution from the neutrino was found to be @xmath26 events .",
    "the limit on branching ratio @xmath27 as a function of the @xmath4-boson lifetime can be recalculated from the karmen result for @xmath28 decay mode taking into account the difference in the number of excess events found after the fit procedure .",
    "the result is shown in figure 4 .",
    "suppose that x - boson is a neutral scalar particle .",
    "the lagrangian describing the @xmath29 decay has the form @xmath30\\ ] ] the @xmath29 decay width is given by the formula @xmath31^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] for a non - relativistic x - boson with a speed @xmath32 we find that its mass is @xmath33 mev and the @xmath29 branching ratio is @xmath34\\ ] ] for the interaction ( 1 ) the x - boson decays via the virtual @xmath35 meson @xmath36 and its decay width is @xmath37    as it follows from the observed number of the anomalous events due to the x - boson decay in the karmen experiment , the ratio @xmath38 is @xmath39 from the formulae ( 2 -6 ) we find that @xmath40 and @xmath41 , that is probably at the level of the contradiction with the experimental bound @xcite @xmath42 which is valid however for @xmath43 mev ( see section 4 ) .",
    "it is possible to invent a model where the @xmath44 is less than @xmath45 .",
    "let us introduce the hypothetical heavy charged lepton l and consider the decay of the x - boson through the virtual charged l - lepton @xmath46 for the l - lepton mass @xmath47 gev , the coupling constant of l - lepton with electron and x - boson @xmath48 , the l - lepton mixing with electron @xmath49 , we find that @xmath50 .",
    "so , if our interpretation of the karmen anomaly is correct we expect a rather large branching ratio @xmath51",
    ".  therefore , it would be very interesting to perform an experiment on the search for @xmath29 decay with improved sensitivity .",
    "these scenarios predict the x - boson lifetime @xmath52 s that probably leads to problems with astrophysical and cosmological constraints .",
    "moreover , these scenarios predict an anomalously high x - boson decay energy @xmath53 mev compared to the observed visible energy @xmath54 mev .    to avoid these problems ,",
    "let us consider the model with two additional neutral scalar bosons @xmath55 and @xmath56 and suppose that the @xmath55-boson is lighter than the x - boson and the @xmath56-boson is heavier than the x - boson .",
    "the lagrangian describing the x - boson decay has the form @xmath57 the x - boson decays via the reaction @xmath58 through the virtual @xmath56-boson and the neutral @xmath55-boson decays into neutrino antineutrino pair .",
    "for such a scenario it is possible to have @xmath59 mev and @xmath60 s. for instance , for @xmath33 mev , @xmath61 mev , @xmath62 gev , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 we find that the average visible energy in the x - decay is @xmath66 mev and @xmath67 s , @xmath68 s , @xmath69 , @xmath70 s. so in this rather artificial model all particles are not long - lived and it is possible to have @xmath71 in agreement with karmen data .",
    "note also that it is possible to have a model where the @xmath56-boson is the higgs boson .",
    "for instance , for the higgs boson mass @xmath72 gev and @xmath73 we find that @xmath74 s and @xmath75 . in this case to have @xmath60 s we have to postulate an additional interaction of the @xmath4-boson with neutrinos .",
    "since @xmath4 s are weakly - interacting and relatively long lived particles , their flux would penetrate any type of calorimeter without significant attenuation and can not be observed effectively in the detector via its decays .",
    "a more effective experimental signature for @xmath76 decays would be a peak from mono - energetic positrons in the low energy part of the positron spectrum corresponding to the principal mode of @xmath77 decays .",
    "direct experimental searches for a peak from @xmath78 decays were performed in a few experiments @xcite .   for the lowest positron energy region from 1.6 to 6.8 mev ,",
    "corresponding to the mass region of 103.5 - 98.3 mev / c@xmath7 , the branching ratio limit of @xmath79 was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the analysis of published data on muon decays in the hydrogen bubble chamber obtained by derenzo @xcite .",
    "the result is limited by a poor ( @xmath22 30 - 40@xmath11 ) momentum resolution in this region .",
    "it would be interesting to search for a peak in the low energy part of the positron spectrum by using , for example , a high resolution ge - detector ( nai detector ) with a typical energy resolution of the order of kev ( @xmath22 100 kev ) .",
    "the low energy muons could be stopped in the active volume of the detector .  in this case",
    "the low energy spectrum of the positrons could be measured without significant distortions .",
    "the estimate of the rate from the principal muon decays shows that , using ge - detector , one could expect a sensitivity to the @xmath76 decay branching ratio of better than @xmath80 .",
    "here it is assumed that the intensity of stops is of the order of @xmath81/s and that the exposure to the muon beam is @xmath22 1 month .",
    "the anomalous time distribution of the events from the karmen detector can be acceptably described by a superposition of the time distribution of neutrino signals following the expected 2.2 @xmath1 muon decay constant and a weaker exponential signal from delayed decays of the new massive neutral particles also originated from the muon decay at rest and shifted in time due to their time of flight .",
    "it is proposed that a new boson @xmath4 with the mass of 103.9 mev / c@xmath7 which might be produced in the decays of positive muons @xmath3 could be a possible candidate for an explanation of the anomaly .",
    "the visible energy from the possible decay modes of @xmath4 s can be within the allowed region from 11 to 35 mev / c@xmath7 .",
    "this hypothesis can be experimentally tested in the near future at a level of sensitivity of better than 10@xmath82 .",
    "it should be noted that the original interpretation of the karmen anomaly as a new neutral fermion @xmath83 produced in @xmath84 decay with a mass @xmath85 mev has been discussed in ref .",
    "it has been shown that a mainly sterile neutrino scenario is compatible with all laboratory constraints , although there are problems with astrophysical and cosmological constraints .",
    "our interpretation with the scalar @xmath4-boson produced in the @xmath86 decay is in the spirit of the familon scenario @xcite .",
