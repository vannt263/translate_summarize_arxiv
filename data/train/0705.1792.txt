    "consider a compact oriented surface @xmath0 of genus @xmath1 together with a finite subset @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 .",
    "the moduli space @xmath4 is the set of all @xmath5-pointed riemann surfaces of genus @xmath1 up to isomorphism .",
    "its universal cover can be identified with the teichmller space @xmath6 , which parametrizes complex structures on @xmath0 up to isotopy ( relative to @xmath5 ) ; equivalently , @xmath6 parametrizes isomorphism classes of @xmath7-marked riemann surfaces .",
    "thus , @xmath4 is the quotient of @xmath6 under the action of the mapping class group @xmath8 .",
    "as @xmath6 is contractible ( teichmller @xcite ) , we also have that @xmath9 . however , @xmath10 acts on @xmath6 discontinuously but with finite stabilizers .",
    "thus , @xmath4 is naturally an orbifold and @xmath9 must be intended in the orbifold category .      as compact riemann surfaces are complex algebraic curves",
    ", @xmath4 has an algebraic structure and is in fact a deligne - mumford stack , which is the algebraic analogue of an orbifold .",
    "the underlying space @xmath11 ( forgetting the isotropy groups ) is a quasi - projective variety .",
    "the interest for enumerative geometry of algebraic curves naturally led to seeking for a suitable compactification of @xmath4 .",
    "deligne and mumford @xcite understood that it was sufficient to consider algebraic curves with mild singularities to compactify @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , their compactification @xmath12 is the moduli space of @xmath5-pointed stable ( algebraic ) curves of genus @xmath1 , where a complex projective curve @xmath13 is `` stable '' if its only singularities are nodes ( that is , in local analytic coordinates @xmath13 looks like @xmath14 ) and every irreducible component of the smooth locus of @xmath15 has negative euler characteristic .    the main tool to prove the completeness of @xmath12 is the stable reduction theorem , which essentially says that a smooth holomorphic family @xmath16 of @xmath5-pointed riemann surfaces of genus @xmath1 over the pointed disc can be completed to a family over @xmath17 ( after a suitable change of base @xmath18 ) using a stable curve .",
    "the beauty of @xmath12 is that it is smooth ( as an orbifold ) and that its coarse space @xmath19 is a projective variety ( mumford @xcite , gieseker @xcite , knudsen @xcite @xcite , kollr @xcite and cornalba @xcite ) .",
    "the map @xmath20 that forgets the @xmath21-point can be identified to the universal curve over @xmath12 and is the first example of tautological map .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 has a natural algebraic stratification , in which each stratum corresponds to a topological type of curve : for instance , smooth curves correspond to the open stratum @xmath4 . as another example : irreducible curves with one node correspond to an irreducible locally closed subvariety of ( complex ) codimension @xmath22 , which is the image of the ( generically @xmath23 ) tautological boundary map @xmath24 that glues @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "thus , every stratum is the image of a ( finite - to - one ) tautological boundary map , and thus is isomorphic to a finite quotient of a product of smaller moduli spaces .",
    "teichmller theorists are more interested in compactifying @xmath6 rather than @xmath4 .",
    "one of the most popular way to do it is due to thurston ( see @xcite ) : the boundary of @xmath6 is thus made of projective measured laminations and it is homeomorphic to a sphere .",
    "clearly , there can not be any clear link between a compactification of @xmath6 and of @xmath4 , as the infinite discrete group @xmath10 would not act discontinuously on a compact boundary @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the @xmath10-equivariant bordification of @xmath6 whose quotient is @xmath4 can not be compact . a way to understand it is to endow @xmath4 ( and @xmath6 ) with the weil - petersson metric @xcite and to show that its completion is exactly @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "hence , the weil - petersson completion @xmath28 can be identified to the set of @xmath7-marked stable riemann surfaces .",
    "similarly to @xmath12 , also @xmath28 has a stratification by topological type and each stratum is a ( finite quotient of a ) product of smaller teichmller spaces .",
    "the moduli space @xmath12 comes equipped with natural vector bundles : for instance , @xmath29 is the holomorphic line bundle whose fiber at @xmath30 $ ] is @xmath31 .",
    "chern classes of these line bundles and their push - forward through tautological maps generate the so - called tautological classes ( which can be seen in the chow ring or in cohomology ) .",
    "the @xmath32 classes were first defined by mumford @xcite and morita @xcite and then modified ( to make them behave better under tautological maps ) by arbarello and cornalba @xcite .",
    "the @xmath33 classes were defined by e.miller @xcite and their importance was successively rediscovered by witten @xcite .",
    "the importance of the tautological classes is due to the following facts ( among others ) :    * their geometric meaning appears quite clear * they behave very naturally under the tautological maps ( see , for instance , @xcite ) * they often occur in computations of enumerative geometry ; that is , poincar duals of interesting algebraic loci are often tautological ( see @xcite ) but not always ( see @xcite ) ! * they are defined on @xmath12 for every @xmath1 and @xmath5 ( provided @xmath34 ) , and they generate the stable cohomology ring over @xmath35 due to madsen - weiss s solution @xcite of mumford s conjecture ( see section  [ ss : stability ] ) * there is a set of generators ( @xmath33 s and @xmath32 s ) which have non - negativity properties ( see @xcite and @xcite ) * they are strictly related to the weil - petersson geometry of @xmath12 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "one way to analyze the ( co)homology of @xmath4 , and so of @xmath10 , is to construct a highly connected simplicial complex on which @xmath10 acts .",
    "this is usually achieved by considering complexes of disjoint , pairwise non - homotopic simple closed curves on @xmath36 with suitable properties ( for instance , harvey s complex of curves @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath5 is nonempty ( or if @xmath0 has boundary ) , then one can construct a complex using systems of homotopically nontrivial , disjoint arcs joining two ( not necessarily distinct ) points in @xmath5 ( or in @xmath37 ) , thus obtaining the arc complex @xmath38 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it has an `` interior '' @xmath39 made of systems of arcs that cut @xmath36 in discs ( or pointed discs ) and a complementary `` boundary '' @xmath40 .",
    "an important result , which has many fathers ( harer - mumford - thurston @xcite , penner @xcite , bowditch - epstein @xcite ) , says that @xmath41 is @xmath10-equivariantly homeomorphic to @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 is the standard simplex in @xmath44 ) .",
    "thus , we can transfer the cell structure of @xmath41 to an ( orbi)cell structure on @xmath45 .",
    "the homeomorphism is realized by coherently associating a weighted system of arcs to every @xmath5-marked riemann surface , equipped with a decoration @xmath46 .",
    "there are two traditional ways to do this : using the flat structure arising from a jenkins - strebel quadratic differential ( harer - mumford - thurston ) with prescribed residues at @xmath5 or using the hyperbolic metric coming from the uniformization theorem ( penner and bowditch - epstein ) .",
    "quite recently , several other ways have been introduced ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .      to better understand the homeomorphism between @xmath41 and @xmath47 , it is often convenient to adopt a dual point of view , that is to think of weighted systems of arcs as of metrized graphs @xmath48 , embedded in @xmath36 through a homotopy equivalence .",
    "this can be done by picking a vertex in each disc cut by the system of arcs and joining these vertices by adding an edge transverse to each arc .",
    "what we obtain is an @xmath7-marked metrized ribbon graph .",
    "thus , points in @xmath49 correspond to metrized @xmath5-marked ribbon graphs of genus @xmath1 .",
    "this point of view is particularly useful to understand singular surfaces ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the object dual to a weighted system of arcs in @xmath40 is a collection of data that we called an @xmath7-marked `` enriched '' ribbon graph .",
    "notice that an @xmath5-marked `` enriched '' metrized ribbon graph does not carry all the information needed to construct a stable riemann surface .",
    "hence , the map @xmath50 is not a injective on the locus of singular curves , but still it is a homeomorphism on a dense open subset .",
    "the utility of the @xmath10-equivariant homotopy equivalence @xmath51 is the possibility of making topological computations on @xmath41 .",
    "for instance , harer @xcite determined the virtual cohomological dimension of @xmath10 ( and so of @xmath4 ) using the high connectivity of @xmath52 and he has established that @xmath10 is a virtual duality group , by showing that @xmath52 is spherical .",
    "an analysis of the singularities of @xmath53 is in @xcite .",
    "successively , harer - zagier @xcite and penner @xcite have computed the orbifold euler characteristic of @xmath4 , where by `` orbifold '' we mean that a cell with stabilizer @xmath54 has euler characteristic @xmath55 .",
    "because of the cellularization , the problem translates into enumerating @xmath5-marked ribbon graphs of genus @xmath1 and counting them with the correct sign .",
    "techniques for enumerating graphs and ribbon graphs ( see , for instance , @xcite ) have been known to physicists for long time : they use asymptotic expansions of gaussian integrals over spaces of matrices .",
    "the combinatorics of iterated integrations by parts is responsible for the appearance of ( ribbon ) graphs ( wick s lemma ) .",
    "thus , the problem of computing @xmath56 can be reduced to evaluating a matrix integral ( a quick solution is also given by kontsevich in appendix  d of @xcite ) .      as @xmath45",
    "is not just homotopy equivalent to @xmath57 but actually homeomorphic ( through a piecewise - linear real - analytic diffeomorphism ) , it is clear that one can try to rephrase integrals over @xmath4 as integrals over @xmath57 , that is as sums over maximal systems of arcs of integrals over a single simplex .",
    "this approach looked promising in order to compute weil - petersson volumes ( see penner @xcite ) .",
    "kontsevich @xcite used it to compute volumes coming from a `` symplectic form '' @xmath58 , thus solving witten s conjecture @xcite on the intersection numbers of the @xmath33 classes .",
    "however , in witten s paper @xcite matrix integrals entered in a different way .",
    "the idea was that , in order to integrate over the space of all conformal structures on @xmath0 , one can pick a random decomposition of @xmath0 into polygons , give each polygon a natural euclidean structure and extend it to a conformal structure on @xmath0 , thus obtaining a `` random '' point of @xmath4 .",
    "refining the polygonalization of @xmath0 leads to a measure on @xmath4 .",
    "matrix integrals are used to enumerate these polygonalizations .",
    "witten also noticed that this refinement procedure may lead to different limits , depending on which polygons we allow .",
    "for instance , we can consider decompositions into @xmath59 squares , or into @xmath59 squares and @xmath60 hexagons , and so on .",
    "dualizing this last polygonalization , we obtain ribbon graphs embedded in @xmath0 with @xmath59 vertices of valence @xmath61 and @xmath60 vertices of valence @xmath62 . the corresponding locus in @xmath41",
    "is called a witten subcomplex .",
    "kontsevich @xcite and penner @xcite proved that witten subcomplexes obtained by requiring that the ribbon graphs have @xmath63 vertices of valence @xmath64 can be oriented ( see also @xcite ) and they give cycles in @xmath65 , which are denoted by @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67-volumes of these @xmath66 are also computable using matrix integrals @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "kontsevich constructed similar cycles using structure constants of finite - dimensional cyclic @xmath68-algebras with positive - definite scalar product and he also claimed that the classes @xmath69 ( restriction of @xmath66 to @xmath4 ) are poincar dual to tautological classes .    this last statement ( usually called witten - kontsevich s conjecture ) was settled independently by igusa @xcite @xcite and mondello @xcite , while very little is known about the nature of the ( non - homogeneous ) @xmath70-classes .",
    "the key point of all constructions of a ribbon graph out of a surface is that @xmath5 must be nonempty , so that @xmath36 can be retracted by deformation onto a graph .",
    "in fact , it is not difficult to see that the spine construction of penner and bowditch - epstein can be performed ( even in a more natural way ) on hyperbolic surfaces @xmath71 with geodesic boundary .",
    "the associated cellularization of the corresponding moduli space is due to luo @xcite ( for smooth surfaces ) and by mondello @xcite ( also for singular surfaces , using luo s result ) .",
    "the interesting fact ( see @xcite and @xcite ) is that gluing semi - infinite cylinders at @xmath72 produces ( conformally ) punctured surfaces that `` interpolate '' between hyperbolic surfaces with cusps and flat surfaces arising from jenkins - strebel differentials .      in sections  [ ss : arcs ] and [ ss : ribbon ]",
    ", we carefully define systems of arcs and ribbon graphs , both in the singular and in the nonsingular case , and we explain how the duality between the two works . moreover , we recall harer s results on @xmath39 and @xmath40 and we state a simple criterion for compactness inside @xmath57 .    in sections  [ ss : deligne - mumford ] and",
    "[ ss : system ] , we describe the deligne - mumford moduli space of curves and the structure of its boundary , the associated stratification and boundary maps . in [ ss : augmented ] , we explain how the analogous bordification of the teichmller space @xmath28 can be obtained as completion with respect to the weil - petersson metric .    tautological classes and rings are introduced in [ ss : tautological ] and kontsevich s compactification of @xmath4 is described in [ ss : konts ] .    in [ ss : hmt ] , we explain and sketch a proof of harer - mumford - thurston cellularization of the moduli space and we illustrate the analogous result of penner - bowditch - epstein in [ ss : pbe ] . in [ ss : boundary ] , we quickly discuss the relations between the two constructions using hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary .",
    "in [ ss : witten ] , we define witten subcomplexes and witten cycles and we prove ( after kontsevich ) that @xmath67 orients them .",
    "we sketch the ideas involved in the proof the witten cycles are tautological in section  [ ss : witten - tautological ] .",
    "finally , in [ ss : stability ] , we recall harer s stability theorem and we exhibit a combinatorial construction that shows that witten cycles are stable .",
    "the fact ( and probably also the construction ) is well - known and it is also a direct consequence of witten - kontsevich s conjecture and miller s work .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank shigeyuki morita , athanase papadopoulos and robert c.  penner for the stimulating workshop `` teichmller space ( classical and quantum ) ''",
    "they organized in oberwolfach ( may 28th - june 3rd , 2006 ) and the mfo for the hospitality .",
    "i would like to thank enrico arbarello for all i learnt from him about riemann surfaces and for his constant encouragement .",
