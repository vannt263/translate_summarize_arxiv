    "the bulk properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions are of interest to both nuclear physics and astrophysics . to generate these conditions ,",

    "a function of beam energy , is sensitive to the forces underlying the dynamics of these collisions .",
    "thus its study can yield valuable information about the complex interplay of the repulsive nature of the hard scattering nucleon cross section , the repulsion and attraction of the nuclear mean field , and the repulsive contribution of the coulomb force .",
    "the buu ( boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ) @xcite transport model is successful in reproducing and predicting experimental magnitudes and trends in collective single - particle observables @xcite , such as the balance energy , and we use it here .",
    "buu is a theory for the single - particle phase space distribution of baryons ( plus resonances and mesons ) . in its most popular numerical realization",
    ", the model propagates test particles with hamilton s equations through the influence of experimentally observed nucleon collision cross sections @xcite , the coulomb field , and a nuclear mean field based on a skyrme - type interaction @xcite which typically depends upon local density and momentum .",
    "however , the inter - nucleon potential is not symmetric with respect to the isospin of the nucleon .",
    "protons and neutrons experience different forces due to their constituents .",
    "this means that an asymmetry term exists in the nuclear mean - field .",
    "in addition , the nucleon cross section is modified from its vacuum values in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "work by mller and serot @xcite has shown that the liquid - gas phase transition may in fact be of second rather than first order .",
    "their work , based upon a thermodynamic approach , demonstrated that local chemical instabilities are responsible for the transition when an asymmetric potential is used .",
    "this contrasts with the common view that mechanical instabilities are responsible for the onset of fragmentation in excited , diffuse systems .",
    "studies using the percolation model @xcite also have been used to explore the isospin degree of freedom in the nuclear fragmentation transition @xcite .",
    "the new experimental facilities coming on - line which will probe heavy - ion dynamics near the drip lines affords an opportunity to explore these results .    in stellar evolution",

    "however , if the proton density exceeds a critical value between 11% and 15% , which is dependent upon the symmetry energy , the direct urca process can occur and become the dominant cooling mechanism@xcite : @xmath3 .",
    "the exploration of the isospin degree of freedom in heavy ion collision thus carries the promise that it will help determine the answers to these questions of astrophysical relevance @xcite .",
    "recently , it was experimentally shown @xcite that the balance energy for symmetric systems of equal mass has different values for different isospin asymmetry of the colliding nuclei . in this paper",
    "we therefore study the isospin - dependence of the balance energy , attempt to isolate its origin , and hope to find sensitivity to the isospin - dependence of the nuclear mean field .",
    "the buu transport equation evolves in time a single nucleon phase - space distribution under the influences of nucleon - nucleon collisions , the coulomb field , and a nuclear mean field . in this study , we choose two mean fields : one recently used by bao - an li , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( also see ref.@xcite ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the normal nuclear density , @xmath6 is the neutron density , @xmath7 is the proton density , and @xmath8 is the isospin factor which is @xmath9 for neutrons and @xmath10 for protons .",
    "coefficients @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are typically chosen to match the ground state properties of symmetric nuclear matter such as the saturation density and saturation binding energy .",
    "the compressibility is a free parameter , and in this study we chose it to be @xmath14  mev .",
    "this gives @xmath15  mev , @xmath16  mev , and @xmath17 . in keeping with bao - an li s work , @xmath18  mev .",
    "the other mean field is derived from a hamiltonian due to sobotka @xcite : @xmath19 here the coefficients @xmath20  mev , @xmath21 and @xmath22  mev and @xmath23 is the kinetic energy term .",
    "neutrons are acted upon by : @xmath24 whereas protons are affected by : @xmath25 in symmetric matter , this mean field reduces to the often - called `` stiff '' equation of state ( compressibility @xmath26  mev ) . it should be noted that there is no transformation of the mean field of sobotka that will yield an equivalent `` soft '' equation of state .",
    "thus direct comparisons between the two formulations are impossible .",
    "one may simply alter @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in equation[equation : limeanfield ] to give the appropriate compressibility in symmetric matter .    with the isospin asymmetry @xmath27 and the reduced density @xmath28 equations[equation : limeanfield ] and [ equation : sobmean ]",
    "can be written as : @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the neutron potential , and @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are as defined above .",
    "figure[fig : one ] ( left side ) shows equation[equation : lidelta ] as neutron excess and normalized nuclear density are varied .",
    "the right side of the same figure shows equation[equation : sobdelta ] as neutron excess and normalized nuclear density are varied .",
    "one can see that equation[equation : sobdelta ] is more attractive to neutrons in the midst of proton - rich matter for all densities than equation[equation : lidelta ] .",
    "other parameterization of nuclear mean field potential also exist , @xcite but were not considered here .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon cross sections are parameterization from the particle data group@xcite with medium modification implemented according to the density dependent prescription : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the logarithmic derivative of the in - medium cross section with respect to the density , taken at @xmath37 , @xmath38 it is the lowest coefficient of a taylor - expansion of the cross - section in powers of the density @xcite .",
    "this is a parameterization of the pauli - blocking of intermediate states is motivated by brckner @xmath39-matrix theory @xcite .",
    "one can show @xcite that values of @xmath36 in the range between @xmath40 and @xmath41 yield the best agreement of the simple parameterization used here and the more involved @xmath39-matrix calculation using a realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that an in - medium reduction of @xmath42 provides the best reproduction of the flow signals of symmetric collisions for a broad range of energies and projectile - target combinations @xcite .",
    "before we proceed to show our numerical results , it is appropriate to attempt to understand the reasons why we would expect a difference in the balance energy for symmetric systems of equal mass , but different isospin .",
    "there are three isospin effects that we may consider : the average effective nucleon - nucleon cross section , the difference in the coulomb potential , and the isospin dependence of the mean field .    in order to understand the sign of the different effects , we first remind ourselves that the balance energy marks the beam energy at which the repulsive and attractive interactions are roughly equal . at",
    "beam energies lower than the balance energy , the attractive interaction dominates , and at energies higher than the balance energy , repulsive interactions determine the flow .",
    "the difference in the coulomb interaction is very simple .",
    "fe has 26 protons and ni 28 .",
    "this means that the ratio of the coulomb forces is @xmath43 = 0.862 .",
    "since the coulomb force adds repulsion , we thus expect that the balance energy for nickel should be lower than for iron .",
    "the difference in the isospin dependent mean field has the opposite effect .",
    "the isospin asymmetry , @xmath44 , is three times bigger for iron than it is for nickel : @xmath45 a larger isospin asymmetry results in more repulsion , compare fig .  1 .",
    "thus we expect that the isospin dependent mean field alone would favor a lower balance energy for the @xmath0fe system than for the @xmath0ni system .",
    "the numbers of protons and neutrons in the colliding system also have an influence on the average nucleon - nucleon cross section , because the neutron - proton cross section is approximately a factor of 3 bigger than the proton - proton cross section in the energy regime of interest here .",
    "we can then calculate the average nucleon - nucleon cross section from the number of collisions between nucleons of equal and opposite isospin , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of neutron - proton collisions .",
    "we make the _ ansatz _ that the number of collisions of two types of nucleons is proportional to the number of nucleons of each species , taken to some power , @xmath48 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 are the numbers of neutrons in target and projectile , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 are the numbers of protons in target and projectile . in intermediate energy",
    "heavy ion collisions , we find numerically that @xmath48 has values roughly in the range between 2/3 and 1 .    inserting this _ ansatz _ into our equation for the average cross section yields the result displayed in figure 2 .",
    "the difference in the systems with different isospin is small ( only approximately 0.5% for @xmath48=1 ) , but is clearly visible .",
    "since the isospin - averaged cross section is slightly bigger for the @xmath0ni system , this results in a higher kinetic pressure , therefore more repulsion , and thus a lower balance energy .",
    "the isospin composition of the projectile and target also has an effect on the pauli exclusion principle for the final scattering states of the nucleons .",
    "if there are more neutrons than protons , then these neutrons necessarily occupy are larger fraction of the available phase space for the scattered nucleons , resulting in a smaller number of pauli - allowed @xmath54 collisions than @xmath55 ones .",
    "however , for the considerations of the isospin dependence of the average in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross section , the interplay between pauli - principle and isospin content of the nuclei has only a small effect . to convince ourselves of this",
    ", we note that the boltzmann collision integral contains the factor @xmath56 \\cdot [ 1 - f_b(\\vec r,\\vec p)]\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the isospin indices of the two nucleons that take part in the scattering event .",
    "the factor @xmath57 represents the correction of the free nucleon - nucleon cross section due to the pauli exclusion principle for the final scattering states .",
    "if we average over all possible two - body scattering events , we find for beam energies larger than the fermi energy : @xmath58 the leading correction term to this approximation enters as @xmath59 .",
    "thus the differential effect of the pauli - exclusion principle on the isospin dependence of the average in - medium cross section is only a small correction to the determination of @xmath60 .",
    "we preface this section by briefly outlining our procedure to determine the balance energies : we begin by calculating the proton freeze - out phase - space distribution at reduced impact parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 , beam energies @xmath63 and @xmath64  mev / a , using equations[equation : limeanfield ] and [ equation : sobmean ] , and various in - medium corrections @xmath36 , eq .  [ equation : corr ] this is followed by calculating the flow for each permutation , and then the balance energy for each @xmath65 , using a @xmath66 minimization procedure .    in fig .  3 , we show the experimental results of pak _",
    "@xcite as the shaded rectangles .",
    "the width of these rectangles represent the width of the impact parameter bins used for the integrations of the experimental data .",
    "the height of the rectangles represent the error bars in the balance energy ( standard deviation of the mean ) .",
    "the darker shaded rectangles represent the experimental results for the @xmath0fe + @xmath0fe system , and the lighter gray areas those for the @xmath0ni + @xmath0ni .",
    "the thick horizontal lines through the middle of each rectangle represent the quoted experimental values .",
    "this experimental information is the same in all three panels of fig .  3 ,",
    "each time compared to a different calculation .",
    "before we discuss the ingredients of each calculation , we should point out that the experimentally found balance energies in @xmath0fe + @xmath0fe system are always higher than those for the @xmath0ni + @xmath0ni system .",
    "this is what we would expect from our elementary considerations of the effects of the coulomb interaction and the two - body collisions , but contrary to what we expect from the mean field alone .",
    "we will return to this point later .",
    "the theoretical results for the @xmath0fe + @xmath0fe system are indicated by the open plot symbols , and those for @xmath0ni + @xmath0ni by the filled ones .    in the left panel of fig .  3",
    ", we show the result of a calculation with the mean field interaction of b.a .",
    "li @xcite , and with @xmath67 .",
    "_ @xcite found that buu under - predicted the balance energies of @xmath0fe + @xmath0fe and @xmath0ni + @xmath0ni collisions .",
    "this is consistent with previous work @xcite that has shown the buu model utilizing free - space scattering cross sections consistently under - predicting the balance energies of various systems .",
    "however , the positive results of pak _ et al .",
    "_ was the correct reproduction of the differential effect in the balance energies  the difference between the balance energies for the two systems has the right sign and approximately the right magnitude .",
    "this can be verified by examining the left panel of fig .",
    "3 .    in the central and right panels , we use the isospin dependent mean fields of li ( center , @xcite , eq .",
    "[ equation : limeanfield ] ) and of sobotka ( right , @xcite , eq .  [ equation : sobmean ] ) , combined with the in - medium corrections to the elementary two - nucleon scattering cross sections . for the central panel ,",
    "we use @xmath68 , and for the right panel , we use @xmath69 , respectively .    let us first compare the results of the central and the left panel . for both calculations , we use identical isospin - dependent mean fields .",
    "the only difference is the change in the scattering in - medium correction .",
    "we can make two rather obvious observations :    1 .",
    "the theoretical calculations are much closer to the data when using the in - medium reduction of the scattering cross section  for all impact parameter intervals .",
    "this observation is consistent with previous results that did not look at isospin - dependent effects @xcite .",
    "even though the balance energies for the iron system are still slightly higher than for the nickel system , the magnitude of the splitting has been reduced and is now at least a factor of 4 smaller than what is observed in experiment .",
    "the same effects can be observed when using a different iso - spin dependent mean field , compare the right panel of fig .",
    "3 . here , the differences between the theoretical balance energies are somewhat larger , but still a factor of at least 2 smaller than those found in the data .",
    "we mentioned above that the observed sign of the difference in balance energies as a function of isospin is opposite to what one would expect from the behavior of the isospin - dependence of the mean field .",
    "this assertion can be verified in our numerical calculations by switching the isospin - dependent term in the mean field on and off .",
    "this comparison has been performed in fig .",
    "we use the same results as in the right panel of fig .  3 ( sobotka mean field , @xmath68 , represented by the diamonds in fig .  4 ) and compare them to a mean field without isospin dependence , but with the same value of the nuclear compressibility ( circles ) .",
    "in particular for the larger impact parameters , we can clearly see the expected effect : the isospin - dependent part of the mean field actually _ reduces _ the difference in the balance energies for the two systems .",
    "this is consistent with the results of our elementary considerations .",
    "the three - times larger isospin asymmetry in the iron system results in a stronger repulsion due to the isospin dependent mean field and is thus pushing the balance energy in the iron system more down than in the nickel system .",
    "we see an improvement in the performance of the buu model s prediction of balance energies as a function of impact parameter for collisions of @xmath0fe + @xmath0fe and @xmath0ni + @xmath0ni by including both an asymmetry energy term in the mean field and in - medium reduction of the nucleon cross section . we observe similar performance among the different formulations used for the mean field : one formulation recently used by bao - an li @xcite and one due to sobotka @xcite .",
    "however , the mean field of bao - an li , equation[equation : limeanfield ] , requires @xmath68 in equation[equation : corr ] , whereas the sobotka formulation , equation[equation : sobmean ] , requires @xmath69 for substantial improvement .",
    "efforts to distinguish between these two mean fields will likely come from heavy ion calculations in conjunction with experiments near the drip lines . in the systems studied in the experiments by pak _",
    "et al _ , the range in isospin asymmetry was not sufficiently large to constrain our parameter space any further .",
    "we have shown the different contributions of the coulomb force , the nn - scattering , and the isospin - dependent mean field on the isospin dependence of the balance energy .",
    "both our elementary considerations and our numerical results support the conclusion that the sign and the bulk of the isospin - difference in the balance energies is caused by the difference in the coulomb interaction and the isospin dependence in the effective nucleon - nucleon two - body scattering .",
    "while we can understand the absolute magnitude of the balance energies and the sign of the isospin - dependent difference between the two systems , our theoretical calculations do not yield the correct absolute magnitude of the difference .",
    "one can speculate on the origin of this important disagreement .",
    "a lack in our understanding of the isospin dependence of the nuclear mean field or the isospin - dependent in - medium modification of the two - body scattering cross section are the leading candidates .",
    "however , there is strong reason to suggest that the higher beam intensities of the radioactive beam facilities currently in planning or under construction will allow us to make progress in our understanding of this problem by enabling us to explore a larger isospin asymmetry in heavy ion reactions .",
