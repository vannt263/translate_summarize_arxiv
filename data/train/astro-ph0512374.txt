    "we are living in the golden age of cosmology . various data sets from precision measurements of temperature and polarization anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation as well as those of matter density fluctuations in the large - scale structure of the universe mapped by galaxy redshift surveys , lyman-@xmath11 forests and weak gravitational lensing observations are in a spectacular agreement with the concordance @xmath12cdm model @xcite .",
    "these results assure that theory of cosmological linear perturbations is basically correct , and can accurately describe the evolution of photons , neutrinos , baryons , and collisionless dark matter particles @xcite , for given initial perturbations generated during inflation @xcite . the predictions from linear perturbation theory can be compared with the precision cosmological measurements , in order to derive stringent constraints on the various basic cosmological parameters .",
    "future observations with better sensitivity and higher precision will continue to further improve our understanding of the universe .",
    "fluctuations in different cosmic fluids ( dark matter , photons , baryons , and neutrinos ) imprint characteristic features in their power spectra , owing to their interaction properties , thermal history , equation of state , and speed of sound .",
    "a remarkable example is the acoustic oscillation in the photon - baryon fluid that was generated before the decoupling epoch of photons , @xmath13 , which has been observed in the power spectrum of cmb temperature anisotropy @xcite , temperature  polarization cross correlation @xcite , and distribution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "yet , the latest observations have shown convincingly that we still do not understand much of the universe .",
    "the standard model of cosmology tells us that the universe has been dominated by four components . in chronological order",
    "the four components are : early dark energy ( also known as `` inflaton '' fields ) , radiation , dark matter , and late - time dark energy .",
    "the striking fact is that we do not understand the precise nature of three ( dark matter , and early and late - time dark energy ) out of the four components ; thus , understanding the nature of these three dark components has been and will continue to be one of the most important topics in cosmology in next decades . of which , one might be hopeful that the next generation particle accelerators such as the large hadron collider ( coming on - line in 2007 ) would find some hints for the nature of dark matter particles . on the other hand , the nature of late - time dark energy , which was discovered by measurements of luminosity distance out to distant type ia supernovae @xcite , is a complete mystery , and many people have been trying to find a way to constrain properties of dark energy ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "how about the early dark energy , inflaton fields , which caused the expansion of the universe to accelerate in the very early universe ?",
    "we know little about the nature of inflaton , just like we know little about the nature of late - time dark energy .",
    "the required property of inflaton fields is basically the same as that of the late - time dark energy component : both must have a large negative pressure which is less than @xmath14 of their energy density . to proceed further",
    ", however , one needs more information from observations .",
    "different inflation models make specific predictions for the shape of the power spectrum @xcite ( see also appendix  b ) as well as for other statistical properties @xcite of primordial perturbations .",
    "therefore , one of the most promising ways to constrain the physics of inflation , hence the nature of early dark energy in the universe , is to determine the shape of the primordial power spectrum accurately from observations .",
    "for example , the cmb data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe @xcite , combined with the large - scale structure data from the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite , have already ruled out one of the popular inflationary models driven by a self - interacting massless scalar field @xcite .",
    "understanding the physics of inflation better will likely provide an important implication for late - time dark energy .",
    "`` radiation '' in the universe at around the matter - radiation equality mainly consists of photons and neutrinos ; however , neutrinos actually stop being radiation when their mean energy per particle roughly equals the temperature of the universe .",
    "the physics of neutrinos has been revolutionized over the last decade by solar , atmospheric , reactor , and accelerator neutrino experiments having provided strong evidence for finite neutrino masses via mixing between different neutrino flavors , the so - called neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "these experiments are , however , only sensitive to mass square differences between neutrino mass eigenstates , implying @xmath15  ev@xmath16 and @xmath17  ev@xmath16 ; thus , the most fundamental quantity of neutrinos , the absolute mass , has not been determined yet .",
    "cosmological neutrinos that are the relic of the cosmic thermal history have distinct influences on the structure formation . their large energy density , comparable to the energy density of photons before the matter - radiation equality , determines the expansion history of the universe .",
    "even after the matter - radiation equality , neutrinos having become non - relativistic affect the structure formation by suppressing the growth of matter density fluctuations at small spatial scales owing to their large velocity dispersion @xcite ( see sec .",
    "ii and appendix  a for more details ) .",
    "therefore , the galaxy redshift surveys , combined with the cmb data , provide a powerful , albeit indirect , means to constraining the neutrino properties @xcite .",
    "this approach also complements the theoretical and direct experimental efforts for understanding the neutrino physics .",
    "in fact , the cosmological constraints have placed the most stringent upper bound on the total neutrino mass , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) @xcite , stronger than the direct experiment limit @xmath20 @xcite . in addition , the result obtained from the liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd ) experiment , which implies @xmath21 to @xmath22 oscillations with @xmath23ev@xmath16 @xcite in an apparent contradiction with the other neutrino oscillation experiments mentioned above , potentially suggests the need for new physics : the cosmological observations will provide independent tests of this hypothesis .    in this paper",
    "we shall study the capability of future galaxy surveys at high redshifts , combined with the cmb data , for constraining ( 1 ) the neutrino properties , more specifically the total neutrino mass , @xmath24 , and the number of non - relativistic neutrino species , @xmath25 , and ( 2 ) the shape of the primordial power spectrum that is parameterized in terms of the spectral tilt , @xmath26 , and the running index , @xmath9 , motivated by inflationary predictions ( see appendix  b ) . for the former , we shall pay particular attention to our ability to simultaneously constrain @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as they will provide important clues to resolving the absolute mass scale as well as the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "the accuracy of determining the neutrino parameters and the power spectrum shape parameters will be derived using the fisher information matrix formalism , including marginalization over the other cosmological parameters as well as the galaxy bias .",
    "our analysis differs from the previous work on the neutrino parameters in that we fully take into account the two - dimensional nature of the galaxy power spectrum in the line - of - sight and transverse directions , while the previous work used only spherically averaged , one - dimensional power spectra . the geometrical distortion due to cosmology and the redshift space distortion due to the peculiar velocity field will cause anisotropic features in the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "these features help to lift degeneracies between cosmological parameters , substantially reducing the uncertainties in the parameter determinations .",
    "this is especially true when variations in parameters of interest cause modifications in the power spectrum shape , which is indeed the case for the neutrino parameters , tilt and running index .",
    "the usefulness of the two - dimensional power spectrum , especially for high - redshift galaxy surveys , has been carefully investigated in the context of the prospected constraints on late - time dark energy properties @xcite .",
    "we shall show the parameter forecasts for future wide - field galaxy surveys that are already being planned or seriously under consideration : the fiber multiple object spectrograph ( fmos ) on subaru telescope @xcite , its significantly expanded version , wfmos @xcite , the hobby ",
    "ebery telescope dark energy experiment ( hetdex ) @xcite , and the cosmic inflation probe ( cip ) mission @xcite . to model these surveys , we consider three hypothetical galaxy surveys which probe the universe over different ranges of redshift , ( 1 ) @xmath27 , ( 2 ) @xmath28 and ( 3 ) @xmath29 .",
    "we fix the sky coverage of each survey at @xmath30  deg@xmath16 in order to make a fair comparison between different survey designs .",
    "as we shall show below , high - redshift surveys are extremely powerful for precision cosmology because they allow us to probe the linear power spectrum down to smaller length scales than surveys at low redshifts , protecting the cosmological information against systematics due to non - linear perturbations .",
    "we shall also study how the parameter uncertainties are affected by changes in the number density of sampled galaxies and the survey volume .",
    "the results would give us a good guidance to defining the optimal survey design to achieve the desired accuracies in parameter determinations .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "[ formalism ] we describe a methodology to model the galaxy power spectrum observable from a redshift survey that includes the two - dimensional nature in the line - of - sight and transverse directions .",
    "we then present the fisher information matrix formalism that is used to estimate the projected uncertainties in the cosmological parameter determination from statistical errors on the galaxy power spectrum measurement for a given survey . after survey parameters are defined in sec .",
    "[ survey ] , we show the parameter forecasts in sec .  [ results ] .",
    "finally , we present conclusions and some discussions in sec .",
    "we review the basic properties of cosmological neutrinos in appendix  a , the basic predictions from inflationary models for the shape of the primordial power spectrum in appendix  b , and the relation between the primordial power spectrum and the observed power spectrum of matter density fluctuations in appendix  c.    in the following , we assume an adiabatic , cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated cosmological model with flat geometry , which is supported by the wmap results @xcite , and employ the the notation used in @xcite : the present - day density of cdm , baryons , and non - relativistic neutrinos , in units of the critical density , are denoted as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the total matter density is then @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the ratio of the massive neutrino density contribution to @xmath36 : @xmath37 .",
    "throughout this paper we assume the standard thermal history in the early universe : there are three neutrino species with temperature equal to @xmath38 of the photon temperature .",
    "we then assume that @xmath39 species are massive and could become non - relativistic by the present epoch , and those non - relativistic neutrinos have equal masses , @xmath40 .",
    "as we show in appendix  [ app : neutrino ] , the density parameter of the non - relativistic neutrinos is given by @xmath41 , where we have assumed 2.725k for the cmb temperature today @xcite , and @xmath42 is the hubble parameter defined as @xmath43kms@xmath44mpc@xmath44 .",
    "the neutrino mass fraction is thus given by @xmath45 structure formation is modified by non - relativistic neutrinos on scales below the hubble horizon size when the neutrinos became non - relativistic , @xmath46mpc@xmath44 ( see eq .  [ [ eq : knr ] ] ) . in particular , the characteristic scale imprinted onto the galaxy power spectrum at a given redshift @xmath0 is the neutrino free - streaming scale , which is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : kfs ] ) : @xmath47 therefore , non - relativistic neutrinos with lighter masses suppress the growth of structure formation on larger spatial scales at a given redshift , and the free - streaming length becomes shorter at a lower redshift as neutrino velocity decreases with redshift .",
    "the most important property of the free - streaming scale is that it depends on the mass of each species , @xmath40 , rather than the total mass , @xmath48 ; thus , measurements of @xmath49 allow us to distinguish different neutrino mass hierarchy models .",
    "fortunately , @xmath49 appears on the scales that are accessible by galaxy surveys : @xmath50 at @xmath51 for @xmath52 .    on the spatial scales larger than the free - streaming length , @xmath53 , neutrinos can cluster and fall into gravitational potential well together with cdm and baryonic matter . in this case , perturbations in all matter components ( cdm , baryon and neutrinos , denoted as ` cb@xmath54 ' hereafter ) grow at the same rate given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the usual linear growth factor ( see , e.g. , eq .  ( 4 ) in @xcite ) . on the other hand , on the scales smaller than the free - streaming length , @xmath57 , perturbations in non - relativistic neutrinos",
    "are absent due to the large velocity dispersion . in this case , the gravitational potential well is supported only by cdm and baryonic matter , and the growth of matter perturbations is slowed down relative to that on the larger scales . as a result , the matter power spectrum for @xmath58 is suppressed relative to that for @xmath59 . in this limit",
    "the total matter perturbations grow at the slower rate given by @xmath60^{1-p}\\qquad k\\gg k_{\\rm fs}(z ) , \\label{eqn : d_cbnu}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "an accurate fitting function for the scale - dependent growth rate was derived by matching these two asymptotic solutions .",
    "we shall use the fitting function throughout this paper .",
    "= 8.5 cm    figure [ fig : growth ] shows suppression in the growth rate of total matter perturbations at @xmath62 , 0.1 , and 1  @xmath42mpc@xmath44 due to the neutrino free - streaming .",
    "the suppression becomes more significant at lower redshifts for a given wavenumber , or for higher frequency perturbations at a given redshift , because neutrino can grow together with cdm and baryonic matter after the spatial scale of a given perturbation has become larger than the neutrino free - streaming scale that varies with redshift as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : kfs * ] ) .",
    "it is thus expected that a galaxy survey with different redshift slices can be used to efficiently extract the neutrino parameters , @xmath63 and @xmath40 .",
    "the upper and middle panels of figure [ fig : pk ] illustrate how free - streaming of non - relativistic neutrinos suppresses the amplitude of linear matter power spectrum , @xmath64 , at @xmath65 .",
    "note that we have normalized the primordial power spectrum such that all the power spectra match at @xmath66 ( see   [ pps ] ) . to illuminate the dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath40",
    ", we fix the total mass of non - relativistic neutrinos , @xmath48 , by @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the upper and middle panels , respectively , and vary the number of non - relativistic neutrino species as @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . the suppression of power is clearly seen as one goes from @xmath72 to @xmath73 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : kfs * ] ] for the value of @xmath49 ) .",
    "the way the power is suppressed may be easily understood by the dependence of @xmath74 on @xmath40 ; for example , @xmath64 at smaller @xmath75 is more suppressed for a smaller @xmath40 , as lighter neutrinos have longer free - streaming lengths .",
    "on very small scales , @xmath76 ( @xmath77 and 0.1mpc@xmath44 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively ) , however , the amount of suppression becomes nearly independent of @xmath75 , and depends only on @xmath35 ( or the total neutrino mass , @xmath78 ) as @xmath79 \\approx 8f_\\nu .",

    "[ survey ] .",
    "we find that @xmath64 will be measured with @xmath81 accuracy in each @xmath75 bin .",
    "if other cosmological parameters were perfectly known , the total mass of non - relativistic neutrinos as small as @xmath82 would be detected at more than 2-@xmath80 .",
    "this limit is much smaller than the lower mass limit implied from the neutrino oscillation experiments , 0.06ev .",
    "this estimate is , of course , unrealistic because a combination of other cosmological parameters could mimic the @xmath63 or @xmath35 dependence of @xmath64 .",
    "the lower panel in figure  [ fig : pk ] illustrates how other cosmological parameters change the shape of @xmath64 . in the following",
    ", we shall extensively study how well future high - redshift galaxy surveys , combined with the cosmic microwave background data , can determine the mass of non - relativistic neutrinos and discriminate between different @xmath25 , fully taking into account degeneracies between cosmological parameters .",
    "inflation generally predicts that the primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbations is nearly scale - invariant .",
    "different inflationary models make specific predictions for _ deviations _ of the primordial spectrum from a scale - invariant spectrum , and the deviation is often parameterized by the `` tilt '' , @xmath26 , and the `` running index '' , @xmath9 , of the primordial power spectrum . as the primordial power spectrum is nearly scale - invariant , @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    "are predicted to be much less than unity .",
    "this , however , does not mean that the observed matter power spectrum is also nearly scale - invariant .",

    "this example shows that precision determination of @xmath26 and @xmath9 allows us to discriminate between candidate inflationary models ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "suppose now that we have a redshift survey of galaxies at some redshift .",
    "galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying gravitational field , and the galaxy power spectrum measures how clustering strength of galaxies varies as a function of 3-dimensional wavenumbers , @xmath75 ( or the inverse of 3-dimensional length scales ) .",
    "we do not measure the length scale directly in real space ; rather , we measure ( 1 ) angular positions of galaxies on the sky , and ( 2 ) radial positions of galaxies in redshift space . to convert ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to positions in 3-dimensional space",
    ", however , one needs to assume a reference cosmological model , which might be different from the true cosmology .",
    "an incorrect mapping of observed angular and redshift positions to 3-dimensional positions produces a distortion in the measured power spectrum , known as the `` geometrical distortion '' @xcite .",
    "the geometrical distortion can be described as follows .",

    "a tricky part is that @xmath111 and @xmath115 in eq .",

    "therefore , it is desirable to combine the galaxy survey constraints with the constraints from cmb temperature and polarization anisotropy , in order to lift parameter degeneracies .",
    "when computing the fisher matrix of cmb , we employ 7 parameters : 6 parameters ( the parameters above minus the neutrino parameters and the bias parameters ) plus the thomson scattering optical depth to the last scattering surface , @xmath176 .",
    "note that we ignore the effects of non - relativistic neutrinos on the cmb power spectra : their effects are small and do not add very much to the constraints from the high-@xmath0 galaxy survey .",
    "we then add the cmb fisher matrix to the galaxy fisher matrix as @xmath177 .",
    "we entirely ignore the contribution to the cmb from the primordial gravitational waves .",
    "we use the publicly - available cmbfast code @xcite to compute the angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropy , @xmath178 , @xmath179-mode polarization , @xmath180 , and their cross correlation , @xmath181 .",
    "specifically we consider the noise per pixel and the angular resolution of the planck experiment that were assumed in @xcite .",
    "note that we use the cmb information in the range of multipole @xmath182 .",

    "<S> high-@xmath0 galaxy redshift surveys open up exciting possibilities for precision determinations of neutrino masses and inflationary models . </S>",
    "<S> the high-@xmath0 surveys are more useful for cosmology than low-@xmath0 ones owing to much weaker non - linearities in matter clustering , redshift - space distortion and galaxy bias , which allows us to use the galaxy power spectrum down to the smaller spatial scales that are inaccessible by low-@xmath0 surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we can then utilize the two - dimensional information of the linear power spectrum in angular and redshift space to measure the scale - dependent suppression of matter clustering due to neutrino free - streaming as well as the shape of the primordial power spectrum . to illustrate capabilities of high-@xmath0 surveys for constraining neutrino masses and the primordial power spectrum , we compare three future redshift surveys covering 300  square degrees at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , combined with the cosmic microwave background data expected from the planck satellite , these surveys allow precision determination of the total neutrino mass with the projected errors of @xmath4 , 0.043 , and 0.025  ev , respectively , thus yielding a positive _ detection _ of the neutrino mass rather than an upper limit , as @xmath5 is smaller than the lower limits to the neutrino masses implied from the neutrino oscillation experiments , by up to a factor of 4 for the highest redshift survey . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracies of constraining the tilt and running index of the primordial power spectrum , @xmath6 and @xmath7 at @xmath8 , respectively , are smaller than the current uncertainties by more than an order of magnitude , which will allow us to discriminate between candidate inflationary models . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the error on @xmath9 from the future highest redshift survey is not very far away from the prediction of a class of simple inflationary models driven by a massive scalar field with self - coupling , @xmath10 . </S>"
