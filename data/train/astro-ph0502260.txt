    "thermal emission arises from stellar sources , hii regions , and the dense clouds of dust and gas pervading the inner two degrees of the galactic center ( see morris and serabyn and references therein 1996 ) .",
    "one of the questions that naturally arises from these observations is whether the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of infrared radiation by relativistic particles is an important contribution to the nonthermal x - ray emission from this region of the galaxy .",
    "here we investigate this possibility on a local scale and examine the application of ics in three nonthermal filaments that are detected in both radio and x - ray wavelengths .",

    "the lack of x - ray emission from the southern peak of sgra - f in figure 2 is in part due to the low - sensitivity region experienced in the chip gaps of the acis observations .",
    "most of the x - ray sources have a shape similar to that expected from the chandra point spread function ( psf ) , whereas sgra - f is clearly more extended than the psf .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that it is a chance association with an extended radio source .",

    "the uncertainty on the spectral index of sgra - f is large , but the range of values is consistent with that seen from sgra - e .",

    "@xmath36 is based on 2 and 6 cm images for sgra - e whereas @xmath37 is measured between 6 and 3.6 cm for sgra - f . the spectral index distribution between 6 and 2 cm was constructed by using an identical _ uv _ range between 0.4 and 40 k@xmath7 .",
    "the flat spectrum of sgr a - e suggests an interaction with a molecular cloud .",
    "indeed , an interaction between the 20 molecular cloud and sgra - e and f has been suggested earlier in an nh@xmath38 line study of this region ( coil and ho 2000 ) . to examine the interaction hypothesis , high - resolution cs ( 21 ) observations of this region",

    "the cs ( 21 ) emission appears clumpy on a scale of few arcseconds and its distribution is concentrated in the vicinity of sgra - e and f. the most striking result is the recognition of a molecular filament which appears to be the counterpart to the northern extension of the banana - shaped structure of sgra - e near@xmath40 .",
    "a slice cut perpendicular to the long axis of the molecular feature enveloping sgra - e , as displayed in figure 6a , shows that the velocities range between 10 and 40 .",
    "this position - velocity diagram indicates a velocity shift of about 5 across the width of this molecular filament with an extent of about 15@xmath8 .",

    "a velocity line profile of the peak position , as shown in figure 6b , indicates a total linewidth of about 40 from a size of about 3@xmath43 .",
    "additional support for the proximity of the 20 gmc ( g359.98 - 0.07 or m-0.13 - 0.08 ) to sgra - e and f comes from the distribution of dust emission .",

    "a recent 20 cm radio continuum image of g359.54 + 0.18 shows that the length of this filament extends for about 15@xmath11 .",

    "the detection of x - ray emission from the brightest portion of the ripple filament g359.54 + 0.18 was first reported by lu , wang and lang ( 2003 ) as part of the galactic center survey carried out by chandra .",

    "we calibrated this observation with the standard pipeline processing and analyzed with ciao 2.2.1 .",
    "a background spectrum was extracted with the same region as the source spectrum from a customized `` blank - sky '' file .",
    "x - ray emission is seen from the region where the radio filament breaks up into two subfilaments .",

    "x - ray emission from g359.54 + 0.18 is superimposed on a grayscale smooth chandra image in the top panel ; contours of x - ray emission superimposed on a grayscale 6 cm image of the northern and southern subfilaments are shown in the bottom panel .",
    "a weak x - ray filament with an extent of 1@xmath11 is noted exactly along the northern subfilament .",

    "sakano et al ( 2003 ) suggest that the x - ray emission from xmm j1745402904 is due to synchrotron radiation emitted from tev electrons . in particular , they find that the x - ray spectrum from sgra - e is consistent with steepening by 0.5 in slope between radio and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "our improved spectral index determinations at radio and x - ray energies differs from earlier x - ray and radio spectral measurements ( sakano et al . 2003 ; ho et al . 1985 ) .",

    ". however , their best - fit power law with their uncertainties are consistent with the new fitted values , @xmath20 .",
    "since our new chandra observations is about 20 times more sensitive than previous observations , uncertainties of the spectral fit are smaller and should be more reliable . on the radio side , we presented new high resolution radio continuum data and measured flux densities from the region with an x - ray counterpart at a number of wavelengths between 2 and 20 cm .",

    "such a change in the spectral index value is consistent with the synchrotron picture suggested by sakano et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in this picture , the elongated nature of sgra - e which extends for more than 2@xmath11 compared to 30@xmath8 extent of the x - ray filament suggests that synchrotron cooling losses are responsible for the origin of the different morphology between radio and x - rays ( see figure 3 ) . assuming a magnetic field of 100@xmath59 g and electron energies @xmath2tev",
    ", x - ray emission has a lifetime of @xmath60 years which is much shorter than the lifetime of gev electrons producing radio emission ( e.g. , beck and krause 2005 ) . during this time",
    ", the diffusion of x - ray emitting particles with a velocity of 300 can explain the 30@xmath8 length of the filament which corresponds to about @xmath581 pc at the 8kpc distance of the galactic center .    what could be the origin of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies ?",
    "the flat spectrum of the region traced by sgra - e at radio frequencies provides an insight as what the cause might be .",
    "this flat spectrum is reminiscent of the w28 snr which is known to be interacting with an adjacent molecular cloud ( dubner et al .",
    "the flat spectral index distribution is consistent with the fermi acceleration mechanism predicting a flatter spectrum when a shock wave drives through a molecular cloud ( bykov et al .",
    "this picture is supported by the distribution and kinematics of the cs ( 2 - 1 ) molecular gas associated with the 20 cloud in the vicinity of sgra - e .",
    "also , we note a number of stellar x - ray sources detected in the region near sgra - e ( muno et al . 2003 ) . based on the low exposure x - ray image of g359.88 - 0.08 , lu , wang and lang ( 2003 ) have suggested that a compact x - ray source cxou j174539.6 - 290413 is located to the northern tip of xmm j1745402904.5 and that it may coincide with a pulsar responsible for producing x - ray and radio emission from sgra - e .",
    "however , the deeper observations presented here ( see figure 3a ) do not confirm the presence of a point - like x - ray source at the tip of the structure .      unlike the sgra - e filament , which has flat and steep spectra in radio and x - rays , respectively , the sgra - f filament has a steep spectrum at both radio ( @xmath61 ) and x - ray wavelengths ( @xmath62 ) . in principle the radio and x - ray spectra could be segments of a single synchrotron spectrum with @xmath63 between radio and x - rays .",
    "however , as the radio spectrum of sgr a - f is much steeper than that of sgr a - e , and given that the 20 molecular cloud , with its intense 1.2 mm dust emission , lies in the vicinity of sgra - f , it is possible that the x - rays could be produced by inverse compton scattering of far - infrared photons from dust by the relativistic electrons responsible for the radio synchrotron emission .    to estimate the ic emission we adopt a greybody fir spectrum from warm dust at temperature @xmath64 of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the planck function and",
    "@xmath67 is the dust optical depth .",

    "a recent iso survey of the galactic center molecular clouds suggest the presence of warm and a cold dust ( rodriguez - fernandez et al .",
    "most of the clouds show dust temperatures less than 40k .",
    "this suggests that the relatively large x - ray flux from sgr a - f would require a low magnetic field of 0.03 - 0.13 mg .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field depends on the synchrotron flux , the low - energy cutoff of the relativistic electron energy spectrum and the depth of the source . assuming the depth is equivalent to 10@xmath8",
    ", the equipartition field is 0.20 mg for a cutoff of 10 mev or 0.14 mg for a cutoff of 100 mev .",
    "note that this assumes that no relativistic protons are present .",
    "if the depth is 100@xmath8 which is higher than the transverse dimension of the filament , the equipartition fields are 0.11 mg and 0.07 mg for cutoffs of 10 and 100 mev respectively .    to summarize , the x - ray flux can be matched by inverse compton emission for a dust temperature of 50k and field strength 0.08 mg .",
    "this field might be in energy equipartition with the electrons provided that the depth of the source is equivalent to 100@xmath8 ( 4pc at the distance of 8kpc ) and there are no relativistic protons present . however , almost all the galactic center radio filaments have transverse dimensions which are typically @xmath92 including the width of sgra - f .",
    "thus , the estimated magnetic field is sub - equipartition .",
    "the kinematical and morphological arguments for the interaction of the ripple filament g359.54 + 0.18 with molecular gas and hii region have been given by staguhn et al .",
    "the break in the radio spectral index of the ripple from @xmath93 to @xmath94 implies that synchrotron emission from a single population of relativistic electrons can not be responsible since the required radio to x - ray index is @xmath95 . using the break frequency of 5 ghz corresponding to 6 cm and a magnetic field of 0.07 mg ,",
    "the synchrotron lifetime of the ripple filament is 8@xmath96 years .",
    "inverse compton scattering of the fir radiation emitted by the dust grains in the molecular clouds associated with the ripple filament does not appear to be significant : the flux predicted in this model is only comparable to the unabsorbed 0.510 kev flux , @xmath97 , and even then only with the marginal assumptions that the magnetic field is 0.07 mg and dust temperature is 50k .",
    "this dust temperature is similar to the hot component of dust temperature measured with iso ( rodriguez - fernandez et al .",
    "in addition , the x - ray emission arises only from the northern subfilament ( see figure 8) raising the question of why in an ics the southern subfilament with the same radio brightness temperature and similar fir radiation field does not have an x - ray counterpart ?",
    "one explanation is variations of the magnetic field and particle density between the northern and southern subfilaments .",
    "a more detailed sensitive measurements should be important in testing this hypothesis .",
    "we also examined the possibility that the x - ray emission may arise from synchrotron self - compton scattering ( ssc ) .",
    "however , the synchrotron emission from the filaments in radio wavelengths is too weak to be important in the ssc model for the following reasons : the ratio of ssc emission to inverse compton scattering of a diluted black body intensity w@xmath98 is 2.5@xmath99 assuming that the temperature of a molecular cloud is 10k .",
    "the brightness temperature of g359.54 + 0.18 at 6 cm is 50k and the synchrotron radiation spectrum depends on @xmath100 .",
    "physically , the reason is that the synchrotron spectrum decreases at higher frequencies , whereas the black body spectrum increases strongly .",
    "we have provided detailed x - ray and radio studies of three radio filaments near the galactic center that have x - ray counterparts .",
    "this study suggests that two radio filaments with steep spectrum in radio wavelengths are likely to be produced by inverse compton scattering of fir radiation emitted from molecular clouds in the vicinity of the filaments .",
    "the inferred magnetic field strength from these measurements indicate a field strength less than mg associated with the filaments . however , the largest uncertainty in these estimates is the determination of dust temperature of the clouds .",

    "<S> recent chandra and xmm-_newton _ observations reported evidence of two x - ray filaments g359.88 - 0.08 ( sgra - e ) and g359.54 + 0.18 ( the ripple filament ) near the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray emission from these filaments has a nonthermal spectrum and coincides with synchrotron emitting radio sources . here , </S>",
    "<S> we report the detection of a new x - ray feature coincident with a radio filament g359.90 - 0.06 ( sgra - f ) and show more detailed vla , chandra and bima observations of the radio and x - ray filaments . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that radio emission from the nonthermal filaments g359.90 - 0.06 ( sgra - f ) and g359.54 + 0.18 ( the ripple ) has a steep spectrum whereas g359.88 - 0.08 ( sgra - e ) has a flat spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray emission from both these sources could be due to synchrotron radiation </S>",
    "<S> . however , given that the 20 molecular cloud , with its intense 1.2 mm dust emission , lies in the vicinity of sgra - f , it is possible that the x - rays could be produced by inverse compton scattering of far - infrared photons from dust by the relativistic electrons responsible for the radio synchrotron emission . </S>",
    "<S> the production of x - ray emission from ics allows an estimate of the magnetic field strength of  0.08 mg within the nonthermal filament . </S>",
    "<S> this should be an important parameter for any models of the galactic center nonthermal filaments .    </S>",
