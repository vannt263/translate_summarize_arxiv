    "in the last two decades , significant progress has been made towards the detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) via laser interferometry .",
    "currently , the ground - based experiments ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo @xcite , and tama @xcite are actively searching for gws @xcite .",
    "moreover , the proposed lisa experiment @xcite , due to be the first space - based gw detector , will search for gws in a complementary frequency band to the ground - based experiments and is expected to achieve high event rates at an unprecedented signal - to - noise ratio @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting source of gws , which is expected to be detected , is the compact binary system undergoing coalescence , with neutron star ( ns ) and/or black hole ( bh ) constituents .",
    "current experiments have yet to detect the binary inspiral signal",
    ". however , advanced ligo @xcite , an upgrade of ligo scheduled to come online in 2014 , may allow for routine detection of such events .",
    "this is due to a @xmath0-fold increase in sensitivity over ligo , which will in turn result in an increase of the accessible event rate by a factor @xmath1 .",
    "current estimates for the number of expected ns / ns , bh / bh , and bh / ns events in advanced ligo are roughly @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 per year , respectively @xcite .",
    "all three stages of the binary coalescence , inspiral , merger , and ringdown , are potentially detectable .",
    "the inspiral phase , where the characteristic orbital velocity is @xmath5 ( in units where @xmath6 ) , can be computed analytically using an expansion in @xmath7 .",
    "the merger is computed numerically @xcite , and there has been significant recent progress in this area @xcite . the ringdown can be treated analytically using quasinormal modes @xcite .",
    "the perturbative calculation of the inspiral phase has been performed with a variety of methods @xcite .",
    "because of the phase evolution of the inspiral signal and the ability to measure the total orbital phase to @xmath8 over the ligo bandwidth @xcite , these perturbation expansions must be calculated to high order .",
    "if we consider a circular orbit in the adiabatic approximation , the signal phase @xmath9 is related to the orbital energy @xmath10 and the radiated power @xmath11 through the relation @xmath12 .",
    "an accuracy of @xmath8 in the cumulative orbital phase , over the ligo bandwidth , can be achieved if the perturbation expansion is calculated to @xmath13 beyond newtonian dynamics i.e. , at third post - newtonian order ( 3pn ) @xcite .",
    "this implies that we need to know @xmath10 and @xmath11 to at least 3pn .",
    "since the conservative dynamics , described in our formalism by a lagrangian , gives @xmath10 , it also must be known to 3pn .",
    "there is also a need to compute the perturbative expansion to high order , to allow numerical studies of the binary inspiral to be compared with the analytic pn expansion @xcite .",
    "recently , goldberger and rothstein introduced an effective field theory ( eft ) for nonrelativistic gravitational systems , known as nrgr @xcite ( see @xcite for a pedagogical introduction ) .",
    "efts are particularly well suited to problems with multiple physical scales , and the binary inspiral which we consider here , is one such problem .",
    "the hierarchy during inspiral takes the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the radius of the compact objects , @xmath16 is the orbital separation , and @xmath17 is the wavelength of the emitted gws .",
    "one can use this hierarchy to set up a tower of efts which systematically account for effects at each scale .",
    "this approach disentangles the physical effects of different scales , resulting in more tractable calculations . with the definite power - counting scheme established by goldberger and rothstein @xcite ,",
    "the eft treatment yields a completely systematic description of the binary inspiral problem .",
    "in particular , divergences which arise by using point particle sources to represent the compact objects are well understood in a field theory setting , and the effects due to the spatial extent of the compact objects can be systematically parameterized by subleading operators .",
    "state - of - the - art calculations using traditional methods have yielded the conservative equations of motion and the orbital energy of a binary with spinless constituents to 3pn order @xcite .",
    "the 2pn dynamics of a three - body system have been obtained in @xcite , but the four - body dynamics at 2pn are not known in closed form , see , for example , appendix d of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the power emitted by a binary with spinless objects through gws is known at the 3.5pn level @xcite or @xmath18 beyond the leading quadrupole formula .",
    "while the eft approach lags behind the traditional post - newtonian methods in terms of high precision calculations of gw observables for binaries without spin , it has led to a number of interesting results .",
    "spin was incorporated into the eft framework and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) spin - spin potential , which enters at 3pn , has been calculated for the first time @xcite .",
    "dissipative effects such as absorption by bh horizons have also been considered @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the thermodynamics of compactified black holes were studied , and the einstein - infeld - hoffman ( eih ) lagrangian and the quadrupole formula were derived in arbitrary dimensions in @xcite .",
    "the eft formalism was extended to the case of extreme mass - ratio binaries where the leading order ( lo ) self - force equation was derived @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been used in calculations which include interactions beyond einstein s general relativity @xcite .    within the eft method , kol and smolkin ( ks ) suggested that a temporal kaluza - klein parametrization of the metric @xcite improved the calculational efficiency of nrgr .",
    "the ks parametrization has been shown to reduce the complexity required to calculate the eih lagrangian @xcite .",
    "similar simplifications were observed in the computation of thermodynamic properties of compactified black holes @xcite , and in the calculation of the nlo order spin - spin potential @xcite .    in this paper , we report the nrgr calculation of the 2pn interaction lagrangian for a binary system with nonspinning compact objects .",
    "existing eft calculations of binary observables have been obtained at nlo for potential interactions and at lo for the radiated power .",
    "this work presents the first next - to - next - to - leading order computation of a gw observable with the eft method . since the complexity of our calculation is more involved , we clearly want to find an optimum method to perform high precision calculations within nrgr . previously , it was not clear how useful the ks parametrization would be as a computational tool beyond nlo .",
    "we address this issue in detail , and we show how the ks parametrization simplifies our 2pn calculations .",
    "the methods of eft are used to systematically determine all relevant feynman diagrams which contribute at 2pn . in their evaluation",
    ", we encounter feynman integrals corresponding to one - loop and two - loop integrals , which are computed using standard techniques .",
    "our work demonstrates how the eft method to can be used to efficiently compute conservative dynamics at high precision in the pn expansion .",
    "here , we outline the ingredients of our calculation of the 2pn potential and discuss the simplifications we will employ . in this section , we do not repeat in entirety the setup of the eft description of the binary inspiral problem , but refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "since we deal with conservative dynamics , we only need potential modes , and can simply set the radiation modes to zero .",
    "the purely gravitational action is the usual einstein - hilbert action @xmath19 where our conventions are @xmath20 , @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , we must also fix the gauge .",
    "our choice is harmonic gauge @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "it differs from the linearized harmonic gauge condition used in @xcite and yields different expressions at the 2pn level .",
    "the advantage of using harmonic gauge is that we can compare intermediate gauge - dependent results , such as the equations of motion , with the existing literature @xcite .    for the gravitational coupling to two massive compact objects ,",
    "the worldline action for our binary system is given by @xmath26 here , proper time is given by @xmath27 and it is convenient to use coordinate time @xmath28 to parameterize the worldline .",
    "the dots denote subleading operators encoding finite size effects .",
    "we will ignore finitesize effects since they first enter at 5pn @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the metric around flat minkowski space in the weak field limit is commonly parameterized in a lorentz covariant form such as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the excitation around minkowski space .",
    "the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hmunumetric ] ) was used in the original setup by goldberger and rothstein @xcite .",
    "instead , we will use an alternative parametrization based on a temporal kaluza - klein decomposition , as suggested by ks @xcite . in terms of the ks variables ,",
    "the metric reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 . in four dimensions ,",
    "the metric excitations are now described in terms of a scalar field @xmath33 , a three - vector field @xmath34 , and a @xmath35 symmetric tensor field @xmath36 , all of which have been normalized to have mass dimension 1 . in the ground state ,",
    "@xmath37 , and the metric reduces to minkowski space - time . in terms of the ks variables , the eh action has the simple form @xmath38 - \\frac{1}{4 } e^{4 \\phi } f_{ij } f^{ij } + 2 ( \\partial^i \\phi)(\\partial_i \\phi ) + \\ldots   \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and the dots denote terms with time derivatives . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ehks ] ) all spatial indices are lowered or raised with @xmath40 or @xmath41 , respectively .",

    "( [ eqn : ksmetric ] ) , we can proceed to derive feynman rules for the gravitational self - couplings and the couplings to the compact object worldlines .",
    "the procedure is equivalent to the one in @xcite , but is now implemented in terms of the ks fields . for the gravitational self - couplings and worldline couplings ,",
    "there are infinitely many terms in the respective actions . to avoid unnecessary calculation at a given order , a method of systematic computation",
    "must be established .",
    "the power - counting rules for our calculation are the same as those in the original eft setup developed in @xcite . however , since there are no radiation fields in our 2pn potential calculation , we use a simplified procedure where we power count our feynman diagrams relative to the lo newtonian potential . for a bound state , the virial theorem relates the orbital velocity @xmath42 and newton s constant @xmath43 via , @xmath44 , and as shown in @xcite , one can power count all contributions in powers of the orbital velocity @xmath42 . keeping the virial theorem in mind , we count powers of @xmath43 and powers of @xmath45 separately . for the power",
    "counting we do not keep track of factors of mass @xmath46 and separation @xmath16 associated to each @xmath43 . these will be generated appropriately in the calculation of the diagrams . in this scheme , the diagram responsible for the newtonian potential scales as @xmath47 . for the 2pn potential calculation",
    ", we need to include all diagrams which scale as @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .    to determine the relevant feynman diagrams at 2pn , the first stage is to generate all relevant diagram topologies .",
    "to do this , one first counts in powers of @xmath43 , since all interaction vertices will scale with a power of @xmath43 ( recall @xmath51 ) .",
    "powers of velocity are inserted later , when all relevant diagram topologies have been established .",
    "there are two rules to consider when counting a topology in factors of @xmath43 .",
    "firstly , when there are @xmath52 gravitons attached to a worldline , this component receives a factor of @xmath53 .",
    "secondly , each @xmath52-graviton self - interaction vertex receives a factor of @xmath54 .",
    "note that a propagator does not receive any factors . using these rules any diagram topology can be counted in powers of @xmath43 .",
    "if we now proceed to apply these rules , we can only have a single topology at @xmath55 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g1topo ] .",
    "all topologies which simply renormalize the mass are omitted , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "diagrams which involve a graviton line starting and ending on the same worldline , without any intermediate interaction , fall into this category . at the next order , @xmath56",
    ", we have two topologies , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2topo ] . since the worldlines are static sources and do not propagate , the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2topo ] do not involve any loops .",
    "diagrams with gravitational loops yield quantum effects and are therefore ignored , and since only massless fields propagate in nrgr , the expansion in loops corresponds to an expansion in powers of @xmath57 @xcite . at @xmath58 ,",
    "the total number of possible topologies is nine , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g3topo ] .",
    "these diagrams are the relevant topologies for the static component of the 2pn potential . in figs .",
    "[ fig : g2topo ] and [ fig : g3topo ] , we have not drawn the topologies with the two worldlines interchanged , although they will be required for our calculations .",
    "now that we have established all topologies relevant to the calculation at 2pn , the powers of the orbital velocity @xmath42 must be counted .",
    "there are two possible sources for factors of @xmath42 in our calculations : ( 1 ) fields coupling to the worldlines , where the lo couplings of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath36 are @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , respectively , and ( 2 ) time derivatives , where @xmath62 for potential modes .",
    "time derivatives can arise from either purely gravitational interaction vertices or from propagator insertions , where each propagator insertion counts as @xmath61 .    with all relevant topologies and the counting rules for @xmath42 ,",
    "the final diagrams at 2pn can now be constructed .",
    "recall that the 2pn diagrams scale as either @xmath48 , @xmath63 , or @xmath50 .",
    "the diagrams are generated by first populating the topologies with the three gravitational fields @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath36 in all possible combinations .",
    "we then count the factors of @xmath42 which result from the gravitational fields coupling to the worldline , and any time derivatives acting on internal vertices .",
    "propagator insertions are also counted where appropriate .",
    "the powers of @xmath42 from the worldline vertices are kept to all orders in the calculations and only expanded to 2pn in the final result .",
    "the diagrams relevant at 2pn which result from this procedure are shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : calc ] , figs .",
    "[ fig_2png1 ] , [ fig_2png2 ] , and [ fig_2png3 ] .      in the ks parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ksmetric ] ) , we have introduced three fields , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath36 , instead of the standard @xmath30 parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hmunumetric ] ) .",
    "it will be necessary to keep track of these new fields , so one should ask what has been gained from a calculational perspective by using the ks parametrization .",
    "this question is answered by considering the static diagrams , i.e. those with no velocity factors .",
    "first , consider the topology fig .",
    "[ fig : g2topo]@xmath64 which involves a three - graviton vertex .",
    "this was used in @xcite to construct the eih potential in the @xmath30 variables .",
    "when the ks variables are employed , it was shown that this topology does not contribute at 1pn order @xcite .",
    "we discuss this in more detail since it points us to the source of the advantages of the ks variables .",
    "when working in the @xmath30 parametrization , one often considers its components @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 separately , since their lo coupling to the worldline scale as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "so in practice , in the @xmath30 and ks parametrizations , one must keep track of the same number of components or fields . returning to our discussion ,",
    "if we consider static diagrams , only the @xmath65 component can couple to the worldline .",
    "let us consider the static limit of the first topology which arises with gravitational self - couplings , fig .",
    "[ fig : g2topo]@xmath64 . with @xmath65 coupling to each worldline at lo , without any propagator insertions , the only possible source of powers of @xmath42 would be the three - graviton vertex . naively , one would isolate the action component with three powers of @xmath65 , which yields the 3-@xmath65 vertex .",
    "interestingly , one finds that the corresponding term in the action is proportional to @xmath68 , meaning that the 3-@xmath65 vertex has a power of @xmath45 associated with it .",
    "so does this mean that the topology in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2topo]@xmath64 does not enter at 1pn in the @xmath30 parametrization ? if this were true , then the eih calculation of @xcite would be contradicted .",
    "the reason why the above conclusion is wrong is the presence of mixing of the @xmath30 components .    to explain this point , consider the @xmath30 graviton propagator in harmonic gauge , which is given by @xmath69 .",
    "examining the tensor structure of the propagator , one can see @xmath65 mixes with the trace of @xmath67 , since @xmath70 .",
    "thus , a graviton which starts as @xmath65 at the worldline coupling can be either @xmath65 or @xmath71 at the three - graviton vertex .",
    "so instead of the 3-@xmath65 vertex , one has to use the three - point function @xmath72 .",
    "this three - point function is obtained by contracting the 3-@xmath73 vertex with three graviton propagators and setting all remaining free indices to @xmath74 .",
    "one then finds that there are components of the three - point function @xmath75 which do not involve time derivatives , and so the topology fig .",
    "[ fig : g2topo]@xmath64 is required at 1pn in the @xmath30 parametrization . clearly , the topology fig .",
    "[ fig : g2topo]@xmath64 only survives at 1pn in the @xmath30 parametrization because @xmath65 can mix with @xmath71 as it propagates .",
    "the major advantage of the ks parametrization in harmonic gauge is that it removes this kind of mixing , since the two - point functions between the three fields are zero : @xmath76 .",
    "for the topology fig .",
    "[ fig : g2topo]@xmath64 to contribute to the eih potential in the ks parametrization , all of the fields coupling to the worldlines must be @xmath33 s , since only they couple at @xmath77 .",
    "knowing that @xmath33 can not mix with @xmath34 or @xmath36 , the 3-@xmath33 vertex must be used .",
    "when the gravitational lagrangian is examined , the only relevant term is proportional to @xmath78 , where the two time derivatives in this term cause the 3-@xmath33 vertex to be of @xmath61 in the orbital velocity . therefore , the diagrams resulting from the topology fig .",
    "[ fig : g2topo]@xmath64 do not contribute until 2pn in the ks parametrization .",
    "this argument can be extended to the @xmath52-@xmath33 vertex @xmath79 , where the relevant term in the gravitational action is @xmath80 .",
    "any @xmath52-@xmath33 vertex is then suppressed by one order in the pn expansion because there are always two time derivatives .",
    "thus , in the ks parametrization , the @xmath81 topologies fig . [",
    "fig : g3topo]@xmath82 , and @xmath83 will not enter at 2pn .",
    "this will reduce the calculational effort considerably .",
    "also , the fact that the topology fig . [ fig : g2topo]@xmath64 first enters at 2pn , rather than 1pn , means that propagator insertions are not required for this topology at 2pn .",
    "we have established that the ks variables in harmonic gauge provide important calculational advantages over the @xmath30 parametrization used in @xcite at 2pn order . at 1pn ,",
    "this advantage was modest , since only one diagram topology was eliminated . at 2pn",
    ", we have found that four topologies at @xmath84 were removed , and one did not need propagator insertions at @xmath85 on the topology fig .",
    "[ fig : g2topo]@xmath64 . clearly as we proceed to higher order in the pn expansion , the advantages of the ks variables become more important .",
    "in this section , we present the calculation of the feynman diagrams which are required to determine the 2pn interaction potential between the binary constituents . using the feynman rules presented below",
    ", each diagram equals @xmath86 from which we extract its contribution to the potential @xmath87 .",
    "the symmetry factor for each diagram is computed in the usual manner @xcite , but one needs to account for the nonpropagating classical sources . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : powertopo ] , there are three classes of diagrams with the following power counting : @xmath50 , @xmath63 , and @xmath48 .",
    "we discuss how to evaluate each in turn , starting with the simplest at @xmath88 , and finishing with the more complex diagrams at @xmath84 .",
    "when calculating the diagrams , we work with the spatial fourier transform for the gravitational potential modes .",
    "for example , for the @xmath33 field , we will work in terms of @xmath89 , which is the spatial fourier transform of the coordinate space field @xmath90 , where @xmath91 .",
    "we also make clear that after expanding the metric in the ks fields @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath36 , we do not distinguish between upper and lower spatial indices ; they are lowered and raised with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "lastly , since we are interested in the long range potential only , we drop irrelevant contact terms , such as @xmath94 , wherever they appear in the calculations .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2png1 ] , there are six diagrams to be evaluated at @xmath96 .",
    "the contributions from the diagrams @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are the easiest of all diagrams to compute at 2pn , since we only need to compute simple one - graviton exchange diagrams .",
    "the feynman rules for couplings to the worldlines are derived from the point particle action in eq .",

    "we note that if the accelerations were replaced in our lagrangian , using the lo eom , @xmath10 is unchanged , although all intermediate expressions are different .",
    "this is because @xmath10 is physical and therefore gauge invariant , and using the eom at the level of the lagrangian corresponds to a change in gauge .",
    "we have demonstrated how to use the eft method @xcite to efficiently calculate the next - to - next - to - leading order lagrangian describing the conservative dynamics of a binary system .",
    "we have shown how to systematically determine all feynman diagrams which contribute to the 2pn lagrangian through the use of power counting in @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "the calculation involved 21 distinct diagrams , and we encountered integrals which correspond to one - loop and two - loop feynman integrals .",
    "all diagrams could be computed with only two master integrals .",
    "this demonstrates the efficiency of the eft method for the calculation of the 2pn lagrangian .    instead of a usual lorentz covariant metric parametrization , we employed a temporal kaluza - klein parametrization of the metric , proposed by kol and smolkin @xcite .",
    "when compared to the @xmath30 parametrization used in @xcite , we found that the ks variables reduced the number of diagrams by four at @xmath50 and avoided any propagator insertions in the three - graviton diagrams at @xmath204 .",
    "this reduced the amount of calculation significantly at 2pn .",
    "more generally , we conclude that the ks variables will significantly improve any calculations which are performed at higher order using nrgr methods .",
    "this is due to ( 1 ) the simple propagators obtained with this gauge and parametrization choice , ( 2 ) the suppression of @xmath205 vertices by one order in the pn expansion due to two time derivatives acting on the vertex , ( 3 ) not requiring time insertions in the @xmath205 topologies at the next order in the pn expansion , and ( 4 ) the advantageous compounding effect of the former points when higher order expansions are calculated .",
    "an interesting extension of the current calculation is to compute the 3pn potential .",
    "analogously to 2pn , where the four - point function formed diagrams which were the most difficult to evaluate , the hardest part of the calculation at 3pn is expected to involve a gravitational four - point function in @xmath206 diagrams . also , the number of diagrams one must evaluate at 3pn is much greater .",
    "this means more terms in the action will have to be computed to account for new vertices at @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and @xmath209 .",
    "our preliminary estimates show there are more than @xmath210 diagrams at 3pn , compared to the @xmath211 at 2pn . at 3pn , it will again be the case that a reduction in the number of diagrams can be achieved if the ks variables are employed .",
    "so while the 3pn calculation may prove challenging , the relative ease of the calculation at 2pn indicates that the nrgr calculation of the 3pn potential can be done .",
