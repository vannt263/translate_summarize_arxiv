    "is interpreted similarly ( at each fixed @xmath14 ) . hence , and should be understood in the sense of distributions , even though the solutions will be smooth outside of @xmath11 .",
    "problem  belongs to a family of models featuring the competition between self - focusing cubic and defocusing quintic terms , that have drawn considerable attention in both the physical and the mathematical communities in recent years , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "this combination of nonlinearities is well known in optical media , including liquid waveguides @xcite and speciality glasses @xcite .",
    "especially interesting are colloids containing metallic nanoparticles , where the cq nonlinearity can be widely adjusted by selecting the radius of the suspended nanoparticles and the colloidal filling factor @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the one - dimensional nls equation with the cq nonlinearity admits completely stable exact soliton solutions @xcite , although this equation is not integrable .",
    "the exact soliton solutions are available , and stable too , also in the case when both the cubic and quintic terms in the one - dimensional nls equation have the self - focusing sign @xcite .",
    "the rigorous stability analysis of one - dimensional nls solitons with general double - power nonlinearitities can be found in @xcite .",
    "then , the effective linear potential term added to the nls equation represents a trapping ( waveguiding ) structure for light beams , induced by an inhomogeneity of the local refractive index . in particular",
    ", the delta - function term adequately represents a narrow trap which is able to capture broad solitonic beams .    existence and stability of bound states of one - dimensional nls equations with a delta potential and a single power - law nonlinearity @xmath15 ,",
    "have been extensively discussed earlier .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more information about this . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the presence of the delta - function potential has several interesting consequences .",
    "the range of values of the propagation constant for solutions in free space ( i.e. , with @xmath16 ) is @xmath17 ( the same as for the above - mentioned exact soliton solutions in free space @xcite ) , and in this case the bifurcation diagram for the bound states is very simple , see fig .",
    "[ curve0.fig ] in section  [ num.sec ] .",
    "namely , the solutions can be parametrized by @xmath17 , they bifurcate from @xmath18 at @xmath19 , and their @xmath20 norm ( i.e. , the integral power of the beam in the optical models ) diverges as @xmath21 .",
    "this accounts for the saturation of the nonlinear refractive index for high - power beams in the cq optical media .",
    "the presence of the potential gives rise to a fold bifurcation point located to the right of @xmath22 .",
    "the bifurcating curve now starts off the trivial line at @xmath23 , can be parametrized by @xmath24 up to @xmath25 where it ` turns backwards ' , and again blows up in @xmath26 , but now as @xmath27 .",
    "the respective bifurcation diagrams are displayed in fig .",
    "[ curve1.fig][curve3.fig ] in section  [ num.sec ] , for various values of the coupling constant @xmath28 .",
    "this phenomenon was already observed in @xcite , where solitons in a cubic focusing  quintic defocusing medium with a square well potential were studied by means of numerical methods and the variational approximation . in the case of the delta - potential considered here",
    ", the fold bifurcation can be described by an exact analysis , as demonstrated in section  [ bif.sec ] .",
    "since the parametrization by @xmath24 breaks down at @xmath29 , where the linearization of becomes singular , we resort to the work of crandall and rabinowitz @xcite which provides the right framework to deal with this situation .",
    "an important remark at this stage is the multiplicity of positive solutions of for @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , the first step of our analysis , in section  [ expsol.sec ] , is the _ explicit determination of all positive solutions _ of , in terms of elementary functions ; this is a noteworthy feature of the present model .",
    "of course , the expressions obtained are somewhat cumbersome , yet we are able to extract important information from them , notably as regards the stability of the bound states of .",
    "we will thus show explicitly that , for each fixed @xmath30 , there are exactly two positive solutions of , and that the corresponding bound states of are both stable .",
    "bistability phenomenon _ was previously observed numerically in @xcite for the square well potential , see also @xcite .",
    "in the present context , we can prove the stability rigorously .",
    "the fact that the ` upper branch ' is stable , while the @xmath20 norm of the solutions is decreasing along it , appeared puzzling when it was first discovered in @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of a delta - potential considered here , a careful analysis of the spectrum of the linearization of reveals that it is strictly positive along the upper branch , and its stability then follows from the general theory of orbital stability in @xcite . along the ` lower branch ' , the linearized operator has one simple negative eigenvalue , and the rest of its spectrum is positive . in this case , the vakhitov ",
    "kolokolov ( vk ) stability criterion @xcite ( which requires that the @xmath20 norm is increasing in @xmath24 ) ensures the stability .",
    "note that , for each fixed @xmath31 , the positive solution of is unique , and the corresponding bound state is also stable .",
    "therefore , all positive solutions of give rise to stable bound states of .",
    "the stability analysis is carried out in full detail in section  [ stab.sec ] .",
    "the bistability of coexisting bound states with different powers and same propagation constant offers potential applications to optics in terms of switching and other elements of all - optical data processing @xcite .",
    "we would also like to comment on the important role symbolic computer calculations ( using mathematica ) and numerical simulations played in our analysis .",
    "mathematica was a powerful tool to compute exact formulas that were too involved to be dealt with manually .",
    "this transpires both in the calculation of solutions in the regime @xmath30 in section  [ expsol.sec ] , and in the stability analysis of section  [ stab.sec ] . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical experiments were very useful at early stages of this work , in order to understand the behavior of solutions , before their explicit representations had been found .",
    "we used the so - called ` continuous normalized gradient flow ' ( cngf ) , which was studied and implemented in @xcite in the context of the nls equation with a cubic nonlinearity .",
    "the excellent agreement between the numerical and the exact solutions ( see fig .  [ fig2][fig6 ] ) demonstrates the effectiveness of this scheme in the context of .",
    "the cngf method being based on constraint minimization ( see section  [ num.sec ] ) , this also suggests that the positive solutions of should admit a variational characterization .",
    "our analytical approach allows us to describe the spectral and stability properties of the bound states of without resorting to such a variational characterization .",
    "this would however present an interest on its own ; see for instance @xcite for results in this direction in the case of a delta - potential combined with a single power nonlinearity .",
    "lastly , it is relevant to mention that recent numerical and analytical considerations have demonstrated that the same delta - like attractive potential may effectively stabilize trapped solitons in the nls equation with a combination of defocusing cubic and focusing quintic terms ( the signs opposite to those dealt with in the present work ) @xcite . in the free - space version of the latter equation , all solitons are completely unstable .",
    "we first establish some elementary properties of positive solutions of .",
    "[ basic.prop ] let @xmath32 and @xmath33 be a non - negative non - trivial ( i.e. , @xmath34 but @xmath35 ) solution of .",

    "iv ) , observing that @xmath43 satisfies the initial value problem @xmath44 where @xmath45 we conclude by cauchy s theorem that @xmath46 , which proves the claim .",
    "it turns out that all solutions described by proposition  [ basic.prop ] are in fact positive , that is , satisfy @xmath2 for all @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore  and this is quite remarkable  they can all be expressed in terms of elementary functions .",
    "as will be seen shortly , this is especially striking in the range of the propagation constant @xmath48 which is not allowed in free space ( i.e. , when @xmath49 ) @xcite .",
    "we will now determine _ all _ positive solutions of .",
    "first , multiplying by @xmath50 and integrating from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , respectively from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , we get @xmath55 in particular , taking the limit @xmath56 and using proposition  [ basic.prop ]  ( iii ) yields , assuming that @xmath57 , @xmath58 the solutions of which are @xmath59 note that both @xmath60 exist and are positive if and only if @xmath61 next , with a view of further integrating , we express @xmath62 as @xmath63 ( recall we seek solutions with @xmath64 ) .",

    "( see the bifurcation diagrams for various values of @xmath77 in section  [ num.sec ] . )",
    "notice , in particular , that regime ( a ) is void if @xmath78 , so _ we will suppose @xmath79 from now on_. also , we already see from the above analysis that a fold bifurcation occurs at @xmath25 where two distinct solutions merge and disappear ( there is no soliton for @xmath80 ) . from and the previous discussion , any positive solution of with @xmath81 decaying at infinity satisfies @xmath82 in particular , @xmath36 is even , @xmath83 for @xmath51 , and @xmath84 , so @xmath85 decays like @xmath86 as @xmath42 .",
    "now is a first order ode with separated variables , which can be integrated explicitly .",
    "alternatively , the solutions in regime ( a ) are easily constructed by applying some surgery to the known explicit solitons in free space , given in @xcite as @xmath87 the corresponding solutions pinned to the delta - potential with @xmath28 are obtained as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is determined by the jump condition in proposition  [ basic.prop ]  ( iii ) , which yields @xmath90 it is not difficult to check that this equation has a unique solution @xmath91 if @xmath92 . in fact this solution can be computed explicitly : @xmath93 thus , the solutions in take the form of @xmath94    for @xmath70 , a similar procedure applied to the ` front soliton ' given in eq .",

    "in other words , regime ( b ) above is void for @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , no free - space solutions are available that could be pinned to the delta - potential by the same sort of surgery as above , and one has to integrate the equation manually .",
    "we integrate using an euler substitution , which yields @xmath96 where the integration",

    "however , for given values of the parameters , the exact form of the solutions may be useful , especially in numerical calculations .",
    "for instance , at the fold bifurcation point , where @xmath25 , the solution takes the more tractable form : @xmath100    it can also be checked that , as @xmath101 , the solutions in converge to the corresponding free - space solitons in .",
