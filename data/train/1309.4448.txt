    "the complete pan - chromatic spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a source encodes a wealth of information concerning its age , mass , metallicity , dust / gas content , star formation rate ( sfr ) , star formation history ( sfh ) and more .",
    "various emission mechanisms account for the apparent shape and typical features found in seds .",
    "for example , dust reprocessing results in attenuation of optical / ultra - violet ( uv ) photons produced from stellar populations whose energy is then re - emitted at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths while specific species of ions and molecules produce emission / absorption features across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , our ability to extract information from observations is hampered both on the observational and theoretical sides . as observers",
    ", we try to make due with either coarse , broad - band sampling of a source s sed or with high resolution sampling of a small portion of the sed through spectroscopy .",
    "theorists , on the other hand , must make difficult decisions regarding which physics , spatial scales , and evolutionary histories to include in the creation of their sed libraries or synthesis models .    within the literature ,",
    "sed models can be sub - categorized into two main types .",
    "empirical models are derived for particular classifications based on a subset of similar sources ( e.g. arp 220 and m82 for starburst galaxies , the quasar mean template , etc . ) .",
    "these models offer the simplest approximation of a source s sed and are generally preferred when only sparse photometry is available or for coarse estimates of basic properties ( e.g. luminosity , sfr , colors ) .",
    "the underlying assumption behind empirical models , namely that all sources of that type have the same sed , is difficult to verify and so their use to probe all but the grossest properties is limited .",
    "theoretical models are constructed from sets of physical and radiative processes believed to be the dominant contributors to the emission of a source .",
    "functionally , these again are divided into two classes .",
    "pre - computed template libraries for particular source types are the most widely used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "since they are pre - computed , these libraries allow the rapid exploration of a pre - defined parameter space at the expense of being limited to the resolution and scope of the parameter space provided by the authors . for more generalized applications , sed synthesis packages are now available that offer a wider set of input parameters and the exploration of a continuous parameter space ( e.g. stellar population synthesis codes such as galaxev , @xcite and pan - chromatic galaxy synthesis codes like grasil , @xcite and cigale , @xcite )",
    "of course , one may use these packages to construct ones own template libraries ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) for specific applications as well . in both cases , as the generality of the underlying physics increases to provide relevance to a wider class of sources , so does the number of free parameters in the models .",
    "the unavoidable existence of correlations in these parameters insists that simply finding a best - fit parametrization is no longer sufficient .",
    "rather , we now require tools that properly reveal the complexities and correlations in the adopted model parameter space .    with this in mind , here we present the general purpose mcmc - based sed fitting code sed analysis through markov chains or satmc .",
    "monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) techniques are a set of methods based in the bayesian formalism which enable efficient sampling of multi - dimensional parameter spaces in order to construct a distribution proportional to the probability density distribution of the input parameters , known as the _ posterior parameter distribution _ or simply the _",
    "posterior_. the posterior identifies the nuances in parameter space , including any possible correlations , making mcmcs particularly useful for exploring sed models and libraries with high dimensionality .",
    "mcmc based sed fitting codes are relatively new but have been growing in popularity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to deriving the posterior for best fit parameter and confidence level estimation , satmc includes many features to aid in improving performance and allows users to easily incorporate additional knowledge and constraints on parameter space in the form of priors .",
    "additionally , satmc versions exist in both idl and python and both are modular and straightforward to use in any wavelength regime and for any class of sources .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by detailing the mcmc algorithm and the basic process for mcmc - based sed fitting .",
    "we then provide case examples displaying the versatility and accuracy of satmc compared to standard least - squares methods .",
    "as part of this demonstration , we also present a set of seds derived from satmc when used in conjunction with the sed synthesis routine grasil to a sample of x - ray selected starburst galaxies .",
    "these fits highlight the key advantages obtained from the mcmc - based approach and their agreement with similar classes of composite seds .",
    "the primary motivation for satmc is to provide a means for efficient sampling of a parameter space with @xmath4 free parameters in order to derive parameter estimates and their associated confidence intervals .",
    "this is accomplished by sampling an @xmath4-dimensional surface proportional to the probability density function of the parameters given the data @xmath5 , also referred to as the _ posterior _ parameter distribution .",
    "we determine the posterior through bayes theorem @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents our current knowledge of the parameters or _",
    "priors _ and @xmath8 is the probability of the data given the model parameters , often referred to as the likelihood @xmath9 .",
    "we shall define the general form of the likelihood according to @xmath10 where the product runs over the m observed data points @xmath11 whose individual variances are given by @xmath12 and the function @xmath13 represents the model observations @xmath14 for the set of @xmath15 parameters .",
    "note , however , that this prescription of @xmath9 assumes that the observations have gaussian distributed errors , an assumption we will return to later in   3.1 . in the following sections , we detail specific mcmc features that define the basic operation of satmc .      within the literature , there are a variety of sampling algorithms one may use to construct an mcmc ( e.g. metropolis - hastings or gibbs sampling ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . for satmc",
    ", we employ the metropolis - hastings algorithm which works as follows :    * generate a proposal distribution @xmath16 from which the candidate steps @xmath17 will be drawn * calculate the acceptance probability according to the likelihood ratio ( @xmath18min(1,@xmath19 ) ) * draw a uniformly distributed random number @xmath20 from 0 to 1 and accept the step if @xmath21 , reject otherwise * repeat for the next step    though the exact choice of @xmath16 is arbitrary , it is common to adopt an @xmath4-dimensional multivariate - normal distribution @xmath22(@xmath23 ) with @xmath24*i * where * i * is the identity matrix , @xmath25 is the variance of each parameter in * x * and @xmath26 for generating proposed steps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . following these works , it is found that the distribution @xmath22(@xmath27 ) should be tuned for optimal performance between the time necessary to reach a stable solution ( referred to as the _ burn - in _ period ) and sampling of the posterior , which may be achieved by adjusting @xmath22(@xmath23 ) until the resulting chains have acceptance rates of @xmath023 percent in the limit of large dimensionality .",
    "we therefore base our proposal distribution around an adaptive covariance matrix @xmath28 ( similar to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) such that samples are drawn from the multivariate - normal distribution now given by @xmath22(@xmath29 ) . to obtain an acceptance rate of @xmath023 percent , we start by initializing the covariance matrix for each chain as @xmath30*i * where @xmath25 is set proportional to the input parameter ranges . after a period of steps ,",
    "we then calculate @xmath28 directly from the chain over the previous interval , i.e. @xmath31)({\\bf x}-{\\rm e}({\\bf x}))^t]\\ ] ] where @xmath32 $ ] is the expectation value or weighted average of @xmath15 .",
    "following each period of steps , we compute the acceptance rate and scale @xmath28 if the acceptance rate is too high ( @xmath3326 percent ) or too low ( @xmath3420 percent ) .",
    "the covariance matrix is continuously updated until the target @xmath023 percent acceptance is reached , which allows @xmath28 to take on the shape of the underlying posterior to readily identify and account for possible correlations in the parameters .",
    "once the target acceptance rate has been reached , we then check for chain convergence to determine when the _ burn - in _ period is complete . in the mcmc literature",
    "there are many approaches to determine convergence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; we opt for the geweke diagnostic @xcite which compares the average and variance of samples obtained in the first 10 percent and last 50 percent of a chain segment .",
    "if the two averages are equal ( within the tolerance set by their variances ) , then the chain is deemed to be stationary and convergence is complete .",
    "we check both the acceptance rate and convergence , verifying the acceptance rate before checking for convergence , over a default period of 1000 steps until both have been satisfied .",
    "if necessary , the covariance matrix is modified to maintain the target acceptance rate .",
    "once both criteria are fulfilled , _ burn - in _ is completed and the chain(s ) are set to continue to provide sampling of the posterior .",
    "when constructing the posterior distribution , we must be careful to sample all of the nuances of parameter space as the posterior distribution is not guaranteed to be a smooth or even continuous function of the free parameters . as with all fitting approaches , the existence of _ local _ maxima in the posterior requires that either we known _ a priori _ the general location of the global maximum or we implement a sampling technique capable of increasing the probability of finding it . for example , one could choose to initialize a large number of chains that cover random locations throughout parameter space . while this approach is nearly guaranteed to find the global maximum , it is also extremely inefficient .",
    "satmc utilizes a technique known as `` parallel tempering '' ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which , in analogy to simulated annealing , uses several chains  each with progressive modifications to likelihood space parametrized as a statistical temperature  to search parameter space and exchange information about the posterior at each chain s location .",
    "for a given chain at temperature t , the likelihood is flattened according to @xmath35 .",
    "the tempered chains thus distort likelihood space , exchanging sensitivity to the details within posterior for the general shape , such that chains with higher temperatures will accept more steps , and thus sample larger regions of parameter space . by coupling these tempered chains ,",
    "we allow colder chains to access areas of parameter space they may have otherwise been unable to reach .",
    "the process for handling tempered chains works as follows :    * temperatures are assigned to chains in a progressive manner with one chain designated the fiducial cold chain with @xmath36 ( e.g. @xmath37 $ ] ) .",
    "* chains are allowed to progress for a set number of steps ( satmc uses 3 iterations of acceptance / convergence or 3000 steps by default ) * a swap of chain state information is proposed using the metropolis acceptance algorithm @xmath38 * the new set of chains is then allowed to run until the next swap of chain state information .",
    "this process of coupling individual chains with a metropolis - hastings acceptance algorithm was initially proposed by @xcite and is referred to as a metropolis coupled monte carlo markov chain or mc@xmath39 .",
    "when applying temperatures to individual chains , the sampling of each chain will vary due to the distortions of likelihood space ; i.e. , a chain at a higher temperature will accept more steps than a chain with an identical proposal distribution at lower temperature . to maintain a reasonable sampling of the tempered likelihoods , each chain",
    "is treated individually for the purposes of acceptance and convergence testing .",
    "note , however , that updating the tempered chains occurs only with the acceptance and convergence testing of the cold chain .",
    "this ensures that we obtain a proper sampling of the posterior without being influenced by the otherwise distorted likelihood space . in parallel tempering techniques , one can specify whether the potential swaps occur only between the cold and any tempered chain ( 0,@xmath40 ) or between adjacent chains ( @xmath411 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tempedchains ] ) .",
    "the former allows for rapid sampling and mixing of the chains to determine the global maximum and is thus used during the _ burn - in _ period .",
    "the latter passes state information down through the tempered chains so that the cold chain may access a more representative region of parameter space ; this method is used after _ burn - in _ to properly sample parameter space around the maximum likelihood . in this case , chains progress for a set length ( 500 steps by default ) whereafter the chain transitions are proposed .",
    "should a swap be made with the cold chain after _ burn - in _ is complete , we re - compute the acceptance rate and convergence as outlined in the previous section to verify proper sampling . due to the modified acceptance rate and misshapen likelihood space of the tempered chains , it is generally undesirable to use them in re - constructing the posterior parameter distribution .",
    "if there have been no swaps to the cold chain after 10 iterations , the temperatures of all chains are set to 0 and the mcmc is allowed to continue until sufficient samples of the posterior distribution around the maximum have been obtained .",
    "the methods presented in   2 are generalized for any mcmc - based algorithm . here , we detail specific modifications and methods utilized in satmc for sed fitting .      in order to perform a fit",
    ", satmc requires at least two sets of information : 1 ) a file containing the m observations including their wavelengths ( @xmath42 ) or frequencies ( @xmath43 ) , observed fluxes ( @xmath44 ) and corresponding uncertainties ( @xmath45 ) and 2 ) the model libraries . following from eqn .  2",
    ", we define the likelihood for a given set of observations and models as @xmath46 or similarly @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the model fluxes which for narrow passbands are interpolated model sed values at the observed frequency / wavelength .",
    "alternatively , @xmath48 may be calculated from a set of passbands with a given filter response ( @xmath49 as provided by the user ) as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are taken from the filter files .",

    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in cases where there is no detection but only an upper limit , satmc provides a parametrized probability distribution to allow the user to reflect their confidence in the underlying statistics of the observations .",
    "a simple approach for incorporating upper limits is to assume a step function accepting all models that fall below the limit and rejecting all that lie above . while attractive in its simplicity , this method harshly truncates regions of parameter space and improperly weights the upper limit s contribution to @xmath9 . to partially alleviate these issues",
    ", satmc implements a one - sided gaussian distribution so that models with fluxes above the upper limit may contribute to the posterior with a small but non - zero probability ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the one - sided gaussian is defined by @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents the cut - off transition from flat @xmath56=1 to a gaussian tail with standard deviation @xmath57 . parametrizing the probability distribution in this manner",
    "allows for a compromise between the simple step function , also available in satmc , and over - interpreting the shape of the noise distribution at small fluxes , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : osgauss ] .",
    "since redshift is just another parameter in a source s sed , satmc is capable of providing photometric redshift ( photo - z ) determinations for sources in the context of the input sed models .",
    "traditionally , photo - z codes implement least - squares methods ( e.g. hyperz * ? ? ?",
    "* ) though some recent codes have adopted the bayesian formalism for using priors ( e.g. bpz , @xcite ; eazy , @xcite ) .",
    "the standard approach in photo - z estimation is to apply an sed library ( often limited to a few galaxy types ) to find the photo - z and then repeat the fitting using the same ( or in some cases different ) library fixed at the photo - z to estimate source properties .",
    "this approach under - estimates the true errors on the photo - z and other fitted parameters .",
    "satmc fits the redshift simultaneously with all other parameters and produces a direct determination of the redshift - parameter probability distributions in addition to the marginalized redshift probability distribution @xmath58cdm with h@xmath59=70 , @xmath60=0.7 and @xmath61=0.3 . ] .",
    "we have tested and improved the photo - z estimation with satmc in collaboration with the candels team .",
    "@xcite provides a complete analysis of various photometric redshift estimation techniques for samples of candles galaxies in the goods - s field @xcite . out of the 13 participating groups ,",
    "satmc was the only mcmc - based code used to generate photo - z s . since the tests reported in dahlen et al .",
    ", we have reduced the outlier fraction ( fraction of sources with @xmath62 ) from @xmath09 - 14 percent to @xmath03 - 8 percent through modification of our input templates , luminosity priors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "as mcmc samplers require a continuous parameter space , satmc allows the user to incorporate sed synthesis routines ( e.g. galaxev , grasil , cigale ) to generate seds at candidate steps and compute the resulting likelihoods .",
    "empirical templates are often defined with a scalable normalization factor as one of the few ( if any ) free parameters which remains continuous when used with satmc . template libraries ,",
    "unfortunately , rarely offer a fully continuous parameter space ; often mixing sets of continuous ( e.g. model normalization ) and discretely sampled parameters . to create a pseudo - continuous space from such template libraries",
    ", satmc computes the likelihoods of models bracketing the current step according to eqns .",
    "5 & 8 and applies multi - linear interpolation to determine the likelihood of the current proposed step .",
    "we emphasize that satmc may be used for _ any _ class of sed models ( empirical , template library or synthesis routine ) , so long as the appropriate interface is constructed by the user .",
    "one should note , however , that there is a trade - off between the discretely sampled template libraries or empirical templates and continuous parameter space offered by sed synthesis routines ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since the run - time of the sed synthesis routines will dominate the mcmc calculation ( e.g. 3 + days run - time with grasil versus 3 - 5 minutes with a template library ) .",
    "regardless of which class of sed models one wishes to adopt , empirical and theoretical sed models are commonly derived for a particular physical process and/or over a particular wavelength regime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to fully reproduce a galaxy s sed , additional components may be required either to complete the wavelength coverage or to include a missing physical process ( e.g. adding agn emission to a star - formation template set ) .",
    "satmc will construct a linear combination of multiple input sed models under the assumption that the underlying physical processes are independent .",
    "the mcmc process itself does not change : the combination of two models with @xmath63 and @xmath64 free parameters , respectively , is viewed as a single model with @xmath65 parameters when calculating likelihoods and taking potential steps .      an added feature of satmc is the ability to include additional information to provide additional weights and constraints to likelihood space . in the bayesian formalism , this extra information forms the priors of eqn  1 . for our implementation",
    ", we expand the definition of priors from the traditional bayesian definition to include options for limiting and inherently correlating parameter space .",
    "this was deemed necessary for circumstances of fitting multiple template libraries where parameters from each model have the same physical interpretation and thus are not independent ( e.g. a@xmath66 from one model library and optical depth in another ) and cases where additional information not available to the fits is available ( e.g. restricting the age of a galaxy at a given redshift ) .",
    "a final feature of satmc lies in the determination of the posterior parameter distribution .",
    "as we store the likelihood and location in parameter space for each step , it becomes a simple task to construct parameter confidence intervals and even parameter - parameter confidence contours to examine relative parameter degeneracies ( see figure  [ fig : sk07 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , in order to visualize an @xmath4-dimensional parameter space , we must project or marginalize parameter space into a one or two dimensional form . when marginalizing sets of parameters , the true shape of the posterior will be distorted which may not reveal correlations in higher dimensions .",
    "this also leads to a simplification when reporting the confidence intervals on individual parameters as traditional terms such as 1@xmath53 imply gaussianity in the posterior which is unlikely to exist . instead ,",
    "one dimensional confidence levels are produced from the parameter range where 68 percent of all accepted steps are contained , marginalized over all other free parameters . throughout the text , errors quoted when derived from satmc",
    "refer to these marginalized parameter ranges .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     when developing sed models and deriving the associated parameters , there are certain attributes that must remain fixed in order to keep a consistent parametrization",
    ". examples of these attributes include the imf , spatial properties like the disk / bulge scale heights and radial distribution , and the form of the sfh .",
    "altering any of these properties changes the very nature of the models and is in no way continuous for mcmc samplers . in bayesian statistics ,",
    "it is possible to compare models of different parametrizations through the _ bayes factor _ to determine which model offers the best fit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the bayes factor follows from bayes theorem and is derived from the ratio of the posteriors for the two models @xmath67 and @xmath68 : @xmath69 the bayes factor is defined as the second term on the right - hand side ; the first term is the ratio of the prior probability of each model and is typically set to unity as the models are considered under equal weight .",
    "explicit calculation of the bayes factor ( @xmath70 ) involves integrating the likelihood distributions of each model ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) with the prior parameter distributions ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) according to @xmath75 while there are mcmc and bayesian based tools available that compute the bayes factor ( e.g. the bayesian inference engine bie , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such methods are not currently available in satmc .",
    "instead , we may follow a similar prescription by repeating the sed fits after changing the desired parametrization(s ) .",
    "we provide a brief example of this process by comparing the results obtained with the salpeter imf used in our initial fits and those obtained with a chabrier imf @xcite .",

    "we caution , however , that without results from a full sample and direct computation of the bayes factor , we can not differentiate between the two imfs at this time . without the bayes factors , one may include secondary observations , i.e. spectroscopy and sed independent estimates of fitted and/or derived parameters , to derive priors and determine which , if any , of the fits best describe all observations .              as mentioned in   2.2 , whenever an sed synthesis routine is used in satmc ,",

    "<S> we present the general purpose spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting tool sed analysis through markov chains ( satmc ) . utilizing monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) algorithms </S>",
    "<S> , satmc fits an observed sed to sed templates or models of the user s choice to infer intrinsic parameters , generate confidence levels and produce the posterior parameter distribution . </S>",
    "<S> here we describe the key features of satmc from the underlying mcmc engine to specific features for handling sed fitting . </S>",
    "<S> we detail several test cases of satmc , comparing results obtained to traditional least - squares methods , which highlight its accuracy , robustness and wide range of possible applications . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a sample of submillimetre galaxies that have been fitted using the sed synthesis routine grasil as input . </S>",
    "<S> in general , these smgs are shown to occupy a large volume of parameter space , particularly in regards to their star formation rates which range from @xmath030 - 3000 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 and stellar masses which range from @xmath3 m@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> taking advantage of the bayesian formalism inherent to satmc , we also show how the fitting results may change under different parametrizations ( i.e. , different initial mass functions ) and through additional or improved photometry , the latter being crucial to the study of high - redshift galaxies .    </S>",
