    "analyses of the low - energy @xmath4 and @xmath5 semileptonic transitions play a decisive role in our understanding of the interplay between weak and strong interactions and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark - mixing matrix .",
    "current determinations of @xmath6 and @xmath7 provide the most precise constraints on the size of the ckm matrix elements and yield the most stringent test of ckm unitarity . in particular , the best determination of @xmath7 is achieved from kaon semileptonic ( @xmath8 ) and leptonic ( @xmath9 ) decays , whereas the most precise determination of @xmath6 is obtained from superallowed @xmath10 fermi transitions and also , to a minor extent , from baryon semileptonic decays most commonly from neutron beta decay and pion beta decay .    over the past years , precise measurements have been made in both kaon and baryon semileptonic decays @xcite . in these experiments the statistical errors are rather small , and",
    "more effort has been put into the reduction of the systematic errors , which are mainly of two kinds .",
    "the first one comes from the different shortcomings of the experimental devices .",
    "the second one , of a theoretical nature , comprises assumptions about form factors and radiative corrections .    on the one hand ,",
    "while the leptonic part of @xmath4 and @xmath5 semileptonic transitions is unambiguous , the hadronic part is affected by flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking in the form factors . for @xmath8",
    "decays there is a remarkable simplification because only the vector part of the weak current has a nonvanishing contribution and only two form factors appear .",
    "these form factors are protected by the ademollo - gatto theorem @xcite against su(3 ) breaking corrections to lowest order in @xmath11 so that the theoretical approach to compute them is under reasonable control within the limits of experimental precision .",
    "in contrast , baryon semileptonic decays play an ancillary role due to the presence of both vector and axial - vector currents and the appearance of six form factors .",
    "although the leading vector form factor is also protected by the ademollo - gatto theorem , large theoretical uncertainties arise from first - order su(3 ) breaking effects in the axial - vector form factors .    on the other hand ,",
    "the precise and reliable calculation of radiative corrections to the various measurable quantities accessible to current experiments is a rather difficult task . despite the enormous progress achieved in the understanding of the fundamental interactions with the standard model ,",
    "no first - principles calculation of radiative corrections to kaon and baryon semileptonic decays is yet possible .",
    "thus , in dealing with these radiative corrections it is very important to have an organized systematic approach to deal with the complications and technical difficulties that accompany them .",
    "these radiative corrections depend on the details of strong and weak interactions present in the decay vertex ; i.e. , they have a model - dependent part .",
    "they also depend on the charge assignments of the decaying and emitted hadrons .",
    "furthermore , their final form depends on the observed kinematical and angular variables and on certain experimental conditions .",
    "various articles on radiative corrections to @xmath8 decays exist in the literature , each with a different emphasis .",
    "some of the earliest attempts can be traced back to the works by ginsberg @xcite , becherrawy @xcite , garca and maya @xcite , and more recently by cirigliano _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite , bytev _ et .",
    "@xcite , and andre @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "ginsberg , for instance , focused on the calculation of radiative corrections to the lepton spectrum , dalitz plot , and decay rates of @xmath8 decays , by assuming a phenomenological weak @xmath12-@xmath13 vertex ; the results depend on a cutoff .",
    "becherrawy , in turn , used a particular model of the strong interactions , whereas garca and maya extended to @xmath14 the procedure proposed by sirlin @xcite , originally introduced to study the radiative corrections to the charged lepton spectrum in neutron beta decay .",
    "al . _ computed these radiative corrections in the framework of the chiral perturbation theory and accounted for virtual photons and leptons .",
    "bytev _ et .  al .",
    "_ , in turn , presented an alternative approach to remove the ultraviolet cutoff dependence and set it equal to the @xmath15 mass .",
    "finally , andre focused his analysis on @xmath16 decays and included contributions from outside the kinematically allowed three - body region of the dalitz plot .",
    "as for baryon semileptonic decays , following the analysis of sirlin of the virtual radiative corrections in neutron beta decay @xcite and armed with the theorem of low for the bremsstrahlung radiative corrections @xcite , it has been shown that the model dependence that arises in this latter case contributes to the order of @xmath17 for @xmath18 and that such model dependence can be absorbed into the already existing form factors @xcite , while the model - independent contributions can be extracted from orders @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the mass of the decaying baryon , and @xmath2 is the four - momentum transfer .",
    "this approach has been implemented to compute high - precision radiative corrections to various observables in baryon semileptonic decays ( decay rates and angular spin - asymmetry coefficients ) by considering unpolarized and polarized decaying and emitted baryons @xcite , for all possible charge assignments .    in this paper , we reexamine the calculation of radiative corrections to @xmath0 decays up to the order of @xmath1 , where @xmath3 denotes the mass of the kaon .",
    "our analysis builds on earlier works , particularly ref .",
    "@xcite , but unlike it , here we will focus on the radiative corrections to the dalitz plot of @xmath0 decays .",
    "our approach to the calculation of these radiative corrections has been to advance results which can be established as much as possible once and for all .",
    "this task is considerably biased by the experimental precision attained in given experiments and by the available phase space in each decay .",
    "the radiative corrections obtained to the order of approximation considered here are then suitable for model - independent experimental analyses and are valid to an acceptable degree of precision .",
    "we assume that the form factors can be extracted from experiment , and thus we do not consider them here .",
    "their model - independent parts contain information only on qed .",
    "our results will be presented in two forms : one where the triple integration over the real photon three - momentum is left indicated and ready to be performed numerically and another one , of analytical nature , where such an integration has been performed .",
    "both forms can be used to numerically cross - check one another . however , the analytical result , although tedious to feed into a monte carlo program , can help in the reduction of computer time because the triple integration involved does not have to be performed within the monte carlo calculation every time the energies of the charged lepton and the pion or the form factors are changed .",
    "this paper in organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : thkl3 ] , we introduce our notation and conventions ; also we briefly discuss some basic aspects of the phenomenology of kaon semileptonic decays and define the boundaries of the allowed kinematical region , usually referred to as the dalitz plot .",

    "we , however , proceed further in order to analytically perform these integrals , and we present the resultant expressions .",
    "we also present some cross - checks for completeness .",
    "we summarize our findings in sec .",
    "[ sec : close ] , where we also carry out a detailed numerical evaluation of these radiative corrections at several points of the dalitz plot ; this way we are able to compare our results with others already published , in particular , with refs .",

    "in this section , we provide a basic description of the phenomenology about kaon semileptonic decays in order to introduce our notation and conventions .    for definiteness",
    ", we concentrate on the analysis of the semileptonic decay of a positively charged kaon , namely , @xmath21 because the corresponding charge conjugate mode can be analyzed in a similar way . the four - momenta and masses of the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25",

    "the allowed kinematical region in the variables @xmath40 and @xmath41 for kaon semileptonic decays , usually referred to as the dalitz plot , is determined by energy and momentum conservation .",

    "[ fig : kinem ] , in which we have distinguished two areas labeled as tbr ( three - body region ) and fbr ( four - body region ) .",

    "( b )    the former ( the shaded region in this figure ) is bounded by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 whereas the latter is delimited by @xmath45 where @xmath46    the distinction between these two areas is subtle and requires some discussion .",
    "first , let us notice that in order to find an event with energies @xmath40 and @xmath41 in area fbr a fourth particle must exist ( in our case , such a particle will be a photon ) which will carry away finite energy and momentum .",
    "in contrast , in area tbr this particle may or may not do so .",
    "it turns out that area fbr is exclusively a four - body region , whereas area tbr is both a three- and a four - body region .",
    "hereafter , areas tbr and fbr will be loosely referred to as the three- and four - body regions of the dalitz plot , respectively .",
    "we can now proceed to the construction of the uncorrected transition amplitude ( i.e. , the amplitude without radiative corrections ) for process  ( [ eq : kl3p ] ) . by neglecting scalar and tensor contributions and assuming that only the vector current contributes , such an amplitude , denoted here by @xmath47 , has the structure @xmath48 , \\label{eq : m0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the fermi constant as extracted from muon decay",

    "furthermore , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the dirac spinors of the corresponding particles , @xmath56 , and the metric and @xmath57-matrix convention we adopt is the standard one ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , except that our @xmath58 has the opposite sign .",
    "the hadronic matrix element @xmath59 , on the other hand , can be written as @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the four - momentum transfer and @xmath62 are dimensionless form factors which are relatively real if time reversal holds .",
    "let us remark that the momentum transfer dependence of the form factors has been discussed extensively in the literature ; in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite provides an overview about the current situation of both the theoretical and experimental bent . in summary ,",
    "a common practice advocated in @xmath63 analyses is the use of a linear parametrization such as @xmath64 , \\label{eq : ffq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 are slope parameters .",
    "most @xmath63 data are well described by this parametrization for @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "recent analyses , however , have opted to use the @xmath67 parametrization instead , which is based on the introduction of an alternative set of form factors , namely , @xmath68 where the vector and scalar form factors @xmath69 and @xmath70 represent the @xmath71 and @xmath72 wave projections of the crossed channel @xmath73 , respectively . again , if it is assumed that @xmath74 follows a linear parametrization and @xmath75 is constant , then @xmath76.\\ ] ]    finally , another parametrization which has gained a renewal of interest is the dispersive parametrization @xcite , which is based on dispersive techniques and the low - energy @xmath12-@xmath13 phases to parametrize the form factors , both scalar and vector .",
    "as we have pointed out in the introductory section , we assume that the form factors are determined from experiment and will not be determined here .",
    "therefore , once the decay amplitude @xmath47 is defined the uncorrected differential decay rate for process ( [ eq : kl3p ] ) , represented here by @xmath77 , can readily be obtained by standard techniques .",
    "the differential decay rate is thus given by @xcite @xmath78 the integral over the three - momentum of the neutrino is straightforward .",
    "besides , the integrals over the angular variables facilitate if , without loss of generality , we orient the coordinate axes in such a way that @xmath24 is emitted along the @xmath79 axis and @xmath23 is emitted in the first or fourth quadrant of the @xmath80 plane .",
    "then , the only nontrivial angular integration is over @xmath81 , namely @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84    after some rearrangements , the resultant expression can be cast into the compact form @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a function of the kinematical variables and depends quadratically on the form factors .",

    "the expected error by the omission of higher order terms is around @xmath124 in @xmath121 and @xmath122 decays .",
    "being conservative , if the accompanying factors amount to 1 order of magnitude increase , then we can estimate an upper bound to the theoretical uncertainty of 1.2% .",
