    "soft @xmath2-ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are sources of recurrent , short ( @xmath3 ) , intense ( @xmath4 ) bursts of @xmath2-ray emission with a soft energy spectrum .",
    "the normal pattern of sgr activity are intense activity periods which can last weeks or months , separated by quiescent phases lasting years or decades .",
    "the five known sgrs are located in our galaxy or , in the case of sgr 0526 - 66 , in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the two most intense sgr bursts ever recorded were the 5 march 1979 giant flare of sgr 0526 - 66 ( mazets et al .  1979 ) and the similar 27 august 1998 giant flare of sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "the peak luminosities of these events ( @xmath5 ) exceeded the peak luminosities of `` normal '' sgr bursts by a factor @xmath6 .",
    "several sgrs have been found to be x - ray pulsars with an unusually high spin - down rate of @xmath7  s@xmath8 , usually attributed to magnetic braking caused by a super - strong magnetic field @xmath9 g , which leads to the interpretation that sgrs are magnetars ( golenetskij et al .  1979 ; duncan & thompson 1992 , kouveliotou et al .  1998 , kouveliotou et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the magnetar model ,",
    "the magnetic field is the likely provider of the burst energy .",
    "a common scenario assumes that magnetic stresses create a quake in the crust of the neutron star , which then ejects hot plasma alfvn waves through its rigid magnetosphere ( thompson & duncan 1995 ; 1996 ) .",
    "the magnetic field of such a star would have grown to magnetar - scale strengths because of strong convection during the collapse of the proto - neutron star core ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1993 ) .      in the magnetar model of sgrs , which is also that of anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , the x - rays are ultimately powered by an internally decaying very strong magnetic field",
    ". however there are still a few open questions which in our opinion leave room for new models to be explored :    * despite numerous attempts , no magnetars have been detected at radio frequencies ( kriss et al .",
    "1985 ; coe et al .",
    "1994 ; lorimer et al .",
    "1998 ; gaensler et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that qed processes at high @xmath10 , such as photon splitting , may preclude the electron / positron cascades necessary to produce radio emission ( baring&harding 2001 ) , or that pair production ceases above some critical magnetic field ( zhang & harding 2000 ) .",
    "these ideas or alternatives remain to be confirmed and are still debatable .",
    "* one might expect high-@xmath10 radio pulsars to be more x - ray bright than low-@xmath10 sources , and to possibly exhibit axp - like burst emission",
    ". however x - ray observations of 5 high-@xmath10 radio pulsars reveal luminosities much smaller ( by a few orders of magnitudes ) than those of axps ( pivovaroff et al . 2000 ; gonzalez & safi - harb 2003 ; mclaughlin et al . 2003 ; gonzalez et al . 2004 ; kaspi & mclaughlin 2005 ) .",
    "this has lead to suggestions that high-@xmath10 radio pulsars may one day emit transient axp - like emission , and conversely that the transient axps might eventually exhibit radio pulsations ( kaspi & mclaughlin 2005 )  a notion yet to be confirmed . * hints of massive ( @xmath11 ) progenitors associated with axps and sgrs by recent observations ( gaensler et al . 2005 ) has led to the suggestion that pulsars and sgrs differ in their progenitor masses .",
    "it is also suggested that massive progenitors could lead to neutron stars with millisecond periods ( heger et al .",
    "2004 ) which would comply with the magnetar model for sgrs ( duncan & thompson 1992 ) .",
    "this , however , leaves open the question of why high-@xmath10 pulsars , formed from less massive progenitors ( presumably with periods @xmath12 ms ) , possess magnetar - like field strengths . *",
    "all sgrs and axps known to date have spin periods between 6 and 12 seconds ( kaspi 2004 ) .",
    "this clustering in period remains to be explained by the magnetar model .",
    "here we explore an alternative model first presented by ouyed et al .",
    "( 2004 ) where one assumes that axps and sgrs are quark stars , rather than magnetars . while quark stars have yet to be found in nature , formation scenarios have been suggested in the literature ( see sect .",
    "8.4 in ouyed et al . 2004 and",
    "references therein ) .",
    "the qualitative idea is that the core of a neutron star reaches deconfinement densities , eventually leading to the conversion of the entire star to a quark star . in principle",
    ", the transition from hadronic matter into quark matter in the core of a neutron star can happen immediately during or after the supernova explosion , but also much later than that .",
    "such a transition could occur in a smooth stable manner ( e.g. bombaci & datta 2000 and references therein ) or in an explosive manner termed the `` quark - nova '' ( ouyed et al .",
    "2002 ; kernen , ouyed , & jaikumar 2005 ) . in these formation scenarios , if the quark star is born shortly after the supernova , the emitted energy / radiation would be absorbed by the still expanding supernova ejecta , and there would be no detectable signature of the transition .",
    "the hadron - quark transition may also happen much later than the supernova explosion and could be induced , for example , by accretion if the neutron star is a member of a binary , or via spin - down in the case of isolated neutron stars .",
    "the new idea of this model , first presented in ouyed et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , is that the quark star enters a superconductive phase , and subsequently experiences a `` meissner phase '' that triggers the reorganization of the star s magnetic field . before going into more details",
    "we first describe properties of quark matter and the concept of color superconductivity .",
    "the discovery of asymptotic freedom , leading to the formulation of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as the theory of strong interactions , was soon followed by the suggestion that matter at sufficiently high densities consists of a deconfined phase of quarks @xcite . only shortly",
    "afterwards it was pointed out @xcite that the true ground state of cold dense quark matter exhibits color superconductivity ( csc ) , characterized by diquark condensation with an estimated energy gap @xmath13 between the highest occupied and the unperturbed quark state at the fermi surface . since this magnitude of the gap is rather small for phenomenological applications , csc subsequently received little attention .",
    "the situation changed when reinvestigations @xcite , using nonperturbative forces ( , instanton - induced ) , showed that the gap can be substantially larger , @xmath14 for moderate quark chemical potentials , @xmath15 .",
    "similarly large values are obtained from estimates based on perturbative calculations at asymptotically high densities @xcite .",
    "thus , from the practical point of view , the existence of color superconductivity in compact stars has ( re-)emerged as an exciting possibility .",
    "the detailed properties of csc matter relevant to astrophysical applications depend on the interplay of the quark chemical potential , the @xmath16-@xmath16 interaction strength , and the bare masses of the ( light ) quarks @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in particular , for @xmath20 below the ( constituent ) strange quark mass , only @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks are subject to cooper pairing .",
    "the corresponding phase is known as 2-flavor csc ( 2sc ) . in the idealized case where the quark chemical potential is much larger than the strange quark mass ( @xmath21 ) , the latter becomes negligible and all three flavors exhibit likewise pairing .",
    "the preferred symmetry ( breaking ) pattern in this phase corresponds to the so - called color - flavor locking ( cfl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since the underlying diquark condensate is invariant only under simultaneous color and flavor transformations . in the present work ,",
    "we will focus on the cfl phase ( for a recent review and a more exhaustive list of references , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . associated with csc is the critical temperature , @xmath22 , above which pairing is washed out .",
    "one of the most interesting properties of an ordinary superconductor is the meissner effect , i.e. , the expulsion of magnetic flux from the superconductor @xcite . in the cfl phase ,",
    "the gauge bosons connected with the broken generators obtain masses , which indicates the meissner screening effect @xcite .",
    "this is the heart of our model which we describe next .",
    "assume a quark star is born with a temperature @xmath23 and enters the cfl phase as it cools by neutrino emission ( kernen , ouyed & jaikumar 2005 ) .",
    "the cfl front quickly expands to the entire star followed by the formation of rotationally induced vortices , analogous to rotating superfluid @xmath24he ( the vortex lines are parallel to the rotation axis ; tilley&tilley 1990 ) . via the effect",
    ", the magnetic field is partially screened from the regions outside the vortex cores .",
    "the system now consists of alternating regions of superconducting material with a screened magnetic field , and the vortices where most of the magnetic field resides . as discussed in ouyed et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , this has interesting consequences on how the surface magnetic field can adjust to the interior field which is pinned to the vortices .",
    "figure  [ fig : init_state ] shows the starting point for this reorganization of the magnetic field , just after the meissner effect has fully aligned the magnetic flux inside the star with the rotation axis . within a transition region , the magnetic field switches from the vertical interior field to that of an inclined dipole outside . a conservative assumption ( from the energetics point of view )",
    "is that the field in the transition region is a potential field ( minimum - energy configuration ) .    in order to capture the complex non - linear dynamics of the system we need the help of 3-d simulations .",
    "these simulations will allow us to follow the evolution and re - organization of the magnetic field induced by the vortices .",
    "the paper is presented as follows : in   [ sec : setup ] we describe and analyze the basic setup of our simulations .",
    "we calculate the synchrotron light curves that result from the simulations wherein we find remarkable similarities to sgr light curves .",
    "mechanisms for the observed subsequent bursts and the quiescent phase in sgrs are then briefly discussed in terms of our model in   [ sec : vortices ] . in   [ sec : predict ] we discuss the model predictions and how it can account , at least in its current stage , for the points listed in   [ sec : open_issues ] . here",
    "we suggest a list of observations that could test our model .",
    "we conclude in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "two fundamental parameters of our model are the inclination angle @xmath25 of the external dipole field relative to the rotation axis , and @xmath26 , the initial ratio of gas to magnetic pressure at the surface .",
    "the simulations start with the interior magnetic field confined in vertical vortices for @xmath27 , but with a still unperturbed inclined dipole field for @xmath28 .",
    "the transition region @xmath29 is filled by a potential field and is bounded by two current layers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : init_state ] ) .",
    "the whole configuration was chosen by minimizing the total magnetic energy ( see appendix  [ sec : fieldconf ] ) .",
    "we solve the following set of non - ideal magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) equations , using the pencil - code ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath30 here @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath19 are density , velocity , magnetic vector potential , and specific entropy , respectively .",
    "parameters and functions kept constant were @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 corresponding to specific heat , gravity potential , kinematic viscosity and magnetic diffusivity respectively .",
    "the remaining variables @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the sound speed , electric current density , magnetic flux density , traceless rate - of - strain tensor , and temperature , respectively .",
    "the length scale is in units of the radius of the quark star , @xmath43 , density in units of the star s surface density , @xmath44 , and time is in units of the spin - period , @xmath45 .",
    "this implies that velocities are in units of @xmath46 , while the magnetic field is in units of @xmath47 .",
    "the strength of the ( dipole ) magnetic field at the surface can be estimated for a given @xmath48 as , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the pressure at the surface of the star .",
    "using hydrostatic balance and the perfect gas law this becomes , @xmath51 in the equation above , @xmath44 is the average density of the gas close to the surface of the star .",
    "this corona is supplied by fall - back material following the formation of the qs ( kernen , ouyed , & jaikumar 2005 ) similar to what has been suggested in the supernova case @xcite . the density of the fallback matter",
    ", representative of the crust material of the parent neutron star , is estimated to be of the order of @xmath52 .",
    "note that our mhd equations ( [ eq - continuity])([eq - entropy ] ) are non - relativistic .",
    "while near the surface of the quark star some aspects of the physics will be considerably changed by relativistic effects , we expect that the overall dynamics will not be vastly different in a more realistic calculation .",
    "all figures shown here are for resolution @xmath53 .",
    "we have run simulations at higher resolution , but found that they differ little as far as energetics and evolution are concerned .",
    "figures  [ fig : xz_plane][fig : xy_plane ] show the evolution of the exterior magnetic field as it adjusts to the vortex - confined field .",
    "the complicated structure of the surface magnetic field is clearly seen in the animations driven by the frequent magnetic reconnections as the surface field tries to align itself with the interior one ( rotation axis ) .",
    "these random reconnection events would bear many similarities to the initial events (  those near @xmath54 ) , but we expect them to be less energetic as the magnetic field slowly decays and weakens .",
    "eventually , the magnetic field evolves into a stable configuration ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : xz_plane ] ) after which the star enters a quiescent phase .",
    "the restructuring of the field in the transition region leads to an approximately spherical alfvn wave traveling outwards ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : xz_plane ] for @xmath55 ) and is more prominent in simulations with a stronger magnetic field (  smaller @xmath26 ) . as the wave travels outwards it amplifies the magnetic field in certain regions causing them to undergo reconnection , which both distorts the wave and eventually damps it out .",
    "furthermore , the regions that underwent reconnection appear to show slow oscillatory motions between the reconnection site and the surrounding gas ( `` breathing '' ) . this can be seen in the series of diminishing pulses in fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity_time ] and the frequency of the pulses remains nearly constant ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fft ] ) .",
    "we note that these pulses appear more prominently in simulations with lower @xmath26 and do not arise in simulations with @xmath56",
    ".      the magnetic energy released in the organization is shown in fig .  [ fig : intensity_time ] and can be cast into a simple equation , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the fraction of the surface magnetic field that decayed via reconnection events . from fig .",
    "[ fig : em_time ] we can infer the decay in magnetic energy to be roughly @xmath59 @xmath60 - @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , if we assume the electrons to be co - rotating ( @xmath62 ) , then the intensity emitted by synchrotron processes from the simulated region goes as @xmath63 .",
    "also , assuming peak emission is at @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the critical frequency ( see sects .  6.2 and 6.4 in rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , we find this emission to be in the x - ray band , @xmath66^{1/2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where gravitational redshift is included in the last term .",
    "this intensity decays temporally in a way closely resembling sgr bursts ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : intensity_time ] ) .",
    "the decay profiles of our simulated bursts depend on the initial plasma @xmath26 at the surface of the star and on the dipole inclination @xmath25 .",
    "varying these parameters in our model allows us to fit the exponential decay shape and duration of observed bursts .",
    "the oscillations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fft ] , can be interpreted as magnetic `` breathing '' modes . in this situation , regions where magnetic reconnection occurs cause a disparity in the magnetic pressure between neighbouring regions .",
    "this low pressure region will draw plasma in from the surrounding regions causing either more reconnection or enhanced density where , in either case , there will be oscillations in the emission (  @xmath67 ) .",
    "furthermore , since our simulation is performed in the co - rotating frame , our model is too simplistic to reproduce a spin - modulated pattern ( e.g. the 8.0 s period observed in the march 5 event ) superimposed on a smooth exponential decay in the light curves .",
    "however , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : xz_plane][fig : xy_plane ] , there are hotter regions with more magnetic reconnection events than others , and so spin modulation should occur naturally .",
    "we note that a few of these hot spots appear simultaneously at random locations , implying spin - modulation may consist of even smaller sub - pulses , therefore producing many harmonics in the light curve . in other words , if our model is a correct representation of sgrs , observations could constrain the number of hot spots .",
    "we note that since the cfl phase transition occurs only once in a given star , there is only one giant burst in our model . however ,",
    "if we assume some form of heating , then it is possible that the quark star can revert to a non - cfl state wherein superconductivity is lost , and the interior magnetic field lines are no longer constrained to the vortices .",
    "then presumably the dynamics that initially caused the magnetic dipole axis to misalign with the rotation axis , we speculate , should once again ensue to some extent .",
    "thus we allow for the possibility of subsequent misalignment of the magnetic axis that , upon further cooling back below the deconfinement temperature , can trigger the same process as before to give subsequent bursts .",
    "one might expect these bursts strengths to depend on the amount of heating and resulting misalignment .",
    "possible sources of subsequent heating can include accretion from a companion , impact from the accretion of a small body , or the quark star passing through a higher density region in the ism .",
    "this leads to the prediction that radio emission should pick up again slightly before the subsequent bursts , provided there is a favourable line - of - sight .",
    "the accurate measurement of the temperature in the star in these subsequent bursts would now allow observations of the deconfinement temperature , which has eluded qcd physicists so far .",
    "the quiescent phase is due to vortex expulsion from spin - down and subsequent annihilation through magnetic reconnection near the surface .",
    "the number of vortices decrease slowly with spin - down leading to continuous , quiescent energy release which can last for @xmath68 to @xmath69 years ( see ouyed et al .",
    "2004 for more details ) .",
    "in the light of the results presented above we will now discuss our model predictions and offer our interpretation of the open issues listed in ",
    "[ sec : open_issues ] :    * following reorganization of the outer magnetic field and its alignment with the rotation axis , our model naturally predicts the suppression of further radio pulsations .",
    "our model can thus in principle explain why sgrs and axps stop pulsating following their bursting era .",
    "* the high-@xmath10 ( magnetar - strength ) radio pulsars that show no evidence of enhanced x - ray emission , can be accounted for in our model if they are just neutron stars that have not experienced the effect .",
    "as long as the object is a quark star in a superconducting phase , magnetic field decay and reorganization will take effect regardless of the field strength .",
    "we thus predict that sgr - like bursts with moderate - strength magnetic field may be discovered in the future . * if observations do confirm that the progenitors of sgrs are very massive stars ( gaensler et al .",
    "2005 ) this would strengthen our model since massive progenitors are more likely to lead to massive neutron stars , for which it should be easier to reach deconfinement densities in the core following accretion or spin - down . *",
    "the period clustering of observed sgrs and axps can be explained in our model as the time necessary for the parent neutron star to cool down sufficiently to experience a transition to a quark star .",
    "other predictions from our model are :    * the association of the sgr source ( the quark star ) with a parent radio - pulsar . in other words , in at least a few cases ( if beaming is favorable ) a parent radio - pulsar should be detected in the same location in the sky as the sgr before the bursting activity . *",
    "if observations show quiescent emission before and after the burst then this is a subsequent burst in our picture , meaning the sgr will have been a quark star for some time . in this case",
    "the association with a parent neutron star will be less obvious .",
    "* assuming synchrotron dominated emission , we should observe a peak at @xmath70 for a solar mass quark star with a @xmath71 radius . * the total energy in bursts from moderate - strength magnetic field ( @xmath72 ) quark stars would be much weaker according to eq .",
    "[ equ : em2 ] .",
    "we predict burst energy from these stars to be of the order of @xmath73 . *",
    "finally , we note that during the stars phase transition from hadronic to quark matter , its radius changes from @xmath74 - @xmath75 ( ouyed et al .",
    "2002 ) , naturally resulting in a significant increase of the magnetic field at the surface .",
    "therefore , a quark star with a strong magnetic field is not necessarily the result of a parent star with a strong magnetic field .",
    "so , if quark stars undergoing the meissner effect are indeed the cause of sgrs or axps , then stronger field strengths in these objects should be expected .",
    "we presented 3-d simulations of the reorganization of the magnetic field surrounding a newly born quark star .",
    "the reorganization is a consequence of the star entering the cfl phase , confining the interior field to vortices , and leaving the exterior field in its tilted dipole configuration . in our model",
    "the bursting activity in sgrs and axps is explained as magnetic reconnection events occurring while the exterior field aligns itself with the interior one .",
    "one of the obvious consequences of the final state ( aligned rotator ) is the suppression of the radio - emission in sgrs and axps following their bursting era .",
    "we should emphasize that magnetic fields alone can not be responsible for the properties of sgrs and axps , but rather a compact star experiencing the meissner effect is required .",
    "a further consequence is that while a low-@xmath10 quark star entering the `` meissner phase '' would burst in x - ray , this will not necessarily be the case for a high-@xmath10 neutron star .",
    "while quark stars have not yet been observed in nature , our model seems to account for many observed features in sgrs and axps , thus warranting further investigation .",
    "we thank ralph pudritz , chris pethick , and kaya mori for discussions .",
    "b.  n. thanks c.i.t.a . for hospitality , and sigma - xi for its grant - in - aid of research .",
    "the research of r.  o. is supported by grants from the natural science and engineering research council of canada ( nserc ) and alberta ingenuity fund ( aif ) .",
    "consider a strictly vertical magnetic field @xmath76 in a sphere of radius @xmath77 .    since the radial component of @xmath40 must be continuous at the surface ,",
    "the field inside the sphere must be @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the colatitude at the surface , which is related to @xmath80 via @xmath81 with @xmath19 the cylindrical radius . to calculate the magnetic energy inside the sphere , we integrate @xmath82 over @xmath83 , then transform the @xmath19 integral in one over @xmath79 , using eq .",
    "( [ eq - r - theta - s ] ) . after a bit of algebra",
    ", we find the remarkable expression @xmath84",
    "the initial magnetic field represents the phase where the meissner effect has forced the field inside the neutron star to be strictly vertical , but this reorganization has not yet had time to affect the external field .    in order to keep magnetic energy finite , we have to allow for a transition layer between the vertical internal field and the inclined dipolar external field .",
    "we are thus looking for a magnetic field configuration that minimizes total magnetic energy under the following requirements :        to find the minimum energy field satisfying these requirements , we represent the magnetic field through scalar potentials @xmath91 and @xmath42 : @xmath92 both the vertical field and the inclined dipole field do not have a toroidal part @xmath42 , thus we set @xmath93 everywhere . for the poloidal scalar potential @xmath91 , we make the ansatz @xmath94 where @xmath95 are the spherical harmonics of order @xmath96 and degree @xmath97 .",
