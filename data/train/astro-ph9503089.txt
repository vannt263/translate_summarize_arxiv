    "how and when galaxies formed are questions at the forefront of work in observational cosmology .",
    "absorption systems detected in quasar spectra provide the means to study these phenomena up to z@xmath145 , back to when the universe was less than 10% of its present age . while the baryonic content of spiral galaxies that are observed in the present epoch",
    "is concentrated in stars , in the past this must have been in the form of gas",
    ". damped absorption ( dla ) systems have neutral hydrogen column densities of n(hi)@xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "they dominate the baryonic mass contributed by hi .",
    "the principal gaseous component in spirals is hi which has led to surveys for absorption systems detected by the dla they produce ( wolfe , turnshek , smith & cohen 1986 [ wtsc ] ; lanzetta et  al .",
    "1991 [ lwtlmh ] ; lanzetta , wolfe & turnshek 1995 [ lwt95 ] ) .",
    "we extend the earlier work on lyman limit systems and dlas to higher redshifts using observations of qsos from the apm z@xmath04 qso survey ( irwin , mcmahon & hazard 1991 ) , these data more than triple the redshift path surveyed at z@xmath03 and allow the first systematic study up to z=4.5 .",
    "we have obtained 27 high s / n spectra at 5resolution at the william herschel telescope .",
    "the spectra were analyzed starting 3000 km s@xmath18 blueward of z(emission ) .",
    "the analysis was stopped when the s / n ratio became too low to detect a line with w(rest)@xmath195 .",
    "this point was typically caused by the incidence of a lyman limit system .",
    "features with w(observed ) 25  were selected with an automated procedure .",
    "most of these are blends of the dense forest features present at high redshift . the equivalent width and fwhm",
    "were measured interactively and n(hi ) was estimated for features with w or fwhm @xmath030 .",
    "of the 34 measured , 15 have estimated n(hi)@xmath20 @xmath17 covering @xmath12 .",
    "only one candidate has estimated n(hi)@xmath21 @xmath17 .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of 4 candidates has confirmed 3 as damped ( log n(hi)@xmath1920.3 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the survey with redshift was determined using the method developed by lanzetta ( see lwt95 ) .",
    "the function @xmath22 is calculated , giving the number of lines of sight along which a damped system at a redshift @xmath23 could be detected .",
    "figure 1a shows the sensitivity of the apm survey alone and in combination with the wtsc and lwtlmh surveys .",
    "the candidate and confirmed dla systems from the apm sample and previous surveys ( wtsc ; lwtlmh ; lwt95 ) have been combined to study the evolution of the number density per unit redshift for 0.01 @xmath4 z @xmath4 4.7 .",
    "fit with the customary power law @xmath24 , a population with no intrinsic evolution in the product of the absorption cross - section and comoving spatial number density will have @xmath25 ( @xmath6 ) or @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) . a maximum likelihood fit to the data with z@xmath01.5 yields @xmath28 , consistent with no intrinsic evolution even though the value of @xmath10 is similar to that found for the lyman limit systems where evolution is detected at a significant level . however , there is redshift evolution evident in the higher column density systems with an apparent decline in @xmath29 for z@xmath03.5 .",
    "these results are displayed in figure 1(b ) .",
    "the combined data set is plotted as dashed lines with the above fit .",
    "the results for only the absorbers with log n(hi)@xmath30 are shown as solid lines .",
    "the z@xmath41.5 bin is taken from lwt95 .",
    "the mean cosmological mass density contributed by damped absorbers can be estimated as @xmath31 as defined in lwtlmh ( equations 17 - 18 ) , giving the current mass density in units of the current critical density .",
    "the errors in @xmath15 are difficult to estimate because the column density distribution function , @xmath32 , is not known .",
    "lwtlmh utilised the standard error in the distribution of n(hi ) which yields zero error if all the column densities in a bin are the same .",
    "we have estimated the fractional variance in @xmath15 as @xmath33 which yields @xmath34 errors if all the column densities included in a bin are equal .",
    "this method yields larger errors .",
    "the results for @xmath15 are shown in figure 2 for q@xmath35=0 and q@xmath35=0.5 ( h@xmath35=50 ) .",
    "the z@xmath41.5 bin is taken from lwt95 .",
    "the z@xmath01.5 solid bins utilise the data from wtsc , lwtlmh , and the apm survey .",
    "the dotted bins exclude the apm data .",
    "the inclusion of the apm survey data for @xmath11 lowers the value previously found for @xmath36 and indicates a possible turnover for @xmath37 .",
    "the results are also consistent with a relatively constant value of @xmath15 for @xmath38 as the error bars are still very large at high redshift . larger samples of bright @xmath39 quasars are needed .",
    "the qsos from the apm survey more than triple the @xmath11 redshift path for dla surveys .",
    "fourteen candidate dla systems have been identified in the apm spectra covering @xmath12 ( 11 with @xmath13 ) , with 3 confirmed .",
    "combining these data with the previous surveys and fitting a single power law for z@xmath01.5 gives n(z)@xmath40 , marginally consistent with no evolution models .",
    "evolution is evident in the highest column density absorbers with the incidence of systems with log n(hi)@xmath1921 apparently decreasing for z3.5 .",
    "we find evidence for a turnover or flattening in the cosmological mass density of neutral gas , @xmath15 at high redshift .",
    "the more gradual evolution of @xmath15 than previously found helps alleviate the ` cosmic g - dwarf problem ' ( lwt95 ) , i.e. if a large amount of star formation has taken place between z=3.5 and z=2 , a much larger percentage of low metallicity stars should exist than is detected .",
    "it is also consistent with the suggestion by pettini et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) that the wide range in dla metallicities measured at the same epoch indicates that at z@xmath142 they are observed prior to the bulk of star formation in the disk .",
