    "in addition to their intrinsic geometric appeal , the penrose conjecture @xcite and the positive mass theorem @xcite are fundamental tests of general relativity as a physical theory . in physical terms , the positive mass theorem states that the total mass of a spacetime with nonnegative energy density is also nonnegative .",
    "the penrose conjecture , on the other hand , conjectures that the total mass of a spacetime with nonnegative energy density is at least the mass contributed by the black holes in the spacetime . in this section",
    ", we will explain how these simple physical motivations translate into beautiful geometric statements .",
    "after special relativity , einstein sought to explain gravity as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by matter .",
    "in contrast to newtonian physics , gravity is not a force but instead is simply an effect of this curvature . as an analogy ,",
    "consider a heavy bowling ball placed on a bed which causes a significant dimple in the bed . now roll a small golf ball off to one side of the bowling ball .",
    "note that the path of the golf ball curves around the bowling ball because of the curvature of the surface of the bed . in this analogy ,",
    "the bowling ball represents the sun , the golf ball represents the earth , and the surface of the bed represents spacetime . whereas newton explained the curvature of the path of the smaller object by asserting an inverse square law force of attraction between the two objects , einstein declared that the curvature of the smaller object s trajectory was due to the curvature of spacetime itself , and that objects which did not have forces ( other than gravity ) acting upon them followed geodesics in the spacetime . that is , according to general relativity , the sun and all of the planets are actually following geodesics , curves with zero curvature , in the spacetime .",
    "it should also be noted that general relativity is entirely consistent with large scale experiments , whereas newtonian physics is not .",
    "the most notable example may be the precession of the orbit of mercury around the sun . whereas general relativity predicts the rate at which the elliptical orbit precesses around the sun to as many digits as can be measured , newtonian physics is off by almost one percent , with all possible excuses for the discrepancy having been eliminated .",
    "the question , then , is how to turn the beautiful and experimentally verified idea of matter causing curvature of spacetime , which einstein called his happiest thought , into a precise mathematical theory .",
    "first , assume that @xmath0 is a lorentzian manifold , meaning that the metric @xmath1 has signature @xmath2 at each point .",
    "note that at each point , time - like vectors ( vectors @xmath3 with @xmath4 ) are split into two connected components , one of which we will call future directed time - like vectors , and the other of which we will call past directed time - like vectors .",
    "next , define @xmath5 to be the energy density going in the direction of @xmath3 as measured by an observer going in the direction of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are future - directed unit time - like vectors at some point @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , suppose that @xmath9 is linear in both slots so that t is a tensor .",
    "then the physical statement that all observed energy densities are nonnegative translates into @xmath10 for all future - directed ( or both past - directed ) time - like vectors @xmath3 and @xmath6 at all points @xmath8 , known as the dominant energy condition .    the goal , then , is to set @xmath9 , which is called the stress - energy tensor , equal to some curvature tensor .",
    "a natural first idea is to consider the ricci curvature tensor since it is also a covariant 2-tensor .",
    "in fact , this was einstein s first idea .",
    "however , the second bianchi identity on a manifold @xmath11 with metric tensor @xmath1 implies that @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the ricci curvature tensor , and @xmath15 is the scalar curvature .",
    "this geometric identity led einstein to propose @xmath16 known as the einstein equation , since as an added bonus we automatically get a conservation - type property for @xmath9 , namely @xmath17 .",
    "naturally this is a very nice feature of the theory since energy and momentum ( the spatial components of the energy vector ) are conserved in every day experience .",
    "the next step in pursuing this line of thought is to try to find examples of spacetimes which satisfy the dominant energy condition , the simplest case of which would be spacetimes with @xmath18 which are naturally called vacuum spacetimes .",
    "taking the trace implies that such spacetimes ( in 2 + 1 dimensions and higher ) have zero scalar curvature and therefore zero ricci curvature as well .",
    "the first example ( in 3 + 1 dimensions ) is clearly minkowski space @xmath19 which has zero riemann curvature tensor .",
    "the second simplest example of a spacetime with @xmath18 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 , is a one parameter family of spacetimes called the schwarzschild spacetimes . when @xmath22 , these spacetimes represent static black holes in a vacuum spacetime .    while the schwarzschild spacetime can be covered by a single coordinate chart ( see kruskal coordinates described in section [ sec : coe ] ) , the coordinate chart above only covers the exterior region of the black hole and has a coordinate singularity ( not an actual metric singularity ) on the coordinate cylinder @xmath23 . for our purposes , however , we will only be interested in the exterior region of the schwarzschild spacetime , which physically corresponds to the region where observers have yet to pass into the event horizon of the black hole , which is the point of no return from which not even light can escape back out to infinity .",
    "spacetimes which may be expressed in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is a riemannian ( positive definite ) metric on @xmath28 , are called static spacetimes .",
    "this name is appropriate since we see that the components of the spacetime metric in this coordinate chart do not depend on @xmath29 but instead are entirely functions of @xmath30 . note also that static metrics are defined not to have any time / spatial cross terms .",
    "( spacetimes which allow time / spatial cross terms but where the metric components still only depend on @xmath30 are called stationary spacetimes . )    an important result , first proved by bunting and masood - ul - alam @xcite using a very clever argument involving the positive mass theorem , is that the only complete , asymptotically flat _",
    "static vacuum _",
    "spacetimes with black hole boundaries ( or no boundary ) are the two spacetimes that we have listed so far , minkowski and schwarzschild .",
    "this fact suggests that a thorough understanding of these two spacetimes , including what makes them special as compared to generic spacetimes , may be important for understanding some of the most fundamental properties of general relativity .",
    "in fact , the minkowski and schwarzschild spacetimes are the extremal spacetimes for the positive mass theorem and the penrose conjecture , respectively .",
    "that is , the case of equality of the positive mass theorem states that any space - like hypersurface of a spacetime satisfying the hypotheses of the positive mass theorem which has @xmath31 can be isometrically embedded into the minkowski spacetime .",
    "similarly , the case of equality of the penrose conjecture ( which , while still a conjecture , has no known counter - examples in spite of much examination ) states that any space - like hypersurface of a spacetime satisfying the hypotheses of the penrose conjecture which has @xmath32 ( or to be more precise , the region outside of the outermost minimal area enclosure of the apparent horizons ) can be isometrically embedded into the schwarzschild spacetime .    before we can state these theorems , though , we need to define a few terms .",
    "the basic object of interest in this paper is a space - like hypersurface @xmath33 of a spacetime @xmath34 , along with the induced metric @xmath27 on @xmath33 and its second fundamental form @xmath35 in the spacetime .    from this point on",
    "we will assume that @xmath33 has a global future directed unit normal vector @xmath36 in the spacetime .",
    "this standard assumption is not necessary for stating the dominant energy condition or , as we will see in section [ sec : genpen ] , for defining generalized apparent horizons or stating the generalized penrose conjecture , but it is necessary for the traditional definition for apparent horizons of black holes , as we will see .",
    "so for convenience , we will abuse terminology slightly and also call @xmath37 the second fundamental form of @xmath33 , where @xmath38 are any vector fields tangent to @xmath33 and @xmath39 is the levi - civita connection on the spacetime @xmath34 . in this manner",
    "we are defining @xmath35 to be a real - valued symmetric 2-tensor , where the true second fundamental form , which takes values in the normal bundle to @xmath33 , is @xmath40 .",
    "the triple @xmath41 is called the cauchy data of @xmath33 for any positive definite metric @xmath27 and any symmetric 2-tensor @xmath35 .",
    "this name is appropriate because this is the data required to pose initial value problems for p.d.e.s such as the vacuum einstein equation @xmath42 , or the einstein equation coupled with equations which describe how the matter evolves in the spacetime .",
    "note when @xmath33 is flowed at unit speed orthogonally into the future that @xmath43 so that @xmath35 is in fact the first derivative of @xmath27 in the time direction ( up to a factor ) .",
    "curiously , as we will see , the positive mass theorem and the penrose conjecture reduce to and are fundamentally statements about the cauchy data of space - like hypersurfaces of spacetimes , not the spacetimes themselves .",
    "at each point on @xmath33 , define @xmath44 to be the energy density and the covector @xmath45 on @xmath33 to be the momentum density , where @xmath46 , where @xmath3 is any vector tangent to @xmath28 .    by the einstein equation ( equation [ einsteinequation ] ) and the gauss - codazzi identities @xcite",
    ", it follows that @xmath47 and @xmath45 can be computed entirely in terms of the cauchy data @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the scalar curvature of @xmath51 at each point , and the above traces , norms , and divergences are naturally taken with respect to @xmath27 and the levi - civita connection of @xmath27 .",
    "then the dominant energy condition on @xmath9 implies that we must have @xmath52 which we will call the nonnegative energy density condition on @xmath41 , where again the norm is taken with respect to the metric @xmath27 on @xmath33 .",
    "equations [ c1 ] and [ c2 ] are called the constraint equations because they impose constraints on the cauchy data @xmath48 for each initial value problem .",
    "for example , we clearly need to impose @xmath53 and @xmath54 on any cauchy data which is meant to serve as initial conditions for solving the vacuum einstein equation @xmath18 .",
    "however , for our purposes throughout the rest of this paper , we will be interested in cauchy data @xmath48 which only needs to satisfy the nonnegative energy density condition in inequality [ muj ] . since the assumption of nonnegative energy density everywhere is a very common assumption",
    ", the theorems we prove will apply in a very broad set of circumstances .",
    "next we turn our attention to the definition of the total mass of a spacetime . looking back at the schwarzschild spacetime , time - like geodesics ( which represent test particles ) curve in the coordinate chart as if they were accelerating towards the center of the spacetime at a rate asymptotic to @xmath55 in the limit as @xmath56 goes to infinity .",
    "hence , to be compatible with newtonian physics ( with the universal gravitational constant set to 1 ) in the low field limit , we must define @xmath57 to be the total mass of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "more generally , consider any spacetime which is isometric to the schwarzschild spacetime with total mass @xmath57 for @xmath58 and which is any smooth lorentzian metric satisfying the dominant energy condition on the interior region .",
    "of course the schwarzschild spacetime satisfies the dominant energy condition since it has @xmath59 .",
    "then the same argument as in the previous paragraph applies to this spacetime , so its total mass must be @xmath57 as well .",
    "this last example inspires the following definition , which comes from considering the @xmath60 slice of schwarzschild spacetimes .",
    "the cauchy data @xmath48 will be said to be schwarzschild at infinity if @xmath33 can be written as the disjoint union of a compact set @xmath61 and a finite number of regions @xmath62 ( called _ ends _ ) , where @xmath63 on each end and each @xmath64 is isometric to @xmath65 for some @xmath66 and some @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , the mass of the end @xmath62 will be defined to be @xmath66 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for more general definitions of _ asymptotically flat _ cauchy data , but for this paper the special case of being precisely schwarzschild at infinity is sufficiently interesting",
    ".    typically we will be interested in cauchy data with only one end . however , sometimes it is convenient to allow for the possibility of multiple ends .",
    "each end represents what we would normally think of as a spatial slice of a universe , and the positive mass theorem and the penrose conjecture may be applied to each end independently . in fact , since ends can be compactified by adding a point at infinity and then using a very large spherical metric on the end without violating the nonnegative energy density assumption , without loss of generality we may assume that any given cauchy data has only one end for the problems we will be considering .    [ pmt ] ( the positive mass theorem , schoen - yau , 1981 @xcite ; witten , 1981 @xcite ) + suppose that the cauchy data @xmath48 is complete , satisfies the nonnegative energy density condition @xmath68 , and is schwarzschild at infinity with total mass @xmath57",
    ". then @xmath69 and @xmath70 if and only if @xmath48 is the pullback of the cauchy data induced on the image of a space - like embedding of @xmath33 into the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the above theorem has an important special case when @xmath71 which is already extremely interesting .",
    "note that the nonnegative energy condition reduces to simply requiring @xmath51 to have nonnegative scalar curvature .",
    "[ rpmt ] ( the riemannian positive mass theorem , schoen - yau , 1979 @xcite ; witten , 1981 @xcite ) + suppose that the riemannian manifold @xmath51 is complete , has nonnegative scalar curvature , and is schwarzschild at infinity with total mass @xmath57",
    ". then @xmath69 and @xmath70 if and only if @xmath51 is isometric to the flat metric on @xmath72 .",
    "the adjective riemannian was introduced by huisken - ilmanen in @xcite since the theorem is a statement about riemannian manifolds as opposed to cauchy data in the more general case .",
    "we remind the reader that cauchy data @xmath48 is still required to have a positive definite metric @xmath27 .",
    "notice that the riemannian positive mass theorem is a beautiful geometric statement about manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature .",
    "in fact , schoen - yau were studying such manifolds @xcite for purely geometric reasons when they first realized that they could use minimal surface techniques to prove the riemannian positive mass theorem .",
    "they then observed @xcite that theorem [ pmt ] ( which is quite mysterious from a geometric point of view without the physical motivation ) reduced to theorem [ rpmt ] after solving a certain elliptic p.d.e .",
    "on @xmath73 called the jang equation , named after the theoretical physicist who first introduced the equation in @xcite .",
    "witten s proof of the positive mass theorem uses spinors and proves both of the above statements by applying the lichnerowicz - weitzenbock formula to a spinor which solves the dirac equation , and then integrating by parts .",
    "this proof has a strong appeal because it computes the total mass as an integral of a nonnegative integrand .",
    "however , so far it has not been clear how to generalize this approach to achieve the penrose conjecture , although very interesting works in this direction include @xcite and @xcite .",
    "before we can state the penrose conjecture , we need several more definitions . for convenience ,",
    "we modify the topology of @xmath33 by compactifying all of the ends of @xmath33 except for one chosen end by adding the points @xmath74 .",
    "( however , the metric will still not be defined on these new points . )",
    "[ def : cals ] define @xmath75 to be the collection of surfaces which are smooth compact boundaries of open sets @xmath76 in @xmath33 , where @xmath76 contains the points @xmath74 and is bounded in the chosen end .",
    "all of the surfaces that we will be dealing with in this paper will be in @xmath77 .",
    "also , we see that all of the surfaces in @xmath78 divide @xmath33 into two regions , an inside ( the open set ) and an outside ( the complement of the open set ) . thus , the notion of one surface in @xmath77 enclosing another surface in @xmath77 is well defined as meaning that the one open set contains the other .",
    "given any @xmath79 , define @xmath80 to be the outermost minimal area enclosure of @xmath81 .",
    "that is , in the case that there is more than one minimal area enclosure of the surface @xmath81 , choose the outermost one which encloses all of the others .",
    "the fact that an outermost minimal area enclosure exists and is unique roughly follows from the following : if @xmath82 and @xmath83 are both minimal area enclosures of some surface , then so are @xmath84 and @xmath85 since @xmath86 and both have area at least @xmath87 . a rigorous proof that the outermost minimal area enclosure of a surface in an asymptotically flat manifold exists and is unique is given in @xcite .",
    "define @xmath79 in @xmath48 to be an apparent horizon if it is one of the following three types of horizons ,    a future apparent horizon if @xmath88 a past apparent horizon if @xmath89 and a future and past apparent horizon if @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the mean curvature of the surface @xmath81 in @xmath51 ( with the sign chosen to be positive for a round sphere in flat @xmath72 ) and @xmath92 is the trace of k restricted to the surface @xmath81 .",
    "note that equation [ futurepastah ] follows from assuming both equations [ futureah ] and [ pastah ] everywhere on @xmath81 .",
    "also note that @xmath81 is not required to be connected , although from a physical point of view each component of @xmath81 is usually thought of as the apparent horizon of a separate black hole . finally , observe that all three types of horizons are simply minimal surfaces ( surfaces with zero mean curvature ) in the important special case when @xmath63 .",
    "physically , the only relevant apparent horizons for a spacecraft flying around in a spacetime are future apparent horizons , because spacecraft are only concerned about being trapped inside black holes in the future .",
    "mathematically , however , merely changing the choice of global normal vector @xmath36 to @xmath33 in @xmath34 to @xmath93 changes the sign on @xmath35 which causes past apparent horizons to become future apparent horizons , and vice versa .    equations [ futureah ] , [ pastah ] , [ futurepastah ] are actually all conditions on the mean curvature vector of @xmath81 in the spacetime .",
    "note that at each point of @xmath94 , the normal bundle , of which the mean curvature vector is a section , is a 2-dimensional vector space with signature @xmath95 . naturally , a basis for this vector space is any outward future null vector along with any outward past null vector .",
    "since @xmath94 bounds a region in @xmath33 , outward is well - defined , and since there exists a global normal vector @xmath36 to @xmath33 , the future direction is well - defined .",
    "geometrically , if one flows a submanifold in the normal directions @xmath96 , then the rate of change of the area form of the submanifold is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the mean curvature vector .",
    "it turns out that the mean curvature of a surface @xmath94 contained in a slice with cauchy data @xmath48 has coordinates @xmath99 , where the first coordinate is in the unit future normal direction to the slice and the second component is in the unit direction outward perpendicular to the surface and tangent to the slice . with this convention ,",
    "then the vector with components ( 1,1 ) is an outward future null vector , and the vector with components ( -1,1 ) is an outward past null vector .",
    "hence , equation [ futureah ] is equivalent to requiring that , at each point of @xmath81 , the dot product of the mean curvature vector with any outward future null vector is zero ( which implies that the mean curvature vector is a real multiple of the outward future null direction ) .",
    "similarly , equation [ pastah ] is equivalent to saying that the dot product of the mean curvature vector with any outward past null vector is zero .",
    "thus , future apparent horizons have the property that their areas do not change to first order when flowed in outward future null directions .",
    "the same is true for past apparent horizons when flowed in outward past null directions .",
    "we are now able to state the penrose conjecture .",
    "an excellent survey of this conjecture is found in @xcite .",

    "furthermore , equality occurs if and only if @xmath104 is the pullback of the cauchy data induced on the image of a space - like embedding of @xmath105 into the exterior region of a schwarzschild spacetime ( which maps @xmath106 to a future apparent horizon ) .",
    "penrose s heuristic argument for a future apparent horizon in this conjecture is described in more detail in @xcite and @xcite but roughly goes as follows : if , as is generally thought , asymptotically flat spacetimes eventually settle down to a kerr spacetime @xcite , then in the distant future inequality [ pi ] will be satisfied since explicit calculation verifies this fact for kerr spacetimes , where @xmath102 is the area of the event horizon . given that some energy may radiate out to infinity , the total mass of these slices of kerr may be less than the original total mass . also , by the hawking area theorem @xcite ( made more rigorous in @xcite ) , and thus by the cosmic censor conjecture @xcite as well ,",
    "the area of the event horizon is nondecreasing in the spacetime evolution . hence",
    ", this leads us to conjecture inequality [ pi ] in the initial cauchy data slice , but where @xmath102 is the total area of the event horizons of all of the black holes .",
    "the problem , though , is that , unlike apparent horizons , event horizons are not determined by local geometry but instead are defined in terms of which points in spacetime can eventually escape out to infinity along future directed time - like curves .",
    "thus , in principle , there is no way to know which points this includes without looking at the entire evolution of the spacetime into the future .",
    "however , in @xcite penrose argued using the cosmic censor conjecture that future apparent horizons , which are defined in terms of local geometry , must be enclosed by event horizons .",
    "thus , the area of @xmath107 serves as a lower bound for the total area of the event horizons @xcite , @xcite , and the penrose conjecture follows . this same argument , but run in the opposite time direction , yields the same conjecture for past apparent horizons as well .",
    "thus , in the conjecture one could replace `` future apparent horizon '' with simply `` apparent horizon . ''",
    "it is also important to note , as penrose did originally , that a counterexample to the penrose conjecture would be a very serious issue for general relativity since it would imply that some part of the above reasoning is false .",
    "the consensus among many is that the cosmic censor conjecture is the weakest link in the above argument .",
    "if the cosmic censor conjecture turns out to be false , and naked singularities ( singularities not enclosed by the event horizons of black holes ) do develop in generic spacetimes , then this would present a very interesting challenge to general relativity as a physical theory .    however , like the positive mass theorem , setting @xmath71 yields another beautiful geometric statement about manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature , which is known to be true .",

    "then they showed that the hawking mass of the surface is nondecreasing under this flow , equals the right hand side of the riemannian penrose inequality initially , and limits to the left hand side of the riemannian penrose inequality as the surface flows out to large round spheres going to infinity .",
    "both the physicists insight into proposing this idea and the mathematicians cleverness at generalizing the argument to something which could be made rigorous are remarkably beautiful .",
    "bray s proof also involves a flow , but of the riemannian manifold @xmath51 .",
    "the flow of metrics stays inside the conformal class of the original metric and eventually flows to a schwarzschild metric ( shown as the case of equality metric ) .",

    "thus , understanding this system of equations , and whatever existence theory might be associated with it , is a very interesting and important open problem .",
    "a first step is to observe that @xmath454 does not need to be defined in the system .",
    "hence , our system is equivalent to    * the jang - inverse mean curvature flow equations * @xmath459 where we recall that @xmath460 and @xmath330 which can be thought of as three equations and three free functions @xmath142 , @xmath148 , and @xmath143 on the original cauchy data @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , the third equation , equation [ thirdeqn ] , can be used to solve for @xmath143 in terms of @xmath148 , @xmath461 , and @xmath384 .",
    "the purpose of this is to recognize that the jang - imcf equations may also be thought of as two equations and two free functions @xmath142 and @xmath148 once we substitute for @xmath143 .",
    "since only first derivatives of @xmath142 and @xmath148 appear in the expression for @xmath143 below , the resulting equivalent system is two second order equations in @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "unfortunately , the expression for @xmath143 in terms of @xmath142 and @xmath148 on @xmath51 is a bit messy , but at least it is explicit . from equation [ thirdeqn ] ,",
    "we get @xmath462 which is simple enough except that @xmath143 also appears in the expression for @xmath174 .",
    "next we note that @xmath463 which , when combined with equation [ phiphi ] gives us @xmath464 it follows that @xmath152 solves the quadratic equation , @xmath465 where @xmath466 which is clearly always nonnegative ( and where we disregard the negative square root in the quadratic formula since that solution is nonpositive ) .",
    "thus , an equivalent formulation of the jang - imcf equations is @xmath467 where @xmath468 @xmath330 @xmath469 and @xmath470 which can be thought of as two equations and two free functions @xmath142 and @xmath148 on the original cauchy data @xmath48 .",
    "( in equation [ phiformula ] , @xmath471 when @xmath472 by equation [ phiphi ] ) .",
    "we end this section with a general discussion of the some of the challenges involved in finding an existence theory for the jang - imcf equations .",
    "first , note that these equations reduce to the huisken - ilmanen imcf equation on @xmath51 when @xmath473 since then we can choose @xmath474 ( which implies @xmath475 ) to satisfy the generalized jang equation ( equation [ gggjjjeee ] ) .",
    "thus , clearly a notion of a weak solution to this system of equations is required .",
    "furthermore , the notion of  jumps \" must still be involved when there are regions in which @xmath476 .",
    "note that when @xmath476 , then @xmath197 .",
    "thus , if @xmath142 stays smooth and bounded , it would follow that @xmath477 , which means that the generalized jang equation can not be solved unless @xmath478 in this region as well .",
    "if @xmath479 in this region , then this would suggest that @xmath142 needs to be unbounded or undefined in this region .",
    "clearly this is an important issue to understand .    given these and other considerations",
    ", one might be tempted to be pessimistic about finding a general existence theory for the jang - imcf equations .",
    "in fact , it was once the case that most were pessimistic about the original inverse mean curvature flow proposed by geroch @xcite , right up until huisken - ilmanen @xcite found an amazingly beautiful and natural existence theory for a generalized version of inverse mean curvature flow . thus , there is also precedent for optimism .",
    "in this section we comment that there is at least one other einstein - hilbert action method in addition to the jang - imcf equations .",
    "so far we have seen how the penrose conjecture would follow from a general existence theory for the jang - zero divergence equations presented in section [ sec : exist1 ] or , for a single black hole in dimension three , from a general existence theory for the jang - imcf equations presented in section [ sec : jangimcf ] . in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss a third system of equations whose existence theory would also imply the penrose conjecture .",
    "the precise statement of this third system is a bit laborious and so we do not state it here , but only describe it and the additional considerations it involves .    in section [ sec : ehm ] , we explained how any inequality of the form @xmath480 for some @xmath379 , leads to a system of equations which implies the penrose conjecture .",
    "the first equation in the system is the generalized jang equation and the second equation in the system is simply @xmath381 ( times a constant if one likes ) . in section [ sec : jangimcf ]",
    "we pursued this approach in detail for the huisken - ilmanen inverse mean curvature flow .",
    "bray s proof @xcite of the riemannian penrose inequality , when revisited , also yields an inequality of the form of equation [ form2 ] .",
    "this proof of the riemannian penrose inequality involves a conformal flow of metrics ( cfm ) which flows an initial asymptotically flat metric with nonnegative scalar curvature to a schwarzschild metric in the limit as the flow parameter goes to infinity .",
    "furthermore , the area of the horizon stays constant , and ( by the riemannian positive mass theorem it turns out that ) the total mass is nonincreasing during the flow .    to generalize the conformal flow of metrics ( cfm ) proof to get an inequality as in equation [ form2 ] , we first need to generalize the positive mass theorem to get an inequality of the form @xmath481 for some @xmath379 on some @xmath482 .",
    "witten s spinor proof @xcite of the riemannian positive mass theorem provides such a result , for example , at least whenever a spinor solution to the dirac equation exists ( since we are not assuming @xmath483 anymore , there is an issue now ) .",
    "also , a result of this type can be found by multiplying the metric @xmath484 by a conformal factor to achieve zero scalar curvature globally ( when such a factor exists ) , and then measuring how much the mass changes .",
    "this last idea is made precise by jauregui in @xcite .",
    "finally , one can also use inverse mean curvature flow starting from any point to prove an inequality of the above form in equation [ form3 ] .",
    "this third approach currently has the advantage over the first two in that it is known to work in all cases in dimension three by the previous section and the work of huisken and ilmanen @xcite and streets @xcite .    in the conformal flow of metrics @xmath485 with total masses",
    "@xmath486 , @xmath487 hence , @xmath488 since the areas @xmath489 of the horizons of @xmath485 stay constant and the flow of metrics converges to schwarzschild where @xmath490 . then plugging equation [ form3 ] into the above equation and accounting how the scalar curvature transforms conformally gives a result of the desired form in equation [ form2 ] .",
    "hence , modulo the existence questions needed to get an equality of the form of equation [ form3 ] , we get a generalization of the riemannian penrose inequality .",
    "one difference between the jang - cfm equations and the jang - imcf equations , however , is that the jang - cfm equations are not local .",
    "that is , @xmath380 in this case does not satisfy a local p.d.e .  at each point and instead has a more complicated expression . hence , for the jang - cfm equations to have an existence theory , the theory would have to work for a wide range of possible @xmath454 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath380 from the jang - cfm equations has the potential to have better regularity than the @xmath380 from the jang - imcf equations . for the jang - imcf equations , @xmath491 is not necessarily continuous or even positive , and in fact equals zero in jump regions of the inverse mean curvature flow on @xmath185 , which as discussed at the end of the previous section , introduces additional analytical challenges .",
    "the two most interesting and important open problems discussed in this paper are finding an existence theory for the jang - zero divergence equations ( which would prove the penrose conjecture ) and finding an existence theory for the jang - imcf equations ( which would prove the penrose conjecture for a single black hole when @xmath492 ) .",
    "another interesting problem is to find a general existence theory for any einstein - hilbert action method as long as the associated @xmath380 has certain properties .",
    "if the @xmath380 from the jang - cfm equations qualified for such a theory , this would also prove the penrose conjecture .",
    "another interesting problem is to find additional einstein - hilbert action methods by finding new inequalities of the form of equation [ form2 ] .",
    "since the special case of @xmath366 implies the riemannian penrose inequality , one would either have to find a new proof of the riemannian penrose inequality or use the riemannian penrose inequality itself to find such a generalization .",
    "there may be reasonable ideas to try in this latter approach .",
    "there is also the question of the physical interpretation of inequalities of the form of equation [ form2 ] .",
    "rewriting the inequality gives us @xmath493 which could be interpreted as saying that the total mass of a time - symmetric slice of a spacetime ( not necessarily with nonnegative energy density ) is at least equal to the mass contributed by the black holes ( the first term ) plus a weighted integral of the energy density ( the second term ) , since energy density at each point can be interpreted as @xmath494 .",
    "the purpose of @xmath454 can be interpreted as the need to account for potential energy .",
    "also , @xmath454 should go to zero ( and does in the imcf and cfm cases ) at and inside the horizons of the black holes since matter inside black holes should not affect the total mass .",
    "we also believe that the generalized schoen - yau identity and the generalized jang equation have much potential for many possible applications in the study of general relativity .",
    "one point of view , for example , is that the jang - zero divergence equations give a canonical way of embedding cauchy data @xmath48 into a static spacetime . if one is interested in understanding how the initial cauchy data evolves under the vacuum einstein equations , or some other equation coupled with the einstein equation , then one could compute how the canonical static metrics associated with the evolving cauchy data slices evolve .",
    "one nice property of this approach is that if the initial cauchy data is a slice of the schwarzschild spacetime , and we are solving the vacuum einstein equations for example , then while the cauchy data is evolving in what might appear to be complicated ways , the associated canonical static spacetime remains the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "also , since the generalized jang equation blows up on horizons , this method could only be used to study the exterior region of spacetimes outside the apparent horizons of black holes .",
    "there may be some advantages to this restriction if this becomes a natural way to avoid spacetime singularities .",
    "the target audience of these appendices are graduate students and other researchers who are interested in entering geometric relativity as a field to study . as such",
    ", we have included more detail in these calculations than is typical .",
    "we justify this choice in part with the fact that there are so many computations , many people would have a hard time duplicating all of these computations in a reasonable amount of time , even with well chosen hints .",
    "we also hope that these appendices will be useful to students and researchers who are interested in practicing their computational skills .",
    "we recommend the book `` semi - riemannian geometry with applications to relativity '' by barrett oneill as an excellent introduction to the differential geometry of general relativity , and we mostly follow that book s notation here .",
    "readers should go through the calculations in these appendices in order since notational conventions which are established in one appendix apply to the appendices which follow as well .",
    "the authors would like to thank alan parry for helping with the texing and jeff jauregui for helpful comments improving the readability of these appendices .",
