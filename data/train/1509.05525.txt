    "topological insulators are materials that display non - trivial topological order .",
    "they are time - reversal symmetric and , though insulating in the bulk , support protected conducting edge states @xcite .",
    "such phenomenology can be found in group v and group v / vi alloys that display strong enough spin - orbit coupling to induce band inversion , for example @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "initially studied for their unusual electronic properties , topological insulators also display some interesting electromagnetic properties , the most significant of which is the magnetoelectric effect which induces mixing between the electric , @xmath6 , and magnetic induction , @xmath7 , fields @xcite .",
    "this effect causes faraday and kerr rotations of the polarization of transmitted and reflected light , respectively , as well as changes to the brewster angle and goos - hnchen shift @xcite .",
    "previous studies of these effects have looked at the interaction of plane polarized light with single interfaces @xcite or single slabs at normal incidences @xcite and often from a condensed matter perspective .",
    "here we generalize previous results to multiple layers and arbitrary incidence angles using the transfer matrix technique familiar from optical studies of layered media . as an example",
    ", we use this formalism to study an @xmath8 unit cell ( @xmath9-layer ) axionic bragg grating , identify the angular dependence of the faraday and kerr rotations and distinguish the different phenomenology of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 waves .",
    "photonic structures of this type allow precise control over the polarization properties of light and the results and techniques described herein have potential applications in the development of novel optical devices - devices which will be especially useful in situations where polarization control is desired .",
    "the magnetoelectric effect in a topological insulator can be used to realize an axionic material @xcite . in order to do this on must introduce a time - symmetry breaking perturbation of sufficient size to open a gap in the surface states , thereby converting the material from a surface conductor to a full insulator @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing ferromagnetic dopants to the surface @xcite ( 12% dopants will open a @xmath10 mev gap @xcite ) or by the application of an external static magentic field @xcite . in such a situation",
    "the usual constitutive relations become @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fine structure constant and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the dielectric permittivity , magnetic permeability and axion coupling respectively , the latter of which takes even multiples of @xmath16 in a conventional magneto - dielectric and odd multiples of @xmath16 in an axionic material , with the magnitude and sign of the multiple given by the strength and direction of the time symmetry breaking perturbation . here and in the following we use natural units with @xmath17 .    using maxwell s equations , which are unchanged in an axionic material , with the constitutive relations in eqs . and",
    ", one can show that the frequency components of the electric field obey the inhomogeneous helmholtz equation @xmath18 = i\\omega\\mathbf{j}(\\mathbf{r},\\omega ) , \\label{ehelmholtz}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the usual current source .",
    "if the axion coupling is homogeneous , @xmath20 , then the last term on the left - hand side vanishes and one finds that the propagation of the electric field is the same as in a conventional magneto - dielectric . as a result , electromagnetic waves propagating within a homogeneous axionic material retain there usual properties - dispersion is linear , the phase and group velocities are proportional to the usual refractive index , the fields are transverse and orthogonal polarizations do not mix .",
    "thus , the effects of the axion coupling are only felt when the axion coupling varies in space . for layered ,",
    "homogeneous media this will occur only at the interfaces where the properties of the medium change .",
    "matrices compute the right moving , @xmath21 , and left moving , @xmath22 , field amplitudes at the left hand interface in a layer with medium @xmath23 given the right moving , @xmath24 , and left moving , @xmath25 , field amplitudes at the left hand interface in the previous layer with medium @xmath26 . ]",
    "consider a bragg grating , periodic in the @xmath27 direction , with layer thicknesses @xmath28 and @xmath29 and corresponding permittivities @xmath30 and @xmath31 , permeabilities @xmath32 and @xmath33 and axion couplings @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively ( see fig [ bragg ] ) .",
    "light is incident from the left from a waveguide with permittivity @xmath36 , permeability @xmath37 and axion couplings @xmath38 and exits to the right into a waveguide with permittivity @xmath39 , permeability @xmath40 and axion couplings @xmath41 .",
    "we will consider a mode propagating in the forward @xmath27 . as interfaces between axionic materials mix polarization states",
    ", we will use an electric field with a general polarization .",
    "furthermore , as the grating is homogeneous in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 directions we expect the field to be only a function of @xmath27 .",
    "thus the electric field ansatz reads @xmath44 where , @xmath45 labels the unit cell and @xmath46 indicates the medium layer . here , @xmath47 is the wavevector parallel to the interfaces .",
    "note that , owing to the isotropy of the system in the @xmath48 plane , one can always define a coordinate system such that the propagation wavevector lies in the @xmath49 plane .",
    "substituting the expression in eq . into eq . and noting that within each homogeneous region @xmath50 , one finds that the @xmath42 and @xmath43 components of the electric field components obey the usual @xmath51 wave equation @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 the incidence angle of the light with the interface .",
    "the @xmath27 component of the field is related to the @xmath43 component by @xmath57 these equations admit the usual plane - wave solutions @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the amplitudes of the right and left travelling waves , respectively .",
    "furthermore , using maxwell s equations and eq .",
    "one can find the magnetic field @xmath61\\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}\\theta_{\\nu}\\left[a_{y , m,\\nu}e^{ik_{\\nu , x}x } + b_{y , m,\\nu}e^{-ik_{\\nu , x}x}\\right],\\\\ h_{z , m,\\nu}(x,\\omega ) & = \\frac{k_{\\nu , x}}{\\omega\\mu_{\\nu}}\\left[a_{y , m,\\nu}e^{ik_{\\nu , x}x } - b_{y , m,\\nu}e^{-ik_{\\nu , x}x}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}\\theta_{\\nu}\\left[a_{z , m,\\nu}e^{ik_{\\nu , x}x } + b_{z , m,\\nu}e^{-ik_{\\nu , x}x}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the fundamental electromagnetic boundary conditions state that the transverse electric and magnetic fields must be continuous across a boundary . considering the field in unit cell @xmath45 , from the constraints at the @xmath62 and @xmath63 interfaces , the amplitudes of the field at the left interface of each layer , given the amplitude of the field at the left interface of the previous layer , are found to be ( see fig [ bragg ] ) @xmath64 where the transfer matrices @xmath65 read    @xmath66    with @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "in addition to these matrices we have the transfer matrices at the input , @xmath70 , and output , @xmath71 , faces of the grating .",
    "these read @xmath72 and @xmath73    by concatenating these matrices , one can find the field in any layer of a multi - layered system .",
    "thus for an @xmath74 unit cell system , give an input field , the output field is given by @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the reflectivity and the faraday an kerr rotations of the grating can be found by considering @xmath77 where the power of @xmath78 indicates the matrix inverse .",
    "note that @xmath79 as there is no incident flux from the right . from eq .",
    "the output field , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , can be found for any given input field , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , by eliminating @xmath80 and @xmath81 from eq .",
    "it is also possible to find the reflected field @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "although these expressions are lengthy , they are easily computed .",
    "the reflected power for incident @xmath0 and @xmath1 waves is then given by @xmath86 and the faraday and kerr rotation angles by @xmath87,\\\\ \\theta^{te}_{k } = \\arctan\\left[\\frac{b_{z , i}}{b_{y , i}}\\right],\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and @xmath88,\\\\ \\theta^{tm}_{k } = \\arctan\\left[\\frac{b_{y , i}}{b_{z , i}}\\right],\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "as an example , we consider an @xmath8 unit cell ( @xmath9-layer ) bragg grating consisting of alternating layers of @xmath89 and @xmath3 .",
    "we take the thickness of each layer to be equal , hence @xmath90 , ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume the light is incident from , and exits to , a @xmath89 silicon waveguide .",
    "thus , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "( the low frequency permittivity of @xmath3 is large but for high / optical frequencies this lower value is appropriate @xcite ) . in the following",
    "we will assume that magnetic effects are small and hence @xmath94 .",
    "there are two situations to consider .",
    "the first is the parallel configuration where the magnetic perturbation is in the same direction at each interface .",
    "this leads to an increase in the axion coupling in each successive layer .",
    "hence , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 [ see fig .",
    "[ p_ap ] ( a ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "the second is the anti - parallel configuration where the magnetic perturbation is in the opposite direction at each consecutive interface .",
    "this leads to the axion coupling alternating between values in each successive layer . hence , @xmath99 and @xmath100 [ see fig .",
    "[ p_ap ] ( b ) and ( d ) ] .",
    "the above parameters were substituted into the expressions in eqs .",
    "- and the matrix products were then evaluated using computational algebra .       for the @xmath0 ( blue ) and @xmath1 ( red ) polarizations .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines mark the maximum and minimum reflectivity .",
    "the curves are almost identical for both the parallel and anti - parallel configurations . ]",
    "figure [ rp ] shows the reflectivity of the bragg grating as a function of normalized frequency and incidence angle . as the axion coupling is on the order of the fine structure constant , and",
    "hence @xmath101 , the change in reflectivity compared to a non - axionic bragg grating is negligible .",
    "the usual features of bragg gratings are observed , the @xmath0 reflectivity and block band bandwidth increases as the incidence angle increases , whereas the @xmath1 reflectivity decreases as the incidence angle approaches the brewster angle .",
    "this is the case for both the parallel and anti - parallel configurations .",
    "first , we consider a bragg grating in the parallel configuration for varying incidence angles . in this configuration",
    "the change in the axion coupling at each interfaces is always @xmath102 .",
    "transmission at each interface causes a finite rotation .",
    "as the change in axion cupling is the same at each interface , the rotation is always in the same direction [ see fig [ p_ap ] ( a ) ] .",
    "furthermore , a reflected wave will undergo the same rotation as a transmitted wave [ see fig [ p_ap ] ( c ) ] .",
    "hence , both reflected left and right propagating waves will be rotated in the same direction as the transmitted right propagating wave .",
    "thus the rotations at each interface , whether in reflection or transmission , sum and one should observe a non - zero faraday rotation . for increasing incidence angle , the angle that the electric and magnetic fields make with the interface change so one would expect a variation in the faraday rotation .",
    "figure [ tf ] ( a ) shows the faraday rotation for the grating in the parallel configuration .",
    "one sees a non - zero faraday rotation on the order of @xmath103 mrad . since the faraday rotation is the polarization rotation in transmission we first consider frequencies away from the region of high reflectivity . here",
    ", the faraday rotation for the @xmath0 polarization decreases whereas the faraday rotation for the @xmath1 polarization increases with increasing incidence angle .",
    "this phenomenology stems from the magnetic nature of the magnetoelectric effect . for a large rotation the the magnetic field parallel to the interface",
    "needs to be large and the electric field parallel to the interface small . for the @xmath0 polarization , increasing the incidence angle results in a reduction in the transverse magnetic field , where as the transverse electric field is unchanged .",
    "hence , the rotation is reduced .",
    "conversely , for the @xmath1 polarization , increasing the incidence angle results in a reduction in the transverse electric field , where as the transverse magnetic field is unchanged .",
    "hence , the rotation is increased .",
    "this effect is computed more formally in ref .",
    "@xcite .    within the region of high reflectivity",
    "the faraday rotation increases with increasing incidence angle for the @xmath0 polarization and decreases for the @xmath1 polarization .",
    "this is caused by the increased reflectivity of the @xmath0 polarization and the reduced reflectivity of the @xmath1 polarization as the angle increases . for incident @xmath0",
    "light less is transmitted whereas more of the rotated @xmath1 light is transmitted , hence the faraday rotation increases . for incident @xmath1",
    "light more is transmitted whereas less of the rotated @xmath0 light is transmitted , hence the faraday rotation is reduced .",
    "now we consider a bragg grating in the anti - parallel configuration for varying incidence angles . in this configuration",
    "the change in the axion coupling at each interfaces alternates between @xmath102 and @xmath78 .",
    "transmission at alternate interface causes a finite rotation in opposite directions [ see fig [ p_ap ] ( b ) ] .",
    "as before , reflected waves are rotated in the same direction as the transmitted waves [ see fig [ p_ap ] ( d ) ] . thus the rotations at each interface , whether in reflection or transmission , cancel and one should not observe faraday rotation for normal incidence angles . for non - normal angles of incidence , owing to snell s law ,",
    "the angle that the rays make with the interface differ depending on the medium .",
    "thus , the faraday rotations at each interface are different and no longer completely cancel . as a result , and one sees a non - zero faraday rotation    figure [ tf ] ( b ) shows the faraday rotation for the grating in the anti - parallel configuration . for normal incidence angle the faraday rotation vanishes . as the incidence angle increases the faraday rotation for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarizations increase , owing to the non - cancellation of the rotations at each interface . once again , away from the region of high reflectivity we see that the faraday rotation for the @xmath0 wave is less than that of the @xmath1 wave , which is , again , directly related magnitude of the transverse field components .",
    "conversely , and as before , in the region of high reflectivity one sees that the faraday rotation for the @xmath0 wave is greater than that of the @xmath1 wave which is due to the relative reflectivity of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 waves .",
    "again , we first consider a bragg grating in the parallel configuration where the change in the axion coupling at each interfaces is always @xmath102 . as before transmission and reflection results in rotations that sum with the magnitude of the rotation a function of incidence angle .",
    "figure [ tk ] ( a ) shows the kerr rotation for the grating in the parallel configuration.we first consider the kerr rotation in the areas of high reflectivity as this rotation is the polarization in reflection . in these areas , one sees a non - zero kerr rotation on the order of @xmath103 mrad , a magnitude similar to the faraday rotation . however , in contrast to the faraday rotation , the kerr rotation for the @xmath0 polarization decreases with increasing incidence angle whereas the kerr rotation for the @xmath1 polarization increase with increasing incidence angle . as with the faraday rotation ,",
    "this is related to the relative reflectivity of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 waves .",
    "away from the region of high reflectivity , the kerr rotation for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarizations are large , with a full @xmath104 rotation observed for frequencies with vanishing reflectivity .",
    "this is again related to the fact that , at certain frequencies , interference within the grating leads to perfect transmission of the incident light .",
    "however , the light generated by the rotation does not undergo complete destructive interference .",
    "thus , for these frequencies only the rotated light is reflected and , hence , the kerr rotation is maximal .",
    "however , the magnitude of the reflected light at these frequencies is minimal ( @xmath105 of the incident light ) .",
    "finally we consider a bragg grating in the anti - parallel configuration where the change in the axion coupling at each interfaces alternates between @xmath102 and @xmath78 . in this case the transmission and reflection results in rotations that cancel . for light to be reflected from the grating it must be transmitted by an even number of interfaces and reflected from an odd number of interfaces .",
    "thus , the only contribution to the rotation is from the one unpaired reflection .",
    "thus for normal incidences the kerr rotation will exhibit a fixed rotation for all frequencies . for non - normal incidence angles , snell s law will result in a frequency dependence for the kerr rotation .",
    "figure [ tk ] ( b ) shows the kerr rotation for the grating in the anti - parallel configuration . for normal incidence angle",
    "the kerr rotation is constant .",
    "as before , one sees the usual decrease / increase in the kerr rotation for the @xmath0/@xmath1 polarization .",
    "large kerr rotations are again observed in areas of low reflectivity and occur for the reasons give above .",
    "figure [ layers ] ( a ) shows the faraday rotation for the parallel configuration at normal incidence angle for different length gratings ( note that at normal incidence the @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarizations are indistinguishable ) . one sees that , away from the area of maximum reflection , the faraday rotation increases by a fixed amount ( @xmath106 mrad per additional unit cell for the used parameters ) with each additional unit cell . as a faraday rotation occurs at each interface and adding a unit cell adds two new interfaces , this stepwise increase in the faraday rotation with each additional unit cell is expected .",
    "the feature in the frequency dependence of the faraday rotation coincides with the point of maximum reflectivity . since at normal incidence angles",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 polarizations are indistinguishable , this feature is caused by the faraday rotation interaction and not by the relative reflectivity of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the region of high",
    "reflectivity , destructive interference from the multiple reflections within each layer lead to a reduction in transmission .",
    "similarly for the rotated light , the multiple reflections within each layer lead to destructive interference and a drop in transmission .",
    "however , the amplitude of the rotated light with increases every reflection due to the faraday rotation of the incident light at each interface .",
    "hence , the destructive interference effect is greater and the reflectivity of the rotated light is higher . as a result the amplitude of rotated light , compared to incident light , leaving the grating is less than in regions of low reflectivity and hence the faraday rotation is reduced .",
    "figure [ layers ] ( c ) shows the faraday rotation for the parallel configuration at normal incidence angle for different axion coupling difference in neighbouring layers .",
    "one can see that , as the axion coupling difference increases , the faraday rotation increases .",
    "each increase in difference is accompanied by a @xmath107 mrad . since the effect of the axion coupling",
    "is only observed in regions where it changes and is directly linked to the size of the change [ c.f .",
    ", this increase in rotation with increase in axion coupling difference is not surprising .",
    "figure [ layers ] ( b ) and ( d ) show the same results for the kerr rotation and the explanations for the phenomenology mirrors that of the faraday rotation .",
    "though less informative than the faraday rotation , these results are mainly included for completeness .",
    "as the axion coupling is controlled by the strength of the time - symmetry breaking perturbation , one could control the magnitude of the faraday rotation by changing the external magnetic field used to generate the perturbation .",
    "thus one could conceive of a device where the polarization of incident light can be controlled by a time varying magnetic field . a similar effect",
    "is found in gyromagnetic materials and is used in optical isolators and optical rotators .",
    "the amplitude of the faraday rotation in these materials is characterized by the verdet constant , which is a strong function of frequency .",
    "thus , such optical components have a narrow active bandwidth .",
    "axionic materials do not have a strong frequency dependence and hence the effect has a much larger active bandwidth and hence would be beneficial in situations where broad bandwidth fields need to be manipulated .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the axion coupling is stronger . for light at @xmath108 nm , the @xmath8 unit cell bragg grating",
    "considered above has a length of @xmath109 @xmath110 m and generates a faraday rotation of @xmath103 mrad . in comparison ,",
    "a terbium gallium garnet has a verdet constant of @xmath111 rad / tm at @xmath108 nm @xcite .",
    "hence , a similar sized device would require a magnetic field of @xmath112 t to achieve a similar rotation or , conversely , a more manageable magnetic field of @xmath113 t would require the device to be @xmath114 times bigger .",
    "thus , axionic bragg gratings have the potential to be the basis for compact , broadband polarization control optical devices .",
    "here we have presented a comprehensive study of axionic bragg gratings which can be realized by a layered topological insulator subject to a time - symmetry breaking perturbation , such as an external magnetic field or surface magnetic impurities . using the transfer matrix formalism",
    ", we have studied the optical properties of this structure and , as an example , we computed the optical properties of a @xmath8 unit cell ( @xmath9 layer ) bragg grating in both the parallel and anti - parallel configurations .",
    "although the reflective properties of the grating are only negligibly changed by the axionic material , the grating induces faraday rotation in the transmitted light , which for the case studied is on the order @xmath103 mrad .",
    "this rotation angle has a complex angular dependence .",
    "away from the region of high reflectivity the faraday rotation of @xmath0 polarization decreases with increasing incidence angle and the faraday rotation of the @xmath1 polarization increases with increasing incidence angle .",
    "this effect is linked to the change in transverse field components of the @xmath0/@xmath1 polarizations with increasing incidence angle .",
    "conversely , in the region of high reflectivity the faraday rotation of @xmath0 polarization increases with increasing incidence angle and the faraday rotation of the @xmath1 polarization decreases with increasing incidence angle .",
    "this effect is linked to the decreasing / increasing reflectivity of the @xmath0/@xmath1 polarizations with increasing incidence angle .",
    "compared to existing gyromagnetic materials the faraday rotation induced by an axionic bragg grating is larger and has a broader bandwidth and hence could be the basis of many compact , broadband polarization control devices .",
