    "the deflection by the lorentz force ",
    "responsible for the hall effect  occurs also at the nanoscale and imprints classical features on the quantum transport phenomena .",
    "the action of the lorentz force was early detected in mesoscopic cross junctions @xcite .",
    "cyclotron deflection of the electron trajectory was predicted for the coherent ballistic electron injection through a quantum point contact ( qpc)@xcite . this deflection was later observed @xcite by spatially resolved scanning gate microscopy @xcite .",
    "semiclassical electron orbits @xcite are observed in magnetic focusing experiments @xcite which detect peaks of conductance ( @xmath2 ) between two qpcs for @xmath1 values which make the distance between the contacts equal to an integer multiple of the cyclotron diameter .",
    "a theoretical description of the magnetic injection in a t - shaped and wedge junctions was given in ref . @xcite .",
    "recently , magnetic deflection in multiterminal quantum billiards was also studied @xcite . for open",
    "quantum rings the classical deflection of the electron trajectories by the lorentz force competes with quantum interference effects @xcite , which are strong provided that the electron wave function passes with equal amplitude through both the arms of the ring .",
    "the preferential electron injection to one of the arms of the quantum ring by the lorentz force reduces the visibility of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) conductance oscillations in high @xmath1 @xcite . since low visibility of the ab oscillations",
    "may also result from decoherence , a conclusive experiment on the lorentz force effect was proposed for a three - terminal quantum ring @xcite . according to the calculations @xcite the vanishing ab conductance oscillation at high @xmath1 should be accompanied by an imbalance of the electron transport probability to the left and right output leads .",
    "this behavior was indeed observed in subsequent conductance measurements @xcite for a three terminal quantum ring .    the theoretical description of the lorentz force for quantum rings @xcite and the experiment @xcite studied the transport in the lowest subband of the transverse quantization .",
    "however most of the experiments on the ab effects in quantum rings @xcite correspond to multisubband transport .",
    "wave packet dynamics in the second subband was described in ref .",
    "@xcite which however considered a single - output - lead system very narrow channels in which the lorentz force effects are negligible . the purpose of the present paper is to describe the effects of the lorentz force in three terminal system when the stationary current flow at the fermi level goes through several subbands .",
    "a basic motivation for this study are the properties of the asymptotic states within the channels ( see below ) .",
    "the charge density of the first subband is shifted to this edge of the channel which is preferred by the lorentz force . however , the charge density shift in the second subband is just opposite",
    ". therefore , the lorentz force effect in the multiband transport needs to be clarified .",
    "below , we solve the scattering problem for several three - terminal systems using the wave function picture @xcite of the current flow and evaluate the linear conductance in the landauer - bttiker approach @xcite .",
    "we discuss systems with a few types of junctions . for quantum rings we analyze the fourier transform of the transfer probabilities searching for the peaks due to the ab effect and",
    "indicate that the the lorentz force deflection leaves its signature in the low - frequency part of the transform .",
    "we discuss the role of the width of the channels and the type of the junctions that allow the classical lorentz force and the ab oscillations to co - exist .",

    "the scattering problem can then be solved using a two - dimensional model , which we apply below . in order to set the boundary conditions we need first to solve the hamiltonian eigenequation in each of the leads . for the lorentz gauge @xmath10 ,",
    "the electron eigenfunctions in the leads are separable into products of a transverse ( @xmath11 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath12 ) wave functions @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the wave vector of @xmath5-th subband .",

    "the term of the hamiltonian which is responsible for the shifts is linear in @xmath21 . since @xmath22 the shift of the second subband wave function with @xmath20 to the right is weaker than the shift of the lowest subband function with @xmath23 to the left .",
    "the shift of the third subband density is less pronounced due to a still lower value of @xmath24 .    for the electron incident from the input lead of the subband",
    "@xmath5 the wave function in the lower lead far away from the scattering region  outside the range of the evanescent @xcite modes  has the form @xmath25 where the sum goes over all subbands into which the electron may be backscattered . in the left and right",

    "the solution employs the finite difference approach .",
    "the discretization of the equations and the self - consistent procedure for determination of the backscattered ( @xmath27 ) and transferred ( @xmath28 ) amplitudes is given in detail in ref .",
    "the finite difference solution naturally accounts for both appearance of evanescent modes in the fermi level wave function within the scattering region as well as for multisubband scattering .    the electron transfer probability from subband @xmath5 of the input channel to the subband @xmath29 of the output lead is then given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 s are the fluxes of the probability density currents integrated across the channels for the asymptotic hamiltonian eigenstates . in this paper",

    "the electron tends to pass to the left output channel , an overall slope of @xmath38 increases with the number of occupied subbands .",
    "the transfer probabilities for the quantum ring built in a similar manner [ output channels and the ring wider than the input lead  fig .",
    "3(a ) ] are shown in fig . 3 ( b , d , f ) for one , two and three subbands appearing at the fermi level .",
    "the transfer and backscattering probabilities for the ring additionally contain a rapid oscillation which is due to the interference effects for the electron transfer amplitudes going through the left and right arms of the ring .",
    "however , the results  positions of the rapid oscillation features  do not exhibit any evident periodicity which is usually taken as the proof of the aharonov - bohm effect for the coherent current flow .",
    "we performed the fourier analysis of the transfer probability to the one of the output leads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the average transfer probability within the considered @xmath1 range .",
    "the results for @xmath41 for the lowest subband transport are displayed in fig .",
    "the upper and lower panels of fig .",
    "3(c ) display low and high frequency ranges , respectively .",
    "the low frequency part describes mostly the deviation of @xmath38 off its average value which is strong when the lorentz force governs the electron flow .",
    "the high frequency parts of the plot cover the region where the peaks due to the ab oscillation should be expected to appear .    for the system of fig .",
    "3 the fourier transform is entirely dominated by the low frequency part which results from the distinct growth of @xmath42 from 0 to 1 within the studied range of @xmath1 .",

    "the higher frequency part visible only under a close zoom displays a peak near @xmath44 t , which corresponds to the magnetic field period of 0.125 t , which in turn would correspond to the ab period for a ring of radius 102 nm ",
    "somewhat smaller than the mean radius of the ring of 120 nm [ see fig .",
    "3(a ) ] . for @xmath45 t , the @xmath0 oscillations that are due to the quantum interference eventually disappear [ fig .",

    "3(d ) and ( f ) we can see that for two and three subbands at the fermi level the oscillations of the transfer probabilities pertain up to higher values of @xmath1 .",

    "allows the lorentz force to dominate the current flow .",
    "the increased width of the channels leaves the space for magnetic deflection of their trajectories . on the other hand ,",
    "a part of lateral spatial quantization energy for the electron that enters the structure from the thinner input lead to the wider channels is transformed to the kinetic energy of progressive motion which enhances the elastic and intersubband scattering effects .",
    "thus the system starts to resemble a cavity rather than a one - dimensional ring and the former is notorious for its chaotic transport properties .",

    ". in consequence the overall growth of @xmath42 summed over the subbands from -1.2 t to + 1.2 t only weakly depends on the number of subbands participating in the transport  in contrast to the system studied in the precedent subsection . moreover , in fig .",
    "3(b , c ) and ( d ) only @xmath51 probability is a monotonic function of the external magnetic field . for the second subband only at higher @xmath1 the lorentz force deflection of the trajectory wins with the shifts of the asymptotic channel wave function that occur due to the orthogonality conditions [ fig .",
