    "there is at present considerable analytic understanding of how conformal matter with central charge ( @xmath2 ) less than or equal to one couples to two - dimensional gravity @xcite .",
    "these @xmath3 models are relevant both as non - critical string theories and as novel statistical mechanical systems describing matter on a dynamical substrate lattice .",
    "the relation of these models to quantum liouville theory @xcite allows one to compute the shift in the scaling dimension of physical operators due to the coupling to 2d - gravity .",
    "this shift is determined solely by the scaling dimension of the operator in the absence of gravity ( i.e on a fixed lattice ) and the central charge of the theory . given the dressed scaling dimensions one can compute critical exponents of thermodynamic observables related to correlation functions .",
    "through the mapping of these systems onto matrix models it is even possible to incorporate topology change by performing the entire sum over topologies in the so - called double - scaling limit .",
    "this beautiful state of affairs falls apart for central charge exceeding one , where @xmath4 is the conformal weight of the lowest - weight state in the theory @xcite . ] . in this case",
    "the methods of liouville theory appear to fail - in particular they predict complex critical exponents .",
    "the vanishing of the mass of the dressed identity operator ( the tachyon ) at @xmath0 suggests the onset of an instability in the worldsheet geometry .",
    "based on this , it is widely believed that @xmath5 no longer describes a continuum theory of surfaces @xcite . since no models have been solved in this regime , it would be valuable to apply numerical techniques to see if @xmath5 models appear to be qualitatively different than those with @xmath6 .",
    "a simple class of models to test our understanding of these issues is provided by multiple copies of the ising model on a dynamical lattice .",
    "each ising model has @xmath7 .",
    "a model with @xmath8 individual copies then has @xmath9 . for a single ising model ( @xmath10 ) on a dynamical lattice",
    "the critical exponents may be computed analytically via a mapping of the model onto a particular 2-matrix model ( with one matrix representing spin up and the other spin down ) @xcite .",
    "the model has a third order rather than a second order phase transition . without the coupling to gravity the partition function of the @xmath8-ising model",
    "would simply be the @xmath8th power of the single ising model partition function , since the spins of different copies are independent .",
    "the interaction with gravity , however , induces an effective interaction between spins of different species ( copies ) .",
    "spins of different species effectively interact through the dynamical lattice .",
    "brzin and hikami @xcite have studied an equivalent @xmath11-matrix model realization of this system in perturbation theory in the cosmological constant , without any apparent anomaly setting in at @xmath0 .",
    "similarly monte - carlo studies of multiple  ising and multiple  potts models on dynamically - triangulated random surfaces ( dtrs ) do not uncover dramatic changes as @xmath2 passes through one @xcite .    on the numerical side",
    "it is important that we understand the transition case @xmath12 before plunging into the regime @xmath13 .",
    "this is the motivation for the work presented in this paper on large - scale dtrs simulations of the @xmath10 and @xmath14 ising model coupled to 2d - gravity . in the @xmath14 case the formalism of kpz allows a computation of the relevant critical exponents , which we can consequently compare to the numerical results extracted from finite - size scaling and direct fits .",
    "the exact solution of the single - ising model also provides a direct check that the discrete dtrs algorithm is reproducing continuum behavior for the lattice sizes simulated and that the numerical analysis methods employed are adequate . the @xmath14",
    "( @xmath0 ) case is considerably more complicated than the @xmath10 case because of logarithmic violations of scaling . here",
    "the extensive work on @xmath0 matrix models provides an essential clue @xcite .",
    "it allows us to identify the appropriate scaling variable that replaces the cosmological constant . with this in hand",
    "we are able to compare the results of our large - scale dtrs monte - carlo simulations with the predictions of kpz .",
    "similar issues are also addressed in a companion paper @xcite in which percolation coupled to gravity with @xmath15 and @xmath16 matter is examined in much detail . the nature of finite size effects in simulations of two dimensional gravity plays a central role in that paper , as it does here .",
    "we shall show how the percolation results for gaussian matter in @xcite are consistent with those obtained in the two species ising model discussed here .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a theoretical discussion of @xmath0 conformal matter coupled to 2d - gravity , with a derivation of the critical exponents we will be comparing with our numerical simulations and a discussion of logarithmic violations of scaling . in section 3 we present our numerical methods and results including a comparison with theoretical expectations .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we conclude with a discussion of the origin of logarithmic corrections to scaling and the prospects for extending this work to the regime @xmath16 that this implies .",
    "we shall consider a model in which ising spins are attached to the vertices of triangulations .",
    "the triangulations are characterized by their adjacency matrix @xmath17 which equals @xmath18 if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are neighbors and vanishes otherwise .",
    "@xmath17 is the discrete analogue of the worldsheet metric @xmath21 .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the set of triangulations with @xmath22 vertices @xmath23 containing only loops of length @xmath24 or greater and vertices of coordination number of at least @xmath24 .",

    ", we can also predict the value of @xmath46 .",

    "we shall also measure scaling properties of the fortuin - kasteleyn ( fk ) clusters @xcite which we construct to update the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the fk clusters appear in the reformulation of the ising model as a correlated spin  bond percolation model with partition function @xcite @xmath55 colorings consist of a set of ` black ' bonds drawn between adjacent points with identical spin values ; each black bond is drawn with probability @xmath56 . in ( [ corrperc ] )",
    "@xmath57 bonds out of a possible @xmath58 bonds of the lattice are colored black .",
    "fk clusters comprise sets of sites linked together by black bonds . therefore each cluster",

    ", it follows that the spin ",
    "susceptibility equals the mean cluster size @xmath64 , in which averages are taken over the distribution @xmath65 , the mean number of clusters per configuration containing @xmath66 sites .",
    "we thus shall determine the scaling of the mean cluster size and in addition , the fractal dimension @xmath67 of the largest cluster .",
    "the average maximal size cluster @xmath68 of each configuration scales as @xmath69 standard scaling arguments @xcite relate @xmath70 .",
    "one can derive this , for instance , by considering the asymptotic form of @xmath71 .",
    "the standard hyperscaling relation @xmath72 is then needed .",
    "the singularity of the cluster number density , the zeroth moment of @xmath65 , as a function of @xmath73 , is given by the exponent @xmath74 .",
    "similarly the second moment of @xmath65 scales as @xmath75 .",
    "thus the usual scaling assumptions imply @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath68 asymptotically obeys @xmath77 ( that is , the mean number of clusters per configuration of size greater than @xmath68 is of order unity ) and hence @xmath78 . eliminating @xmath79",

    "we can also obtain additional information about the critical geometry of these theories by examining the properties of pure percolation clusters .",
    "consider the bond - percolation model @xmath82 which for @xmath83 is yet another formulation of the ising partition function and more generally is the partition function of the @xmath84-state potts model .",
    "the pair - connectedness function then exhibits the scaling behavior at criticality of ( [ spinscale ] ) with weights @xcite @xmath85 the @xmath86 limit corresponds to pure percolation , which has no dynamics ( and vanishing central charge ) and thus does not induce any back - reaction when it is coupled to a theory of gravity and matter of central charge @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath87 ; the dressed weight is again governed by the kpz formula ( [ kpzmsz ] ) . with this new dressed weight",
    ", we can then predict the scaling behavior of the mean ( and maximal ) cluster sizes @xmath88 ( and @xmath89 ) using ( [ meanszscal ] ) with @xmath90 substituted for @xmath91 .    in our simulations",
    ", we shall consider site percolation , in which sites ( rather than bonds ) are colored black with probability @xmath92 and clusters are built by connecting adjacent colored sites .",
    "it is well known that bond and site percolation are in the same universality class , so that the scaling predictions described above should still hold in the case of pure site percolation .",
    "it is advantageous to consider site percolation because the critical value of @xmath92 , @xmath93 , is constrained to equal @xmath94 for site - percolation on triangulations @xcite .",
    "the scaling relations become more complicated for @xmath0 .",
    "analytic solutions of the @xmath0 matrix models ( and a careful analysis of liouville theory ) show that correlation functions no longer scale simply as powers of the cosmological constant @xmath29 . instead , the appropriate scaling variable is @xmath95 which satisfies . ]",
    "@xmath96 in the limit of small @xmath95 ; @xmath97 is a constant that we do not specify and shall not assume to be universal .",
    "this scaling relation has been derived for the gaussian theory ( of finite and infinite radius ) coupled to gravity .",
    "the product of ising models lies on the gaussian @xmath0 orbifold line @xcite ; coupled to gravity , it is not equivalent to the solved matrix models .",
    "we shall assume that the asymptotic logarithmic scaling violation is characteristic of @xmath0 and thus holds in the two - species case .",
    "then we conjecture that the scaling relation ( [ suscmusca ] ) should be modified so that at @xmath0 has been previously discussed in reference @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath98 in the case of pure percolation , the pair - connectedness function should be substituted for the spin ",
    "spin correlation function , and the dressed ising weight @xmath99 should be replaced by @xmath100 . in the following formulae , @xmath91 and the mean cluster size @xmath90 are interchangeable .",
    "our simulations will be done on worldsheets of toroidal topology ( @xmath101 ) for which @xmath102 for @xmath0 ( for those models that have been solved analytically , so again we are making an assumption about universality ) . to extract the asymptotic scaling behavior of @xmath103 , we invert the relation between @xmath95 and @xmath29 order by order in @xmath104 and @xmath105 to obtain @xmath106",
    "we then expand the inverse laplace transform of ( [ suscetasca ] ) to obtain @xmath107 @xmath108 ( or @xmath109 for pure site percolation ) and @xmath110 is the digamma function .",
    "the scaling behavior of @xmath111 is obtained by inverse laplace transforming @xmath112 : @xmath113 in addition to the higher order terms that we have dropped from the inversion , there are additional corrections to the above formulae .",
    "the correction that depends on @xmath97 in ( [ logscaling ] ) , which we neglect , should lead to contributions to ( [ susczn ] ) and ( [ partc1 ] ) that are competitive with the smallest corrections that we have included above .",
    "in addition , there should be the usual corrections to the scaling ( [ suscetasca ] ) , but these will be suppressed by powers of @xmath114 and are negligible for moderately large @xmath22 .",
    "the difference in the theoretically predicted scaling behavior of percolation clusters at @xmath0 , compared to @xmath115 , illustrates the sensitivity of the worldsheet geometry to the presence of the ising spins .",
    "this should induce an effective coupling between species , which we should be able to detect through correlations between different species observables . to look for this coupling , we shall measure @xmath116 and @xmath117 with @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "a nonzero effective coupling between species should then be manifest through the quantities @xmath120tr @xmath121 and @xmath122tr @xmath123 , which vanish when @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) are uncorrelated and are @xmath18 or @xmath37 when they are respectively perfectly correlated or anti - correlated .",

    "runs were performed on lattices of toroidal topology of size @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "each sweep consisted of @xmath128 flips of randomly chosen links followed by a swendsen - wang update of the spins . to perform the percolation measurements the sites on the lattice were then randomly colored and percolation clusters constructed .",

    "our numerical estimate of the critical value of @xmath137 is therefore somewhat high .",
    "one could also envision locating the critical temperature by looking for a minimum of the mean pure percolation cluster size as a function of @xmath137 .",
    "the growth in the mean cluster size is determined by the exponent @xmath140 , which decreases with @xmath2 .",

    "we observed that measuring the mean - size of fk clusters ( at @xmath165 ) always yielded exponents agreeing with those extracted from the spin  susceptibility .",
    "since the cluster data did not histogram reliably , it was difficult though to estimate the corresponding exponents throughout the above range of @xmath137 without taking a large amount of additional data .",
    "fk cluster scaling was primarily measured just to verify that it agreed with the scaling of the spin  susceptibility .",
    "our data already showed this , so it did not seem worthwhile to repeat runs to measure the cluster scaling at various temperatures .",
    "the following rows thus summarize data for pure percolation clusters , which was relatively insensitive to @xmath137 ; i.e. a shift of @xmath137 of @xmath166 did not induce a stastically significant change in the @xmath153 exponents . since again percolation cluster data did not histogram reliably , we present data taken at @xmath165 in table  [ c1estexp ] ; these should be representative of the values one would measure throughout the region @xmath167 $ ] .",
    "the final two rows include exponents extracted from simulations of a gaussian field @xmath168 coupled to gravity , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "what is most striking about the measured @xmath0 exponents is in fact that they agree quite well with the @xmath115 data ( taken from the numerically estimated range of @xmath132 ) and in the case of percolation , the @xmath169 theoretical predictions .",
    "there is clearly , however , a very large discrepancy between the measured and theoretical @xmath0 scaling exponents . on the larger lattices , the percolation exponents for the two species ising model also agree fairly well with those measured in the gaussian field simulations , suggesting some degree of universality at @xmath0 in their behavior . from equations ( [ susczn ] ) and ( [ partc1 ] )",

    "this suggests the likelihood that at least the leading logarithmic corrections to scaling ( [ leadcorr ] ) are correct and universal for @xmath0 .",
    "we should note here that although the data can be fit by including the above logarithmic corrections it would not be possible to extract these corrections from the data itself without theoretical guidance .",
    "as in the one species case , we also fitted our lowest @xmath137 data points to @xmath175 .",
    "the fit yielded @xmath176 which does not match the theoretical value of @xmath177 .",
    "it is not clear that this fit is reliable ; probably the exact relation between @xmath91 and @xmath137 should also include logarithmic corrections .",
    "we finally turn to an examination of correlations ( defined in ( [ magcorr ] ) and ( [ enecorr ] ) ) between the different spin species .",

    "the correlations are not so strong , indicating that the ising spins are only weakly coupling to gravity for the lattice sizes we consider .",
    "to gauge our prospects for extending this work to @xmath13 , we shall now attempt to shed more light on the origin of the corrections to scaling at @xmath0 . the dynamics at @xmath0",
    "is governed by the tachyon ( the lowest mass operator ) which acquires a continuous spectrum with vanishing energy at @xmath63 momentum .",
    "the scaling corrections arise from the infrared cutoff on the tachyonic momentum , @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "the origin of this logarithmic cutoff may not be so evident in the context of the two - species ising model , since the tachyon can not be expressed so simply in terms of the ising spins .",
    "the presence of logarithmic corrections appears to only depend on the value of the central charge , so we appeal to universality and consider instead the @xmath0 gaussian theory .",
    "the tachyon can then be written in terms of the gaussian field @xmath168 as @xmath180 @xmath181 is the liouville field and @xmath182 is the reference metric ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "the infrared target space momentum cutoff is then just a consequence of the infinite hausdorff dimension of the embedding space @xcite , @xmath184 the suppression of tachyon propagation by finite - size effects effectively weakens the coupling between gravity and the ising spins .",
    "therefore , the spins of each species are only very weakly coupled , and the two and one species models appear to be qualitatively very similar on the lattices we consider .",
    "this should not be true in the continuum limit .",
    "we see that without an understanding of the corrections to scaling for @xmath0 , the numerical observations seem to conflict with our theoretical expectations of the onset of strong coupling at @xmath0 .",
    "the target space hausdorff dimension , as measured for gaussian embeddings of @xmath185 somewhat greater than @xmath18 , is also large .",
    "thus we would expect that for @xmath13 , the tachyon ground state energy still acquires a considerable shift and we expect large corrections to scaling . at @xmath0",
    ", we were able to determine these corrections because the @xmath0 model is solvable . without new theoretical input , the prognosis for understanding simulations for @xmath2 somewhat greater than @xmath18 thus seems poor .",
