    "over the last few years the number of planetary nebulae ( pne ) known to have a binary central star has increased dramatically ( miszalski et al .",
    "2009a , 2011a ; jones 2015 ) .",
    "most of these have orbital periods of 0.11.0 d , meaning they have passed through the poorly understood common - envelope ( ce ) phase ( ivanova et al .",
    "post - ce pne are the youngest post - ce population ( @xmath310@xmath4 yr ) and are therefore a key strategic population with which to study the ce interaction ( e.g. boffin & miszalski 2011 ; tocknell et al .",
    "2014 ; jones 2015 ) . the vast majority of post - ce central stars of pne ( cspne ) have white dwarf",
    "( wd ) primaries with main sequence ( ms ) secondaries , but double wd ( double degenerate , dd ) systems are also common .",
    "boffin et al .",
    "( 2012 ) demonstrated the importance of radial velocity ( rv ) monitoring to discover dd systems in which there is no sign of a binary in optical lightcurves .",
    "there is therefore a potentially large population of pne with evolved wd companions whose binaries can not be found via photometric monitoring .",
    "we have commenced an rv monitoring survey of one such population ( manick et al .",
    "these are the wolf - rayet cspne that appear in over 100 pne ( see todt & hamann 2015 for a review ) , low - mass analogues of massive wr stars ( denoted [ wr ] stars ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to identify post - ce binaries with one component being a [ wr ] star to improve our understanding of the origin of [ wr ] stars .",
    "no such systematic rv monitoring of [ wr ] cspne has been made in the past , perhaps because of concerns that the strong winds would dilute any binary signature . despite the apparent hurdles involved , we were grateful to have had the encouragement of olivier chesneau to pursue this project during his visit to cape town in early 2013 .",
    "rv monitoring and in particular , the cross - correlation technique , is a successful and routine means to find massive wr binaries ( e.g. foellmi et al .",
    "we are applying the same methodology as foellmi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to high quality multi - epoch spectra ( 2   resolution and signal - to - noise @xmath5 40 in the continuum ) .    while the atmospheric composition of most [ wr ] stars belonging to the carbon sequence ( [ wc ] types ) can be readily explained ( werner & herwig 2006 ; todt & hamann 2015 ) , those of the nitrogen sequence ( [ wn ] types ) can not .",
    "their extremely he - rich atmospheres ( @xmath590% by mass , see miszalski et al .",
    "2012a and todt et al .",
    "2013 ) suggests that [ wn ] stars may form via more peculiar channels , e.g. a binary merger ( miszalski et al .",
    "several other binary formation scenarios have also been proposed for [ wr ] stars ( e.g. de marco & soker 2002 ) . identifying post - ce [ wr ] binaries will not only provide distance - independent stellar parameters of [ wr ] stars , but will also help determine whether such binary scenarios can feasibly explain [ wr ] stars .    at present",
    "only two post - ce [ wr ] binaries are known out of nearly 50 post - ce pne ( jones 2015 ) .",
    "hajduk et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found periodic photometric variability in the [ wc7 ] nucleus of pn  g222.8@xmath004.2 with an orbital period of 0.63 or 1.26 d ( the latter is the correct period , see miszalski et al .",
    "manick et al .",
    "( 2015 ) used the southern african large telescope to discover a 4.04 d periodic variability in the [ wo1 ] nucleus of ngc  5189 .",
    "miszalski et al .",
    "( 2015 ) presented an updated rv curve for ngc  5189 with a revised 4.05 d orbital period .",
    "some other [ wr ] cspne monitored by manick et al .",
    "( 2015 ) were not found to be variable and several more objects are also being monitored in this ongoing project ( see also miszalski et al .",
    "the mass functions derived from the rv curves suggest an evolved wd companion for ngc  5189 ( @xmath6 @xmath7 ) and perhaps a subdwarf o / b - type companion for pn  g222.8@xmath004.2 ( @xmath8 @xmath7 ) .",
    "further work is required to constrain the orbital inclination of both systems .",
    "the nebular morphology of ngc  5189 ( sabin et al .",
    "2012 ) is typical of post - ce pne with a high degree of low - ionisation filaments and collimated outflows ( miszalski et al .",
    "it bears particular resemblance to the post - ce pn ngc  6326 ( miszalski et al .",
    "the 4.05 d orbital period is unusually long for a post - ce binary and suggests that post - ce [ wr ] binaries may need longer orbital periods to accommodate the extended atmosphere of the [ wr ] component .",
    "the lack of strong irradiation effects in several [ wr ] and other h - deficient cspne ( ciardullo & bond 1996 ; gonzlez prez et al . 2006 ) , combined with the wd nature of the companion in ngc  5189 , suggests other [ wr ] cspne may also have wd companions that can only be found via rv monitoring .",
    "much less is known about binary cspne at wider orbital separations ( several months to years ) .",
    "van winckel et al . ( 2014 ) presented the first rv observations for wide cspne , namely a 1105 d orbital period in pn g052.7@xmath950.7 and a very long orbital period in lotr  5 .",
    "the latter is one of four barium cspne in which an s - process and/or carbon - enhanced red giant secondary dominates at optical wavelengths , while an evolved wd can only be seen at uv wavelengths . the fast rotating red giant accreted the polluted material from the progenitor of the wd earlier in its evolution .",
    "rv monitoring of the remaining barium cspne , webo  1 ( bond et al . 2003 ) , a  70 ( miszalski et al . 2012b ) and hen  2 - 39 ( miszalski et al . 2013 ) , should also reveal long term rv orbits .    in terms of [ wr ] cspne , the best candidate for a wide",
    "binary is the poly - polar pn cpd-56@xmath10 8032 ( hen  3 - 1333 , chesneau et al .",
    "it has a resolved dust disk with an inner radius of 97 au and a binary may be necessary to explain its presence in hen  3 - 1333 ( van winckel et al .",
    "hen  3 - 1333 also features dual - dust chemistry that is often associated with binarity .",
    "an intriguing feature of hen  3 - 1333 is that the central star experiences quasi - periodic dust obscuration events every @xmath35 yrs ( see miszalski et al .",
    "2011c ) , possibly the result of a periastron interaction with a companion .",
    "miszalski et al .",
    "( 2011c ) could reproduce the dust formation at 97 au , much further out than where a companion in a 5 yr orbit would be located .",
    "manick et al .",
    "( 2015 ) rule out a close binary based on rv measurements .",
    "we encourage further observations of this intriguing object to determine whether a wide binary is present .",
    "another promising candidate is hen  2 - 113 , which has several features in common with hen  3 - 1333 ( lagadec et al .",
