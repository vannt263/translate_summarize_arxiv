    "on the other hand , for a random walk on a two dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice , the probability density is given by belisle s law @xcite @xmath9 .",

    "a winding sector is a set of connected cells .",

    "clearly , the behavior is exponential as soon as @xmath32 .",
    "this is to be compared to the brownian path integral result @xmath33 ( dashed curve in figure 3 b ) ) .",

    "it is manifest that as @xmath2 increases , @xmath36 is closer and closer to the sle result @xmath39 for brownian curves .",

    "this means that , quite generally and as expected , global properties of random walks do indeed hold for brownian curves .",
    "a good agreement is also obtained for example while comparing the radii of gyration of random walks to those of brownian curves , as we will see in section 2 . however ,",
    "when details ( for instance the properties of winding - sectors taken separately ) are considered , the situation is less favorable . in that case",
    ", it is not a priori clear if and how numerical simulations on random walks give non ambiguous informations on brownian curves , as already seen for spitzer and belisle s laws .",
    "let us turn to the fractal properties of the external frontiers of random walks . when estimating the scaling and the hausdorff dimension of the perimeter of its frontier , a characteristic length for the random walk is needed .",
    "a natural candidate is its radius of gyration , for which two definitions are possible .",

    "incidentally , and as a further check of the correspondance between random walks and brownian curves as far as their global characteristics are concerned , the average total arithmetic area @xmath49 as a function of @xmath50 is plotted in figure 6 .",
    "the @xmath43 distribution , which has already been computed analytically for closed brownian curves , again by means of path integral methods @xcite , gives @xmath51 . using this input",
    ", one should get [ fine ] < s > = t = < r_g^2 > 3.77 < r_g^2 > which is indeed the straight line plotted in figure 6 .",
    "interestingly enough , ( [ fine ] ) is related to random walks anisotropies- clearly , for an homogeneous isotrope disk , one should have @xmath52 .",
    "the ratio @xmath53 , where @xmath54 are the eigenvalues of the inertia tensor , can also be used to characterize the anisotropy .",
    "for closed brownian curves , it has been known for some time @xcite that [ asph1 ] = 3.07 pointing to an elongated shape .",
    "we will come back to this point in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "[ fig6 ]    . ]",
    "once the characteristic length @xmath55 of a random walk has been identified , one can turn to investigate the scaling of the perimeter of its external frontier with respect to this length . the external frontier is geometrically defined , accordingly to the external frontier of a brownian curve , as the set of points , i.e. the part of the walk , obtained by arriving from infinity and stopping when one meets for the first time the walk . in figure 7",
    "a ) , the scaling is displayed for closed random walks with a number of steps from @xmath56 to @xmath38 .",
    "the straight line shows that the external frontier scales like @xmath57 leading to the same hausdorff dimension @xmath0 as the one obtained via sle for brownian curves .",

    "up to now , only the geometrical outer spreading of the random walks or of the brownian curves has been taken into account to define their external frontiers .",
    "a consequence is that there is no way to span the frontiers defined in this way with a coherent orientation , as can be seen for example in figure 1 and figure 2 .",
    "the impossibility to have a coherent orientation might incline to reconsider the definition of the frontiers . to this end , one should pay a particular attention to the possible time histories of a given random walk or brownian curve .",
    "a random walk on the lattice is nothing but a set of oriented edges spanned with kirchoff conservation laws at the vertices .",
    "consider first the random walk of figure 2 .",

    "they constitute a fjord which can be opened to the outside by two simple cuts at particular intersections . in figure 2",
    "a ) and figure 2 b ) are shown two possible time histories of the random walk ( by convention when a random walk intersects itself at a later time it goes under its first trace ) . on the one hand ,",
    "the time history of figure 2 a ) is such that both the @xmath16-winding sectors are inside the walk ( the fjord is closed ) and its external frontier coincides indeed with its geometrical outer spreading ( i.e. the part of the walk where one stops when arriving from infinity and meeting for the first time the walker ) . as already stressed , there is no coherent orientation on such a frontier . on the other hand ,",
    "the time history of figure 2 b ) is such that both the 0-winding sectors of the walk are now connected between themselves and to the sea ( the fjord is opened ) . a frontier",
    "can then be defined by following the time history in figure 2 b ) and , while doing so , by selecting the part of the walk which always has on one of its side the @xmath16-winding sector ( the outside ) and , necessarily , on the other side a ( @xmath59)-winding sector .",
    "it is manifest that this frontier is , by construction , spanned with a coherent orientation .",
    "contrarily to the external geometrical frontier , it explores the inside of the walk while spanning the opened fjord .",
    "rephrased in terms of cuts at intersections , the two cuts depicted in figure 2 c ) are used to transform the walk of figure 2 a ) into the walk of figure 2 b ) .",
    "note that in this cutting process with an even number of cuts -here 2- , one has obtained a single random walk ( it would not be the case if , for example , only one cut would have been used : two disconnected walks would then have been obtained ) .",
    "let us take advantage of what has been said but now for brownian curves , for example the curve of figure 1 .",
    "consider the time history in figure 1 a ) : the external frontier is the geometrical one , as well as the frontiers of the @xmath10-winding sectors inside , which are all disconnected .",
    "the three 0-winding sectors which could be connected to the outside by simple cuts are inside the curve ( closed fjord ) .",
    "however , eight cuts , as shown in figure 1 b ) , are sufficient to connect between themselves these 0-winding sectors and to open to the outside the fjord . also , these cuts connect between themselves , when possible , the winding sectors of same winding number ( here respectively the four @xmath6-winding sectors in the upper part of the path and the three @xmath60-winding sectors in the lower part of the curve ) .",
    "one arrives at the brownian curve of figure 1 c ) whose frontier is obtained by following the time history in figure 1 c ) and , while doing so , selecting the part of the curve which always has on one of its side the @xmath16-winding sector ( the outside ) and on the other side a ( @xmath61)-winding sector .",
    "this frontier has , by construction , a coherent orientation - winding sectors inside the curve are obtained accordingly by following the time history of the curve and selecting the part which has always on one of its sides the @xmath10-winding sector and on the other side a @xmath62)-winding sector . by construction , these @xmath10-winding frontiers have a coherent orientation . ] .",
    "one also notes that the lake inside the @xmath60-winding sector remains disconnected from the outside sea .",
    "more generally , for any given brownian curve , one can always find a time history with an oriented frontier consisting of the external + fjords frontier . clearly , this oriented frontier is more intricate than the usual one since it does excursions inside the curve while spanning the opened fjords , which always happen to stretch from one side to another side of the curve .",
    "one might wonder if these excursions around the fjords are sufficiently intricate to increase the hausdorff dimension of the frontier , if such a dimension happens to exist .",
    "numerical simulations in figure 7 b ) indicate that the external+fjords ( oriented ) frontier perimeter scales like @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , up to logarithmic corrections , the hausdorff dimension is essentially unchanged and remains equal to @xmath64 .",
    "however , when pushing further the logic of avoiding the @xmath16-winding sectors by also removing the lakes inside the random walks , i.e. when considering the external+fjords+lakes ( disconnected ) frontier , the numerics in figure 7 c ) indicate a scaling with a hausdorff dimension @xmath65 .",
    "the increase of the dimension is nothing but an indication of the more and more intricate nature of the frontier , which goes not only around the fjords , but also deep inside the curve around the lakes ( see figure 8 for an illustration of the distribution of fjords and lakes for a random walk of @xmath66 steps ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that the ratio of the lakes average area to the fjords average area increases from @xmath67 to @xmath68 when @xmath2 goes from 15000 to 1000000 , indicating that the lakes proliferate deep inside the walk when @xmath2 increases .    ;",

    "if one removes inside the percolation cluster the non percolating islands ( see figure 9 c ) ) which can be connected to the outside by cuts at vertices ( `` fjords '' ) , the hausdorff dimension of the external+fjords frontier becomes @xmath69 ( see figure 10 c ) ) .",
    "if one also removes the non percolating islands deep inside the percolation cluster ( `` lakes '' ) , one arrives at a disconnected percolation external+fjords+lakes frontier ( see figure 9 a ) ) for which numerical simulations ( see figure 10 a ) ) indicate a hausdorff dimension @xmath72 .",
    "percolation and closed random walks happen to have only in commun the scaling dimension @xmath64 for their external frontier , the other dimensions being different ( @xmath69 versus @xmath64 , and @xmath73 versus @xmath74 ) .",
    "it is however striking to note that in percolation the fjords are sufficiently intricate to increase the hausdorff dimension of the perimeter , whereas there are not so for random walks .",
    "a @xmath10-winding sector has been defined in section [ sec1 ] as a set of connected cells of same winding @xmath10 inside a random walk ( see figure 11 ) .",

    "insufficient statistics makes it delicate to address larger @xmath10 which would require an increase of @xmath2 leading to rapidly prohibitive cpu times .    in figure 12",
    ", one considers , for each winding number , the set of all the corresponding winding sectors inside the random walks .",
    "the average value @xmath45 of the area enclosed by these winding sectors , plotted as a function of the square of their radius of gyration , leads to the scaling @xmath78 .",
    "this scaling is similar to the scaling of the arithmetic area of the random walks thenselves , plotted in figure 6 .",

    "this result is somehow surprising since a winding sector by itself can not be considered as a closed random walk .",
    "nevertheless , anisotropy properties of the winding sectors do confirm this similarity between the random walks and their winding sectors .",
    "numerical simulations for the ratio @xmath79 give for the @xmath24-winding sectors a value in the range 2.9 - 3.1 and for the @xmath80-winding sectors values in the range 2.9 - 3.2 , which slightly increase with @xmath10 .",
    "again , these results are close to @xmath81 of section [ sec2 ] for the random walks .    in figure 13 , the scaling of the winding sector frontiers perimeters is considered .",
    "let us first look at the perimeter of a winding sector external ( geometric ) frontier ( see figure 11 a ) ) .",

    "this is the frontier seen from the inside of the @xmath10-winding sector and avoiding the cells belonging to the other sectors .",
    "the scaling ( straight line b ) ) is @xmath84 , which again leads to the hausdorff dimension @xmath85 .",
    "a random walk may also exhibit many back - trackings : one can define the frontier ( see figure 11 c ) ) as the external frontier + the other windings + the edges inside the sector which have been spanned by the walker in both directions .",
    "the scaling ( straight line c ) ) is still @xmath86 , leading again to the dimension @xmath83 .",
    "it follows that whatever the definition of the frontier , the scaling is robust with a hausdorff dimension remaining approximatively @xmath83 .    as a way of testing this robustness",
    ", one could relax a little the definition of a winding sector by considering that two adjacent cells belong to the same sector provided they have the same winding number , regardless if their common edges are spanned or not by the walker ( see an example in figure 14 ) .",
    "[ fig14 ]    ) -winding sectors are considered as belonging to a unique sector . ]    for the scaling ( with the square of the radius of gyration ) of the average area enclosed by such winding sectors , the numerical simulations give a result similar to what was obtained previously .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the ratio @xmath79 which remains practically unchanged .",
    "considering now the perimeter scalings , for the external frontier scaling the linear fit in figure 15 a ) is @xmath87 meaning that the hausdorff dimension remains @xmath0 .",
    "now , for the external+other windings and external+other windings+back - trackings frontiers scalings in figure 15 b ) and figure 15 c ) respectively , linear fits with slopes slightly different from @xmath64 might be expected .",
    "however , a thorough analysis of the ratio of the frontiers perimeters yields the fits @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "one concludes that the hausdorff dimension of the winding sectors inside the random walk , is , as for the random walk itself , @xmath0 .",
    "let us summarize the results obtained so far :    * we have discussed the correspondance between lattice random walk simulations and brownian curves .",
    "the correspondance works well for global properties of the curves , as , for example , their radius of gyration , anisotropy and total arithmetic area .",
    "however , the arithmetic area of the @xmath10-winding sectors does not reproduce the path integral result for brownian curves ( eventhough , as already said , it does for their sum , i.e. the total arithmetic area ) .",
    "* we have proposed a new definition for the frontier of a random walk and of a brownian curve .",
    "it spans the @xmath16-winding sectors fjords connected to the sea .",
    "contrary to the geometrical external frontier ( the hull ) , this frontier has a coherent orientation .",
    "* we have numerically established that , for the random walk , the hausdorff dimension of both its external ( geometric ) frontier and its external+fjords ( oriented ) frontier ( which does incursion inside the walk around the fjords ) is , as for brownian curves , @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the hausdorff dimension of the external+fjords+lakes ( disconnected ) frontier is @xmath90 , which indicates that the @xmath16-winding lakes deep inside the walk contribute in a major way to the fractal properties of the frontier .",
    "* we have numerically established that , for the random walk winding sectors , the hausdorff dimension is robust at the value @xmath0 .",
    "the scaling of the area of a winding sector with its radius of gyration is also very close to the scaling of the random walk itself .",
    "let us stress again that the scalings of the winding sectors are not obvious to interpret .",
    "still one has found on a 2d square lattice strong numerical evidences which indicate some deep similarities between the random walks and their winding sectors -anisotropy , hausdorff dimensions of the frontiers- , at least as far as the scalings are concerned .",
    "it would certainly be satisfying to understand more deeply these numerical results .",
    "again , the similarity between the random walks and their winding sectors is especially puzzling .",
    "the scaling dimension @xmath64 is known to be related via sle to a conformal field theory with central charge @xmath16 ( free fermions ) . for the scaling dimension @xmath69 ,",
    "the central charge is again @xmath16 .",
    "however , the eventual link between those conformal models and closed random walks frontiers or winding sectors frontiers is far from obvious .",
    "clearly , the @xmath16-winding sectors play an essential role for increasing the hausdorff dimension of the closed random walk from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "we have seen in section [ sec1 ] that the @xmath16-winding sector arithmetic area @xmath91 is overestimated on the lattice .",
