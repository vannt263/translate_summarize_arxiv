    "in general ,  when studying supersymmetric theories in flat spacetime , the background metric is assumed to be ordinary minkowski .",

    "non trivial topology , implies non trivial field configurations , that enter dynamically in the action .",
    "we shall investigate their impact using the effective potential method @xcite .",
    "it is known that when supersymmetric theories are studied in non trivial spacetimes ( or at finite temperature ) , supersymmetry is , in general , spontaneously broken .",
    "this is due to the appearance of vacuum terms which have different coefficients for fermions and bosons .  as a result ,",
    "the effective potential of the theory has no longer its minimum at zero thus , supersymmetry is broken .",
    "this quite general phenomenon can only be avoided , if in some way these vacuum terms are canceled @xcite .",
    "the existence of non trivial field configurations due to non trivial topology ( twisted fields ) , was first pointed out by isham @xcite and then adopted by others @xcite .  in our case",
    ", the topological properties of @xmath4 are classified by the first stieffel class @xmath5 which is isomorphic to the singular ( simplicial ) cohomology group @xmath6 because of the triviality of the @xmath7 sheaf .",
    "now , it is known that @xmath8 classifies the twisting of a bundle .  to be exact ,",
    "it describes and classifies the orientability of a bundle globally .  in our case , the classification group is @xmath9 and , we have two locally equivalent bundles , which are however different globally _ i.e. _  cylinder - like and moebius strip - like .",
    "the mathematical lying behind , is to find the sections that correspond to these two bundles , classified completely by @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the sections we shall consider are real scalar fields and majorana spinor fields .",
    "these fields carry a topological number called moebiosity ( twist ) , which distinguishes between twisted and untwisted fields .",
    "the twisted fields obey anti - periodic boundary conditions , while untwisted fields periodic in the compactified dimension ( see below ) .",
    "normally one takes scalars to obey periodic and fermions anti - periodic boundary conditions , disregarding all other configurations that may arise from non trivial topology .",
    "here we shall consider all these configurations .",
    "if @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 denote the untwisted and twisted scalar and twisted and untwisted spinor respectively , then the boundary conditions in the @xmath2 dimension are , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for scalars and @xmath17 , @xmath18 for fermions , where @xmath19 stands for the remaining two spatial and one time dimensions not affected by the boundary conditions .",

    "we assign the untwisted fields twist @xmath20 ( the trivial element of @xmath21 and the twisted fields twist @xmath22 ( the non trivial element of @xmath9 ) .",

    "supersymmetry transformations impose some restrictions on the twist assignments of the superfield component fields @xcite .",
    "grassmann fields can not acquire vacuum expectation value ( vev ) since we require the vacuum value to be a scalar representation of the lorentz group .",
    "thus , the question is focused on the two scalars.the twisted scalar can not acquire non  zero  vev  @xcite , consequently , only untwisted scalars are allowed to develop vev s .",

    "another left chiral superfield containing the twisted scalar field and the twisted weyl fermion .",
    "writing down ( [ lagra ] ) in component form , we get ( writing weyl fermions in the majorana representation):@xmath37we can explicitly check that moebiosity is conserved at all interaction vertices _",

    "the moebiosity of  @xmath11 and @xmath38 is @xmath20 while for @xmath39  and  @xmath40 is @xmath41 .  one can use the @xmath9 cyclic group properties to prove that the lagrangian ( [ test ] ) has moebiosity @xmath20 .",
