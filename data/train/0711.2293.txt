    "<S> * supernova 2006gy in the galaxy ngc 1260 is the most luminous one recorded @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its progenitor might have been a very massive ( @xmath0 ) star @xcite , but that is incompatible with hydrogen in the spectrum of the supernova , because stars @xmath1 are believed to have shed their hydrogen envelopes several hundred thousand years before the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the progenitor might have arisen from the merger of two massive stars @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the collision frequency of massive stars in a dense and young cluster ( of the kind to be expected near the center of a galaxy ) is sufficient to provide a reasonable chance that sn 2006gy resulted from such a bombardment . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the correct explanation , then we predict that when the supernova fades ( in a year or so ) a dense cluster of massive stars becomes visible at the site of the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> *    # 1*[#1  ed ] * # 1*[#1  ed ] * # 1*[#1  simon ] * # 1*[#1  simon ] *    the presence of hydrogen in supernova sn2006gy is hard to reconcile with the explosion of a @xmath2 star , as such a star loses its hydrogen - rich envelope several hundreds of thousands of years before the star explodes . </S>",
    "<S> also the location of the supernova , at a projected distance of about 1  </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath3pc ) from the nucleus of the host galaxy ngc1260 is remarkable .    </S>",
    "<S> a merger between a very massive ( @xmath0 ) hydrogen - depleted star that already had a core in an advanced phase of helium burning , with a hydrogen rich main - sequence star of 10 to 40 , @xmath4 to @xmath5 years prior to the supernova explosion may explain the unusual brightness of the supernova , the presence of the hydrogen in the interstellar medium surrounding the supernova and the presence of hydrogen in the supernova itself @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of young star clusters which are in a state of dynamical core collapse is crucial for the proposed scenario . during core collapse and the subsequent post - core collapse evolution of the star cluster </S>",
    "<S> a runaway collision product can grow , and even though the star is likely to be much more extended than usual , subsequent bombardment will result in a net increase in mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eventually the massive star is expected to prostrate to a black hole of intermediate mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the supernova in which the black hole forms is likely to be unusually bright with some hydrogen in its envelope left - over from the last collision .    </S>",
    "<S> the inner few hundred parsec around the center of the milky way is populated with several bright and dense star clusters , of which the arches cluster @xcite and quintuplet @xcite are the most well known , but many others exist . </S>",
    "<S> the proximity of the galactic center and the depth of the potential well of the bulge causes these clusters to be denser than elsewhere in the galaxy @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the sb / sb0 host galaxy ngc 1260 appears rather ordinary , though the presence of a dust lane and of hii emission near its center suggests that a recent burst of star formation occurred near its center @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate , taking an intergalactic extinction of @xmath6mag @xcite into account , that within the observed isophotal magnitude @xmath7 ( @xmath8kpc ) @xcite and adopting @xmath9 @xcite , ngc1260 has a mass of @xmath10 .    assuming that the mass enclosed within a radius @xmath11 from the center of ngc1260 is , like in the milky way @xcite described with @xmath12 , but for ngc1260 @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we can then calculate the lower limit to the tidal radius @xcite for a cluster of mass @xmath14 in a circular orbit at distance @xmath11 from the center of ngc1260 .    </S>",
    "<S> star clusters that experience core collapse before the most massive stars have left the main sequence can grow a supermassive star via collision runaway . </S>",
    "<S> the mass which can then grow within @xmath15myr can be estimated using eq.2 of @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we have to make some assumption about the stellar mass function in the cluster , but for clarity adopting a mean mass of @xmath16 is sufficient without detailed knowledge of the exact shape of the initial mass function . for a reasonable range of cluster densities and distances from the center of ngc 1260 we can now calculate the mass that can be grown in the cluster in @xmath15myr .    in fig.[fig : </S>",
    "<S> mrunaway ] we present the results of our calculations using a king @xcite model with a depth of the central potential expressed in the dimension - less parameter @xmath17 , which can produce at most a @xmath18 star in a collision runaway . for shallower as well as for more concentrated king models the maximum mass for the supermassive star decreases , as well as the mass of the cluster that produces such stars .    </S>",
    "<S> the last collision before the supernova , must have occurred with a relatively unevolved main - sequence star , and deposited large quantities of hydrogen on the surface of the collision product . by the time of the supernova </S>",
    "<S> not all surface hydrogen of the last collision was blown away , as about one of hydrogen was observed in the supernova @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of the hydrogen deposited on the stellar surface during the last collision was found in the interstellar medium surrounding the supernova , and exceeds some 0.55 @xcite but could be as high as 2030 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this mass may have come from the strong stellar wind in the last few @xmath19 years before the supernova , blowing away the hydrogen which was deposited to the stellar surface during the collision . a tentative upper limit for the rate of mass loss of the progenitor star is @xmath20/yr to @xmath21/yr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these observed mass loss rates are consistent with those of detailed evolutionary calculations of stars of 500@xmath22 @xcite . at this mass loss rate </S>",
    "<S> it takes roughly @xmath23 to @xmath24 years to blow 20 in the form of a stellar wind from the surface of the supermassive star . </S>",
    "<S> this time scale is of the same order as our estimated average time between collisions of @xmath25  years ( see fig.[fig : mrunaway ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity of the supernova explosion in collapsar models is driven by the angular momentum transfer from the critically rotating black hole to its surrounding torus . the available energy reservoir , and thus the supernova brightness , </S>",
    "<S> would then be proportional to the mass of the black hole @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed brightness of sn2006gy would then be consistent with the collapse of an unusually massive star , and the consequent formation of a rather massive ( @xmath26 ) black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we are unaware of detailed simulations of such an unusual supernova to bolster our arguments , but the consequences for the supernova seem to be profound and we encourage further research in this direction .    the amount of hydrogen in the pre - supernova stellar envelope , the amount of hydrogen in the interstellar medium , the mass - loss rate of the supernova progenitor derived from the observations and the enormous brightness of the supernova , bracket the values we derive based on the collision runaway scenario . we therefore conclude that a collision of a @xmath27 main - sequence star with a supermassive star @xmath28 years before the supernova could conveniently explain the range of oddities surrounding sn2006gy . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that a young ( @xmath29myr ) , dense and massive ( @xmath30 ) star cluster is present at the location of the supernova . at this moment </S>",
    "<S> the star cluster can not be seen , but adopting a mass - to - ligh ratio of @xmath31 , which is consistent with the starburst99 @xcite models for a @xmath29myr old stellar population , the cluster should become noticeable as soon as the supernova fades below an absolute magnitude of about -8.2 mag for @xmath32 and -5.7mag , for a @xmath19 star cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> the environment in which the collision runaway can be initiated is rather exotic , as the cluster has to be sufficiently massive and dense to warrant dynamical core collapse within a few myr . in star clusters </S>",
    "<S> sufficiently massive to grow a massive collision product there are typically between 60 and 600 stars @xmath33 , and consequently only one out of 60600 type ib / c or type ii supernovae in these clusters will be of this peculiar bright type , like sn2006gy . </S>",
    "<S> if in a nuclear or a normal starburst ten per cent of all stars are formed in sufficiently dense clusters , one would expect that about one out of 600 - 6,000 supernovae to be of this type .    ./journals_nature.def    10    , r. </S>",
