    "in this work we study the process @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes a centrally produced cluster of hadrons containing at least two jets .",
    "the cdf collaboration at fnal has presented data on this process @xcite .",
    "such an interaction is diffractive since the colliding hadrons emerge intact with only a small loss of longitudinal momentum .",
    "events are characterised by the production of two jets in the central region , separated from the final state hadrons by rapidity gaps .",
    "therefore they are also known as `` gap - jet - gap '' events .",
    "previous calculations of this process @xcite have been carried out at the parton level and have overestimated the total dijet production cross - section by several orders of magnitude . in this paper we see that by including the effects of hadronisation and by using the diffractive parton density functions extracted by the h1 collaboration @xcite , it is possible to fit the data in a natural way .",
    "in particular , we shall show that the large suppression which arises from the hadronisation corrections means that we are able to fit the data with a `` gap survival probability '' of around 10% that is consistent with theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "there are two approaches to central dijet production that have been considered in the literature :    1 .   the factorised model . in this approach",
    "one assumes that factorisation @xcite can be applied to the process , just as in inclusive hard scattering processes , modulo an overall multiplicative factor which has come to be called the `` gap survival probability '' @xcite .",
    "following ingelman and schlein ( is ) , one can go further and assume so - called `` regge factorisation '' @xcite which assumes that the process is driven by pomeron exchange , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "thus one assigns an experimentally determined parton density and flux factor to the exchanged pomeron @xcite .",
    "it is expected that this factorisation will be violated at the tevatron @xcite and the extent to which the breaking can be accommodated , at some level , by a gap survival factor is very much an open question .",
    "central dijet production within a factorised model has been studied before @xcite .",
    "2 .   the non - factorised model .",
    "these models have been developed in @xcite .",
    "they are exclusive in the sense that all energy lost by the interacting hadrons goes into the final state dijets .",
    "therefore we will see no pomeron remnants in the final state , as illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "this feature would manifest itself as a peak in the distribution showing the fraction of the available centre - of - mass energy which goes into the jets ; a feature which is absent in the cdf data .",
    "however this need not be the case for tevatron run ii which ought to be a good place to look for evidence of a non - factorised contribution .",
    "subsequently , we shall not consider such models .",
    "we use the is approach in this paper and compare the predictions of the monte carlo event generator , pomwig @xcite , with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed at @xmath2 tev and diffractive events are selected by applying cuts on the hadronic momentum loss .",
    "the details of the experiment are described in @xcite and the relevant cuts are :    * the anti - proton fractional energy loss @xmath3 satisfies @xmath4 .",
    "such a condition corresponds to a rapidity gap on the anti - proton side .",
    "this cut is made by tagging the anti - proton . *",
    "the proton fractional energy loss @xmath5 satisfies @xmath6 .",
    "such a condition corresponds to a rapidity gap on the proton side . note that the proton is not tagged at cdf and the cut is made by looking for a rapidity gap on the proton side .",
    "* @xmath7 gev@xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the four - momentum transfer from the anti - proton squared .",
    "* the event must have two or more jets in the pseudo - rapidity region @xmath10 and at least two jets must have a minimum transverse energy of @xmath11 gev or 10 gev .",
    "the final state jets were found using the cone algorithm with a cone radius of 0.7 and an overlap parameter of 0.5 .",
    "with reference to figure 1 , we assign the pomeron a partonic content and the dijet production is driven by the perturbative qcd interaction of partons from the colliding pomerons . the production cross - section for this so - called `` double pomeron exchange '' process ( dpe )",
    "can be written + @xmath12 + where @xmath13 is the pomeron flux factor , @xmath14 is the fraction of the pomeron momentum carried by the parton entering the hard scattering and @xmath15 is the pomeron parton density function for partons of type @xmath16 .",
    "the rapidity of the outgoing partons is denoted @xmath17 and @xmath18 , their transverse momentum is @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes the qcd 2-to-2 scattering amplitudes . the parton transverse momentum , @xmath21 is equal to the jet transverse energy @xmath22 at the parton level .",
    "note that the dijets are accompanied by pomeron remnants which we observe in the final state alongside the jets and the diffracted hadrons .",
    "we use the h1 leading order pomeron fits to @xmath23 measurements @xcite .",
    "the measurement of @xmath23 is quark dominated and gluon sensitivity only enters through scaling violations .",
    "hence the gluon density has quite a large uncertainty .",
    "this is important for the gluon dominated dpe process .",
    "the gluon densities of the h1 fits are illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath24 relevant at the tevatron is in the region of 0.3 to 0.4 .",
    "fit 4 has a gluon content that is heavily suppressed relative to fits 5 and 6 , and fit 6 is peaked at high @xmath14 .",
    "fits 5 and 6 are now the favoured fits to describe h1 data .    in our analysis",
    "we also include the effect of non - diffractive contributions through an additional regge exchange , which we refer to as the reggeon contribution .",
    "this is expected to be important in the region of @xmath25 explored at the tevatron .",
    "following h1 , we estimate reggeon exchange by assuming that the reggeon can be described by the pion parton densities of owens @xcite . this contribution is added incoherently to the pomeron contribution . for more details of the implementation",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "figure 4 demonstrates the agreement between pomwig and an independent calculation for the total dpe cross - section as a function of the minimum jet transverse energy @xmath26 .",
    "these curves were produced using h1 fit 5 and contain only the pomeron exchange contribution .",
    "more interestingly , we see that the curve which describes the total cross - section after the effects of hadronisation and parton showering have been included shows a significant reduction relative to the naive parton level calculation",
    ". this suppression effect may be understood by observing that the effect is a shift in the cross - section by @xmath27 gev .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the broadening of the jet profile by the parton shower and hadronisation .",
    "the reduction is lower for the quark dominated fit ( h1 fit 4 ) since quark jets tend to have a narrower profile .",
    "now we turn our attention to the comparison of our theoretical predictions to the measured total cross - section .",
    "the analysis we perform includes the processes where the exchanges are either both pomerons or both reggeons .",
    "we do not include the case where one is a reggeon and the other is a pomeron , nor do we include interference contributions . whilst the latter may be small ,",
    "the former will not be if the pure reggeon contribution is not negligible .",
    "this limitation arises since pomeron - reggeon interactions are not yet included in pomwig .",
    "the results are presented in tables 1 and 2 ( for the data the first error is statistical and the second is systematic ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     _",
    "the total dpe cross - section at the parton shower and hadron levels . _    not surprisingly , the parton shower phase of pomwig is responsible for a large part of the suppression relative to the naive parton level prediction .      in figures 5 and 6",
    "we show distributions in number of events of the mean jet transverse energy , @xmath28 , the mean jet rapidity , @xmath29 , the azimuthal separation of the jets , @xmath30 , and the dijet mass fraction , @xmath31 : @xmath32 the sum in the numerator is over all particles in the dijets . some of these distributions have also been examined in @xcite . in figure 5",
    "we compare the data to results at the parton and hadron level , and we show the reggeon contribution separately . in figure 6 we show results at the hadron level for the three different h1 pomeron parton density functions .    we urge caution",
    "when comparing the data and theory as is done in figures 5 and 6 since the data are not corrected for detector effects of the cdf jets . ] .",
    "the existence of the long tail to low angles in the @xmath30 distribution illustrates the dangers : there is no possibility to produce such a long tail in a hadron level monte carlo simulation .",
    "we have explored the effect of smearing the momenta of all outgoing hadrons and the qualitative effect is to flatten the @xmath33 distribution , enhance the @xmath30 tail and soften the @xmath31 distribution .",
    "nevertheless , we are unable to draw any strong conclusions until the corrected data become available .",
    "the work of this paper has focused on the so - called double pomeron exchange process recently measured at the tevatron .",
    "we have extended previous calculations by including the effects of parton showering and hadronisation and found that they lead to a suppression of the cross - section relative to the naive parton level by a factor of around 4 .",
    "we also found that , in the kinematic region probed by the tevatron , the effect of non - diffractive ( reggeon ) exchange is probably important . at the present time",
    "the issue of gap survival is not very well understood .",
    "however , it is encouraging that we are able to describe the data with a gap survival probability of around 10% which is consistent with previous theoretical estimates .",
