    "there are many areas in modern physics which require accurate atomic calculations .",
    "this includes parity and time invariance violation in atoms  @xcite , search for variation of the fundamental constants  @xcite , atomic clocks  @xcite , etc .",
    "calculations are needed for planing of the experiments and for interpretation of the results .",
    "accuracy of atomic calculations is often a limitation factor .",
    "for example , the most accurate measurements of the parity non - conservation ( pnc ) in atoms was done in boulder in 1997 for the cesium atom  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the measurements is 0.35% .",
    "theoretical accuracy of best calculations is on the level of 0.4 - 0.5% and as a result the accuracy of extraction of the weak charge of the cesium nucleus is only 0.6%  @xcite .",
    "the situation is even worse for the pnc in thallium where best experimental accuracy is 1%  @xcite while the accuracy of best calculations is 3%  @xcite and 2.5%  @xcite . since atomic pnc measurements serve as an important source of information about low energy physics and possible extensions to the standard model , further improvements in the accuracy of atomic calculations is highly desirable .",
    "in present paper we limit our discussion to monovalent atoms keeping in mind pnc in cs and tl and other similar important applications .",
    "ground state configuration of thallium is [ xe]@xmath3 and to some extend it can be treated as an atom with one external electron above the [ xe]@xmath4 closed - shell core .",
    "this approach was used in our early calculations of the pnc in tl  @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed however that for more accurate results tl should be treated as an atom with three external electrons above the [ xe]@xmath5 closed - shell core .",
    "this is because the @xmath6 electrons are easy to excite which is evident from the existence of the states in thallium discrete spectrum which belong to the @xmath7 configuration .",
    "a method which combines the configuration interaction ( ci ) technique for valence electrons with the many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) for the core - valence correlations was suggested in ref .",
    "recent calculations of the tl pnc performed with the use of this method @xcite achieved only moderate improvement of accuracy , from 3% in ref .",
    "@xcite to 2.5% in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in present paper we advocate a different approach which treats thallium atom as a monovalent system but includes dominating classes of core - valence correlations in all orders .",
    "it is based on the all - order correlation potential method which was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and used in a number of calculations mostly for alkali - metal atoms  @xcite . to make it work equally well for other atoms like thallium",
    "we extend the technique to include one more class of higher - order diagrams , the _ ladder _ diagrams .",
    "this diagrams describe residual coulomb interaction of the external electron with the core .",
    "the idea of the extension is inspired by the coupled - cluster ( cc ) approach .",
    "this is another powerful method which is widely used for monovalent atoms . in this approach ,",
    "the many - electron wave function of an atoms is written in terms of single , double , etc .",
    "excitations from the reference hartree - fock wave function .",
    "the accuracy depends on the number of terms included into expansion and limited by available computer power .",
    "the method was used by many groups for accurate calculations of wide range of properties of many - electrons atoms ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) including pnc in cs  @xcite .",
    "there are plans to use this approach to improve the accuracy of calculations of the pnc in cs by including more terms into the expansion  @xcite .",
    "although the cc approach can produce very accurate results it is computationally very demanding .",
    "even relatively simple singe - double approximation takes significant computer resources but insufficiently accurate for some atoms , e.g. heavy alkali - metal atoms  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the all - order correlation potential method is very efficient .",
    "however , it produces accurate results only for @xmath0 and @xmath1 states of alkali - metal atoms .",
    "the accuracy for other monovalent atoms and for the @xmath2 states of alkali - metal atoms is significantly lower . in general ,",
    "the overlap between wave functions of the valence and core electrons must be small for accurate results .",
    "small overlap would mean small residual coulomb interaction between valence and core electrons . to overcome this limitation of the all - order correlation potential method we use the cc - like equations to include residual coulomb interaction between valence and core electrons in all orders .",
    "corresponding terms in the mbpt are presented by ladder diagrams .    to test the technique we calculate lowest @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 energy levels of cesium and thallium .",
    "consideration of the lowest states is sufficient for testing of the calculations of the correlations .",
    "this is because correlations are smaller for excited states and within the same technique accuracy of calculations is usually better for excited states .",
    "therefore , wide range of the different states of monovalent atoms are covered .",
    "we demonstrate that the inclusion of the ladder diagrams leads to significant improvements in the accuracy of calculation .",
    "this opens a way of atomic structure calculations for many important applications with the accuracy which was not available before .",
    "the all - order correlation potential method was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite and successfully used for a number of calculations for alkali - metal atoms and their isoelectronic ions .",
    "the method is based on the use of the so - called correlation potential @xmath8 which is defined in such a way that its expectation value over a wave function @xmath9 of a valence electron is equal to the many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) expression for the correlation correction to the energy of the electron @xmath10 the correlation potential @xmath11 is a non - local operator similar to the hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange potential .",
    "it can be used in the hf equations for valence electrons to calculate the so - called brueckner orbitals @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the hf hamiltonian . solving the equation ( [ brueck ] ) for different states of external electron produces the wave functions and the energies which include correlations .",
    "following our earlier works  @xcite we use the all - order correlation potential @xmath14 which includes two classes of higher - order correlations : ( a ) screening of coulomb interaction between a valence electron and a core electron by other core electrons and ( b ) an interaction between an electron excited from the core and a hole created by this excitation .",
    "one more class of higher - order diagrams , iteration of the @xmath8-operator , is included by iterating the equations for brueckner orbitals ( [ brueck ] ) .",
    "the mbpt expansion for the correlation correction operator @xmath8 starts from the second order .",
    "all four brueckner - goldstone diagrams are shown on fig .",
    "[ sigma1 ] ( to be more precise matrix elements @xmath15 of the second - order correlation potential @xmath16 are shown ) .",
    "however , it is more convenient to use the feynman diagram technique to include dominating higher - order correlations .",
    "we do this for direct diagrams 1 and 3 on fig .",
    "[ sigma1 ] .",
    "direct diagrams strongly dominate over exchange ones in most of the cases and require accurate treatment .",
    "the higher - order effects for exchange diagrams ( 2 and 4 on fig .",
    "[ sigma1 ] ) are included in a semi - empirical way by introducing screening factors as it will be explained below .",
    "screening of coulomb interaction are included by inserting core polarization loops into coulomb lines as shown on fig .",
    "[ screening ] .",
    "hole - particle interaction in the polarization operator is shown on fig .",
    "[ hole - particle ] .",
    "the all - order @xmath8 operator is shown on fig .  [ sigma - all ] . this operator is drawn using feynman diagram technique , screened coulomb interaction ( fig .  [ screening ] ) and the core - polarization operator with the hole - particle interaction in it ( fig .",
    "[ hole - particle ] ) .",
    "this diagram does not include exchange terms .",
    "exchange diagrams are much smaller and screening for them is included in a semi - empirical way via screening factors @xmath17 .",
    "it is assumed that screening depends only on the multipolarity of the coulomb interaction @xmath18 and every coulomb integral @xmath19 in diagrams 2 and 4 on fig .",
    "[ sigma1 ] is replaced by @xmath20 , where screening factors @xmath17 are found from the calculation of the direct diagram ( fig .",
    "[ sigma - all ] ) .",
    "the values of the screening factors for cs and tl are given in table  [ tb : fk ] .",
    ".screening factors @xmath17 to calculate exchange diagrams of @xmath8 . [",
    "cols=\"^,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the efficiency of the present method of calculations is the same as for the standard sd approximations .",
    "although the equations ( [ lcore ] ) and ( [ lval ] ) have fewer terms than the sd equation the calculations are strongly dominated by a singe term which has double summation over states above the core .",
    "this term exists in both cases , the equations ( [ lcore ] ) and ( [ lval ] ) for ladder diagrams and in the standard sd equations .",
    "computer resources needed for the calculation of the all - order correlation potential @xmath8 are practically negligible compared to the iterations of the equations ( [ lcore ] ) and ( [ lval ] )",
    ". it would be correct to say that the use of the all - order correlation potential method in combination with the equations similar to the sd equations is a way to include important triple and higher excitations without affecting the efficiency of the calculations .",
    "another way of describing the method is to state that it adds one more class of the higher - order correlations to the all - order correlation potential method .",
    "this class represents residual coulomb interaction of the external electron with atomic core .",
    "the all - order correlation potential method is extended to include one more class of higher - order diagrams to all orders .",
    "this class describes residual coulomb interaction of an external electron with atomic core and represented by ladder diagrams .",
    "this is in addition to such higher - order effects as screening of coulomb interaction between atomic electrons by core electrons , interaction between an electron excited from the core with a hole created by this excitation and the iterations of the correlation operator .",
    "calculations of the energy levels of cesium and thallium show significant improvement in the accuracy .",
    "this opens a way of more accurate calculations for many important applications .",
