    "we then extracted photon arrival times from the event files .",
    "since the source is a binary , doppler shifting of the pulsations could broaden a periodogram made assuming a fixed periodicity , which could reduce or entirely eliminate our sensitivity to pulses .",
    "we consider the effects of binary orbital doppler shifting under the assumption of a circular orbit with 30@xmath4 inclination .",
    "this is reasonable because the eccentricity and inclination of 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 are estimated to be low under the assumption of gamma rays being produced via the inverse compton process @xcite .",

    "* for example ) and the primary star to be 1.4 @xmath20 ( for a neutron star ) . for the known orbital period ( 16.58 days ) , we find that the orbital speed of the primary star would be @xmath2 240250 km @xmath21 . in this case , the doppler shift in the putative pulse period is @xmath22 ( i.e. , @xmath23 s for a 20-ks observation for the minimum searching period of @xmath24 ) .",
    "this is smaller than the independent period bins ( e.g. , @xmath25 s for @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , and thus the blurring is not a concern for the individual observations",
    ". the doppler shift over a full orbit could be as large as @xmath28 s ( for @xmath26 ) , hence precluding searching for pulsations by combining observations .",
    "we searched for possible pulsations ( in the 0.510 kev and 17 kev bands ) from the source using the @xmath29-test @xcite in the individual _ swift _ and _ xmm - newton _ time series over the periods from the nyquist limit of each detector ( 5.2 s for mos1 and mos2 , 146 ms for pn , 5 s for xrt ) to 2000 s , and found no significant pulsations .",
    "the most significant peak occurred at @xmath30 in the _ xmm - newton _ data ( 0.510 kev ) , and the probability of its occurring by chance was @xmath2 8% . since this peak was not significant , we set an upper limit on the pulsed fraction to be @xmath31% or @xmath32% with 90% confidence , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are defined as @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the uncertainty in @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the uncertainty in @xmath42 , @xmath43 is counts in @xmath44-th bin , and @xmath45 is the total number of bins ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we find that the spectral index of 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 shows evidence of being anti - correlated with the 0.510 kev flux ( see fig .",

    "the same trend was also observed in two of the gamma - ray binaries above ( ls  i  @xmath361@xmath4303 , ls  5039 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) but not in psr  b1259@xmath063 @xcite .",
    "why such a correlation should be present in some systems , but not all , if indeed they all have a common nature , is puzzling .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed a pulsar wind / stellar wind interaction model for psr  b1259@xmath063 . in the model , the locations of the termination shock as a function of orbital phases",
    "are determined by orbital geometry and pressure balance of the two winds .",
    "the time scales of various physical processes ( e.g. , particle acceleration , the synchrotron radiation and the inverse compton processes ) and spectral parameters are then calculated .",
    "@xcite noted that different interaction models can be best tested using the time behavior of the x - ray luminosity and spectrum , and they demonstrated the x - ray flux and spectral variability with changing orbital phase for psr  b1259@xmath063 .    for 1fgl",
    "j1018.6@xmath05856 , the stellar wind outflow ( for o6v star companion ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be larger than but different in geometry from that in psr  b1259@xmath063 ( which has a be star companion ) , where the mass outflow rate is smaller but is more concentrated in the equatorial plane for the case of a be star @xcite . considering this , the effective mass outflow parameter ( @xmath46 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for an o6v star can be comparable to or larger than that of a be star .",
    "in such a case , the model predicts that the dominant physical process would be synchrotron radiation , consistent with what we infer from the correlation between radio and x - ray flux below .",
    "although it may be possible to apply the model to 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 given a detailed orbital geometry , the latter is not yet constrained so detailed modeling can not presently be done .",
    "we note that our observed hardness / flux correlation can not be due to orbital variation of @xmath14 .",
    "if it were , one would expect the count rate to be smaller for a harder spectrum , which we do not observe . if we assume that @xmath14 varies by as much as 10% for an orbit as has been seen in other gamma - ray binaries ( e.g. , ls  5039 and psr  b1259@xmath063 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the variation can affect the photon index by @xmath2 5% , which does not explain the much larger observed spectral variation .",
    "@xcite categorized gamma - ray binaries into three types based on radiative behavior and nature of the companion . according to the categorization , 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 should be similar to ls  5039 .",
    "@xcite argue that the two systems may differ based on the hardness / flux correlation in the gamma - ray band and the fact that the x - ray maximum coincides with the gamma - ray maximum for 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 but not for ls  5039 .",
    "however , we show that the large x - ray peak at phase 0 reported by @xcite is likely to be caused by occasional flaring behavior and is not obviously a persistent feature . the maximum of the sinusoidal modulation in the x - ray band lies at phase 0.30.4 which does not coincide with the 110 gev gamma - ray peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : radiotohardx ] ) .",
    "thus , the orbital phase offset between the x - ray ( @xmath4710 kev ) band and gamma - ray band ( 110 gev ) is common to both 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 and ls  5039 .",
    "we note that although the very bright `` flares '' previously reported near phase 0 for this source , in which the soft x - ray flux was seen to increase by factors of 35 , do not appear to be a persistent feature , some flux enhancement at that orbital phase is often present ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : spectra]a and b ) .",
    "indeed , at phase 0 , the x - ray flux is above the sinusoidal trend most of the time .",
    "however , no significant flux increase in the radio or hard x - ray band at this orbital phase has been observed @xcite .",
    "this is understandable if the flare amplitude during the radio and hard x - ray observations was small , and/or the observations did not sample the `` narrow '' flare phase well enough to make a sensitive detection of the flare . nevertheless , the sinusoidal phase of flux modulations in the radio , soft x - ray ( @xmath47 10 kev ) and hard x - ray ( 1840 kev ) bands are relatively well aligned ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : radiotohardx ] ) , implying that they are all misaligned with the gamma - ray phase .",
    "the phase alignment between the radio and the x - ray band may imply that the x - ray emission mechanism is the synchrotron process unlike in ls  i@xmath361@xmath4303 , where an offset between the radio and x - ray phases was observed , and the x - ray emission was suggested to be due to an inverse compton process @xcite .",
    "similar x - ray flares have been also seen in other systems ( e.g. , ls  i@xmath361@xmath4303 and ls  5039 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the flares in ls  i@xmath361@xmath4303 are aperiodic with kilo - second time scale @xcite , and those in ls  5039 seem to be periodic with 1020 ks time scale @xcite . although we were not able to clearly characterize the time scale of the flares in 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 , they seem to be periodic , and the duration is rather long ( @xmath48 210 ks ) , similar to those of ls  5039 but with relatively larger amplitudes .    the two systems ,",
    "1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 and ls  5039 , share many properties such as a flux / hardness correlation in the soft x - ray band , phase alignment between the soft and the hard x - ray band @xcite , and misalignment between the x - ray and gev gamma - ray orbital phase .",
    "however , they show different flux / hardness correlations in the gamma - ray band .",
    "detailed modeling and broadband observations in the future will help us to clearly tell whether or not the two systems are different in nature .",
    "we have analyzed _ swift _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ data for the gamma - ray binary 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 , and find the orbital period of the x - ray ( @xmath4710 kev ) flux to be 16.57@xmath490.11 days , consistent with the value measured in the gamma - ray band .",
    "we also show that the previously reported very large flux increase at phase 0 ( factors of @xmath2 35 ) occurred only for the first @xmath2 100 days of the _ swift _ observations although substantial increases in flux ( a factor of @xmath50 ) are seen frequently at that phase .",
    "the persistent maximum of the x - ray orbital modulation seems to occur at phase 0.30.4 and is significantly misaligned with the 110 gev gamma - ray peak .",
    "finally , we show evidence that 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 exhibits a correlation between spectral hardness and the flux in the 0.510 kev band , which is common to several gamma - ray binaries and can hopefully be used to help understand the nature of x - ray emission from these interesting objects . +",
