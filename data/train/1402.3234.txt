    "the understanding of the electromagnetic structure of the hadrons , and its connection with the underlying degrees of freedom in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , are amongst , two of the more interesting challenges in the hadronic physics . through the nucleon electro - excitation reactions , @xmath5",
    ", we can study the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon ( @xmath6 ) and the nucleon excitations ( @xmath7 ) , including also the @xmath8 states .",
    "the excitation of nucleon resonances occurs through the intermediate processes @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a virtual photon , and the cross sections of the processes can usually be expressed in terms of the electromagnetic transition form factors , or helicity transition amplitudes .",
    "those functions depend on the four - momentum transfer squared @xmath11 , and characterize the electromagnetic structure of such resonant states .",
    "the data extracted from experiments in facilities such as jefferson lab ( jlab ) and mami ( mainz ) , allow us to extract the electromagnetic transition form factors of resonant states in the region @xmath12 gev@xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , corresponding to the first and second resonance region @xmath15 gev , with @xmath16 being the @xmath17 invariant mass  @xcite .",
    "the planned jlab 12-gev upgrade will enable us to make a detailed study of the resonances in the third - resonance region ( @xmath18 gev )  @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence for the existence of a state @xmath0 with quantum numbers @xmath19 since the eighties  @xcite .",
    "( in the notation of the @xmath20 scattering it is labeled as @xmath21  @xcite . )",
    "the state @xmath22 is now classified as a three - star resonance , and found by several groups  @xcite in their partial wave analyses , and it is also included in some baryon - meson reaction models  @xcite . the resonance identified",
    "as @xmath22 has a small decay branching ratio for the @xmath20 channel , but significant decay branching ratios for the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 channels  @xcite , and thus , may have important roles in kaon  @xcite and hypernuclear production  @xcite .",
    "however , in some partial wave analysis like said ( gwu ) , the resonance is not present  @xcite .",
    "thus , the clear existence of the @xmath0 state is still controversial , although some authors defend that it should be classified as a four - star resonance  @xcite .",
    "a state @xmath26 with a mass near 1.7 gev collected also some interest as a possible partner of the @xmath27-pentaquark , non - strange anti - decuplet state  @xcite .",
    "however , recent experimental evidence on the existence of the @xmath27-pentaquark seems to have been weakened  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd simulations predict also @xmath28 states that can possibly be related to the @xmath0 state  @xcite .",
    "future experiments , like the ones planned at the jlab-12 gev upgraded facility , will help to establish or deny the existence of the @xmath0 state .",
    "if the existence of @xmath0 state is confirmed , measurement of the @xmath1 helicity amplitudes will be possible .",
    "thus , it is important to present predictions at this stage for the reaction associated with @xmath0 , as we do in the present study .    in the usual nonrelativistic quark models",
    "the resonances @xmath3 ( also called roper ) and @xmath0 can be classified as @xmath26 states with two different radial excitation of the nucleon , although the masses are different from the corresponding resonant poles  @xcite .",
    "the roper has intriguing properties that are difficult to explain in a context of the quark model framework  @xcite . in a nonrelativistic quark model description",
    "the mass of the roper is too heavy and the decay width is too narrow to be compatible with a three - quark ( @xmath29 ) system .",
    "therefore , several alternative descriptions were suggested , e.g. , by identifying the state as a quark bare core combined with gluon states ( @xmath30 ) , a molecular - type state ( @xmath31 ) , or a dynamically generated state by baryon and meson .",
    "however , recent data from clas and maid  @xcite for @xmath32 gev@xmath13 support the assumption that the @xmath33 is predominantly the first radial excitation of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "estimates made by constituent and light - front quark models gave a good description for the high @xmath34 region data .",
    "for a review concerning the @xmath3 resonance , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    based on the knowledge of the roper",
    ", one can raise the following question , whether or not the @xmath0 state can be described as an another radial excitation of the nucleon .",
    "some other works describe the state as a three - quark system  @xcite , as a baryon bare core with a meson cloud  @xcite , or @xmath35-meson and glueball excitations  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , suggestions that the state @xmath0 may be more likely generated dynamically by baryon - meson states  @xcite . the state @xmath0 is also predicted in algebraic models of qcd  @xcite and in the large @xmath36 limit  @xcite .",
    "the wave function of the @xmath0 is also estimated by lattice qcd simulations  @xcite .    as already recognized for the roper and several other resonance cases , the meson cloud dressing for the transition helicity amplitudes",
    "is expected to be important only in the low @xmath34 region  @xcite . at high @xmath34",
    "the valence quark degrees of freedom are expected to dominate and the helicity amplitudes follow the power laws , @xmath37 and @xmath38  @xcite . in this work , focusing on the high @xmath34 region , we predict the form factors and the helicity amplitudes of the @xmath1 reaction , using a relativistic constituent quark model and the assumption that the @xmath0 state is the second radial excitation of the nucleon state .",
    "that is our working hypothesis . in the near future",
    "our predictions can thus be indeed tested in the jlab 12-gev upgraded facility .    in",
    "the previous works the nucleon and @xmath3 structures were described in the covariant spectator quark model  @xcite as analogous states with different radial excitation . in there the @xmath3 wave function was determined uniquely from the nucleon wave function by imposing that the @xmath3 radial wave function is orthogonal to the nucleon radial wave function , without any new adjustable parameters in the model  @xcite . in the present work",
    "we extend the procedure to the second radial excitation of the nucleon ( first radial excitation of the roper ) , @xmath0 . in a similar manner",
    ", the radial wave function of @xmath0 can be determined by the two orthogonality conditions between the @xmath0 radial wave function and both of the roper and nucleon wave functions , again without any new adjustable parameters .",
    "the price we must pay for the present prediction is that the estimates of the electromagnetic properties are expected to be valid only in the high @xmath34 region , since the calculations are based exclusively on the valence quark degrees of freedom .",
    "we will conclude that the transition helicity amplitudes for the @xmath1 reaction have their magnitude and falloff very similar to those for the @xmath4 reaction for @xmath39 gev@xmath13 .",

    "@xcite the @xmath0 state is described by a baryon bare core with some radial excitations , combined with glueball and @xmath35 vibrational excitations . in both cases",
    "@xcite , we can expect a dominance of the bare core in the high @xmath34 region , since meson cloud is expected to be suppressed .      the ebac model  @xcite uses baryon - meson coupled - channel formalism to describe the photo- and electro - production of mesons by nucleons .",
    "in that framework the @xmath0 , identified as @xmath172 , is a state that evolves from an @xmath173 bare core state through its coupling with the @xmath174 and @xmath175 channels .",

    "the model parameters were fixed to reproduce masses and branching ratios .    in models that the @xmath0 state is generated by the baryon - meson interactions as the ones mentioned above  @xcite , we can expect a much larger spatial extended structure for @xmath0 , and consequently a faster falloff with @xmath34 for the associated transition amplitudes  @xcite .    from the discussions above ,",
    "we conclude that we can deduce the nature of the @xmath0 state by the @xmath34 behavior of the helicity amplitudes , which may be revealed in future experiments . assuming a dominance of the valence quark effects as we do",

    "however , several partial wave analyses and coupled - channel reaction models suggest the existence of another @xmath28 state near the mass 1.7 gev .",
    "see for instance refs .  @xcite .",
    "if there exist two @xmath28 states with very close masses around 1.7 gev , the experimental determination of the individual contributions will be very difficult .",
    "then , the transition helicity amplitudes extracted from the data would be a combination of the two resonances , and our model , that assumes only one radial excited state , would fail the description of the data .       the quark current associated with eq .",
