    "_ proof : _ please refer to the appendix .",
    "@xmath105    in other words , the optimal beamformer @xmath106 in can be obtained by performing eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath99 , if the channels satisfy the condition stated in theorem @xmath107 .",
    "in this section , we verify the performance of the proposed optimal power and beamforming resource allocation scheme through simulations .",
    "the relevant simulation parameters are summarized in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "there are @xmath108 dl users , @xmath109 ul users , and @xmath110 idle users ( potential eavesdroppers ) in the cell .",
    "all users are randomly and uniformly distributed between the reference distance and the maximum service distance of @xmath111 meters .",
    "the fd radio bs is located at the center of the system which is equipped with @xmath4 antennas .",
    "the small scale fading of the dl channels , ul channels , and inter - user channels is modeled as independent and identically distributed rayleigh fading .",
    "the multipath fading coefficients of the si channel are generated as independent and identically distributed rician random variables with rician factor @xmath112 db .",
    "besides , we assume @xmath113 to study the system performance . also , the ul users require a fixed minimum sinr of @xmath114 db , i.e. , @xmath115 db , @xmath116 , while the dl users require identical minimum sinrs , i.e. , @xmath117 .    .system parameters . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in figure [ fig : pt_sinr ] , we study the average total system transmit power versus the minimum required dl sinr , @xmath118 , for different numbers of antennas at the fd radio bs . it can be observed from figure [ fig : pt_sinr ] that the total transmit power is a monotonically increasing function with respect to the minimum required dl sinr .",
    "in particular , as the minimum dl sinr requirement becomes more stringent , the fd radio bs allocates more power to the dl information signals .",
    "meanwhile , more artificial noise power is also needed to neutralize the information leakage to the potential eavesdroppers .",
    "the higher dl transmit power leads in turn to a higher si which impairs the ul transmission .",
    "thus , the ul users also have to increase their transmit power in order to meet the minimum ul sinr requirements which results in an increase of the total system transmit power .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ fig : pt_sinr ] reveals that the total average system transmit power decreases with increasing number of fd radio bs antennas since extra degrees of freedom can be exploited for dl resource allocation and ul signal detection , when more antennas are available .    for comparison ,",
    "we also consider two baseline resource allocation schemes . for baseline scheme @xmath107 , we perform maximum ratio transmission for the artificial noise with respect to the virtual channel spanned by the idle users , i.e. , @xmath119 $ ] .",
    "then , we minimize the total transmit power by optimizing @xmath99 , the power of the artificial noise , and @xmath47 subject to constraints c1-c5 as in via sdp relaxation .",
    "baseline scheme @xmath120 has the same structure as baseline scheme @xmath107 except that the artificial noise is radiated isotropically .",
    "it can be observed that the two baseline schemes requires a significantly higher total transmit power than the proposed optimal scheme .",
    "indeed , the proposed optimal scheme fully utilizes the csi of all communication links and optimizes the space spanned by the artificial noise for providing secure and reliable communication . on the contrary ,",
    "the direction of the artificial noise signal is fixed in the two baseline schemes leading to a less effective jamming of the potential eavesdroppers and more severe si at the fd radio bs .",
    "( db ) , for different resource allocation schemes .",
    "the double - sided arrows indicate the power saving enabled by the propose optimal resource allocation scheme.,width=336 ]     ( db ) , for different resource allocation schemes.,width=336 ]      figure [ fig : cap_snr ] illustrates the average secrecy rate ( bit / s / hz ) versus the minimum required dl sinr , @xmath121 , for different resource allocation schemes and @xmath122 fd radio bs antennas .",
    "it can be seen that the average dl secrecy rate , i.e. , @xmath123 , increases with @xmath121 since the maximum tolerable sinrs of the idle users are constrained to be less than @xmath124 db . on the other hand , although the increased minimum required dl sinr leads to a higher si interference power impairing the ul signal detection , the total average secrecy rate for the ul communication still satisfies the minimum requirement and remains constant due to the proposed optimal resource allocation .",
    "besides , all considered schemes achieve the same secrecy rate",
    ". however , the proposed optimal scheme consumes much less power than the baseline schemes to achieve this secrecy rate , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : pt_sinr ] .",
    "the performance of dl and ul communication with a hd radio bs is not shown in this paper .",
    "in fact , a hd radio bs can not guarantee secure ul communication due to the lack of spatial degrees of freedom at each ul user for jamming with artificial noise .",
    "hence , the optimization problem for the hd radio bs corresponding to is always infeasible .",
    "in this paper , we formulated the joint power allocation and beamforming design for simultaneous dl and ul wireless communication via an fd radio bs as a non - convex optimization problem .",
    "the problem formulation took into account communication security for both dl and ul transmission and artificial noise injection at the fd radio bs .",
    "a power efficient sdp based resource allocation scheme was proposed to obtain the optimal solution for minimization of the weighted sum of the dl and ul transmit powers .",
    "simulation results unveiled the power savings enabled by optimization of the artificial noise covariance matrix . besides , we showed that unlike a hd bs , an fd bs can guarantee communication security for dl and ul users simultaneously",
    "it can be verified that the problem in ( [ eqn : sdp_relaxed ] ) is jointly convex with respect to the optimization variables and satisfies the slater s constraint qualification . as a result , the duality gap is zero and solving the dual problem is equivalent to solving the primal problem @xcite .",
    "hence , we start the proof by writing the lagrangian function of the primal problem in in terms of the beamforming matrix @xmath99 : @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the sets of primal and dual variables , respectively . @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the dual variables with respect to constraints c1 , c2 , c3 , and c6 in , respectively .",
    "@xmath130 denotes the collection of variables that are independent of @xmath99 . for convenience ,",
    "the optimal primal and dual variables of ( [ eqn : sdp_relaxed ] ) are denoted by the corresponding variables with an asterisk superscript .",
    "we focus on the following karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) optimality conditions : @xmath131 where @xmath132 in ( [ eqn : lagrangian_gradient ] ) is obtained by substituting the optimal dual variables @xmath133 into ( [ eqn : b_k ] ) . from ( [ eqn : kkt - complementarity ] )",
    ", we know that the optimal beamforming matrix @xmath134 is a rank - one matrix when @xmath135 . in particular , @xmath134 is required to lie in the null space spanned by @xmath136 for @xmath137 . as a result , by revealing the structure of @xmath136 , we can study the rank of beamforming matrix @xmath134 . in the following ,",
    "we first show by contradiction that @xmath138 is a positive definite matrix with probability one . to this end",
    ", we focus on the dual problem of ( [ eqn : sdp_relaxed ] ) . for a given set of optimal dual variables , @xmath139 , and a subset of optimal primal variables , @xmath140 , the dual problem of ( [ eqn : sdp_relaxed ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath141 suppose @xmath138 is negative semi - definite , i.e. , @xmath142 , then we can construct a beamforming matrix @xmath143 as one of the feasible solutions of ( [ eqn : dual2 ] ) , where @xmath144 is a scaling parameter and @xmath145 is the eigenvector corresponding to one of the non - positive eigenvalues of @xmath138 .",
    "we substitute @xmath143 into ( [ eqn : dual2 ] ) which yields @xmath146@xmath147 besides , by using a similar approach as in @xcite , it can be shown that constraint c1 is satisfied with equality for the optimal solution and thus @xmath148 . furthermore , since the channel vectors of the dl users , i.e. , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , are assumed to be statistically independent of the other channels in the system , we obtain @xmath151 for @xmath152 . thus , the dual optimal value becomes unbounded from below .",
    "yet , the optimal value of the primal problem in ( [ eqn : sdp_relaxed ] ) is non - negative which leads to a contradiction as strong duality would not hold .",
    "therefore , for the optimal solution , @xmath138 has to be a positive definite and full rank matrix with probability one , i.e. , @xmath153 .        where @xmath155 and @xmath156 are due to a basic rank inequality and ( [ eqn : lagrangian_gradient ] ) , respectively .",
