    "degeneracies in the energy spectra of quantum systems have close relationships with their symmetries .",
    "actually , von neumann and wigner showed that degeneracies are more likely to occur for the systems with one or more symmetries than those without symmetries  @xcite . to be more precise , if one assumes that a quantum system is given by a real hamiltonian matrix whose elements are expressed by independent parameters , in the case of no symmetry , two parameters happen to take some prescribed values in order to bring two of the eigenvalues into coincidence .",
    "their theory reminds us of the `` non - crossing rule '' in quantum chemistry , which states that energy levels of orbitals of the same symmetry can never cross each other along a reaction parameter .",
    "however , von neumann ",
    "wigner s theorem does not give a proof for the non - crossing rule .",
    "it is possible that degeneracies appear in the systems without symmetries .",
    "such degeneracies are referred to as accidental degeneracies .",
    "in fact some examples of accidental degeneracies are numerically observed in molecules  @xcite or triangular quantum billiards  @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional hubbard model is one of the most significant models in condensed matter physics .",
    "the model also attracts a great interest of mathematical physicists due to its bethe - ansatz solvability  @xcite .",
    "heilmann and lieb numerically investigated energy spectral flows along the interaction parameter @xmath0 for the system on a periodic 6-site chain and found many level crossings which can not be accounted for by the known symmetries such as translation , @xmath1 and particle - hole symmetries  @xcite .",
    "they concluded that , if one takes into account only @xmath0-independent symmetries , the level crossings are accidental degeneracies , that is , a counter example of the non - crossing rule .",
    "recently , yuzbashyan , altshuler and shastry have suggested that the origin of heilmann ",
    "lieb s level crossings should be dynamical symmetries in the hubbard model  @xcite . here",
    "the dynamical symmetries are given by parameter - dependent operators , which are often called higher conserved operators in association with conserved quantities in classical integrable systems .",
    "the dynamical symmetries for the hubbard model are constructed in  @xcite .",
    "yuzbashyan , altshuler and shastry numerically showed that crossings in the spectral flows of the first three conserved operators never occur at the same value of @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamical symmetries depend on the parameter @xmath0 , and they are not considered as symmetries in the von neumann  wigner s theorem .",
    "lieb s level crossings are still considered to be accidental degeneracies .    in the framework of the bethe ansatz",
    ", we discuss in the paper energy level crossings for the one - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "the bethe ansatz method provides information on the eigenstates that can not be easily obtained in the direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "we set up the following problems :    1 .",
    "when two energy eigenvalues approach in numerical data as one parameter is varied , one may draw two alternative spectral flows , a level crossing or level repulsion  @xcite . to ensure that genuine energy level crossings have happened",
    ", we must investigate the change of each eigenstate along the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "do the eigenstates have distinct dynamical symmetries at the level crossing points ? in order to solve the problem",
    "we assign each of the eigenstates the eigenvalues of the higher conserved operators .",
    "it is indeed not easy to investigate these problems . for the triangular quantum billiards with two parameters , berry and wilkinson investigated the behaviour of eigenstates along a circuit of the crossing point in the parameter space so that they could verify the existence of genuine energy level crossings  @xcite . for general quantum systems , it is hard in practice to construct quantum many - body eigenstates .",
    "the task is also not easy even for the systems that can be treated by the bethe ansatz .",
    "in fact , it is nontrivial to obtain numerical solutions to the bethe ansatz equations for a finite size system . for the sector of one",
    "down - spin , however , it is practically possible to solve the bethe ansatz equations numerically .    in the present paper ,",
    "we prove the existence of solutions to the lieb ",

    "we generalize the method of ref .",
    "@xcite . by using the numerical solutions ,",
    "we analyse the behaviour of each of the degenerate eigenstates along the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we thus find several genuine level crossings of energy spectral flows with the same @xmath0-independent symmetries .",
    "the merit of this method is that the numerical solutions for the lieb ",
    "wu equations provide not only the eigenvalues of the higher conserved operators but also the one - to - one correspondence between their spectral lines and eigenstates . as a consequence",
    ", we observe that all the common eigenspaces of the first three higher conserved operators are one - dimensional in the subspaces with the same @xmath0-independent symmetries .",
    "furthermore , when there are @xmath0-independent degeneracies ( permanent degeneracies ) in the spectral flow , the one - to - one correspondence plays an essential role in assigning to each of the degenerate eigenstates its eigenvalues of the dynamical symmetries at the energy level crossing points . by using the explicit form of the bethe ansatz wavefunctions  @xcite",
    ", we can derive the permanent degeneracies .",
    "we remark that the existence of level crossings also gives a necessary condition for algebraic independence of the three higher conserved operators in the subspaces .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first , in section  [ sec : symmetry - bethe ] , we summarize the known results for the hubbard model and prepare for the following sections .",
    "we list the known symmetries of the hubbard model in  [ sec : symmetries ] and review the bethe ansatz method in  [ sec : bam ] . in  [ sec : lw - eq_one - down ] we prove the existence of solutions for the lieb ",
    "wu equations with one down - spin following the approach developed in @xcite .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : crossings ] , we analyse degeneracies in the energy spectrum of the hubbard model by using both direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix and the bethe ansatz method . in  [ sec : twofold ] we describe twofold permanent degeneracies arising from a reflection symmetry of the lattice . in  [ sec:631 ] and",
    "[ sec:641 ] we investigate energy level crossings for the systems with two or three up - spins and one down - spin on a periodic 6-site chain .",
    "we find some genuine energy level crossings and see that the degenerate eigenstates can be classified by the eigenvalues of the higher conserved operators .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "we introduce the hubbard model on a one - dimensional periodic @xmath2-site chain .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be the creation and annihilation operators of electrons satisfying @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and define the number operators by @xmath7 .",

    "they all commute with the hamiltonian  , which leads to the symmetry of type @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore it is known that this @xmath21 symmetry lifts to the @xmath1 group symmetry .",
    "for the later discussion , we define casimir operators , @xmath22 which commute with all the operators in  .",
    "next we introduce the dynamical symmetries given by the @xmath0-dependent operators .",

    "we numerically calculate the solutions @xmath127 and @xmath128 for @xmath129 .",
    "let us review von neumann  wigner s discussion on the spectra of quantum systems .",
    "we assume that a hamiltonian is described by a finite - dimensional real symmetric matrix whose elements are regarded as random independent parameters .",
    "if the system has no symmetry , we call its spectra a `` pure sequence '' . if there exist some symmetries in the system , its spectra is given by a superposition of pure sequences , which we call a `` mixed sequence '' .",
    "von neumann ",
    "wigner s theorem reads as follows : one must adjust two parameters to bring two of the eigenvalues belonging to a pure sequence into coincidence while in a mixed sequence one obtain a degeneracy by varying only one parameter  @xcite .",
    "hence the degeneracies in pure sequences are very unlikely to be found if we choose the values of parameters in an arbitrary manner .",
    "such degeneracies in pure sequences are referred to as accidental degeneracies .    applying the above discussion , we study the hubbard model . in varying the parameter @xmath0",
    ", the hamiltonian   gives a flow in the above space of parameters .",
    "as we have mentioned in the previous section , the system has several symmetries .",
    "since the operators @xmath130 are mutually commutative , they can be simultaneously diagonalized by an orthogonal transformation . through the same orthogonal transformation , the hamiltonian matrix breaks up into diagonal blocks corresponding to the common eigenspaces of @xmath130 .",
    "notice that the common eigenspaces are characterized by the set of quantum numbers @xmath131 .",
    "energy eigenvalues from the blocks with different quantum numbers may degenerate due to translation and @xmath1 symmetries .",
    "but all the blocks do not give a pure sequence ; for example , the blocks with @xmath132 have particle - hole and spin reversal symmetries .",
    "however , after considering all the known @xmath0-independent symmetries , the spectra also have many degeneracies at special values of @xmath0 , i.e. , level crossings in the spectral flows along the parameter @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "thus the flow determined by the hamiltonian   runs through several special values of parameters that give accidental degeneracies .",
    "let us discuss how to numerically determine level crossings , in particular , for the case of accidental degeneracies .",
    "one notices that the numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian is not enough to find crossings of energy spectral flows since apparent crossings may be just close approaches of two eigenvalues  @xcite . to verify the existence of genuine level crossings , we must investigate the behaviour of spectral flows for each eigenstate .",
    "the bethe ansatz method is a very effective tool to establish this .",
    "here we restrict our investigation to the systems with one down - spin where we have shown the existence of solutions for the lieb ",
    "wu equations   in subsection  [ sec : lw - eq_one - down ] .",
    "we have seen in subsection  [ sec : symmetries ] that the hubbard model has the dynamical symmetries in addition to the @xmath0-independent symmetries .",
    "the recent paper  @xcite pointed out that the degenerate eigenstates at the accidental degeneracies observed in @xcite can be classified by the eigenvalues of the higher conserved operators .",
    "we verify their assertion at the level of eigenstates in the sector of one down - spin . here",
    "we note that the degeneracies discussed in @xcite are in the half - filled hubbard model with zero magnetization , that is , in the sector of three down - spins .",
    "the strategy in the present paper is given by the following :    * we give a matrix representation of the hamiltonian in a certain common eigenspace of the operators @xmath130 , which is referred to as desymmetrization of the corresponding symmetries .",
    "we numerically give its eigenvalues from the direct diagonalization  @xcite for several values of @xmath0 .",
    "* we give the numerical solutions of the lieb ",
    "wu equations   in several values of @xmath0 . from the correspondence between",
    "energy spectral flows and the bethe states , we verify whether or not genuine energy level crossings exist .",
    "* we also diagonalize other conserved operators @xmath133 and see the correspondence between their spectral flows and the bethe states .",
    "we analyse the structure of their degeneracies .",
    "we discuss only the systems containing two or three up - spins and one down - spin , which do not have particle - hole and spin reversal symmetries . in spite of such restriction",
    ", we have some non - trivial results on degeneracies .      the translation and the @xmath1 symmetries produce @xmath0-independent degeneracies in energy spectral flows .",
    "we call @xmath0-independent degeneracies permanent degeneracies . furthermore ,",
    "after the desymmetrization of these @xmath0-independent symmetries , we often observe another twofold permanent degeneracies associated with a reflection symmetry of the lattice  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we can explain them in terms of the bethe ansatz wavefunction .",
    "here we note that , due to the relation @xmath134 , the reflection operator @xmath13 acts only on the eigenspaces of @xmath14 with the eigenvalue @xmath135 or @xmath136 , that is , the subspaces of the fock space with the total momentum @xmath137 or @xmath138 .",

    "even in the subspaces with @xmath137 or @xmath138 , the bethe states do not always diagonalize the operator @xmath13 .",
    "indeed it is easy to verify that , if we apply the operator @xmath13 to one of the eigenvectors @xmath139 , then its total momentum and eigenvalues of @xmath140 are negated and those of @xmath141 do not change since @xmath142=[\\sigma,\\eta_{z,\\pm}]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these facts are verified more directly from the following relation : @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "note that , if @xmath44 is a solution for the lieb ",
    "wu equations  , then so is @xmath146 .",
    "the relation   means that , if the set @xmath147 does not coincide with @xmath148 as a set , we have a twofold permanent degeneracy in energy spectral flows . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath149 as a set , then the eigenstates @xmath139 have the eigenvalue @xmath150 for the second conserved operator @xmath46 , which follows from the formulas in .",
    "it should be noted that , to see the existence of such twofold permanent degeneracies , we must solve the lieb ",
    "wu equations  .",
    "we now study the system with two up - spins and one down - spin on benzene ( @xmath151 ) . note that @xmath152 and @xmath153 in this case .",

    "we put @xmath156 and numerically diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix for several values of @xmath157 .",
    "figure [ fig : e1 - 631 ] shows the energy spectral flows for @xmath158 . here",
    "the vertical line in the figure indicates the energy @xmath159 divided by @xmath160 .",
    "we confirm from the numerical data that there is no permanent degeneracy .",
    "we observe a close approach of two energy levels in @xmath161 , which seems to be an energy level crossing .",
    "our first purpose is to show that a genuine energy level crossing has been found in figure [ fig : e1 - 631 ] . in the case of triangular quantum billiards  @xcite ,",
    "topological properties of their eigenstates were studied to verify the existence of energy level crossings . here",
    "we employ the bethe ansatz method to verify energy level crossings in the level of eigenstates .",
    "it is clear that , since @xmath162 and @xmath163 , all the eigenstates in the subspace are the bethe states characterized by the indices @xmath126 satisfying . by using the procedure in subsection [ sec : lw - eq_one - down ] ,",
    "we numerically give real wavenumber solutions with @xmath164 and @xmath32-@xmath84-two - string solutions with @xmath165 to calculate the corresponding energy eigenvalues .",

    "thus , by combining the results in figure [ fig : e1 - 631 ] with those on table [ tab : t1 - 631 ] , we obtain the behaviour of energy spectral flows for each eigenstate .",
    "we conclude that , in @xmath161 , there exists an energy level crossing between two bethe states indexed by @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "next we show that , if we take into account dynamical symmetries , each one - dimensional component of the degenerate eigenstates at the energy level crossing point can be distinguished from the other degenerate eigenstates . in the similar way to the energy eigenvalues ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the second conserved operator @xmath46 are obtained by both their direct diagonalization and the solutions of the lieb ",
