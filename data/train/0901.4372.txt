    "the current standard model of structure formation is successful in explaining various cosmological observations , such as the cosmic microwave background @xcite , the clustering pattern of galaxies @xcite , the ly@xmath7 forest fluctuations in the intergalactic medium @xcite , and the abundance of clusters of galaxies @xcite . in the theory ,",
    "the growth of structure is driven by the gravitational instability of dark matter .",
    "the initial density fluctuations are nearly scale - invariant and gaussian , as inferred from the cosmic microwave background observations ( e , g .",
    "the spectrum of the fluctuation , together with the `` cold '' ansatz of dark matter , suggests that astronomical objects form through the bottom - up assembly process .",
    "clusters of galaxies serve as one of the most important tests of the standard structure formation model .",
    "clusters are the largest virialized objects in the universe .",
    "their high virial temperatures suggest that most of baryon remain hot in massive clusters and dissipative cooling of baryons is less efficient .",
    "therefore , the density profile of clusters can well be approximated by the distribution of dark matter which is sensitive to both the nature of dark matter and the dark matter assemble history . in the standard collisionless cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "scenario , the density profile of dark matter found in @xmath3-body simulations has a universal form with its slope progressively shallower toward the center ( * ? ? ?",

    "cluster - scale halos are predicted to have rather low - concentration mass profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these are important theoretical predictions that should be confronted with observations .",
    "gravitational lensing is suited for this purpose , because it probes the distribution of matter directly , regardless of the light distribution .",
    "weak gravitational lensing , which takes advantage of small distortions of background galaxies to reconstruct the mass distribution , is particularly powerful in extracting outer mass profiles of massive clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "strong lensing provides robust measurements of cluster masses near the center .",
    "therefore , it is essential to combine strong and weak lensing analysis in order to constrain density profiles over a wide range of radii @xcite .",
    "cluster mass profiles grow in importance , particularly given possible high concentrations found in some lens - rich clusters .",
    "@xcite argued that the radial mass profile of abell 1689 ( a1689 ) from combined strong and weak lensing analysis appears to be significantly more centrally concentrated than expected from @xmath3-body simulations of dark matter ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "such high concentrations have also been suggested in other lensing clusters , such as cl0024 @xcite and ms2137 @xcite .",
    "a possible resolution is to consider a triaxial cluster with its major axis aligned with the line - of - sight direction @xcite . because of the lensing bias that lens - rich clusters are more likely to be oriented with the major axis @xcite , the high concentration of a1689 can in practice be marginally reconciled with the @xmath4cdm predictions @xcite .",
    "the broad range of apparent concentrations expected in the @xmath4cdm model , both from the intrinsic scatter of concentrations and from additional scatter due to the projection effect , indicates the need for the statistical study of concentrations using a well - controlled sample of lensing clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "all the magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations were conducted for three of the four clusters studied in this paper .",
    "sdss1446 , sdss1531 , and sdss2111 were observed with the frederick c. gillett telescope ( gemini north ) between the months of 2008 february and 2008 july .",
    "the primary goal of the spectroscopic observations was to obtain redshifts of arcs to facilitate strong lensing modeling .",
    "we briefly summarize the spectroscopy here , and refer the reader to hennawi et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ) for additional details .",
    "all spectroscopic observations were carried out using the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; * ? ? ?",

    "custom slitmasks were designed and arcs were targeted based on their colors in the deep subaru imaging . after targeting all of the arc candidates , any remaining slits were placed on cluster members , easily identified by their red sequence colors .",
    "spectra were taken with the r150_g5306 grating in first order which gives a dispersion of @xmath25   per pixel , with six pixels per resolution element resulting in a spectral fwhm@xmath26 .",
    "although the r150 grating offers broad spectral range from the atmospheric cutoff to @xmath27 , the drop in sensitivity at the blue and red extremes , due both to the gmos ccd and the r150 grating efficiency , results in effective spectral coverage of @xmath28 .",
    "our exposure times were 2400  sec resulting in 1200  sec effective integration for each of the two submasks .",
    "three exposures were taken for each target .",
    "thus if an arc was targeted on both submasks ( typical for the most promiminent arcs ) the total integration time was 7200  sec .",

    "figure  [ fig : img ] presents the _ subaru _ suprime - cam images of the central regions of the clusters .",
    "as shown in @xcite , these clusters exhibit clear giant arcs .",
    "we identify multiple images based on their colors , redshifts , and also iteratively by building preliminary mass models of the clusters . for a1703",
    ", we adopt the identification and spectroscopic redshifts of arcs reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the redshifts of giant arcs of sdss1531 were successfully measured with the _ gemini _ telescope .",
    "although we could not measure the redshift of the lensed blue images in sdss1446 from our _ gemini _ spectrum , the absence of [ oii ] 3727 emission line ( which should be detected for blue , actively star - forming galaxies like this ) and the brightness of the arc in the @xmath20-band image suggests that the redshift should be in the range @xmath29 ( hennawi et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "we adopt this redshift range in our mass modeling .",
    "since the spectrum of the giant arc of sdss2111 was inconclusive , we conservatively assume its redshift to be @xmath30 based on the @xmath31 color .",
    "although some additional possible multiply imaged systems are identified in some of these clusters , we conservatively restrict our analysis to those image systems where lensing hypothesis is completely unambiguous .",
    "we summarize the locations and redshifts of the multiply imaged systems for strong lens modeling in table  [ tab : strong ] .",
    "we model the dark matter distribution in each clusters by the nfw profile : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a characteristic density and @xmath34 is a scale radius . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt the virial overdensity @xmath35 to compute the virial mass @xmath36 and virial radius @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mean matter density of the universe at redshift @xmath40 .",
    "the nonlinear overdensity @xmath41 is calculated at each @xmath40 in a standard way using the spherical collapse model .",
    "the concentration parameter @xmath42 of the model is defined by @xmath43 thus clusters with larger values of @xmath42 are more centrally concentrated .",
    "@xmath3-body simulations based on the @xmath4cdm model predict that concentration parameters depend on halo masses and redshifts ; for massive clusters , they are typically @xmath44 at @xmath45 and evolve with the redshift as @xmath46 with @xmath47 @xcite .    to compute lensing properties , we first project the spherical nfw profile ( eq . [ [ eq : nfw ] ] ) onto a two - dimensional lens plane .",
    "next we include an ellipticity @xmath48 by replacing the radius @xmath49 in the projected mass density to @xmath50 .",
    "then we allow an arbitrary position angle @xmath51 by rotating the projected mass density .",
    "the lensing deflection angle for our mass profile is computed using the method described in @xcite .",
    "since the ellipticity is introduced in the surface mass density rather than the lens potential , our model does not suffer from unphysical mass distributions ( such as dumbell - like isodensity contours and negative mass densities ) , which may be seen in the case of elliptical lens potentials ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we also include member galaxies in our mass modeling .",
    "the total mass distribution of each member galaxy is modeled by the pseudo-@xcite model which has the three - dimensional radial profile of @xmath52 , i.e. , the isothermal model with the truncation at @xmath53 .",
    "we identify red member galaxies in the color - magnitude ( @xmath54 versus @xmath21 ) diagram and include @xmath55 brightest member galaxies for the mass model of each cluster .",
    "we fix the locations , ellipticities , and position angles of the members to those measured in the _ subaru _ suprime - cam data .",
    "note that including the central galaxies is important for accurate estimates of dark matter core masses , as their effects on strong lensing can be significant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the effect of other member galaxies is rather minor , but they can be important in accurately reproducing positions of some lensed images .    to reduce the number of parameters , we adopt the exact scaling relations for the velocity dispersions @xmath56 and cutoff radii @xmath53 of member galaxies following @xcite , who constrained the mass distribution around cluster elliptical galaxies using detailed strong and weak lensing models .",
    "specifically , we assume that they scale as @xmath57 ( faber - jackson relation ) and @xmath58 ( corresponding to a constant mass - to - light ratio ) , where @xmath59 is a total @xmath21-band luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "we apply this scaling relation to all member galaxies including the bcg of the cluster .",
    "to avoid unrealistically massive member galaxies , we add a gaussian prior to the normalization of the scaling for the velocity dispersion , which is estimated using the correlation with the magnitude @xcite , but we adopt a conservative @xmath60 error so that a wide range of mass models are allowed .",
    "we also estimate the normalization of the scaling for the cutoff radius by that inferred from observations , @xmath61  kpc ( where we fix @xmath56 in this relation to the mean normalization of the gaussian prior on @xmath56 ) @xcite , but again allow @xmath53 to be gaussian - distributed with a @xmath62 error which crudely models the uncertainty of this relation in observations .",
    "finding multiple images for a given source position requires intensive search in the image plane .",
    "this is time - consuming , even if we adopt adaptive - mesh refinement scheme to improve grid resolutions only near the critical curves , preventing us from exploring a large parameter space in a reasonable time scale . instead , in this paper we evaluate @xmath63 in the source plane to speed up ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the magnification tensor for observed @xmath22-th image , @xmath66 are the source position computed from the position of the @xmath22-th image , and @xmath67 is the best - fit source position which can be found analytically ( see * ? ? ?",
    "since the magnification tensor is nothing but a mapping from the source plane to the image plane , @xmath68 approximates the distance between observed and predicted image positions in the image plane ; indeed , we confirmed that this source plane @xmath63 is reasonably accurate at around our best - fit models , compared with the standard image plane @xmath63 .",
    "note that this approach automatically ignores any extra images .",
    "an important parameter here is the positional uncertainty in the image plane , @xmath69 , which is directly related with errors on best - fit model parameters .",
    "while the measurement error was sufficiently small , comparable to the pixel scale of the image ( @xmath70 ) , it has been known that multiple images can be fitted only with @xmath71 accuracy for some massive lensing clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , presumably because of complex nature of cluster mass distributions",
    ". thus , in this paper we assume the positional error of @xmath72 ( image plane ) for all multiple images .",
    "we explore the multi - dimensional @xmath63 surface using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach .",
    "we adopt a standard metropolis - hastings sampling with the multivariate - gaussian as a proposal distribution . during the sampling ,",
    "the range of the virial mass is restricted to @xmath73 , and that of the concentration parameter to @xmath74 .",
    "we then derive constraints on parameters by projecting the likelihood distributions to the parameter space .",
    "mass modeling is performed using the software _ glafic _ ( m. oguri , in preparation ) .",
    "results of our strong lens modeling are summarized in table  [ tab : slmodel ] , and the critical curves of the best - fit models are displayed in figure  [ fig : img ] .",
    "first , we find that our best - fit models successfully reproduce the multiple images with reduced chi - squares of @xmath75 , which suggests that our assumption of the positional error of @xmath76 was reasonable .",
    "second , strong lensing constrains the center of the dark halo component quite well with a typical error of an arcsecond , and the best - fit dark halo center is close to the position of the bcg .",
    "an exception is sdss2111 for which the offset of the center of the dark halo from the bcg is large , @xmath77 ( see below ) .",
    "third , it is found that the virial mass @xmath36 and concentration parameter @xmath42 are not constrained very well .",
    "in fact this is expected , because multiple images of a source redshift mainly constrain the mass enclosed by the arcs , which is sensitive both to @xmath36 and @xmath42 .",
    "fourth , we find that relatively large ellipticities of @xmath78 are required to fit the images .",
    "an exception is sdss1531 for which the mass distribution appears to be rather circular , @xmath79 , although an ellipticity as high as @xmath80 is allowed .",
    "these large ellipticities are in fact broadly consistent with @xmath4cdm predictions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our best - fit mass model of a1703 from strong lensing ( see also appendix  [ sec : gnfw ] ) appears to be in reasonable agreement with earlier work @xcite .",
    "for example , best - fit ellipticity and position angle of dark halo component , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , agree well with the result of @xcite , the ellipticity in the lens potential of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for the relation between @xmath85 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "moreover , we find that the structure of the critical curve of a1703 is consistent with those found in the earlier work .",
    "it is worth noting that the central ring ( a1a4 ) represents a rare example of lensing by a hyperbolic umbilic catastrophe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "see @xcite for more comprehensive discussions about the central ring as a hyperbolic umbilic catastrophe .",
    "one of the most important quantities that are well constrained by strong lensing is the einstein radius , @xmath86 .",
    "we obtain constraints on @xmath86 at the redshifts of the arcs from our strong lens modeling as follows . for all the mcmc samples we estimate the einstein radii of the dark halo ( nfw ) components by forcing @xmath87 and calculating the radii of the outer critical curves predicted by the dark halo components alone . with azimuthally averaged radial profiles of elliptical dark halo components , and found that they agree with each other at @xmath883% level , which is negligibly small compared with statistical errors .",
    "thus the procedure adopted in this paper does not involve any significant systematics . ]",
    "thus the contribution of cluster member galaxies including the central galaxy is removed in our estimate of @xmath86 , suggesting that the value could in fact be smaller than observed distances of lensed images from the center .",
    "we emphasize that this quantity serves as a useful strong lens constraint when combined with weak lensing results , particularly because we are interested in the radial profile of the dark matter component , rather than the total matter including stars which dominate at the very center of clusters ( see  [ sec : s+w ] ) .",
    "the derived constraints on @xmath86 are shown in table  [ tab : slein ] . since multiple strong lens systems with different redshifts are available for a1703 , for this particular cluster we derive einstein radii at two different source redshifts , @xmath89 ( the redshift of arc a1@xmath0a5 ) and @xmath90 ( the redshift of arc b1@xmath0b3 and c1@xmath0c3 ) .",
    "we regard these two einstein radii as statistically independent , which is reasonable given the large difference of @xmath86 between these two redshifts .    here",
    "we briefly discuss the mass model of sdss2111 , which appears to exhibit the large offset between the lens potential center and the location of the bcg ( see figure  [ fig : img ] ; the best - fit lens potential center corresponds to the center of the inner critical curve ) .",
    "we find that no acceptable lens model has the offset smaller than @xmath91 .",
    "the offset is required because the center of curvature of the long bright arc is clearly displaced from the bcg . however , as seen in table  [ tab : slmodel ] , the current data do not constrain the center of the dark halo ( nfw ) component very well , which is the main reason that @xmath86 involve relatively large errors .",
    "thus it is important to improve the strong lens constraints by adding more multiply imaged systems .",
    "we derive weak lensing shear signals following the algorithm outlined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ksb ) .",
    "first , for each cluster we reprocess _ subaru _ suprime - cam @xmath21-band images through imcat to compute shapes of each objects . in order to compute shapes accurately ,",
    "we iteratively refine the centroid of each object . during the process objects with offsets in each iteration larger than 3  pixel are removed .",
    "the ellipticities @xmath92 of objects are measured from the weighted quadruple moments of the surface brightnesses .",
    "we select stars for point spread function ( psf ) correction in a standard way by identifying the stellar branch in the magnitude versus half light radius @xmath93 plane .",
    "we apply an additional cut , the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath94 and the ellipticity @xmath95 , to construct a final sample of template stars for the psf correction .",
    "we correct ellipticities of objects using the sample of stars as reference @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the smear polarizability tensor and @xmath98 is the psf anisotropy kernel estimated from the template stars ( hereafter the superscript @xmath99 denotes quantities measured for template stars ) . following @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we obtain a smooth map of @xmath100 by first dividing the whole image into @xmath101 chunks and fit @xmath100 in each chunk using second - order bi - polynomials with iterative 3@xmath56-clipping rejections .",
    "we show ellipticities of the template stars before and after the psf correction in figure  [ fig : ell2d ] and table  [ tab : wl ] .",
    "the figure demonstrates that our procedure successfully reduces psf anisotropies over the entire field .",
    "residual stellar ellipticities after the psf correction are comparable to those in other weak lensing studies using _ subaru _ suprime - cam images @xcite .    next we correct the isotropic smearing effect to estimate weak lensing shear .",
    "the pre - seeing shear polarizability @xmath102 relates observed galaxy ellipticities with their true values , and is calculated as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the shear polarizability tensor .",
    "since the measurement of @xmath102 for each galaxy is extremely noisy , we approximate @xmath102 as @xmath105 times an identity matrix with @xcite : @xmath106 here we use a smooth map of @xmath107 constructed by fitting them as a function of the position , with a fifth - order polynomial over the entire template stars .",
    "we then derive the reduced shear @xmath108 for each object as @xmath109 we use raw , unsmoothed @xmath105 because the smoothing does not necessarily improve the shear estimate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we include the calibration correction factor @xmath110 since the ksb algorithm with the scalar correction scheme for @xmath102 has been known to underestimate shears by @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "we confirmed that our shear estimate procedure , together with the source galaxy selection described in  [ sec : wlsrc ] , recovers lensing shears in the simulated _ subaru _ suprime - cam images of the shear testing programme 2 ( step2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) quite well , with typically a few percent of the shear - calibration bias ( parameter @xmath112 ) and an order of magnitude smaller residual shear offset ( parameter @xmath113 ) .",
    "the background galaxy selection is crucial for weak lensing analysis .",
    "we choose following galaxies for weak lensing analysis ; ( 1 ) no close companions at distances within 10  pixels , ( 2 ) the half light radius @xmath93 larger than @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the median of the half light radii of template stars used for the psf correction , ( 3 ) the half - light radius @xmath93 smaller than 10  pixels , ( 4 ) the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath116 , ( 5 ) the pre - seeing shear polarizability @xmath117 , and ( 6 ) the shear value @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , we apply magnitude and color cuts , as we will discuss below .",
    "an appropriate color selection is important to minimize the dilution effect by cluster member galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one way to avoid contaminations from cluster members is to use galaxies redder than the red sequence of the cluster or bluest galaxies . in this paper",
    "we adopt blue galaxies , because our clusters are located at moderately high redshifts ( @xmath119 ) and hence very few red background galaxies are available .",
    "specifically , we use galaxies with @xmath120 ( measured in aperture magnitudes ) for our weak lensing analysis .",
    "this is much bluer than red - sequence galaxies ( @xmath121 for @xmath122 ) , suggesting that the dilution effect is not significant for our source galaxy samples .",
    "we now estimate the depths of our galaxy sample for weak lensing analysis .",
    "a key quantity here is the mean lensing depth averaged over the population of source galaxies : @xmath123 with @xmath124 and @xmath125 being angular diameter distances from the lens to the source and from the observer to the source , respectively .",
    "the pdf @xmath126 denotes the redshift distribution of the source galaxy sample , which is particularly important in our study because of relatively high redshifts of the clusters .    to estimate @xmath126",
    ", we adopt a photometric redshift sample of galaxies in the canada - france hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) presented by @xcite .",
    "the idea is that we apply our color and magnitude cuts to the cfhtls galaxy sample , which is well calibrated by the large amount of photometric and spectroscopic data , to infer the redshift distribution in our _ subaru _ galaxy sample .",
    "first , we compare the number counts of galaxies with @xmath120 between the cfhtls and our source galaxy samples .",
    "figure  [ fig : wei ] shows the relative weight as a function of total @xmath21-band magnitudes , @xmath127 , i.e. , the number ratio of the source galaxies and cfhtls galaxies .",
    "sharp declines at @xmath128 imply that the effect of our background galaxy selections is significant beyond this magnitude .",
    "we therefore use galaxies with total @xmath21-band magnitudes @xmath129 for our weak lensing analysis , where @xmath130 is chosen so that the relative weight becomes approximately 0.3 ( see table  [ tab : zs ] for exact values ) .",
    "next we estimate the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of redshifts for our background samples @xmath126 as @xmath131 where the summations run over all cfhtls galaxies with @xmath120 and @xmath129 , and @xmath132 is the pdfs of photometric redshifts for individual cfhtls galaxies @xcite . with this pdf , we estimate the lensing depths @xmath133 from equation ( [ eq : lensdepth ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab : zs ] summarizes the mean depths of our source galaxy sample .",
    "we also compute the effective source redshift @xmath134 that is defined by the redshift at which the distance ratio @xmath135 becomes equal to the mean distance ratio @xmath136 ; in most situations of weak lensing analyses we can simply assume that all the source galaxies lie at @xmath137 .",
    "however , since the reduced shear @xmath108 is not exactly proportional to @xmath135 , adopting a common redshift for all background galaxies in fact underpredicts values of @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "thus , in computing expected @xmath138 for a given mass model we fully take account of the redshift distribution of background galaxies @xmath126 instead of adopting the effective source redshift @xmath134 .",
    "the resulting numbers of background galaxies are @xmath139 ( surface number density of @xmath140 ) , except sdss1531 for which the number of source galaxies is much smaller , @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) , because of the worse seeing size of the image .",
    "the reason for the relatively small number density compared with the expected number density of @xmath143 for _ subaru _ weak lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is our color cut to eliminate the dilution effect .",
    "in fact , the number density is comparable to other _",
    "cluster weak lensing studies which adopted similar color cuts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "before studying radial profiles , we check two - dimensional mass ( convergence ) distributions reconstructed from weak lensing shears using an inversion algorithm of @xcite . here",
    "we assume weak lensing limit ( @xmath144 , i.e. , @xmath145 ) , which suggests that the reconstructed @xmath146 will be slightly overestimated in the cores of clusters .",
    "we use these two - dimensional mass maps only to study the morphology of the cluster ; we constrain cluster mass distributions using radial profiles of tangential shears ( see  [ sec : rsh ] ) .",
    "we also derive luminosity density maps of red - sequence galaxies for comparison .",
    "we show gaussian - smoothed ( @xmath147 ) maps of all four clusters in figure  [ fig : twod_kappa ] . in all the clusters ,",
    "weak lensing signals are clearly detected .",
    "in addition , we find that the reconstructed mass distributions well trace the spatial distributions of red - sequence galaxies , with roughly similar mass and light centroids . the clusters exhibit deviations from circular mass distributions , in particular for a1703 .",
    "the umidordal structure with aligned position angles of weak lensing , the light distribution , and strong lensing ( see the critical curve shown in figure  [ fig : img ] ) implies that the cluster a1703 is quite relaxed . for sdss1531",
    ", we find a probable secondary peak at the @xmath148 northwest of the cluster center , implying that the cluster may not yet be relaxed .",
    "the position angles of mass distributions from strong and weak lensing appear to agree .",
    "several subpeaks and non - regular morphology of sdss2111 suggest that this cluster is not relaxed either .",
    "however , sdss2111 again shows agreement between weak and strong lensing in that the isodensity contours appear to be elongated in the north - south direction .",
    "in addition , the centroid of the mass distribution is slightly offset north of the bcg , which is consistent with the result of strong lens modeling .",
    "it is important to obtain x - ray data for these clusters to explore their dynamical states further .      for each cluster",
    "we derive an azimuthally averaged one - dimensional shear profile to obtain constraints on the cluster mass profiles .",
    "the center of each cluster is fixed to the center of the dark halo component determined from strong lens modeling ( see table  [ tab : slmodel ] ) . for a given center",
    ", we can calculate the tangential shear @xmath149 and the @xmath150 rotated component @xmath151 from the reduced shear @xmath152 as follows : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the polar angle .",
    "we obtain @xmath149 and @xmath151 for each radial bin by simply averaging these shears of individual source galaxies without weighting .",
    "we estimate the mean and error using a jackknife resampling technique .",
    "the shear profiles are computed in the range of radii @xmath155 $ ] with a bin size of @xmath156 .",
    "thus we have seven radial bins in total .    in figure",
    "[ fig : profile_gamma ] , we plot radial profiles of @xmath149 and @xmath151 of all the four clusters .",
    "we detect weak lensing signals significantly up to @xmath157 from the cluster center . on the other hand , @xmath151 is consistent with a null signal , as expected for shears produced by gravitational lensing of clusters .",
    "we fit the tangential shear profile by the nfw profile ( eq . [ [ eq : nfw ] ] ) with the virial mass @xmath36 and concentration parameters @xmath42 as free parameters . for this , we adopt the following @xmath63 : @xmath158 ^ 2}{\\sigma_i^2 } , \\label{eq : c2wl}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 and @xmath160 denote observed tangential shear and its error for @xmath22-th radial bin . as shown in figure  [ fig : profile_gamma ] , the nfw model provides reasonable fits to the data .",
    "the best - fit model parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : swmodel ] .",
    "in this section , we combine results from strong lensing (  [ sec : slens ] ) and weak lensing (  [ sec : wlens ] ) to constrain the radial mass profiles over a wide range of radii .",
    "we do so simply by summing up the chi - squares : @xmath161 where the weak lensing constraint @xmath162 is from equation ( [ eq : c2wl ] ) .",
    "although we can in principle use strong lens constraints obtained from detailed fitting of image positions in  [ sec : slens ] , here we choose a conservative approach to adopt only the einstein radius as our strong lens constraint .",
    "specifically , @xmath163 is computed as @xmath164 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{\\rm ein}^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath165 and @xmath166 are the einstein radius and its errors listed in table  [ tab : slein ] .",
    "we include the asymmetry of errors on @xmath165 by using different values of @xmath166 between @xmath167 and @xmath168 . for sdss1446 and sdss2111 ,",
    "only the allowed range of the redshift of the arcs ( and hence the redshift of the einstein radius , @xmath169 ) was given ; therefore , for these clusters we assume a flat prior @xmath170 ( sdss1446 ) or @xmath171 ( sdss2111 ) and marginalize @xmath163 over @xmath172 to derive strong lens constraints .",
    "we note that the contribution of stars ( member galaxies and the bcgs ) , which can be significant at strong lensing regime , is excluded in estimating @xmath86 from strong lens modeling .",
    "thus the derived radial profile should be considered as that for the sum of dark matter and intracluster gas rather than the total matter profile .",
    "we show the constraints in the @xmath36-@xmath42 plane in figure  [ fig : cont ] . as expected , adding strong lensing significantly improve constraints on these parameters , especially the concentration parameter @xmath42 , although this is not the case for sdss2111 because of the unknown arc redshift and the relatively large error on @xmath86 .",
    "constraints from strong and weak lensing are consistent with each other , except a1703 for which the best - fit models slightly differ .",
    "we list the best - fit model parameters in table  [ tab : swmodel ] .",
    "it is found that the radial profiles are fitted well by the nfw profile with @xmath173 .    to see how strong and weak lensing probe different radii , we plot radial profiles of convergence @xmath146 from lensing observations and best - fit models in figure  [ fig : profile_kappa ] . we derive convergence at each radial bin from weak lensing shears by using the following relation : @xmath174=\\frac{2}{\\theta^2 } \\int_0^\\theta\\theta'\\kappa(\\theta')d\\theta'-\\kappa(\\theta).\\ ] ] we need a boundary condition in order to solve this equation .",
    "we fix @xmath146 in the outermost bin to the value computed from the nfw profile with best - fit parameter values from weak lensing data alone .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for practical procedures to compute @xmath146 from discrete @xmath149 data . as clearly shown in the figure , strong lensing probes radii roughly an order of magnitude smaller than those constrained by weak lensing .",
    "hence by combining strong and weak lensing we can constrain the density profile of the cluster over 2  dex in radius .",
    "we find that the model that fits weak lensing data of a1703 underpredicts convergence in the core of the cluster ; the einstein radius of a1703 implies more centrally concentrated profile of a1703 than expected from weak lensing data alone .",
    "for the other three clusters , convergence profiles from weak lensing alone and strong and weak lensing agree quite well .",
    "however , strong lensing data do narrow down the allowed range of radial profiles , as is clear from figure  [ fig : cont ] .",
    "we now compare our result of a1703 with the combined strong and weak lensing analysis by @xcite .",
    "we find that the best - fit virial masses are consistent with each other , but the concentration parameter of our best - fit model , @xmath175 , differs from their best - fit value , @xmath176 at @xmath177 level .",
    "we ascribe the difference to the larger einstein radius they assumed , @xmath178 for @xmath179 .",
    "indeed , our best - fit model predicts @xmath180 for @xmath179 , which appears more consistent with the locations of lensed arcs in a1703 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "one of our main interests lies in the possible excess of the concentration parameter @xmath42 found among lensing clusters .",
    "here we compare our results with theoretical predictions based on the @xmath4cdm model .    for the theoretical prediction , we adopt results of @xmath3-body simulations in the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) 5-year cosmology @xcite .",
    "they derived the mean concentration of dark halos as a function of halo mass and redshift as @xmath181 the apparent concentration parameters for halos with given mass and redshift are significantly scattered , with approximately the log - normal distribution with @xmath182 .",
    "however , the diversity of the halo population found in @xmath3-body simulations suggest that clusters with giant arcs should represent a quite biased population .",
    "this lensing bias arises from the fact that the lensing cross section is a sensitive function of the halo concentration . therefore we expect projected mass distributions of lensing clusters to be more centrally concentrated than ordinary clusters , implying that the clusters are intrinsically more concentrated and/or their major axes are preferentially aligned with the line - of - sight , giving rise to apparently more concentrated distributions of projected surface mass densities .",
    "@xcite estimated the lensing clusters have @xmath183 higher values of concentrations compared with normal clusters ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite focused on clusters with larger einstein radii and argued that such clusters have @xmath184 higher concentrations .",
    "based on these discussions , in this paper we consider @xmath62 enhancement of @xmath42 due to the lensing bias .",
    "note that the lensing bias includes the projection effect from the halo triaxiality . from the calculation of @xcite",
    ", it is also found that the apparent concentration of the lensing clusters has slightly smaller scatter with @xmath185 .",
    "figure  [ fig : clupar ] shows the distribution of @xmath42 of the four clusters we study in this paper as well as several lensing clusters studied before .",
    "we consider only clusters whose radial profiles are well constrained from combined strong and weak lensing analyses .",
    "we find that all the four clusters have best - fit value of @xmath42 higher than the theoretical expectations .",
    "we still see the excess even if we take the lensing bias into account , although the value of @xmath42 for each cluster is marginally consistent with the theory if the error is taken into account .",
    "put another way , the excess is not so strong as claimed in earlier work based on analysis of different lensing clusters @xcite . by combining all the 10 clusters ,",
    "it is clear that our sample of lensing clusters has larger concentrations than expected from the @xmath36-@xmath42 relation predicted by the @xmath4cdm model .",
    "the concentrations are also higher than the relation determined observationally by @xcite for a sample of lensing and x - ray clusters .",
    "since our sample can not constrain the redshift and mass dependence of the mean concentration very well , we fix them to those in equation ( [ eq : c_duffy ] ) and fit the overall normalization to the data .",
    "we find @xmath186 as our best - fit to the results of 10 lensing clusters .",
    "the data are inconsistent with the concentration parameter predicted in the @xmath4cdm by @xmath187 , even if we include the @xmath62 enhancement to account for the lensing bias . emission line .",
    "this is because the lower limit of the arc redshift corresponds to the upper limit of the cluster core mass and hence to the upper limit of the concentration parameter . ]",
    "a simple average of theconcentration parameter ( with the inverse of the measurement error as a weight ) ignoring the mass and redshift dependence is @xmath188 .",
    "we also check the excess as a function of the einstein radius , which is a central quantity to characterize the central structure of a cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the plot in figure  [ fig : clupar ] shows that the excess of @xmath42 depends slightly on the einstein radius .",
    "we fit the data by a power - law and find @xmath189 where @xmath86 is the einstein radius for the source redshift @xmath190 .",
    "the hypothesis that this ratio does not depend on the einstein radius is rejected at 99% confidence level .",
    "the weak dependence of the excess on the einstein radius is reasonable in the sense that concentrated two - dimensional mass distributions are required for clusters to produce large einstein radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper , we have studied the mass profiles of four clusters by combining strong lens constraints with weak lensing shear measurements .",
    "we have drawn our sample from giant arc clusters newly discovered by the sgas , the new arc survey using the sdss data @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of follow - up wide - field _ subaru _ suprime - cam images to obtain weak lensing constraints out to nearly the virial radii of the clusters .",
    "the central densities of the clusters are determined well from the arcs with the redshifts spectroscopically measured partly from our ongoing program with the _ gemini _ telescope .",
    "the technique allows us to study the radial mass profile over 2  dex in radius , which is essential for reliable extractions of concentrations of the clusters .",
    "we have found that the radial profiles are fitted well by the nfw profile .",
    "we have determined the virial mass @xmath36 and concentration parameter @xmath42 of the four clusters accurately from the combined strong and weak lensing analysis .",
    "we confirmed that strongly lensed background galaxies with measured redshifts indeed improve constraints on mass profiles , particularly @xmath42 .",
    "we have found the values of @xmath42 for our 4 clusters to be @xmath5 , except for sdss2111 whose radial profile was not constrained very well because of insufficient strong lens information .",
    "the values are slightly higher than the @xmath4cdm predictions , even if we take account of the lensing bias that clusters with giant arcs are more centrally concentrated ( intrinsically and/or apparently due to the projection effect ) than normal clusters , although the excess is not as large as that claimed in earlier work . by combining all the 10 clusters with strong plus weak lensing analysis available , we confirm a @xmath187 excess of the concentration parameter compared with the @xmath4cdm prediction .",
    "we find that the excess is dependent on the einstein radius of the system such that clusters with larger einstein radii show larger excess of the concentration parameters .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the excess of the concentration parameter .",
    "one such explanation is the effect of baryons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the adiabatic contraction associated with the baryon cooling can enhance the core density of dark matter and hence can increase the concentration of clusters .",
    "another possibility is that theoretical predictions are not so accurate . in particular , the probability distribution of the concentration parameter for very massive halos ( @xmath191 ) and its redshift evolution has not been studied very much in @xmath3-body simulations , and thus our theoretical predictions inevitably rely on extrapolations from lower - mass halos . for example",
    ", it has been claimed that the redshift evolution of the concentrations of most massive halos may be different from that of less massive halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus it is important to perform many realizations of large box - size @xmath3-body simulations to improve the accuracy of theoretical predictions at the high mass end .",
    "a more exotic interpretation is that clusters form earlier than expected from the @xmath4cdm model , as the concentration is known to correlate with the formation epoch of the cluster @xcite .",
    "such modification of the formation epoch can for instance be realized by considering early dark energy or primordial non - gaussianity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this paper has presented initial results of detailed studies for our unique sample of giant arc clusters @xcite . to investigate the structure of lensing clusters in a more systematic and statistical manner",
    ", it is of great importance to extend this research by applying the technique we have developed in this paper to other lensing clusters .",
    "in addition , it is important to improve constraints on the mass models of individual clusters by adding more data . measuring redshifts of more arcs will significantly refine our strong lens modeling .",
    "in addition , dynamical information from the velocity dispersion measurement , as well as x - ray and sunyaev - zeldovich signals , provide an important cross check of our mass models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
