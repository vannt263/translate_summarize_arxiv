    "random geometric networks  @xcite consist of a collection of nodes randomly scattered in a region of space , pairwise connected with a relative position dependent probability . an important application of network theory ( amongst many others )",
    "is in wireless communications .",
    "communication networks , provide rapid transfer of information across space , with applications ranging from the internet , tele - medicine , intelligent transport , tracking of endangered species , hazard detection systems , security monitoring , etcetera ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "consequently , resilience to random faults or attacks are of paramount importance for the smooth functionality of the system .",
    "a typical measure of network robustness ( particularly for communication networks ) is @xmath0-connectivity , that is , if any @xmath1 nodes are randomly chosen and removed the remaining network remains fully connected .",
    "equivalently , a network is said to be @xmath0-connected if for each pair of nodes there exist at least @xmath0 mutually independent paths connecting them  @xcite .",
    "[ fig:123conn ] shows examples of @xmath2 , and @xmath3 connected networks . in general",
    ", the random removal of nodes may result from a technical failure ( e.g. a software / hardware malfunction ) or a random attack that may disrupt network functionality and lead to cascades of catastrophic failures @xcite .",
    "examples of networks with @xmath4 nodes in a convex domain satisfying @xmath2 , and @xmath3 connectivity from left to right . ]",
    "historically , the classical problem of @xmath0-connectivity has been addressed in the asymptotic limit of infinite network size and deterministic link formation whenever nodes are within a certain range @xcite .",
    "instead , we consider spatially _ confined _ networks formed by _ probabilistic",
    "_ link connections .",
    "many real networks , although large , are not of infinite size and are often confined within a finite region .",
    "this makes classic percolation @xcite and random graph @xcite approaches undesirable or even unsuitable in certain occasions .",
    "furthermore , noise , uncertainty , or the variation in connectivity range of individual nodes justifies the use of probabilistic link formations rather than deterministic ones .",
    "in fact , probabilistic link - models are much preferred in many applications , for instance in wireless communications where they can adequately account for small - scale scattering and fading effects @xcite .    in this letter , we derive closed form analytic formulas for the probability of a random network residing in arbitrary 2 and 3 dimensional convex domains to be @xmath0-connected .",
    "we achieve this by undertaking both _ local _ and _ global _ approaches to @xmath0-connectivity .",
    "the former refers to the local perspective of a single node , while the latter to the global perspective of large clusters of nodes .",
    "contrary to the expected universal features of large networks , our analysis reveals that the global network observable of @xmath0-connectivity is governed by distinct microscopic details of the network boundary such as sharp corners rather than macroscopic ones such as the domain volume .",
    "significantly , our analytic results provide sufficient quantitative detail to support optimization of system parameters in order to design reliable networks @xcite , mitigate boundary effects and avoid the need for heavy computer simulations .",
    "finally , the techniques presented below provide a flexible and mathematically tractable framework for further analysis of confined random networks .",
    "the networks we wish to model consists of @xmath5 randomly distributed nodes with locations @xmath6 a convex subset of @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , according to a uniform density @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denotes the size of the set using the lebesgue measure of the appropriate dimension or the cardinality of a finite set .",
    "we consider convex geometries as we only allow for line - of - sight links between nodes .",
    "after deployment of the nodes in @xmath12 , communication links between pairs of nodes are established with probability @xmath13 , often written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the distance between nodes @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the relevant network @xmath18 is formed , consisting of the set of nodes @xmath19 paired by the collection @xmath20 of direct links .",
    "we maintain physical relevance by adopting a specific pair connectedness function @xmath14 derived from wireless communication theory  @xcite and applicable to ad hoc and sensor networks . in particular , we use a rayleigh fading model suitable when there is no dominant communication channel along a single line of sight between transmitter and receiver but rather a sum of many paths with randomised phases .",
    "the resulting connection probability between two nodes a distance @xmath21 apart is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 depends on for example the transmission wavelength , signal power , etc . , and sets the characteristic connection length @xmath24 and the parameter @xmath25 is called the path loss exponent and is typically set to @xmath26 corresponding to propagation in free space but is experimentally observed to be @xmath27 for cluttered environments e.g. heavily built - up urban environments @xcite . unless otherwise stated , we will use @xmath26 . in doing so",
    "@xmath28 is a gaussian function thus rendering the mathematics tractable .",
    "it is worth noting that in the limit of @xmath29 , the connection between nodes is no longer probabilistic and converges to the well studied case in geometric graph theory  @xcite , the _ unit disk _ model with an _ on / off _ connection range at @xmath30 .",
    "however , much less effort has been dedicated on the connectivity properties of networks formed by probabilistic ( or soft ) connectivity functions @xmath28 .",
    "the connectivity of the network can be measured by checking whether any node @xmath16 can communicate in a multi - hop fashion with any other node @xmath31 .",
    "if this is the case then the network is said to be fully connected , or @xmath32-connected . in computer simulations , one initiates a search algorithm to count the number of connected components ( clusters ) .",
    "if only a single cluster is found then @xmath32-connectivity is established .",
    "typically such algorithms have computation complexity of @xmath33 . for @xmath34-connectivity",
    ", a random node is removed from the network and the search algorithm is run .",
    "if successful , the node is replaced and its original links reconnected and a different node is removed and the algorithm is repeated .",
    "if successful for all @xmath5 nodes then @xmath35connectivity is established .",
    "therefore , the computational complexity is now of @xmath36 . for @xmath0-connectivity",
    "this number grows like @xmath37 .    for a given node density @xmath38",
    "we are interested in the probability @xmath39 of a randomly formed network to be @xmath0-connected .",
    "of course this depends on the connectivity function @xmath14 and the domain shape . in order to produce the @xmath40-curve describing @xmath39 as a function of the density @xmath38",
    ", one needs to perform a monte carlo computer simulation , averaging over many realizations of the above described algorithm . in this paper",
    "we will provide closed form analytical formulas which accurately predict this function in @xmath34 and @xmath3 dimensional convex domains hence eliminating the need for such heavy computer simulations .",
    "we adopt a _ bottom - up _ approach and begin our investigation from the local view point of a single node .",
    "the probability that node @xmath16 situated at @xmath41 connects with a randomly chosen node @xmath17 is obtained by averaging over all possible node positions @xmath42 @xmath43 note that @xmath44 can be studied in detail for different pair - connectedness functions @xmath28 ( e.g. anisotropic ) , and power and diversity scaling laws can be deduced through in - depth analysis  @xcite . in the discussion that follows however , we will mainly be concerned with global network observables and concentrate on how local properties of nodes contribute to them .",
    "since nodes are deployed independently with a uniform density , the probability that node @xmath16 connects with exactly @xmath0 other nodes ( i.e. node @xmath16 is of degree @xmath0 ) denoted here by @xmath45 , is given by the binomial distribution @xmath46 which for @xmath28 a hard step function ( @xmath47 ) would correspond to the probability of finding @xmath0 nodes ( excluding node @xmath16 ) in the @xmath30-neighbourhood of @xmath48 , and @xmath49 nodes elsewhere in the available domain @xmath50 .",
    "another way of expressing   is achieved by noting that if @xmath5 is large and @xmath51 is small , @xmath45 is well approximated by the poisson distribution @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the corresponding cumulative distribution function .",
    "this approximation is justified here as @xmath55 , thus making @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "integrating over @xmath58 gives @xmath59 , the probability that two randomly selected nodes connect to form a pair @xmath60 numerical integration of for a square and a circular disk domain of equal volumes reveals that @xmath59 is very much insensitive to the domain s shape and decays like @xmath61 as @xmath62 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pair ] a ) ) . note that the important length scale here is not the aspect ratio of the domain but the ratio of the connection range @xmath30 and the typical size of the system .",
    "for example , @xmath63 of an elongated rectangular domain would decay as predicted above if its shortest side is much greater than @xmath30 and its total volume @xmath64 is large .",
    "the average number of nodes connected to a node in a network is called the _",
    "mean degree_. from the degree distribution   we can immediately deduce that the mean degree ( as well as the variance ) is just @xmath65 and is also highly insensitive to the domain shape .",
    "moreover , for @xmath5 and @xmath64 large , we have that @xmath66 .",
    "finally , we turn to investigate short range correlations and look at the 2-point correlation function in an infinite domain . here",
    ", we keep @xmath25 general and consider 3 nodes with polar coordinates @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 and define the two point correlation function as @xmath70 equation is nothing more than bayes theorem measuring how likely it is that node 1 connects with node 3 , given that node 1 is connected with node 2 .",
    "the denominator of amounts to @xmath71 . expanding the integrand of the numerator in powers of @xmath72 we obtain @xmath73",
    "note that for @xmath28 a deterministic step function ( i.e. @xmath47 ) equation diverges and instead is given by the circle - circle intersection @xmath74 .",
    "this short calculation suggests that two nearby nodes are strongly correlated for deterministic ( hard ) connectivity functions with @xmath75 .",
    "this is not the case however for probabilistic ( soft ) connectivity functions .",
    "indeed for the softest case of @xmath26 we have @xmath76 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that this distinction of hard versus soft @xmath28 persists in higher dimensions and for correlations between @xmath77 nodes .     a ) log - log plot of @xmath63 vs @xmath64 for square and circular disk domains of equal volumes illustrated with square / disk markers using @xmath78 .",

    "we define the spatial average of an observable @xmath84 over all possible node configurations as @xmath85 assuming that for @xmath86 , the degree of node @xmath16 is almost independent of the degree of node @xmath87 , we write @xcite @xmath88}^{n } \\label{pmd } .\\end{split}\\ ] ] the seemingly strong assumption of independence made here is justified when performing the spatial average   as two nodes @xmath16 and @xmath17 are sufficiently apart and thus uncorrelated for most node positions in @xmath50 .",
    "this is particularly true in dense networks and therefore we expect the approximation in to improve as @xmath5 grows .",
    "furthermore , for soft connectivity functions @xmath28 , we expect only weak correlations between @xmath89-tuples of nodes , as argued in the previous section ( see eq .  ) .    substituting in   the definition of @xmath54 , performing the average and omitting terms of @xmath90 we arrive at @xmath91}^{n } \\label{pmd}\\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 .",
    "there are several important observations to be highlighted here .",
    "firstly , in the high density limit we expect the integrals appearing in equation   to be dominated by contributions where @xmath93 is small .",
    "this is due to the exponential part of the integrand dominating over the power .",
    "secondly , we expect that @xmath93 is small near the domain boundaries i.e. near the corners and edges ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pair ] b ) ) which physically correspond to the most _ hard to connect to _ regions of @xmath50 .",
    "we conclude by noting that unlike @xmath94 , @xmath95 is strongly influenced by the details of the domain boundary .",
    "the integrals to be approximated in are of the form @xmath96 where @xmath97 . due to the short - range interactions between nodes , hard to connect to regions become almost independent of each - other and so we approximate the integral of   by a sum of independent contributions due to different boundary objects @xcite .",
    "that is , for an arbitrary convex domain @xmath98 the integral of can be approximated by the sum of the bulk contribution ( @xmath99 ) , and a number of edge ( @xmath100 ) and corner ( @xmath101 ) contributions @xmath102 for instance , the  house \" domain shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : house ] , as far as @xmath103 is concerned , decomposes into a homogeneous bulk contribution , @xmath104 edges and finally @xmath104 corners .",
    "the only restriction in this approximation is that the individual boundary elements are sufficiently apart ( approximately a distance greater than @xmath105 ) .",
    "we now consider each of these contributions separately , first for @xmath106 and later for @xmath107 .",
    "due to length restrictions , we will omit any tedious calculations and give only important steps and final results . the bulk contribution to",
    "can be obtained by ignoring any boundary effects and thus considering a homogeneous domain leading to @xmath108 , such that @xmath109 .    the edge contribution to",
    "can be obtained by ignoring any curvature effects and thus considering the positive half plane @xmath110 entailing @xmath111 @xmath112     decomposition of a house domain into contributions from the bulk , the @xmath104 edges and @xmath104 corners . ]    the corner contribution to   can be obtained by considering a wedge domain @xmath113 in polar coordinates for general angle @xmath114 .",
    "expanding @xmath115 to linear order in @xmath116 , i.e. near the corner we get @xmath117 @xmath118 note that @xmath119 can be expressed as a single term but does not provide further insight and so is left as such .",
    "we now repeat the above calculations for @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , @xmath103 now decomposes into a homogeneous bulk contribution ( @xmath99 ) , a surface area contribution ( @xmath40 ) , and edge ( @xmath100 ) and corner ( @xmath101 ) contributions @xmath121 we will restrict the discussion to domains belonging to the set of right prisms ; a polyhedron that accurately models many geometries that can be found in practice e.g. many room configurations in a modern building . as there is only one variable angle to consider we can benefit from the use of cylindrical coordinates when calculating @xmath122 and @xmath119 .    using spherical coordinates , we expand @xmath123 for @xmath116 and find that for homogeneous domains @xmath124 , and @xmath125 .    for the surface area contribution , we expand @xmath123 to linear order in @xmath126 , where @xmath127 and @xmath40 is the total surface area of the domain . in doing",
    "so we are effectively saying that the surface area contribution to for an arbitrary right prism is equal to that of a sphere of equal surface area .",
    "details such as corners and edges are ignored at this stage as they will be considered separately at a later stage .",
    "we find that @xmath128 , @xmath129    where two planes meet at an angle @xmath130 , an edge of length @xmath131 is formed . to calculate the contribution to due to the edge we express @xmath123 in cylindrical coordinates such that the edge is centred along the @xmath132-axis .",
    "we expand @xmath123 about @xmath133 , keeping only linear terms we get @xmath134 , @xmath135    finally , corners in right prisms are formed where 3 edges come together , 2 of which are at an angle @xmath136 and the 3rd is perpendicular to both .",
    "we center the corner at the origin with the perpendicular edge running along the positive @xmath132-axis .",
    "we expand @xmath123 about @xmath137 keeping only linear terms and calculate @xmath138 @xmath139    in hindsight of the above calculations , it easy to see that 2d and 3d contributions to are similar in structure , hence hinting towards possible generalization to arbitrary dimensions @xmath140 .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the dominant contribution at hight densities @xmath38 comes from @xmath119 .",
    "physically , this makes sense as @xmath95 is most probable to fail near the hardest to connect to region of @xmath50 , i.e. the sharpest corner , in our case characterised by its angle @xmath136 .",
    "for a given configuration of node positions we define @xmath141 as the probability of the corresponding network to be @xmath0-connected .",
    "the average of this quantity over all possible node configurations @xmath142 is the overall probability of obtaining a @xmath0-connected network .",

    "recall that @xmath18 is a network consisting of the set of nodes @xmath19 paired by the collection @xmath20 of direct links . as a slight abuse of notation we have used @xmath153 to denote that @xmath154 is an element of the set of links @xmath131 associated with @xmath155 .",
    "the sum in equation   contains @xmath156 separate terms and can be expressed as collections of terms determined by their largest cluster : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the set of graphs with nodes in @xmath40 , and @xmath159 the set of graphs with nodes in @xmath40 and largest connected component ( cluster ) of size @xmath17 with @xmath160 .",

    "hence , rearranging equation   and averaging over all possible node configurations we get @xmath162 equation   clearly confirms the physical picture that at high densities , full connectivity is simply the complement of the probability of an isolated node i.e. a node of degree @xmath163 .",
