    "-5 mm    this text is a brief outline of results and examples related with the bijectivity of the norm residue homomorphism  also called `` bloch - kato conjecture '' and , for the @xmath1 case , `` milnor conjecture '' .",
    "the starting point was a result of voevodsky which he communicated in 1996 .",
    "voevodsky s theorem basically reduces the bloch - kato conjecture to the existence of norm varieties and to what i call hilbert s 90 for symbols .",

    "elements in @xmath7 of the form @xmath8 are called symbols ( @xmath9 , of weight  @xmath6 ) .    a field extension @xmath10 of  @xmath3",
    "is called a splitting field of @xmath11 if @xmath12 in @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the norm residue homomorphism .",
    "-5 mm    all successful approaches to the bloch - kato conjecture consist of an investigation of appropriate generic splitting varieties of symbols .",
    "this goes back to the work of merkurjev and suslin on the case @xmath15 who studied the @xmath0-cohomology of severi - brauer varieties @xcite .",
    "similarly , for the case @xmath16 ( for @xmath17 by merkurjev , suslin @xcite and the author @xcite , for all @xmath6 by voevodsky @xcite ) one considers certain quadrics associated with pfister forms . for a long time it was not clear which sort of varieties one should consider for arbitrary @xmath6 ,  @xmath2 . in some cases one knew candidates , but these were non - smooth varieties and desingularizations appeared to be difficult to handle .",
    "finally voevodsky proposed a surprising characterization of the necessary varieties .",
    "it involves characteristic numbers and yields a beautiful relation between symbols and cobordism theory .",

    "-5 mm    the theme of `` degree formulas '' goes back to voevodsky s first text on the milnor conjecture ( although he never formulated explicitly a `` formula '' ) @xcite . in this section",
    "we formulate the degree formula for the characteristic numbers  @xmath45 .",
    "it shows the birational invariance of the notion of norm varieties .    the first proof of this formula relied on voevodsky s stable homotopy theory of algebraic varieties .",
    "later we found a rather elementary approach @xcite , which is in spirit very close to `` elementary '' approaches to the complex cobordism ring @xcite , @xcite .    for our approach to hilbert",
    "s 90 for symbols we use also `` higher degree formulas '' which again were first settled using voevodsky s stable homotopy theory  @xcite .",

    "we apply the degree formula to norm varieties .",
    "let @xmath11 be a nontrivial symbol @xmath9 and let @xmath20 be a norm variety for  @xmath11 . since @xmath21 splits  @xmath11 , so does any residue class field  @xmath68 for @xmath69 . as @xmath11 is of exponent  @xmath2",
