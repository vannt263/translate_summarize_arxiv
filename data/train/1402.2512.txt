    "although real galaxies are by no means in states of dynamical equilibrium , equilibrium models have a fundamental role to play in the study of galaxies and the universe .",
    "one reason for this is that most of a galaxy s mass is thought to reside in dark matter that can only be traced by its gravitational field , and we can map this field through the kinematics of field stars only to the extent that the stars are in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "a further reason is that modest deviations of galaxies from dynamical equilibrium are best modelled by perturbing equilibrium models  most successful branches of physics , from celestial mechanics to high - energy physics through plasma physics and quantum condensed - matter physics , comprise applications of perturbation theory .",
    "currently the range of equilibrium galaxy models is extraordinarily limited .",
    "the theory of globular clusters rests to a great extent on the equilibrium models introduced by @xcite and popularised by @xcite .",
    "our still very limited understanding of spiral structure owes much to the two - dimensional equilibrium models of @xcite , zang & toomre @xcite and evans @xcite .    on account of the paucity of fully three - dimensional equilibrium models ,",
    "several recent analyses of our galaxy s halo have relied on models which have distribution functions ( s ) of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a star s energy and @xmath4 is the magnitude of its angular momentum @xcite .",
    "models with a  of this form only make dynamical sense to the extent that the gravitational potential can be considered to be spherically symmetric , which it probably can not be in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "moreover , in the case of radial bias , the ( [ eq : beta ] ) implies infinite phase - space density in the limit @xmath5 of radial orbits , which is inherently implausible and potentially compromises the model s stability @xcite , while in the case @xmath6 of tangential bias , the  implies a distribution of velocities that is physically implausible because it is bimodal in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "hence s of the form ( [ eq : beta ] ) do not constitute a satisfactory basis for dynamical modelling .",
    "although galaxies are probably never precisely axisymmetric , they are often sufficiently nearly so for axisymmetric models to be valuable starting points from which better - fitting models may be derived by perturbation theory . in this paper",
    "we present a new class of axisymmetric models . in a subsequent paper",
    "it will be shown how the technique we introduce here can be used to produce a wide range of axisymmetric models .    already in the paper in which jeans introduced his theorem , it was clear that the equilibrium  of our galaxy can not be a function of the form @xmath8 that depends only on the classical integrals in an axisymmetric potential .",
    "dependence on a third integral @xmath9 is essential , and the field has been held back by the want of an analytic formula for @xmath10 . in the 1970s it became evident that the s of elliptical galaxies also involve @xmath9 in an essential way @xcite , although recent systematic surveys have cast a new light on this conclusion @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it remains true that an abundance of observational material indicates that realistic equilibrium models of real galaxies must depend on @xmath9 in addition to @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "numerical orbit integrations in the 1960s showed that generic orbits in flattened axisymmetric potentials respect a third integral @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "but these experiments did not lead to useful analytic expressions for @xmath10 .",
    "a promising attack on this problem through hamiltonian perturbation theory was pursued by contopoulos and his collaborators @xcite , but this line of attack was frustrated by the fact that the vertical oscillations of most stars are far from harmonic , so their orbits are not readily treated as perturbed harmonic oscillators . moreover the coupling between a star s radial and vertical oscillations is fundamental to their dynamics , so neither motion should be considered in isolation .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that analytic expressions for @xmath9 can be obtained for a certain class of potentials that are now known as stckel potentials .",
    "@xcite showed that many of these potentials are generated by remarkably galaxy - like density distributions , and he clarified the nature of orbits in these potentials .",
    "the present paper relies on a technique , the `` stckel fudge '' ( * ? ? ? * hereafter b12a ) , which is an extension of this classic work .",
    "this approximation consists of applying to an arbitrary gravitational potential @xmath11 formulae that would be valid if the potential were of stckel s form even though the potential does not have this form .",
    "since any function of a star s isolating integrals is itself an isolating integral , there is in principle enormous freedom in the choice of arguments of a galaxy s .",
    "however , certain integrals stand out for special consideration : the action integrals .",
    "these alone can be embedded in a canonical coordinate system , and their conjugate ( angle ) variables have the remarkable property of increasing linearly in time : @xmath12 action integrals are unique up to a set of discrete canonical transformations that map between rational linear combinations of any given set of actions , and map the angle variables into integer linear combinations of the given angles .",
    "hence when combined with reasonably physical requirements such as `` the radial action @xmath13 should quantify the extent of radial oscillations '' and `` the vertical action @xmath14 should quantify the extent of vertical oscillations '' , actions are uniquely defined .",
    "this uniqueness greatly facilitates the comparison of models by making it possible to compare the density with which orbits in slightly different potentials are populated .",
    "therefore it is natural to require the  to be a function @xmath0 of the actions .    to derive from @xmath0 the observable properties of a model , we need expressions for the actions as function @xmath15 of the ordinary phase - space coordinates .",
    "here we use the stckel fudge from b12a .",
    "numerical experiments presented in b12a show that the actions and angles that one obtains from the fudge are significantly more accurate than those obtained from the adiabatic approximation @xcite , and they are also valid for orbits that move far from the equatorial plane and thus lie outside the range of validity of the adiabatic approximation . whereas @xcite and @xcite only required actions for orbits that pass within @xmath16 of the solar neighbourhood , we require actions throughout our models . this change has prompted us to undertake significant revisions of the scheme described by b12a to obtain them with increased accuracy and reduced numerical effort .",
    "these revisions are described in appendix i.    in section [ sec : df ] we define our s , which are derived from the of the isochrone sphere . in section [ sec : relax ] we explain how a model is relaxed to its self - consistent configuration and detail checks of the numerical accuracy . in section [ sec : obs ] we describe the observable properties of some specific models and refine our choice of . in section [ sec : appls ] we discuss some potential applications of these models , including choice of initial conditions for n - body models , studies of symmetry breaking in stellar systems and related perturbation analyses , and modelling observations of early - type galaxies .",
    "section [ sec : conclude ] sums up .",
    "two appendices give numerical details that are likely to be useful when building the models .",
    "the isochrone potential @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the model s total mass and @xmath19 is its scale length , is highly unusual in that it admits analytic expressions for the both angles and actions as functions of @xmath20 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we obtain @xmath28 by using equation ( [ eq : hj ] ) to eliminate @xmath29 from equation [ eq : fh ] .",
    "@xmath30 generates a spherical model because @xmath31 and @xmath14 appear in it on an equal footing .",
    "we can flatten the model by causing the  to decrease with increasing @xmath14 faster than with increasing @xmath13 or @xmath31",
    ". a  that achieves this goal is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a triple of constants with @xmath34 .    the radial density profile of a spherical model is largely determined by @xmath35 , the number of stars per unit energy at @xmath3 ( * ? ?",
    "4.5 and  4.4 ) .",
    "that is , the radial density profile of a model changes only modestly when stars are shifted over a surface of constant @xmath3 .",
    "a tangentially anisotropic model is created if stars are shifted over the surface towards the line @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the energy of a circular orbit of energy @xmath3 ( ) . conversely , a radially anisotropic model is created if stars are moved over surfaces of constant @xmath3 towards the @xmath13 axis .",
    "given that the  is invariably a decreasing function of all three actions , when we replace @xmath38 in @xmath39 with @xmath40 , the value of @xmath39 is decreased for a given value of @xmath41 if @xmath42 , and increased otherwise .",
    "we would like these changes to average to zero over a surface of constant @xmath3 so we can interpret them as the results of moving stars over these surfaces while keeping @xmath43 unchanged . for @xmath44 , the change in @xmath39 caused by the substitution @xmath45 is @xmath46 in order to preserve the radial density profile , we want the integral of @xmath47 over a surface of constant @xmath3 to vanish .",
    "this will be approximately the case if @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the barycentre of the surface of constant @xmath3 , i.e. , the action of the form @xmath50 that lies in the surface .",
    "for the isochrone potential one finds @xmath51    so long as we require equation ( [ eq : dfzero ] ) to be satisfied , only two of the scaling factors @xmath52 should be considered independent for the third can be obtained from this equation .",
    "below we explore models in which @xmath53 and @xmath54 are taken to be constants and @xmath55 becomes through equation ( [ eq : dfzero ] ) a function of energy : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the angular and radial frequencies of the specified orbit in the isochrone sphere defined by equation ( [ eq : theta_of_t ] ) .",
    "the  of the isochrone is an even function of the angular momentum @xmath59 and this property is preserved by the transformation ( [ eq : foj ] ) proposed above . when the  is an even function of @xmath31 , the model does not rotate .",
    "it can be set rotating by adding to the given even , @xmath60 , a  @xmath61 that is an odd function of @xmath31 .",
    "then the complete  becomes @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a free parameter that allows one to vary the rotation speed from zero at @xmath64 up to a maximum value that is set by the requirement that @xmath39 is never negative .",
    "given an even  @xmath60 , a natural definition of an odd  is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is an odd function of @xmath31 .",
    "a maximally rotating model is obtained by choosing @xmath67 and @xmath68 , but with this choice of @xmath69 , @xmath39 is discontinuous on the plane @xmath70 , where its absolute value is typically large . to avoid such a discontinuity we adopt @xmath71 here",
    "@xmath72 is a dimensionless parameter that specifies the steepness of the rotation curve near the origin : the larger the value of @xmath72 , the more steeply the curve rises . with these choices we have",
    "@xmath73 naturally the azimuthal velocity dispersion is @xmath74",
    "given values for @xmath75 and @xmath72 to specify a , one has to recover the corresponding model s density and self - consistent potential from iterations .",
    "one adopts some trial gravitational potential @xmath76 and computes the density implied by @xmath77 and the  on a grid in the @xmath78 plane .",
    "then one computes the potential @xmath79 implied by this density distribution , and computes the extrapolated potential @xmath80 now one repeats this cycle with @xmath77 replaced by @xmath81 . a positive value of @xmath82 speeds convergence of these iterations ; if @xmath82 is above a threshold , numerical instability sets in .",
    "for the s explored here , @xmath83 works well .",
    "figs  [ fig:0itr ] and [ fig:0cont ] show results obtained with @xmath84 , @xmath85 when the trial potential @xmath77 is that of an isochrone sphere flattened to axis ratio @xmath86 . in a black dotted curve",
    "shows the density on the minor axis yielded by the  in the trial potential divided by the density of the corresponding isochrone sphere .",
    "the red curve shows the corresponding ratios after one adjustment to the potential , followed by the magenta , green and blue curves for the second through the fourth adjustments of the potential .",
    "the near coincidence of the green and blue curves demonstrates that the iterations have essentially reached a stationary point .",
    "the full curves in show the corresponding results for the major axis . where the blue curves run nearly horizontally , the density profile is essentially proportional to that of the underlying isochrone sphere , as planned . within @xmath87",
    "the full and dotted blue curves necessarily converge on a point , which indicates the ratio of the central density in the final model to that of the isochrone sphere .    finding the density and potential that correspond to a given  using five iterations of the density takes @xmath88 cpu hours on a desk - top machine .",
    "if the key loop of the code is parallelised a model can be constructed in less than half an hour .",
    "many checks on the accuracy of the computations are possible .",
    "first , one can compute orbits in a model s potential and evaluate the actions at different points along the orbit .",
    "the fluctuations in the computed actions are then typically @xmath89 of @xmath90 .",
    "errors in the evaluation of forces and the potential by interpolation on the radial grid ( see appendix ii ) could alone account for errors of this magnitude .",
    "interpolation of the grid in action space ( appendix i ) introduces errors of order @xmath91 in the actions used for the evaluation of moments .    when the apparatus is used to evaluate the density of a model that is essentially the isochrone sphere by setting @xmath92 in the  and adopting the potential of an isochrone sphere that has been squashed to axis ratio @xmath93 ( the case @xmath94 gives rise to a singularity in the equations employed ) , the density of the isochrone sphere is recovered to parts in @xmath95 .",
    "the integral @xmath96 yields the mass of the model divided by @xmath97 and from the definition ( [ eq : foj ] ) of the  it follows that the model s mass is the same as that of the isochrone , @xmath18 .",
    "numerically we can compute the mass of a model that lies within radius @xmath98 by computing @xmath99 times the monopole component of the radial component of the gravitational force @xmath100 . in the typical case of the flattened model plotted in , with the outer edge of the grid set to @xmath101",
    ", the radial force implies that @xmath102 lies inside @xmath101 , while in the isochrone sphere @xmath103 lies inside @xmath101 .",
    "the discrepancy between these two masses is a small fraction of the mass that lies outside the grid in the spherical case .",
    "this finding is consistent with there being no error in the computed mass and potential .",
    "note too that we expect to obtain the same mass by integrating @xmath39 over @xmath41 as we do by integrating @xmath104 over @xmath105 only because the @xmath106 system is canonical .",
    "hence the mass check tests the validity of the stckel fudge .",
    "the virial theorem provides three useful checks on both the validity of the calculations and the convergence of the potential . for an axisymmetric system the tensor virial theorem has two non - trivial components , one , @xmath107 associated with the cylindrical radius @xmath108 and a vertical component , @xmath109 .",
    "the sum of these two components constitutes the scalar virial theorem , @xmath110 .",
    "after five iterations one finds in a typical case that @xmath111 while @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "a further check on accuracy is provided by the jeans equations . as discussed below ,",
    "these are satisfied to within the precision with which we are evaluating spatial derivatives within the final model .",
    "we consider first non - rotating models .",
    "the half - mass radius of the isochrone sphere is @xmath114 .",
    "the top panel of shows contours of constant density of the model with @xmath84 , @xmath85 in the @xmath78 plane , with four contours per decade .",
    "the flattening of the model is evident .",
    "the black curve in the lower panel of shows the ellipticity @xmath115 of isodensity surfaces as a function of the length @xmath116 of the semi - major axis . from @xmath117 to @xmath118 @xmath119 is nearly constant , falling from @xmath120 to @xmath121 . inside @xmath122 ,",
    "the ellipticity @xmath119 rises steeply .",
    "in fact in this model the peak density is not reached at the centre but in the equatorial plane at @xmath123 .",
    "the density at the centre is , however , @xmath124 times the peak density , so the upward lurch of the ellipticity curve in is caused by a very minor depression in the central density .    the black curve in shows the ellipticity as a function of the logarithm of radius in the model obtained by setting @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the choice @xmath125 implies that the dependence of the  on @xmath31 is precisely that of the isochrone sphere , so equation ( [ eq : dfzero ] ) now causes @xmath55 to be materially smaller than unity , so the  becomes radially biased .",
    "the ellipticity peaks at @xmath127 just outside the core and further out slowly declines , reaching @xmath128 at @xmath129 . inside the core @xmath119 plunges to negative values , passing zero at @xmath130 and reaching @xmath131 @xmath132 .",
    "thus the innermost part of the model is prolate rather than oblate .",
    "it is instructive to understand why .    in we",
    "plot the terms that appear in the radial jeans equation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq 4.222a ) .",
    "when we evaluate this equation in the equatorial plane , where @xmath133 by symmetry , it becomes @xmath134 the figure shows that the dominant terms in this equation are the first and last terms , which are plotted in red and blue , respectively .",
    "the other two terms are comparable outside @xmath135 but further in the anisotropy term ( that involving @xmath136 ) , shown in magenta , first dominates the term involving @xmath137 and then dominates the radial - force term , which has to vanish at the origin .",
    "it acts in the same sense as the radial - force term , i.e. , inwards , and the pressure term ( plotted in red ) has to grow in magnitude to counteract it .",
    "it is this term that makes the model s centre prolate .",
    "shows the radial dependencies of @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 along this model s principal axes .",
    "we see that at the centre is approached through the equatorial plane , @xmath139 , plotted in blue , does approach @xmath141 ( black ) from below , but shows that it does not do so quite fast enough to prevent the anisotropy term in the radial jeans equation growing as the centre is approached .",
    "an analogous analysis of the jeans equations for the oblate model plotted in shows that in this model the anisotropy term is slightly negative , so it pushes material away from the centre and thus gives rise to the slight central depression in the density that is responsible to the central spike in the model s ellipticity curve .",
    "physically the steep rise in the ellipticity of the tangentially biased model and the central prolateness of the radially biased model are not very significant because in the nearly homogeneous core a small difference between the densities distance @xmath98 from the origin along the minor and major axes can translate into a large ellipticity of the isodensity surfaces . nonetheless , these central ellipticity changes detract from the models elegance , and we seek a modification of the  that will moderate or eliminate them .    from the jeans equations",
    "it is clear that the key is to ensure that @xmath142 fast enough as @xmath143 .",
    "since the  of the isochrone sphere has @xmath144 everywhere , our goal should be attainable by ensuring that @xmath145 as @xmath146 .",
    "setting @xmath147 in equation ( [ eq : dfzero ] ) we find that @xmath148 with @xmath149 given by equation ( [ eq : defsjbar ] ) .",
    "we can now require that both @xmath55 and @xmath53 tend to @xmath150 as @xmath146 by writing @xmath151 where @xmath152 is a given constant , @xmath153 is computed from equation with @xmath53 replaced by @xmath152 , and @xmath154 is a function that vanishes at the origin and is essentially unity for values of the argument bigger than @xmath155 .",
    "the broken red curve in the lower panel of fig .  [ fig:0cont ] shows the run of ellipticity we obtain when we use equations ( [ eq : defsai ] ) with @xmath156 and @xmath85 .",
    "the steep central rise in @xmath119 of the original model has been replaced by a modest decline to a central value just above 0.2 .",
    "the dashed red curve in shows the ellipticity of the radially biased model when equation ( [ eq : defsai ] ) is employed .",
    "the model now becomes slightly oblate rather than prolate deep in the core .",
    "[ fig:1srpz ] shows the variation within the @xmath78 plane of the velocity dispersions @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 within the azimuthally biased , non - rotating model with @xmath156 and @xmath85 .",

    "shows how the principal velocity dispersions vary along the major ( full curves ) and minor axes of the radially biased model @xmath157 , @xmath126 . the most remarkable feature is the extreme flatness of the @xmath140 profile along the minor axis ",

    "the centre and right panels of show the projected velocity dispersion and mean - streaming velocity of the maximally rotating version of the model .",
    "the contours of constant velocity dispersion are very boxy .",
    "the mean streaming velocity decreases with distance from the major axis , so the galaxy does not rotate on cylinders .",

    "now we evaluate the isochrone s",
    "@xmath179 at this radius and kinetic energy .",
    "next we choose random directions for the position and velocity vectors @xmath180 and @xmath105 and evaluate at the chosen phase - space position the actions @xmath181 for the flattened model , and thus evaluate the  @xmath0 . of this model .",

    "for some values of @xmath33 the model will be unstable to bar formation . specifically ,",
    "if @xmath55 is too small and the model too radially biased , it will suffer from the radial - orbit instability @xcite .",
    "similarly , if the model is set rotating too fast by adding a large odd  @xmath183 , it will develop a rotating bar .",
    "investigation of the onset and development of these instabilities promises to be a fascinating field of research that would extend to stellar dynamics the classical work of dedekind , jacobi and riemann on rotating fluid bodies @xcite .",
    "it is likely that for values of @xmath55 that are smaller than some critical value , @xmath184 a triaxial equilibrium can be found for the given @xmath0 that has lower energy than the axisymmetric equilibrium constructed here , and that axisymmetric models with @xmath185 are liable to the radial - orbit instability . in the limit of infinitely many stars",
    "implicit in our discussion , the transition from an axisymmetric equilibrium to a triaxial one has all the characteristics of a phase transition",
    ". it would be fascinating to know the nature of this transition .",
    "currently we are not in a position to construct triaxial models given @xmath0 because the stckel fudge used here seems not to extend to triaxial potentials .",
    "torus mapping does extend to barred systems , even rotating ones @xcite , so it should be possible to build models with given @xmath0 by this method .",
    "in addition to establishing the relations between axisymmetric and triaxial equilibria , one would want to follow the dynamics of the instability that effects the loss of symmetry .",
    "the present models are ideal for such an investigation from two respects .",
    "first , the growth of the perturbation can be followed in angle - action coordinates , which were invented to study the stability of the solar system and are thus the natural coordinates of hamiltonian perturbation theory . although angle - action coordinates have been used by a number of authors to study the stability of planar , axisymmetric discs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and spherical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , only a small number of rather special models have been studied in this way for want of a wider range of models for which angle - action coordinates are available .",
    "another direction of research into the stability of galaxies that is opened up by the present models is the method of perturbation particles @xcite . in this method , invented in unpublished work by g. rybicki",
    ", the initial model is represented by an analytic  and particles are used merely to quantify the difference between the model s time - evolving state and the initial condition .",
    "because the particles start massless and only gather ( positive and negative ) mass as the dynamics unfolds , the poisson fluctuations in the gravitational potential are much smaller than in a conventional n - body simulation with the same number of particles , and physics can be explored to higher precision . to date",
    "a major restriction on the use of the method has been the shortage of dynamically interesting equilibria for which @xmath186 is known analytically .",
    "hence our models greatly widen the range of applicability of this promising method .",
    "the advent of integral - field spectrographs has rejuvenated the study of the internal dynamics of early - type galaxies @xcite . now that it is feasible to quantify the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) over a large part of the image of an e or s0 galaxy , sophisticated dynamical models can be fitted to the data .",
    "in addition to mapping the variation of the mass - to - light ratio within early - type galaxies , these models have revealed internal structures in these systems , such as discs and kinematically decoupled cores .",
    "the models fitted have been of two types : schwarzschild orbit - superposition models @xcite and models based on the jeans equations @xcite . in either case the three - dimensional luminosity distribution is inferred from the photometry under some assumption of symmetry and inclination angle , a matching potential is adopted , and then model parameters are adjusted to optimise the fit between predicted and observed kinematics .",
    "schwarzschild modelling is very general but cumbersome because the model parameters are the weights @xmath187 of some thousands of orbits that together form a library , and the selection of orbits for the library is an art rather than a science . in view of these objections , models based on the jeans equations",
    "are widely used although they lack either generality or rigour depending on how the modelling is done .",
    "the rigorous approach is to assume that @xmath188 , which is equivalent to assuming that the has the restricted `` two - integral '' form @xmath8 .",
    "the  of our own galaxy is very different from a two - integral  so it is essential to fit more general models to observations of external galaxies .",
    "recently the `` jeans anisotropic multi - gaussian expansion '' ( jam ) models of @xcite have been widely used .",
    "these models assume that the principal axes of the velocity ellipsoid are always aligned with the cylindrical coordinate directions , and that @xmath189 , where @xmath19 is a constant .",
    "cappellari recognises that the principal axes really align much more nearly with prolate ellipsoidal coordinates than cylindrical coordinates ( as confirms ) but argues that on the minor axis , as in the equatorial plane , the short axis is parallel to the @xmath190 axis , while at intermediate latitudes the ellipsoid is nearly spherical . at points on the minor axis of any of our models the long axis of the velocity ellipsoid points radially rather than tangentially except in the core .",
    "it is worth understanding why this is so .    only orbits with small values of @xmath31 approach the minor axis , and in three dimensions an orbit of this type comprises an elliptical annulus that lies in a plane that is only slightly inclined to the minor axis and precesses around the axis .",
    "if the orbit s radial action is diminished , the annulus may shrinks within the precessing plane to an elliptical curve , and in the limit @xmath191 the orbit becomes a shell orbit . if @xmath13 is increased , the annulus becomes thick on account of the large radial excursions along the orbit . at a fixed energy , the sequence of orbits that starts with the shell orbit and proceeds through orbits of ever higher eccentricity",
    "is a sequence in which @xmath192 grows from zero to infinity . along the model",
    "s minor axis , orbits in the early part of this sequence stretch the model s velocity ellipsoid in the tangential direction , while orbits in the later part stretch the ellipsoid radially .",
    "hence the tangential bias along the minor axis that is assumed in the jam models implies dominance by orbits with small @xmath192 .",
    "however it is precisely these orbits that we have suppressed in order to make the model oblate .",
    "hence there is an essential connection between the flattening of our models and the radial bias of the velocity ellipsoids along the minor axis beyond the core .",
    "( inside the core orbits with small @xmath192 tend to oscillations along the minor axis rather than thin annuli in a precessing plane and the argument above does not hold . )    to construct a model in which the velocity ellipsoids behave as assumed when building a jam model one might add to one of our models a distinct population of stars on essentially @xmath70 shell orbits , i.e. orbits with @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "these orbits are elongated parallel to the model s symmetry axis , so adding them will reduce the model s flattening .",
    "but by the same token they will tend to dominate the population of stars on the axis and thus there stretch the velocity ellipsoids tangentially .",
    "shows the structure of the velocity ellipsoids inside a model of this type .",
    "specifically a new component was added to the  of the model with @xmath156 , @xmath85 .",
    "the  of the new component is @xmath194,\\ ] ] where @xmath149 is defined by equation ( [ eq : defsjbar ] ) . with the new component",
    "included , the longest axis of the velocity ellipsoids ( plotted in black ) points tangentially out to @xmath195 along the minor axis rather than only within @xmath196 as in the original model .",
    "this change arises because the velocity ellipsoids do not twist around as one moves outwards near the minor axis , as they do in the original model .",
    "inevitably , the addition of the new component diminishes the model s flattening : @xmath119 declines from @xmath197 at the half - mass radius to zero at @xmath198 , and the model is prolate at smaller radii .",
    "it may be that many fast - rotating early - type galaxies do contain a distinct component that comprises near - polar orbits like the model shown in , but if this is the case , it is a remarkable circumstance . in any case",
    "the discussion above makes it physically evident that jam models are far from generic .",
    "if rigorous construction of models with their presumed properties is possible , a prerequisite would seem to be a that has at least two peaks on each surface of constant energy in action space : most stars must be associated with a peak in the region of low @xmath14 and be responsible for the model s flattening , while a second peak near the @xmath199 vertex of that surface is responsible for the tangential orientation of the velocity ellipsoids along the model s minor axis .",
    "we have concentrated on exceptionally simple s. galaxies with different shapes and kinematics could be constructed using s that are either linear combinations of the s explored here , or involve other simple functional forms for @xmath0 . in particular it would be straightforward to make a model that , like ngc 4550 , has counter - rotating discs @xcite , or a galaxy that has a kinematically decoupled core .",
    "all galaxies are thought to contain substantial amounts of dark matter , and most galaxies contain stellar discs in addition to a spheroidal stellar component .",
    "it is straightforward to generalise the present models to multi - component systems : one simply chooses a  @xmath200 for each component .",
    "a very convenient aspect of this choice is that each component s mass @xmath201 is specified by the integral @xmath202 , so it is determined before one solves for the model s spatial form .",
    "the latter is done just as in section [ sec : relax ] with the  given by @xmath203 .",
    "naturally the observables of the relaxed model are obtained by integrating only over the s of the stellar components .",
    "we hope shortly to present models of our galaxy that have been constructed in this way by combining a  for of the type described by @xcite with a  for the dark halo of the type described by @xcite .",
    "we have presented a new type of self - consistent model of hot , axisymmetric stellar systems that have specified s @xmath0 , where @xmath41 is the triple of action values .",
    "the even part of the  is specified by two dimensionless parameters @xmath152 and @xmath54 .",
    "when @xmath204 the model becomes oblate .",
    "if @xmath205 the model is radially biased , while dropping @xmath152 below unity reduces the radial bias and , for sufficiently small values of @xmath152 , the model becomes azimuthally biased .",
    "the odd part of the , which does not contribute to the model s density profile @xmath206 , is controlled by two dimensionless parameters , @xmath207 , which controls the steepness of the rotation curve at the centre , and @xmath208 , which determines how fast the model rotates : increasing @xmath63 both speeds up the model s rotation and diminishes the magnitude of the azimuthal velocity dispersion @xmath139 .",
    "we focused on the observables of just two exemplary models , a tangentially biased model with @xmath156 and a radially biased model with @xmath157 .",
    "both models achieve peak ellipticities @xmath209 at about @xmath210 and are distinctly boxy when seen edge - on . in each model",
    "the velocity ellipsoids are aligned with cylindrical coordinates within the core , but beyond the core they quickly align with radial polar coordinates , and along the minor axis the ellipsoids point towards the centre rather than tangentially .",
    "we have argued that the only way to make the velocity ellipsoids point tangentially at significant distances down the minor axis is to include a distinct component of stars on nearly polar orbits .",
    "the models could provide initial conditions for n - body models that start from perfect equilibrium , something that is possible only when the  is explicitly known . since the angle - action coordinates of any point in the phase space of one of these models are readily computed , the models provide perfect testbeds for studies of galactic stability and evolution .",
    "the present models differ from schwarzschild models in having vastly fewer free parameters : four versus the number of orbits in the orbit library employed .",
    "they differ from models based on the jeans equations in providing full velocity distributions rather than just the first two moments of the distributions",
    ". it would be straightforward to extend these models in various directions .",
    "for example , it is easy to devise other approaches than simple action scaling to move from the  @xmath211 of an ergodic model to a three - integral  f ( ) , and we are currently exploring one of these alternatives .",
    "another direction in which the present work is being extended is to multi - component systems , in which stars and dark matter have distinct distribution functions , and , in the case of our galaxy , the thin disc , thick disc and halo stellar populations all have distinct s.    we started from the isochrone sphere because it provides an analytic expression for @xmath212 . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will show how to obtain a good approximation to an analogous expression for any spherical model , and thus extend the present work to other popular spherical systems , such as the @xcite sphere .",

    "the scheme for the evaluation of actions is that described in b12a except for modifications described here .",
