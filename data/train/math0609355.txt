    "<S> taking the image of a map yields a morphism @xmath13 from ( the semi - normalization of ) @xmath9 to the closure in @xmath8 of @xmath7 ( see @xcite section i.6 ) .    </S>",

    "<S> the idea of the proof is straightforward . </S>",

    "<S> , this shows that we may specialize a morphism in @xmath14 so that its image is a union of lines . </S>",
    "<S> second , we need explicit geometric arguments to deal with the low degree cases . again , in the case of the projective plane , this step is used to bring the domain to a standard form ( a chain of rational curves , rather than a general rational tree ) , while preserving the property that the image of the morphism consists of a union of lines .    </S>",
    "<S> to analyze the curves of low anticanonical degree on a del pezzo surface , we need a detailed description of their divisor classes in @xmath20 . in particular , we use the group of symmetries of the picard lattice to reduce the number of cases to treat . </S>",
    "<S> section [ sporco ] is devoted to this analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> two technical deformation - theoretic tools prove useful . </S>",
    "<S> the first is a description of the obstruction space of a stable map to a smooth surface in terms of combinatorial invariants of the map . </S>",
    "<S> this is proved in section [ conormale ] . </S>",
    "<S> the second is a lifting result that allows us , given a deformation of a component of a curve , to get a deformation of the whole curve . </S>",
    "<S> the statement is proved in lemma [ ovvio ] and the construction following it is the way in which we are typically going to use it . </S>",
    "<S> this is specific to the surface case . </S>",
    "<S> the lifting result allows us to deform a map with reducible domain by deforming only a few components at a time . </S>",
    "<S> this is done systematically in section [ rompisezione ] . </S>",
    "<S> we are therefore able to reduce the general problem to relatively few special cases , cf . </S>",
    "<S> theorem [ passo ] . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit computation of the obstruction spaces allows us to prove that in the deformations performed we never move to a different irreducible component of the moduli space .    </S>",
    "<S> the connectedness of the locus of morphisms in standard form is a consequence of some explicit computations , some of which are reformulations of classical geometric statements , such as the fact that the ramification locus of the projection from a general point on a smooth cubic surface in @xmath21 is a smooth plane quartic curve . </S>",
    "<S> this is the content of section [ pochipochi ] , but see also section [ conichette ] . </S>"
