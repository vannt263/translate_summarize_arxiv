    "one of traditions in knot theory is to study a family of knots satisfying a certain condition .",
    "examples of such families include the family of torus knots studied by dehn and schreier and the family of 2-bridge knots studied by schubert , montesinos and conway .",
    "these classes can be referred as the classes of knots and links indexed by the pairs @xmath1 of non - negative integers as defined in @xcite .",
    "a knot @xmath2 in a 3-manifold @xmath3 has a _",

    "a collection of properly embedded arcs in a 3-manifold @xmath9 with boundary is _ trivial _ if arcs in the collection together with arcs on @xmath10 joining the two ends of the arcs bound mutually disjoint disks , called _ cancelling disks _ , in @xmath9 .",
    "a @xmath1-knot can be embedded in a heegaard surface of genus @xmath5 in @xmath3 except at @xmath8 over(or under)-bridges and vice versa .",
    "torus knots are @xmath11-knots and 2-bridge knots are @xmath12-knots .",
    "clearly the family of @xmath1-knots becomes strictly larger as @xmath5 or @xmath8 increases .",
    "since an over - bridge can be removed by adding a handle and by embedding the over - bridge into the added handle , @xmath1-knots are contained in the family of @xmath13-knots .",
    "in this paper we study 1-bridge torus knots , that is , @xmath14-knots in a 3-manifold .",
    "an ambient 3-manifold necessarily has the heegaard genus @xmath0 and so it can be either @xmath15 or a lens space .",
    "the family of 1-bridge torus knots in @xmath15 contains torus knots and 2-bridge knots and is contained in the family of double torus knots , that is , @xmath16-knots .",
    "hill and murasugi studied the family of double torus knots in @xcite and parametrized the family .",
    "non - trivial knots with the trivial alexander polynomial was found in the subfamily of double torus knots that separate the double torus .",
    "they also considered non - separating double torus knots and a subfamily of 1-bridge torus knots and found various double torus knots that are fibered .",
    "every 1-bridge torus knot has the tunnel number one , but not all tunnel - number - one knots are 1-bridge torus knots . in @xcite ,",
    "morimoto , sakuma and yokota found tunnel - number - one knots that are not 1-bridge torus knots as confirmed by a condition on the jones polynomial for a knot to admit a @xmath1-decomposition in @xcite . in @xcite , they gave another criteria to determine whether a given knot has the tunnel number one and whether it is a 1-bridge torus knot .",
    "besides torus knots and 2-bridge knots , the family of 1-bridge torus knots includes berge s double - primitive knots , 1-bridge braids that classified by gabai in @xcite , and satellite knots of tunnel number one .",
    "morimoto and sakuma studied satellite knots of tunnel number one and classified their unknotting tunnels in @xcite .",
    "fujii showed that any alexander polynomial can be realized by a 1-bridge torus knot in @xcite .",
    "he also found a family of non - trivial 1-bridge torus knots with trivial alexander polynomial . in @xcite , a subfamily of 1-bridge torus knots",
    "is completely classified using their genera and jones polynomial .",
    "also cyclic branched covers of ambient spaces along 1-bridge torus knots are known as dunwoody 3-manifolds and are studied in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "is embedded in a plane except the two bridges .",
    "he in fact completely classified 2-bridge knots using this normal form @xcite . since",
    "a 1-bridge torus knot can be embedded in a standard torus except the bridge ( see figure  [ fig : exam1 ] ) , we will describe it by a 4-tuple of integers from this top view .",
    "section 2 will be devoted to simplify an embedded curve with two fixed ends on a torus up to surface isotopies that disturb neither bridges nor knot types of 1-bridge torus knots .",
    "we show that a 4-tuple of integers is enough to describe such a curve and give an algorithm to count the number of component of the curve given by a 4-tuple .",
    "we will call such a 4-tuple the _ schubert s normal form _ of the 1-bridge torus knot determined by a 4-tuple .",
    "the schubert s normal form is useful to compute the fundamental group of the exterior of a 1-bridge torus knot . in section 3 ,",
    "we give an algorithm to compute the knot group from the schubert s normal form . as a corollary ,",
    "we determine when the exterior of a 1-bridge torus knot in a lens space has a double cover .    on the other hand",
    ", a 2-bridge knot can also be viewed as a 4-plats as studied first in @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a side view and the composition of homeomorphisms of a four - punctured sphere determines the 2-bridge knot . using this description ,",
    "conway constructed a bijection between 2-bridge knots and lens spaces via double branched covers @xcite .",
    "a similar description using the composition of homeomorphisms on a two - punctured torus is possible for 1-bridge torus knots and this will be called the _",

    "since 1-bridge torus knots can be embedded in a standard torus @xmath18 except the bridge connecting two points @xmath19 in @xmath18 , we will try to classify embedded curves with two fixed ends @xmath19 in @xmath18 up to isotopies of two - punctured torus that preserves the bridge and the knot type of a given 1-bridge torus knot and extends to ambient isotopies on @xmath15 .",

    "<S> we give two types of normal forms to parameterize the family of 1-bridge torus knots that are similar to the schubert s normal form and the conway s normal form for 2-bridge knots . for a given schubert s normal form we give algorithms to determine the number of components and to compute the fundamental group of the complement when the normal form determines a knot . </S>",
    "<S> we also give a description of the double branched cover of an ambient 3-manifold branched along a 1-bridge torus knot by using its conway s normal form and obtain an explicit formula for the first homology of the double cover . </S>"
