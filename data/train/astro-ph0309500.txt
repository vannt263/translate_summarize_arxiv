    "rotational velocities and luminosities of disk galaxies combine to yield the well known tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1978 ) across several decades of galaxy masses .",
    "the break in the tully - fisher relation at velocities lower than @xmath3 km / s is removed once total baryonic masses , including gas masses , are used instead of luminosities ( mcgaugh et al .",
    "many faint disk galaxies are indeed gas - rich , with the neutral hydrogen component often outweighting the stellar mass ( schombert et al .",
    "the latter `` baryonic '' tully - fisher is well defined down to velocities as low as @xmath4 km / s , with the small intrinsic scatter possibly due to the spread in stellar - mass - to - light ratios resulting from reasonable variations in the star formation histories ( verheijen et al .",
    "the slope of the baryonic tully - fisher measured by mcgaugh et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter mc00 ) is close to @xmath5 . as the relation links the amount of baryons within galaxies with their overall potential / total mass ( through the rotational velocity ) , it reflects a tight coupling between dark matter and baryons and hence provides an important test for galaxy formation models .",
    "taken at face value the observed slope might be too steep compared to the slope of the relation between virial mass and peak velocity of halos expected in a concordance @xmath2cdm model ( @xmath6 - see bullock et al .",
    "however the baryons themselves can modify the mass profile as a result of adiabatic contraction ( blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 ) , which raises the peak velocity - an effect that must be taken into account when comparing theory with observations .",
    "the apparent break existing in the tully fisher at low velocities has often been interpreted as evidence for a strong effect of supernovae feedback that ejects baryons from galaxies ( dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "the absence of a break in the observed baryonic tully - fisher relation does not support these feedback models ( mc00 ) .",
    "however it is not clear whether this is true for even for fainter more extreme dwarf galaxies , like those that populate the outer fringes of the local group ( with measured rotational velocities lower than 50 km / s , see mateo 1998 ) . indeed , whilst the most sophisticated numerical models of supernovae explosions suggest that even at such low galactic masses only a very small fraction of the total gas mass can be removed by supernovae winds ( mac low & ferrara 1999 ; mori , ferrara & madau 2002 ) , the need to suppress the overcooling in galaxies ( white & frenk 1991 ) and the failure of cosmological simulations with hydrodynamics to form realistic disks is usually taken as a strong motivation for the need of strong supernovae winds ( navarro & white 1993 ; navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; thacker & couchman 2001 ; but see governato et al .",
    "these winds would eject significant amounts of gas in small , early forming objects , quenching galaxy formation at small scales and leaving a larger amount of diffuse , higher angular momentum gas available to form larger galaxies that will be assembled later . a low efficiency of galaxy formation , suggestive of strong feedback mechanisms ,",

    "we have to make some assumptions to derive the virial circular velocity , @xmath12 , from kinematics of galaxies or from the measured temperature of the intracluster medium .",

    "kinematical data are normally limited to the inner portion of the galaxies , hence only @xmath15 is accessible ( we discuss later the possibility that even @xmath15 has not really been measured for many dwarf galaxies ) .    for galaxies with resolved rotation curves @xmath15 is typically identified with the flat portion of the rotation curve , otherwise the half - line width is taken as a reference value ( see mc00 and gonzalez et al .",
    "@xmath12 can be than computed from @xmath15 by means of the function @xmath23 .",
    "cosmological simulations ( bullock et al . 2001 ) show that the mean value of @xmath23 changes by less than 30% between @xmath24 and a few times @xmath25 due to the mild trend of increasing concentration with decreasing halo virial mass - the mean value of @xmath26 varies between @xmath27 and @xmath28 in this mass range ; galaxies with @xmath29 km / s are expected to have a virial mass larger than @xmath30 ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) , and hence for them we assume @xmath31 as a representative value to calculate @xmath23 .",
    "the rotation curves of many dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies often suggest the presence of a constant density core instead of the inner cusp of the nfw profile ( de blok , mcgaugh & rubin , 2001a , b ; de blok & bosma 2002 ) .",
    "however , here we are not interested in the mass distribution near center of galaxies , instead we want to estimate the global parameters of a given system , and in this respect we rely on the fact that reasonable nfw fits to most of the extent of the rotation curve can be obtained provided that one uses concentrations in the range @xmath32 , significantly lower than expected in @xmath2cdm models at the scale of dwarf galaxies ( van den bosch & swaters 2001 ; swaters et al .",
    "2003a ; blais - ouellette , amram & carignan et al . 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , we compute @xmath23 for a fixed @xmath33 for galaxies with @xmath34 km / s ( note that typical concentrations for such systems , whose total mass is supposedly lower than @xmath35 , should be @xmath36 - see bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we further correct @xmath15 for the steepening of the rotation curve which would result by the infall of baryons and the adiabatic contraction of the halo during galaxy formation ( blumenthal et al .",
    "we adopt the fitting functions by mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) , which depend on the halo spin parameter @xmath37 , @xmath26 , the disk mass fraction @xmath38 and the ratio between disk and halo specific angular momentum , @xmath39 .",
    "we assume @xmath40 , namely that dark matter and baryons start with the same specific angular momentum and baryons conserve the latter during collapse . assuming the most probable value for the halo spin ( @xmath41 , see gardner 2001 ) and a conservative value for the disk mass fraction @xmath42 ( e.g. jimenez , verde & oh 2003 ) , this last correction lowers by another @xmath43 the value of @xmath12 calculated from @xmath15 . for simplicity",
    "we assume a single correction factor for all galaxies with @xmath44 km / s ( corresponding to @xmath45 km / s ) .",
    "we do not apply the correction for adiabatic contraction in galaxies with lower @xmath15 - indeed photoionization at high redshift should have reduced substantially the infall of baryons within small halos , leaving their dark matter circular velocity profiles nearly unaffected by the baryons ( quinn , katz & efstathiou 1996 ; gnedin 2000 ) .",
    "finally , when its contribution to the kinematics is non - negligible ( typically for the faintest dwarf irregulars ) we also include the gas velocity dispersion in the calculation , defining @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the 1d , line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath48 is the rotational velocity ) , which follows from the virial theorem ( swaters et al .",
    "2003b ) , and we assume isotropy such that @xmath49 .",
    "for clusters and groups we use x - ray temperatures of the diffuse hot gaseous medium to infer the 1-dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath47 , under the assumption that the system is in virial equilibrium , @xmath50 ( see binney & tremaine 1987 ) , where the molecular weight is @xmath51 ( we assume ionized gas with cosmological abundances ) and @xmath52 is the mass of the proton .",
    "the velocity dispersion is then used to determine the circular velocity by simply assuming the asymptotic relation valid for an isothermal potential , @xmath53 , which is approximately valid even for an nfw profile ( taffoni et al .",
    "we use the gas masses measured within the outermost radius for all clusters ; this radius is between 1 and 1.5 mpc and we assume that it is a good estimate of the virial radius ( if the true virial radius is larger we should only slightly underestimate the total gas mass given the steep outer slope of the nfw profile ) .    for some of the groups and clusters it is possible to compare the masses inferred from using the x - ray data and optical velocity dispersion data .",
    "we found that the agreement is very good for all clusters while for some groups , especially those whose x - ray emission is not centered and smooth , the resulting dispersions are smaller than those derived from kinematics , which in turn results in smaller virial masses .",
    "when the disagreement is strong we remove the group from the sample as this might indicate an unbound or , at least , non virialized system .",
    "we caution that the groups are the most uncertain among the datasets ; the extent of the x - ray emission is limited by instrumental sensitivity and in general a smaller fraction of the virial radius is probed ( mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the estimated gas masses for groups are simply lower limits .",
    "in figure 1 we show that a baryonic mass - velocity relation holds across the entire range of scales of virialized objects .",
    "the line shown follows the expected mass - velocity relation of dark halos in a @xmath2cdm model , where @xmath54 . to derive the latter we calculate the baryonic mass @xmath55 at any given value of the circular velocity @xmath12 as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the universal baryon fraction ,",
    "whose best estimate is @xmath58 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , and @xmath59 is the virial mass at a given @xmath12 expected for virialized halos in a standard @xmath2cdm model .    as shown in figure 1 , data and theory can be brought into a reasonable agreement once the correction for both the added baryonic mass and the adiabatic contraction of the halo are properly taken into account , contrary to previous claims ( mc00 ) .",
    "we stress that applying the correction for the adiabatic contraction of the halos is essential to reach consistency with the theoretical curve at galaxy scales .",
    "we also note that the correction accounting for different halo concentrations depends on the normalization of the power spectrum , hence on @xmath60 . here",
    "we assumed @xmath61 , lower / higher values will yield less / higher concentrated halos and thus a smaller / bigger correction to the observed @xmath15 , respectively . although a mean relation exists ,",
    "the data deviate from the simplest theoretical prediction at group scales ( near @xmath62 km / s ) and at the scale of the smallest dwarf galaxies , corresponding to @xmath0 km / s ( in particular , the best - fit curve at small scales would have a steeper slope , around -3.4 ) . in both cases",
    "the deviation can be seen as a deficit of baryons at a given value of the circular velocity ( the opposite interpretation , namely an overestimate of the circular velocity , is highly unlikely , at least for galaxies , as the observed velocities have been reduced as much as possible following the assumption that the data yield @xmath15 - if some of the rotation curves are still rising we would be underestimating @xmath12 ) .",
    "the deviation and increased scatter at dwarf galaxy scales can be easily explained as a result photoionization by the uv background at high redshift .",
    "semi - analytical models and numerical simulations ( quinn , katz & efstathiou 1996 ; benson et al .",
    "2002a , b ; bullock et al . 1999",
    "; thoul & weinberg 1996 ) suggest that gas collapse might have been substantially inhibited for objects with @xmath0 km / s once reionization begins . at even lower circular velocities evaporation of gas that had already collapsed",
    "might also take place ( barkana & loeb 1999 ; shaviv & dekel 2003 ) .",
    "these previous results may need some re - interpretation in light of a possible early epoch of reionistation suggested by wmap ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 )    in figure 1 we compare our results with the predictions from some of the highest resolution simulations of early galaxy formation that include the cosmic uv background ( tassis et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we observe a good agreement between the observations and simulations in both the scatter and deficiency of baryons within small galaxies .",
    "simulations from the same authors that also include the effect of thermal and kinetic heating by supernovae find that the minimum baryonic masses would be up to three orders of magnitudes lower than shown in figure 1 .",
    "this is also similar to the semi - analytic model predictions discussed later .",
    "one could argue that our analysis is missing galaxies with very low baryon fractions simply because they would be too faint to be seen .",
    "these objects might be purely gaseous or nearly optically dark ; a significant population of the gas - rich objects in the local universe seems to be ruled out by recent wide - field hi surveys ( zwaan et al .",
    "2003 ) , but the second possibility can not be excluded at the moment .    the simulations of tassis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) that include strong supernovae feedback predict that even fairly bright spiral galaxies , with masses well in excess of @xmath30 , corresponding to @xmath63 km / s , would have an average baryon fraction almost an order of magnitude lower than the cosmological value , lying well below the relation reported in figure 1 .",
    "therefore our results suggest that supernovae winds do not eject significant baryonic mass from galaxies .",
    "this , however , does not mean that feedback is not important as a regulating mechanism for the ambient gas temperature and density , and thus for star formation , in galaxies both small and large .",
    "= 9truecm    it is notable that the baryonic tully - fisher has such a small scatter across most of the galaxy population . as already pointed out by mc00 , variations of the stellar mass - to - light ratio due to different star formation histories would already account for most of the scatter along the vertical axis , leaving little room for variation in the imf of stars .",
    "along the horizontal axis , a scatter of 0.4 in log@xmath64 would be expected if , at a fixed value of the concentration , we vary @xmath37 in the range @xmath65 and @xmath38 in the range @xmath66 .",
    "these variations in the main parameters controlling disk formation inside dark halos already account for the entire scatter in the plot at @xmath67 km / s .",
    "cosmic scatter in the structure of dark halos alone , which translates into a possible range for the concentration of halos at a given mass , is expected to produce an additional scatter of roughly 0.2 - 0.3 in log(@xmath68 ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) , and therefore globally we would expect data points to be more scattered than they actually are .",
    "a similar problem was already argued by bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the tully - fisher relation . however , at least in our datasets , the galaxies considered are only late - type objects .",
    "spheroidal components are never dominant and this eliminates a large portion of the available parameter space , and thus of the scatter . in particular , both low spin objects ( @xmath69 ) and systems with very high disk mass fractions ( @xmath70 ) may transform into early - type spirals or s0 galaxies as a substantial fraction of their disk mass transforms into a bulge because of bar formation and secular bar evolution ( combes et al . 1990 ; mo et al . 1998 ) .",
    "considering the restricted parameter space ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) , the scatter along the horizontal axis due to variations in the conditions of disk formation reduces to less than 0.2 in log@xmath64 , leaving room for the other possible sources of scatter .",
    "the deviation at group scales is also interesting , although the interpreation is hindered by the small size of the sample considered here .",
    "one possibility is that groups contain a substantial mass of gas at temperatures @xmath73k that has not been observed because it falls below the detection limits of current instruments ( mulchaey & zabludoff 1998;burstein & blumenthal 2002 ) .",
    "alternatively , pre - heating and evaporation of gas induced by winds from agns , with an effective reduction of the gas masses bound to the groups , can be invoked ( silk & rees 1998 ; bower et al .",
    "indeed , in a scenario where there is a strong link between the formation of spheroids and supermassive black holes ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) , we can imagine that x - ray bright groups like those considered here would be affected most .",
    "we also note that even at cluster scales several points lie slightly below the theoretical curve .",
    "this might indicate that some fraction of the baryonic matter is in a warm undetected phase even at these scales , as recently argued by ettori ( 2003 ) .",
    "if galaxies have most of their baryons locked in their disks it might seem odd that observational measurements of the baryonic mass function of galaxies indicate that the latter contribute only a tenth of the total amount of baryons expected in the universe ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "however , the question here is how large a contribution do galaxies make to the total ( dark + baryonic ) mass of the universe in the first place ?    we use a large high - resolution n - body simulation to estimate the contribution of different mass scales to the total mass in a representative volume of the universe . the @xmath2cdm simulation ( reed et al .",
    "2003 ) has a box of side 50 mpc@xmath9 and the particle mass is @xmath74 , such that it has enough resolution to probe objects as small as the most massive dwarf galaxies in the local group ( a few times @xmath75 ) .    at @xmath76",
    "we integrate the mass function in different mass bins ( figure 2 ) and find for the following broad mass scales :    galaxies : @xmath77 13% .",
    "groups:@xmath78 30% .",
    "clusters @xmath79 10% .    note that among the galaxies we have not included bound systems with masses @xmath80 .",
    "these are found in the simulation and contribute another @xmath81 to the total mass .",
    "however , even assuming that they have a cosmological baryon fraction they would have baryonic masses lower than the lower limit in the analysis of bell et al .",
    "in addition , as we explained above , at these mass scales ( @xmath82 km / s ) the effect of photoionization is important - gas that might have collapsed at these scales will more likely end up contributing to a diffuse igm component ( see below ) .",
    "bell et al.(2003 ) , by measuring the mass in stars and cold gas within galaxies ( hence at the baryonic mass in their disks ) , find that the contribution of galaxies to the baryon budget is around @xmath83 and interpret this as a low efficiency for galaxy formation .",
    "however , this number is quite close to the 13% that we would estimate here for the expected contribution of galaxies to the baryonic pie under the assumption that they captured the cosmological baryon fraction .",
    "in fact , galaxies will contribute a fraction @xmath84 to the total baryonic content of the universe , where @xmath85 is the baryonic fraction in galaxies , @xmath57 is the cosmological baryonic fraction , and @xmath86 is the fractional mass contribution of galaxy - scale objects to the total .",
    "if we assume @xmath87 , using the above estimate for @xmath88 , namely @xmath89 , it also follows that @xmath90 .",
    "this actually indicates a high efficiency for galaxy formation .",
    "it is likely that galaxies have a substantial component of hot gas in an extended halo , material that is still cooling inwards onto the disk .",
    "evidence for the existence of this component is gradually accumulating , at least for the milky way , thanks to new observations of ovi and x - ray absorption ( sembach et al .",
    "2003a , b ; nicastro et al .",
    "2003 ; kalberla & kerp 2001 ) .",
    "these observations suggest that the hot gas could have a density of up to @xmath91 atoms @xmath92 between 50 and 100 kpc and that its temperature at these distances is less than @xmath93 k. further evidence for a hot halo with this density comes from the hydrodynamical model for the lmc - halo interaction and the magellanic stream ( mastropietro et al . , 2003 ) . assuming that the hot gas profile follows the dark matter ( nfw ) profile its total mass would be about",
    "30% of the disk mass , or 25% of the sum of both components . if @xmath94 of the galactic baryons are in the this diffuse halo component , then the fraction of baryons locked into the cold phase , namely in the disk of stars and gas , will be less than @xmath95 , in even betteragreement with the estimate of bell et al . (",
    "2003 ) , who are indeed neglecting any baryonic component outside the disks .",
    "= 7truecm    groups of galaxies potentially hold the largest fraction of baryons in virialised structures , whilst clusters of galaxies ( defined by mass above ) would contribute only about @xmath95 .",
    "we caution that , due to the modest box size , statistical @xmath96 poisson fluctuations in the mass function of objects are of order @xmath97 at the group scale and up to @xmath98 at the cluster scale ( see reed et al .",
    "even so , groups would always be the most important contribute most of the mass .",
    "the importance of groups for the baryon budget has been noted by many authors in the past , among them fukugita , hogan & peebles ( 1998 ) .",
    "it is now apparent why clusters and groups contain more baryons in gas than the sum of the galaxies that formed these systems .",
    "the volume from which clusters collapse is large enough to capture a large fraction of the low density igm thus giving a final high fraction of diffuse gas .    in the @xmath2cdm simulation",
    "there is also about @xmath99 of diffuse mass , which is outside of ( resolved ) virialized structures . while this diffuse dark matter component would certainly collapse in smaller structures at even higher resolutions ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ) most of these small halos are expected to be dark , thereby not contributing to the baryon budget .",
    "indeed , within halos of masses @xmath100 ( the lower limit is given by the cosmological jeans mass ) baryons can cool via molecular hydrogen at very high redshift ( @xmath101 ) but would immediately photo - dissociate h@xmath102 , halting baryonic collapse until they achieve masses in the range @xmath103 ( corresponding to a virial temperature @xmath104 k ) and can cool via atomic hydrogen ( haiman , thoul & loeb 1996 ; haiman , abel & rees 2000 ; haiman 2003 ) .    at later times",
    "low mass halos may reionize the intergalactic medium , suppressing the collapse of baryons at scales up to @xmath105 .",
    "therefore the diffuse mass in our simulations should mostly trace a truly diffuse igm baryonic component .",
    "this latter component together with gas inside , or eventually , expelled from groups by agns should make up the dominant contribution to the baryon budget , about @xmath106 according to our numbers . a substantial amount of `` warm '' gas ( @xmath107 k @xmath108 k )",
    "outside virialized structures would indeed explain the soft x - ray background ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dave et al .",
    "the same reasoning and baryon fractions in the different components would also apply to warm dark matter , or other models that have reduced power on small scales ( below @xmath109 ) .",
    "we have shown that a relation between the mass of baryons and the depth of the potential well holds across a wide range of scales , from the smallest dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters .",
    "the mean relation is consistent with the mass - velocity relation expected for most cosmological models in which dark matter halos grow and collapse through gravitational instability .",
    "deviations from the mean relation at the scale of dwarf galaxies are explained as a result of heating / evaporation from the uv background at high redshift , while at group scales we can not exclude a role of feedback from agns ( silk & rees 1998 ; kaiser & binney 2003 ) .",
    "our results argue against the existence of the `` strong form '' of supernovae feedback , namely that capable of substantial removal of baryons in dwarfs ( dekel & silk 1986 ; dekel & woo 2003 ) .",
    "we believe that it will be an interesting challenge for the standard concordance @xmath2cdm model to reproduce both the baryonic mass function presented here whilst also producing a luminosity ( and hi ) function of galaxies with a reasonably flat faint end slope .",
    "most models in which the dark matter is a collisionless component predict a mass function of dark matter halos which is much steeper than the luminosity function of galaxies .",
    "these models rely on strong feedback to give rise to a mass dependent mass - to - light ratio to flatten the observed luminosity function of halos  photoionization alone is not enough ( see benson et al .",
    "2003 ) .      in figure 3",
    "we compare our results with the predictions of the durham semi - analytic galaxy formation models that include both photoionization and supernovae winds ( benson et al .",
    "2002a , b ; cole et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the latter model",
    ", a large fraction of the energy of supernovae explosions is converted into kinetic energy , suppressing gas cooling and star formation in halos with low values of @xmath15 , as in the numerical simulations of galaxy formation by navarro & white ( 1993 ) .",
    "this has the expected result of reproducing reasonably well the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "this form of feedback is not as strong as the superwinds in benson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which can remove gas even in bright ( @xmath110 ) galaxies , but still produces objects whose baryonic content falls short of that predicted by the baryonic mass - velocity relation ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the same models do indeed provide a better fit ( within a factor of 2 ) to the i - band tully - fisher relation , which of course uses only the luminosities of galaxies ( see figure 7 in cole et al .",
    "2000 ) ; indeed strong feedback will remove most of the gas in dwarf galaxies - a larger discrepancy shows up in the baryonic tully - fisher simply because gas accounts for most of the baryons in observed dwarfs ( mc00 ) .",
    "we note that models with a truncated power spectrum at small mass scales such as would be produced by free streaming of a kev particle or through an interaction between the dark matter and photons ( boehm et al 2002 ) might be able to reproduce these observed correlations .",
    "these models should preserve the same scaling properties that allowed us to fit the baryonic mass - velocity relation down to galaxy scales , but would naturally lower the number of low mass halos such that the mass function has a linear relation to the luminosity function .",
    "a caveat in the results presented here is that measurements of both the peak velocity and the baryonic masses of galaxies are subject to several uncertainties , especially in the case of dwarf galaxies .",
    "a factor of two variation in the stellar masses of galaxies is indeed easily achieved by changing the imf of stars ( cole et al .",
    "2001 ) . in additions , the data for the faintest galaxies included in our sample ( stil & israel 2002a , b ; mateo 1998 ) do not extend far from the center such that some have rotation curves that are not clearly flat at the last measured point . in the smallest galaxies",
    "the velocity field of the gas is quite chaotic and is dominated by random motions in the outer part ( for example gr8 , see carignan , freeman & beaulieau 1991 ) such that the association of the measured velocity with @xmath15 is uncertain . in these cases",
    "we can not exclude that we are only probing the inner part of a much bigger system with much higher velocity , which would move the data points to the right in figure 3 , towards the predictions of the semi - analytical models .",
    "a similar argument has been made by stoher et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to fix the comparison between the observed number of galactic satellites and that predicted in the @xmath2cdm model . as a simple exploration of where the data points would lie if we push the systematic effects in favour of cold dark matter models , in figure 4 we show the data points after allowing both a factor of 2 increase in the true halo virial velocity ( this being quantitatively consistent with the predictions of stoher et al . ) and a factor of 2 decrease in the stellar mass of galaxies due to a different imf - the correction to the velocity is applied only to galaxies with measured velocities @xmath111 km / s since these have the more poorly determined rotation curves . in this case",
    "there is a much better agreement with the predictions of semi - anaytical models , but still not a perfect overlap .",
    "how does our galaxy fit in the picture presented so far ? according to the results of figure 1 , the milky way , in order to be `` typical '' for a baryonic mass @xmath112 , as suggested by its k - band luminosity ( kochanek et al .",
    "2002 ) , must have @xmath113 km / s , and a total virial mass @xmath114 . such a model for the milky way",
    "is plausible based on its rotation curve and on the other observational constraints available , and in particular , is in agreement with the most baryonic dominated , maximum disk models ( klypin , zhao & somerville 2002 ; wilkinson & evans 1999 ) .",
    "the additional @xmath115 of hot gas in the halo suggested by the lmc kinematics , fuse and rosat data would imply that we have accounted for all the expected baryons in the galaxy .",
    "our analysis does not include individual elliptical galaxies ( these of course enter in the global estimates of baryonic masses in groups and clusters ) .",
    "interestingly , a recent paper by padmanabhan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which uses photometry and kinematics of almost 30.000 elliptical galaxies with velocity dispersions larger than @xmath116 km / s taken from the sloan digital sky survey , finds that the dynamical to stellar masses are between 7 and 30 . taking into account that a typical elliptical galaxy also has a significant hot gaseous x - ray halo ,",
    "they conclude that these galaxies appear to have captured close to the cosmological baryon fraction , in agreement to what we find here for other types of galaxies .",
    "an additional piece of this complex puzzle is the relationship with the dynamical mass estimates of field galaxies from weak lensing ( mckay et al 2001 , guzik & seljak 2002 ) .",
    "weak lensing should provide the strongest constraints on the total mass - to - light ratios of galaxies .",
    "mckay et al . (",
    "2001 ) obtained extremely high average mass - to - light ratios , roughly around @xmath117 .",
    "however , more recently guzik & seljak reanalysed the same sdss data set taking into account the effects of clustering and cosmologically motivated models for the halo density profiles . at @xmath110 , they find a virialised dark matter halo to baryon mass ratio of 10 .",
    "they also comment that this implies a high efficiency in the conversion of baryons to stars .",
    "in other words , the weak lensing data also imply that galaxies have captured the expected baryon fraction and that feedback has been inefficient at preventing star formation and has not ejected a large fraction ( @xmath118 ) of baryons into the igm .",
    "we thank darren reed , fabio governato and tom quinn for allowing us to use their @xmath2cdm simulation , andrew benson , carlos frenk and the other members of the durham theory group for providing us with the results of the durham semi - analytical models and for stimulating discussions .",
    "we also thank frank van den bosch and andi burkert for helpful comments on an earlier version of the paper and george lake for numerous discussions on feedback ."
