    "large - scale security policy management(spm ) typically involves human security experts working to refine security policies , and a major challenge is : unseen potential threats may have already evaded intrusion detection systems(ids ) and bypassed web application firewalls(waf ) @xcite , and are recorded in web access logs , and such new and unknown anomalous patterns need to be discovered .",
    "however , without a fast discovery engine , human security experts are trapped by trying to find needles in ever growing stacks of web traffic information . the end - to - end time - to - discover(e2e ttd ) is long , the process manual and exhausting , the information load vast .",
    "for example , waf spm is still a largely manual and slow process of analyzing web access logs to identify new anomalous patterns to find potential threats .",
    "further , as web traffic grows , it is more critical to discover lurking anomalies from heavy loads of logs for security purposes .",
    "hence , we realize there is a strong need to discover and prioritize new and previously unseen and unknown anomalies for security experts@xcite .    a natural candidate for discovery and prioritization , is a recommender system .",
    "recommender systems find and recommend items of interest to users .",
    "however , most current recommender systems have two major problems .",
    "first , they normally require some combinations of the following information@xcite : ( 1)user metadata(e.g .",
    "preferred categories of items ) ; ( 2)implicit data(e.g .",
    "users binary responses to items such as `` liked '' vs. `` not liked '' instead of numerical rating scores ) , and ( 3)pre - determined similarity measurement(e.g .",
    "how similar or different two items are to each other ) , but none of such information is available in common web access log formats(sec.3.1 ) .",
    "second , despite the needed information being absent in the data source , mechanisms of many recommender systems rely on such information to fulfill the purpose of recommendation - for example , inferring and recommending items to users , based on users metadata and implicit feedback to similar items .",
    "however , when discovering new unknown and unseen anomalies , security experts are the users , and more often than not , they do not possess a prior knowledge of unseen anomalies which are about to be discovered .",
    "it is even more unlikely that security experts could give any feedback on how much they find certain unseen , unknown , and undiscovered anomalies suitable for security policy sets .",
    "further , human experts preferences for new anomalies - if any at all - are not recorded in access log formats , leaving common recommender systems unable to derive preferences and similarity measurements . when anomalous patterns are discovered from post - filter access logs , human security experts",
    "would then decided if certain security policies should be amended , but at the start of the discovery process , they would not even now what to expect .    with _ helios _ , we present a novel and interpretable recommender system , which achieves the following : +    1 .   it does not assume or rely on the availability of user metadata , implicit data , and pre - determined similarity metrics to start the process of recommending items to human experts .",
    "detailed system design in sec.3 , fig.1 , and fig.2 .",
    "2 .   it reduces e2e ttd of unknown anomalies : our experiment consistently shows _",
    "helios _ reduces e2e ttd by human experts by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "experiments in sec.4 .",
    "3 .   under minimal",
    "supervision(that is , minimal amount of labeled data ) , _ helios _ can deal with cold starts , making it suitable for exploring unknown and unseen anomalies .",
    "details in sec.3 and 4 .",
    "_ helios _ is agnostic to data sources , and can be broadly generalized : users can choose arbitrary categories , different categorical labels , different classes of entities to be measured and ranked , measurement metrics , and ranking functions to build customized anomaly discovery process .",
    "as a minimally supervised recommender system for anomaly discovery and recommendation , _ helios _ has 3 distinct stages of computation(fig.1 ) .",
    "first , _ helios _ constructs categorical combinations from discrete categorical labels in access logs , then use them to compute rank statistics .",
    "second , based on rank statistics , _ helios _ recommends categorical combinations where highly abnormal patterns occur .",
    "third , _ helios _ supplies visualizations to human security experts for interpreting rationales behind the recommendations .",
    "security experts can then decided if and which categorical combinations should be incorporated into existing security policy sets(e.g .",
    "access rules configured on waf ) .",
    "the steps are elaborated in following sections .",
    "( start ) * discover * + categorical + combinations ; ( note1 ) at ( -0.6,-1.3 ) sec .",
    "2.1 , 3.1 , 3.2 ; ( rec ) * rank & recommend * + abnormal patterns ; ( note1 ) at ( 3.2,-1.3 ) sec .",
    "3.3 , 3.4 ; ( vis ) * visualize & + interpret * rank ordering differences ; ( note1 ) at ( 6.3,-1.3 ) sec . 3.5 ; ( start ) edge ( rec ) ( rec ) edge ( vis ) ;        the short e2e ttd makes _ helios _ very suitable for ongoing spm : _ helios _ can quickly discover new categorical combinations which could be potential latent threats , and then provide interpretable visualizations(sec.4.2 ) to explain rationales in discovery process , helping human security experts make decisions .",
    "_ helios _ s scalability potential is also suitable for large - scale spm .",
    "typically , in a moderately sized enterprise system , between @xmath0 entries are recorded in access logs each hour , and the total number of log entries grows roughly linearly in time .",
    "moreover , the search space of categorical combinations is also quite large , while staying roughly constant as the time window widens . for instance , in log of a typical weekday , with only 6 common categories(table 1 ) , there can be roughly @xmath1 unique categorical combinations , not counting @xmath2 ip addresses .",
    ".cardinalities of categories [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our security expert spent @xmath356 minutes processing access log data , and @xmath354 minutes searching for potential abnormalities for one specific customer .",
    "the projection is that for each customer who demands spm , he would spend @xmath35 to 50 minutes to search for potential abnormalities . for _ helios",
    "_ , when the 3 computation components(fig.1 ) are finished , each customer s top @xmath4 most abnormal categorical combinations are already stored in a data structure . hence , more generally , as number of entities increase , e2e ttd for human experts to execute discovery and recommendation process for spm scales roughly linearly . meanwhile , _",
    "s e2e ttd remains largely constant .",
    "fig.6 compares e2e ttd between human experts and _ helios _ as number of customer who needs spm grows .",
    "suppose that one of the most abnormal categorical combinations for the customer sk is _",
    "( mobile safari , singapore , + text / plain , post)_(fig.8 ) , and one of the baseline categorical combinations is _ ( chrome , united states , image / jpeg , get)_(fig.7 ) .",
    "how does helios decide that the condition in fig.8 warrants additional human expert attention ?",
    "with 2 typical figures , we describe how _ helios _ provides relevant visualizations to give straightforward interpretations to security experts on decision rationales(sec.3.5 ) .                the thin vertical lines in fig.7(on",
    "far left close to y - axis ) and fig.8 indicate customer sk s rank position among all other customers with access log events under each categorical combination . in fig.7 ,",
    "the vertical line is close to the y - axis , indicating that under the specific baseline categorical combination , and based on the measurement metric @xmath5(count of log entries ) and ranking function @xmath6(unweighed @xmath5 sorted in descending order ) , sk s rank is 1 . in fig.8 , the vertical line",
    "is drastically shifted to the right , directly showing the visual difference that based on the same @xmath5 and @xmath6 but under different categorical combinations , sk s ranks drop dramatically and almost fall to the bottom of all customers .",
    "fig.7 represents one of the baseline categorical combinations(we provide only one such baseline graph for illustration purpose . in practice , because there are multiple baseline categorical combinations , _ helios _ provides as many baseline graphs as the number of baseline categorical combinations .",
    "the only exception is that if under a certain combination , an entity has no events in the filtered access log , then the baseline graph is not provided . ) , while fig.8 represents one of the most abnormal categorical combinations .",
    "we presented _ helios _ , a novel , non - standard recommender system for large - scale spm : it efficiently discovers unseen hence unknown abnormal patterns from web access logs . based on a generic minimally supervised method , _ helios _ does not rely on having user or item data beforehand that are commonly available to recommender systems . using discrete categorical labels from access logs to build categorical combinations , _ helios _",
    "offers a flexible and interpretable discovery engine for abnormal categorical combinations in access logs .",
    "experiments showed that _",
    "helios _ largely augments security experts capabilities to discover unknown new latent threats at large scale , and our approach has four advantages :    1 .   _",
    "helios_ discovery and recommendation mechanism is intuitive and interpretable : constructing baseline categorical combinations is similar to building queries in a sql - like grammar , and discrete categorical values are treated as content features .",
    "helios _ is flexible : users can customize baseline categorical combinations @xmath7 , class of entities @xmath8 , measurement metrics @xmath5 , and ranking function @xmath6 based on availability of priors , and then use _ helios _ to discover and prioritize unknown and unseen abnormalities . 3 .",
    "minimally - supervised , _ helios _ learns to recommend anomalies from double - sided cold starts , where no information from users or items are available .",
    "_ helios_ visualizations provide reasons of recommending certain categorical combinations as most anomalous .",
    "helios _ scales well even with limited computing resources + ( sec.4.1 - 4.2 ) , and this makes it suitable for large - scale customized spm applications .",
    "we plan to incorporate relevance feedback from the users to provide even more targeted results , as feedback can be treated as `` implicit feedback '' from the point of view of a content - based recommender system .",
    "currently , our system deals with log data from specific lengths of time windows such as 1 hour or 1 week , and we plan to build a generative model for temporal pattern analysis , based on our efficient model as shown in sec.4.2 .",
    "our further plan also includes metric learning , imputations of missing ranks , and grammar induction for semantic recommendations .",
