    "the promising field of semiconductor spintronics  @xcite has stimulated a large number of studies of spin dynamics and spin dephasing mechanisms in a vast variety of semiconductors and their heterostructures in recent years .",
    "especially the dynamics of conduction - band electrons in compound semiconductors without inversion center , e.g. , gaas , have been studied by many groups ( see , e.g. , ref .   for a recent review ) . by contrast",
    ", hole spin dynamics in these systems have been investigated with less intensity .",
    "this is , in part , due to the sub - picosecond hole spin dephasing time ( sdt ) in bulk gaas  @xcite , which arises from the strong spin - orbit coupling within the p - like valence bands . in p - doped quantum wells ( qws ) ,",
    "an _ increase _ of the hole sdt to a few picoseconds has been observed experimentally by several groups  @xcite and reproduced in microscopic calculations  @xcite .",
    "significantly longer hole sdt have been observed for optically oriented holes in n - doped qws  @xcite , and more recently in p - doped qw systems in which localization of holes occurs at low temperatures  @xcite , and also in quantum dots  @xcite . for localized electrons in quantum dots ,",
    "the contact hyperfine interaction leads to ensemble spin dephasing on the 10  ns scale  @xcite .",
    "however , due to their p - like wave functions , this dephasing process is suppressed for holes , and only the weaker dipole - dipole interaction has to be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "therefore , localized holes may be more suitable than electrons for the realization of future quantum computing schemes .",
    "additionally , the large orientational anisotropy of the hole @xmath2 factor in gaas - based heterostructures  @xcite strongly influences hole spin dynamics in tilted magnetic fields  @xcite and may allow for spin manipulation schemes based on electrical @xmath2 factor control  @xcite .    here",
    ", we present time - resolved studies of the combined electron and hole spin dynamics in a p - modulation doped quantum well under different excitation conditions .",
    "we utilize time - resolved kerr / faraday rotation  @xcite , as well as the related resonant spin amplification technique  @xcite , and time - resolved photoluminescence .",
    "we identify two processes in which spin polarization is transferred to the resident holes after optical orientation , quantitatively model the dynamics , and determine the contributions of these processes depending on excitation conditions . by fitting our theoretical model to the experimental results , we are able to find the degree of spin polarization after the optical excitation and to extract the hole spin dephasing times , as well as the degree of coherence loss during excitation at various conditions of optical pumping .",
    "we determine transverse spin dephasing times @xmath3 of almost 100  ns under weak , resonant excitation .",
    "additionally , we show that fast dephasing of the hole spin state during and just after high - power or blue - detuned pumping leads to polarization of the hole spins at zero magnetic field , while at finite fields this process competes with the polarization mechanism due to trion spin precession @xcite . as these two competing processes lead to opposite spin orientation our findings show that the spin orientation can be controlled by modifying the optical excitation conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec : sample ] , we present the sample and the idea of the experiment .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : theor ] , the theoretical model is introduced .",

    "our samples are single - side p - modulation - doped gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as qws ( qw width 4  nm ) , containing a two - dimensional hole system ( 2dhs ) with a hole density @xmath4  @xmath5 and mobility @xmath6  @xmath7vs ( measured at 1.3  k ) from a single wafer grown by molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "some samples from this wafer are thinned for measurements in transmission .",
    "for this , the samples are first glued onto a sapphire substrate with optically transparent glue , then the semiconductor substrate is removed by grinding and selective wet etching .",
    "the samples contain a short - period gaas / algaas superlattice , which serves as an etch stop , leaving only the mbe - grown layers .",
    "earlier studies of spin dynamics performed on similar systems @xcite indicate that in structures of this kind the resident holes are weakly trapped , most likely on qw width fluctuations .",
    "this is confirmed by a rapid increase of hole spin dephasing above a certain threshold temperature , associated with thermal release of the carriers from these binding centers and the onset of spin - orbit - related dephasing characteristic of free carriers .",
    "the resonant spin amplification ( rsa ) measurements are performed in an optical cryostat with @xmath8he insert , allowing us to lower the sample temperatures below 400  mk and to apply magnetic fields of up to 11.5  tesla . here ,",
    "the samples are cooled by cold @xmath8he gas .",
    "for some of these measurements , thinned samples are used and the experiment is performed in transmission ( faraday rotation ) to limit the amount of absorbed laser power .",
    "the time - resolved kerr rotation ( trkr ) measurements are performed in a helium flow cryostat , in which the samples are mounted on the cold finger of the cryostat in vacuum .",
    "a pulsed ti - sapphire laser system generating pulses with a length of 600  fs and a spectral width of 3 - 4  mev is used for the optical measurements .",
    "the repetition rate of the laser system is 80  mhz , corresponding to a time delay of 12.5  ns between subsequent pulses .",
    "the laser pulses are split into a circularly - polarized pump beam and a linearly - polarized probe beam by a beam splitter .",
    "a mechanical delay line is used to create a variable time delay between pump and probe .",
    "both beams are focused to a diameter of about 80  @xmath9 m on the sample using an achromat .    in the trkr and rsa experiments ,",
    "the circularly - polarized pump beam is generating electron - hole pairs in the qw , with spins aligned parallel or antiparallel to the beam direction , i.e. , the qw normal , depending on the helicity of the light . in the trkr measurements , the spin polarization created perpendicular to the sample plane by the pump beam ,",
    "is probed by the time - delayed probe beam via the kerr effect : the axis of linear polarization of the probe beam is rotated by a small angle , which is proportional to the out - of - plane component of the spin polarization @xcite .",
    "this small angle is detected using an optical bridge . a lock - in scheme",
    "is used to increase sensitivity .",
    "the rsa technique is based on the interference of spin polarizations created in a sample by subsequent pump pulses .",
    "it requires that the spin dephasing time is comparable to the time delay between pump pulses . for certain magnetic fields applied in the sample plane , the optically oriented spin polarization precesses by an integer multiple of @xmath10 in the time window between subsequent pump pulses , so that constructive interference occurs",
    "this leads to pronounced maxima in the faraday or kerr rotation angle measured for a fixed time delay as a function of the applied magnetic field . in our measurements , the time delay is chosen to probe the spin polarization remaining within the sample 100  ps before the arrival of a pump pulse .",
    "time - resolved photoluminescence ( trpl ) measurements are performed using a hamamatsu streak camera system synchronized to the pulsed ti - sapphire laser system . for these measurements ,",
    "the laser is detuned to create electron - hole pairs at an energy about 30  mev above the photoluminescence ( pl ) energy of the heavy - hole exciton and trion lines .",
    "the pl from the sample is collected using an achromat and dispersed in a spectrometer before being detected by the streak camera .    for initial characterization of the samples , pl measurements using continuous - wave excitation with a 532  nm laser are performed . a grating spectrometer with a peltier - cooled charge coupled device ( ccd ) detector",
    "is used to collect the pl .",
    "figure  [ fig0_pl ] shows a typical pl trace measured at a sample temperature of 1.2  k. the pl from the qw is a near - symmetrical single peak with a spectral width of about 5  mev .",
    "no fine structure of this peak , corresponding to , e.g. , neutral or positively charged excitons , is observed in pl measurements . in the same figure ,",
    "a typical spectrum of the ti - sapphire laser system can be seen at higher energy . in the following , by `` resonant excitation ''",
    "we will understand the situation where the ti - sapphire laser system is tuned to achieve maximum kerr signal . since our sample is doped , the states corresponding to the maximum of the pl emission are occupied by resident holes , therefore , the absorption at this energy is suppressed .",

    "in order to interpret the experimental results we propose a minimal , generic model that is able to account for all the features of the spin dynamics observed in the experiment without specific assumptions on the detailed mechanism of spin decoherence . in accordance with the previous experimental findings@xcite , we assume that the optical response can be described in terms of independent hole - trion systems , trapped in qw fluctuations .",
    "the state of each such system is represented by the density matrix @xmath11 , restricted to the four relevant states , representing the two hole states and the two trion states with different spin orientations ( with respect to the system symmetry axis , normal to the sample plane ) .",
    "we neglect the influence of the weak probe pulse on the spin dynamics and calculate the spin polarization at the arrival of the probe , which is known@xcite to be translated by the probe into the kerr or faraday signal .",
    "the experiment is modeled by a sequence of three steps :    first , the pump pulse transforms the initial state @xmath12 into a new state @xmath13 , described up to the second order in the pulse amplitude by @xmath14 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{\\hbar^{2}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dt\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dt ' \\left[h_{\\mathrm{l}}(t ) ,    \\left[h_{\\mathrm{l}}(t'),\\rho_{0}\\right]\\right ] , \\label{laser}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the fact that the pulse is very short compared to the spin evolution time scales and assume , for simplicity , that the excitation is coherent .",
    "here , @xmath15 is the carrier - laser coupling hamiltonian with a pulse envelope @xmath16 and @xmath17 circular polarization is assumed for the laser pulse .",
    "second , we allow for a fast partial decoherence of the hole spin which takes place on time scales much shorter than the subsequent spin dynamics and is therefore modeled as instantaneous .",
    "this leads to a system state @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 and the upper ( lower ) sign is for @xmath22 .",
    "the factors @xmath23 and @xmath24 describe the effects of occupation relaxation and additional pure dephasing in the reference frame associated with the system symmetry axis ( coinciding with the axis of optical orientation ) , which is the relevant one here in view of the fast character of the process , as compared to the larmor precession .",
    "it should be noted that the combination of coherent excitation and instantaneous dephasing does not necessarily reflect the actual microscopic kinetics of the system . in particular , for off - resonant excitation",
    ", hole spin flips during relaxation to low - energy states are also possible .",
    "while this process is clearly beyond our four - level model , its essential effect is bringing the hole spin polarization towards equilibrium and dephasing of the hole spin coherence .",
    "both these effects are included in our model in terms of the instantaneous relaxation and dephasing factors @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in the third stage ,",

    " was averaged according to a gaussian distribution of hole @xmath2-factors with the standard deviation @xmath99 .",
    "in this section we present the results of trkr and rsa measurements and interpret them , based on the theoretical model presented in the previous section .",
    "we first discuss the kerr measurements at zero magnetic field and then the rsa results .",
    "first , we investigate the trkr measurements at zero magnetic field . here , we performed two series of measurements : as a function of the pump frequency detuning and as a function of the pump pulse power .    in the frequency detuning series , performed at a fixed sample temperature of 15  k , the excitation wavelength was tuned from near - resonant excitation to higher laser energy , which resulted in non - resonant excitation conditions .",
    "figure [ trkr_lambda](a ) shows three trkr traces for resonant excitation and two different values of laser energy detuning ( symbols ) . while the trace for resonant excitation shows a near - monoexponential decay , the two traces measured using larger laser energies display a more complex behavior , with a very rapid initial decay of the signal and a zero crossing , followed by a slower decay of the negative signal .",
    "additionally , we note that the kerr signal amplitude decreases as the laser energy is detuned from the resonance , limiting the detuning range accessible in the measurements to about 7  mev .",
    "this is due both to a reduced absorption of the pump pulse and to the spectral dependence of the kerr rotation of the degenerate probe pulse .",
    "we interpret the traces as follows : under resonant excitation conditions in the absence of a magnetic field , both the optically oriented electrons _ and _ the optically oriented holes retain their spin orientation during the photocarrier lifetime .",
    "electrons recombine with holes that have a matching spin orientation according to the selection rules , thereby removing the optically created spin polarization from the sample during recombination .",
    "therefore , no hole spin polarization is transferred to the resident holes . by contrast , under non - resonant excitation conditions , a fraction of the hole spin polarization is rapidly lost .",
    "this can result from hole spin flips during energy relaxation of the optically created holes or from the thermalization of the spin orientation of the resident holes resulting from binding part of the oppositely oriented holes with the optically created excitons into trions .",
    "on the other hand , the electrons seem to retain their spin orientation . upon recombination , these spin - polarized electrons _",
    "remove _ holes with matching spin polarization from the partly depolarized hole system , leaving an excess of holes oriented opposite to the optically created hole spin orientation ( we will refer to this opposite orientation as _ negative _ ) .",
    "we note that both the spin - polarized electrons and holes created by interband absorption of circularly polarized light will lead to the same kerr rotation of a test beam , so that _ a priori _ , the observed kerr rotation does not allow us to identify the type of spin - polarized carriers directly .",
    "the origin of the kerr signal can be determined by applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the spin polarization and observing the spin precession , using the different @xmath2-factors of electrons and holes .",
    "naturally , in the case of a doped sample like our 2dhs , investigating the kerr rotation after photocarrier recombination , so that only the resident carriers remain , also gives unambiguous results .",
    "the experimental traces are well - reproduced by eq .",
    "( the fits are shown as solid lines in fig .",
    "[ trkr_lambda](a ) ) in the whole time range except for the first few picoseconds after excitation , in which the rapid initial dephasing of the holes occurs , which is not modeled in a time - resolved manner in the theory . from the least - squares fit parameters , we are able to extract the ratio of the hole and electron ( trion ) spin polarizations , @xmath101 ( see eq .  ) after the initial dephasing , before photocarrier recombination occurs . fig .",
    "[ trkr_lambda](b ) shows the calculated results as a function of the laser energy detuning from resonance .",
    "we see that , for resonant excitation , the ratio is close to @xmath102 , indicating a hole spin polarization almost equal to and oriented opposite to the electron spin polarization . as the laser energy is increased , this ratio is reduced significantly but does not reach zero , indicating that some part of the optically oriented holes retain their spin orientation during energy relaxation . for all values of the detuning",
    ", we also extract the trion ( electron ) spin decoherence time @xmath103 , and the hole spin dephasing time , @xmath104 , from the fits to experimental data using eq .  .",
    "their values , depicted in fig .  [ trkr_lambda](c ) , remain nearly constant throughout the investigated detuning range , indicating that the photocarrier and hole spin dynamics are not strongly influenced by the initial energy relaxation of non - resonantly excited carriers .",
    "it is also clear that the electron ( trion ) spin life time remains close to the photocarrier recombination time .",
    "using trpl , we measure a photocarrier recombination time of about 175  ps at a temperature of 15  k , using nonresonant excitation with larger detuning than during the trkr measurements .",
    "as the recombination time increases with detuning  @xcite , this value only provides an upper bound for the photocarrier lifetime under the excitation conditions in the trkr measurements .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the electron spin coherence time is mostly limited by the carrier lifetime for weak , nonresonant excitation .",
    "next , we discuss power - dependent trkr measurements . for this series ,",
    "the pump power was increased , relative to the values used in the previous series , by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "figure [ trkr_power](a ) shows three trkr traces for different excitation powers .",
    "the laser excitation energy was chosen to be near - resonant and kept fixed throughout the series , the sample temperature was 10  k. while for weak pumping , the trkr traces show almost no negative part , it becomes quite pronounced for higher pump powers and the subsequent decay of the negative signal becomes more rapid .",
    "as in the previous measurement series , our theory closely fits the experimental traces , except for the first few picoseconds , in which the initial hole spin dephasing takes place . from the extracted ratio of hole and electron spin polarization we see that for weak , near - resonant pumping , the hole spin polarization is significantly larger than for stronger pumping ( figure [ trkr_power](b ) ) , most likely indicating the importance of spin non - conserving carrier - carrier scattering for rapid hole spin decoherence .",
    "we also observe that the long - time hole and trion spin dephasing times _ decrease _ as the pump power is increased .",
    "this decrease is rather weak ( by about a factor of 2 over more than two orders of magnitude of the pulse power ) and may be due to sample heating by the pump beam . a rapid decrease of the hole spin dephasing time with temperature has been observed previously by several groups  @xcite .",
    "the decreasing trion spin lifetime observed in the power - dependent experiments is not limited by faster photocarrier recombination , as we observe in trpl under nonresonant excitation conditions that the photocarrier recombination time in our sample _ increases _ as the temperature is raised , from 150  ps at 4  k to 400  ps at 40  k. such an increase is typically observed in the low temperature - regime for intrinsic , as well as p- or n - doped qw structures  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the reduction of the trion spin lifetime must be caused by spin - related decoherence processes .",
    "most likely , this is due to an increased effective _ k _ vector which leads to larger spin - orbit fields and more rapid dephasing via the dyakonov - perel mechanism  @xcite .",
    "( color online ) the measured rsa traces for resonant and off - resonant excitation conditions at low excitation power , for three different values of pump pulse detuning.,width=321 ]    we now turn to the resonant spin amplification measurements .",
    "all series of measurements were performed at a nominal sample temperature of 1.2  k in voigt geometry . in this temperature range",
    ", we previously observed hole spin dephasing times above 70  ns  @xcite , which exceed the laser repetition period and lead to well - defined rsa signals . figure  [ fig : exp - wl ] shows the two principally different shapes of the rsa traces we observe in experiment : for resonant excitation conditions ( lower curve ) , in which the optically oriented hole spin polarization is conserved during the photocarrier lifetime , the rsa traces have a characteristic , batwing - like shape , and the maximum at zero magnetic field is absent .",
    "this peculiar shape arises from the process in which the spin polarization of optically oriented holes is turned into the resident hole spin polarization after recombination  @xcite : at zero magnetic field , the optically oriented hole spin polarization is removed by photocarrier recombination , as described above . with an applied in - plane magnetic field , however , the strongly different g factors of electrons and holes lead to incommensurate precession of the optically oriented spin polarizations , allowing the electrons to recombine with unpolarized , resident holes , so that some hole spin polarization remains in the sample after photocarrier recombination .",
    "this hole spin polarization is oriented in the same way as the optically created holes ( which we will refer to as the _ positive _ orientation ) . if the hole precession frequency is an integer multiple of the laser repetition rate this spin polarization is resonantly magnified to yield pronounced , equally spaced peaks in the rsa signal .",
    "their magnitude grows as the magnetic field increases due to the increased efficiency of the aforementioned initialization process .",
    "the decay of the rsa peak height with further increase of the magnetic field stems from hole ensemble dephasing due to the @xmath2-factor inhomogeneity  @xcite .    for off - resonant excitation ,",
    "when a substantial part of the optically oriented hole spin polarization dephases before photocarrier recombination ( as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results - kerr ] above ) , the rsa signal shape becomes more complex , as the middle and upper traces in fig ,  [ fig : exp - wl ] show .",
    "here , we observe rsa peaks also at zero magnetic field , and the amplitude of these peaks initially decreases at low fields . for a certain field , we observe a change of polarity of the rsa peaks , then the rsa peak amplitude first increases , then decreases again .",
    "these observations can be understood in the following way : for zero magnetic field , a fast partial re - equilibration of the hole spin polarization leads to negative final polarization of the resident holes due to removal of the optically aligned holes by spin - conserving electrons upon recombination , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results - kerr ] . as the hole spins are static in the absence of precession at @xmath100 , the spin polarization created in this way by subsequent pump pulses constructively interferes , leading to the observed negative zero - field peak . at non - zero fields ,",
    "this process competes with the spin alignment due to the trion precession discussed above , which effectively leads to randomization of the trion spin orientation at the moment of recombination so that recombination with an oppositely oriented hole becomes possible . as a result of this process",
    ", an excess population of optically oriented holes is left behind after recombination , which results in a positive spin orientation .",
    "obviously , this mechanism is only effective at non - zero magnetic fields and its role increases as the field grows .",
    "this increasing compensation between these two processes is manifested by reduced negative rsa peak amplitudes at growing fields , visible in the upper trace in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp - wl ] . at a certain magnetic field ,",
    "the precession - related hole spin initialization process becomes dominant , leading to a positive spin orientation of the resident holes .",
    "hence , we observe the polarity change in the rsa peaks . for even larger magnetic fields ,",
    "reduced rsa peak height is again observed due to the inhomogeneous ensemble dephasing .",
    "the competition of the two orientation processes leading to opposite spin polarizations is reflected in our theory by the factor @xmath105 in eq .   which ( apart from the inhomogeneous dephasing ) determines the envelope of the rsa response .",
    "the hole spin relaxation which tends to re - equilibrate the hole spin polarization after optical creation of extra holes with positive spin orientation ( or , equivalently , depletion of the negatively oriented holes by binding them with the optically created excitons into trions ) is described by the first two terms in eq .  . here , according to eq .  , @xmath23 is the degree of the fast spin polarization decay during or just after the excitation .",
    "the trion precession , which leads to orientation in the positive direction , is accounted for by the third term .",
    "it is clear from the form of eq .   that a sign change of @xmath105 , corresponding to a change of the `` polarity '' of the rsa response , is possible only for @xmath106 , that is , in the presence of initial spin relaxation .",
    "moreover , the position of this transition is shifted to higher fields as @xmath107 increases , leading to a growing number of inverted rsa peaks in the low field region .",
    "the growing number of inverted peaks is clearly seen in fig .  [ fig : exp - wl ] : for increasing laser detuning , first a single negative rsa peak at zero field develops , then additional peaks of the same orientation are seen , so that the magnetic field for which a crossover between the initialization mechanisms occurs is increased .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the increasing detuning of the pump pulse towards higher energies leads to increased initial spin relaxation .",
    "this is in fact expected , as off - resonant excitation supplies extra energy to the system leading to additional relaxation processes that usually take place on picosecond time scales and can lead to spin flips .",

    "underlying the fitting , we assume that the intrinsic dephasing rates are constant in the relevant range of the magnetic field",
    ". this amounts to assuming that the spectral densities of the reservoir coupled to the hole spins are constant in the corresponding range of frequencies .",
    "this is true in particular for an ohmic reservoir in the high temperature regime , which is the case here as @xmath108 in the whole range of magnetic fields studied .",
    "examples of least squares fits obtained in this way for the positive - field parts of some of the measured rsa traces are presented in fig .",

    "the modeling result ( blue line ) not only reproduces all the features of the experimental rsa traces ( red points ) but also yields values that are quantitatively close to the measurement results .",
    "this good agreement allows us to extract the values of various physical characteristics of the hole spin system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsa - wavelength](b ) , we show the value of the transverse spin dephasing time , @xmath109 .",
    "this intrinsic dephasing time increases for decreasing detuning and saturates for low detunings at about 100  ns .",
    "the intensities of the fast decoherence and the ratio of hole and trion spin polarization are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsa - wavelength](c ) .",
    "the ratio of hole and trion spin polarization reaches -1 as the resonance is approached .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the rapid initial dephasing induced by the off - resonant excitation at low temperatures leads only to a small loss of the optical orientation which disappears completely at resonance . on the contrary ,",
    "the dephasing factor @xmath110 remains finite even at the resonance .",
    "this is due to the fact that spin dephasing is induced by an optical excitation due to selective coupling of the light field to one of the spin states ( according to the selection rules ) @xcite . from our fitting",
    "we conclude that the @xmath2-factor tends to increase slightly with growing detuning ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rsa - wavelength](d ) ) .",
    "the same holds true for the standard deviation of the ensemble @xmath2-factor distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rsa - wavelength](e ) ) . both of these effects may be explained by a reduced absorption of the pump pulse as the detuning is increased , leading to a reduction of the sample temperature , and a smaller spin - polarized hole ensemble .",
    "a shift of the hole @xmath2 factor to larger absolute values with temperature reduction has already been observed by syperek et .",
    "@xcite a smaller ensemble of spin - polarized holes is more susceptible to @xmath2 factor inhomogeneity which arises from local fluctuations of , e.g. , the qw width or the disorder potential .",
    "the theoretical curves turn out to be sensitive to all the model parameters except for @xmath111 .",
    "the latter affects the shape of the curves only at very low magnetic fields since , according to eqs .   and",
    ", it can be neglected when @xmath112 which holds already in the vicinity of the first peak .",
    "the values of @xmath111 obtained for non - zero detuning range from 0.012 to 0.03  ns@xmath113 , which corresponds to about 50% of the value of @xmath114 ( except for the largest detuning , where @xmath111 is lower ) .",
    "this suggests that the spin decoherence is dominated by the in - plane dephasing , described by the rate @xmath115 , as opposed to the relaxation of the projection on the structure normal ( described by @xmath116 ) .",
    "this is expected for heavy holes , as the relaxation of the axial component would involve a spin transfer of @xmath117 and therefore should be suppressed .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp - pow](a ) , similar effects in the rsa traces are observed for increasing pump power at resonant excitation conditions : first , a zero - field peak appears in the rsa traces , then additional peaks are observed for higher pump powers .",
    "again , our theory allows us to precisely model the shape of the experimental rsa traces and to extract the fast dephasing parameters and the hole spin dephasing time . here , we attribute the growing fast dephasing , indicated by the reduction of the ratio of hole and trion spin polarization ( fig .  [",
    "fig : exp - pow](c ) ) , to the considerably increased amount of energy pumped into the system .",
    "this leads to an increased density of various excitations and , in consequence , to stronger spin non - conserving scattering , in the time window before photocarrier recombination takes place , as observed in the trkr measurements .",
    "an increase of the pump power also influences the spin dephasing time , @xmath3 , of the resident hole spins , i.e. , the spin dynamics after photocarrier recombination , most likely due to sample heating , as can be seen in the drastic reduction of @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exp - pow](b ) ) .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the fact that the hole @xmath2 factor slightly _ decreases _ with increasing pump power ( not shown ) , as expected for an increasing sample temperature .",
    "we have performed a time - resolved study of hole spin dynamics in a p - modulation doped quantum well under different excitation conditions . in time - resolved kerr rotation measurements at zero magnetic field , we observed the appearance of a hole spin polarization oriented opposite to the optically oriented holes for non - resonant or high - intensity excitation conditions .",
    "in resonant spin amplification measurements under non - resonant or high - intensity excitation conditions , we observe a competition between two different initialization processes for a resident hole spin polarization , which leads to a complex shape of the rsa traces and to the appearance of inverted spin polarization at low magnetic fields .",
    "negative spin orientation was earlier observed in luminescence from @xmath118-doped quantum dot systems under off - resonant excitation @xcite .",
    "our kerr rotation and rsa results show that it is possible not only to optically polarize hole spins in a @xmath119-doped system but also to control the sign of this polarization by changing _",
    "either _ the excitation conditions _ or _ the magnetic field .",
    "we developed a theoretical model which quantitatively describes the time - resolved kerr and rsa signals and allows us to attribute the spin polarization at zero field to a decoherence - assisted process in which the hole spin polarization partly relaxes towards equilibrium within a very short time after a high - power or off - resonant excitation .",
    "the very good agreement obtained between the measurement data and the model results allows us to extract the parameters relevant to the hole spin dynamics , including the ratio of hole and electron spin polarizations after optical orientation , the intrinsic ( homogeneous ) spin coherence time @xmath120 , and the @xmath2-factor distribution in the ensemble .    remarkably , rapid initial hole spin dephasing on the few - picosecond timescale and long hole spin dephasing times reaching a hundred nanoseconds coexist under off - resonant excitation conditions in low magnetic fields at low temperatures .",
    "thus , our findings open the way to optical spin orientation under conditions that assure a long lifetime of the oriented hole spins .",
