    "the electromagnetic production of electron - positron pairs in relativistic heavy ion collisions has gained some interest recently due to the observation that the total probability violates unitarity if calculated in lowest order even for realistic energies and impact parameters as large as the compton wavelength @xcite .",
    "it can be expected therefore that higher - order effects  especially the multiple - pair production  are of importance .",
    "several models have been used in order to cure the unitarity violation and predict multiple - pair probabilities , based on the summation of some subclasses of diagrams@xcite .",
    "all authors find that the pair multiplicity can be approximated by a poisson distribution and that the lowest - order results should be interpreted as the pair multiplicity .",
    "unitarity is no longer violated due to the inclusion of the vacuum amplitude , which reduces all @xmath0-pair probabilities by the same factor .",
    "recently ionescu @xcite has proposed a model , which differs from the previous ones , but which is not applicable for multiple - pair production .",
    "we are going to extend these existing models into two directions : first we address the question how the @xmath0-pair creation amplitude is exactly reducible to one - pair creation amplitudes and what approximations are necessary in order to get the poisson distribution .",
    "we then compare with earlier results .",
    "secondly we study higher - order processes contributing to the lowest - order one - pair creation amplitude .",
    "we concentrate on multiple - particle effects , which have not been included in previous models .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : in sec .",
    "[ feynman ] we show that the @xmath0-pair creation amplitude can be written as an antisymmetrised product of reduced one - pair creation amplitudes and the vacuum amplitude . for this",
    "we use feynman boundary conditions for the fermion field .",
    "neglecting contributions from exchange terms in the calculation of the total probability we get a poisson distribution for the total @xmath0-pair probability quite easily . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pertubation ] the same result is derived using the perturbation expansion of the @xmath2-matrix , which gives us some insight into the processes contributing to the reduced pair creation amplitude and the vacuum amplitude . finally we compare in sec .  [",
    "sec : comparision ] our results with other existing ones .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : magnus ] we derive the general form of the @xmath2-operator in second - order magnus theory and use it in sec .",
    "[ sec : highercorr ] in order to extract from this the lowest - order multiple - particle correction to the one - pair creation probability .",
    "this correction is then calculated in sec .",
    "[ bornzero ] based on our analytic form of the differential pair creation amplitude in second - order born approximation for impact parameter @xmath1 zero@xcite .",
    "the same calculation is used also to study the deviation of the total two - pair creation probability from the poisson distribution , which is found to be rather small .",
    "results of these calculations together with conclusions are then summarized in sec .",
    "[ results ] .    in the appendix",
    ", we show a way to calculate the coefficients appearing in the magnus theory expansion , which can therefore be calculated to arbitrary order .    throughout this paper , we treat the fields of the heavy ions as external fields .",
    "we neglect the electromagnetic interaction between electrons and positrons .",
    "this seems to be justified for almost all fermions , apart from electrons and positrons , which are produced with very low relative velocitiy , and even in a bound @xmath3@xmath4 state , due to the smallness of the coupling constant @xmath5 between the fermions compared to the effective coupling constant @xmath6 for the interaction with the external field . due to these assumptions ,",
    "our many particle system is essentially a system of independent fermions in an external field .",
    "for such a system the @xmath2 operator is known to be of the form of a time - ordered exponential @xmath7 \\psi(x ) : \\right\\ } \\label{intro : smatrix } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the hamiltonian in the interaction picture .",
    "this form of the @xmath2 operator is the starting point for our calculations .",
    "the general theory of a fermion interacting with an external electromagnetic field is rather old and has been developed already from the beginning of qed .",
    "it has been developed especially by feynman @xcite and schwinger @xcite .",
    "an overview can also be found in @xcite .",
    "although we discuss only the electromagnetic pair production by heavy ion collisions , the general theory can also be applied to other pair production processes in external fields , for example , pair creation due to bremsstrahlung@xcite .",
    "the amplitude for the @xmath0-pair creation is given with the help of the @xmath2 operator above as @xmath9 as we want to calculate pair creation , the initial state is the vacuum state @xmath10 and the final state an @xmath0-pair state given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the electron quantum numbers , for example , momentum and spin , and @xmath13 the same for the positrons .",
    "the @xmath2 matrix is therefore @xmath14    if we neglect the interaction of the electrons and positrons among each other , we are essentially dealing with a system of independent particles",
    ". therefore the field operator at any given time is linearly connected to its value at the boundary .",
    "as we can decompose the field operator into creation and annihilation operators , the same is also true for them .",
    "using retarded boundary conditions this means that the creation and annihilation operators for electrons and positrons at @xmath15 are connected through a unitary matrix with those at @xmath16 . in the interaction picture",
    "this transformation is expressed as    @xmath17    the main idea is now not to use these boundary conditions but feynman boundary conditions instead .",
    "these are of a mixed retarded and advanced type . with these the electron creation operators for @xmath18",
    "are connected with the electron creation operators for @xmath16 and the positron annihilation operators for @xmath18 .",
    "this corresponds to the stckelberg - feynman interpretation of electrons moving forward , positrons moving backwards in time . again in the interaction picture this is written as @xcite @xmath19 it has been shown already by feynman that these boundary conditions are completely equivalent to the retarded ones , but that they are better suited for qed @xcite . for this relation to be applicable , we assume also that the external field vanishes asymptotically .",
    "similar relations exist for all other creation and annihilation operators also ; eq .",
    "( [ feynman : bps ] ) is the only relation we will need in the following . applying it to @xmath20 we get for @xmath21 : @xmath22    \\left| 0 \\right > { } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the @xmath23 operator annihilates the vacuum state , therefore we drop this term : @xmath24 using the fact that @xmath25 anticommutes with @xmath26 and @xmath27 we get @xmath28    now one replaces @xmath25 using again eq .",
    "( [ feynman : bps ] ) and then commutes the next @xmath29 to the most right . doing this for all @xmath29 we finally get : @xmath30    the vacuum expectation value can be calculated easily using the anticommutation relations @xmath31 in order to move @xmath27 to the left , until it reaches the left side , where it annihilates the vacuum . doing this for all creation operators we see that we get a nonvanishing result only , if every @xmath32 is equal to some @xmath33 , and the overall sign of the vacuum expectation value is equal to the signum of the permutation to arrange @xmath34 in the same sequence as the corresponding @xmath35 .",
    "we get @xmath36 and therefore for @xmath21 : @xmath37 where the sum consists of @xmath38 terms .",
    "this can also be written formally as @xmath39 { } .\\ ] ]    this is the main result , which we will use .",
    "the @xmath0-pair creation amplitude can be written as an antisymmetrised product of the @xmath40 times the vacuum amplitude .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath40 are just the one - pair creation amplitudes divided by the vacuum amplitude . in the following we call this amplitude the `` reduced '' amplitude .",
    "normally the vacuum amplitude does not show up in calculations , as it is often of magnitude one , for example , for time independent systems . in our case",
    "the external fields are explicitly time dependent , therefore the vacuum amplitude can not be neglected .",
    "this can be understood easily , if one notices that the vacuum amplitude is the amplitude for the `` no pair creation process '' , that is , the probability amplitude for the vacuum to remain the vacuum . as pair creation",
    "does occur , this probability must be smaller than one and therefore the amplitude has to be of magnitude less than one .",
    "also we see here that the vacuum amplitude appears as a factor in all @xmath0-pair amplitudes and therefore reduces all these amplitudes by the same factor .    from this we can get easily an approximate poisson distribution for the total @xmath0-pair probability , which has also been found by earlier calculations .",
    "for this we need the absolute value squared of @xmath21 .",
    "as @xmath21 consists of @xmath38 terms , we get a total of @xmath41 terms . in most of these terms",
    "we have the product coming from two different permutations .",
    "normally the produced electrons and positrons are correlated to some extent with each other .",
    "if we therefore assume that terms , where two different permutations appear , are much smaller than those with the same permutation and can therefore be neglected , we get only @xmath38 terms : @xmath42 summing or integrating now over all states we get for the total probability @xmath43 where the factor @xmath44 has been introduced in order to correct for the multiple summation over electrons and positrons .",
    "as every term in the sum over @xmath45 gives the same result , we get @xmath46^n \\nonumber\\\\ & = & p(0 ) \\frac{\\left [ p_{\\rm total}^r \\right]^n}{n ! } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 the `` no pair '' probability and @xmath48 the total reduced one - pair probability .",
    "this is just a poisson distribution , and @xmath47 can be calculated using the fact that the sum over all @xmath0 has to be one : @xmath49^n}{n ! }",
    "= p(0 ) \\exp\\left[p_{\\rm total}^r\\right ] = 1 { } .\\ ] ] from this we finally get @xmath50 \\frac{\\left [ p_{\\rm total}^r \\right]^n}{n ! } { } .\\ ] ]    the only approximation that was necessary in order to get this result was the neglection of all `` exchange terms '' in the calculation of the probability .",
    "we show later that at least for the two - pair creation this neglection seems to be justified .    therefore for the calculation of the @xmath0-pair creation probability it suffices to calculate the reduced one - pair creation probability .",
    "all other probabilities are given then by the poisson distribution .",
    "if one wants to go beyond the poisson distribution , it suffices to calculate the reduced one - pair creation amplitude and the vacuum amplitude .",
    "this derivation is rather simple , but it is not useful for explicit calculations .",
    "especially the nature of the processes contributing to the reduced pair creation amplitude as well as the vacuum amplitude remains unexplained .",
    "therefore we derive the same result in the next section using the perturbation - theory expansion of the @xmath2 operator together with the wick theorem .",
    "in this section we use the field operator @xmath51 directly instead of the creation and annihilation operators as in the previous section , that is , we are going to calculate @xmath52 where the initial state is again the vacuum @xmath10 , and the final state is @xmath53 here we have made use of the frequency parts of the field operators for electrons and positrons .",
    "the electron coordinates are @xmath54 , the positron coordinates @xmath55 and the time coordinate is the same for all coordinates and assumed to go to @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath21 gives the probability amplitude in occupation number space to get electrons finally at @xmath54 and positrons at @xmath57 .",
    "we rewrite the final state a little bit by introducing normal ordering of the field operators : @xmath58 where we can use the whole field operators instead of the frequency parts , as the normal ordering together with the vacuum state guarantees that only the appropriate part of each field operator contributes . throughout the calculation in this section",
    "the dirac indices will be suppressed . in the final form",
    "we arrange the operators in the appropriate form , which is not always possible at intermediate steps , but generally dirac indices can be looked at , as if they are incorporated into the coordinates .    using the form of the @xmath2 matrix from eq .",
    "( [ intro : smatrix ] ) we get @xmath59 \\psi(x ) :    \\right\\ } \\left| 0 \\right > { } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the time , when we detect electrons and positrons , is @xmath56 , the time ordering can be extended to the whole expression .",
    "we use now the wick theorem in the following form @xcite , where @xmath60 is an arbitrary fermionic operator : @xmath61 here @xmath62 is a fixed index , @xmath63 is the permutation to put @xmath64 and @xmath60 to the left of all other operators , and the hat in the vacuum expectation value means that these operators have been removed from the expression . in our case",
    "the @xmath60 are either @xmath65 or @xmath66 and we can use the fact that @xmath67 and @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the usual feynman propagator .",

    "( [ eq : reduction : pertubation ] ) , that is , for the reduced one - pair amplitude and the vacuum amplitude .",
    "a final remark has to be made about the vacuum amplitude @xmath88 .",
    "already schwinger found out that the expression for @xmath88 is not finite due to infinities in the imaginary part of @xmath118 @xcite(see also @xcite ) .",
    "but he also mentioned that in the total probabilities we need only the absolute value squared of @xmath88 , where only the real part of @xmath118 contributes , which is finite .",
    "the results of the previous two sections suggest the following picture of the pair production : in the feynman picture the @xmath0-pair production can be described by two forms of processes ( fig .  [",
    "fig : genn ] ) .",
    "@xmath0 positron lines enter the interaction region coming from the future .",
    "they interact with the external field an arbitrary number of times , where they may change also their direction in time .",
    "finally they leave the interaction region as electron lines moving into the normal time direction .",
    "besides these processes , which are characterized each by a continuous line coming from and leaving to the future , there are also processes , which consists of closed loops . as they remain entirely inside the interaction region , they are not visible as physical processes .",
    "these closed loops form the vacuum amplitude . from this picture",
    "it is also clear that the vacuum amplitude is the same for all @xmath0-pair amplitudes and therefore a common factor in all of them .",
    "the fact that we are dealing with multiple particles only shows up in the calculation through the antisymmetrisation with respect to all electrons ( or equivalent to all positrons ) .",
    "this means that for a complete calculation of the @xmath0-pair creation probabilities we need to know only the reduced one - pair creation amplitude together with the vacuum amplitude .",
    "both can be calculated in principle using perturbation theory , where the reduced one - pair amplitude is identical to the usual perturbation series result and setting the vacuum amplitude to one , that is , neglecting all diagrams with disconnected parts .",
    "if one neglects the exchange terms in the calculation of the probability , it suffices to know the reduced one - pair creation probability , as this is the only result needed for the poisson distribution of the multiple - pair probabilities .",
    "note that according to the rules of the feynman diagrams we have neglected the antisymmetrisation and therefore the pauli principle for all intermediate states .",
    "there is a deeper reason for doing so , which has to do with the connection of the higher - order processes and the occurrence of the vacuum processes through antisymmetrisation .",
    "this is , for example , discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "let us look , for example , at a typical higher - order diagram in perturbation theory , where we would expect corrections because of the pauli principle . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pviol ] we would expect a deviation as we have two electrons , which are not allowed to be in the same state .",
    "( the same is also true for the two positrons . )",
    "but it can be shown that the contributions from this process are just canceled by those of the vacuum correction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lvac ] , where the electron in the loop and the produced electron are not allowed to be in the same state also .",
    "both processes are connected with each other , as we get one from the other , if we exchange the two electron lines or the two positron lines .",
    "this result is of a very general nature , so that the antisymmetrisation of all intermediate particles can be dropped , if we also include the vacuum processes ( again without antisymmetrisation ) .",
    "this shows that the higher - order multiple - particle corrections to the one - pair creation are connected with the vacuum process .",
    "therefore we think that these processes should be studied in more detail . especially as we know that the vacuum processes are not negligible , as they decrease the reduced probabilities larger than one to values less than one .",
    "the inclusion of these higher - order processes is straightforward in our model .",
    "as the poisson distribution needs only the neglection of the exchange terms , we can include the higher - order terms into the calculation of the reduced probability and use this result then in the poisson distribution for the multiple - pair probabilities .",
    "this procedure is consistent , as it includes automatically the higher - order corrections to the vacuum amplitude .",
    "therefore the calculation changes only the reduced probability used in the poisson distribution but not the explicit form .",
    "let us compare this result with the other models @xcite : all three models get a poisson distribution for the multiple - pair creation as well but only based on the summation of a restricted class of diagrams .",
    "studying further these approximations one finds that all of them are essentially `` quasi boson '' approximations .",
    "this means that they have as fundamental processes a pair creation and a pair annihilation process ( neglecting at the moment the coulomb scattering ) . combining these processes",
    "all previous models assume that only pairs , which have been produced together in a creation process , can be annihilated .",
    "therefore the electron and the positron are seen as an unbreakable pair , which behaves more or less like a boson . and",
    "for bosons in an external field the poisson distribution comes out exactly @xcite .",
    "even the inclusion of coulomb scattering in some of these models does not change the `` quasi bosonic '' nature of them .",
    "our calculation indicates that there are higher - order processes in which electrons and positrons do not behave as `` quasi bosons '' .",
    "these processes are multiple - particle processes in the sense that more than one electron or positron are essentially needed in an intermediate step .",
    "the fact that these are multiple - particle effects also shows the advantage of using the feynman boundary conditions instead of the retarded boundary conditions used in the dirac sea picture . in the feynman picture the production of a pair is described by a continuous fermion line , where the inclusion of multiple - particle effects presents no difficulties .",
    "the advantage of the dirac sea picture is mainly that its particle hole interpretation allows to treat the creation of one electron - positron pair in a single particle formalism . as the higher - order processes need the existence of more than one electron and one hole , this advantage of the dirac sea picture is no longer existent then .",
    "the other advantage of the feynman boundary conditions is that the different processes can be separated from each other . especially the vacuum processes are independent of the reduced pair creation processes .",
    "this is not the case in the dirac sea picture , where vacuum processes and pair creation processes can not be separated in the intermediate steps but only in the final state .    in the following",
    "we show that the processes of the type of fig .",
    "[ fig : pviol ] are the lowest - order corrections to the one - pair creation processes if we neglect coulomb scattering terms . for this",
    "we restrict ourself to second - order magnus theory .",
    "the magnus theory can be seen as an expansion in the interaction time . for large values of @xmath119",
