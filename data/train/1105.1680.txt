    "since @xmath35=[x , y,\\theta]$ ] , if @xmath38 and @xmath35=[x , x,\\theta']$ ] , if @xmath40 , the theorem is proved .",
    "@xmath112    until now , we have verified that the quantum circuit @xmath229 in figure  [ fig12 ] implements arbitrary near - trivial transformation @xmath35 $ ] for any @xmath58 ( it does not matter whether @xmath36 is equal to @xmath37 or not . @xmath28 and @xmath230 are certain fixed angles ) .    according to the analysis in proposition  3",
    ", we could replace the circuit @xmath188 in figure  [ fig12 ] by the quantum circuit @xmath220 in figure  [ fig11 ] which is an approximate implementation .",

    "it can be seen that the following two statements hold :    if @xmath38 , @xmath250|\\varphi\\rangle\\right)|x\\rangle|y\\rangle|10\\rangle|r\\rangle$ ] ;    if @xmath40 , @xmath251|\\varphi\\rangle\\right)|x\\rangle|x\\rangle|10\\rangle|r\\rangle$ ] .",
    "[ htbp ]    * remark  2 : *    \\(a ) all the gates in the above circuit ( in figure  [ fig13 ] ) are fixed gates without parameters , in other words , the circuit is in standard form of quantum circuit .",
    "\\(b ) this circuit is a polynomial - size quantum circuit .",
    "\\(c ) the exponential number of near - trivial transformations can be implemented in this single quantum circuit .",
    "quantum circuit is a very important model in the theory and experiment of quantum computing .",
    "quantum circuit model is much simple than qtm model , but is not exactly equivalent to qtm model . for example , given a quantum circuit , its running time is finite , definite and is independent of the inputs .",
    "however , the running time of a given qtm dynamically changes and may be infinite while the qtm do not halt on a given input .",
    "indeed , the quantum circuit model has more advantages than qtm model in many aspects .",
    "qtm model is the most important tool in studying quantum complexity theory .",
    "our results on quantum circuit present a basis for the further study of qtm .    in section  4 , we have constructed a universal quantum circuit implementing arbitrary near - trivial transformation .",
    "the circuit @xmath249 in figure  [ fig13 ] consists of only some generalized - cnot and single - qubit rotations in + @xmath252 . since stationary normal form qtm for these quantum gates can be easily constructed , and according to bernstein and vazirani(lemma 4.9 in  @xcite ) , we can dovetail these qtms one by one and obtain a stationary normal form qtm which could exactly simulate this circuit @xmath249 .",
    "thus , we can get a stationary normal form qtm approximately implementing any near - trivial transformation .",
    "it can be seen that the qtm we described is space - bounded qtm  @xcite , so we propose a way to construct space - bounded qtm simulating any quantum circuit . these results will be given in another paper .",
    "in addition , according to the structure of universal quantum turing machine ( uqtm )  @xcite , near - trivial transformation is an elementary component of uqtm .",
    "we believe that near - trivial transformation is fundamental in the model of quantum computation .",
    "so it is meaningful to study near - trivial transformation and construct universal quantum circuit for it .    at last ,",
    "we compare the result of sousa and ramos  @xcite with ours in two aspects : 1 ) the implementation of general unitary transformation , 2 ) the implementation of certain quantum algorithm described with cnot and single - qubit gates . from the first aspect , in order to use the universal cell of sousa and ramos  @xcite , the unitary transformation must be decomposed through the following steps : 1 ) decompose the unitary transformation into several two - level unitary transformation according to the way of deutsch  @xcite , 2 ) decompose the two - level unitary transformation into generalized toffoli gates and controlled unitary gates in the way of divincenzo  @xcite , 3 ) decompose toffoli gates into cnot and single - qubit gates , and decompose the controlled unitary gates according to abc decomposition  @xcite .",
    "through the three steps , we obtain a quantum circuit consisting of only cnot and single - qubit gates .",
    "base on this , several universal cells can be applied to the implementation of the unitary transformation .",
    "however , we construct universal cell directly proceeding from two - level unitary transformation which can be seen as the product of a near - trivial rotation and a near - trivial phase shift . in this way",
    ", it is not required to decompose the two - level unitary transformation . however , from the second aspect , the realization of certain quantum algorithm described with cnot and single - qubit gates means only simulating a quantum circuit consists of cnot and single - qubit gates .",
    "this problem has been well solved by sousa and ramos  @xcite . in this case , it is better to use their universal cell .",
    "we implement near - trivial transformation with a universal quantum circuit rather than a family of quantum circuits .",
    "this quantum circuit is constructed by means of only cnot and single - qubit rotations , and its size is polynomial .",
    "any near - trivial transformation could be encoded , then the encoding string and the quantum data are both inputs of the universal quantum circuit .",
    "the circuit has a result consisting of the encoding string and the result of the near - trivial transformation .",
    "it can be seen that , the exponential number of near - trivial transformations can be implemented using a single circuit in our construction .",
    "since any unitary transformation can be decomposed into a product of some near - trivial transformations , our result may contribute to the design of universal quantum computer .",
