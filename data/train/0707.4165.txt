    "the dust content of a spiral galaxy disk can be mapped either by the characteristic dust emission in the far - infrared ( fir ) and sub - mm regimes , or by using the attenuation of known background sources . both techniques have seen recent significant improvements in accuracy and sensitivity , with complementary results shedding light on the dusty interstellar medium in spiral disks .    the emission from the interstellar dust in the disks of spiral galaxies has been characterized with increasing accuracy by several infrared space missions ( iras , iso and , recently , _ spitzer _ ) , as well as the sub - mm observations of scuba on the jcmt .",
    "the improvements in spatial resolution and wavelength coverage have led to significant insight into the temperature components of the dust in spiral disks , and into the relation between dusty clouds and star - formation .",
    "the fir emission from spiral galaxies has revealed that the dust can be described by two dominant thermal components : warm ( 25 k @xmath0 t @xmath0 100 k ) and cold ( t @xmath0 25 k ) .",
    "both the warm and cold components can be found in spiral arms , and there is a smooth disk of cold dust between these arms .",

    "the studies of edge - on spirals by @xcite and @xcite quantified the radial profile as a scalelength of the dust that is 40% larger than that of the starlight .",
    "the contribution of the cold ism ( t @xmath0 25 k ) to the overall emission of spiral disks has been difficult to constrain because of the degeneracy between dust temperature and mass . hence , the cold ism s relation with hi and their relative distribution remain unknown .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations , mostly from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxy survey ( sings , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have already contributed greatly to the understanding of spiral disks .",
    "the relations between the tracers of cold dust ( 70 and 160 micron emission ) and star - formation , both obscured ( 24 micron ) and unobscured ( uv and h@xmath2 emission ) have already been studied with this multi - wavelength survey in several canonical galaxies and their substructure : the starburst m51 @xcite , the grand design spiral m81 @xcite , the rings of ngc 7331 @xcite and m31 @xcite , the superwind in m82 @xcite , and the dwarf ngc 55 @xcite . @xcite",

    "these studies find ample evidence of cold dust throughout the optical disks of spirals but , interestingly , also outside them in various places : on the edge of the optical disk @xcite , outside m82 s superwind @xcite and extending beyond the stellar disk @xcite .",
    "parallel to these investigations of dust emission has gone an observational effort to quantify the absorption by dust in spiral disks using known background sources . @xcite proposed using occulting galaxy pairs for this purpose .",
    "nearby occulting galaxy pairs were initially investigated with ground - based data , both images @xcite and spectra @xcite .",
    "subsequently , with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , a more detailed picture of dust in these nearby disks emerged @xcite .",
    "the results of these studies are that extinction is gray when measured over disk sections greater than 100 pc , but resembles the galactic extinction law at smaller scales  those that can only be resolved with hst .",
    "arms are found to be more opaque than the general disk , and some evidence suggests that the dust disk is a fractal , similar to the hi disk .",
    "@xcite investigated the use of the calibrated number of distant galaxies seen though the foreground disk in hst images .",
    "the calibrated counts of distant galaxies have been explored further in the previous papers in this series @xcite .",

    "+ three scenarios have been proposed to explain the discrepancy between the apparent absorption in uv and optical wavelengths and the emission of dust in the fir and sub - mm regimes :    * a young stellar population is embedded in the dense plane of the disk .",
    "this is proposed by @xcite and corroborated by @xcite .",
    "the embedded young stars pump the fir emission radiated by the dust plane . * a strongly clumped dusty medium .",
    "the clumping would lead to underestimate the dust mass from optical extinction in edge - on systems @xcite ; the dust mass would also be underestimated by a uv to fir sed @xcite . * a different emissivity of the cold dust grains higher than canonical in the fir and sub - mm .",
    "a change of emissivity has been proposed for denser ism regions @xcite or , alternatively , for the lower density regions of the disk @xcite .    in all three of these scenarios ,",

    "therefore , an estimate of the prevalent dusty cloud size for spiral disks would provide a constraint for the sed models of spiral disks .",
    "given that sed and extinction techniques are sensitive to different characteristics of the dusty clouds in the spiral disk , a comparison between the optical depth derived from these two methods has the potential to figure out the structure of the dusty ism . here",
    ", we compare the @xmath3-band optical depths for a section of the spiral disk , one derived from a sed model of the _ spitzer _ fluxes ( `` average '' ) , and one determined from the number of distant galaxies found in an hst image ( `` apparent '' ) .",

    "only the solid angle covered by the wf chips is used for further analysis ( the pc chip is excluded ) .    the infrared array camera ( irac ) mosaic",
    "is made with the custom _ singsdither _ script , by m. regan , that combines the scan images into a single mosaic using the `` drizzle '' algorithm ( fourth data release notes , * ? ? ?",
    "the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) data products are calibrated , sky  subtracted mosaics in all three bands , reduced as described in @xcite .",
    "the basic instrument parameters , pixel scale , and adopted psf fwhm for the seven main _ spitzer _ imaging modes are summarized in table [ table : data ] .",
    "two parallel estimates of the optical depth of disks are used in this paper : first , the apparent optical depth of the spiral disks is determined from the number of distant galaxies identified in the hst / wfpc2 images , calibrated with the `` synthetic field method '' ( sfm ) .",
    "secondly , the optical depth of the same section of the spiral disks is derived from the dust surface density , which is a result of the sed model fit to the _ spitzer _ fluxes using the model from @xcite .      in principle , the number of distant galaxies seen through a spiral disk is a function of the dust extinction , as well as the crowding and confusion by the foreground disk .",
    "initial applications of the number of distant galaxies as an extinction tracer were on the magellanic clouds @xcite , but they lacked accuracy .",
    "the `` synthetic field method '' ( sfm ) was developed by @xcite to correct an extinction measurement based on the number of distant galaxies in an hst image , for the effects of crowding and confusion by the foreground spiral disk .",
    "the `` synthetic field method '' follows a series of steps .",
    "first , the number of distant galaxies in an hst science field is determined .",
    "second , a series of simulated ( `` synthetic '' ) fields are made . in each of these fields , a typical background ( e.g. , the hubble deep field )",
    "is first dimmed by a gray screen and added to the science field .",
    "third , the added distant objects are identified in these synthetic fields .",
    "the fourth step is to measure the relationship between the number of these identified synthetic distant galaxies and background dimming . from this relation and the original number of actual distant galaxies found in the science field",
    ", an average opacity can be found .",
    "it is important to remake the synthetic fields for each science field because the crowding and confusion issues are unique in each case .",
    "an additional uncertainty in the resulting average extinction measurement is the cosmic variance in the intrinsic number of distant galaxies behind the foreground disk .",
    "the uncertainty due to cosmic variance can be estimated from the two - point correlation function of distant galaxies and folded into the poissonian error .",
    "the cosmic variance uncertainty is of the same order as the poisson statistical error for small numbers ( for a complete discussion on the uncertainties of the sfm , see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , single - field sfm measurements remain uncertain , but a meaningful conclusion can be drawn from a combined set of science fields .    we have applied this method successfully on archival wfpc2 data .",
    "@xcite present the average radial opacity profile of spiral disks and the effect of spiral arms .",
    "the spiral arms are more opaque and show a strong radial dependence , while the more transparent disk shows a flat profile .",
    "@xcite compare hi radial profiles to the opacity ones , and conclude that no good relation between disk opacity and hi surface density radial profiles can be found .",
    "however , @xcite find that the sub ",
    "mm profile from @xcite generally agrees with their opacity measurements of m51 .",
    "@xcite compare the relation between surface brightness and disk opacity ; this relation is strong in the spiral arms , but weak in the rest of the disk .",
    "@xcite predicted , based on simulated data , that the optimum distance for the application of the sfm with current hst instruments is approximately that of virgo .",
    "the identification of background galaxies suffers in closer disks , as the stellar disk becomes more resolved , compounding confusion .",
    "this optimum distance , combined with the availability of deep hst / wfpc2 images from the cepheid extragalactic distance scale key project , resulted in the sample presented in @xcite .",
    "@xcite confirmed the results from @xcite using this sample , with foreground disks spanning distances between 3.5 and 35 mpc .",
    "a selection effect of the key project is that the majority of the hst science fields is concentrated on spiral arms and exclude the centers of the galaxies .    here , we present average extinction values for the whole wfpc2 field  of  view , minimizing the uncertainties to the extent possible . in our initial papers , we did not apply an inclination correction to the optical depths because the correction depends strongly on the dust geometry ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "however , in this paper we assume a simple dust model in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "the appropriate inclination correction @xmath4 has been applied to the points in figures [ fig : fit ] and [ fig : n_val ] , and in table [ table : a ] . the uncertainties in the tables and figures reflect the 1-sigma confidence levels produced by the combination of the poisson error and the cosmic variance of background galaxies .      the average disk optical depth is derived from the _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "first , the surface brightnesses within the wf chips footprint are measured ( see figure [ fig : overlap ] ) .",
    "second , these are converted into a dust surface density using an sed model .",
    "third , this surface density is translated into an @xmath3-band optical depth .",
    "all the irac and mips data are convolved to the poorest resolution of the 160 micron observations ( see table [ table : data ] ) , and the pixel scale is set to 9 \" .",
    "this is done with the _ gauss , wcsmap _ and _ geotran _ tasks , under iraf .",
    "subsequently , the overall flux is measured in the wfpc2 field of view ( figure [ fig : overlap ] ) . because the l - shaped aperture is a highly unusual one , the aperture correction remains uncertain , but not negligible , since the fwhm at 160 micron ( @xmath5 ) is of the order of the aperture diameter ( @xmath6 in an l - shape ) .",
    "published aperture corrections for the irac instruments @xcite overestimate the correction for extended objects @xcite .",
    "here we use the aperture corrections for extended sources from @xcite for irac fluxes , and from @xcite for the mips fluxes ( see also table [ table : data ] ) .",
    "table [ table : flux ] gives the average surface brightnesses for the seven _",
    "channels in the field - of - view of the three wf chips of the wfpc2 array .",
    "the uncertainties are derived from the variance in the sky .",
    "generally , the surface brightnesses agree with the results presented by @xcite for the entire disks .    the second step is to convert these surface brightnesses to a dust surface density .",
    "initially , we fitted only the mips fluxes with two blackbodies and derived surface densities from these @xcite .",
    "however , a more rigorous treatment of the ir fluxes can be done with a sed model , such as the one presented in @xcite .",
    "this model uses the physics of grain heating and reradiation , and a model distribution of grain sizes and types .",
    "the updated version from @xcite has been fit to the data , and the results are shown in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the derived stellar and dust surface brightnesses , dust surface density , and mean temperature are presented in table [ table : model ] .",
    "dust surface densities are between 0.1 and @xmath7 , with mean temperatures between 14.6 and 17.8 k.    the mean dust temperatures are obtained from the mean radiation scaling , @xmath8 , ) of the local interstellar radiation field to calculate the irradiation that the grains see .",
    "@xmath8 is the average of this scaling distribution . ] in the @xcite model ( @xmath9 in their equation 18 ) .",
    "the model uses a distribution of temperatures and grain sizes .",
    "therefore the mean temperature is an indication of the thermal equilibrium point of the bulk of the dust .",
    "most of the dust is cold ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "these results are an obvious improvement over a simple single - temperature fit , but the model parameters in table [ table : model ] are still not fully constrained ; disagreement between data and model at the pah peak at 8 micron could be an effect of metallicity or the presence of a bright hii region .",
    "the 70 and 160 @xmath11 m fluxes hint at colder or more dust in the disk ( figure [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "there are three caveats to the fits : ( 1 ) a lack of sub  mm data , ( 2 ) the single color isrf used and ( 3 ) averaging over different types of emission regions , i.e. , hii regions and the general disk .    additional sub - mm data of comparable quality , needed to better constrain the model and especially the cold dust emission , will not be available until scuba2 starts operations on the jcmt and the launch of _",
    "herschel_. at present , comparable - quality sub - mm maps are available only for ngc 5194 @xcite and ngc 7331 @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss sed models with and without sub - mm data .",
    "the second caveat in the derivation of dust mass is the assumption of a constant color for the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) illuminating the emitting dust . in reality",
    ", dust grains deeper in a dust structure will encounter radiation field that is not only dimmed but also reddened and , hence , will contribute less flux to the fir emission .",
    "locally , the isrf will also depend on the age of the nearby stellar population .",
    "due to the reddening of the isrf deeper in the cloud , dense clouds could contain more dust mass in their centers than inferred from just the fir emission .",
    "additional sub - mm observations will help resolve this uncertainty in the sed optical depth .",
    "@xcite discuss fits of the model to the total fluxes of the sings galaxies with and without additional sub - mm data .",
    "they find that the fir estimate underestimates of 1.5 times the dust mass more ( 5 out of 17 cases , notably ngc 3627 and 7331 of our sample ) than overestimates it ( only m51 of the 17 ) .",
    "the third caveat is that the model values are an average over many different types of ism regions , each with a different heating mechanism , dust structure and composition ( e.g. , photo - dissociation regions , cirrus , and star - forming regions in spiral arms ) .",
    "the @xcite model s assumptions hold better for some regions than for others , but we use the results as `` typical '' for these disks .",
    "the relative contribution of pah emission to the sed is a function of ism geometry as well as irradiation and composition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "together with a better - constrained fir / sub - mm sed one could constrain ism geometry solely from the relative contributions to the sed .",
    "@xcite discuss the application of the @xcite model to whole disks of the sings galaxies .",
    "the dust surface density is translated into an average optical depth with the absorption cross section per unit dust mass , @xmath12 , and grain albedo from @xcite for the johnson @xmath3-band ( 865.5  . ) : @xmath13 .",
    "these optical depth values are presented in table [ table : a ] .",
    "it continues to be difficult to constrain dusty cloud geometry from models of either extinction or emission . in this section ,",
    "we review what can be learned , solely from the sfm measurements , about the geometry of the extincting medium . in @xcite ,",
    "two indications that the dust disk is clumpy are identified : ( 1 ) the average color of the distant galaxies is independent of the disk opacity implied by their number , and ( 2 ) the measurement of disk opacity is independent of inclination . the lack of a relation between the average opacity of the disk and the average color of the detected galaxies can be explained by two scenarios : ( 1 ) some of the background galaxies are completely blocked by large clouds , and some are not . the color measurement is done on background objects that do not suffer from extinction and , hence , reddening . alternatively , ( 2 ) _ all _ background galaxies are dimmed by clouds smaller than the projected distant galaxies . consequently , some of the distant galaxies are dimmed enough to drop below the detection threshold .",
    "any detected galaxy s color is , however , measured from mostly unreddened flux .",
    "however , we note that a relation between the reddening and derived extinction from the distant galaxies is difficult to detect because ( 1 ) the spread in colors of distant galaxies is substantial and ( 2 ) color is measured from the detected galaxies automatically the least dimmed whereas opacity is measured form the _ missing _ galaxies .",
    "the inclination effect on the apparent optical depth from the number of distant galaxies is minimal ( see * ? ? ? * and figure 3 ) . assuming a thin layer of optically thick clouds , the apparent optical depth of the disk , measured from the number of distant galaxies , is dominated by the apparent filling factor of clouds .",
    "the projected filling factor does not change much with inclination : a flat cloud covering 40% of a certain disk section still covers 40% of the inclined section .",
    "only when the height of the cloud becomes important when the inclination is closer to edge - on , does the apparent filling factor change .",
    "this explanation for the lack of an inclination effect in the opacity profiles does not depend on the size of the clouds .",
    "it could be a single , large , cloud or many small ones in the plane of the disk .",
    "however , the optical depth values in @xcite are from different sections of the disks although generally centered on a spiral arm and the effect of small inclination differences could well have been masked by comparing different regions in the disks .",
    "in @xcite we did not apply an inclination correction because it depends on the assumed dust geometry . in this paper",
    "we do assume a dust geometry and hence make an inclination correction (  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "the simulations in the sfm assume a gray screen , an uniform unclumped dust layer with opacity equal in the v and i bands .",
    "the sfm opacity measurements in this paper are based on such simulations . in @xcite , we ran a series of simulations on ngc 1365 to characterize the effect of average cloud cross - section on the number of distant galaxies observable through a disk .",
    "figure [ fig : sfmsize ] shows the effect of cloud size , expressed in pixels , on the simulated relation between average opacity and number of distant objects . in each simulation , we fix a cloud size and vary their number to increase disk opacity . an ensemble of unresolved clouds is effectively the gray screen . for clouds resolved with hst , more than 2 pixels in our data , after the drizzle reduction . ] , the relation between opacity ( cloud filling factor ) and number of distant objects becomes much shallower .",
    "the same number of distant galaxies observed would then imply a much _ higher _ opacity of the disk .",
    "because the sfm ( calibrated with a gray screen ) generally agrees well with measurements from overlapping galaxies @xcite , it seems unlikely that the disk s opacity is predominantly due to large , resolved clouds .",
    "a pixel of @xmath14 at the distance of ngc 1365 ( 18 mpc ) is 4 pc in linear size .",
    "it is therefore implied that the structure of the ism responsible for the disk opacity measured with the sfm varies in optical depth on scales of @xmath1510 pc or less .    from the sfm measurements alone ,",
    "the cloud geometry is impossible to determine . only when additional information is used e.g . ,",
    "the general agreement with the occulting galaxy technique it favors small ( unresolved ) scales for the clouds .",
    "therefore , to constrain cloud geometry , information from two different techniques needs to be combined .",
    "table [ table : a ] presents the optical depth estimates from the synthetic field method and the sed model @xcite , for the wfpc2 field - of - view .",
    "the optical depths range between 0.1 and 3.5 magnitudes in the @xmath3-band .",
    "the measurements are for different parts of different spiral disks ( figure [ fig : overlap ] ) , explaining in part the range in values .",
    "the optical depth estimates presented here may appear high for the johnson @xmath3-band , compared with other extinction estimates ( e.g. , those from inclination effects or reddening ) , but these are ( 1 ) for the entire height of the disk , and ( 2 ) generally centered on a spiral arm .",
    "typical extinction values in the @xmath3-band are several tenths of a magnitude for a dust screen in front of the stellar spiral disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "two of the derived sfm opacities are negative , possibly the effect of an overdensity of distant galaxies behind the target galaxy .",
    "the discrepancy in ngc5194 - 1 may be due to misidentification of background galaxies , as they are difficult to identify in this field .",
    "figures [ fig : fit ] and [ fig : n_val ] show the values of disk opacity by both methods , over the same section of the disk .",
    "both methods generally agree within the uncertainties of the measurements .",
    "the agreement is better than our initial estimate from a blackbody fit to the mips fluxes in @xcite .",
    "the general agreement and the mean temperature of the dust ( table [ table : model ] ) imply that most of a disk s opacity is due to the cold dust in the disk .",
    "the relation between the apparent and average @xmath3-band optical depth measurements the first from the number of distant galaxies in hst images and the second derived from the _ spitzer _ sed could reveal the nature of the prevalent structure in the ism .    the _ a priori _ assumptions are that ( 1 ) all dust structure is transparent to the fir emission from which the dust surface density is estimated in the sed model , and ( 2 ) the _ entire _ volume of the cloud emits in the fir .",
    "we adopt _ model c _ from @xcite , in which a randomly distributed series of clumps covers the area .",
    "these authors define two optical depths : ( 1 ) the typical optical depth ( @xmath16 ) , i.e. , the average optical depth that is proportional to the dust mass ; and ( 2 ) the apparent optical depth ( @xmath17 ) , or the optical depth if a uniform layer would cover the area .",
    "our two measurements of optical depth sed and sfm correspond to these two optical depths , average and apparent .",
    "an optical depth based on the sed depends on the dust mass within the area , and hence corresponds to @xmath16 .",
    "the sfm optical depth is the apparent optical depth averaged over the area , and hence @xmath17 .",
    "these two optical depths need not be the same , and their relation is an indication of how clumped the medium is .",
    "let us assume a number of small dust structures with a height ( @xmath18 ) , an average grain cross - section ( @xmath19 ) , and a grain emissivity ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the grain number density in the clouds is denoted by @xmath21 , and the average number of clouds in a line - of - sight is @xmath22 .",
    "we assume all clumps have the same optical depth @xmath23 :    @xmath24    the average optical depth ( @xmath16 ) is then :    @xmath25    and the apparent optical depth can be derived if one assumes a gaussian distribution of the number of clouds along the possible lines - of - sight and sum the contributions of all clouds ( see equations 15 and 17 - 19 in * ? ? ?",

    "the ratio of the apparent over the average optical depth is :    @xmath30    leaving only the optical depth of the clouds ( @xmath23 ) , and hence the grain density ( @xmath21 ) and the cloud size ( @xmath18 ) as the variables .",
    "our fit to the relation between sfm and sed optical depth estimates only has @xmath23 as the variable ( figure [ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "we can now use equation [ eq : rat ] to derive @xmath23 from a fit to the optical depths from sed ( @xmath16 ) , and from the number of distant galaxies ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we want to answer three questions .",
    "are the clouds in the disks typically optically thin or thick ?",
    "if all disks are equal , what is the implied cloud optical depth ? how many clouds lie typically along a given line - of - sight ?      optically thin clouds ( @xmath31 ) result in a ratio of optical depths close to unity :    @xmath32    optically thick clouds ( @xmath33 ) result in a ratio of :    @xmath34    figures [ fig : fit ] and [ fig : n_val ] show how a majority of the data exhibit a ratio of order unity .",
    "the cold dust mass in the sed model could be better constrained with additional sub - mm information @xcite",
    ". however , the ratios are , within the errors , consistent with optically thin clouds in most of the disks .",
    "figure [ fig : fit ] shows the fit to the ratios of apparent to average optical depths , with @xmath23 as the single fit parameter , as per equation [ eq : rat ] . for simplicity , we assume here that all disks are made up of similar clouds , and that there is no difference between arm and disk regions .",
    "the negative sfm measurements are excluded from the fit .",
    "the best fit is for a cloud optical depth of @xmath350.4 with , on average , 2.6 clouds along the line - of - sight ( if the two negative points are included , the values change , respectively , to @xmath23 = 0.56 and n = 1.9 ) .",
    "the inferred value of @xmath23 is likely to be a mean between higher values in spiral arms and much lower values in the disk .",
    "optically thick disks have more clouds along the line of sight , while optically thin disks harbor a single cloud .",
    "reasonable values for the parameters in equation [ eq : tc ] are : @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 @xcite ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath40 was fixed at 2 in the @xcite models . ] .",
    "the value of 0.4 for @xmath23 implies a cloud height , @xmath18 , of @xmath15 60 pc !",
    "much larger clouds could be resolved in extinction maps of these disks based on stellar reddening . in the case of ngc 3627 ,",
    "ngc 5194 , ngc 6946 and ngc 7331 , there is a clear spiral arm in the reddening map @xcite ; the other reddening maps are smooth or do not extend out to cover the whole wfpc2 pointing .",
    "a more likely scenario is that there is an inverse relation between the cloud density @xmath21 and scale @xmath18 .",
    "such a relation can be seen in giant molecular clouds ( gmc ) of our own galaxy ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the single optically thin cloud can be replaced by smaller optically thick ones .",
    "we note that the largest gmcs are of the order of 60 pc .",
    "the value of  60 pc clouds appears in contradiction to the implied size in the sfm calibration ( @xmath1510 pc ) .",
    "however , the typical cloud size can be 60 pc and still the disk opacity can change over smaller scales , if several partially overlapping clouds are seen in projection . the inverse relation between scale and density",
    "would also help make the two scales compatible .",
    "our data are consistent with optically thin clouds ( @xmath1 ) and their average opacity value implies a typical cloud size that is unresolved with _",
    "spitzer _ in our galaxies .",
    "the above fit to the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath16 indicates that , on average , more than one cloud is needed along the line - of - sight in most disks ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "however , the assumption was that @xmath23 had a single value for all the disks . in ",
    "[ ssec : tc ] , we argued that the ratio between @xmath17 and @xmath16 implied the @xmath23 is optically thin .",
    "it logically follows that optically thick disks must have more than a single cloud along the line - of - sight .",
    "figure [ fig : n_val ] illustrates the effect of number of clouds along the line - of - sight ( @xmath22 ) on the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath16 , when @xmath23 is freely increased from 0 to @xmath42 ( the lines have been drawn according to equations [ eq : tm ] and [ eq : tap ] ) .",
    "we note that all disks are consistent with many clouds along the line - of - sight including the optically thin ones , also because they lie in the optically thin cloud ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) regime .",
    "there are many refinements to be made to the simple model presented here .",
    "some improvements for future comparisons between these two measurements of optical depth are : ( 1 ) a distribution of cloud sizes for both the sfm calibration , as well as in the model explaining the ratio between sfm and sed optical depths .",
    "a model distribution can be taken from observations of gmcs in our own galaxy and nearby ones @xcite .",
    "the cross - section distribution could be used in sfm measurements in the future .",
    "a cross - section distribution can only be applied , if the foreground disk is at a single , fixed distance ; only one counts though a single foreground galaxy are used .",
    "there are three face - on spirals with enough solid angle in hst imaging as well as additional _",
    "spitzer _ data : m51 , m81 and m101 .",
    "( 2 ) the sed model can be much better constrained with additional sub - mm observations , the opportunities for which will expand dramatically in the near future ( _ scuba2 _ on the jcmt and _ herschel _ satellite ) .",
    "( 3 ) the effects of grand design spiral arms and galactic radius could be identified in a single disk ; the comparison sfm and sed is not made for different sections of the disks combined .",
    "( 4 ) a future sed model can take into account the reddening of the interstellar radiation field , as it penetrates the ism .",
    "this would require a comprehensive treatment of the ism structure in addition to its temperature , composition and irradiation .",
    "to constrain models of the spiral disk s energy budget with typical values for the size of dusty clouds in the ism , we compare two techniques to extract the average and apparent optical depths of a section of spiral disk . from the comparison between sfm and sed results ,",
    "we conclude the following :    * the sfm s calibration alone implies projected cloud scales predominantly unresolved with hst ( of the order of 10 pc in ngc 1365 , see  [ sec : csize ] and figure [ fig : sfmsize ] ) . *",
    "the dust responsible for the disk s opacity is predominantly cold ( t @xmath0 25 k , table [ table : model ] ) . * the average and apparent optical depths of these disk sections , measured from sed and sfm respectively , generally agree ( figure [ fig : fit ] and [ fig : n_val ] ) .",
    "this implies generally optically thin clouds ( @xmath45 ,  [ ssec : tc ] ) . *",
    "the fit to the ratio between apparent and average optical depth measurements , @xmath46 , indicates a cloud optical depth , @xmath23 , of 0.4 , more than a single cloud along the line - of - sight , and a cloud size of @xmath15 60 pc .",
    "if several partially overlapping clouds are seen in projection through the disk , the disk s opacity will change over smaller scales , consistent with conclusion 1 . *",
    "optically thick disks appear to have more than a single cloud along the line - of - sight ( figure [ fig : n_val ] ) and optically thin disks may have several clouds as well .",
    "future work using counts of distant galaxies through a foreground disk could be used to find cold dust structures at larger galactic radii , provided a sufficiently large solid angle has been imaged with hst / acs s superb resolution .",
    "notably , the acs data on m51 , m81 and m101 are very promising for such an analysis . _",
    "spitzer _ observations of these nearby disks are also available , making a similar comparison between sed and apparent optical depth possible for portions of these disks .",
    "the typical cloud scale for spiral arms or disk sections or as a function of galactic radius could then be found .",
    "the scuba-2 instrument has recently been installed on the james clerk maxwell telescope .",
    "a project with scuba-2 to map the sings galaxies in two sub - mm bands will improve future sed modelling of these spiral disks significantly over the sed models presented here .",
    "this work is based in part on archival data obtained with the _ spitzer _ space telescope , which is operated by jpl , caltech , under a contract with nasa .",
    "this work is also based on observations with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , obtained at the stsci , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy ( aura ) , inc .",
