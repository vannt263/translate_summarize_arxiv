    "if a time series is comprised of more than one class of event , then the peh technique can identify these distributions based on the distribution of peh data .",

    "[ algor ]    it is clear from the small gradient of the gaussian - noise peh curves that the temporal evolution of transients , originating from the tail of the distribution is slow .",
    "the striking feature of this figure is the gradient of the peh curves for the source amplitude distribution : it is much bigger than for the gaussian - noise case , because of the distance - amplitude relation .",
    "we define this type of peh data as ` geometrical ' , because it is linked to the spatial distribution of sources .",
    "we note that although we have incorporated sfr evolution and a cosmological model to calculate the dns merger rate at high @xmath28 , the peh will be most sensitive to events that are comparable to or greater than the detection threshold of the detector . for advanced ligo , this will be of order several hundred mpc ( @xmath83 ) , implying that the peh will be dominated by sources in the local universe where cosmological effects are minor .",
    "given that a geometrical signature is present in a time series , one can fit a peh model to the data , with the local rate density as a free parameter . in the presence of noise ,",
    "this signature will be modified , but if the detector noise is well characterized , a fitting function constructed from the sum of both noise and geometrical distributions can be used . for small signal - noise ratios , the noise will dominate the peh data for short observation times .",
    "but as observation time increases , the geometrical signature will grow at a faster rate than the noise .",
    "it is possible that the gw signal from dns mergers can be identified before that of a single merger , occurring above the detector threshold , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we propose that there exists an intermediate detection regime , with pre - filtered signal - noise - ratio of less than unity , where the dns merger rate is high enough that the geometrical signature could be identified in interferometer data .",
    "this type of search provides an opportunity to set upper limits on the dns merger rate .",
    "the cumulative signal from transient gw sources at cosmological distances is commonly described as a stochastic background because of the temporal randomness of the individual events .",
    "but we have shown here that , for a cosmic population of dns mergers , the gw cumulative signal will be dominated by the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the sources .",
    "we use the term ` geometrical ' noise , because the gw amplitude distribution composed of dns mergers is dominated by the spatial distribution of the sources .",
    "interestingly , geometrical noise from cosmic dns mergers ( and similar transient gw sources ) is linked to the sensitivity of the detector and the cumulative event rate .",
    "if a gw detector could probe dns mergers to distances corresponding to the time when they first occurred in the universe , the detector could potentially resolve all events and there would be no geometrical noise from unresolved signals .",
    "however , if the cumulative rate measured in our frame were to be so high that the individual chirps would overlap , corresponding to a signal of duty cycle greater than unity , then the resulting signals would manifest as geometrical noise .",
    "this is unlikely for dns mergers : the individual events are not expected to overlap but to be nonetheless not individually detectable because of the small signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we highlight the concept that the detectability of a gw stochastic background from dns mergers throughout the universe and of individual dns mergers is linked to the observer via the instrument duty cycle , the cumulative event rate and the sensitivity of the detector .",
    "the peh model is applied above to the detectability of dns mergers with advanced and initial ligo ; it shows the temporal evolution of the gw signal from many faint unresolved events converging to detectable single events of high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "detection strategies based on the peh model could utilize the geometrical signature of the temporal evolution of the chirp gw amplitude distribution .",
    "we plan to investigate the peh technique further using simulated gw background and non - gaussian noise data .",
    "the peh method could also be used to set constraints on the black hole - black hole ( bh - bh ) merger rate , which is presently highly uncertain .",
    "although occurring at a lower intrinsic rate than dns mergers , the gw emission from bh - bh mergers is expected to be significantly higher , implying an enhanced detection rate because of the larger detection volume .",
    "estimates range from 304000 yr@xmath11 assuming a bh mass of 10 m@xmath84 and a detection horizon of @xmath85 @xcite for advanced ligo sensitivity .",
    "we plan to use the bh - bh mass and merger rate distributions to determine if a peh model could be developed and applied to interferometer data to set limits on the rate and mass distributions .",
    "although we have shown how the cumulative gw signal from dns mergers should manifest in a time series , we have not yet tested how robust the above procedure is to the non - stationarity of the data .",
    "for instance , if a time series is plagued with non - gaussian transients , then the effectiveness of the fitting procedure will be reduced , unless a good model for the transients is available .",
    "we assume optimal ( matched ) filtering can be applied to the candidate transients , but the filters that will be most effective will not be exactly matched to individual events .",
    "the ` norm ' and ` mean ' filters , although not optimal , should perform at a significant fraction of a matched filter for transients where the signal is not completely characterized @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that using the peh in a signal processing context is based on fitting to outliers using a model distribution and not ` detecting ' individual events .",
    "nonetheless , it is important to filter the data to select as many transients that are candidates for dns mergers as possible . as a test of the robustness of the procedure using different filters , we plan to inject simulated cosmologically distributed gw transients into non - gaussian noise .",
    "we note that the simulated gw amplitude distribution will be modified by the detector antenna pattern , which we have not included in our simulations , where we used the mean value . in applying a peh model to real data",
    ", account must be taken of the modulation and distortion of the signal by detector characteristics and by both detector and environmental noise .",
    "we plan to extend the current simulations by incorporating such effects as part of a program to test the sensitivity of the peh fitting procedure .",

    "<S> gravitational waves generated by the final merger of double neutron star ( dns ) binary systems are a key target for the gravitational wave ( gw ) interferometric detectors , such as ligo , and the next generation detectors , advanced ligo . </S>",
    "<S> the cumulative gw signal from dns mergers in interferometric data will manifest as ` geometrical noise ' : a non - continuous stochastic background with a unique statistical signature dominated by the spatial and temporal distribution of the sources . because geometrical noise is highly non - gaussian , </S>",
    "<S> it could potentially be used to identify the presence of a stochastic gw background from dns mergers . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this by fitting to a simulated distribution of transients using a model for the dns merger rate and idealized gaussian detector noise . using the cosmological ` probability event horizon ' concept and recent bounds for the galactic dns merger rate </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the evolution of the detectability of dns mergers with observation time . for advanced ligo sensitivities and a detection threshold assuming optimal filtering , </S>",
    "<S> there is a 95% probability that a minimum of one dns merger signal will be detectable from the ensemble of events comprising the stochastic background during 12211 days of observation . for initial ligo sensitivities , </S>",
    "<S> we identify an interesting regime where there is a 95% probability that at least one dns merger with signal - to - noise ratio @xmath0 unity will occur during 468 days of observation . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that there exists an intermediate detection regime with pre - filtered signal - noise - ratio less than unity , where the dns merger rate is high enough that the geometrical signature could be identified in interferometer data .    </S>",
