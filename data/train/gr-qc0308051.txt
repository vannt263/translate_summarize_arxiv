    "neutron star and black hole binary systems are among the most probable sources of the gravitational radiation emitted in the frequency range of the earth - based interferometric detectors such as the laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo @xcite , and tama @xcite ( all will detect in the high - frequency band:@xmath0 hz to @xmath1 hz ) and the envisaged laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa)@xcite.(low - frequency band : @xmath2 hz to@xmath0 hz ) respectively . a post - newtonian ( pn ) treatment of @xmath3 pn orders is generally agreed to describe with sufficient accuracy both the motion and the gravitational radiation up to the point of the innermost circular orbit ( ico ) , at least in the case of neutron star binaries @xcite . while the 3pn order approximation is expected to locate the ico with an accuracy of 1% for binary systems with comparable masses , it breaks down in the region inner to the ico in the latest stage of the final coalescence , when numerical relativity is required .",
    "however , there is a gap between the failure of the pn expansion and the beginning of the merger , this being called the intermediate binary black hole ( ibbh ) problem @xcite , recently assessed in @xcite .",
    "the effort of providing templates for the search of the gravitational waves in the noisy background is underway , at least for binaries on circular orbits , characterized by their mass and the radius of the orbit .",
    "the assumption of circular orbits is justified by the circularizing property of the gravitational waves @xcite , still interesting situations can occur in galactic nuclei , when freshly formed binary systems have not enough time to circularize @xcite . the error produced by the neglection of the eccentricity during the search for gravitational waves",
    "was estimated to be substantial @xcite .",
    "the assumption of disregarding other characteristics of the binary components , like the spins , quadrupole moments and even magnetic dipole moments ( to be discussed in the present paper ) , in many cases is not well founded .",
    "for example there is increasing observational evidence for an overhelming majority of galactic black holes ( even colliding ones ) with maximally allowed spins @xcite . while neutron star binaries are not expected to be significantly spinning nospin1 , @xcite , neutron stars with super - strong magnetic fields ( magnetars )",
    "have also been detected @xcite .",
    "therefore a generic treatment , allowing eccentric orbits and all types of contributions up to the @xmath4pn order would be desirable in the pn - description of gravitational waves .",
    "the complexity of such results forbids their immediate implementation in templates , however with increasing computational capacity  this is hoped to become possible .",
    "an other complicating feature arising in the eccentric case is the occurence of several harmonics in the incoming gravitational wave which , contrarely to the circular case ( where the dominant frequency is twice of the orbital frequency ) will have comparable intensities @xcite . in the search for precessing binaries",
    "the use of effective templates has been proposed recently @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the eccentricity was taken into account in the second pn order description of @xcite .",
    "the 1.5 pn spin - orbit and 2pn spin - spin contributions to the orbital evolution and gravitational radiation reaction were considered in @xcite .",
    "the gravitational quadrupole - monopole type radiative contribution was also treated recently @xcite , the results matching the previous circular orbit computation @xcite .",
    "the effect of possible strong magnetic fields of the compact binary components was discussed by ioka and taniguchi @xcite , for the case of circular orbits .",
    "they argue that in the upper limit of @xmath5 @xmath6 for the magnetic fields the coupling of the magnetic dipole moments generates contributions of the same magnitude than the 2pn corrections to both the equation of motion and the gravitational radiation .",
    "they also compute the corresponding electromagnetic radiation , and find out that the electromagnetically radiated power is much less  than the power radiated away gravitationally .",
    "the ratio of the two types of radiations is @xmath7 cf .",
    "( 16 ) of @xcite , which counts approximately half of a pn order .",
    "being interested in the _ leading order radiation due to the magnetic dipoles , _ we will disregard the electromagnetic component of radiation .",
    "whether the leading order gravitational radiation due to magnetic moments truely appears at second or only at higher orders depends on the strength of the magnetic fields .",
    "actual observational evidence supports magnetic fields of @xmath8 @xmath9 for isolated magnetars @xcite .    in the present paper we would like to extend our previous computations",
    "carried on for the spin - orbit ( so ) , spin - spin ( ss ) and quadrupole - monopole ( qm ) interactions for the case of the magnetic dipole - magnetic dipole interaction .",
    "this would mean a generalization of ioka and taniguchi s description allowing for eccentric orbits .    in sect .",
    "ii we set up the formalism , by introducing the generalized true and eccentric anomaly parametrizations for the magnetic dipole - magnetic dipole perturbation .",
    "as proved earlier @xcite , all relevant integral expressions can be easily computed by use of the residue theorem , with the additional bonus that in the majority of cases the only pole is at the origin .",
    "our treatment follows closely refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the energy @xmath10 , the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum is not a conserved quantity in the absence of radiation at this order .",
    "thus we introduce its angular average @xmath11 in order to characterize the perturbed radial motion . the radial period , as well as the relation between @xmath11 and the time average @xmath12 resemble the results of the previously discussed cases .",
    "iii  contains the main results of the paper .",
    "these are the secular evolutions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 due to the magnetic dipole - magnetic dipole contribution  to the gravitational radiation  also , as in previous cases , the evolution of the angle variables @xmath13 @xmath14and @xmath15 , which characterize the relative orientation of the spin vectors and orbital angular momentum vector are derived .",
    "however the evolution of this set of variables @xmath16 does not close to a first order differential system , as in previous cases . in order to close the system",
    ", we have to compute the evolution equations for the angle variables @xmath17 characterizing the relative orientation of the spins and magnetic dipole moments .",
