    "extensions of the standard model ( sm ) by an additional abelian @xmath0 gauge group were established decades ago @xcite .",
    "recently such extensions , which arise automatically , when the sm is embedded into a more general theory such as in particular models of string theory or super symmetry @xcite , drew attention motivated by anomalies in astrophysical data @xcite .",
    "these anomalies can be explained by annihilating dark matter , where the sector of dark matter is linked to the sm sector by an @xmath0 mediator @xcite . in a minimal model",
    "the hidden sector , which contains the dark matter , does not interact directly with the sm matter , but by the exchange of a so - called hidden photon @xmath3 .",
    "the interaction between the hidden photon @xmath3 and the sm particles , which extends the sm gauge group @xmath4 , can be realized by kinetic mixing between the hidden photon gauge group @xmath5 and the sm hypercharge gauge group @xmath6 , where heavy particles charged under both gauge groups are exchanged in a loop @xcite . at low energies",
    "this gives rise to an effective interaction lagrangian @xcite of the hidden photon with the electromagnetic sm current @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the @xmath3 field and @xmath9 is the kinetic mixing factor parameterizing the coupling strength relative to the electric charge @xmath10 .",
    "the free parameters in this model are the coupling strength @xmath11 with @xmath12 and the mass of the hidden photon @xmath13 , which can be generated e.g. by the higgs mechanism .",
    "the hidden photon mass @xmath13 can be estimated to be in the range of @xmath14 to a few @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the kinetic mixing factor @xmath16 is predicted from various models to be in the range @xmath17 @xcite . in pioneering works",
    "several constraints on these parameters from existing data were obtained , e.g. data of beam dump searches or the babar experiment , as well as from @xmath18 analyses @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite a feasibility study to search for hidden photons in low energy electron scattering fixed - target experiments was performed .",
    "it was found , that the predicted coupling of the @xmath3 to sm particles and its mass range allows for the @xmath3 search by accelerator experiments at modest energies with high intensities .",
    "collider experiments are ideally suited for higher @xmath3 masses , whereas fixed - target experiments with their high luminosities are ideally suited to probe the @xmath3 hypothesis in the mev to @xmath19 gev range @xcite .",
    "several experimental programs are currently underway to search for new light , hidden gauge bosons using fixed - target experiments , e.g. the a1 experiment at the mainz microtron ( mami ) @xcite , the apex @xcite , hps @xcite and darklight @xcite experiments at the jefferson lab ( jlab ) , as well as future experiments at the mesa facility @xcite .",
    "a1 and apex have already published first results . in a variety of recent publications , constraints on the @xmath3 parameter space from the analysis of beam dump searches @xcite",
    ", meson decays and collider experiments @xcite as well as from other arguments were given @xcite .",

    "although the existing and proposed electron scattering fixed - target experiments differ in their particular setup , the physical process investigated in the experiments is always the same .",
    "the electromagnetic process of scattering an electron beam off a fixed target , which is either a proton or a heavy nucleus , induces the bremsstrahlung emission of a hidden photon as signal or a sm photon as background subsequently decaying into a pair of sm leptons .",
    "the decay particles are detected and their invariant mass is reconstructed , which allows one to search for a bump in the invariant mass spectrum caused by the hidden gauge boson .",
    "the @xmath3 will manifest itself by a very sharp peak , while the radiative background resulting from the corresponding qed process is described by a smooth distribution . to summarize",
    ", the underlying process @xmath20 is investigated with respect to an excess of events in a single bin of the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pair . by this method one",

    "furthermore , each of the investigated experiments will improve the existing current exclusion limit by at least one order of magnitude if no signal of a @xmath3 can be found .",
    "in the first part of this work we have investigated the applicability of the weizscker - williams approximation to calculate cross sections relevant for low - energy fixed target experiments searching for hidden photons .",
    "we have found , that for beam energies above @xmath56 the shape of the cross section is well reproduced within the ww approximation . for lower beam energies ,",
    "the shapes differ significantly .",
    "while from the ww approximation a steep rise of the cross section for @xmath57 is predicted , we find in our calculation , that the cross section sharply drops .",
    "this result has a great impact for the actual design of experiments , since current experiments are designed such that the cross section for the emission of a hidden photon is largest , which is in the region @xmath57 .",
    "however , the formulae for the ww approximation found in ref .  @xcite overestimate the cross section calculated in leading order of qed by @xmath58 or more , also for large beam energies .",
    "we have shown , that this is not an issue of the ww approximation itself but results from a too simplistic treatment of the hadronic current . by a more sophisticated treatment , taking the angular dependence of the momentum transfer carried by the virtual photon into account ,",
    "the calculation in leading order of qed and in the ww approximation agree within a few percent also for @xmath57 , as long as the beam energy is sufficient large . for beam energies , which are not much larger than the hidden photon mass , and @xmath57",
    ", both calculations still disagree .",
    "however , one does not expect that the ww approximation is suited to describe the cross section in this region .    in the second part of this work we have applied the methods derived in our previous work  @xcite to the kinematic settings of the darklight experiment and a setup of the type of the hps experiment , which will both be performed at jlab .",
    "for that purpose we have calculated the signal and background cross sections within the experimental limits fixed by the detector geometry .",
    "we have determined the region of parameter space which can be probed in the considered setups and have calculated the exclusion limits if no signal is seen .",
    "we have found , that both experiments , such as the experiments proposed at mainz , are ideally suited to probe the region of parameter space in which the @xmath3 can explain the @xmath51 discrepancy .",
