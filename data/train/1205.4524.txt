    "oscillations in the photon flux , and hence interference , can be recovered if the following two conditions are fulfilled : ( i ) the beam of atoms outcoupled from one well overlap spatially with the wave function of the atoms in the second trap and ( ii ) if there are either initial correlations between the atoms in the two wells or if they both possess a non - vanishing condensate fraction .    in order to better understand these conditions",
    "we first notice that the outcoupled atoms are distinguishable from the trapped atoms since they are in different quantum states .",

    "it will be proportional to the amplitude of the oscillations of the photon flux , hence , to the product of the condensate fractions of both systems .",
    "we remark , once again , that oscillations can be observed only in a single experimental run while they will disappear after performing an ensemble average .",
    "therefore , this behaviour can only be measured in systems whose properties are not deeply modified by the outcoupling of atoms .",
