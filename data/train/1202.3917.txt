    "in the second part of xx century the new results concerning to representation theory in linear spaces were obtained , in particular , the results about relative position of several subspaces and partially ordered collections of subspaces in linear spaces ( see , for example , @xcite ) . representations of partially ordered sets ( _ posets _ in sequel ) were first introduced by l.nazarova and a.roiter ( see @xcite ) , using the language of `` matrix problems '' , as a tool to prove the second brauer - thrall conjecture .",
    "later p.gabriel gave an equivalent ( up to a finite number of indecomposables ) definition of representations using `` subspace '' language ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) ) . in the sequel we use the latter terminology .",
    "one can try to develop a similar theory for unitary spaces .",
    "namely , one can transfer straightforward the definitions from linear to unitary case keeping in mind that the morphisms between two representations should preserve their unitary structure ; that is , the morphisms are unitary maps . with this restriction",
    "the classification problem becomes extremely difficult already in very simple situations .",
    "for example the problem of classifying unitary representations of the poset @xmath0 is hopeless , since by @xcite it contains the problem of classifying any system of operators in unitary spaces ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) for more details ) .",
    "the idea , hence , is to consider those representations which satisfy some additional conditions .",
    "in such a way there were defined orthoscalar representations of quivers ( see @xcite ) and orthoscalar representations of posets ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "certainly the additional conditions can be chosen differently .",
    "orthoscalarity relation appears in different areas of mathematics .",
    "for example , using @xcite , one can show that every indecomposable orthoscalar representation of a poset generates a stable reflexible sheaf on certain toric variety .",
    "this is one of the motivation to study such representations .    analyzing the results related to orthoscalar representations of quivers and posets ( see @xcite and references therein ) one can see the mysterious ( on the first sight ) connection with the classical results ( more details in section 1 ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to explain this phenomena .    for a given finite poset @xmath1",
    "we consider the variety @xmath2 of all representations of @xmath1 with dimension vector @xmath3 .",
    "we show that the classes of unitary non - equivalent orthoscalar representations of @xmath1 with dimension vector @xmath4 can be viewed as the symplectic quotient of @xmath5 . on the other side we consider the git quotient of @xmath5 with respect to some polarization of this variety .",
    "this quotient can be viewed as the set of isomorphism classes of polystable linear representations of @xmath1 with dimension @xmath4 .",
    "we show that the identification between these two quotients is a consequence of the fundamental kirwan - ness theorem ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "let us mention that the idea of the symplectic reduction in similar contexts is not new .",
    "for example , it appeared in @xcite ( constructing moduli spaces for quivers ) and in @xcite ( in connection with horn s problem ) . in this text",
    "we apply it in the setting of partially ordered sets .",
    "in section [ s_pre ] we recall basic facts about the posets and their indecomposable representations in linear spaces and indecomposable orthoscalar representations in unitary spaces , in particular we compare some known results about the structure of representations in both cases . in section  [ s_symplect ]",
    "we give some basic facts about symplectic quotients .",
    "section  [ s_git ] is dedicated to the git quotients .",
    "we explain the construction and state the kirwan - ness theorem which connects symplectic and git quotients . in section  [ s_corr ]",
    "we prove theorem  [ poscor ] which relates representations of posets in linear spaces with the ones in unitary spaces with orthoscalar condition . in section  [ s_dimension ]",
    "we estimate the dimension of the variety of uni - classes of representations of a given poset with a given dimension vector using the connection between posets and bound quivers .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite poset with partial order relation @xmath6 . denote by @xmath7 the extension of @xmath1 by a unique maximal element @xmath8 . to @xmath1",
    "we associate the hasse quiver of @xmath7 which is denoted by @xmath9 . the _ order _ of @xmath1 is the number of its elements .",
    "a poset is said to be _ primitive _ and denoted by @xmath10 if it is a disjoint ( cardinal ) sum of linearly ordered sets with the orders @xmath11 .",
    "a poset @xmath1 is primitive if and only if the corresponding quiver @xmath12 has a star - shaped form .",
    "let @xmath13 be the poset consisting of three elements @xmath14 with a unique relation @xmath15 .",
