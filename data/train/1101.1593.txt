    "the origin of high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hf qpos ) observed in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) is one of challenging subjects to be examined , since its examination will clarify the structure of the innermost part of relativistic accretion disks and the spin of central sources .",
    "one promising possibility is that the qpos are disk oscillations excited in the innermost region of relativistic disks .",
    "particularly , the idea that hf qpos are disk oscillations resonantly excited in deformed ( warped or eccentric ) disks has been suggested by kato ( 2004 , 2008a , b ) by analysical considerations , and studied by ferreria and ogilvie ( 2008 ) and oktariani et al .",
    "( 2010 ) by numerical calculations . in this model ,",
    "a disk oscillation ( hereafter , original oscillation ) interacts non - linearly with the disk deformation to produce an oscillation ( hereafter , intermediate oscillation ) .",
    "the intermediate oscillation is a forced oscillation due to the coupling between the original oscillation and the deformation .",
    "the intermediate oscillation then resonantly responds to the forcing term at a certain radius ( lindblad resonance ) . after having the resonance ,",
    "the intermediate oscillation interacts non - linearly again with the disk deformation to feed back to the original oscillation . through this feedback process",
    "the original and intermediate oscillations are excited , if cetain conditions are satisfied .",
    "some important consequences have been obtained so far in relation to the origin of the instability : i ) the wave energies of the original and intermediate oscillations must have opposite signs ( kato 2004 , 2008a ) .",
    "that is , the instability is a result of wave energy exchange between two oscillations with opposite signs of energy through a disk deformation .",
    "ii ) since the intermediate oscillation resonantly responds to forcing terms resulting from the coupling between the disk deformation and the original oscillation , its amplitude is not necessarily small compared with that of the original oscillation ( see figure 3 of oktariani et al .",
    "this means that the terminology of `` original '' and `` intermediate '' oscillations has no particular meaning .",
    "the two oscillations are equal partners , i.e. , the role of the original oscillation mentioned in the previous paragraph can be also performed by the intermediate oscillation .",
    "hence , the interaction between two oscillations can be schematically sketched as figure 1 .",
    "this has been correctly acknowleged by ferreira and ogilvie ( 2008 ) ( see figure 3 of their paper ) .",
    "based on the above considerations , we develop here a perspective analytical method to study the instability . in the previous analytical studies",
    ", we considered only the cases where the disk deformation is time - independent ( i.e. , its frequency of the disk deformation , @xmath0 , is zero ) and frequencies of the two oscillations , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , coupling through disk deformation are the same , i.e. , @xmath3 . in the present analyses ,",
    "the resonant condition is extended to @xmath4 with non - zero @xmath0 and effects of weak deviation from the resonant condition , @xmath5 , on growth rate of oscillations are also examined .",
    "it is noted that the number of oscillations contributing to this resonant process is not always limited to two . in order to understand the essence of this instability , however , we assume in this paper that only two modes of oscillations contribute to this resonsnt process .",
    "more general cases will be a subject in the future .",
    "we summarize here basic equations and relations [ see kato ( 2008a , b ) for details ] to be used to discuss wave couplings through a disk deformation .      when we try to quantitatively",
    "apply the present excitation process to high - frequency qpos observed in gbhcs ( galactic black hole candidates ) and lmxbs , effects of general relativity should be taken into account .",
    "the general relativity is , however , not essential to understanding the essence of the instability mechanism .",
    "hence , in this paper , for simplicity , formulation is done in the framework of a pseudo - newtonian potential , using the gravitational potential introduced by paczy ' nski and wiita ( 1980 ) .",
    "we adopt a lagrangian formulation by lynden - bell and ostriker ( 1967 ) .",
    "the unperturbed disk is in a steady equilibrium state . over the equilibrium state",
    ", weakly nonlinear perturbations are superposed . by using a displacement vector , @xmath6 , the weakly nonlinear hydrodynamical equation describing adiabatic , nonself - gravitating perturbations",
    "is written as , after lengthly manipulation ( lynden - bell and ostriker 1967 ) , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a linear hermitian operator with respect to @xmath6 and is @xmath9                             \\nonumber \\\\",

    "since the self - gravity of the disk gas has been neglected , the gravitational potential , @xmath16 , is a given function and has no eulerian perturbation . in the above hydrodynamical equations ( [ 2.3 ] ) and",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) , there is no restriction on the form of unperturbed flow @xmath17 .",
    "however , in the followings we assume that the unperturbed flow is a cylindrical rotation alone , i.e. , @xmath18 , in the cylindrical cordinates ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , where the origin is at the disk center and the @xmath21-axis is in the direction perpendicular to the unperturbed disk plane with @xmath22 being the angular velocity of disk rotation .",
    "the right - hand side of wave equation ( [ 2.3 ] ) represents the weakly nonlinear terms .",
    "no detailed expression for @xmath23 is given here ( for detailed expressions , see kato 2004 , 2008a ) , but an important characteristics of @xmath23 is that we have commutative relations ( kato 2008a ) for an arbitrary set of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , e.g. , @xmath27 as shown later , the presence of these commutative relations leads to a simple expression of instability criterion .",
    "we suppose that the presence of these commutative relations is a general property of conservative systems beyond the assumption of weak nonlinearity .      in preparation for subsequent studies ,",
    "some orthogonality relations are summarized here .",
    "eigen - functions describing linear oscillations in non - deformed disks are denoted by @xmath28 . here , the subscript @xmath29 is used to distinct all eigen - functions .",
    "time - dependent part of @xmath28 is expressed as exp@xmath30 , where @xmath31 is real .",
    "then , @xmath28 satisfies @xmath32 now , this equation is multiplied by @xmath33 and integrated over the whole volume , where the superscript * denotes the complex conjugate and @xmath34 .",
    "the volume integration of @xmath35 over the whole volume is written hereafter as @xmath36 .",
    "then , we have @xmath37 similarly , integrating the linear wave equation of @xmath38 over the whole volume after the equation being multiplied by @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 since the operator @xmath41 is a hermitian ( lynden - bel and ostriker 1967 ) , we have the relation of @xmath42^*\\cdot        \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\xi$}_\\beta^*\\rangle     = \\langle\\mbox{\\boldmath $ l$}(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\xi$}_\\alpha)\\cdot                           \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\xi$}_\\beta^*\\rangle .",
    "\\label{2.8}\\ ] ] hence , the difference of the above two equations [ eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) ] gives , when @xmath43 , @xmath44 in deriving the last equality , we have used an integration by part , assuming that @xmath45 vanishes on the disk surface .",
    "different from the case of non - rotating stars , the eigenfunctions of normal modes of disk oscillations are not orthogonal in the sense of @xmath46 . in spite of this , however , eigenfunctions of disk oscillations are orthogonal in many situations .",
    "they are classified by azimuthal wavenumber , @xmath47 , node number in the vertical direction , @xmath48 , and that in the radial direction , @xmath49 , in addition to the distinction of p- and g - modes [ see kato ( 2001 ) or kato et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for classification of disk oscillations ] .",
    "eigenfunctions with different azimuthal wavenumber are obviously orthogonal , i.e. , @xmath50 when @xmath51 .",
    "even if the azimuthal wavenumbers are the same , @xmath52 when @xmath53 , if the disk is geometrically thin and isothermal in the vertical direction .",
    "this comes from the fact that in such disks the @xmath21-dependence of eigen - functions with @xmath48 node(s ) in the @xmath21-direction ( @xmath48 is zero or a positive integer ) is described by the hermite polynomials @xmath54 as @xmath55 ( okazaki et al .",
    "1987 ) , where the subscripts @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 represent the cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) whose origin is at the disk center and the @xmath21-axis is perpendicular to the disk plane . here",
    ", @xmath54 is the hermite polynomial of argument @xmath56 , @xmath57 being the half - thickness of the disk .",
    "thus , the eigen - functions classified by @xmath47 and @xmath48 are orthogonal . in summary",
    ", we have @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the kronecker delta , i.e. , it is unity when @xmath60 , while zero when @xmath61 .",
    "orthogonality of @xmath62 does not hold in the case where @xmath63 and @xmath64 . even in these cases , however , @xmath62 will be close to zero for @xmath65 , if our interest is on short wavelength oscillations in the radial direction , since the radial dependence of eigenfunctions is close to sinusoidal in such cases .",
    "let us consider the case where two oscillation modes , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , resonantly couple through disk deformation @xmath68 . through the coupling term @xmath69",
    "[ see eq.([2.3 ] ) ] many other modes than @xmath70 and @xmath71 appear , and their amplitudes as well as those of @xmath70 and @xmath71 become time dependent .",
    "now , we assume that normal modes of oscillations form a complete set , and expand the resulting oscillations , @xmath72 , including the disk deformation , @xmath68 , in the form @xmath73 since our main concern is on the modes 1 and 2 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are distinguished from other eigen - functions and the subscript @xmath29 is hereafter used only to denote other eigenfunctions than @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "our purpose here is to derive equations describing a secular time evolution of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the disk deformation @xmath68 is assumed to have a much larger amplitude than other oscillations and its time variation during the coupling processes is neglected , i.e. , @xmath76 const .",

    "here , we take all @xmath100 to be zero or positive intergers , while @xmath101 is not always positive . if @xmath102 , the oscillation is retrograde .",
    "it is noted here that by using equation ( [ 3.41 ] ) , we can express the wave energy of the normal mode oscillation in an instructive form . since the @xmath19- and @xmath20- components of @xmath70 , say @xmath103 and @xmath104 , are related in a geometrically thin disks by ( e.g. , kato 2004 ) @xmath105 we have @xmath106 this shows that the sign of wave energy is determined by the sign of @xmath107 in the region where the wave exists predominantly ( e.g. , kato 2001 ) .",
    "for example , a prograde ( @xmath108 ) wave inside the corotation resonance has a negativce energy , while a prograde wave outside it has a positive energy .    in previous papers we mainly considered the case of @xmath3 with @xmath109 .",
    "in this paper , we extend our analyses to more general cases of resonance : @xmath110 where @xmath0 is not necessary to be small .",
    "we introduce @xmath111 and @xmath112 defined by @xmath113 in the resonance of @xmath114 , @xmath111 is small , but @xmath112 is not small unless @xmath0 is small . in the resonance of @xmath115 , on the other hand , @xmath112 is small , but @xmath111 is not always so unless @xmath0 is small .",
    "it is noted that the resonant condition concerning azimuthal wavenumber is @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are zero or positive integers , while @xmath119 is a positive integer , since we focus our attention only on the case where the disk deformation is non - axisymmetric , i.e. , @xmath120 .",
    "after these preparations , we integrate equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) over the whole volume after multiplying @xmath121 .",

    "concerning the term with @xmath126 , some more consideration is necessary .",
    "if @xmath127 , by using equation ( [ 2.9 ] ) we can reduce the integration to @xmath128 in the case where @xmath129 , @xmath130 vanishes since @xmath120 . on the other hand , when @xmath131 , @xmath132 does not appear in the coupling term",
    "that is , @xmath74 and @xmath132 have no nonlinear couplings and thus we can take as @xmath133 when we consider time evolution of @xmath74 . in the case of @xmath134 , the last term on the left - hand side of equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) does not lead to equation ( [ * ] ) . even in this case , by the same arguments as the above we can neglect the term . considering these situations we have @xmath135    among various coupling terms on the right - hand side of equation ( [ 3.5 ] ) , the first two terms with @xmath136 and @xmath137 can be neglected if we consider non - axisymmetric disk deformations such as warp or eccentric deformation , since the terms inside @xmath138 in equations ( [ w11 ] ) and ( [ w11 ] ) are proportional to @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively , and their angular averages vanish .",
    "the last two terms with @xmath141 and @xmath142 on the right - hand side of equation ( [ 3.5 ] ) are also neglected hereafter by the following reasons .",
    "the terms inside of @xmath138 of equations ( [ w1alpha ] ) and ( [ w1alpha ] ) are proportional to @xmath143 $ ] and @xmath144 $ ] , respectively . in general",
    ", they rapidly vary with time , since no resonant condition is assumed among @xmath1 , @xmath31 , and @xmath0 . hence ,",
    "if short timescale variations are averaged over , s vary slowly with time ] the averaged quantities are small and can be neglected.s is / are close to @xmath145 . for example , all trapped axi - symmetric g - mode oscillations have frequencies close to @xmath146 ( the maximum of the epicyclic frequency ) , when their azimuthal wavenumber is zero .",
    "then , @xmath141 or @xmath142 have no rapid time variation and can not be neglected by the above argument of time average when @xmath147 satisfies the relation of @xmath129 .",
    "then , the terms with @xmath141 or @xmath142 also contribute to resonant couplings .",
    "such cases are outside of our present concern .",
    "see related discussions in the final section . ] in summary , the coupling terms remained are the middle two terms of equation ( [ 3.5 ] ) with @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "based on the above preparations , we reduce equation ( [ 3.5 ] ) to @xmath150 where the symbol @xmath59 means that it is unity when @xmath60 , but zero when @xmath61 .",
    "here , from @xmath148 and @xmath149 the time and azimuthally dependent parts are separated as @xmath151 @xmath152 a physical meaning of equation ( [ 3.10 ] ) is as follows .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath153 , for example , is the rate of work done on mode 1 ( when mode 2 and the deformation have unit amplitudes ) through the coupling of @xmath154 ( kato 2008a ) .",
    "hence , in a rough sense , equation ( [ 3.10 ] ) represents the fact that the growth rate of mode 1 is given by energy flux @xmath155 $ ] to mode 1 as @xmath156    the next subject is to derive an equation describing the time evolution of @xmath75 by a similar procedure as the above .",
    "that is , equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) is multiplied by @xmath157 and integrated over the whole volume .",
    "then , as the equation corresponding to equation([3.5 ] ) , we have @xmath158 here , not all of the expressions for @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 are given , since they are the same as those of @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath141 , and @xmath165 , respectively , except that @xmath166 in the latters are replaced now by @xmath157 .",
    "as examples , we give only @xmath159 and @xmath160 as @xmath167 @xmath168    by the same argument used in reducing equation ( [ 3.5 ] ) to equation ( [ 3.10 ] ) , we simplify equation ( [ 3.11 ] ) .",

    "these relation come from the fact that for arbitrary functions , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , their order in @xmath176 can be arbitrary changed [ see equation ( [ commutative ] ) ] ( kato 2008a ) .",
    "by solving the set of equations ( [ 3.10 ] ) and ( [ 3.12 ] ) , we examine how amplitudes of @xmath74 and @xmath75 evolve with time .",

    "if @xmath193 increases beyond a certain limit the left - hand side of inequality ( [ 4.7 ] ) becomes positive , and @xmath186 is no longer complex .",

    "two oscillations certianly grow again at the limit of exact resonance of @xmath200 ( i.e. , @xmath201 ) , if @xmath190 .",
    "even if the resonance is not exact , they grow if @xmath202 is small enough so that @xmath203 is satisfied .      finally , it is useful to derive an instructive relation between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "let us first consider the case of @xmath177 .",
    "let us multiply @xmath204 to equation ( [ 4.1 ] ) and also @xmath74 to the complex conjugate of equation ( [ 4.1 ] ) . then , summing these two equations we have an equation describing time evolution of @xmath205 .",
    "similarly , from equation ( [ 4.2 ] ) , we can derive an equation describing time evolution of @xmath206 .",

    "the results in the previous subsections show that when resonant conditions of @xmath212 and @xmath213 are satisfied among two oscillations characterized by ( @xmath1 , @xmath117 ) and ( @xmath2 , @xmath118 ) and disk deformation characterized by ( @xmath0 , @xmath119 ) , the two oscillations are resonantly excited if @xmath190 is realized . a deviation from the condition of @xmath212 decreases the growth rate , but oscillations grow as long as the deviation is smaller than a critical value .    in the case where both of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are positive ( i.e.",
    ", both oscillations are prograde ) , the above instability condition is @xmath214 .",
    "this is the result suggested by kato ( 2004 , 2008a , b ) by a different approach .    in the case where @xmath0 is larger than @xmath215 , a resonant condition , @xmath191 ,",

    "it is noted that in the case where both of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are negative , both @xmath87 and @xmath89 are positive , so that the condition of resonant instability , @xmath190 , can not be satisfied .    among three case of i ) @xmath108 and @xmath221 , ii ) @xmath216 and @xmath221 , and iii ) @xmath216 and @xmath222 , the interesting case in the practical sense is the first one , which is discussed in the next section .",

    "they considered the resonant interaction , through a standing warp ( @xmath109 ) , between i ) the axisymmetric g - mode oscillation whose @xmath223 has one node in the vertical direction and ii ) the one - armed p - mode oscillation whose @xmath223 has no node in the vertical direction . that is , the set of ( @xmath224 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) is ( @xmath225 , 0 , 1 ) for the g - mode oscillation , and ( @xmath225 , 1 , 0 ) for the p - mode one , where @xmath146 is the maximum of the ( radial ) epicyclic frequency .",
    "the warp is taken to be ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) . in this case , the resonant conditions , @xmath226 ( i.e. , @xmath109 ) and @xmath177 , are satisfied . hence , if @xmath214 , these modes are excited simultaneously .",
    "this condition of @xmath214 is really satisfied , since the axisymmetric g - mode oscillation has a positive energy , while the p - mode oscillation trapped between the inner edge of the disk and the barrier resulting from the boundary between the propagation and evanescent regions has a negative energy .",
    "the cause of excitation is a positive energy flow from a negative energy oscillation ( p - mode ) to a positive energy oscillation ( g - mode ) . by this energy flow",
    "both oscillations grow .",
    "the disk deformation is a catalyzer of this energy flow .    in the above argument the disk deformation",
    "is assumed to be a warp . instead of a warp , we can consider a c - mode oscillation as one of other possible disk deformations . in this case",
    "the set of ( @xmath224 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) of the disk deformation is ( @xmath0 , 1 , 1 ) , where @xmath0 is the frequency of c - mode oscillation and @xmath227 , unless the spin of the central source is high ( silbergleit et al .",
    "the resonant condition in this case is @xmath212 , not @xmath3 .",
    "there are some limitations of a direct comparison of the present analytical results to the numerical ones by ferreira and ogilvie ( 2008 ) . in the present analyses",
    "only two normal modes of oscillations are assumed to contribute to the resonance to understand the essence of the resonant instability . in the realistic case considered numerically by ferreira and ogilvie ( 2008 )",
    ", however , more than two normal modes of oscillations may contribute to the resonance . in their case one of resonant oscillations",
    "is an axisymmetric g - mode . as mentioned in footnote 4 , eigen - frequencies of the axisymmetric ( @xmath228 ) g - mode oscillations with different @xmath49 ( with @xmath229 ) are all close to @xmath146 .",
    "hence , the g - mode oscillations that satisfy the resonant conditions , @xmath201 and @xmath230 , may not be only one , and overtones of g - mode oscillations with nodes in the radial direction may also contribute partially to the resonance .",
    "if this is the case , some coupling terms with other @xmath85 than @xmath74 and @xmath75 appear in equations describing time evolution of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in the present analytical formulation",
    "such situations are not considered . to extend our analyses to such cases",
    ", we must derive equations describing the time evolution of other @xmath85 s than @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and these equations should be solved simultaneously with the equations describing time evolution of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we think that the essence of the instability mechanism is already presented in the case where couplings occur only between two oscillations .",
    "however , since such extention of our formulation is formally simple and there may be some subsidiary modifications of instability criterion , such extension should be done in the near future .    in the present formulation ,",
    "some important theoretical problems remain to be clarified .",
    "one of them is whether the set of normal modes of oscillations form a complete set .",
    "if not , it is uncertain whether the oscillations realized on the disk can be expressed in the form of equation ( [ 3.1 ] ) .    in the case where @xmath0 is larger than @xmath2 , the resonant frequency @xmath1 which satisfies the condition , @xmath191 , is negative . in this case of @xmath216 , @xmath87 is positive [ see equation ( [ energy ] ) ] .",
    "hence , the instability condition in this case is @xmath220 , as mentioned in the last section .",
    "all the g - mode and p - mode oscillations with negative frequency are , however , not trapped in the inner region of disks .",
    "they propagate away far outside unless the disks are truncated , . ]",
    "that is , their frequencies are continuous and will not be directly related to the qpo phenomena in disks .",
    "it is important to note here that the innermost region of relativistic disks is a place where the present excitation mechanism works most efficiently . for the mechanism to work",
    ", two normal modes of oscillations with opposite signs of wave energy must coexist in a common region of disks .",
    "in general , for @xmath231 , positive energy oscillations propagate in the region outside the radius of corotation resonance , while negative energy oscillations inside the resonance .",
    "hence , there is a tendency that the propagation region of oscillations with opposite signs of wave energy are spatially separated , unless different types of oscillation modes are considered .",
    "if the propagation region of oscillations with opposite signs of wave energy are separated , the coupling efficiency between the two oscillations are weak , i.e. , @xmath232 s in equations ( [ 3.10 ] ) and ( [ 3.12 ] ) are small , and practically there is no growth of oscillations . for oscillations with opposite signs of wave energy to coexist in a common region , effects of general relativity is important .",
    "it is noted that in such cases there is a tendency that the lindblad resonance of an oscillation ( e.g. , p - mode ) occurs in the propagation region of the other oscillation ( e.g. , g - mode ) .",
    "this helps to increase the growth rate since the coupling terms become large , as mentioned before .    finally , as an application of the present resonant excitation process of oscillations , we briefly note kato s model of high - frequency twin qpos ( e.g. , kato and fukue 2006 ) . in this model",
    "the lower - frequency qpo of the twin is related to the set of g - mode and p - mode oscillations considered numerically by ferreira and ogilvie ( 2008 ) and oktariani et al .",
    "the higher - frequency qpo of the twin is considered to be the set of one - armed g - mode and two - armed p - mode oscillations [ see for details figures 1 to 3 of kato ( 2008a ) ] . here",
    ", the g - mode oscillation has a positive energy and the p - mode one has a negative energy , and thus this set of oscillations can also grow by the resonant coupling .    in his model ,",
    "correlated time variation of twin qpos observed in neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries are described by assuming time variation of @xmath0 .",
    "one of problems of this model , however , is that masses of neutron stars required to take into account observations are rather high , i.e. , for example , 2.4 @xmath233 for sco x-1 and 4u 1636 - 53 .",
    "see lin et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for detailed comparison of various qpo models with observations . in black - hole low - mass x - ray binaries ,",
    "the twin qpos have no frequency change with frequency ratio of 3 : 2 . in kato s model",
    "this can be described by assuming @xmath109 .",
    "the spin parameters @xmath234 s estimated by this model for black hole sources with measured masses are around @xmath235 ( e.g. , kato and fukue 2006 ) .",
    "however , the spin parameters estimated by comparing model continuum x - ray spectra with observations are generally higher than the above , say around @xmath236 or more ( e.g. , narayan et at ."
