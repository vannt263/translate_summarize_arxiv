    "this paper continues the line of investigation started in our previous work ( rafikov 2001 , 2002a ; hereafter papers i and ii ) which was devoted to the treatment of planetesimal - planetesimal gravitational interactions . here",
    "we consider the interaction between the growing protoplanetary embryo and the planetesimal disk . by embryo",
    "we imply in the present context a single body with mass @xmath0 much larger than the masses of individual planetesimals @xmath1 .",
    "there are several reasons for studying this important problem separately from the mutual gravitational scattering of planetesimals .",
    "first , planetesimal - planetesimal encounters in realistic protoplanetary disks usually occur in the dispersion - dominated regime , which applies when the relative approach velocity of two particles is bigger than the differential shear in the disk across the hill ( or tidal ) radius .",
    "the hill radius is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a value of the semimajor axis at which the interaction takes place , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the masses of interacting planetesimals and of the central star .",
    "however , in the same protoplanetary disk gravitational interaction between the embryo and planetesimals could be in the opposite velocity regime  shear - dominated  when the planetesimal random motion is small compared to the shear across the hill radius , simply because the embryo mass and therefore the hill radius is much larger .",
    "indeed , in the case of embryo - planetesimal interactions hill radius @xmath6 ( here @xmath7 is a semimajor axis of the embryo ) as a consequence of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , reduced ( normalized in hill coordinates ) values of random velocities in the embryo - planetesimal case are smaller by a factor @xmath9^{1/3}\\ll 1 $ ] than those corresponding to the planetesimal - planetesimal interactions .    of course",
    ", it might be that the planetesimal disk has already been so excited dynamically that even embryo - planetesimal encounters are in the dispersion - dominated regime .",
    "thus , we consider here both regimes of the embryo - planetesimal interaction  shear- and dispersion - dominated .",
    "second , embryo - planetesimal interactions are complicated by the presence of a special type of orbits in a @xmath10-body problem  the so - called horseshoe ( or librating ) orbits ( hnon & petit 1986 ; murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "planetesimals on these orbits do not perform the usual circulating motion which is characteristic of passing orbits ( the most important case for planetesimal - planetesimal scattering ) but a librating one .",
    "this horseshoe motion can only occur when the difference in semimajor axes of interacting bodies is smaller than their hill radius . for planetesimal - planetesimal interactions",
    "@xmath11 is negligible compared to the scale of surface density variations or the radial epicyclic excursion of an individual planetesimal .",
    "thus horseshoe orbits are unimportant in this case",
    ". however , the hill radius of the embryo - planetesimal interaction @xmath12 can be comparable to the length scale of the disk inhomogeneities caused by the embryo .",
    "thus the phenomenon of horseshoe motion can be crucial for the planetesimal dynamics near the embryo ( see below  [ subsubsect : hs_separation ] ) .",
    "third , as we have already mentioned in paper ii , planetesimal - planetesimal scattering is described in terms of the disk properties _ averaged _ over some region of the disk , which diminishes the importance of the details of spatial distributions of disk properties . on the contrary , in the case of the embryo - planetesimal interaction we are interested in details of the _ spatial behavior _ of various quantities characterizing the state of the disk and they are the primary goal of our present study .",
    "all these complications preclude the direct application of the results obtained in paper ii to the present consideration .",
    "however the general analytical approach to the treatment of planetesimal disk evolution developed there remains valid and we will employ it in this paper .    numerical orbit integrations ( tanaka & ida 1996 , 1997 ) and n - body simulations ( ida & makino 1993 ) provide an alternative and important route of studying embryo - planetesimal interactions .",
    "their drawback is their intrinsically low speed and inability to treat large number of planetesimals .",
    "however , since the physics is incorporated in them on a very basic level with the minimum of additional assumptions they can provide us with robust predictions . to use this advantage of numerical methods and to avoid their handicaps we employ the following methodology : we provide a self - consistent _ analytical _ description of the embryo - planetesimal interaction in different velocity regimes . to check this description and to verify the validity of the simplifying assumptions utilized in its development we have used numerical orbit integrations performed for several sets of typical planetesimal disk parameters .",
    "after we make sure that our theory works well for these sets of parameters we can use it for others as well and be confident of its reliability .",
    "what we gain by this approach is the speed of computation and ability to explore the whole space of important physical variables .",
    "the condition on the embryo s mass , @xmath13 , has important dynamical implications . in many applications",
    "it justifies the neglect of the embryo s recoil resulting from planetesimal scattering .",
    "also , dynamical friction between the embryo and planetesimals will tend to produce random energy equipartition ( stewart & wetherill 1988 ; wetherill & stewart 1989 ) which means that embryo s eccentricity and inclination are most likely to be negligibly small .",
    "thus , we will assume in this paper that the embryo moves on a fixed circular orbit and its eccentricity and inclination are zero .",
    "we will also consider the embryo to be isolated from the gravitational effects of other massive bodies which may be growing nearby , an assumption which can easily be abandoned in future work . throughout the paper",
    "we neglect the presence of any resonant effects .",
    "this is justifiable if frequent planetesimal - planetesimal encounters can destroy any commensurabilities with the embryo s rotation period .",
    "the embryo s recoil in the course of planetesimal scattering and distant embryo - embryo interactions would also help to do that .",
    "we leave for the future the clarification of conditions necessary for employing this simplification",
    ".    it will be convenient to use the embryo s hill radius @xmath12 as a unit of length in our study .",
    "we introduce the hill orbital elements of a planetesimal evaluated at large azimuthal distance from the embryo  the difference in semimajor axes @xmath14 , eccentricity @xmath15 , and inclination @xmath16 relative to the embryo s orbit at semimajor axis @xmath7 : @xmath17 and use them as planetesimal coordinates . the distribution function of the orbital elements @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 will be assumed to have a rayleigh form with dispersions @xmath18 and @xmath19 : @xmath20 .",
    "\\label{eq : railey}\\ ] ] we will also be using the dimensionless surface number density of guiding centers @xmath21 to characterize the planetesimal spatial distribution .",
    "although we focus on a single embryo , for many applications we can treat the embryo using a continuous form of the evolution equations .",
    "fro example , we may assume that the discrete surface number density of the embryo is given by @xmath22 since planetesimal - planetesimal interactions are not important here it will be enough to consider a single - mass planetesimal population .",
    "the three - body interaction in the hill approximation preserves a certain combination of relative orbital elements of interacting bodies called the jacobi constant ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; hnon & petit 1986 ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the gravitational potential of the embryo , which can be neglected far from the embryo . for",
    "embryo - planetesimal scattering one can introduce the concept of integrated jacobi constant of the whole planetesimal population : @xmath25dh .",
    "\\label{eq : int_jacobi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this quantity should be conserved because ( 1 ) each individual planetesimal scattering off the embryo conserves the jacobi constant of the relative motion , and ( 2 ) embryo s random motion is negligible , which means that relative eccentricity , inclination , and difference in semimajor axes are determined by planetesimal orbital parameters only .",
    "we will use the conservation of this quantity and of the total number of planetesimals ( we neglect their coagulation at this point ) @xmath26 as checks of our evolution equations .",
    "the orbit integrations that we use are performed by solving hill equations numerically .",
    "we have integrated the evolution of the system [ equations of osculating orbital elements evolution ( 11 ) of paper ii ] using fourth order runge - kutta integrator ( press 1988 ) .",
    "unlike similar calculations of tanaka & ida ( 1996 , 1997 ) our orbit integrations do not employ additional analytical simplifications to avoid possible biases . in a typical integration",
    "the jacobi constant is conserved with fractional accuracy @xmath27 .",
    "the results of these orbit integrations and their comparisons with theoretical predictions will be presented in the following sections .",
    "we devote  [ subsect : em_shear ] to studying the shear - dominated case and  [ subsect : em_dispersion ] to exploring the dispersion - dominated case .",
    "the velocity regime intermediate between them is addressed in appendix [ app : intermediate_velocity ] .",
    "we discuss some general features of the embryo - planetesimal interaction in ",
    "[ sect : repulsion ] .",
    "some auxiliary results are presented in appendices : appendix [ app : scat_erobab ] contains the derivation of the probability distribution of scattered semimajor axes in the dispersion - dominated regime , while in appendix [ app : accr_rate ] we calculate the embryo s accretion rate in different velocity regimes .",
    "we consider first the embryo - planetesimal interaction in the shear - dominated regime . in paper",
    "ii we have derived a master equation ( 30 ) for the evolution of the planetesimal distribution function .",
    "we will use this general equation and equation ( 33 ) of paper ii as a basis for our further developments .",
    "the conditions for the shear - dominated regime to be realized are @xmath28 some important simplifications can then be made .",
    "first , scattering in this regime is deterministic in the sense that the outcome of an interaction between two particles depends only on their difference in semimajor axes before the collision @xmath29 and not on their relative random motion ( which is naturally absent in this case ) .",
    "this means that the change of the reduced semimajor axis difference @xmath30 to parallel the discussion of paper ii . ]",
    "is a single - valued function of only @xmath29 in this regime .",
    "second , inclination is hardly excited at all in the course of an encounter .",
    "a considerable change of inclination requires a substantial force acting in the vertical direction .",
    "however , the dynamically cold disk is very thin and it is easy to see that the gravitational force between the interacting particles is directed almost horizontally .",
    "thus , noticeable inclination growth can occur only for particles experiencing very close encounters . from qualitative considerations",
    "one would expect that change of the inclination vector @xmath31 ( see petit & hnon 1986 ; ida 1990 ; paper ii ) is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the initial value of the reduced vector inclination and @xmath34 is some function which can be easily computed numerically . for our purposes we neglect the inclination growth due to the gravitational stirring in the shear - dominated regime completely and set @xmath35 .",
    "we will however keep the terms describing the transport of vertical energy in the disk ( see below ) .",
    "the absence of heating in the vertical direction naturally leads to another simplification . since we can neglect the change of inclination in the encounter the change of eccentricity becomes directly related to the change of semimajor axis difference due to the conservation of jacobi constant ( [ eq : jacobi ] ) .",
    "then we can write that the change of the vector eccentricity @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "\\label{eq : de_cold}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath38 if @xmath39 .",
    "it can also be easily shown that @xmath40 in the shear - dominated regime ; the corresponding scattering coefficients in evolution equations will therefore be neglected in this paper .",
    "thus , the probability @xmath41 of scattering from @xmath42 to @xmath43 can be written in the shear - dominated regime as @xmath44~\\delta[\\delta{\\bf \\tilde e}-\\delta{\\bf \\tilde e}_{sc } ( h_0 ) ] ~\\delta(\\delta{\\bf \\tilde i } ) , \\label{eq : delta_fun_cold}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 denotes the dirac delta function .",
    "the computational challenge of the shear - dominated regime is that strong scattering is possible for @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath46 in the course of an encounter can be quite substantial .",
    "thus we can not use the fokker - planck formalism for the shear - dominated scattering and one has to deal with the different moments of the master evolution equation ( 30 ) of paper ii in their general form .",
    "however , this does not pose an insurmountable problem because the probability distribution function of the shear - dominated scattering is a single - variable function only .",
    "an analytical fit to this function was calculated by petit & hnon ( 1986 , 1987b ) using results of numerical orbit integrations .",
    "this fit automatically takes horseshoe motion into account so that we do not have to worry about the complications associated with this type of orbit in the shear - dominated regime : one can see from the expression for @xmath47 ( petit & hnon 1987b ) that @xmath48 in the shear - dominated regime as @xmath49 .    using the deterministic form of @xmath41 [ substituting expression ( [ eq : delta_fun_cold ] ) into equation ( 30 ) of paper ii ] and the embryo s surface density in the form ( [ eq : em_surf_density ] ) we can take different moments of @xmath50 and @xmath51 . as a result we find the following set of equations describing the evolution of the planetesimal population due to the scattering by the embryo in the shear - dominated regime : @xmath52 , \\label{eq : surf_shear}\\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial t}\\left[2n(h)\\tilde\\sigma_{e}^2(h)\\right]= -\\frac{|a|\\mu_e^{1/3}}{\\pi}\\bigg[2n(h)\\tilde\\sigma_{e}^2(h)|h| \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\tilde p(h_0,h)n(h_0)\\left(2\\tilde\\sigma_{e}^2(h_0)+ \\delta ( { \\bf \\tilde e}_{sc})^2(h_0)\\right)|h_0|dh_0\\bigg ] , \\label{eq : ecc_shear}\\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left[2n(h)\\tilde\\sigma_{i}^2(h)\\right]= -\\frac{|a|\\mu_e^{1/3}}{\\pi}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left[2n(h)\\tilde\\sigma_{i}^2(h)|h|- \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\tilde p(h_0,h)2n(h_0)\\tilde\\sigma_{i}^2(h_0 )    \\label{eq : inc_shear}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 is the oort s constant characterizing the differential rotation of the disk ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , @xmath55 in a keplerian disk ( @xmath56 is the disk rotation frequency ) , @xmath29 is an integration variable having the meaning of the initial difference of the semimajor axes of interacting bodies , @xmath57 is defined in equation ( [ eq : de_cold ] ) , and @xmath58.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    terms in the r.h.s . of equation ( [ eq : inc_shear ] )",
    "are @xmath59 , i.e. are of the same order as @xmath60 which we have agreed to neglect .",
    "this inconsistency stems from the fact that we want our evolution equations to preserve the integrated jacobi constant ( [ eq : int_jacobi ] ) . for this reason we keep the terms in the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : inc_shear ] )",
    "( which are essentially the transport terms ) but neglect terms like @xmath60 if @xmath61 is assumed to be given by ( [ eq : de_cold ] ) . then @xmath62 which can be verified using equations ( [ eq : de_cold ] ) and ( [ eq : surf_shear])-([eq : inc_shear ] ) .",
    "also , one can easily check that equation ( [ eq : surf_shear ] ) conserves the total number of planetesimals in the disk .",
    "one technical issue merits mentioning at this point . in the shear - dominated regime",
    "the semimajor axis difference after the encounter @xmath14 is a single - valued function of @xmath29",
    ". however , the inverse function @xmath63 is multivalued ( petit & hnon 1987b ) .",
    "for this reason integrals of some quantity @xmath64 [ e.g. @xmath65 over @xmath66 in ( [ eq : surf_shear])-([eq : inc_shear ] ) result in @xmath67^{-1 } , \\label{eq : integration_rule}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the @xmath69-th root of the equation - function : @xmath70= \\sum\\limits_{j}p(x_j)/q^\\prime(x_j)$ ] , where @xmath71 is the @xmath72-th root of equation @xmath73 . ]",
    "@xmath74    the system ( [ eq : surf_shear])-([eq : inc_shear ] ) forms a closed set of equations needed to describe the disk evolution caused by embryo - planetesimal scattering in the shear - dominated regime . equation ( [ eq : surf_shear ] ) has already been derived by a different method in paper i , and now we have extended that analysis by taking random velocity evolution of the disk into account . following paper i we will be using @xmath47 in the analytical form suggested by petit & hnon ( 1987b ; see also appendix b of paper i ) .",
    "when the embryo - planetesimal scattering is in the dispersion - dominated regime the same simplifications as in the case of planetesimal - planetesimal scattering can be made : scattering is weak and this warrants the use of both the two - body approximation and the fokker - planck expansion . in this regime",
    "we can use many of the results obtained in paper ii .",
    "there are however some additional complications ; one of them is related to the aforementioned existence of horseshoe orbits . to discuss this issue",
    "we need to know which conditions should be fulfilled for horseshoe motion to take place in the dispersion - dominated velocity regime .",
    "horseshoe motion arises when the separation of the semimajor axes of interacting bodies is small . in this case",
    "their relative motion due to the shear in the disk is very slow ; for this reason even the weak gravitational force between the bodies at large azimuthal distance can lead to a considerable change of their angular momenta over a long time interval ; the relative motion of particles reverses , they turn around and move on almost closed trajectories until the next conjunction ( see figure [ fig : plot_orbits]a ) . in the solar system the best example of such motion",
    "is given by saturnian satellites janus & epimetheus ( murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "in contrast , planetesimals on pasing orbits pass each other after the interaction , usually without reversing their motion ( see figure [ fig : plot_orbits]b ) .",
    "in the shear - dominated regime these orbits typically have initial separations of semimajor axes larger than the hill radius .",
    "however in dispersion - dominated encounters the question of the spatial separation of horseshoe and passing orbits becomes more subtle .",
    "namouni ( 1999 ) has considered dispersion - dominated scattering in the planar case ( @xmath75 ) and suggested that for a given relative eccentricity @xmath76 the boundary of the horseshoe region is located at @xmath77 [ see also ida & nakazawa ( 1989 ) ] .",
    "this means that the more `` energetic '' the planetesimals are , the smaller their semimajor axis separation has to be for horseshoe motion to appear .",
    "this tendency is illustrated in figure [ fig : plot_orbits ] : orbits with the same value of @xmath78 exhibit different behavior depending on their random velocities  in the shear - dominated regime ( @xmath79 ) horseshoe motion takes place while in the dispersion - dominated ( @xmath80 ) the orbit is passing ; however if one decreases @xmath14 this orbit also becomes horseshoe ( which is shown by a trajectory with @xmath81 in figure [ fig : plot_orbits]a ) .",
    "it is easy to understand the reason for this dependence on the planetesimal random velocity : the higher the eccentricity the more time the approaching planetesimal spends far from the scatterer because it moves on a very large epicycle . as a result the mutual force is weak , the angular momentum exchange is small , and the planetesimal passes the scatterer instead of turning around . in other words ,",
    "the higher @xmath15 the less noticeable the presence of the scatterer is for the incoming planetesimal .    in the nonplanar case , on the basis of similar arguments",
    ", we suggest that the horseshoe boundary condition in the high - velocity regime should be replaced with @xmath82 to check this prediction and fix the proportionality constant @xmath69 , we have performed a set of orbit integrations in both the shear- and dispersion - dominated regimes .",
    "we have separated the outcomes of encounters into horseshoe orbits ( when @xmath14 was changing sign as a result of an encounter ) and passing ones ( when the sign of @xmath14 remained unchanged ) .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig : hs_separation ] .",
    "one can see a rather clean separation between the horseshoe orbits ( red dots ) and passing ones ( blue dots ) .",
    "there are some red dots which appear in the region mostly occupied by the passing orbits , but they originate from large - angle scattering during close encounters and are not librating orbits as normal horseshoes are .",
    "the separation condition ( [ eq : my_cond_eower ] ) fits the boundary between the two types of orbits very well when @xmath83 if we take @xmath84 ( dashed curve in figure [ fig : hs_separation ] ) .",
    "however , as we move away from the strongly dispersion - dominated regime some deviations from ( [ eq : my_cond_eower ] ) appear .",
    "this is not surprising because small @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to the shear - dominated regime , and then the horseshoe region has a well - defined boundary at @xmath85 .",
    "we have found that the shape of the horseshoe - passing boundary can be fit rather accurately by the following condition @xmath86 which is shown by the solid curve on figure [ fig : hs_separation ] would predict @xmath87 in the shear - dominated regime slightly different from that suggested by petit & hnon ( 1987b ) : @xmath88 instead of @xmath89 .",
    "however , such a small difference is unlikely to be important for our purposes . ] .",
    "the relative motion of interacting planetesimals in the horseshoe regime can be split into the slow shear motion of the guiding centers and the fast epicyclic motion .",
    "when such a separation is legitimate some quantities associated with the fast motion called adiabatic invariants should be conserved ( landau & lifshitz 1989 ) .",
    "it was shown by hnon & petit ( 1986 ) and hasegawa & nakazawa ( 1990 ) that the absolute value of the relative semimajor axis difference , relative eccentricity and relative inclination are all separately conserved quantities in the course of a horseshoe encounter , and that they are the adiabatic invariants of this type of motion .",
    "thus the quantities @xmath99 before the encounter are related to their values after , @xmath100 , as @xmath101 it follows from this conservation of adiabatic invariants that the effect of the embryo - planetesimal encounters in the horseshoe region is to exchange planetesimals at symmetric orbits ( @xmath14 and @xmath102 ) .",
    "interacting bodies just librate between successive close approaches when they reverse the direction of their motion .",
    "because the embryo is much more massive than the planetesimals and its @xmath15 and @xmath16 are zero , the relative motion in the embryo - planetesimal system is equivalent to the motion of planetesimals . the scattering probability for the horseshoe motion @xmath103 looks like @xmath104 .",
    "using this result we can write down the evolution equation of some quantity @xmath105 by analogy with equations ( [ eq : surf_shear])-([eq : inc_shear ] ) in a very simple form : @xmath106 .",
    "\\label{eq : scat_hs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our case @xmath105 can be the planetesimal surface density @xmath107 , horizontal epicyclic energy @xmath108 or vertical epicyclic energy @xmath109 .      to describe the embryo - planetesimal interaction on passing orbits in the dispersion - dominated regime we will use the results for the scattering in this regime derived in paper ii , namely equations ( 49)-(51 ) and ( 52)-(55 ) .",
    "we substitute embryo s surface number density in the form ( [ eq : em_surf_density ] ) for the surface density of approaching bodies @xmath110 , assume that @xmath111 and that @xmath112 . as a result",
    "we obtain the following system @xmath113 , \\label{eq : em_surf}\\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left[2n(h)\\tilde \\sigma_{e}^2(h)\\right]= \\frac{|a|\\mu_e^{1/3}}{\\pi}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left [    -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h}\\left(|h|   \\langle({\\bf \\tilde e}^2 + 2{\\bf \\tilde e}\\cdot\\delta{\\bf \\tilde e } ) \\delta \\tilde h \\rangle n\\right ) + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial h^2}\\left(|h|   \\langle{\\bf \\tilde e}^2(\\delta \\tilde h)^2 \\rangle n\\right)\\right ] , \\label{eq : em_s_e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and an equation for the inclination evolution analogous to ( [ eq : em_s_e ] ) .",
    "these formulae are only valid in the region of space restricted by the condition ( [ eq : pass_cond ] ) .",
    "analytical expressions for the scattering coefficients @xmath114 , and @xmath115 can be found in paper ii .",
    "the proper boundary conditions for this system will be derived in  [ subsubsect : boundary_cond ] .    at this point",
    "we should address a subtle issue which was not important for the planetesimal - planetesimal scattering but becomes nontrivial for the embryo - planetesimal interaction .",
    "it is related to the fact that planetesimals at different initial separations are driven past the embryo by the differential shear at different rates .",
    "those which initially had @xmath116 quickly approach the embryo , experience scattering , and quickly depart . on the approach and departure",
    "stages their orbital parameters do not have time to change except when they are close to the embryo .",
    "thus , we can assume that values of @xmath117 far from the embryo are the same as at the point of closest approach if initially @xmath116 .",
    "however , planetesimals which start their motion not far from the horseshoe orbits boundary are not moving very fast ( because this boundary is located at @xmath118 ) . as a result , for these planetesimals the exchange of the angular momentum before and after the close encounter can be important , just as in the case of horseshoe orbits , where such an exchange essentially prevents close encounters from happening .",
    "consequently , the asymptotic value of the separation @xmath14 is not the same as its value at the close encounter .",
    "we must also ask whether the eccentricity and inclination are affected in a similar way .",
    "in this situation @xmath119 and @xmath120 are not perfectly conserved adiabatic invariants ( frequencies of the two superposed motions are not very strongly different from each other ) but we probably will not make a huge mistake by assuming that they still are conserved on the approach and departure stages .",
    "thus , we can draw the following picture of scattering for these orbits : as the planetesimal gets closer to the embryo the absolute value of @xmath14 gets smaller as a result of the angular momentum exchange with the embryo , while the eccentricity and inclination are preserved ( see figure [ fig : illustration ] ) . at the point of closest approach ,",
    "the planetesimal orbital parameters experience a quick variation as a result of close encounter with the embryo .",
    "after that , on the departure stage , the embryo slowly changes the angular momentum of the planetesimal such that @xmath121 increases .",
    "these variations of @xmath14 at constant @xmath119 and @xmath120 do not contradict the conservation of the jacobi constant ( [ eq : jacobi ] ) because the gravitational potential due to the embryo changes in the course of planetesimal approach and departure as well .",
    "in fact , using the conservation of jacobi constant we derive a prescription for the relation between the semimajor axis difference @xmath14 far from the embryo and its value at the moment of the close encounter , @xmath122 . to do this",
    "we note that at the moment of the closest approach the distance between the embryo and planetesimal in units of the embryo s hill radius is of order @xmath123 .",
    "then the conservation of the jacobi constant ( [ eq : jacobi ] ) tells us that @xmath124 .",
    "this empirical expression may be inaccurate if one applies it for @xmath125 .",
    "this can be remedied using the following approximate prescription @xmath126 where the numerical values of constants @xmath127 and @xmath128 were fixed by comparison with orbit integrations . whenever the planetesimal disk has a distribution of eccentricities and inclinations",
    "we replace @xmath15 and @xmath16 in ( [ eq : h_hprime ] ) with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the relationship ( [ eq : h_hprime ] ) is certainly not very accurate .",
    "however , this transformation is satisfactory for our purposes since the complete separation of horseshoe and passing orbits we are assuming is a rather crude approximation anyway .    to better understand the consequences and importance of this effect it is instructive to look at the distribution function of planetesimal scattering @xmath129 in the dispersion - dominated regime [ by definition @xmath130 is the probability that a planetesimal initially at @xmath29 is scattered into the interval @xmath131 .",
    "we calculate this function analytically in appendix [ app : scat_erobab ] and represent it in the following form : @xmath132 where @xmath133^{1/2 } , \\label{eq : d_def1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the scattering coefficients ( see paper ii ) , and @xmath136 is the usual coulomb logarithm . to compute @xmath129 accounting for the distribution of planetesimal eccentricities and inclinations",
    "one simply needs to use the values of @xmath134 and @xmath135 averaged over this distribution ( they are given in  4 of paper ii for the case of gaussian distribution of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",

    "however , one can also immediately notice one important feature of the simulated @xmath129 : there are no orbits scattered in a region with a width @xmath141 around the embryo s location , and this is in contrast with the analytical result ( [ eq : dif_erobab_cutoff1 ] ) which exhibits no such feature . a similar `` gap '' in the distribution of scattered orbits",

    "planetesimals with the semimajor axes close to the embryo s orbit perform horseshoe motion ( see  [ subsect : em_dispersion ] ) . as a result ,",

    "the depression formed in the instanteneous surface density at the location of the embryo is weaker than the gap in @xmath107 because epicyclic motion allows planetesimals to penetrate inside the depression of @xmath107 .",
    "the absence of a clear gap is due to the weakness of the individual embryo - planetesimal scattering in the dispersion - dominated regime . in the shear - dominated disk ,",
    "scattering is much stronger and a gap is cleared by the embryo on a rather short timescale ( see paper i and appendix [ app : intermediate_velocity ] ) . it is also obvious that the evolution of the disk surface density is accompanied by a considerable change in kinematic properties of planetesimal population , as required by the conservation of jacobi constant .",
    "thus , the dynamical evolution of the disk is an important ingredient of the gap formation process which justifies the need for the self - consistent theory such as the one presented here .",
    "the agreement between the analytical and numerical results in the dispersion - dominated regime is in general pretty good given the approximate nature of the theory and the small number of fitting parameters we are using  essentially only the constants in ( [ eq : my_cond ] ) , ( [ eq : h_hprime ] ) , and ( [ eq : lam_choice ] ) are free parameters , and it turns out that the solutions of equations ( [ eq : em_surf])-([eq : em_s_e ] ) depend on their particular choice only very weakly .",
    "we believe that minor discrepancies between the outcomes of analytical and numerical approaches can be accounted for by going to the next order in @xmath201 and properly including the effects of the distant encounters .",
    "we expect our analytical formulation to be even more accurate for larger values of @xmath18 , @xmath19 but we have not investigated these because the computational requirements of the numerical simulations become prohibitive .",
    "we postpone the detailed exploration of these subjects for the future .",
    "the accretion rate of planetesimals by the embryo @xmath202 is another observable ( in addition to the spatial distributions of @xmath107 , @xmath200 , and @xmath199 ) which can be computed both analytically and numerically and used as a check of our calculations .",
    "in addition , it is a very important quantity by itself for any realistic modelling of planet formation .",
    "a lot of work has been devoted to the study of the planetary accretion in homogeneous planetesimal disks in the context of the planetary mass growth ( greenzweig & lissauer 1990 , 1992 ) and the origin of planetary spins and obliquities ( dones & tremaine 1993 ) .",
    "the results of these authors are not directly applicable to the inhomogeneous disks that are our primary focus but can be used as limiting cases to check our analytical predictions in the more general case of nonuniform distribution of planetesimals .      in the shear - dominated regime",

    "we will be using this prescription for the embryo s accretion rate in upcoming work when dealing with the evolution of the planetesimal disk coupled to the embryo s growth .",
    "from the results of the orbit integrations described in  [ subsubsect : orbit_integrations ] one can see that the embryo - planetesimal interaction leads to a decrease in the surface density of planetesimals near the embryo in the region of passing orbits .",
    "the width of the surface density depression is typically of the order of the planetesimal eccentricity dispersion @xmath200 . at the same time the distribution of planetesimals on horseshoe orbits",
    "stays unaffected by the embryo .",
    "this is very similar to the behavior of the surface density in the shear - dominated regime , as studied in paper i. in that case the reason for such behavior was very clear : scattering of a planetesimal initially on a circular orbit can only increase its eccentricity and inclination which leads to the increase of @xmath121 ( a result of jacobi constant conservation ) and , consequently , to the repulsion of planetesimal orbits .",
    "in paper i planetesimals were kept on circular orbits at all times , and a gap with a width of several @xmath12 was carved near the embryo s orbit .    in the kinematically hot regime",
    "the reasoning is not so simple . from equation ( [ eq : dif_erobab_cutoff1 ] ) and figure [ fig : monte_carlo_erobab ] one can see that scattered planetesimals can have @xmath220 as well as @xmath221 for a fixed @xmath14 depending on their eccentricities , inclinations , and epicyclic phases .",
    "moreover , from our calculation of the scattering coefficients in the dispersion - dominated regime ( paper ii , see also the analogous result in ida 2000 ) we know that @xmath222",
    ". using this result ida ( 2000 ) suggested that in the kinematically hot planetesimal disk embryo should _ attract _ planetesimal orbits rather than _ repel _ them .",
    "the outcome of such an interaction would be a growth of planetesimal surface density at the embryo s location .",
    "however , this conclusions is misleading .",
    "what really determines the behavior of the planetesimal surface density near the embryo and the nature of the embryo - planetesimal interaction is the direction of the _ flux _ of planetesimals .",
    "the embryo repels planetesimals and carves a gap when this flux is directed away from the embryo ; it attracts planetesimals and increases their nearby surface density when this flux is directed towards the embryo .",
    "the condition @xmath222 by itself can not guarantee that the planetesimal flux is directed towards the embryo s orbit because these quantities are not simply related ; at the same time a small fraction of planetesimals can be scattered towards the embryo and have large negative values of @xmath46 . with properly chosen weights",

    "another complication precluding the use of the sign of @xmath175 as an indicator of planetesimal disk evolution is that @xmath223 ( for @xmath224 ) does not always mean that planetesimal orbit gets closer to the embryo . if for example @xmath225 then the absolute value of the semimajor axis separation after the encounter is larger than it was before , which is indicative of repulsion rather than attraction .",
    "using the method described in appendix a of paper i , we can calculate the outward flux of planetesimals @xmath226 driven by the embryo - planetesimal interactions .",
    "we evaluate this flux in a homogeneous disk . for the general scattering probability function @xmath227",

    "this implies that the embryo tends to _ repel _ planetesimals by driving a flux directed away from its orbit .",
    "this conclusion disagrees with the predictions based on the sign of @xmath175 ( ida 2000 ) .",
    "the planetesimal flux vanishes as @xmath240 grows but distant encounters ( not included in figure [ fig : flux ] ) will dominate at large @xmath240 and they also always drive planetesimals away from the embryo ( goldreich & tremaine 1982 ; petit & hnon 1987a ) .",
    "thus , it appears that repulsion is the only possible outcome of the embryo - planetesimal gravitational interaction even in the dispersion - dominated velocity regime .",
    "figure [ fig : flux ] seems to imply that the planetesimal surface density will always grow because @xmath226 decreases with @xmath14 .",
    "this is not the case because the boundary condition ( [ eq : surf_cond_reduced ] ) forces @xmath244 at the horseshoe - passing orbit boundary @xmath163 .",
    "this means that there is actually a transition zone near @xmath245 in which flux steeply increases from @xmath93 to its value given by ( [ eq : flux_final ] ) .",
    "the width of this zone is infinitesimal initially but it rapidly expands as the planetesimal disk evolves under the action of the embryo s gravity . within the transition region @xmath226 is positive and increases with @xmath14 meaning that the planetesimal surface density decays there .",
    "this is exactly what was observed in the analytical calculations and numerical orbit integrations in  [ subsubsect : orbit_integrations ] .",
    "the slowdown of the disk evolution obvious from figures [ fig : evolution_3_3 ] and [ fig : evolution_4_2 ] is caused not only by the growth of epicyclic energy of the disk ( which lengthens the disk dynamical timescale ) but also by the gradual expansion of the transition zone leading to a decrease in the planetesimal flux gradient and slower disk evolution .",
    "we have studied the embryo - planetesimal interaction in the gravitational field of a central star .",
    "two different cases were explored : when the interaction between the embryo and planetesimals occurs in the shear - dominated and in the dispersion - dominated regimes .",
    "the treatment of the first case parallels that of paper i but is complicated by the fact that now we explicitly include the evolution of not only the surface density but also the eccentricity and inclination of planetesimals in the disk .",
    "our study of the dispersion - dominated regime relies on the methods of kinetic theory , and it uses many of the results obtained in paper ii . however our present treatment is more refined since the description of embryo - planetesimal scattering requires clarifying many details which were not important for the planetesimal - planetesimal interactions .",
    "in particular we have to study not only passing but also horseshoe orbits of planetesimals to determine the spatial distribution of the disk properties . to do this we propose a condition which separates the horseshoe and passing orbits and check its viability using numerical orbit integrations .",
    "angular momentum exchange between the embryo and planetesimal long before and after their closest approach turns out to be important for the scattering on passing orbits near the horseshoe boundary .",
    "we illustrate this point by comparing the analytical scattering probability function with the one obtained from numerical integrations .",
    "a simple method to account for this effect in our fokker - planck approach is proposed .",
    "taken together all these refinements are shown to provide rather good agreement with the results of the numerical orbit integrations .",
    "thus we hope to have grasped the most important features of the embryo - planetesimal interaction by our theoretical approach .",
    "this does not mean that our treatment of the embryo - planetesimal interaction is complete .",
    "we have only focussed on the most important , dominant effects , and there is certainly room for additional refinements , which would farther improve the agreement with numerical results .",
    "the calculation of the scattering coefficients to the next order in @xmath201 would provide us with subdominant corrections which might be important for modest values of @xmath200 and @xmath199 .",
    "one can certainly do a better job in treating distant encounters , calculating various coefficients entering formulae ( [ eq : my_cond ] ) , ( [ eq : h_hprime ] ) , etc . or the interpolating functions of appendix [ app : intermediate_velocity ] , using a larger set of numerical orbit integrations .",
    "on a somewhat deeper level , one can try to come up with a more sophisticated treatment of the horseshoe - passing orbits separation ( instead of the complete spatial separation of these two types of orbits assumed in this paper ) .",
    "our purely deterministic treatment of the shear - dominated regime can also be improved , which would ameliorate the comparison with numerical results in the intermediate velocity regime ( see appendix [ app : intermediate_velocity ] ) .",
    "the recoil of the embryo and the excitation of the embryo s eccentricity and inclination in the course of the planetesimal gravitational scattering can be important in some applications , such as the embryo s migration ( tanaka & ida 1999 ) or its interaction with the embryos nearby ( tanaka & ida 1997 ) .",
    "our treatment relies on the use of the schwarzschild velocity distribution which was demonstrated to be applicable in the dispersion - dominated regime ( greenzweig & lissauer 1992 ) , but the deviations from this assumption could be important e.g. in the intermediate velocity regime , and this subject can also be pursued farther .",
    "all these refinements would better the quantitative agreement between the analytical theory and numerical results . but reasonably good accord is provided even by our basic treatment developed here , especially in the dispersion - dominated case where the assumptions we make are the most justifiable .",
    "we also dwell upon the question of the direction of the embryo - planetesimal interaction , namely whether it leads to the repulsion of planetesimal orbits from the embryo or to their attraction .",
    "the latter outcome has been favored in some scenarios ( ida 2000 ) and is based on the fact that in the dispersion - dominated regime embryo _ on average _ tends to attract planetesimal semimajor axes toward its orbit .",
    "we demonstrate , however , that the average change of planetesimal semimajor axes can not serve a standard for determining the direction of the embryo - planetesimal interaction because the transport of the angular momentum ( associated with the changes in semimajor axes ) is not the same as the bulk motion of the disk material .",
