    "the cahn - hilliard equation was proposed by cahn and hilliard in @xcite , @xcite as a simple model of the phase separation process , where at a fixed temperature the two components of a binary fluid spontaneously separate and form domains that are pure in each component .",
    "let @xmath0 denote a self - adjoint extension of a laplace operator .",
    "then the cahn - hilliard equation may be stated in the following form @xmath1    global existence for solutions to the cahn - hilliard equation has been established by elliott and songmu @xcite , and caffarelli and muler @xcite . in the setup of singular manifolds",
    "however , there is still a question of asymptotics of solutions at the singular strata .",
    "this aspect has been studied by the recent work of roidos and schrohe @xcite in the context of manifolds with isolated conical singularities , which has motivated the present discussion here . using the notion of maximal regularity ,",
    "they establish short time existence of solutions to the cahn - hilliard equation in certain weighted mellin - sobolev spaces which then yields regularity and asymptotics of solutions near the conical point .    in this paper",
    "we study the cahn - hilliard equation in the geometric setup of spaces with incomplete edges , which generalizes the notion of isolated conical singularities .",
    "our method is different from @xcite and uses the microlocal construction of the heat kernel for the bi - laplacian .",
    "precise analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the heat kernel allows for a derivation of the mapping properties of the heat operator and a subsequent argument on the short time existence for certain semi - linear equations of fourth order , in analogy to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "existence and asymptotics for solutions to the cahn - hilliard equation comes as an application of the general results .",
    "the microlocal analysis of the biharmonic heat kernel on edge spaces also allows for derivation of schauder estimates and ultimately leads to short time existence results for fourth order pde s , including the bock flow @xcite on singular spaces",
    ". this will be the subject of forthcoming analysis .",
    "we also point out that our approach is not limited to squares of laplacians on functions , but yields similar results for general powers of hodge laplacians on differential forms along the same lines .",
    "our main result may be summarized briefly as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 be a riemannian manifold with an admissible riemannian incomplete edge metric @xmath3 .",
    "then the biharmonic heat kernel @xmath4 for the friedrichs self - adjoint extension of the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath5 lifts to a polyhomogeneous distribution on a blowup of @xmath6 and defines a biharmonic heat operator with various mapping properties , such that certain semi - linear fourth order equations , among then the cahn - hilliard equation , admit a short time solution of a certain regularity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce the basic geometry of incomplete edge spaces in  [ edge - section ] .",
    "we then provide a microlocal construction of the heat kernel for a certain self - adjoint extension of the bi - laplacian in  [ heat - section ] .",
    "we proceed with with establishing mapping properties of the biharmonic heat operator in  [ mapping - section ] .",
    "we conclude with a short time existence result for certain semi - linear equations of fourth order and apply the analysis to the particular example of the cahn - hilliard equation in  [ short - section ] .",
