    "wave problems in unbounded media can occur in many applications in mechanics and engineering such as in acoustics , solid mechanics , electromagnetics , etc .",
    "it is well known that analytical solutions for such problems are available only for some special cases . on the contrary ,",
    "numerical methods can be applied to many complex problems .",
    "physically , for problems in infinite domains , the energy is produced by sources in the region to be analyzed and must escape to infinity . for methods solving the problem on a bounded domain like the finite element method , it introduces the difficulty of an artificial boundary to get a bounded domain",
    ". this boundary must be such that the energy crosses it without reflection and special conditions must be specified at the artificial boundary to reproduce this phenomena . generally , these can be classified into local or global boundary conditions . with a global condition",
    "all degrees of freedom ( dofs ) on the boundary are coupled while a local condition connects only neighboring dofs .",
    "the first global method which has been used for solving such problems was the boundary element method .",
    "this method is well adapted for infinite domains and is described in numerous classical textbooks like @xcite .",
    "it consists in solving an equation on the boundary of the domain only and the radiation conditions are taken into account analytically .",
    "it also reduces the dimension of the problem to a surface in 3d and to a curve in 2d decreasing thus the size of the linear problem to solve .",
    "however , the final problem involves full matrices which are also generally non symmetrical .",
    "it is also mainly limited to linear problems and to homogeneous domains or otherwise one has to introduce special and complex techniques to deal with non linear or non homogeneous situations .",
    "there are also singularities in the integrals which need special attention for the numerical integrations .",
    "so this method is interesting and has been extensively used but it can lead to heavy computations when the number of degrees of freedom increases .",
    "more information on such techniques can be found in the historical and review papers @xcite .    in the other approaches",
    ", the computational domain is truncated at some distance and boundary conditions are imposed at this artificial boundary .",
    "these conditions at finite distance must simulate as closely as possible the exact radiation condition at infinity .",
    "an approach leading to a global boundary condition is the dirichlet to neumann ( dtn ) mapping proposed by @xcite and in an earlier version by @xcite .",
    "it consists in dividing the domain into a finite part containing the sources and an infinite domain of simple shape .",
    "the solution in the infinite domain is solved analytically , for example by series expansions , and an exact impedance relation is obtained on the boundary between the finite and infinite domains .",
    "this relation links the variable and its normal derivative on the whole boundary .",
    "the dtn mapping is thus non local and every node on the boundary is connected to all other nodes .",
    "this gives a full matrix for the nodes of the boundary which partially destroys the sparse matrix of the fem and increases substantially the computing resources needed to get the solution .",
    "the solution has to be found in the exterior domain by analytical or numerical methods .",
    "when the analytical solution can be found , it is generally under the form of a series expansion",
    ". the number of terms in the expansion must be sufficient for an accurate solution which can lead to heavy computations .",
    "developments of the method can be found in @xcite .",
    "an application to the case of wave scattering in plates is also found in @xcite .",
    "the other methods are local and the condition at a node involves only neighboring nodes which make them less demanding in computing resources and much easier to implement in a finite element code but also less accurate . a first possibility of such approaches is the use of infinite elements as proposed by @xcite .",
    "it consists in developing special elements with a behavior at infinity reflecting that of analytical solutions obtained for the same type of problems . for wave problems , it involves complex - valued basis functions with outwarding propagation wave - like behavior in the radial direction .",
    "the elements were further developed by @xcite to considered other coordinate systems such as expansions in prolate coordinates .",
    "this method is interesting but the inclusion of infinite elements requires the development of special elements and these elements can depend on decay parameters which have to be accurately chosen .",
    "a review of these methods has been proposed by @xcite .    in the perfectly matched layer proposed by @xcite , originally for electromagnetic waves , an exterior layer of finite thickness",
    "is introduced around the bounded domain .",
    "the absorption in this domain is increasing as we move towards the exterior such that outgoing waves are absorbed before reaching the exterior truncation boundary .",
    "the number of elements in the layer , its thickness , the variation of the absorption properties have to be carefully chosen to optimize the efficiency of the method . this efficiency is better for a layer with a large thickness but this can lead to a significant increase in the number of elements in the finite element model .",
    "various developments of the method can be found in @xcite and its optimization in @xcite .",
    "otherwise , various classes of absorbing boundary conditions were also developed by @xcite .",
    "they consist in the numerical approximation of differential operators on the boundary .",
    "for instance , examples of the application of bayliss - turkel conditions are presented by @xcite .",
    "however , the more accurate boundary conditions involve high order derivatives on the boundary which are difficult to implement in the finite element method @xcite .",
    "finally , it was proved by @xcite that , in fact , the perfectly matched layer and the absorbing boundary conditions were closely connected .",
    "the helmholtz equation was also solved with these two boundary conditions by @xcite and these conditions were compared and optimized to minimize the reflection .",
    "other boundary conditions involving only second order derivatives have also been proposed .",
    "they introduce auxiliary variables and systems of equations on the boundary which lead to high order boundary conditions , see @xcite for a review of such non - reflecting boundary ( nrbc ) methods .",
    "they were mainly developed for acoustic problems but in @xcite a local boundary condition for elastic waves has been proposed . in @xcite",
    "an impedance boundary condition in new coordinates was developed for the convected helmholtz equation .",
    "for fluid dynamic problems , @xcite developed lagrange multipliers for imposing various absorbing boundary conditions for cases where the type and the number of boundary conditions can change , for instance as the flow changes from subsonic to supersonic regimes and its direction varies with time . a general review of the methods described in the precedent paragraphs for various dynamic",
    ", acoustic and wave propagation problems can be found in @xcite .",
    "comparisons are also made between the different methods .    in the present study , another local method is proposed .",
    "this method works on discrete systems directly , in contrast with many existing absorbing boundary conditions which are written on the continuous differential equations and discretized after .",
    "the principle of the method is to compute wave propagations in groups of elements near the boundary from the dynamic stiffness matrix of these elements .",
    "then , a boundary condition is obtained for cancelling the reflected waves .",
    "this condition is finally written as an impedance boundary condition relating the force and displacement degrees of freedom on the boundary .",
    "the approach is based on the waveguide theory proposed by @xcite and is used to determine absorbing boundary conditions at the truncation boundary of 2d periodic media . only information related to one period , obtained from any standard fe software ( the discrete stiffness and mass matrices and the nodal coordinates )",
    "are required to formulate the method .",
    "the advantage is that it can be applied to media with various complex behaviors .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the methodology for determining absorbing boundary conditions for periodic media is described .",
    "then , a discussion for the application of the method to general media is proposed . in section 3 ,",
    "a simple application is proposed to show the results of the method in a case where detailed computations can be done . in section 4 ,",
    "two examples of finite element computations in acoustics and elastodynamics are presented .",
    "they allow to check the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for more complex cases .",
    "finally , the paper is closed with some conclusions .",
    "we suppose that we want to solve a mechanical problem on an infinite domain exterior to the bounded domain @xmath0 ( see figure [ fig01 ] ) .",
    "the infinite domain is approximated by the finite domain @xmath1 which is exterior to @xmath0 and is limited by the exterior boundary @xmath2 .",
    "we are looking for a solution with radiating condition at infinity which means that the solution should be outgoing near the boundary @xmath2 . near this exterior boundary",
    "the solution can be seen as composed of incident waves denoted @xmath3 and reflected waves @xmath4 . for a perfectly absorbing boundary , one should have @xmath5 .",
    "in fact this condition is very difficult to implement in the numerical solutions of such problems .",
    "indeed , only the global solution is easily computed but the decomposition into incident and reflected waves is difficult to obtain .",
    "the problem is thus to find an appropriate boundary condition to impose on the exterior boundary to finally get @xmath6 on the solution",
    ". to be easily included in a finite element model the searched boundary condition should be local and the condition at a node of the boundary should involve only neighboring nodes .",
    "the approach proposed in this paper consists in studying this problem by first considering the case of periodic media . for this case ,",
    "positive and negative waves and their amplitudes @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be computed by the method presented below . then an exact boundary condition can be formulated for a half - plane boundary .",
    "it is further shown how this condition can be approximated by a local condition on the boundary .",
    "as homogeneous media are special cases of periodic media , the method presented here applies also to homogeneous media . before considering the general case ,",
    "a simple example for the klein gordon equation will be presented .",
    "consider first the stationary klein gordon equation given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the solution and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are real parameters .",
    "this equation is discretized with linear two nodes elements such that @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the values of the function at the two nodes of the element .",
    "the discretization of the first and second parts of relation ( [ eqc01 ] ) leads , for an element of length @xmath16 , to the matrices @xmath17\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathbf{m } = \\frac{l}{6}\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 2\\ & 1 \\\\ 1\\ & 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] and the dynamic stiffness matrix of one element is given by @xmath18 + \\frac{l}{6}(k^2-m^2)\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 2\\ & 1 \\\\ 1\\ & 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] waves of propagating constant @xmath19 are such that @xmath20 leading in an element to @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the components of the matrix @xmath23 .",

    "compared to the classical boundary condition on the right ( and exact in this case ) @xmath37 , the relative error is @xmath38 which depends mainly on the size of the element relatively to the wavelength .",
    "the present boundary condition has been obtained entirely from the discrete matrices without any knowledge of the analytical solution of the problem .    to estimate the reflection coefficient created by such a boundary condition consider an incident wave @xmath39 on the boundary . a reflected wave @xmath40",
    "is created . the total solution and its associated force",
    "are given by @xmath41 writing the boundary condition ( [ eq01a ] ) , for instance by taking the boundary at @xmath42 , yields @xmath43 so the reflection coefficient is finally given by @xmath44 this coefficient is low and of second order when @xmath45 .      in this section",
    "we present the general outline of the method before starting a more rigorous developement in the following section .",

    "will be computed directly from the discrete equations for general linear media .",
