    "recently , the opal and delphi collaborations measured the polarizations of vector mesons in @xmath1 annihilation at @xmath2 pole at lep .",
    "the data@xcite show clearly that the vector mesons in particular those with large momentum fraction favor the helicity zero state . obviously , the study of this subject should provide us important information on the hadronization mechanism especially the spin effects in fragmentation processes . compared with hyperons , the study of vector meson polarization has two advantages : first , the decay contribution of heavier hadrons to vector meson production is much smaller .",
    "second , the production rate of vector meson is in general higer than that of hyperon . it is thus interesting and important to ask what we can learn from the data about the polarization of the quarks and antiquarks created in the fragmentation process .    to answer the above - mentioned question , in a recent paper@xcite , we calculated the helicity density matrix of vector mesons by assuming that the spin of vector meson is just the sum of the spin of the quark and that of the antiquark which combine into a vector meson . by comparing the obtained results with the data",
    ", we found that the lep data give a strong constraint on the polarization of the antiquark created in the fragmentation process .",
    "we thus extend our calculations to the deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) process and the high @xmath3 jets in polarized high energy @xmath0 collisions . in this talk",
    ", i will make a brief summary of the calculations in ref .",
    "2 and 3 , present the main results and make a short discussion .",
    "to calculate the helicity density matrix of a vector meson produced in the fragmentation of a polarized quark @xmath4 , we divide the produced vector mesons into the following two groups and consider them separately : ( a ) those which contain the initial quark @xmath4 s or the initial antiquark @xmath5 s ; ( b ) those which do nt contain the initial quark or antiquark .",
    "the spin density matrix @xmath6 for the vector meson @xmath7 is given by : @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the average number and spin density matrix of vector mesons from ( a ) ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are those from ( b ) .",
    "@xmath13= @xmath14 + @xmath11 is the total number of vector mesons and @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the momentum of vector meson and @xmath19 is the total @xmath1 center of mass energy .",
    "the average numbers @xmath9 and @xmath11 are determined by the hadronization mechnism and can be calculated using hadronization models@xcite as implemented by the monte - carlo events generators .",
    "the vector mesons from group ( b ) are taken as unpolarized thus @xmath12=1/3 . for those from group ( a ) , i.e. , those which contain the @xmath4 ( @xmath20 ) and a @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) created in the fragmentation process , @xmath7=@xmath23 or @xmath7=@xmath24 , the spin density matrix @xmath10 can be calculated from the direct product of the spin density matrix @xmath25 for @xmath4 ( or @xmath26 for @xmath20 ) and that @xmath27 for the antiquark @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 for q ) . for explicity , we take @xmath7=@xmath23 .",
    "the spin density matrix of the @xmath30 system is @xmath31=@xmath25@xmath32@xmath33 . transforming to the coupled basis @xmath34 ( where @xmath35=@xmath36+@xmath37 ) , we obtain , @xmath38 where @xmath39=@xmath40 , @xmath41=@xmath42 and @xmath43 is the polarization of the initial quark @xmath44 ; @xmath45 ) is the polarization vector of @xmath28 in the helicity frame of @xmath44 in which the @xmath15-axis is taken as the moving direction of @xmath44 .    after transforming the above result to the helicity basis of the produced vector meson",
    ", we obtain the helicity density matrix element @xmath46 , i.e. , the probability for vector meson in the helicity zero state , @xmath47 from this result , we can already see that @xmath48@xmath491/3 only if @xmath43 and @xmath50 have opposite signs .",
    "both opal and delphi data@xcite explicitly show that @xmath51@xmath491/3 for all the vector mesons except for @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that @xmath50@xmath530 and has the opposite sign as @xmath43 in these cases .",
    "we use eq . ( 3 ) to calculate @xmath56 in which the only free parameter is @xmath50 .",
    "we first calculate @xmath46 for @xmath57 as a function of @xmath15 since the corresponding data is available@xcite . to fit the data , the value of @xmath50 has to be quite large . in fig .",
    "2 we show the results obtained by taking @xmath50=0.48 , which can fit the data reasonably well .",
    "similiar calculations can certainly be made for other vector mesons such as @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "but , for these mesons , only the average values of @xmath46 in certain @xmath15 ranges are available , and we integrate the @xmath15 dependent @xmath46 over certain @xmath15 region .",
    "we found out that , for most of the vector mesons , the resulting @xmath50 can be written as @xmath50=@xmath63 with @xmath64 is common for most of the @xmath44 s .",
    "the results of @xmath64=0.51 as determined above from the data for @xmath57 can be seen in table 1 of ref .",
