    "the focus of this paper is the following basic question : given two closed contact 3-manifolds @xmath0 and @xmath1 , can a legendrian surgery on a link in @xmath0 produce @xmath1 ?",
    "if so , what can be said about the number of components of the surgery link ? what happens if we do nt fix contact structures @xmath2 and @xmath3 , but just want to obtain , say , a tight @xmath4 from a tight @xmath5 ?",

    "such cobordisms were studied by etnyre and honda @xcite ; in particular , they showed a stein cobordism between @xmath0 and @xmath1 exists whenever @xmath0 is overtwisted . if @xmath0 is stein fillable , a legendrian surgery produces a stein filling of @xmath1 , and one can try to find obstructions to legendrian surgeries by considering stein fillings . from known",
    "classification theorems @xcite we immediately see , for example , that standard contact structures on @xmath6 can not be obtained from any lens space except @xmath7 ( see section [ fillings ] for more results of this sort ) .",
    "more interestingly , we examine stein fillings of planar open books to prove    [ self ] no tight lens space can be obtained from itself by legendrian surgery on a link .    by contrast , it is easy to show that every overtwisted contact manifold can be obtain from itself by a legendrian surgery on an appropriate legendrian unknot ( see proposition [ cando ] ) .",
    "theorem [ self ] applies more generally to fillable contact 3-manifolds admitting planar open books . to prove the theorem",
    ", we show that for any contact structure supported by a planar open book , there is a bound on the second betti number of its fillings ( see corollary [ bound ] ) .",
    "when a stein cobordism from @xmath0 to @xmath1 exists , one can wonder about its betti numbers ( note that cobordisms we consider arise from surgeries , and consist of 2-handles only ) . in particular , we can ask whether @xmath1 can be obtained from @xmath0 by a legendrian surgery on a single knot ; for the question to be meaningful , we will assume that obvious obstructions to existence of such surgery , both from the topological viewpoint ( eg from the singular homology of @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) and from the homotopy classes of contact structures all vanish . of course , this question is closely related to the question of integral knot surgery : can @xmath4 be obtained from @xmath5 by an integral surgery on a single knot ?",
    "such knot surgery questions have been studied by means of many tools .",
    "an important classical result , the knot complement theorem of gordon ",
    "luecke @xcite , asserts that if @xmath7 is obtained by a non - trivial surgery on a knot @xmath8 , then @xmath9 is an unknot .",

    "bennequin number , give some immediate easy results for legendrian knot surgeries ( see section [ tb ] ) .",
    "further , one expects that there are additional obstructions for surgeries between tight contact structures .",
    "tight lens spaces are the easiest example because they have a complete classification , are all stein fillable , and have simplest possible heegaard floer homology . using heegaard floer contact invariants , we get    [ hflo ] no tight contact structure on @xmath10",

    "note that theorem [ hflo ] does not contain any information about the existence of topological surgery . in some cases , an integral surgery between two lens spaces exists but ca nt be made into a legendrian surgery between tight contact structures ; in other cases , we can only claim that a legendrian surgery between tight lens spaces ca nt exist , and it is possible that there s no integral surgery whatsoever .",
    "( we give examples in section [ hfloer ] . )",
    "it is also useful to observe that for small lens spaces , one can rule out legendrian knot surgeries between tight contact structures simply by computing all of their 3-dimensional homotopy invariants .",
    "however , there are examples where theorem [ hflo ] gives an obstruction to the existence of legendrian surgery , but the homotopy invariants do nt .",
    "next , we turn attention to overtwisted manifolds . by @xcite , any contact manifold @xmath1 can be obtained from an overtwisted @xmath0 by a legendrian surgery on a link . a priori",
    ", this legendrian link may have more components than a smallest link in @xmath5 with an integral surgery producing @xmath4 .",

    "we establish a variety of other related results ( many of them mere observations ) in section [ otwist ] .",

    "the first way to find some obstructions for stein cobordisms between lens spaces is provided by examining stein fillings .",

    "we can state them for both the standard contact structures and their conjugates , since a stein filling @xmath38 of @xmath39 induces a stein filling @xmath40 of @xmath41 .",
    "we also recall that there are exactly two universally tight contact structures on @xmath42 : @xmath43 and its conjugate .",
    "the proposition below holds because otherwise there would be non - standard fillings ( with the second betti number not allowed by the classification results above ) ; to construct these non - standard fillings in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , start with the fillings for @xmath16 that have no 1-handles .",

    "in fact , part ( 2 ) can be extended : in a joint work with jeremy van horn - morris @xcite we show that every virtually overtwisted tight contact structure on @xmath6 has a unique filling ; it then follows that _ any _ tight @xmath42 can be obtained only from @xmath26 .",
    "we now establish the main result of this section .",
    "[ planar ] let @xmath39 be a stein fillable contact manifold that admits a compatible planar open book decomposition",

    "we recall that all tight contact structures on lens spaces admit planar open books @xcite .",
    "thus , theorem [ self ] is an immediate corollary of theorem [ planar ] .",
    "we will use a theorem of wendl ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) as our key tool .",
    "wendl essentially proves that every stein filling of a contact structure with a planar open book decomposition admits ( after an `` enlargement '' of the symplectic structure ) a compatible positive allowable lefschetz fibration that induces the given open book on the boundary .",
    "topologically , this means that every stein filling is diffeomorphic to a lefschetz fibration that corresponds to the product of positive dehn twists in some factorization of the monodromy for a _ given _ open book .",
    "we show that this leads to an upper bound on betti numbers of fillings . indeed , suppose the page of the open book is a disk with @xmath19 holes , @xmath48 ; the monodromy @xmath49 is an an element of the mapping class group @xmath50 of the disk with @xmath19 holes .",
    "shrinking the holes and thinking of them as punctured points , we get a homomorphism @xmath51 into the pure braid group on @xmath19 strings .",
    "( denh twists around the holes become trivial in @xmath52 . )",
    "let @xmath53 be given by the algebraic crossing number of braids ; then @xmath54 will be an invariant of the monodromy of our open book . now , suppose that the monodromy @xmath49 is expressed as a product of positive dehn twists around some simple closed curves in @xmath55 .",
    "we can consider the number of punctures enclosed by each curve , since these are simple closed curves in the disk , so the complement of each has the `` inside '' and the `` outside '' component .",
    "observe that each dehn twist that encloses more than one puncture contributes positively to the algebraic crossing number @xmath56 of the corresponding pure braid ; this gives an upper bound on the number of such dehn twists .",
    "to find an upper bound on the number of dehn twists around the holes , pick a hole @xmath57 and consider a self - homeomorphism of the @xmath19-holed disk that exchanges the roles of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the previous argument now yields a bound on the number of dehn twists around the outer component of the boundary , i.e. around the hole @xmath57 .",
    "( the image of the monodromy in @xmath52 depends on the choice of the outer component , so we will get different bounds for different @xmath60 . )",
    "we now have a bound on the total number of positive dehn twists in decompositions of the monodromy , i.e. on the second betti number of fillings of the contact structure compatible with @xmath61 .    to complete the proof ,",
    "observe that if a contact manifold can be obtained from itself by some legendrian surgery , we could generate fillings with arbitary large @xmath62 by starting with an arbitary filling and adding multiple copies of the collection of 2-handles that has trivial effect on the contact boundary .",
    "the proof of theorem [ planar ] yields the following    [ bound ] if @xmath39 admits a planar open book , there is a number @xmath63 such that for any stein filling @xmath64 of @xmath39 , the bound @xmath65 holds .",
    "it is known @xcite that for lens spaces , the only true cosmetic dehn surgeries ( i.e. rational knot surgeries that preserve the oriented manifold ) are those that `` switch '' the roles of the solid tori in a genus 1 heegaard decomposition of the lens space .",
    "( more precisely , one of these solid tori in @xmath16 is reglued to produce @xmath66 with @xmath67 modulo @xmath14 . )",
    "one can easily check that these surgeries can never be integral ; thus the claim of theorem  [ self ] is moot for legendrian surgeries on _",
    "knots_.    we also state an obvious corollary of theorem [ self ] :    [ back ] if a legendrian surgery on a link in a tight @xmath68 produces a tight @xmath69 , then no legendrian surgery in @xmath69 can produce @xmath68 .",
    "in this section , we use the heegaard floer contact invariants @xcite to find obstructions to existence of a legendrian knot surgery between two tight lens spaces .",
    "we work with @xmath70 coefficients throughout .",
    "recall that the invariant @xmath71 is an element of @xmath72 for a contact 3-manifold @xmath39 ; if @xmath73 is stein - fillable , @xmath74 .",
    "( thus the contact invariant is non - zero for all tight lens spaces . )",

    "we can consider the map @xmath77 induced by the @xmath75 cobordism , as well as the map @xmath78 obtained by summing over all @xmath75 structures on @xmath79 .",

    "we will follow this strategy to prove theorem [ hflo ] .    to prove that certain maps associated to surgeries vanish , we will make use of the surgery exact triangle . recall that the exact triangle relates the heegaard floer homologies of a 3-manifold @xmath84 and the following surgeries . for a choice of longitude @xmath85 for a knot @xmath86 , let @xmath87 be the manifold obtained by the surgery that attaches the meridian of the surgery torus to @xmath85 ; for @xmath88 ,",

    "( the fact that the thurston  bennequin number of a knot can be increased in overtwisted contact structures is well - known ; in fact this can be achieved by taking connected sums with the boundary of the overtwisted disk , see @xcite .",
    "we included a contact surgery version of such construction for completeness of discussion . )",
    "observe that in this process we did not change the isotopy type of @xmath2 ( but have little control over the isotopy type of @xmath3 ) . to obtain a given overtwisted contact structure @xmath3 on @xmath4",
    ", we can apply a similar procedure for @xmath149 contact surgery on the knot dual to @xmath9 in @xmath1 .",
    "note that we can not hope to fix both @xmath2 and @xmath3 : suppose that @xmath4 is obtained from @xmath4 by a surgery on a knot , and observe that two arbitary homotopy classes of contact structures can not always be connected by a single handle attachment .",
    "( examples are easy to find on @xmath7 . )",
    "first consider @xmath7 with the overtwisted contact structure @xmath211 that has @xmath212 .",
    "there is a legendrian unknot with @xmath213 and @xmath214 : for example , we can stabilize the non - loose unknot with @xmath215 and @xmath216 to decrease @xmath167 and increase @xmath168 . from ( [ d3 ] ) , the legendrian surgery on this unknot @xmath217 results in a contact structure homotopic to @xmath211 ( and necessarily overtwisted , since @xmath218 ; but then the resulting contact structure is isotopic to @xmath211 . to find an unknot with @xmath213 and @xmath219 in any other overtwisted contact structure @xmath73 ,",
    "we represent @xmath73 as the connected sum of itself and the overtwisted contact structure on @xmath7 with @xmath220 ( as in proposition [ ot - sur ] and figure [ overtwist ] ) , and then find a copy of the required unknot in the @xmath162 part of the contact structure .",
    "suppose that @xmath9 is a legendrian knot in @xmath0 such that @xmath223 contact surgery on @xmath9 produces @xmath1 .",
    "if we stabilize @xmath9 twice , the same integral surgery becomes a + 1 contact surgery and results in @xmath4 with a different contact structure @xmath221 .",
    "by @xcite , a + 1 surgery on a stabilized legendrian knot always yields an overtwisted contact structure .",
    "thus @xmath221 will be overtwisted ; cancelling the + 1 surgery by a legendrian surgery , we recover @xmath0 .",
    "if some contact structure on @xmath4 can be obtained from a tight contact @xmath5 , then the same tight contact structure on @xmath5 can be obtained by a single legendrian surgery from an overtwisted contact structure on @xmath4 .",

    "we conclude with a slightly more interesting example : legendrian surgeries between various contact structures on @xmath7 and @xmath225 .",
    "recall by @xcite there are only three tight contact structures on @xmath226 , and they are given by legendrian surgeries depicted in figure [ l74 ] .",
    "the values of the @xmath152-invariant can be computed to be 0 for the contact structure @xmath227 given by the more symmetric surgery diagram , and @xmath228 for the other two contact structures @xmath229 .",
    "although @xmath232 can be obtained from @xmath26 , the contact manifolds @xmath233 and @xmath234 can not be obtained by a surgery on legendrian knot from any contact structure on @xmath7 , tight or overtwisted .",
    "first , by @xcite we know that the integral surgery that can produce @xmath226 from @xmath7 has to be @xmath235 surgery on the left - handed trefoil .",
    "if we start with a tight @xmath7 , there is a unique legendrian left - handed trefoil with @xmath236 ( by the classification of legendrian torus knots @xcite ) .",
    "this trefoil has @xmath237 , so the legendrian surgery produces @xmath232 .",
    "if we want to produce the contact structure @xmath230 or @xmath231 from an overtwisted @xmath7 , we need to look for a non - loose left - handed trefoil with @xmath236 .",
    "notice that for such a knot , the thurston ",
    "bennequin bound will be satisfied : indeed , @xmath210 and @xmath238 of a null - homologous non - loose knot are restricted by the inequality @xmath239 ( see @xcite , proposition 5.3 in the arxiv version ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath240 . to pin down the value of @xmath168 , notice that siince contact structures on @xmath7 have half - integer values of @xmath152 , by ( [ d3 ] ) and ( [ c1rot ] ) we have @xmath241 for some integer @xmath19",
    "thus , @xmath242 is an integer , @xmath243 , and then @xmath244 , @xmath245 .",
    "this means that a legendrian surgery in @xmath7 can produce @xmath233 or @xmath246 only if @xmath7 is equipped with the contact structure @xmath247 with @xmath248 .",
    "our next claim is that the contact structure @xmath247 on @xmath7 in this case would have to be tight rather than overtwisted .",
    "( this leads to a contradiction , proving the proposition . ) indeed , for @xmath249 or @xmath231 , we show that heegaard floer contact invariant is non - zero for the contact structure obtained from @xmath250 by a @xmath149 contact surgery on the knot dual to the left - handed trefoil .",
