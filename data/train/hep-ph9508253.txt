    "the much heralded convergence of the standard model gauge couplings in supersymmetric grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite , is continually being challenged by ever more precise lep measurements of the gauge couplings .",
    "it was realized early on that the effect of the gut particles responsible for the onset of the unified theory , was not negligible @xcite .",
    "however , because of the presumed great uncertainty in the gut physics , such discussions have been largely carried out in the context of the minimal @xmath0 supergravity model @xcite .",
    "central to the study of these issues is the technical point of how exactly these gut ( or lighter ) particles decouple at scales below their masses .",
    "recent investigations @xcite reveal that a  smooth \" decoupling of particles leads to noticeable differences from the step - function approximation .",
    "moreover , these new effects coupled with the latest lep data on @xmath13 and the determination of the top - quark mass , lead to a greatly increased prediction for @xmath1 @xcite , strongly suggesting that minimal @xmath0 gut thresholds are unable to bring the @xmath1 prediction down to the experimentally acceptable range @xcite . this impasse may be resolved with a significant contribution from planck - scale non - renormalizable operators @xcite , although such effects call into question the whole field - theoretical approximation to the gauge coupling unification problem .",
    "even if planck - scale physics can resolve the present @xmath14 discrepancy in minimal @xmath0 , this gut model suffers from a well known fine - tuning @xcite regarding the solution of the doublet - triplet splitting problem of the higgs pentaplets .",
    "at least three solutions to this problem ( all involving non - minimal gut models ) have been proposed : the missing - partner mechanism @xcite , the sliding - singlet mechanism @xcite , and the pseudo - goldstone - boson mechanism @xcite . in the sliding - singlet mechanism",
    "radiative corrections destroy the gauge hierarchy @xcite , whereas an additional global or local @xmath15 symmetry is required in the pseudo - goldstone - boson mechanism .",
    "it is very suggestive that the same investigations that uncover the @xmath14 discrepancy in minimal @xmath0 , also show that in the so - called missing doublet model ( mdm ) @xcite , which has as its central component the missing - partner mechanism , the @xmath14 prediction is decreased to acceptable values @xcite .",
    "as we discuss below , some variants of the missing - doublet model @xcite also solve the problematic situation with dimension - five proton decay operators in minimal @xmath0 , which require the higgs triplet mass ( @xmath16 ) to exceed the gut scale and the supersymmetric spectrum to be tuned in specific ways @xcite , especially when cosmological constraints are simultaneously enforced @xcite .",
    "in fact , an updated analysis has recently shown @xcite that the upper bound on the higgs triplet mass from unification constraints ( , @xmath17 ) , and the corresponding lower bound from proton decay constraints ( , @xmath18 ) are very close to each other , leaving only a small window of allowed parameter space in minimal @xmath0 .",
    "note also that , because of the rather large representations introduced in the mdm ( , , ) , it is necessary to assign some of these planck - size masses , in order to avoid the onset of a strongly - interacting gut below the planck scale @xcite .",

    "@xmath19 guts @xcite have also received a great deal of attention lately @xcite , with interesting successes in the area of quark and lepton masses and mixings , although the @xmath20 prediction requires fine - tuning of the supersymmetric spectrum @xcite to reconcile it with radiative electroweak breaking .",
    "assuming universal soft supersymmetry breaking , the further constraints from @xmath21 and cosmology strongly disfavor the model @xcite .",

    "the first case implies an effective higgs - triplet mixing term of the same magnitude as in the minimal @xmath0 model , and therefore similar difficulties in suppressing proton decay .",

    "this could in principle happen if the non - renormalizable operators obtained when integrating out the right - handed neutrino fields , , @xmath230 , where @xmath175 is the lepton doublet in @xmath231 and @xmath232 the higgs doublet in @xmath25 , are in equilibrium with the sphaleron interactions @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that to prevent the erasure of the asymmetry , one must demand @xmath233 , which is always satisfied for our choices of @xmath177 and @xmath234 .",
    "the revamped mdm presented in the previous sections has several appealing phenomenological features , constituting an interesting example of traditional grand unified model building .",
    "nonetheless , it is apparent that the model is rather non - minimal or uneconomical .",
    "for instance , a needs to be used for gut symmetry breaking , greatly increasing the size of the gut particle spectrum . moreover , the , to effect the doublet - triplet splitting problem make the unified gauge coupling so large above the gut scale that they need to be taken at the gravitational scale",
    ". the doublet - triplet splitting is tamed , but proton decay can still be too fast because of the  useless \" pieces of the , representations which need to be made heavy , resulting in the otherwise - not - needed doubling of these representations and of the higgs pentaplets . regarding the right - handed neutrinos , their ( ad - hoc ) introduction has various desirable consequences . however , the yukawa matrix coupling them to the lepton doublets is arbitrary , with no particular motivation for its desired hierarchical structure .",
    "it is interesting to note that the above critique of the revamped mdm can be circumvented altogether if one extends the gauge group from @xmath0 to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "gauge symmetry breaking down to the standard model gauge group occurs via vacuum expectation values of the @xmath232 ( ) and @xmath235 ( ) higgs representations .",
    "this is possible because of the  flipping \" @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 involved in the assignment of the standard model particles to the @xmath240 ( ) and @xmath241 ( ) representations .",
    "thus , @xmath232 and @xmath235 contain one pair of neutral fields @xmath242 , which get vevs along the flat direction @xmath243 .",
    "there is no need for large gut representations for symmetry breaking . as is well known ( and we review below )",
    ", this property takes on a much larger magnitude when one attempts to derive these models in string model building .    the missing - partner mechanism , which above involved the couplings @xmath31 [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ] and @xmath32 [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ] , is now effected by the couplings @xmath244 [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ] and @xmath245 [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ] .",
    "first note that no additional representations are needed besides the gut - breaking higgs ones .",
    "moreover , the resulting higgs triplet matrix @xmath246 does not need a large non - zero ( 22 ) entry ( _ c.f . _ eq .",
    "( [ eq:2/3 ] ) ) because the  useless \" components of the @xmath232 and @xmath235 representations are eaten by the gut gauge bosons to become massive or become gut higgsinos .",
    "this natural zero mass term for @xmath247 implies that the dimension - five proton decay operators are negligible .",
    "we end up with a very economical gut higgs spectrum and no threat of dimension - five operators .",
    "regarding neutrino masses , the right - handed neutrinos which had to be introduced by hand in the revamped mdm , are now contained in the @xmath248 ( ) representations .",
    "indeed , the coupling @xmath249 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) is here written as @xmath250 , with the ( unavoidable ) right - handed electrons now introduced  by hand \" . in @xmath251",
    "this coupling provides the charged lepton masses . on the other hand , the coupling @xmath252 , which in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) provided the down - quark masses , here provides the up - quark masses and dirac neutrino masses .",
    "( also , the coupling @xmath253 , which in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) provided the up - quark masses , here provides the down - quark masses . ) thus , the right - handed neutrinos are unavoidable in @xmath6 , and their yukawa couplings to the lepton doublets are equal to those of the up - quark yukawa matrix , providing ( as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : cba ] ) an automatic and desirable hierarchy in the see - saw neutrino masses .",
    "an important distinction between the see - saw mechanism in the revamped mdm and @xmath6 is the manner in which the right - handed neutrinos get a mass . in the revamped mdm",
    "this is through the superpotential term @xmath254 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) , whereas in @xmath6 there are two possible sources : ( i ) through cubic couplings @xmath255 , where @xmath256 ( with @xmath257 ) are @xmath0 singlets @xcite ; and ( ii ) through non - renormalizable couplings @xmath258 @xcite .",
    "the second form resembles that in the revamped mdm , although the mass scale is likely higher ( , @xmath259 ) .",
    "these two models also differ somewhat in the calculation of the cosmic baryon asymmetry , besides the possible difference in the right - handed neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "indeed , because the @xmath6 gauge symmetry is broken along a flat direction , there is a dilution factor ( @xmath260 ) in the computation of the lepton asymmetry due to the entropy released by the late - decaying  flaton \" field @xcite .",
    "however , these two effects ( @xmath176 spectrum and @xmath260 ) tend to compensate each other and an acceptable baryon asymmetry is typically obtained @xcite .",
    "there is another cosmological aspect of these models that sets them apart , namely the breaking of the gut symmetry down to the standard model one . in the mdm , @xmath0 symmetry breaking via an arbitrary vev of the leads to several possible degenerate vacua @xcite , at least in the context of global supersymmetry .",
    "when supergravity effects are taken into account , if the desired vacuum has zero cosmological constant , all the others will be lower in energy , although essentially unreachable @xcite .",
    "thus , if the vev of the can be arranged to be in the desired direction , the universe will remain in the desired broken phase .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath6 the breaking down to the standard model via the vevs of the , along the f- and d - flat direction @xmath243 is _ unique _ @xcite .    regarding the issue of unification , the revamped mdm requires non - minimal representations to make this possible . in @xmath6",
    "traditional grand unification does not occur ( although the non - abelian standard model gauge groups do unify ) and unification is not a test of the model .",
    "however , if string unification is desired ( at the scale @xmath261 ) , then non - minimal representations need to be added to the @xmath6 model @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the pair of , representations in the revamped mdm need to be put at the gravitational scale .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether this model can be obtained from the only known consistent theory of quantum gravity , namely string theory . because of some technical difficulties which we review below",
    ", no attempts have been made to derive the mdm from strings .",
    "it is of course well known that @xmath6 can be easily derived from strings @xcite .",
    "the prime constraint in string model - building is that of the massless representations which are allowed when the corresponding gauge group @xmath262 is represented by a  level-@xmath263 \" kac - moody algebra on the world - sheet @xcite .",
    "the allowed representations must be unitary , @xmath264 where @xmath265 are the dynkin labels of the highest weight representation in question , and @xmath266 are fixed positive integers for a given @xmath262 . in the case of @xmath267 : @xmath268 . in our @xmath0 example then @xmath269 .",
    "looking up the @xmath265 values , we see that for @xmath270 , only , , , , are unitary . for @xmath271",
    "we find in addition : , , , , , , , , .",
    "only level - one constructions appear to be needed to derive @xmath6 , whereas at least level - two constructions are required in the mdm .",
    "however , this is not the end of the story , since one can also ask whether the allowed representations could possible be massless .",
    "this requires calculating the so - called conformal dimension @xmath272 of the representation @xmath273 , @xmath274 where @xmath275 is the casimir of @xmath273 , and @xmath276 that of the adjoint representation . if @xmath277 , the representation is necessarily massive .",
    "for @xmath278 the representation could be massless , although this is not guaranteed since other degrees of freedom may add their own contribution to the conformal dimension making it exceed unity .",
    "it is not hard to see that in @xmath0 all unitary representations at level one are also massless @xcite , and thus @xmath6 models can be readily constructed at level one .",
    "the unitary representations of interest for mdm model - building , which are allowed at level two , have conformal dimensions @xmath279 and are not massless at level two .",
    "in fact , @xmath280 is required to make all these representations massless .",
    "such high - level kac - moody constructions have never been attempted .",
    "one intriguing possibility would be to construct level - two @xmath0 string models ( for recent attempts see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which should allow the required large mdm representations , although with masses at the planck scale . note that this is not necessarily a problem since we already require the , to be at that mass scale .",
    "if the is also raised to that scale , the breaking of @xmath0 would occur at the string scale , and this may be difficult to reconcile with gauge coupling unification .",
    "it is also worth remarking that in a string model all gauge couplings are related at the string scale , and with @xmath0 constructed at level two , the relation would be @xmath281 @xcite , where @xmath282 is the gauge coupling of the hidden gauge group . finally , the mass terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : w],[eq : w ] ) , which would not be allowed if the large mdm representations belonged to the massless spectrum , are expected to arise when they belong to the string massive spectrum .",
    "of course , bridging the gap between the massless and massive spectrum may create problems in obtaining the low - energy effective field theory , but this question can not be answered until an actual model is constructed along these lines .",
    "during the last few years , a great deal of attention has been paid to supersymmetric grand unified theories in light of the precise lep measurements of the standard model gauge couplings .",
    "these analyses depend crucially on the details of the low - energy supersymmetric spectrum and the heavy gut spectrum .",
    "most of the effort to date has been focused on the minimal @xmath0 supergravity model , which appears to be running into difficulties regarding unification and proton decay .",
    "in addition , there is the nagging doublet - triplet splitting problem that receives no satisfactory explanation .",
    "motivated by these developments , we have reconsidered one of the alternatives to minimal @xmath0 , where the doublet - triplet splitting is dealt with in a reasonable way via the missing - partner mechanism , and gauge coupling unification is not in jeopardy .",
    "we have revamped this model to tame the dimension - five proton decay operators , and to allow see - saw neutrino masses . in order to generate the needed intermediate scale for the right - handed neutrino masses ,",
    "we have endowed the model with a  modern \" hidden sector which can generate dynamically the desired intermediate scale , the scale of supersymmetry breaking , and the higgs mixing parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the revamped mdm also provides for the cosmic baryon asymmetry through the fukugita - yanagida mechanism via lepton - number - violating decays of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we have also contrasted the main features of the revamped mdm against the  flipped \" @xmath6 model , and basically shown that the former can be considered as a  poor man s \" version of the latter . in the realm of string model - building , @xmath6 fares rather well , whereas the revamped mdm is very unlikely to be realized , except perhaps if one allows @xmath0 symmetry breaking to occur at the string scale .",
