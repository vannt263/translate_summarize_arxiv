    "numerous independent surveys have demonstrated evidence on both cosmological and galactic scales that about 30% of the matter energy density of the universe consists of non - baryonic , non - luminous matter . a leading candidate for this dark matter",
    "is a yet - to - be - discovered weakly interactive massive particle ( wimp ) which could directly interact with detectors based on earth leading to kev - scale nuclear recoils .",
    "direct dark matter detection experiments are now probing well - motivated models of extensions to the standard model such as supersymmetry which naturally predict dark matter candidates  @xcite .    as the exposures of direct dark matter detection experiments continue to improve , they will soon have enough sensitivity to detect neutrinos from several astrophysical sources such as the sun , the atmosphere , and diffuse supernovae @xcite .",
    "for example , a 1  kev threshold xe based experiment with a 1  ton - year exposure will detect about 100 @xmath1 solar neutrino events via coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering ( cns ) .",
    "in fact for some wimp masses , such neutrino backgrounds can almost perfectly mimic a wimp signal .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the cns background leads to a strong reduction of the discovery potential of upcoming experiments . therefore , though neither coherent neutrino scattering nor the wimp - nucleus interaction have conclusively been observed yet , the search for discrimination methods to disentangle wimps from neutrino events is a necessity .",
    "several methods to improve on the discrimination power between a wimp and a neutrino origin of the observed nuclear recoils have been suggested  @xcite , including using the annual modulation signal  @xcite or directional detection methods  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new method to reduce the effect of this neutrino background by looking for a possible complementarity between different target nuclei .",
    "in addition to discussing the target complementarity for different spin - independent ( si ) targets , for the first time we discuss the prospects for complementarity using spin - dependent ( sd ) targets .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : neutfloor ] , we briefly review how to compute the wimp and neutrino event rates and we explain the test statistic that has been used to generate discovery limits .",
    "we then compute some discovery limits for several upcoming direct dark matter detection experiments in light of the neutrino background . in sec .",
    "[ sec : beyond ] , we show how target complementarity can help on improving the wimp discovery potential by considering both si and sd interactions .",
    "we then illustrate the improvement on the discovery limits by combining data from different targets . in sec .",
    "[ sec : optimization ] , we explore how one can optimize the relative exposures of the different target materials in a given experiment in order to maximize its discovery potential using the effect of target complementarity .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     interestingly , from figs .",
    "[ fig : evolution_sys ] and [ fig : evolution_mass ] we can clearly see that the neutrino background will impact the low wimp mass ( below 10 gev / c@xmath0 ) and the high wimp mass ( above 10 gev / c@xmath0 ) regions at very different exposures due to the vastly different rates of neutrino backgrounds seen in fig  [ fig : eventrate ] .",
    "indeed , the discovery limit evolution with exposure transitions from 1/mt to 1/@xmath2 as soon as the expected neutrino background nears 1 event , which corresponds to exposures of a few kg - years for very - low - threshold experiments in the low - mass region and a few tens of ton - years for the high - mass region for idealized perfect - efficiency experiments ( actual exposure values depend on the target , threshold , and efficiency of a given experiment ) .",
    "the saturation regime exists for exposures between 100 kg - year and 10 ton - year and between 10@xmath3 ton - year and 10@xmath4 ton - year for the low and high wimp mass regions respectively .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that the next generation of low - threshold experiments focusing on the low wimp mass region could reach well into the @xmath5 regime and even begin to see the effects of saturation , while at high wimp masses the next generation of experiments will at most begin to see the 1/@xmath2 effects from the neutrino background .      from fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution_sys ] and [ fig : evolution_mass ] , we have seen that the neutrino background can lead to a saturation regime of the discovery potential over certain mass ranges that can span over 2 orders of magnitude in exposure .",
    "however , with enough exposure or lower systematics , one can always improve the discovery limit . in the following , we will define an arbitrary neutrino induced discovery limit within the saturation regime , derived from a set of two different exposures ( and energy thresholds ) for the low and high wimp mass regimes .",
    "the thresholds are defined such that for the low mass region we expect no @xmath6 neutrino events in the data and that for the high mass region we expect no @xmath1 neutrinos events in the data .",
    "the exposures are set such that the low wimp mass regime detects 200 events from @xmath1 ( about 1660 neutrino events total including pep , hep and @xmath7 ) , and the high wimp mass regime detects 400 neutrino events .",
    "the corresponding exposures and thresholds for each target discussed in the following are summarized in table  [ tab : exposures ] .",
    "one can then see , using figure [ fig : evolution_sys ] , that the computed limits are always within the saturation regime of the discovery potential for both the low and the high wimp mass regions .",
    "as previously discussed , this is where adding a new observable such as annual modulation  @xcite and/or directionality  @xcite , or combining data from several experiments , as suggested in sec .",
    "[ sec : beyond ] , can lead to the most substantial improvement in the discovery potential .",
    "figure [ fig : discovery_limit_si ] , [ fig : discovery_limit_sdp ] and [ fig : discovery_limit_sdn ] show the computed limits for single - target and multi - target - based experiments for both si and sd interactions using the target and neutrino properties shown in tables [ tab : nuclei ] and [ tab : neutrino ] , and the energy thresholds and exposures from table  [ tab : exposures ] .",
    "it should be noted that these are limits calculated for idealized experiments with perfect efficiency , and no background except for neutrinos , and thus represent the best attainable discovery limit for the listed exposures .    in figure",
    "[ fig : discovery_limit_si ] ( left panel ) we show the discovery limits of elemental targets considering only the si interaction .",
    "one can first notice that , using a binned likelihood function , we have been able to reproduce the results from @xcite . in the si case",
    "the equivalent wimp models corresponding to a given neutrino type are only weakly dependent on the considered target ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : beyond ] for more details ) , thus all single - nucleus based targets share a very similar discovery limit .    on figure [ fig : discovery_limit_si ] (",
    "right panel ) we show the discovery limits for the si interaction considering compound targets such as @xmath8 ( used in cresst ) , @xmath9 ( used in coupp ) , and @xmath10 ( used in pico and picasso ) .",
    "since experiments that use @xmath10 and @xmath9 do nt currently measure the recoil energy of the event , we computed limits with and without energy sensitivity , shown as dashed and solid lines respectively . in the case of compound targets ,",
    "we chose the thresholds by considering the lightest nucleus of the mixture as it has its neutrino spectra the most shifted to the high recoil energies . for example , considering @xmath8 , in order to compute the low threshold part of the discovery limit , we chose a threshold such that there is no pp neutrino events in the data due to the o target , _ i.e _ 25  ev . by choosing this threshold we do not consider the same event rate proportions for the three different targets .",
    "this explains the three successive exponential - like falls from a wimp mass of @xmath11 to about @xmath12 for this target .",
    "we can apply the same reasoning for the @xmath9 target where we can see two different exponential - like falls due to i and f targets . for @xmath10",
    "this effect is not visible as f and c have very similar atomic masses .",
    "note that the discovery limit for cf@xmath13 ( used in experiments such as mimac  @xcite and dmtpc  @xcite ) is almost identical to the one from a c@xmath14f@xmath15 based experiment with energy sensitivity .",
    "therefore , all the following results using @xmath10 are also relevant to cf@xmath13 .",
    "figures  [ fig : discovery_limit_sdp ] and [ fig : discovery_limit_sdn ] show the discovery limits considering a sd interaction on the proton and on the neutron , respectively .",
    "these discovery limits have similar shapes to those derived for the si interaction but their relative amplitudes can be very different . for example , considering a sd interaction on the proton , a si - based experiment and an experiment using @xmath10 have their discovery limits around @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the low mass region , respectively .",
    "this difference is due to the nature of the sd interaction .",
    "indeed , the neutrino - nucleus cross section is still described by a coherent effect ( evolution in @xmath18 ) while the sd wimp - nucleus cross section depends on the total angular momentum and mean spin contents of the considered target ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : sigsd ] and table [ tab : nuclei ] ) .",
    "another interesting feature that one can notice from figures [ fig : discovery_limit_sdp ] and [ fig : discovery_limit_sdn ] concerns the multi - target based experiments . indeed , for such experiments",
    ", some nuclei from the target material can not lead to a sd interaction as they have @xmath19 .",
    "this effect leads to different shapes in the discovery limits between the si and sd cases , as one can see for @xmath10 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "one may also notice that @xmath8 does not appear on figures [ fig : discovery_limit_sdp ] and [ fig : discovery_limit_sdn ] as it has no sd sensitivity .",
    "for these six figures , the discovery limit indicates the region of parameter space where the neutrino background has its highest impact on the reach of upcoming direct detection experiments . indeed , with the considered energy thresholds and exposures , the discovery potential is in the saturation regime over most of the mass range , where a slight increase in sensitivity would be at the cost of a large increase in exposure .",
    "this clearly highlights the need for developing alternative strategies to be able to probe dark matter models lying underneath this neutrino - induced bound on the wimp discovery reach .",
    "as shown in the previous section , it can be extremely difficult to claim a discovery of dark matter if the true wimp model lies below the neutrino background .",
    "however , there are several possible ways to improve the discovery potential , even in the neutrino - induced saturation regime .",
    "the first one is to improve the theoretical estimates and experimental measurements of neutrino fluxes as it has been shown in figure [ fig : evolution_sys ] .",
    "a second possibility is to add some new observables that could help at disentangling between the wimp and neutrino origin of the observed nuclear recoils .",
    "this could be done by searching for annual modulation  @xcite and/or by measuring the nuclear recoil direction  @xcite , as suggested by upcoming directional detection experiments @xcite .",
    "indeed , since the main neutrino background has a solar origin , the directional signature of such events is expected to be drastically different from the wimp induced one @xcite .",
    "we are now in position to study the gains in discovery potential that can be achieved by combining data from different target materials in light of the neutrino background .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the effect of neutrino background is notably important at particular wimp masses and cross sections where the wimp and neutrino spectra are similar , both in shape and magnitude .",
    "the wimp mass and cross section where this occurs is target - material dependent .",
    "one may then wonder whether combining different experiments could alleviate such degeneracies between the wimp and the neutrino hypotheses .    in order to investigate this possibility , we determine what wimp models can be mimicked by @xmath22b neutrinos by computing the maximum likelihood distributions under the wimp only hypothesis in the ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) plane from fake data containing only nuclear recoils from @xmath22b neutrinos . because of the small differences between the wimp and neutrino energy distributions , the reconstructed wimp masses for each target are slightly different .",
    "this is result shown in figure [ fig : complementarity ] ( left panel ) . for a si interaction , the reconstructed cross sections for different targets are all roughly the same as is shown on figure [ fig : complementarity ] ( right panel ) .",
    "this is because both neutrino- and wimp - nucleus cross sections evolve as @xmath25 ( eq . [ eq : sigsi ] ) .",
    "therefore , we expect the target complementarity in the si case to be fairly weak",
    ".    however , for a sd interaction the situation is different . as figure  [ fig : complementarity ]",
    "( right panel ) clearly indicates , the reconstructed cross sections for the different targets can be different by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this is due to the nature of the wimp sd cross section which depends on the angular momentum ( @xmath26 ) , spin content ( @xmath27 ) and isotopic fractions ( @xmath28 ) of the considered targets ( eq . [ eq : sigsd ] ) .",
    "thus , as the reconstructed wimp models of a given neutrino for different target nuclei are strongly distinguishable , one could expect to gain in discrimination power between the wimp and the neutrino hypothesis by combining data from several experiments . as a matter of fact ,",
    "figure  [ fig : complementarity ] ( right panel ) can be seen as a way to quantify the target complementarity . indeed ,",
    "the larger the difference in reconstructed wimp cross sections between two targets is , the greater the discrimination power and improvement in a combined discovery potential becomes .        as mentioned above , target complementarity is not very efficient for the si interaction as one can see on figure  [ fig : complementarity_si ] ( left ) where we have computed the discovery limits ( solid curves ) for progressive combinations of xe , ge , si , and @xmath10 targets using thresholds taken from table  [ tab : exposures ] for the low wimp mass region .",
    "the exposures for each individual target have been set such that we expect a total of 1,000 @xmath1 neutrino events equally distributed amongst each experiment .",
    "for example , the xe+ge curve has exposures set such that 500 events are detected in xe and 500 in ge .",
    "the slight shift to higher wimp masses when adding si to the xe+ge mixture comes from the differences in the reconstructed wimp masses from a @xmath22b signal shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : complementarity ] ( left panel ) .",
    "@xmath10 is currently used in bubble chamber experiments such as coupp which do not have sensitivity to the recoil energy since they detect events which deposit an energy density above the threshold required to generate bubble nucleation @xcite .",
    "we have thus included curves with and without energy sensitivity for this target . for reference ,",
    "the background - free sensitivity limits for the chosen exposures are also shown as dashed lines .",
    "the ratio between the sensitivity and the discovery limits , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : complementarity_si ] ( right panel ) , allows us to quantify the impact of the neutrino background on the wimp discovery potential of these idealized experiments . as expected , for si wimp interactions target complementarity has a modest effect and can at most reduce by a factor of 2 the impact of the neutrino background on the discovery potential .",
    "[ fig : complementarity_sdp ] ( left panel ) is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : complementarity_si ] ( left panel ) but for the sd interaction on the proton .",
    "from fig .",
    "[ fig : complementarity ] ( right ) we see that fluorine targets have a large advantage in sensitivity for sd proton interactions .",
    "one can see this in the large improvement in discovery potential when adding @xmath10 to the compliment of targets .",
    "one might wonder if it is worth combining @xmath10 with other experiments due to its advantage for this interaction . to consider this",
    ", we have added a @xmath10-only discovery and sensitivity limit .",
    "one can see that even though one obtains the best background - free sensitivity with @xmath10 , the best discovery limit is obtained by adding other targets which helps at reducing the effect of the neutrino background by about an order of magnitude ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : complementarity_sdp ] right panel ) even while the background - free sensitivity is reduced .",
    "it is also worth recalling that the curves that consider an experiment using @xmath10 with recoil energy sensitivity have very similar neutrino background implications than cf@xmath13-based experiments such as mimac and dmtpc .",
    "finally fig .",
    "[ fig : complementarity_sdn ] shows the results of complimentarity for the sd neutron case . for this interaction ,",
    "the improvement in discovery potential is intermediate between the si and sd proton case .    while we have considered only models in which a wimp has one of these three types of nuclear interactions , a true wimp may have non - zero cross sections in all three of these channels .",
    "if a potential signal is discovered near the neutrino - induced discovery limit , a more detailed scan of the parameter space would be required to disentangle the possible wimp and neutrino signals .      in the previous section",
    ", we focused on the effect of target complementarity on the discovery potential of upcoming experiments for a fixed exposure . in the following",
    ", we will describe the effect of target complementarity on the dynamics of the discovery limit when increasing the exposure around the saturation regime .",
    "+ figure [ fig : evolution ] shows the evolution of the discovery limit for xe ( red  @xmath29 ) , xe+ge ( blue  @xmath30 ) and xe+ge+si ( green  @xmath31 ) based experiments considering both si ( left panel ) and sd ( right panel ) interactions for a @xmath11 wimp mass .",
    "we can see that in the case of a si interaction , combining xe , ge and si does not allow one to greatly improve on its discovery potential .",
    "the green points ( xe+ge+si ) still clearly show a saturation regime in the discovery potential .",
    "however , considering a sd interaction on the proton , adding successively ge and si allows one to consequently improve the evolution of the discovery potential with exposure and keep it close to the @xmath5 best - case scenario . by comparing the xe - only and xe+ge+si points",
    ", we can see that target complementarity allows one to reach a discovery limit of about @xmath32 with an exposure which is 50 times lower .",
    "this clearly highlights the interest of combining data from different experiments to bypass the saturation regime induced by the neutrino background .",
    "we considered both the si and the sd interaction on the proton . for the si interaction",
    "there is no optimal si fraction because there is no visible effect from target complementarity .",
    "however , for the sd interaction on the proton , the discovery limit at @xmath11 has a minimum value for a certain si fraction which depends on the considered exposure . ]",
    "the previous results have shown combinations of several single - nucleus based experiments with a fixed relative exposure . in this section",
    ", we will address the optimization of several target materials when designing a future experiment that would maximize its discovery potential .",
    "we will consider the relative exposures of si and ge crystals in this example since at least one experiment ( supercdms ) can use both of these targets in their future payloads .    as suggested by our previous study of the target complementarity , in the context of a si interaction",
    "the discovery limit is only slightly affected by changing the si fraction of the total exposure .",
    "we thus concentrate on the sd proton interaction .",
    "figure  [ fig : optimization ] shows the discovery limit for a combination of ge and si - based experiments as a function of the considered si fraction in the total exposure at a fixed wimp mass of 6 gev / c@xmath0 .",
    "the considered thresholds for the two experiments target nuclei are taken from table  [ tab : exposures ] .",
    "we can see that for exposures which are low enough to be in the systematics - dominated regime ( below 0.2 ton - year ) , adding si in the experiment does not improve the discovery potential because the reconstructed cross section for si is about two orders of magnitude higher than the one for ge ( see fig.[fig : complementarity ] ) .",
    "however , when the exposure is high enough to be in the discovery potential saturation regime , the complementarity of the two targets leads to an improvement of the combined discovery potential .",
    "the optimum si fraction that maximizes the effect of the complementarity of ge and si corresponds to the minimum of these curves which has been marked by a `` @xmath31 '' .",
    "we can therefore see that as the exposure increases , the si fraction that maximizes the discovery potential has to be higher . for a 0.4  ton - year experiment it is around 30% but for a 10  ton - year experiment",
    "it is around 60% .",
    "[ fig : optimization ] suggests that for very high exposures , it is worth tuning the relative exposures of ge and si detectors in order to maximize the discovery potential in light of the neutrino background .",
    "since dark matter experiments will soon begin be sensitive to coherent neutrino scattering from solar neutrinos , the search for discrimination methods to disentangle wimp from neutrino events is a necessity . for both spin - independent and spin - dependent targets ,",
    "we have examined the effect of target complementarity on the discovery potential of single nucleus and multi - target based experiments . in general , we find that combining different targets such as xe and ge will allow for an improvement in the discovery potential . for spin - independent interactions , we show that the similarity between the scaling of the response of wimps and neutrinos with different targets ultimately limits the gain in discovery potential achievable .",
    "however , this situation is different for spin - dependent interactions . in this case",
    ", the differences in the cross sections of wimps and neutrinos with different targets allows one to bypass the saturation of the discovery potential and allow the search for dark matter to be pursued to lower cross sections .",
    "the improvement is most dramatic for spin - dependent wimp - proton interactions . in particular combining c@xmath14f@xmath15 with other targets results in a significant decrease of the impact of the neutrino background on the discovery potential .",
    "we have also shown that the effect of target complementarity can be used to optimize the different element fractions for experiments which have more than one target material .",
    "in particular for the sd interaction on the proton , there is an optimum si fraction for a ge@xmath29si experiment which maximizes the discovery potential .",
    "we have discussed how this fraction depends on the exposure and increases with the exposure .    in summary ,",
    "the results that we have presented in this paper provide valuable input for future direct dark matter searches .",
    "we have provided the first suggestion for expanding the reach of wimp dark matter searches in the regime where the neutrino backgrounds are substantial .",
    "the methods we have discussed rely only on measuring energy depositions , and can ultimately be complementary to methods that reduce the neutrino background that rely on different experimental signatures such as annual modulation or the direction of the recoiling nucleus . + * acknowledgments* les was supported by nsf grant phy-1417457 .",
