    "why only the left - handed fermions can feel weak interaction , while the right - handed fermions ca nt , is a long - standing fundamental question in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "basically speaking there are two category models to solve this issue .",
    "the first ones are the so - called left - right symmetric models , in which the su(2 ) singlet right - handed fermions in the sm are assumed to involve the new gauge interaction .",
    "many models of this kind have been constructed based on the minimal gauge group @xmath9 since the seventies in the last century @xcite .",
    "the second ones are mirror models , in which the usual sm fermions and/or gauge boson are accompanied by the mirror partners , similar to the case in the supersymmetric models .",
    "this idea was first proposed by lee and yang in 1956 @xcite .",
    "based on this naive conjecture , many models were constructed .",
    "an excellent extensive review on this subject can be found in ref .",
    "one of the advantages of the left - right symmetric models is that parity can be restored at higher energy .",
    "however the parity restoration scale has been pushed higher and higher , namely up to several tevs because of severe constraints from the precise measurements of the low energy experiments , for example from the measurement of @xmath10 mixing .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the mirror models . besides providing a way to understand parity restoration , the mirror particles in the mirror models can provide _ natural _ candidates for the dark matter .",
    "it is well known that the sm can provide an excellent description for particle experiments at energies so far probed .",
    "but it can not give any explanation for dark matter .",
    "thus people expect that new physics beyond the sm can provide a natural candidate for the dark matter . at present , the most popular candidate for the ( thermal - produced ) dark matter is the so - called weakly - interacting - massive - particle ( wimp ) .",
    "there are some popular candidates for wimps , for example lightest supersymmetric particle(lsp ) , axion and lightest kaluza - klein particle ( lkp ) in universal extra dimension models etc .",
    "however the new observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies seem indicate that non - cold dark matter ( e.g. sterile neutrino ) needs to be considered seriously @xcite .",
    "mirror models @xcite can also give this kind of candidate for dark matter .",
    "besides the cosmological evidences , we need also inputs from collider experiments , for example the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and international linear collider(ilc ) , in order to reach the decisive conclusions on the properties of dark matter .",
    "the basic assumption here is that the dark matter should couple to usual sm matter . in mirror models mirror particles",
    "can couple to ordinary particles through three kinds of renormalizable gauge invariant interactions .",
    "the first possibility is through neutrino mixing if the sm right - handed neutrino , as well as the corresponding mirror fields , are introduced .",
    "if neutrinos have masses , then the mixing between ordinary and mirror neutrinos is possible .",
    "the discussion of this possibility can be found in ref .",
    "the other two possibilities are kinetic mixing and scalar mixing , expressed as @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 the mirror fields of usual u(1 ) gauge and higgs fields respectively in the sm . in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , @xmath14 will give electric charge to mirror quarks and leptons . because qed has been tested very precisely , the mixing parameter @xmath15 is severely constrained to be extremely small @xcite , which should play a negligible role at lhc and ilc .",
    "the same conclusion applies also to the neutrino mixing case .",
    "thus in this paper we will concentrate on the third possibility : scalar mixing .    as indicated in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , mirror higgs @xmath13 can couple to ordinary sm higgs @xmath16 through renormalizable gauge invariant term @xmath17 with @xmath18 the dimensionless free parameter .",
    "after electroweak symmetry spontaneously breaking , there remain two physical higgs bosons .",
    "each higgs boson is the mixture state of sm and mirror higgs fields . as a consequence",
    ", each higgs boson will couple to both usual sm and mirror particles . so",
    "our primary interest in this paper is to investigate the mirror particle effects on the higgs sector .",
    "the generic feature of higgs boson is that higgs boson can decay invisibly , i.e. into mirror particles .",
    "such invisible decay can be searched in all production modes @xcite , and the promising ones are associated production with z boson @xmath19 , or through gauge boson fusion processes @xmath20 , as well as associated production with top quark pairs etc .    in this paper",
    "we will focus on a new mode to search for the higgs boson invisible decay at lhc , i.e. @xmath21 . here h and @xmath2 are the heavier and lighter higgs boson in mirror model ( see section ii ) .",
    "the mirror particles will appear as the missing energy in the detectors .",
    "the advantage of this process is that light h can be produced copiously due to the gluon - gluon high luminosity .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath22 is required to be larger than @xmath23 in order to obtain large production rate .",
    "as shown below ( section iii ) , @xmath24 is allowed in the mirror model after imposing the constraints from electro - weak precision observable . in the mirror model ,",
    "the coupling strength of h - h - h is proportional to @xmath25 ( section ii ) , and the partial decay width of the mode @xmath26 can be even larger than those that into gauge bosons . thus this process can be a promising channel to study the mirror model . in this paper",
    "we will also study the signals and backgrounds for the process @xmath27 .",
    "our study shows that it is * a challenge * to observe this process due to the huge qcd backgrounds .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in section",
    "ii we briefly describe the mirror model , and work out the higgs boson spectrum and interactions . in section iii",
    "we investigate the constraints from electro - weak precision observables utilizing the s , t parametrization .",
    "in section iv we show the main results for the higgs boson decays and main production channels .",
    "section v contains the detail simulation for the signals and backgrounds for the process @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the last section is allocated to discussions and conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the mirror model ( for full details to see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the quantum field theory",
    ", the usual parity translation takes @xmath30 to @xmath31 and @xmath32 to @xmath32 . in the left - right symmetric models parity",
    "is extended to a new type @xmath33 discrete symmetry which transforms the left - handed field to the right - handed one for the _ same _ fermion . besides fermion sector , under such @xmath33",
    "the sm @xmath34 weak gauge boson fields transform to the new @xmath35 gauge bosons and vice versa .",
    "however such discrete symmetry is not solely fixed . under @xmath33 ,",
    "the left - handed sector of fermion field can transform to the right - handed sector of _ different _ fermion field , namely the mirror fermion field .",
    "based on this observation , one can extend the sm by doubling the ordinary fermion , gauge and higgs fields @xcite .",
    "thus the new mirror fermions are natural singlets of the sm gauge group , and they ( nucleus if there exists mirror @xmath36 ) can be the candidates for the dark matter .",
    "the minimal gauge group of the new mirror model is @xmath37 .",
    "the gauge quantum numbers under @xmath38 for the usual and mirror fermion fields are @xmath39 with @xmath40 the family index .",
    "the @xmath33 parity symmetry that we define now is @xmath41    one of the advantages of this model , as we discussed above , is that there are natural candidates of non - baryonic dark matter in addition to restore parity @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that this model does not contradict with the astrophysical and cosmological observations .    in the following we focus on the higgs sector of this mirror model .",
    "there are two higgs fields @xmath16 and @xmath13 , which are doublets under @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "one assumes that the higgs potential is invariant under the discrete symmetry @xmath44 to keep the parity in a broader sense .",
    "the higgs potential is very simply given by @xmath45    after electro - weak symmetry breaking , the higgs fields can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 are goldstone bosons , which will be absorbed by corresponding gauge fields .",
    "the vacuum may not be invariant under @xmath33 transformation although the higgs potential is invariant under this discrete transformation . in fact",
    "there are two ways of spontaneous symmetry breaking , depending on the choice of the sign of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we will discuss these two cases separately below .",
    "1 .   @xmath48 .",
    "+ in this case , vacuum is invariant under transformation @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 + we define higgs boson mass eigenstates as @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( in this paper we assume @xmath1 is heavier than @xmath2 ) , @xmath51 + the higgs boson mass can be expressed as @xmath52 + obviously there must be @xmath48 , which is coincide with the condition of minimizing higgs potential .",
    "2 .   @xmath53 . + for this case , if we require the minimum of higgs potential is stable , then @xmath54 + the higgs boson masses are + @xmath55 + it seems that all the mirror particles must be massless .",
    "however mirror particle can obtain tiny mass through mirror qcd condensation@xcite , but we do nt discuss this case further in this paper .    in this paper",
    "we only consider the first case , i.e. the vacuum is invariant under @xmath33 parity transformation .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath33 discrete symmetry of higgs potential may be broken by small term .",
    "such term will lead to very different effect @xcite .    in order to study the phenomenology of this model",
    ", we choose the higgs boson masses @xmath56 as inputs , so @xmath57    the lagrangian of triple interaction of higgs bosons , which we are interested in , is given by @xmath58 the other triple and quadruple higgs interactions can be inferred from the potential easily which are not shown here .",
    "thus , if kinematically allowed , @xmath59 decay width can be expressed as @xmath60    from eqs .",
    "[ triple ] and [ decaywidth ] , we can see that the large decay width is possible for the favorable parameters .",
    "current electro - weak precision observable ( ewpo ) can give constraints on the physics beyond the sm .",
    "a widely used set of parameters are s , t and u @xcite .",
    "such parametrization assumes that the new physics contributions arise only from propagators of the electro - weak gauge bosons , namely the oblique corrections @xcite .",
    "the mirror model belongs to this case .",

    "we choose @xmath4gev and @xmath5gev as our benchmark point , except indicated otherwise .",

    "<S> the higgs sector may play an important role in detecting the mirror particles , which can be the candidates of the dark matter and appear as missing energy in the detectors at the lhc . in this paper we worked out the higgs boson spectrum and the higgs couplings for the symmetric vacuum , namely @xmath0 , in the mirror model , and investigated the constraints from electro - weak precision observable ( ewpo ) . </S>",
    "<S> our study showed that the ewpo has already constrained the higgs boson sector severely . </S>",
    "<S> we then explored the higgs boson phenomenology , and focused on the scenario that the heavier higgs boson @xmath1 can decay into a pair of lighter higgs boson @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we proposed to study the invisible decay of the higgs boson via the pair production of them , in which one higgs boson decays into bottom quarks and the other decays invisibly . </S>",
    "<S> our detail simulation for signals and backgrounds showed that the observation of signal can reach @xmath3 significance for @xmath4 gev and @xmath5 gev with @xmath6integrated luminosity at the lhc . moreover the possible method to further suppress dominant @xmath7 background was discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we also simulated the signals and backgrounds for @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> our results showed that it is very difficult to isolate the signals from huge qcd continuum backgrounds </S>",
