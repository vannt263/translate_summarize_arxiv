    "the origin of the fermion mass hierarchies and mixing angles remains as one of the biggest mysteries in particle physics .",
    "moreover , the progress in the determination of the neutrino mass splittings and mixing angles over the last decade , far from illuminating the mystery , has drawn a picture showing striking differences between the neutrino parameters and the quark or charged lepton parameters  @xcite .",
    "the puzzle is three - fold : i ) neutrino masses are much smaller than the quark and charged lepton masses , ii ) the mass hierarchy in the neutrino sector is milder than in the quark and charged lepton sectors , iii ) the entries of the leptonic mixing matrix are all @xmath0 while the entries of the quark mixing matrix display the strong hierarchy @xmath1 .",
    "a plausible explanation for the small neutrino masses compared to the quark or the charged lepton masses consists in introducing heavy majorana right - handed neutrinos , much heavier than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale  @xcite .",
    "this is the renown see - saw mechanism . in this framework ,",
    "the overall neutrino mass scale parametrically depends on the square of the neutrino yukawa coupling and on the inverse of the right - handed neutrino mass .",
    "therefore , the see - saw mechanism makes the generic prediction that neutrino masses should be much smaller than the quark or charged lepton masses , although the precise value can not be predicted .",
    "furthermore , and due to the high scale of lepton flavour violation , this framework predicts tiny rates for the rare lepton decays  @xcite , in agreement with the stringent experimental bounds @xmath2  @xcite , @xmath3  @xcite , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "whereas the seesaw model is a compelling framework to explain the smallness of neutrino masses , it tends to generate too large neutrino mass hierarchies  @xcite .",
    "this drawback of the see - saw mechanism is automatically cured by introducing a second higgs doublet .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , even if the tree level neutrino masses display very large hierarchies , quantum effects induced by the second higgs doublet generate a mild hierarchy between the heaviest and next - to - heaviest neutrino masses which is , for well motivated choices of the high energy parameters , in qualitative agreement with the value inferred from oscillation experiments .",
    "the generation of the mass hierarchies for the quark sector in the two higgs doublet model was investigated in @xcite .",
    "assuming tree level yukawa couplings with very hierarchical eigenvalues ( such that they can be considered in practice as rank-1 ) , quantum effects generate , for generic high energy parameters , a mass hierarchy between the second and third generations which is of @xmath5 , in qualitative agreement with the data .",
    "moreover , assuming aligned tree level quark mass matrices , quantum effects generate @xmath6 and @xmath1 , also in qualitative agreement with the measured values .",
    "it was also pointed out in @xcite that a similar mechanism would generate radiatively a muon mass in the presence of right - handed neutrinos ( see also @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we carefully explore the generation of charged lepton and neutrino masses , as well as the leptonic mixing angles , in a simple scenario where the standard model is extended by right - handed neutrinos and one extra higgs doublet . in section",
    "[ section : tree - level ] we present the model and we calculate the lepton masses and mixings in a simplified scenario with just one right - handed neutrino and where all yukawa couplings are rank-1 at the cut - off scale , hence only one generation has non - vanishing tree - level masses .",
    "then , in section [ section : quantum - effects ] we discuss the impact of quantum effects on the leptonic parameters , finding rank-2 charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices . in section [ sec : lfv ] we briefly address the generation of leptonic rare decays in this framework and , finally , in section [ section : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider in this paper an extension of the standard model consisting in adding one extra higgs doublet and at least one right - handed neutrino , singlet under the standard model gauge group .",
    "we do not impose any global or discrete symmetry on the model .",
    "then , the flavour dependent part of the leptonic lagrangian is given by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are flavour indices , @xmath9 is a higgs index and @xmath10 .",
    "it is convenient to work in the higgs basis where one of the higgs fields , say @xmath11 , does not acquire a vacuum expectation value .",
    "therefore @xmath12 , with @xmath13 gev , and @xmath14 .",
    "in this basis , the charged lepton and dirac neutrino masses are proportional to the yukawa couplings @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we choose to work in the basis where the charged lepton yukawa coupling to the higgs @xmath17 , @xmath15 , is diagonal and real .",
    "we assume that the mass scale of the right - handed neutrinos is much larger than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and the mass of all the extra higgs states @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , which we denote collectively by @xmath21 .",
    "hence , at the energies relevant to current experiments , the right - handed neutrinos are decoupled and the theory can be conveniently described by the following effective lagrangian : @xmath22 where , at the scale of the lightest right - handed neutrino mass , the coefficients of the dimension 5 operators @xmath23 read : @xmath24 hence , with our choice of basis for the leptonic and the higgs fields , the neutrino mass matrix at the scale of the lightest right - handed neutrino mass depends just on the coupling @xmath25 : @xmath26 which is diagonalized in the standard way : @xmath27    we consider in what follows a scenario with one right - handed neutrino with mass @xmath28 and where all the yukawa couplings are rank-1 at the cut - off scale @xmath29 , with @xmath30 . by an appropriate choice of the basis for the leptonic fields , it can be checked that the yukawa couplings to the higgs @xmath17 can be written as : @xmath31    on the other hand , the charged lepton yukawa coupling to the higgs @xmath11 must take the most general form of a rank-1 matrix , namely : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are @xmath34 unitary matrices .",
    "the yukawa matrix elements are @xmath35 , hence only the last row of the unitary matrices is relevant , which we parametrize as : @xmath36 and similarly for @xmath37 .",
    "besides , the neutrino yukawa coupling to the higgs @xmath11 must take the most general form of a column matrix : @xmath38 analogous parametrizations for the quark yukawa couplings can be found in @xcite . in what follows we will neglect all the phases for simplicity .    with this parametrization for the parameters at the cut - off scale @xmath29 it is straightforward to calculate the tree - level charged lepton and neutrino masses .",
    "the result is : @xmath39 the leptonic mixing matrix , on the other hand , is not univocally defined since an internal rotation between the first two generations of charged lepton or neutrino fields leaves the lagrangian invariant . as a result",
    ", only the 33 element of the mixing matrix is defined , which reads @xmath40 .",
    "we consider now the impact of quantum effects on the scenario presented in the previous section , where the standard model is extended with one extra higgs doublet and one right - handed neutrino , under the assumption that all yukawa couplings are rank-1 at a cut - off scale @xmath41 .",

    "as discussed in @xcite , the one - loop corrected yukawa coupling @xmath45 is rank-2 , hence radiatively generating a non - vanishing muon mass .",
    "besides , as a consequence of the breaking of the mass degeneracy between the first- and second - generation of leptons , the matrices that diagonalize the yukawa coupling become unambiguously fixed .",

    ", @xmath53    the decoupling of the heavy right - handed neutrino generates dimension five operators , which can be calculated from matching the full theory to the effective theory at the scale @xmath28 .",
    "the result is : @xmath54 which is rank 1 and therefore only has one non - vanishing eigenvalue .",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath55 and the couplings @xmath23 of the dimension-5 operators are subject to quantum corrections between the scale @xmath28 and @xmath21 ; the corresponding renormalization group equations are also given in appendix [ app : beta - functions ] .",

    "one recovers the zero - th order structure of the ckm matrix derived in @xcite .",

    "the ratio between the muon and the tau masses depends on various high - energy parameters , nonetheless , it is possible to estimate the typical size of this ratio for reasonable assumptions about the model parameters . for generic values of the angles that diagonalize the yukawa couplings @xmath85 , one finds @xmath86 for all @xmath68 .",

    "the probability distributions for other values of the yukawa couplings can be straightforwardly determined with an appropriate rescaling of the horizontal axis of the figure .",
    "the large hierarchy measured between the muon and tau masses suggests that the radiative generation of the muon mass is dominated by the right - handed neutrino in the loop , due to the shorter renormalization group running .",

    "<S> we investigate the radiative generation of lepton masses and mixing angles in the standard model extended by one right - handed neutrino and one extra higgs doublet . </S>",
    "<S> we assume approximate rank-1 yukawa couplings at a high energy scale and we calculate the one loop corrected charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices at the low energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> we find that quantum effects generate , for typical high energy parameters , a hierarchy between the muon and the tau mass , a hierarchy between the solar and the atmospheric mass splittings , and a pattern of leptonic mixing angles in qualitative agreement with experiments . </S>"
