    "[ t ] there exist numbers @xmath281 such that if @xmath282 , then the space of equivariant symplectic embeddings from @xmath6 into @xmath11 is homotopically equivalent to a disjoint union of @xmath283 copies of @xmath0 , and if @xmath284 , then it is empty .",
    "it follows easily from lemma [ ss ] , corollary [ lastc ] and the previous observations .",

    "in this section we initiate a discussion on the topology of the space of _ partially equivariant _ symplectic embeddings and sketch some suggestions to answer a question in this direction .",
    "first the notion of @xmath29-equivariance ( @xmath285 ) in section 1 has a natural extension : we say that an embedding from the @xmath1-ball @xmath6 into the @xmath1-dimensional delzant manifold @xmath11 is _ @xmath286-equivariant with respect to a monomorphism @xmath287 , @xmath288 _ , if the following diagram commutes : @xmath289 |{\\circlearrowleft } \\mathbb{t}^{n - k } \\times \\mathbb{b}_r   \\ar[r]^{\\gamma \\times f }       \\ar[d]^ {   { \\cdot } }   &   \\mathbb{t}^{n } \\times m                     \\ar[d]^{\\psi }    \\\\",

    "this definition extends naturally to the case when @xmath293 , in which the embeddings considered are _",
    "purely symplectic _ , as well as to the case when @xmath294 , in which the embeddings are _ fully equivariant _ , case which we treated previously in the paper . unless otherwise specified we do not consider these two cases in the discussion that follows .",
    "the question we would like to address is the following :    [ t2 ] let @xmath71 be such that any connected component @xmath295 of @xmath290 admits a darboux  weinstein neighborhood of radius @xmath71 , and by this we mean a neighborhood that is equivariantly symplectomorphic to a bundle over @xmath295 with fiber the standard ball of radius @xmath71 . is the space of @xmath286-equivariant symplectic embeddings from @xmath6 into @xmath11 homotopically equivalent to the space of purely symplectic embeddings from @xmath296 into @xmath290 up to reparametrization groups as explained below ?    to analyze question [ t2 ] first define @xmath297 to be the embedded @xmath298-ball in @xmath6 , i.e. the set of points @xmath299 in @xmath6 so that @xmath300 .",
    "the preimage under the momentum map of the @xmath51-face corresponding to @xmath286 is the fixed point locus @xmath290 .",
    "now consider any symplectic embedding @xmath301 .",
    "we want to find a canonical way to extend @xmath34 to an equivariant symplectic embedding @xmath302 up to homotopy .",
    "here is an attempt to construct @xmath303 : near the image of @xmath34 , we can apply the equivariant version of the darboux  weinstein s theorem in order to find a neighborhood of @xmath304 in @xmath11 which is symplectomorphic to @xmath305 , with the action of @xmath306 given by the standard action on @xmath307 , and the symplectic form coinciding with the product symplectic form .",
    "note that the symplectic normal bundle to @xmath308 is trivial over @xmath304 because @xmath304 is contractible , so a neighborhood of @xmath304 looks like @xmath305 with a product symplectic form , and the action of @xmath306 on it is conjugate to the standard one . using this identification @xmath11",
    "is described as a product , and we can define @xmath309 .",
    "this expression for @xmath303 is clearly symplectic and equivariant with respect to @xmath306-actions on the last @xmath310 coordinates but is not canonical because the local symplectomorphism given by darboux ",
    "weinstein s theorem is not unique .",
    "we can not expect it to always be the same independently of @xmath34 , because it is not true that globally the normal bundle to @xmath308 is symplectically trivial , it only becomes true over a neighborhood of @xmath304 .",
    "so this construction depends on choices of parameters .",
    "calling @xmath311 the space of canonical embeddings @xmath312 , where @xmath313 is a symplectic embedding , observe that @xmath311 is naturally identified with the space of purely symplectic embeddings from the standard @xmath314 into @xmath290 , up to homotopy .",
    "the question then becomes whether any @xmath286-equivariant symplectic embedding @xmath315 may be deformed through a continuous family of equivariant symplectic embeddings to an embedding in @xmath311 .",
    "equivalently , we ask the question : is the natural map between the space of partially equivariant embeddings from @xmath220 into @xmath11 and the space of symplectic embeddings from @xmath316 into the fixed point set @xmath290 ( given by the restriction to the fixed ball @xmath317 ) a fibration ?",
    "note that the construction of @xmath318 would give a section of this fibration .",
    "question has an affirmative answer .",
    "if @xmath319 with a product symplectic form and product @xmath22-action ( this space has been carefully studied by lalonde  pinsonnault @xcite and anjos @xcite among other authors ) , the fixed point locus of the second @xmath320 factor is @xmath321 , where @xmath322 are the fixed points of the action of @xmath320 on @xmath323 . now , given a symplectic embedding @xmath34 of the ball @xmath324 into @xmath323 , it is easy to build an @xmath320-equivariant embedding of @xmath325 into @xmath326 canonically by @xmath327 , where @xmath328 is taken to be a coordinate centered at the fixed point @xmath329 . in this case",
    "the normal bundle to the fixed point component @xmath330 is globally trivial .",
    "the combination of purely symplectic results of biran , lalonde  pinsonnault and others and an affirmative answer to question 3.1 would give insight into the partially equivariant case in higher dimensions ; for example mcduff showed that if @xmath11 is a symplectic @xmath13-manifold with non - simple seiberg  witten type , then the space of symplectic embeddings from @xmath6 into @xmath11 is path connected ( which extends results of biran ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the non  trivial result : _ any two cohomologous and deformation equivalent symplectic forms on @xmath11 are isotopic _",
    "( proved in @xcite ) .",
    "examples are known in dimensions 6 and above of cohomologous symplectic forms that are deformation equivalent but not isotopic , so these techniques do not help to understand the topology of the space of symplectic embeddings from @xmath6 into @xmath11 .",
    "a positive answer to question [ t2 ] would give the first non  trivial result in dimension @xmath331 .",
    "another way of trying to generalize theorem [ maintheorem ] is to consider embeddings equivariant with respect to a complexity one action , that is , an action of @xmath332 on @xmath333 .",
    "this is a hopeful approach since a complete classification of complexity one actions has been recently achieved by karshon and tolman @xcite .",
