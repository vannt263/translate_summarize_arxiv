    "the interplay between dynamics , structure , and function of complex networks is the subject of intense current research @xcite .",

    "a target node is identified and the attachment is either to the target node itself or to one of its immediate ancestors .",
    "these growth processes result in heterogeneous networks with broad degree distributions .",
    "however , there are no macroscopic hubs because the maximal degree in these networks grows sub - linearly with the network size .    in this study",
    ", we consider the complementary situation where attachment to any ancestor is possible .",
    "we show that the resulting network has a fundamentally different structure : there is coexistence between a hub with a macroscopic degree and highly connected nodes with sub - macroscopic degrees .",

[ fig - tree ] ) :    * the new node selects a target node at random . *",
    "the new node attaches to one node , selected at random from the set of nodes that includes the target node and all its ancestors .",
    "since each new node adds a single link , the growing network retains a tree structure , and apart from the root , each node has a single parent node .",
    "we term the resulting structure the _ random ancestor tree_. an appealing feature of this model is the absence of control parameters .",
    "our motivation for this model comes from social , scholarly , and reference networks @xcite .",
    "for example , the published literature in science , law , and religion grows by sequential addition of material . starting with some reference , a scholar typically studies an entire line of preceding reports or rulings , and refers to the most appropriate or the most important published literature , not necessarily the most recent one @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the evolution of such reference networks is coupled to their genealogy .",
    "we find that the random ancestor tree has a single macroscopic hub , namely the root , that is connected to a fraction @xmath11 of all nodes .",
    "furthermore , the degree distribution is broad as the fraction @xmath7 of nodes with degree @xmath8 decays algebraically , @xmath12 when @xmath13 .",
    "interestingly , the exponent @xmath14 is obtained as a root of a transcendental equation .",
    "we also obtain a series of nontrivial exponents @xmath15 , each characterizing the degree distribution of nodes at the @xmath1th generation . as @xmath1 increases , the exponents @xmath15 increase , so that the nodes become less and less connected as their distance from the root increases .    throughout this paper , we focus on the asymptotic behavior of large trees .",
    "we first analyze the genealogical structure of the random ancestor tree in section [ gt ] .",
    "the depth distribution indicates that the root is a macroscopic hub , and in section [ hubs ] we show that the root is the only such hub .",
    "we then establish ( sec .",
    "[ high ] ) the degree of the most connected nodes at higher generations and discuss the implications of these results for the degree distribution ( sec .",
    "[ degree ] ) . other structural properties including the number of leaves , and the likelihood that the tree has star or chain topology are derived in section [ leaves ] .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ conclude ] .",
    "we treat the random ancestor tree as a genealogical tree and group nodes according to generation ( figure [ fig - tree ] ) .",
    "the first generation consists of nodes at distance one from the root , the second generation includes nodes at distance two from the root , etc . in principle , the number of nodes in each generation fluctuates from one realization to another , yet in the thermodynamic limit such fluctuations are negligible , and we therefore study the average number of nodes in each generation .",
    "let @xmath4 be the total number of nodes in the tree and let @xmath16 be the average number of nodes at distance @xmath1 from the root . only the root belongs to the zeroth generation and therefore , @xmath17 .",
    "the average number of nodes in the first generation , @xmath18 , grows according to the rate equation @xmath19 hereinafter we treat the size of the network @xmath4 as a continuous variable ; our results are asymptotically exact in the limit @xmath20 .",
    "equation reflects that new nodes are added to the first generation only when a new node links to the root .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side corresponds to the situation when the root is chosen as the target node ; the second term accounts for situations when a node in the first generation is chosen  then the probability that the actual link will be to the root is 1/2 ; the following terms describe situations where the target nodes are in higher generations .",
    "the generalization of to arbitrary generation @xmath1 is straightforward , @xmath21 we now introduce @xmath0 , the fraction of nodes that belong to the @xmath1th generation , @xmath22 the coefficients @xmath0 are normalized , @xmath23 .",
    "further , since @xmath24 we have @xmath25 in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "equation shows that the fractions @xmath0 satisfy @xmath27 it is convenient to re - write eq .   as the explicit recursion @xmath28 by evaluating the first few terms , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and by induction , @xmath32 . the normalization condition @xmath33 sets @xmath34 .",
    "thus , @xmath35 indicating that the number of nodes decays super - exponentially with increasing generation or alternatively , depth . hence , the random ancestor tree is exceptionally shallow .",
    "for instance , the average depth is finite : @xmath36 .",
    "the genealogical structure of the random ancestor tree drastically differs from the genealogical structure of other growing networks @xcite .",
    "in particular , random recursive trees @xcite , which grow by attachment of new nodes to random target nodes , have the depth distribution @xmath37 .",
    "thus , there is a sharp peak at @xmath38 , and furthermore , the maximal depth , defined as the deepest non - empty generation @xmath39 , also scales logarithmically with system size , @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this behavior is very robust and occurs in most growing trees @xcite , but there are exceptions where the maximal depth grows algebraically with system size @xcite .    for the random ancestor tree ,",
    "the generation profile is a sharply decreasing function of depth , and from the criterion @xmath41 we estimate the maximal depth @xmath42 this depth behavior reflects that the tree is shallow @xcite .",
    "the random ancestor tree has a macroscopic hub : the root is connected to a finite fraction , @xmath43 , of all nodes as follows from .",
    "such macroscopic hubs are found in social networks @xcite , and have an important function in as transportation networks @xcite . yet , with a few exceptions including super - linear preferential attachment @xcite , most models of network growth have no such hubs and instead , the most central nodes have degrees that grow sub - linearly with network size .    to find out whether , in addition to the root , there are other hubs , let s consider the most connected node at the first generation .",
    "we denote the number of descendants of this node in the second generation by @xmath44 , the number of its descendants in the third generation by @xmath45 , etc .",
    "the equation governing @xmath46 is identical to , @xmath47 with @xmath48 . by definition ,",
    "the node degree is @xmath49 .",

    "since @xmath51 then @xmath52 as well . in general ,",
    "@xmath53 for all @xmath54 . by substituting into",
    ", we find that the coefficients @xmath55 satisfy a recursion relation identical to , @xmath56 any solution to is a linear combination of the two independent solutions : the fast - decaying solution above @xmath57 and the slow - decaying one , @xmath58 when @xmath59 . for the first few coefficients we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath60 implies that we can not express the solution solely in terms of the rapidly decaying solution @xmath57 .",
    "yet , the slowly decaying solution is unphysical because the sum @xmath62 diverges .",
    "therefore , the only possible solution is the trivial one , @xmath63 for all @xmath64 , and we conclude that there are no macroscopic hubs in the first generation",
    ".    similarly , there are no macroscopic hubs in higher generations . if there is a hub in the @xmath1th generation , the recurrence holds for @xmath65 with the boundary condition @xmath66 , or equivalently @xmath67 . by repeating the steps above ,",
    "we conclude that all coefficients @xmath55 vanish .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the degree of the most connected node in the first generation can not be macroscopic .",
    "it is then natural to assume that the degree scales as @xmath68 with @xmath69 , or equivalently @xcite @xmath70 for all @xmath54",
    ". the fractions @xmath71 satisfy @xmath72 obtained by substituting into . therefore , the recursion relation becomes @xmath73 the boundary conditions is @xmath74    certain features can be determined without solving eqs .",
    ". for instance , to obtain the total number of descendants @xmath75 we multiply by @xmath76 and sum over all @xmath76 .",
    "this yields @xmath77 since @xmath78 , we have the bound @xmath79 .    similarly ,",
    "by multiplying by @xmath80 and summing over all @xmath76 we determine the average generation number @xmath81    the second order linear difference equation has two independent solutions .",
    "we obtain the asymptotic behavior of these solutions by converting the difference equation into a differential equation .",
    "if @xmath71 decays sufficiently slow , we may approximate eq .   by the differential equation @xmath82 with solution at large @xmath76 .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath71 decays very quickly , we have @xmath83 in the leading order and therefore @xmath84 .",
    "using this solution as an integrating factor , that is , substituting @xmath85 into eq .",
    ", we have the recurrence @xmath86 .",
    "this recurrence reduces to the differential equation @xmath87 , with power - law solution @xmath88 .",
    "therefore the asymptotic behavior of the second solution to eq .",
    "is @xmath89    equations ",
    "admit a solution for _ arbitrary _ value of @xmath90 . in general , such a solution is a linear combination of the two solutions above .",
    "however , the slowly decaying solution is unphysical . if @xmath91 for @xmath92 , then the depth of the subtree emanating from the most connected node in the first generation , , as follows from the criterion @xmath93 , would exceed the maximal depth",
    "therefore , we must find the special value of @xmath90 for which solution to  is the rapidly decaying solution with the asymptotic behavior .",
    "therefore , @xmath90 is analogous to an eigenvalue .    to determine the proper eigenvalue @xmath90 we use the generating function technique .",
    "we write @xmath94 and convert the difference equation into an integral equation @xmath95 note that @xmath96 for small @xmath97 and in addition , eq .",
    "sets @xmath98 .",
    "given the form of eq .  , we focus on the integral of the generating function , @xmath99 , and convert the integral equation into the differential equation @xmath100 the boundary condition is @xmath101 .",

    "in general , the degree of the most connected node at the @xmath1th generation grows algebraically with the total number of nodes , @xmath119 , and the exponent @xmath120 is function of the generation index @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath121 be the number of descendants of the most connected node at generation @xmath65 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath71 , defined by @xmath122 , again satisfy the recursion with the boundary condition @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",

    "there are , however , two exceptions .",
    "we have already seen that for the zeroth generation @xmath132 and the coefficients @xmath71 can be determined analytically , @xmath133 . for the third generation , @xmath134 and again , the coefficients @xmath71 have simple form @xmath135 this can be verified by direct substitution into .",
    "of course , the solution agrees with the general asymptotic behavior .    using @xmath120",
    ", we calculate several other useful properties .",
    "first , the ratio @xmath128 between the total number of descendants and the degree equals @xmath136 this quantity mildly increases with generation and eventually saturates ( table 1 ) . also , we mention the average distance of a descendant @xmath137 with @xmath138 .",
    "this quantity is given by @xmath139 when @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",
    "like @xmath128 , the average distance slowly grows with generation but ultimately approaches a constant .",
    "hence , statistical properties of average quantities such as the total number of descendants and the distance to a descendant weakly depend on depth , but statistical properties of extreme quantities such as the degree of the most connected node strongly depend on depth .",
    "versus degree @xmath8 . the simulation results ( bullets ) are from @xmath142 independent realizations with @xmath143 . also shown",
    "is a straight line that corresponds to the theoretical result .,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the degree distribution is an important quantity that characterizes local properties of networks . for many growing networks ,",
    "the degree distribution satisfies closed recurrence equations and consequently , this quantity can be determined analytically .",
    "it appears impossible to find a closed set of equations that govern the degree distribution for the random ancestor tree .",
    "remarkably , the closed set of equations allows us to obtain the tail of the degree distribution analytically .",
    "the power - law degree of the most connected node already shows that the degree distribution has power - law tail .",
    "let @xmath7 be the fraction of all nodes with degree @xmath8 .",
    "as announced in , this distribution decays algebraically , @xmath144 for @xmath145 . indeed ,",
    "if we substitute @xmath146 with @xmath147 into the extreme statistics criterion , , we obtain . here , we take @xmath148 because the exponents @xmath120 increase monotonically .",
    "our numerical simulations results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "the simulations are straightforward to implement : with each new node , a target node is selected at random , and then , the attachment node is selected at random from the target node and all of its ancestors . since the average depth remains finite , the computational cost is proportional to the network size and we can simulate networks as large as @xmath143 .",
    "we comment that many real - world networks have power - law degree distributions @xcite as in with exponent @xmath14 in the range @xmath149 .",
    "for example , for the internet at the autonomous systems level , as of 2007 , the exponent is approximately @xmath150 , see @xcite .     versus @xmath1 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    remarkably , the random ancestor tree has a family of degree distributions , each characterized by a distinct nontrivial exponent .",
    "the fraction @xmath151 of @xmath1th generation nodes with degree @xmath8 decays algebraically @xmath152 as in the preferential attachment network , the exponent that characterizes the degree distribution increases with generation @xcite .    from the roots of the transcendental equation with @xmath131 given by , we find that the exponent @xmath15 grows linearly with @xmath1 , that is ( figure [ fig - gn ] )",
    "@xmath153 since @xmath154 and since @xmath0 increases with @xmath1 , the dominant contribution to the distribution @xmath7 comes from first generation nodes .",
    "hence , @xmath155 .",
    "this behavior is in contrast with the preferential attachment network where the behavior at the average generation dominates the degree distribution @xcite .    for completeness , we mention that the in - component distribution mimics the degree distribution .",
    "the degree of the in - component of a node is defined as the total number of its descendants .",
    "the quantity @xmath156 above is always finite and hence , the total number of descendants of the most connected nodes is proportional to the degree . as consequence ,",
    "the fraction @xmath157 of nodes with in - component degree @xmath158 decays algebraically , @xmath159 .",
    "it is also possible to calculate a few other structural properties of the network including the average number of leaves as well as the probabilities that the network has an extreme structure such as a star or a chain .",
    "nodes with no incoming links , or equivalently , nodes with degree one are termed leaves . to calculate the total number of leaves ,",
    "we must first find a more detailed quantity : @xmath160 , the total number of leaves at the @xmath76th generation .",
    "this quantity evolves as follows @xmath161 each new node is necessarily a leaf and hence , the gain term is as in .",
    "the loss term reflects the fact that any new link into a leaf decreases the number of leaves by one .",
    "we assume that the number of leaves in each generation is macroscopic , @xmath162 by substituting this form into the rate equation , we find that leaves constitute a finite fraction of all nodes in each generation , @xmath163 , or equivalently , @xmath164 the fraction of leaves grows with depth : 2/3 of all nodes in the first generation are leaves ; 3/4 of all nodes in the second generation are leaves ; etc .",
    "the total number of leaves , @xmath165 , is the sum @xmath166 and from , we obtain @xmath167 as is often the case in complex networks , a large fraction of all nodes have no incoming links .    it is also possible to calculate the likelihood that the tree has one of two extreme topologies : ( i ) a star where all nodes link to the root , and ( ii ) a linear chain of length @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath168 be the probability that the tree is a star graph .",
    "this probability satisfies the recursion @xmath169 the network is a star graph only if it was previously a star .",
    "furthermore , the factor @xmath170 is the probability that the root is the target node and the factor @xmath171 is the probability that the target node is any one of the @xmath172 leaves , but the actual link is made to the root . with the boundary condition @xmath173 , the probability @xmath168 decays exponentially with the network size , @xmath174    the likelihood that the tree has a chain topology , @xmath175 , obeys the recursion equation @xmath176 .",
    "this recursion reflects that the newest node must always be selected both as the target node and as the attachment node .",
    "the probability for this event is @xmath177 . using the boundary condition @xmath178 ,",
    "the likelihood of growing a chain decays extremely rapidly , @xmath179",
    "^ 2}.\\ ] ] therefore , it is far more likely that the random ancestor tree is a star than it is a chain .",
    "this is another consequence of the shallow nature of the tree .",
    "we introduced a random structure where the genealogy governs the evolution .",
    "the random ancestor tree has a remarkably rich structure .",
    "the network is very tight with a sharply - decaying distribution of depth .",
    "there is a single macroscopic hub that is connected to a finite fraction of all nodes along with multiple highly connected nodes .",
    "the network is strongly stratified because the genealogical structure controls the growth .",
    "the most connected node at distance @xmath1 from the hub has a sub - macroscopic degree that scales as @xmath3 with system size @xmath4 .",
    "interestingly , the exponents @xmath120 are generally transcendental numbers . moreover , the exponents @xmath120 grow monotonically with @xmath1 , and thus , the connectivity sharply declines with increasing depth . as a consequence ,",
    "the degree distribution has power - law tail , @xmath180 with @xmath181 and furthermore , the degree distribution varies strongly with depth .",
    "we obtained all of these features analytically using the total number of descendants of a highly connected node as a function of generation .",
    "this quantity obeys a closed set of equations and it allows us to determine many scaling properties including in particular , the exponent that governs the tail of the degree distribution .",
    "this theoretical technique has promise in other growing trees problems when the degree distribution does not satisfy closed equations @xcite , especially in situations where the distribution of depth becomes independent of system size asymptotically .",
    "the random ancestor tree includes no control parameters but can be easily generalized by various modifications of the attachment process .",
    "more generally , the target node can be selected at a rate that is proportional to the degree and similarly , the attachment node can be determined according to either the generation number or the degree .",
    "we envision that such generalizations can be useful for controlling the degree distribution or the number of macroscopic hubs and hence , relevant for modeling complex networks .",
