    "the slow laser pulse can be treated as a constant electric field , and the problem is thus reduced to that of a photon - stimulated schwinger pair creation .",
    "the appropriate quantity characterizing the effect of the photon on the pair production can be formulated as the attenuation rate @xmath5 for the photon propagation , so that the intensity of the photon beam decreases at length @xmath6 as @xmath7 due to the photon absorption by creation of the @xmath8 pairs .",
    "the attenuation rate , in turn , can be related to the on - shell imaginary part of the vacuum polarization operator @xmath9 in external electric field  @xcite : = -1  .",

    "we consider the on - shell imaginary part of the vacuum polarization operator in external field within a purely semiclassical approach not using the integral form  @xcite .",

    "a deformation of the tunneling trajectory due to the interaction with the incident photon can be neglected as long as the photon energy is small : @xmath53 . in terms of the expansion in the co - moving frame this corresponds to appearance of only a weak ` kink ' in the trajectory at the point of interaction with the photon , which does not invalidate the expansion in small curvature .",
    "however at larger @xmath11 the kink is ` strong ' and the approximation of an unperturbed tunneling path is not valid .",
    "although at present a full calculation in this situation is not available , the exponential factor in the stimulated rate of pair creation can be found using the effective action approach , previously applied  @xcite in similar problems related to an induced decay of metastable vacuum . proceeding in this way ,",

    "it is also satisfying to notice that the linear in @xmath24 term in eq.([piam ] ) agrees with the large @xmath24 asymptotic behavior of the bessel functions in the equations ( [ pipar ] ) - ( [ pim ] ) .",
