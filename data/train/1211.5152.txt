    "it is well known that the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) magnetized plasma interchange instability can be stabilized by a transverse magnetic field . for a given wavenumber ,",
    "allowing a magnetic field component in the direction of the wavenumber introduces alfvnic stabilizing tension such that beyond a critical transverse field ( transverse to the direction of mode symmetry ) that wavenumber is linearly stable.@xcite the nonlinear evolution of the magnetized plasma interchange instability is less well understood .",
    "in particular , the state of the system for when the transverse b - field is marginally subcritical ( or , equivalently , the plasma beta is slightly above critical ) is an important question for magnetized fusion energy applications : does the mode saturate at low amplitude and how does the marginal convection and resulting transport scale with deviation from marginality ?",
    "the question is an important consideration for stellarators , for example , since these fusion devices are engineered for very high precision magnetic fields and one of the precision constraints arises from ideal mhd linear stability results.@xcite if the nonlinear consequence of a slightly subcritical b - field were better understood , it may be possible to optimize over the mhd design constraints .",
    "it was also recently shown that the linear growth rate of ideal interchanges in a reversed - field pinch for a slightly subcritical b - field is weaker than expected and may be overcome by nonlinear effects.@xcite    the interchange mode is a pressure - driven mode that is characterized by the interchange of magnetic flux tubes so that the overall free energy of the system is lowered.@xcite the instability occurs when the equilibrium has a density gradient unfavorable to the direction of a `` gravitational '' force . in systems with curvature",
    ", this force comes from a centrifugal force generated by thermal motion in field curvature .",
    "the mode can be stabilized by introducing a strong enough field , transverse to the flutes , that prevents the flux tubes from being able to freely interchange .",
    "the strength of the stabilizing field can be determined using linear theory and will depend on the steepness of the density gradient and the magnitude of the gravitational force .",
    "there have been a few studies done on nonlinear growth of interchange instabilities at marginal stability in tokamaks.@xcite although a lagrangian approach has been attempted,@xcite the general approach is to expand the equation of motions of the unstable mode about marginal stability and thus the nonlinear terms in the system can be evaluated.@xcite we can determine the overall stability of the system by comparing the behaviour of the nonlinear effects to the linear driving term . in ref .",
    "the author found that , for the profiles investigated , the nonlinear effects were stabilizing .",

    "the author showed nonlinear saturation at marginal stability . both authors considered a system with a sheared magnetic field . in studying the line - tied @xmath4 mode , the authors in ref",
    ".   showed that near the marginally stable point the system was nonlinearly unstable .",
    "however , refs",
    ".   showed that the nonlinear growth transitions through an initial regime where the nonlinear growth dominates the linear response , as shown in ref .  , but a secondary regime takes over when the amplitude is sufficiently large and so the mode amplitude remains bounded .",
    "we simplify our system to a slab geometry where we use an effective gravitational field , @xmath5 , to model centrifugal force due to field line curvature@xcite and we assume a constant transverse field .",

    ", we consider the dynamics of the magnetized interchange mode when the magnetic field strength is strong enough to just stabilize interchanges , i.e. , the system is near marginal stability . in particular , for a given @xmath26 , suppose @xmath29 everywhere in @xmath22 except for a single small region where it is very close to zero , positive or negative . in that case , weakly growing perturbations are possible in the vicinity of where @xmath30 is close to zero .",

    "we can calculate the scale size of this shift based on the values used in the simulation ( see appendix b ) , @xmath160 this implies that there could be a shift in @xmath1 of order @xmath161 . at marginal stability , even small diffusion can cause significant shifts in stable - unstable boundaries .",
    "however , this implies a shift in @xmath1 ; it is harder to explain why resistivity results in a nonlinear instability at large amplitude of perturbation .",
    "it is possible that diffusive effects may affect the critical amplitude for nonlinear instability , but the existence of a nonlinear instability phenomenon is harder to explain as a diffusive effect .",

    "we have used a numerical simulation of the nonlinear , full , compressible , mhd equations with small dissipation to verify our analytical result .",
    "we showed very good agreement between the simulation and the theory for deviations , @xmath2 , from @xmath1 of up to 10% .",
    "the numerical results show that in the short wavelength limit the system is nonlinearly unstable .",
    "there is some disagreement in the time evolution of the density with the analytical result , but this is possible since the analytic calculation is for an ideal system with no dissipation .",
    "we also discussed why a shift in @xmath1 for the linear instability threshold , due to dissipation , is possible at marginal stability and how it is harder to explain why the nonlinear result has an amplitude dependent stability .",
    "furthermore , the dependence is cubic so the mode grows without bound once it is unstable .",
    "this is even harder to explain as a resistive effect .",
    "it should be noted that the fully analytic calculation is facilitated by using a very simple form ( a constant ) for the transverse stabilizing magnetic field .",
    "so , while the conclusions of this paper seem to be on solid ground , the application of these findings to various systems , to the extent that the transverse @xmath172 field of this paper is very special , must be appropriately qualified .",
    "for example , in tokamaks and stellarators , the interchange mode arises on rational surfaces which corresponds to a slab model with a sheared magnetic field vanishing at @xmath89 . in the solar coronal case",
    ", line - tying is an important characteristic absent in our simple case .",
    "nonetheless , the conclusions are sufficiently dissimilar as to indicate further investigation .",
    "thus , for example , a neighboring nonlinear saturated state for the interchange mode was found in refs .",
    " whereas the corresponding result in our case , for @xmath117 , indicates a robustly growing mode with no nonlinear saturation .",
    "of course , the transverse magnetic field in these papers was a sheared field with a rational surface for the unstable wave mode . attempting a marginal stability analysis for sheared field , similar to that used in the present paper , is not straightforward .",
    "the fact that the sheared field goes to zero as @xmath22 goes to zero means that a new inner ordering is required , which makes the calculation more involved .",
    "our results are more consistent with the nonlinear instability found in ref .   where the authors were also in the parameter range with @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 .",
    "it should be noted that their analysis was for the 3d line - tied @xmath4 mode with no transverse field at marginal stability .",
    "even so , the suprising result is that in both cases the system takes off once it becomes nonlinearly unstable .",
    "this occurs even when the linear term is stabilizing .",
    "the primary difference between the results is the amplitude dependence of the nonlinear term . in ref .",
    "the nonlinear term has a quadratic dependence , while our analysis yields a cubic dependence on amplitude .",
    "if we construct an effective potential , we observe that the result from ref",
    ".   indicates a dependence on the sign of the perturbation at the metastable boundary , while our potential is symmetric in @xmath37 .",
    "another difference is that the result in ref .",
    "was somewhat mitigated by refs .   in that the latter papers argued that the ordering giving nonlinear growth would break down at small amplitudes before the instability fully takes off . in our case ,",
    "our numerical simulations seem to show , in agreement with analytic constraints , that the nonlinear instability growth continues without bound and the theory only fails when @xmath176 ( as saturation is reached )",
    ".    our results could also be relevant to tokamak ballooning modes to the extent that these modes are stabilized by an `` average minimum-@xmath172 well '' and thus always have some parallel wavenumber .",
    "work is in progress to quantify this better .",
    "finally , our results also indicate a closer look at interchange stability in stellarators , presumably in average minimum-@xmath172 stabilized systems .",
    "further investigation is necessary to answer some questions regarding the results found in this paper . the transient initial growth in the time traces , mentioned in sec .  [ sec : num ] , needs to be explained .",

    "in simplifying ( [ eq : phi3psi ] ) , we found the functional , @xmath177 $ ] , to be @xmath178=&\\frac{g}{b_c^2}\\rho_0''\\partial_y(\\psi_1\\psi_2)+\\frac{1}{6}\\frac{g}{b_c^3}\\rho_0'''\\partial_y(\\psi_1 ^ 3)\\notag\\\\&+\\mathbf{b}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{\\nabla}_\\perp\\nabla_\\perp^2\\psi_2 + \\mathbf{b}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{\\nabla}_\\perp\\nabla_\\perp^2\\psi_1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above equation can be simplified by writing @xmath51 and @xmath65 a certain way . from ( [ eq : psi2sol ] ) we can write @xmath179 where @xmath180 writing @xmath65 in this way , we get the following results @xmath181 @xmath182 where we have written @xmath183 and @xmath184 @xmath185 the result ( [ eq : app1 ] ) can be derived by multiplying ( [ eq : zeta2 ] ) with @xmath186 and recombining the terms .",
    "similarly , if we multiply ( [ eq : eig ] ) by @xmath187 , we find that @xmath188    since @xmath189 for all orders , we get that @xmath190 and therefore @xmath191 similarly , since @xmath192 then it follows that @xmath193    we can now simplify the last two terms in ( [ eq : func ] ) . using ( [ eq : apppsi2 ] ) we have @xmath194 where we used ( [ eq : app1 ] ) , and took advantage of the fact that @xmath71 has no @xmath27 dependence , to remove the laplacians .",
    "similarly , we use ( [ eq : app2 ] ) to get @xmath195 where we used ( [ eq : app0 ] ) to get the second term .    combining ( [ eq : b1psi2 ] ) and ( [ eq : b2psi1 ] )",
    "we can use ( [ eq : app3 ] ) and ( [ eq : app4 ] ) to further simplify the terms with a gradient operator .",
    "so finally we get @xmath196 we can also rewrite the first term of ( [ eq : func ] ) , @xmath197    we can now substitute for @xmath51 , @xmath71 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 using ( [ eq : psi1sol ] ) , ( [ eq : psibarsol ] ) , ( [ eq : psi2twid ] ) , ( [ eq : psi1widetilde ] ) , and ( [ eq : psi1overline ] ) . as described in section [ sec : third",
    "] , we use the operator @xmath84 on ( [ eq : phi3psi ] ) in order to extract the terms that have a @xmath201 dependence .",
    "the other terms will be irrelevant since the integration will evaluate to zero if the dependence does nt match .",
    "and so we find that @xmath202=\\pi ka(t)^3\\left\\{\\frac{g}{b_c^2}\\rho_0''\\zeta_1\\zeta_2\\notag\\right.\\\\ & -\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{g}{b_c^3}\\left(\\rho_0'\\zeta_1(\\zeta_1 ^ 2)''+\\rho_0''\\zeta_1(\\zeta_1 ^ 2)'+\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0'''\\zeta_1 ^ 3\\right)\\notag\\\\ & \\quad-\\left.\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{b_c}\\zeta_1(\\zeta_1 ^ 2)''''\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , we use the operator @xmath203 on the above equation to get @xmath204=\\pi kl_\\rho a(t)^3\\times\\notag\\\\ & \\left(\\frac{g}{b_c^2}\\langle \\rho_0''\\zeta_1 ^ 2\\zeta_2\\rangle-\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{g}{b_c^3}\\langle \\rho_0'\\zeta_1 ^ 2(\\zeta_1 ^ 2)''\\rangle\\right.\\notag\\\\ & \\quad\\left.-\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{b_c}\\langle\\zeta_1 ^ 2(\\zeta_1 ^ 2)''''\\rangle\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we made use of the fact that @xmath205 decays exponentially at the boundaries to combine the three terms proportional to @xmath206 in ( [ eq : app5 ] ) into one term through integration by parts .    to complete the derivation of ( [ eq : time])-([eq : coeff2 ] ) we still need to simplify the rest of the terms .",
    "it is easy to see that after using the annihilation operator then we get @xmath207 applying the same operator , we find that @xmath208 and therefore , using ( [ eq : eig ] ) , @xmath209 we , once again , took advantage of the boundary conditions to perform some integration by parts to arrive at the above result .",
    "lastly , the operator on the left - hand side of ( [ eq : phi3psi ] ) gives @xmath210 where the second term was thrown away since it evaluates to zero due to the parity of the equilibrium density .",
    "collecting the terms ( [ eq : collect1 ] ) , ( [ eq : collect2 ] ) , ( [ eq : collect3 ] ) and ( [ eq : collect4 ] ) together , we arrive at the ( [ eq : dimtime ] ) .",
    "the two - dimensional numerical simulation solves the following equations : @xmath211 @xmath212 @xmath213,\\ ] ] @xmath214,\\ ] ] @xmath215 where @xmath216\\equiv\\partial_xf\\partial_yh-\\partial_xh\\partial_yf$ ] and @xmath217 @xmath218 the system is initialized with @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "we use @xmath221 for the temperature and @xmath222 for the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the gaussian function sources have amplitude @xmath223 , width @xmath224 and centered around @xmath225 and @xmath226 ( where @xmath131 ) .",
    "the values are chosen by trial and error to create a good @xmath58 profile for the simulation .",
    "the relative strength of the dissipation terms are as follows : @xmath227 the dissipation in the density , @xmath228 , is for numerical stability and is made orders of magnitude smaller than the viscosity @xmath229 . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] the @xmath125 resistivity , @xmath230 , is made smaller than @xmath231 and @xmath229 in order to keep @xmath129 approximately constant .",
    "the crossfield particle diffusion is set by @xmath230 .",
    "since the time and space scales are normalized to the alfvn speed , @xmath9 , and the box size , @xmath132 , the above coefficients imply a viscous magnetic reynolds number of @xmath232 and a lundquist number ( for magnetic diffusion ) of @xmath233 .",
