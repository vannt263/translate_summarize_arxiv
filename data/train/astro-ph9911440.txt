    "this expectation is based on the assumption that the cold dark matter particles were at one time in thermal equilibrium",
    ". however , much heavier relic particles are possible if one invokes non - thermal production mechanisms .",
    "non - thermal decays of inflatons in conventional models of cosmological inflation could yield @xmath185 for @xmath186 gev .",
    "preheating via the parametric resonance decay of the inflaton could even yield @xmath185 for @xmath187 gev .",
    "other possibilities include a first - order phase transition at the end of inflation , and gravitational relic production induced by the rapid change in the scale factor in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to look for possible experimental signatures of superheavy dark matter .",
    "one such possibility is offered by ultra - high - energy cosmic rays .",
    "those coming from distant parts of the universe @xmath188 are expected to be cut off at an energy @xmath189 gev , because of the reaction @xmath190  @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed extensively here , no such greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin cut - off is seen in the data @xcite the ultra - high - energy cosmic rays must originate nearby , and ( unless the intergalactic magnetic field is unexpectedly high  @xcite ) should point back to any point - like sources such as agns  @xcite .",
    "however , no such discrete sources have been identified as yet .",
    "could the ultra - high - energy cosmic rays be due to the decays of superheavy relic particles ? these should be clustered in galactic haloes ( including our own ) , and hence give an anisotropic flux  @xcite , but there would be no obvious point sources .",
    "there have been some reports of anisotropies in high - energy cosmic rays , but it is not clear whether they could originate in superheavy relic decays .",
    "we analyzed  @xcite possible superheavy relic candidates in string  @xcite and/or @xmath0 theory .",
    "one expects kaluza - klein states when six excess dimensions are compactified : @xmath191 or @xmath192 , which we call _",
    "hexons_. however , these are expected to weigh @xmath193 gev , which may be too heavy , and there is no particular reason to expect hexons to be metastable . in @xmath0 theory ,",
    "one expects massive states associated with a further compactification : @xmath194 dimensions , which we call _ pentons_. their mass could be @xmath195 gev , which would be suitable , but there is again no good reason to expect them to be metastable .",
    "we are left with bound states from the hidden sector of string/@xmath0 theory , which we call _ cryptons _",
    "these could also have masses @xmath196 gev , and might be metastable for much the same reason as the proton in a gut , decaying via higher - dimensional multiparticle operators .",
    "for example , in a flipped @xmath111 model we have a hidden - sector @xmath197 gauge group , and the former factor confines four - constituent states which we call _ tetrons_. initial studies  @xcite indicate that the lightest of these might well have a lifetime @xmath198 , which would be suitable for the decays of superheavy dark matter particles .",
    "detailed simulations have been made of the spectra of particles produced by the fragmentation of their decay products  @xcite , and the ultra - high - energy cosmic - ray data are consistent with the decays of superheavy relics weighing @xmath199 gev , as seen in fig .",
    "17  @xcite .",
    "issues to be resolved here include the roles of supersymmetric particles in the fragmentation cascades , and the relative fluxes of @xmath200 and @xmath201 among the ultra - high - energy cosmic rays .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , data on large - scale structure  @xcite and high - redshift supernovae  @xcite have recently converged on the suggestion that the energy of the vacuum may be non - zero , as seen in figs . 1 , 3 . in my view , this represents a wonderful opportunity for theoretical physics : a number to be calculated in the theory of everything including quantum gravity .",
    "the possibility that the vacuum energy may be non - zero may even appear more natural than a zero value , since there is no obvious symmetry or other reason known why it should vanish .    in the above paragraph",
    ", i have used the term _ vacuum energy _ rather than _ cosmological constant _ , because it may not actually be constant .",
    "this option has been termed _ quintessence _ in  @xcite , which discusses a classical scalar - field model that is not strongly motivated by the standard model , supersymmetry or guts , though something similar might emerge from string theory .",
    "i prefer to think that a varying vacuum energy might emerge from a quantum theory of gravity , as the vacuum relaxes towards an asymptotical value ( zero ? ) in an infinitely large and old universe .",
    "we have recently given  @xcite an example of one such possible effect which yields a contribution to the vacuum energy that decreases as @xmath202 .",
    "this is compatible with the high - redshift supernova data , and one may hope that these could eventually discriminate between such a possibility and a true cosmological constant .",
    "however , combinations of structure - formation and cosmic microwave - background measurements may be sensitive to smaller neutrino masses : w. hu , d.j .",
