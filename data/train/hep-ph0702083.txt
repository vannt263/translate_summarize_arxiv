    "for many years now , spin has played a very prominent role in qcd .",
    "the field of qcd spin physics has been driven by the hugely successful experimental program of polarized deeply - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis )  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important results of this program has been the finding that the quark and anti - quark spins ( summed over all flavors ) provide only about a quarter of the nucleon s spin , @xmath0 in the proton helicity sum rule  @xcite @xmath1 implying that sizable contributions to the nucleon spin should come from the gluon spin contribution @xmath2 , or from orbital angular momenta @xmath3 of partons .",

    "to lowest order ( lo ) , the quark and anti - quark spin contribution @xmath6 does not depend on @xmath5 .",

    "several current experiments are dedicated to a direct determination of the spin - dependent gluon distribution @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) denotes the number density of gluons in a longitudinally polarized proton with same ( opposite ) sign of helicity as the proton s , and where @xmath22 is the gluon s light - cone momentum fraction .",
    "the field - theoretic definition of @xmath23 is @xmath24 written in @xmath25 gauge .",
    "@xmath26 is the qcd field strength tensor , and @xmath27 its dual .",
    "the integral of @xmath18 over all momentum fractions @xmath22 becomes a local operator only in @xmath25 gauge and then coincides with @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the compass experiment at cern and the hermes experiment at desy attempt to access @xmath18 in charm- or high-@xmath28 hadron final states in photon - gluon fusion @xmath29 . a new milestone has been reached with the advent of the first polarized proton - proton collider , rhic at bnl  @xcite .",
    "rhic will provide precise and detailed information on @xmath23 , over a wide range of @xmath22 and @xmath5 , and from a variety of probes .",
    "before we discuss in some detail the phenomenology of @xmath23 in polarized high - energy scattering , let us briefly address some of the available theoretical expectations for @xmath23 and its integral .",
    "as was first pointed out in  @xcite , it is possible to estimate the operator matrix element corresponding to @xmath14 in non - relativistic quark and bag models . in such models , for example",
    ", baryon mass splittings result from lowest - order exchange of transverse gluons , and the associated forces are spin - dependent .",
    "one obtains estimates  @xcite for @xmath30 of about @xmath31 to @xmath32 . in a sense , these are `` natural '' values since they are of the order of the proton spin itself .",
    "very recently , for the first time model calculations of the @xmath22-dependence of @xmath23 have been presented  @xcite .",
    "the resulting distribution is positive everywhere and of moderate size .",
    "the more and more precise experimental constraints on @xmath23 will likely motivate further model investigations , which ultimately might lead to new insights into qcd .",
    "likewise , it is to be hoped that lattice calculations , which are becoming ever more powerful , will be able to address gluonic observables in nucleon structure in the future  @xcite .",
    "other considerations , based in part on perturbation theory , led to the prediction of a very large gluon polarization in the nucleon .",
    "the peculiar evolution pattern of @xmath33 visible in fig .  [ fig1 ] inspired ideas  @xcite that a reason for the experimentally found small size of the proton s axial charge should be sought in a `` shielding '' of the quark spins due to a particular perturbative part of the dis process @xmath34 .",
    "the associated cross section is of order @xmath35 , but the @xmath5-evolution of @xmath2 would compensate this suppression .",
    "we note that this interpretation of the axial charge , however , corresponds to a particular choice of factorization scheme . to be of any phenomenological relevance",
    ", such `` anomalous '' models would require a very large positive gluon spin contribution , @xmath36 , even at a low scale of 1  gev or so . as we shall see below",
    ", initial experimental data now appear to make such a scenario very unlikely .",
    "in principle , a clean determination of @xmath18 is possible by investigating scaling violations of the spin - dependent proton structure function @xmath37 which is measured in polarized dis . to leading order of qcd",
    ", @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the quark and anti - quark helicity distributions .",
    "qcd predicts the @xmath5-dependence of the densities through the spin - dependent dglap evolution equations  @xcite : @xmath42 the @xmath43 are the spin - dependent `` splitting functions ''  @xcite which are evaluated in qcd perturbation theory .",
    "as one can see , @xmath23 contributes to the scaling violations of @xmath38 .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath23 has been left virtually unconstrained ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) by the scaling violations observed experimentally in polarized dis .",
    "this is due to the very limited lever arm in @xmath5 of the fixed - target experiments .",
    "figure  [ gluondist ] shows current theoretical `` uncertainty bands '' for @xmath23 from dis scaling violations . at best , a tendency toward a positive @xmath23 is seen .",
    "we note that a recent new analysis by the compass collaboration  @xcite using their latest deuteron dis data  @xcite finds two `` allowed '' regions for @xmath23 , one with positive , one with negative gluon polarization .",
    "clean and precise extractions of @xmath18 over a wide range of @xmath22 and @xmath5 from scaling violations of @xmath38 would become possible at a polarized electron - ion collider , eic  @xcite , thanks to its vastly larger kinematic reach .     from several analyses  @xcite of polarized dis .",
    "the various bands indicate ranges in @xmath23 that were deemed consistent with the dis scaling violations in these analyses . from  @xcite .",

    "the measurement of gluon polarization in the proton is a major focus and strength of rhic  @xcite .",
    "the basic concept that underlies most of spin physics at rhic is the factorization theorem  @xcite .",
    "it states that large momentum - transfer reactions may be factorized into long - distance pieces that contain the desired information on the spin structure of the nucleon in terms of its _ universal _ parton densities , and parts that are short - distance and describe the hard interactions of the partons .",
    "the latter can be evaluated using perturbative qcd . as an example , we consider the double - spin asymmetry for the reaction @xmath44 , @xmath45 where the superscripts denote helicities of the initial protons .",
    "we assume the pion to be produced at high transverse momentum @xmath28 , ensuring large momentum transfer . then , up to corrections suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath28 : @xmath46 for the polarized cross section , where @xmath47 denotes a convolution .",

    "several different processes will be investigated at rhic  @xcite that are very sensitive to gluon polarization : high-@xmath28 prompt photons @xmath52 , jet or hadron production @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and heavy - flavor production @xmath55 .",
    "an important role for the determination of @xmath23 will be played by measurements of two - particle , jet - jet ( or hadron - hadron ) and photon - jet correlations . for these , at the leading order approximation , the hard - scattering subprocess kinematics can be calculated directly on an event - by - event basis , giving an estimate of the gluon momentum fraction  @xcite .",

    "while the initial data from rhic and from the dedicated studies in lepton scattering shown above point to a small or moderate size of the gluon polarization in the @xmath22-region currently accessible , statements about the gluon contribution to the proton spin , @xmath14 , are really not possible yet and will require the global analysis just described .",
    "a crucial issue will eventually be the behavior of the extracted @xmath77 at the smallest accessible @xmath22 , which are reachable in 500  gev running at rhic and in correlation studies involving final states produced at forward angles  @xcite .",
