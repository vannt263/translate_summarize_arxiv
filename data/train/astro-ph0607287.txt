    "recently , @xcite have proposed a new possible origin for low-@xmath0 stars in the metallicity of @xmath3}}<-1.0 $ ] .",
    "they suggested that some metal - poor stars harbor planetary systems and show low-@xmath0 ratios due to engulfing planetesimals .",
    "inspired by this conjecture , we attempt to investigate the abundance pattern of hd134439 and hd134440 , which are the best test samples with the reported low [ @xmath0/fe ] @xcite and the metallicity in the middle of @xmath3}}<-1.0 $ ] . @xcite s sample of low-@xmath0 stars is close to @xmath2}}=-2.0 $ ] while most low-@xmath0 stars in @xcite have @xmath2 } } > -1.0 $ ] . moreover , these two stars are a common proper - motion pair and abundance difference between this pair provides a way to inspect the possibility of harboring planetary systems .",
    "two previous works on abundance determination of this pair @xcite gave inconsistent results for some important elements .",
    "the abundance ratios of [ na / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] show deviations of 0.15 - 0.25 dex .",
    "since these ratios provide crucial information on the formation environment of this pair , it is desirable to make a new analysis with high quality spectra from uves / vlt and hds / subaru by an updated analysis method in the present work .",
    "* moreover , our work will derive abundances for more elements based on more lines .",
    "in particular * , abundances of a few interesting elements , such as k , sc , mn , cu , co and zn , are not available in the literature",
    ". the abundance ratios of these elements provide key clues to their origin and give new information on their nucleosynthesis history .",
    "in order to reduce analysis error and to facilitate the interpretation of resulting abundance , we select hd211998 as a standard star for comparison .",
    "hd211998 is a subgiant , which is expected to be immune to the planet ( if existed ) formation process according to @xcite , and its metallicity is the same as our target stars .",
    "high resolution uves spectra were retrieved from the eso archive with the resolving power of 40,000 and the signal - to - noise ratio of 200 for hd134439/40 and r@xmath460000 and s / n@xmath4400 for hd211998 .",
    "subaru archive data @xcite supplied additional hds @xcite spectra for hd134439 with r@xmath490000 and s / n@xmath4300 . * note that the resolution and signal - to - noise of our hds spectra for hd134439 are higher than those of @xcite and @xcite , while uves spectra have similar resolution and signal - to - noise ratio as those of @xcite . in comparison with @xcite ,",
    "the signal - to - noise of our uves spectra is significantly higher . *",
    "the spectra were reduced by using standard routines in midas software for order identification , background subtraction , flat - field correction , order extraction and wavelength calibration .",
    "bias , dark current and scattered light corrections are included in the background subtraction .",
    "the spectra were then normalized by a continuum function determined by fitting a spline curve to a set of pre - selected continuum windows estimated from the solar atlas .",
    "finally , correction of radial velocity shift , measured from 20 lines , was applied and the equivalent widths were measured by gaussian fitting .",
    "1 shows the comparison of equivalent widths between this work and @xcite .",
    "note that two points showing significant deviations as large as 15 m  are mg lines at @xmath55711for hd134439 and hd13440 respectively .",
    "we have checked that our spectra of hd134439 from uves and hds give the same equivalent widths for this line .",

    "reddening is assumed to be negligible since all stars are within 30 pc from the sun .",
    "we have checked that the slopes of iron abundances versus excitation potential are small .",
    "gravities are derived from hipparcos parallaxes @xcite and metallicities are iterated by abundance analysis .",
    "microturbulences are determined by forcing fei lines with different strengths to give consistent abundances .",
    "stellar parameters and resulting abundances are presented in table 1 .",
    "our temperatures are generally consistent with those in @xcite with deviations of 21k and 67k for hd134439 and hd134440 , respectively , but they are significantly higher than those in @xcite . as noticed in @xcite , spectroscopically - derived temperatures for solar type stars show systematically deviations in opposite directions in different works , and they strongly depend on stellar model atmosphere , the selection of lines , the adopted atomic data , and so on .",
    "we thus prefer the irfm - based photometric temperatures .",
    "furthermore , surface gravities in the present work are derived from parallaxes which are more reliable than those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the microturbulences of this pair adopted by @xcite are 0.7 @xmath8 which are quite low as compared with the usually adopted value of @xmath9 for metal - poor stars in the literature .",
    "the internal error in @xmath7  derived in the present work is around 70k as shown in @xcite .",
    "considering the significant discrepancy with spectroscopically - derived value in @xcite , we adopted the error of 150 k in @xmath7  as the maximum value of temperature error .",
    "errors of other atmospheric parameters are estimated to be 0.15 dex in logg , 0.1 dex in @xmath2}}$ ] and 0.3 @xmath8 in @xmath10 .",
    "the unblended lines with strength strong enough for measurement were carefully selected by using the solar atlas of @xcite .",
    "the oscillator strengths are mainly the same or taken from the same sources as those in @xcite , which are checked for consistency with the sun being one of `` standard '' stars .",
    "the atomic line data and equivalent widths for hd134439 , hd134440 and hd211998 are presented in table a1 , which is published electronically only .",
    "the model atmospheres were interpolated from a grid of plane - parallel , lte models provided by @xcite in which convective overshoot is switched off .",
    "the abontest8 program , developed by p. magain in the lige group , was used to carry out the calculations of theoretical equivalent widths of lines and abundance was derived by matching the theoretical equivalent widths to the observed values .",
    "hyperfine structures for sc , mn , cu and ba are checked to have small effects since the adopted lines are weak in metal - poor stars .",
    "solar abundances from @xcite are adopted to derive the relative abundances . *",
    "since si and zn lines corresponds to high excitation levels and are weak in our stars , they are formed from deep in the stellar atmospheres which is similar as that of feii lines . in view of this",
    ", iron abundances from feii lines were adopted to derive [ si / fe ] and [ zn / fe ] ratios . on the contrary ,",
    "iron abundances from fei lines were used to obtain [ ba / fe ] ratio because baii lines behave more like fei lines rather than feii lines . * in this way , we can expect that errors of [ x / fe ] ratios can be greatly reduced .",
    "for other elements , we follow the general rule that elemental abundances derived from neutron lines are relative to fei lines and abundances from ionized lines are relative to feii lines .        the uncertainties estimated by a change of 150k in @xmath7 , 0.2 dex in @xmath11 , 0.1 dex in  and 0.3 in @xmath10 are shown in table 2 , where numbers with brackets indicate the internal errors by using 70k as an error in temperature .",
    "it shows that abundance errors are 0.12 dex for iron abundances and less than 0.1 dex for [ x / fe ] ratios even the external error of 150k is used . clearly , main errors in abundances of most elements come from the uncertainty of temperature .",
    "the abundance errors will be greatly reduced ( about 0.07 dex ) when the internal error in temperature of 70k is adopted .",
    "the comparisons of uur abundances with those in @xcite and @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "generally , our values are quite similar with @xcite .",
    "the [ na / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] show the largest deviations around 0.1 dex .",
    "note that more lines are used in the present work to derive abundances while only one line for na and three lines for ca are adopted in @xcite . in comparison with fulbright ( 2000 )",
    ", there is a large disagreement by 0.2 - 0.3 dex in [ na / fe ] and [ si / fe ] .",
    "since our abundances are derived with a more reasonable atmospheric parameters based on spectra with higher signal - to - noise , they may be more reliable .",

    "probably , the two field low @xmath0 stars have formed from a dusty environment where dust from the late stages of stellar evolution in a prior generation of stars contaminated the pro - stellar material of this pair . in connection with the dust observations , this suggestion is promising since the existence of very cold dust in low metallicity galaxy has been reported @xcite which indicates that the mass ratio of dust - to - gas ratio is significantly higher than normal value in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the depletion pattern of gas onto dust in a prior generation of stars shows a decreasing depletion factor for elements with higher condensation temperatures @xcite . therefore ,",
