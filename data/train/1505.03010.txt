    "baryon - strangeness correlation is an effective diagnostic tool for the relevant degrees of freedom of the hot nuclear matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "it has been extensively investigated by various phenomenological models of high energy collisions @xcite and first - principle calculations in lattice qcd @xcite . the correlation is usually quantified by @xcite @xmath4 here , angle brackets denote the event / ensemble average . in the second step ,",
    "strangeness neutrality @xmath5 is applied to relativistic heavy ion collisions . for a deconfined system consisting of free quarks and antiquarks , @xmath6 because strangeness is carried only by the strange ( anti-)quarks which carry the baryon number in strict proportion to their strangeness with the coefficient -1/3 , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast , the relation between baryon number and strangeness in a hadron system is multiple , e.g. , baryon number 1 for a strange baryon but 0 for a strange meson .",
    "@xmath3 of hadron system is usually smaller than one ( at low baryon number density ) due to the fact that most strange quarks , at hadronization , will come into mesons instead of baryons which unlock the intimate baryon - strangeness correlation existed previously in quarks .",
    "statistical model estimation of @xmath3 for a hadron resonance gas at zero baryon number density is about 0.66 @xcite .",
    "calculations of lattice qcd also show that the @xmath3 of the strong - interacting system at temperature above the phase transition temperature @xmath8 tends to one while near and below @xmath8 the system @xmath3 decreases rapidly @xcite .",
    "hadronization refers to the process of the formation of hadrons out of quarks and/or gluons , accompanying with the change of the correlation between baryon number and strangeness .",
    "phenomenological models describing the hadronization should reproduce this change of baryon - strangeness correlation due to the transformation of the degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "quark combination is one of the effective mechanisms for the hadronization of the hot quark matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions and has explained lots of experimental phenomena in heavy ion collisions at sps , rhic and recent lhc , see , e.g. refs@xcite .",
    "the change of baryon - strangeness correlation during quark combination hadronization is intuitive .",
    "a strange quark(antiquark ) combines with a light antiquark(quark ) to form a strange meson , which completely destroys the original baryon - strange correlation carried by strange ( anti)quark , i.e. , @xmath9 , but inherits the strangeness lossless .",
    "occasionally , a strange quark combines with a strange antiquark to form a hidden - strange meson , which inherits nothing from original quarks . on the contrary , in the baryon formation",
    "a strange quark combines with two light quarks to form a baryon , which alters the baryon - strangeness correlation coefficient @xmath10 .",
    "the combination of two strange quarks with one light quark also alters the correlation coefficient @xmath11 .",
    "obviously , the @xmath3 of the system depends on the relative proportion of the produced baryons to mesons .    in this paper",

    "we discuss in details how the dynamics of baryon - meson production competition at hadronization to dominate the @xmath3 of hadron system . in addition",
    ", we study the dependence of @xmath3 on the strangeness content and the baryon number density of the system , which is related to the hot quark system produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions at different collisional energies .",
    "we compare our results with the calculations of lattice qcd @xcite and the prediction of statistical model for a hadron resonance gas @xcite .",

    "iii , using the model we explain the experimental data of the mid - rapidity yields of strange hadrons that are most relevant to @xmath3 calculations in central pb+pb collisions at @xmath12 tev . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the @xmath3 of the hadron system in which two assumptions are made for initially produced hadrons .",
    "one assumption is that different kinds of hadrons are uncorrelated , which can be expected in the case that the quark system existed previously is made up of free quarks and antiquarks ( @xmath1 ) . in this paper , we only consider this kind of quark system since the effects of hadronization on system @xmath3 are already addressed properly .",
    "the other assumption is poisson statistics for yield fluctuations of hadrons . in sec .",
    "v , we present a different approach of calculating @xmath3 which is beyond poisson statistics and can also reflect intuitively the essence of baryon - strangeness correlation .",
    "summary and discussion are finally given in sec .",
    "in this section , we present a working model of the yields of hadrons that are produced from the deconfined quark phase after hadronization in the framework of quark combination mechanism , for the facility of the subsequent correlation studies . as discussed in introduction , baryon - strangeness correlation @xmath13 is strongly dependent on the relative production of baryons to mesons , which requires our model to well address this point .",
    "therefore , we introduce the working model according to the following strategy : ( 1 ) give the global properties for the global production of all mesons , all baryons and all antibaryons , in which the production competition of baryons against mesons is properly addressed .",
    "( 2 ) on the basis of ( 1 ) , give the yield formulas of various identified hadrons .    in previous work @xcite",

    "[ cbs2lsrbm ] and fig .",
    "[ cbsd1lsrbm ] can be naturally understood via the definition @xmath186 . because both the nominator @xmath187 and denominator @xmath188 are dependent on the strangeness mainly by the single - strange hadrons , the strangeness dependence are thus partially offset in their ratio and we observe a weak dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath119 . on the other hand ,",

    "in addition , the increase of @xmath32 enhances the production weights of ( strange ) baryons against mesons and contributes largely to the nominator @xmath187 and we observe a rapid increase of @xmath13 with the increasing @xmath32 .    since results in current approach hold more generally than those in sec .",

    "our calculated @xmath3 is 0.78 , which best conforms to the lattice qcd calculations @xmath193 at @xmath194 gev within its theoretical uncertainty @xcite .",

    "these effects of @xmath147 and @xmath119 on the @xmath3 of the system are similar to those calculated in sec .",

    "these different predictions may be identified in future by calculating the higher - order susceptibilities for the conservative charges of the system .",
    "the other difference between qcm prediction and statistical model is the position that the @xmath3 of hadrons reaches one .",
    "qcm predicts the position at @xmath198 gev corresponding to the aa collisions at collisional energy about 12 gev while statistical model predicts the position at @xmath199 gev corresponding to the collisional energy about 9 gev .",
    "the beam energy scan programme of star collaboration can distinguish these two different predictions .",
    "hadronization describes the process of the formation of hadrons out of quarks and/or gluons . in the meanwhile , the correlation properties between conservative charges of the system change also due to the transformation of basic degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "phenomenological models mechanisms of the hadronization should reproduce these changes of charge correlation properties during hadronization process for the system . in this paper",
    ", we have studied the change of the baryon - strangeness correlation caused by hadronization in the quark combination mechanism .",
    "we found that this correlation is a good quantity of studying the hadronization because of its sensitivity on the dynamics of production competition between baryons and mesons .",
    "we calculated the correlation coefficient @xmath200 of initial hadrons produced from the deconfined free quark system with @xmath1 .",
    "the calculated @xmath13 of initial hadrons under poisson fluctuation is about 0.65 at zero baryon chemical potential , which is consistent with the prediction of statistical model for the hadron resonance gas .",
    "beyond poisson statistics , we calculated @xmath13 of initial hadrons by @xmath201 .",
    "the resulting @xmath13 at zero baryon chemical potential is about 0.78 , comparable to the calculations of lattice qcd in the phase boundary at @xmath202 mev .",
    "this suggests that the quark combination , as a phenomenological microscopic mechanism , is able to describe the change of conservative charge correlations at hadronization , revealing certain basic dynamics of the realistic hadronization process .",
    "we also predicted the correlation coefficient of hadrons at different baryon chemical potentials and compared them with the existed calculations of statistical method .",
    "these predictions are expected to be tested by the beam energy scan experiment of star collaboration at rhic and/or by the future lattice qcd calculations at non - zero chemical potentials .",
    "finally we would like to comment the measurement of @xmath3 directly by the definition eq .",
    "( [ def_cbs ] ) either in realistic experiments or in model simulations using an event generator , which already has lots of discussions in literatures . to measure the @xmath3 in general we usually have to select a finite accept window , e.g.  mid - rapidity region @xmath203 . selecting",
    "a small window size will increase the poisson statistical fluctuations while selecting a wide window size will inevitably involve the global conservation effect of baryon number and in particular of the strangeness . amending such a finite window effect",
