    "the aim of transmission network expansion planning ( tnep ) is to resolve the issue of how to expand or enhance an existing electricity transmission network in order to adequately satisfy demand for a given horizon .",
    "the main difficulty of this problem is decision - taking with the great amount of uncertainty associated with i ) demand , ii ) generation with renewable energy sources , such as wind and solar power plants , and iii ) equipment failure .",
    "two main frameworks have been used to tackle these uncertainties , stochastic programming @xcite and robust optimization @xcite .    in stochastic programming problems ,",
    "uncertain data is assumed to follow a given probability distribution and is usually dealt with by using scenarios or finite sampling from the joint probability density function .",
    "examples of the successful application of stochastic programming in tnep problems are given by @xcite among others .",
    "however , the number of scenarios needed to represent the actual stochastic processes can be very large , which may result in intractable problems .",
    "conversely , robust optimization can avoid the intractability issue related to stochastic programming approaches .",
    "note that tractability is not the only difficulty stemming from stochastic programming , but it is the most important aspect from the point of view given in this paper .",
    "examples of the successful application of robust optimization in tnep problems are given by @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we focus on the seminal works proposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    the three works on which our proposal is based formulate the problem using an adaptive robust optimization ( aro ) framework @xcite .",
    "therefore , all of them use three - level formulations : i ) the first level minimizes the cost of expansion ( @xcite also minimizes the maximum regret ) , the decision variables for this level are those associated with construction or expansion of lines , ii ) the second level selects the realization of the uncertain parameters that maximizes the system s operating costs within the uncertainty set , the variables related to this level are the uncertain parameters , i.e. , generation capacity and demand , and iii ) in the third level the system operator selects the optimal decision variables to minimize operating costs for given values of first and second level variables .",
    "note that in this paper we do not consider contingencies explicitly , although , they could be taken into account within robust formulation following the guidelines set out by @xcite .",
    "jabr @xcite merges the second and third levels into one single - level maximization problem ( so called subproblem in this paper ) by using the dual of the third level .",
    "it takes advantage of the fact that all uncertain parameters need to be equal to their upper or lower limits in the worst case scenario , which allows the use of binary variables to deal with these uncertain parameters .",
    "the limitation of this simplification is that the uncertainty budget , typically used in robust optimization , must be an integer .",
    "however , in our opinion , this does not detract from the benefits of robust optimization , while it does simplify the resolution of the problem substantially .",
    "in contrast , in references @xcite the second and third levels are merged into one single level maximization problem by using the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions for the third level . in this particular case , the number of constraints , continuous and binary variables of the subproblem increase with respect to the other approach .    regarding the resolution of the resulting bi - level problem , jabr @xcite sets out a benders @xcite approach where the dual information from subproblems is used to make additional benders cuts .",
    "the main drawback of this approach is the slow convergence typical of this type of decomposition algorithms , which forced the author to include additional linear constraints in order to improve convergence . on the other hand , cheng et al .",
    "and ruiz and conejo @xcite applied a constraint - and - column @xcite generation method solely based on primal cuts .",
    "this method is computationally advantageous with respect to benders decomposition and converges in a small number of iterations ( authors reported solution results with only 3 - 4 iterations required ) .",
    "note that the methodologies proposed by @xcite and @xcite are basically the same from a mathematical point of view , although , they analyse different situations and ruiz and conejo @xcite set out a different way to construct the uncertainty sets .    in this paper an alternative approach to solving the three - level mixed - integer optimization problem associated with tnep is set out .",
    "the concept elaborated on in this paper is to combine the way the inner level problems ( subproblems ) are solved by @xcite and the constraint - and - column generation method used by @xcite and @xcite for the first level problem ( master problem ) .",
    "note that although the master problem solved by means of primal cuts is very efficient , computing times associated with the approaches adopted by @xcite and @xcite increase exponentially with respect to the size of the problem .",
    "this is due to the subproblem , which consumes most of the resolution time due to the use of the kkt optimality conditions for the third level in the second level problem .",
    "the resulting model simultaneously calculates the third level primal and dual variables , and as the primal variables are not required to construct the primal cuts of the master , this alternative consisting in use of the kkt conditions is inefficient .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ s1 ] describes the adaptive robust formulation of the tnep problem in compact matrix form , and discusses the approaches for finding solutions set out in references @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the detailed formulation is only given in the [ detfor ] .",
    "in section  [ s2 ] the definition of the uncertainty set and the description of the approach for finding a solution are set out .",
    "numerical results for different networks are given in section  [ casestudy ] and compared with those obtained using the method proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "according to references @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the robust tnep problem can be written in compact matrix form as the following three - level mathematical programming problem : @xmath0{c}\\mbox{minimize } \\\\ { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$\\unboldmath}}}\\end{array}\\begin{array}[t]{c}\\left({{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ c$\\unboldmath}}}^t{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$\\unboldmath}}}+{\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{0.8}\\begin{array}[t]{c}\\mbox{maximum } \\\\ { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ d$\\unboldmath}}}\\in { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ d$\\unboldmath}}}\\end{array}\\begin{array}[t]{c}{\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{0.8}\\begin{array}[t]{c}\\mbox{minimum } \\\\ { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ y$\\unboldmath}}}\\in \\omega({{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$\\unboldmath}}},{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ d$\\unboldmath}}})\\end{array}\\begin{array}[t]{c}{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$\\unboldmath}}}^t\\end{array } \\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1}}{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ y$\\unboldmath}}}\\end{array } \\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1}}\\right)\\end{array } \\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1}}\\ ] ] subject to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the vector of first stage binary variables representing the _ investment _ vs _ no investment _ in reinforcing or building new lines , @xmath3 is the investment cost vector , @xmath4 is the second stage continuous variables vector representing the random or uncertain parameters , i.e. generation capacities and level of demand , @xmath5 is the uncertainty set , @xmath6 is the vector that includes operating costs , and @xmath7 is the third stage continuous variables vector referring to operating variables .",
    "these operating variables include power consumed , power flows , power produced by generating units , load shed by demand and voltage angles at buses ( see [ detfor ] for a detailed description of the formulation ) .",
    "@xmath8 represents the maximum budget for investment in transmission expansion .",
    "finally , @xmath9 defines the feasibility region for the operating variables @xmath7 , as a function of investment decisions @xmath2 and given realizations of the uncertain parameters @xmath4 , as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are matrices with constant parameters dependent on the network configuration and element characteristics , @xmath17 selects the components of @xmath7 that are equal to the uncertain parameters ( demand ) , and @xmath18 selects the components of @xmath7 that are limited by the uncertain parameters ( i.e. maximum power generation and maximum load shedding ) .",
    "the first set of equality constraints correspond to those enforcing the power balance at every bus , the power flow through each line , and fixing the voltage angle of the reference bus .",
    "the second set of inequality constraints are associated with line flow limits , and limits on the voltage angles at every bus .",
    "note that @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the dual variable vectors associated with each set of constraints , respectively .    for a detailed physical interpretation of the mathematical formulation ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] )",

    "the master variables correspond to @xmath2 , i.e. the first stage binary variables vector .",

    "this simplification consists in assuming that the uncertain parameters are either at the nominal , upper or lower limits of their uncertainty range , as shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the optimal solution for the subproblem ( [ subproblem1])-([subproblem2 ] ) provides the dual variable information and the uncertain parameter values to construct benders cuts for the master problem .",
    "the main problem of this type of decomposition algorithm is the slow convergence property , which forced the author to include additional linear constraints obtained from a number of previously computed realizations of the uncertainty vector .",
    "these additional cuts accelerate convergence .",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite and ruiz and conejo @xcite also propose dealing with problem ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) by decomposing and iteratively solving a subproblem and a master problem .",
    "the master variables correspond to @xmath2 , i.e. the vector of first stage binary variables . however , these authors set out a different solution strategy .",
    "in particular , the third - level minimization problem is substituted into the subproblem ( [ subproblem ] ) because of its kkt conditions , with which the following single level maximization problem is obtained : @xmath28{c}\\mbox{maximize } \\\\ { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ d$\\unboldmath}}},{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ y$\\unboldmath}}},{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\lambda$\\unboldmath}}},{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\mu$\\unboldmath}}},{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\alpha$\\unboldmath}}},{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\varphi$\\unboldmath}}}\\end{array}\\begin{array}[t]{c}{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$\\unboldmath}}}^t{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ y$\\unboldmath}}}\\end{array } \\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1}}\\ ] ] subject to @xmath29 where constraint ( [ subproblem6 ] ) results from differentiating the lagrangian of the third - level problem with respect to third - level variables @xmath7 , and constraints ( [ subproblem7 ] ) and ( [ subproblem8 ] ) represent the complementary conditions associated with inequality constraints from ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "subproblem ( [ subproblem3])-([subproblem9 ] ) is a nonlinear mathematical programming problem , which can be linearized and transformed into a mixed - integer linear mathematical programming problem at the expense of using the fortuny - amat @xcite transformation , which requires including a binary variable for each inequality constraint . for more details about fortuny - amat transformation related to this specific application ,",
    "see reference @xcite .    the optimal solution of subproblem ( [ subproblem3])-([subproblem9 ] ) provides the uncertain parameter values @xmath30 to construct primal cuts for the master problem at iteration @xmath31 , which corresponds to the following optimization problem : @xmath32{c}\\mbox{minimize } \\\\ { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$\\unboldmath}}},{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ y$\\unboldmath}}}_{(i)};\\;\\forall i= 1,\\ldots , k-1\\end{array}\\begin{array}[t]{c}{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ c$\\unboldmath}}}^t{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$\\unboldmath}}}+\\gamma\\end{array } \\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1}}\\ ] ] subject to @xmath33    this master problem , besides variable @xmath34 , includes one operating variable vector @xmath35 for each realization of the uncertain parameters obtained from subproblem ( [ subproblem3])-([subproblem9 ] ) . unlike the benders master problem set out in @xcite , this algorithm converges in a few iterations without needing to include additional primal cuts besides those included by the iterative process itself . note that the additional constraints included by jabr to improve convergence of the benders algorithm , obtained from a prespecified number of previously computed realizations of the uncertainty vector , is a similar strategy with respect to the column - and constrained generation method",
    "however , in the latter case , those realizations are obtained by the process itself , which speeds up convergence .",
    "in this section the solution technique is set out and justified in detail .",
    "however , before focusing on the mathematical description of the solution method , we will justify the uncertainty set type used in this paper .      to deal with uncertainty we use cardinality constrained",
    "uncertainty sets @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use the same definition of uncertainty set as that given in @xcite but distributed by type of random parameter ( generation capacity @xmath36 or demand @xmath37 ) and per region @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the uncertain generation limit related to the @xmath41th variable within vector @xmath4 , @xmath42 is the corresponding nominal value , @xmath43 is the maximum positive distance from the nominal value that can take the random parameter , and @xmath44 is the set of indices of the generating units .",
    "analogously , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 correspond to the same values but for demand .",
    "additionally , the following constraints associated with budget uncertainty must hold : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the set of indices for region @xmath38 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are auxiliary continuous variables with the following characteristics @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the maximum number of random parameters for generation capacity and demand , respectively , which may reach their lower or upper limits within region @xmath38 .",
    "we include the discrimination by region according to that set out by @xcite .",
    "it must be stressed that the auxiliary variables @xmath51 and @xmath52 are initially assumed to be continuous .",
    "however , in order to solve the robust tnep such as by @xcite , these variables will be considered as binary .",
    "the only limitation introduced by this simplification is that uncertainty budgets @xmath55 and @xmath56 must be integer values , which in our opinion does not detract from the benefits of robust optimization from a practical perspective .",
    "in addition to the simplification proposed by jabr @xcite , we also consider the discovery of ruiz and conejo @xcite consisting of the worst outcome in `` nature '' is for generation capacities to be as low as possible whilst demand loads is as high as possible . according to this ,",
    "our uncertainty sets are finally defined as follows : @xmath57    alternatively , instead of uncertainty budgets associated with generation , demand and regions @xmath55 and @xmath56 , a unique uncertainty for each region @xmath58 , or for the system @xmath59 could be used instead .",
    "note that we do not use the uncertainty set defined by ruiz and conejo @xcite because in its current form it does not provide appropriate interpretation with respect to robustness .",
    "the definition of the uncertainty set given by @xcite is : @xmath60 this formulation presents the following interpretation problem .",
    "if @xmath61 or @xmath62 , the uncertainty variables associated with generation take the minimum possible values @xmath63 and those random variables related to load demand take the maximum possible values @xmath64 .",
    "this scenario corresponds to the maximum level of uncertainty @xcite as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath65 or @xmath66 , the uncertainty variables associated with generation take the maximum values possible @xmath67 and those random variables related to load demand take the minimum possible values @xmath68",
    ". this scenario does not correspond to the _ no uncertainty _ case as pointed out in @xcite , but rather to the most favourable one from the system operation perspective , and capacity expansion planning using this uncertainty budget would probably result in null investments and the resulting network could be congested for all possible values of the random parameters within the uncertainty set . because of this it is difficult to interpret intermediate situations @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "once the uncertainty set is properly defined , we focus on our methodological proposal for solving problem ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) .",
    "it is based on the following observations :    1 .",
    "the subproblem defined by jabr @xcite is much more efficient than that proposed by cheng et al .",
    "@xcite and ruiz and coenjo @xcite .",
    "note that the number of binary variables is equal to the number of uncertain parameters ( cardinality of @xmath71 plus cardinality of @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 ) , which are the only variables involved including the dual variables of the third - level problem and the uncertain parameters themselves .",
    "conversely , the subproblem defined using the kkt conditions of the third level problem includes the uncertain parameters , the primal and dual variables of the third - level problem .",
    "the number of binary variables associated with the maximum generation capacities and upper bounds of load - shedding are just equal to the number of uncertain parameters , and we have to include two additional binary variables per limit associated with the following variables : line flow , voltage angles , power generation and load - shedding .",
    "this results in a much bigger and complex subproblem to solve .",
    "2 .   furthermore",
    ", the only variables required for the master problem set out by @xcite and @xcite are the uncertain parameters .",
    "therefore , calculation of the primal variables within the subproblem is useless and inefficient .",
    "the master problem proposed by @xcite and @xcite based on primal cuts is at an advantage in computing terms with respect to the benders master problem based on dual cuts set out by @xcite .",
    "it converges in a few iterations and does not require including additional cuts artificially .    for the reasons given above , we use as a subproblem a slight modification of that proposed by jabr @xcite and as a master problem that set out by @xcite and @xcite , as follows :    subproblem : : :    the subproblem is aimed at obtaining for given values of the    investment variables , i.e. for a given network configuration , the    worst outcome for uncertain parameters producing the maximum optimum    operational cost . in terms of equations",

    "note that in comparison with the subproblem proposed by jabr in @xcite , we take advantage of the fact that we know in advance what uncertain variables tend , respectively , to the upper and lower limit of the uncertainty set . this strategy allows the number of binary variables to be halved .    finally , the iterative scheme set out is described step by step on the following algorithm :    iterative method    input : : :    selection of uncertainty budgets @xmath55 and    @xmath56 for each region and the tolerance of the    @xmath94 process . this data is selected by the    decision maker .",

    "conversely , with the method set out in this paper the optimal solution was reached in less than one minute for all instances of budget uncertainties .",
    "the maximum number of iterations required was 5 .",
    "the difference in computing time is associated with the solution to the subproblem .",
    "that set out by @xcite and @xcite has 4115 equations , 2367 continuous and 1018 binary variables , while the subproblem set out in this paper contains 1548 equations , 1712 continuous and 145 binary variables .",
    "the difference in complexity between both subproblems is apparent and explains the large difference in computing time between both methods .",
    "numerical experiments demonstrate that the method set out in this paper is computationally more efficient than that by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this result is evident considering the difference in complexity of the subproblem .",
    "note that ruiz and conejo @xcite already claimed that the most time - consuming stage of their process was the subproblem resolution , and it is the subproblems solved by our method that really makes a difference in terms of saving computational time , while master problems remain unchanged .",
    "we have not reported results with respect to the method proposed by jabr @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is also evident that our method is more efficient because we use the same subproblem whilst halving the number of binary variables .",
    "this difference might imply large computing time differences for large problems .",
    "in fact , the larger the problem , the larger the difference which is due to how standard branch - and - cut solvers function .",
    "the only uncertainty as to whether our method is faster might stem from the master problem .",
    "however , the number of iterations reported in this paper and in references @xcite and @xcite are always lower than or equal to 5 , while the number of iterations reported by @xcite varied considerably depending if additional cuts were included or not , but they were usually above 5 or more .",
    "furthermore , this strategy of including additional primal cuts could be used in our master problem by just considering additional outcomes for uncertain parameters as jabr @xcite does in his work . nevertheless , because of the convergence behavior this is not necessary .",
    "in this paper a new decomposition algorithm has been set out to attain the exact solution for the tnep problem stemming from the use of a two - stage adaptive robust strategy .",
    "although there is nothing novel with respect to the formulation of the problem , we have managed to combine formulations and findings from different authors in the proper manner",
    ". therefore , in terms of computational efficiency , our method leads , occasionally by a large margin , than other methodologies in use .",
    "we have run several computational experiments to show how the algorithm set out in this paper functions with respect to the approach set out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been demonstrated that the computational time required by this algorithm is always lower than those set out by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the subproblem set out in this paper is less complex and has fewer binary variables than as is the case in other research , while the primal master problem is equal to that set out by @xcite and @xcite , which is at an advantage in terms of computing with respect to the benders master problem used in @xcite , and , moreover , the inclusion of additional cuts from given realizations of the random parameters is not required .",
    "bearing in mind that with the method set out all features as regards robust optimization design with respect to their predecessors were maintained , the algorithm set out in this paper turned out to be the most efficient method for solving the robust transmission network expansion planning to date , and takes advantage of state - of - the - art mixed - integer mathematical programming solvers .",
    "the only limitation is the integrality constraint of budget uncertainty , which simplifies the subproblem considerably although without detracting from the benefits of using robust optimization .",
