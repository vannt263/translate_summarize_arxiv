    "applications of slow and stored light based on electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) , in both quantum information processing and optical communication , will benefit from improved efficiency and delay - bandwidth product . in quantum information ,",
    "stored light has emerged as a promising technique for applications such as single - photon generation on demand  @xcite and quantum memories  @xcite and repeaters  @xcite . however",
    ", practical applications will require significant improvements in the efficiency of writing , storing , and retrieving an input photon state beyond values achieved to date  @xcite . in classical communications ,",
    "optical buffers require adjustable delay time ( i.e. , group index ) for input signal pulses with minimal pulse distortion and loss  @xcite and high compression of the input pulse for high data density inside the delay medium .",
    "however , high efficiency and large delay - bandwidth product have not fully been realized in all - optical systems .",
    "here we present a preliminary study of the optimization of slow and stored light using eit in warm rb vapor as a function of optical depth , laser power , and input pulse bandwidth .    in eit , a weak signal pulse propagates with very slow group velocity through",
    "an otherwise absorbing medium  @xcite , which is established by a strong control field",
    ". the reduced group velocity with which a signal propagates under eit is the result of the transfer of photonic excitation in the pulse to the collective spin coherence of the atoms .",
    "the group velocity is proportional to the control field intensity , and can be reduced to zero by shutting off the control light . in this case the photonic information of the pulse is completely transferred to the atoms .",
    "this coherent transfer is reversible , and thus after some storage time the pulse may be retrieved , converting it back into photonic excitation when the control light is turned back on .",
    "optimization of slow and stored light requires reducing the absorption of signal light and spin decoherence , as well as increasing optical depth to achieve a large delay - bandwidth product  @xcite . in warm atom vapor cells ,",
    "signal light absorption is typically driven by incomplete polarization of the atomic medium due to such mechanisms as radiation trapping and competing nonlinear processes .",
    "atomic decoherence arises from mechanisms such as collisions with buffer gas atoms and cell walls , diffusion out of the laser beam , and residual magnetic field gradients .",
    "modeling the atomic medium as a collection of stationary three - level @xmath0-systems ( fig .",
    "[ levelsandsetup]a ) , we find that slow and stored light properties improve with increasing rubidium density or optical depth .",
    "the eit bandwidth , @xmath1 , for moderate to large optical depths is found to be  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the rabi frequency of the control field , @xmath4 the excited - state line width , @xmath5 the total number of three - level atoms , @xmath6 the length of the medium ( the optical depth , @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 the light - atom coupling coefficient , and @xmath9 the speed of light . similarly , the group velocity @xmath10 resulting from the steep resonant dispersion for the signal pulse in the slow light medium is  @xcite @xmath11 the absolute pulse delay , @xmath12 , is then given by the length of the medium divided by the group velocity and we find that @xmath13 , that is the delay is proportional to the optical depth .",
    "a careful theoretical study of storage efficiency @xmath14 ( defined as the ratio of the number of output photons to the number of input photons ) , optimized for a given optical depth  @xcite , finds that the optimal temporal pulse width @xmath15 , and finds that @xmath14 scales as @xmath16 at high optical depth , and increases more rapidly at lower @xmath17 .",
    "this treatment implies continued efficiency improvement with increasing optical depth . in practice",
    ", experiments have found that slow and stored light efficiency improves with increasing optical depth for modest optical depths . however , at larger optical depths , slow and stored light efficiency reach a maximum and then degrade .",
    "note that a procedure for optimizing stored light efficiency for a given @xmath17 , using the time - reversed output pulse to determine the shape of the input pulse , has been developed theoretically  @xcite and directly implemented experimentally  @xcite .    in the present study",
    "we report preliminary experimental investigations of the behavior of slow and stored light over a wide range of optical depths , by varying the temperature of rb in a vapor cell .",
    "measuring coherence loss rates and including them in the efficiency optimization model yields good agreement between theory and experiment as @xmath14 falls off with increasing atomic density .",
    "we focus on the role played by optical depth in coherence loss , in particular the effect of radiation trapping , where incoherent photons are repeatedly re - absorbed by the medium before exiting  @xcite .",
    "we also report promising preliminary efficiency results for a new cell geometry designed to reduce coherence loss due to radiation trapping .",
    "we measured eit and slow and stored light , using the @xmath18 transition in a warm @xmath19rb vapor .",
    "the relevant energy levels and coupling fields are shown in fig .",
    "[ levelsandsetup]a : a strong control field is resonant with the @xmath20 transition and a weak signal field is resonant with @xmath21 .",
    "the optical fields were generated by an external cavity diode laser tuned to @xmath22  nm , amplified by a tapered amplifier , and spatially filtered by a pinhole ( fig .",
    "[ levelsandsetup]b ) .",
    "an electro - optic modulator ( eom ) phase modulated the laser at the ground state hyperfine splitting ( @xmath23  ghz ) ; the @xmath24 sideband acted as the signal field , with a maximum signal to control intensity ratio of @xmath25 ; the sideband amplitude was varied to shape the desired signal pulse .",
    "the frequency could be varied to change the two - photon detuning @xmath26 of the eit transition for measuring its line shape .",
    "the overall intensity was regulated with an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) , which also shifted the frequency by @xmath27  mhz . a quarter - wave plate ( @xmath28 ) before the cell converted the beam to circular polarization .",
    "the collimated beam entering the cell had a diameter of approximately @xmath29  mm .",
    "the output fields were measured by sending the laser into an optical fiber , then into a fast photodetector ( pd ) along with a reference beam picked off prior to the eom and aom . the control field , signal field , or the unused @xmath30 sideband",
    "could thus be measured by beat note detection with a spectrum analyzer , at @xmath31  mhz , @xmath32  ghz  @xmath33  mhz , and @xmath32  ghz@xmath34  mhz respectively .",
    "the transmission of the @xmath30 sideband ( off eit resonance ) , which is @xmath35  ghz away from any rb resonance , was used as a reference for determining slow light delay or storage efficiency , where @xmath36 was the difference between pulse peak times and efficiency @xmath37  ( signal pulse area)/(@xmath30 sideband area ) .",
    "the cell was housed in a plastic oven , which was heated by blown warm air .",
    "the cell temperature was varied between @xmath38 and @xmath39c , or atomic number density between @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "three layers of cylindrical high - permeability shielding surrounded the oven to screen out stray laboratory magnetic fields , and a solenoid inside was used to cancel any small constant background field .",
    "three rb vapor cells were used in our experiments ; all three contained isotopically enriched @xmath19rb and were filled with buffer gas to confine atoms and extend their coherence life times . the cell used for all measurements except where specifically noted had length @xmath43  cm and diameter @xmath44  cm , and was filled with @xmath38  torr of ne .",
    "we studied slow and stored light as a function of optical depth by measuring the delay - bandwidth product and efficiency of `` optimized '' pulses as the vapor cell temperature was varied .",
    "such pulses were constructed through an iterative optimization procedure in which a signal pulse was stored and retrieved , its output shape measured and a new pulse stored with the shape of the output pulse .",
    "this process is repeated until convergence .",
    "this procedure has been shown both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite to produce slow - light pulse shapes that optimize storage efficiency for the given optical depth and laser power . in effect",
    "this procedure selects a pulse bandwidth that balances fractional delay and absorption to yield the largest output signal pulse .",
    "measured eit bandwidths and slow light delays scaled as expected with optical depth .",
    "figure [ eitanddelays]a shows eit linewidth ( fwhm , as extracted from a lorentzian fit ) vs. atomic density , which follows the @xmath45 trending expected from eq .  [ e.eitwidth ] .",
    "figure  [ eitanddelays]b shows that absolute pulse delay @xmath46 ; and figure  [ eitanddelays]c shows that the optimal pulse width @xmath47 .",
    "we measured line widths and delays at two control field powers , @xmath48  mw and @xmath49  mw , corresponding to respective intensities of @xmath50 and @xmath51  mw/@xmath52 and rabi frequencies of @xmath53 and @xmath50  mhz .",
    "slow light delays in figs .",
    "[ eitanddelays]b and [ eitanddelays]c are tailored for optimized stored light , obtaining neither the maximum absolute delay ( achieved for a temporally long pulse experiencing only the steepest part of the dispersion , but having a small fraction of the pulse in the medium at one time ) nor the maximum fractional delay ( achieved for a temporally short pulse which suffers large absorption due to frequency components outside the eit bandwidth ) . comparing the optimized pulse bandwidth ( where @xmath54 is the temporal pulse width ) to the measured eit bandwidth ( fig .",
    "[ eitanddelays]d ) , we find that @xmath55 , over a large range of fractional delays ( from @xmath56 to @xmath57 ) , a somewhat greater pulse bandwidth than expected theoretically  @xcite , where @xmath58 or even @xmath59 .",
    "note that based on the scalings of @xmath60 and @xmath15 , we would expect the optimal frequency bandwidth to be quadratic in the eit line width which is not clearly observed in fig .",

    "dashed lines are fits of data to the simplified three - level model described in text . ]",
    "stored light efficiency was measured for a range of rubidium densities between @xmath62 @xmath42 ( @xmath63c ) and @xmath64 @xmath42 ( @xmath39c ) and storage intervals from @xmath65s to @xmath66  ms and plotted for @xmath67s in fig .",

    "the efficiencies peak at temperatures between @xmath68 and @xmath69c , falling at higher optical depth .",
    "the @xmath70 coherence lifetimes during storage ( fig .",
    "[ oneoveretimes ] ) also fall at high density .",
    "this points to possible high - density or high - temperature phenomena adversely affecting slow and stored light .",
    "increased loss during storage and readout at high optical depth agrees with predictions from theoretical simulations when the density dependence of decoherence is included ( fig .",
    "[ theoryexp ] ) .",
    "the simulations , described fully in earlier work  @xcite , consist of iterated solutions to the stored light dynamics equations for an ensemble @xmath0-system . the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ theoryexp ] uses the measured rates of decoherence during storage and readout taken from fig .",
    "[ oneoveretimes ] as an input parameter for the spin - wave decay rate , and most closely matches the experimental results .    in figure  [ accounting ]",
    "we verify that the loss mechanisms for stored light are all self - consistent . a slow light pulse that is not trapped in the medium ( the control field",
    "is left on ) has loss from imperfect eit transmission and from pulse bandwidth lying outside the region of maximum transmission ( after normalization to a reference pulse , this is the `` slow - light efficiency '' ) .",
    "a stored and retrieved pulse will experience that same loss , and additional loss from two sources : ( i ) part of the pulse escapes the medium before the pulse is stored ( fractional delay less than unity implies significant losses from this mechanism ) ; and ( ii ) atomic coherence decay during the storage and readout periods .",
    "figure [ accounting]a shows the directly measured slow light efficiency @xmath71 , the area ratio of the output pulse to the reference pulse , and an inferred @xmath72 from the storage measurement . using the measured decoherence rate from fig .",
    "[ oneoveretimes ] and the storage readout areas at @xmath67s , we can back out the storage readout at @xmath73 ; combining this with the area of the not - stored pulse leakage we infer @xmath71 ( see fig .",
    "[ accounting]b ) : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the leaked pulse area divided by the reference pulse area , and @xmath76 is the atomic coherence lifetime from fig .",
    "[ oneoveretimes ] .",
    "the measured and inferred slow light efficiencies match very well , only deviating significantly at the highest atomic density , where the term with exp@xmath77s@xmath78 becomes very sensitive to the short coherence lifetime measurement , which is more error prone due to the low snr in the signal transmission .    as indicated from both the storage efficiency and the comparison between slow and stored light , at high rb densities the effectiveness of the medium",
    "is reduced .",
    "we believe that several mechanisms are responsible for this .",
    "first , at higher densities , temperature or density - dependent losses such as rb - rb spin exchange become more significant , contributing to decoherence even during the storage interval ( see fig .",
    "[ oneoveretimes ] ) .",
    "second , in the presence of light at high rb densities , radiation trapping becomes significant : light absorbed and then incoherently radiated by one rubidium atom is reabsorbed by another rubidium atom , and this process leads to decoherence and loss of efficiency .",
    "in the next sections , we present preliminary investigations of high - density losses .",
    "direct measurements of large optical depths are difficult due to the large corresponding absorption of the optical field .",
    "to characterize the optical depth for comparison with the optimization models described above , we used optical absorption line width as a proxy for the optical depth .",
    "the signal field was detuned from two - photon resonance by changing the frequency driving the eom and the signal intensity monitored as the one - photon ( laser ) detuning was swept through resonance .",
    "the line width of the signal field absorption serves as a proxy for the optical depth because the logarithm of the measured absorption is proportional to the product of the detuning and the optical depth .",
    "figure  [ radtrap]a shows a comparison of the measured one - photon linewidth and the expected linewidth from a simple numerical model based on an optically thick sample of three - level @xmath0-systems . at high densities ( and optical depths ) , the measured linewidth stops growing while the model shows continued line broadening .",
    "we attribute this to radiation trapping : photons scattered inside the medium depolarize the rubidium ground state .",
    "fewer atoms are polarized in the signal field channel , leading to bothdecoherence and absorption of the signal field .",
    "we also directly measured the presence of radiation trapping in our vapor cells , with a simplified apparatus .",
    "light from an extended cavity diode laser was focused through an aom with a small spot size to allow for rapid rise times in the aom .",
    "this aom output was turned on and off at a rate of @xmath79  mhz with a rise time of @xmath80 ns .",
    "the beam diameter was then expanded to approximately @xmath81  mm and sent into a rb vapor cell housed inside a small plastic oven , unshielded from stray laboratory magnetic fields , and warmed with resistive heaters to temperatures between @xmath82 and @xmath83c .",
    "output light from the cell was measured with two photodetectors : one for transmission , and the other for fluorescence mounted to the side of the cell oven where a lens close to the cell focused scattered light onto the detector . when light was turned on via aom modulation , the rise time of the signal was observed in both detectors .",
    "evidence for radiation trapping is shown in fig .  [ radtrap]b . at high atomic densities , the rise time in the fluorescence",
    "detection signal increases significantly .",
    "the greater the transverse optical depth , the greater the number of absorption and re - emission cycles that occur before absorbed photons exit the medium , so the rise time seen in fluorescence detection should grow with the transverse optical depth . in fig .",
    "[ radtrap]b we see rise times up to @xmath84  ns , whereas the lifetime for the excited state of the @xmath85 state of rb is @xmath86  ns , indicating many scattering events for each absorbed photon .",
    "in order to minimize the decoherence resulting from radiation trapping in our vapor cells , we recently developed a cell designed to minimize its effects .",
    "a 15 cm long , 1.2 cm diameter cell with n@xmath87 buffer gas was designed to reduce radiation trapping in three ways : ( i ) the aspect ratio is four times larger than previous cells , allowing fluorescence to escape the cell in the transverse direction with fewer depolarizing interactions with rb atoms ; ( ii ) the absolute length of the cell is twice that of previous vapor cells allowing the equivalent optical depth to be reached at lower rb density , minimizing density - dependent effects , including spin exchange ; ( iii ) n@xmath87 buffer gas acts to quench radiation trapping by collisionally de - exciting rb atoms before the atoms fluoresce , preventing the emission of unpolarized photons that could destroy the coherence of nearby atoms .",
    "initial results of stored light efficiency in this cell appear promising . for a laser power of @xmath88  mw and a temperature of @xmath89c ( the same longitudinal optical depth as the density @xmath90  @xmath42 data in fig .",
    "[ theoryexp ] ) , efficiency of @xmath91 was achieved .",
    "this is three times greater than the @xmath14 for @xmath92  mw and twice as great as for @xmath93  mw at the same optical depth .",
    "future measurements will further explore this promising avenue towards high - efficiency light storage in rb vapor cells .",
    "we reported a preliminary experimental study of slow and stored light at a variety of rb densities ( i.e. , optical depths ) , and as a function of pulse duration , delay and storage time , and control field intensity .",
    "experimental results are in good qualitative agreement with theoretical calculations based on a simplified three - level model at moderate densities ; and indicate that radiation trapping is an important limitation at high atomic density .",
    "we have developed a new cell geometry which we expect to reduce losses and improve efficiency through reduced radiation trapping and density - dependent decoherence .",
