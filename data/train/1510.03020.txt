    "new classes of materials with extraordinary band structure including graphene @xcite , topological insulators @xcite , and weyl semimetals ( wsms ) @xcite have attracted a great deal of interest both from the fundamental point of view and potential applications .",
    "recently , some experiments revealed wsm phase in several chemical compounds @xcite and photonic crystals @xcite . in the context of optical lattices ,",
    "some schemes to realize wsm phase have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "wsms have a novel nontrivial topological electronic states in their band structure .",
    "they possess gapless bulk and fermi arc surface states , in contrast to the topological insulators which have gapless surface state inside the bulk gapped states . in wsms which are three - dimensional ( 3d ) extension of graphene s low - energy spectrum , carriers resemble the weyl fermions around the so - called weyl point where the conduction and valence bands touch each other .    in the absence of either time - reversal or parity symmetry ,",
    "dirac points split into pairs of weyl points in the brillouin zone with opposite chirality @xcite in wsms .",
    "time - reversal breaking case can be implemented by magnetic doping either in the bulk @xcite or on the surface @xcite of topological insulators .",
    "inversion symmetry breaking can be achieved by using an electric field @xcite , staggered strain @xcite , alloying or application of external pressure @xcite .",
    "remarkably , recently , the wsm has been studied in the nonmagnetic materials taas @xcite , nbas @xcite and tap @xcite without breaking of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "different non - doubly degenerate stable chiral states along with 3d relativistic nature of wsms make a good playground to reach exotic phenomena such as the chiral anomaly @xcite , anomalous hall effects @xcite , and unconventional superconductivity @xcite .",
    "due to recent development of new materials with non - trivial topology , the investigation of indirect exchange interactions between magnetic impurities through carriers of a host material , known as the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction  @xcite , has become an interesting issue .",
    "non - trivial electronic states of carriers along with dimensions of space containing itinerant carriers result in an interesting behavior of the rkky interaction between magnetic spins in graphene @xcite , topological insulators @xcite , transition - metal dichalcogenides @xcite and silicene @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned features of wsms would provide an important effect on the interaction of dilute impurities located inside these materials with the itinerant weyl fermions . in this context",
    ", it is interesting to know how 3d feature and non - doubly degenerate dirac dispersion relation emerging from the band structure , may affect the indirect exchange interaction between magnetic impurities in the wsm .",
    "in previous works , most of the studies have been focused on the ordering of host magnetic components @xcite , kondo effect @xcite of dilute magnetic impurities and the influence of surface @xcite or bulk @xcite states on density responses due to non - magnetic impurities in the wsm phase .",
    "however , the rkky interaction between magnetic impurities in the wsm has remained unexplored so far .    in this paper , using the green s function method and employing an effective two - band model , we address bulk properties of the rkky interaction between two magnetic impurities in the wsm that is characterized by a pair of weyl points separated in momentum space .",
    "it is found that four terms , which include the heisenberg , dzyaloshinsky - moriya , spin - frustrated , and ising couplings , contribute to magnetic spin interactions .",
    "impurity spin components of the dzyaloshinsky - moriya and spin - frustrated interactions lie in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the line joining the two weyl points , but the ising interaction has only spin components in the direction parallel to the line connecting two weyl points . while the range function of the ising interaction vanishes in the direction perpendicular to the line connecting the weyl points ,",
    "the range functions of other terms survive in this direction .",
    "furthermore , we also demonstrate that the spatial dependence of the range functions fall off as @xmath0 @xmath1 for zero ( finite ) fermi energy and show a beating behavior depending on the direction between two magnetic impurities .    .",
    "the figure also shows linearly dispersing excitation spectrum around a pair of weyl points separated by a distance 2@xmath2 in the @xmath3-direction of momentum space.,width=219 ]",
    "we consider a 3d wsm with a pair of weyl points separated in the brillouin zone containing two magnetic impurities , as shown schematically in fig . [ wsm ] .",
    "the strength of the magnetic impurities is supposed to be weak enough to keep linearly dispersing bands @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian describing the weyl fermions is given by @xcite , @xmath4 with @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the weyl spinor , @xmath7 represents the pair of weyl points with opposite chirality which are located at @xmath8 in momentum space , @xmath9 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath10 are the pauli matrices for the spin degree of freedom .",
    "we assume that the magnetic impurities are embedded inside the wsm such that the effect of fermi arc surface states can be neglected . as a result of this assumption ,",
    "the bulk states provide the main contribution to the indirect exchange interaction .",
    "the interaction of the spin of magnetic impurities with the weyl fermions of host material can be described by a contact interaction , @xmath11 where @xmath12 indicates the spin density for weyl fermion at position coordinate @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 is the localized impurity spin at site @xmath16 . for simplicity and concreteness , here , we suppose that the exchange coupling @xmath17 is isotropic for each component of impurities spin and homogeneous throughout the wsm and also , the first impurity is situated on the origin",
    "@xmath18 = @xmath19 .    treating @xmath20 as a perturbation to @xmath21 , at second order of perturbation",

    ", one can use either the cut - off procedure @xcite or matsubara green s functions in the coordinate - imaginary time representation @xcite .",

    "we note that there is no dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath61 in eqs .",
    "( [ dlrange1])-([dlrange4 ] ) .",
    "this arises as a consequence of the azimuthal symmetry around a pair of weyl dispersions .",
    "the resulting rkky interaction [ see eq . ( [ finalhrkky ] ) ] consists of four different terms : the heisenberg term , the dzyaloshinsky - moriya term , the spin - frustrated term and the ising term , whose range functions are @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "notice that magnetic spins of both the dzyaloshinsky - moriya and the spin - frustrated terms have no components in the direction parallel to the line connecting the weyl points .",
    "therefore , the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction favor twisted impurity spin structure in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the weyl points , whereas the spin - frustrated interaction causes ( anti ) parallel alignment of the impurity spins along the projection of the line joining the two magnetic impurities on this plane .",
    "the ising term describes antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ordering , depending on its sign , between the components of impurity spins pointing from one weyl point to the other one . while both the spin - frustrated and the ising terms have the same prefactors with positive sign , the heisenberg and the dzyaloshinsky - moria terms have the smallest and the largest perfactors with negative and positive signs , respectively .    at weyl points , @xmath66 , all the range functions [ eqs .",
    "( [ rangef1 ] ) - ( [ rangef4 ] ) ] show a decaying behavior with the spatial dependence as @xmath0 similar to that previously found in carbon nanotubes with center - adsorbed impurities @xcite . this behavior can be described based on semiclassical arguments @xcite which for any d - dimensional material with density of states @xmath67 at fermi energy , the rkky interaction decays at large distances with a power law decay @xmath68 . since , for a 3d wsm ( @xmath69 ) at weyl points , the density of states decreases with a power @xmath70 , indeed",
    ", one can obtain the power law decay @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , for finite fermi energy and at large distances , @xmath71 , the range functions can be approximated by , @xmath72,\\\\ f_2 & \\approx & \\frac{32\\pi^3j^2\\epsilon^2_f\\cos^2(2\\gamma)}{\\omega^2_{bz}v^3_0r^3}\\cos^2(qz),\\\\ f_3 & \\approx & -\\frac{32\\pi^3j^2\\epsilon^2_f\\cos^2(2\\gamma)}{\\omega^2_{bz}v^3_0r^3}\\cos^2(qz),\\\\ f_4 & \\approx & -\\frac{32\\pi^3j^2\\epsilon^2_f\\cos^2(2\\gamma)}{\\omega^2_{bz}v^3_0r^3}\\sin^2(qz)\\cos^2(\\theta_r),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which show the power law decay @xmath73 .",
    "consequently , in the wsm phase , the range functions are rather short - range and fall off faster than those of the doped ( undoped ) graphene @xcite , doped ( undoped ) topological insulators @xcite , 2d electron gas systems @xcite and monolayer transition - metal dichalcogenides @xcite which slowly decay as @xmath74 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "moreover , due to momenta - shift of the pair of weyl points in the wsm phase , the dimensionless couplings @xmath75 s depend on the direction between two magnetic impurities which is similar to the results obtained in graphene @xcite , monolayer transition - metal dichalcogenides @xcite and silicene @xcite .",
    "however , there is a key difference from these materials . in graphene ,",
    "the direction dependence of couplings is identical up to an additional phase factor @xcite , also the direction dependence of all couplings is not identical in monolayer transition - metal dichalcogenides @xcite and silicene @xcite .",
    "but , obviously , in the wsm case , the dependence of the dimensionless couplings @xmath76 and @xmath77 on direction is the same , while @xmath78 and @xmath79 have different direction dependence which can be associated to the opposite chirality of the pair of weyl points along with 3d nature of wsm .",
    "interestingly , if both impurities place on the plane perpendicular to the line connecting two weyl points , @xmath80 , the range function of ising term vanishes , @xmath81 . also , for undoped case , @xmath66 , unlike the other couplings , the dzyaloshinsky - moria term vanishes @xcite regardless of direction and distance between impurities .",
    "s as a function of the dimensionless fermi energy ( @xmath82 ) for @xmath83 and @xmath84.,width=264 ]",
    "in our considerations , we choose @xmath85 as the length unit and @xmath86 as the energy unit . in fig .",
    "[ iferteta ] , the dependence of the dimensionless couplings @xmath75 s on the fermi energy is shown for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "one can see that all the @xmath75 s oscillate and their amplitudes increase with increasing dimensionless fermi energy @xmath82 , because of increasing the fermi surface of the system .",
    "furthermore , we observe clearly that while @xmath78 , @xmath77 and @xmath79 in terms of @xmath26 are in - phase , @xmath76 has a phase shift with respect to the others .",
    "the dimensionless couplings @xmath75 s versus @xmath87 strongly modulate as depicted in fig .",
    "[ iteta ] .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) refer to the cases @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , with @xmath90 indicating that the number of oscillations depend on the value of dimensionless distance @xmath91 and increase at large value of @xmath91 . moreover , from eqs .",
    "( [ dlrange1 ] ) - ( [ dlrange4 ] ) , it is easy to see that the maxima of these oscillations for the dimensionless couplings @xmath78 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( @xmath79 ) take place at certain angles @xmath92 $ ] ( @xmath93 $ ] ) with @xmath94 .",
    "we note that while @xmath78 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 have finite values of amplitude modulation around the plane perpendicular to the line connecting two weyl points , @xmath80 , as mentioned above , the values of @xmath79 become vanishingly small around such angle .",

    "figure [ ir](a ) shows that @xmath78 increases oscillatory with respect to @xmath91 in the @xmath95 direction .",
    "but for @xmath98 , @xmath78 exhibits a beating behavior as one can see in fig .",
    "[ ir](b ) . in this case",
    ", the upper and lower envelope functions increase oscillatory in magnitude without crossing points between them , indicating that superposed carriers waves have different amplitudes . as illustrated in figs .",

    "[ ir](g)-(h ) for @xmath79 ) , the dimensionless couplings almost always show a beating behavior as functions of dimensionless distance @xmath91 with crossing points between the upper and lower envelope functions .",
    "it is interesting to note that in all the cases discussed above the beat period increases as we increase @xmath87 from @xmath99 up to @xmath80 . with further increase of the @xmath87 ,",
    "the situation reverses and the beat period decreases ( not shown here ) , thus , as a consequence , the plane @xmath80 acts as a mirror plane .",
    "finally , it should be remarked that although we have considered indirect exchange interaction in the wsm phase with a pair of weyl points separated in momentum space along the @xmath3-direction but our calculation can be extended directly to cases with multiple sets of weyl nodes in the brillouin zone with arbitrary direction between them as well .",
    "also , wsm phase has not been yet experimentally reported by breaking of time - reversal symmetry , but there are some materials such as taas @xcite , nbas @xcite and tap @xcite that have been recently found to exhibit 3d weyl fermion states with time - reversal - symmetric feature .",
    "we believe that such materials are promising candidates to explore the rkky interaction between magnetic impurities in wsms .",
    "in this paper , we studied the rkky interaction between magnetic impurities mediated by the bulk states of wsm within the two - band model and found that the 3d character of wsm with opposite chirality of weyl points provides a unique feature which is absent in the 2d counterpart materials .",
    "we showed that the rkky interaction can be decomposed as the heisenberg , the dzyaloshinsky - moriya , the spin - frustrated and the ising terms .",
    "for each term an analytic formula is derived that decays as the power law of @xmath0 at weyl points and shows the beating behavior depending on the impurities orientations .",
    "the magnitude of the range functions remains finite in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the two weyl points , except for the case of the ising interaction .",
    "furthermore , the spins of magnetic impurities in the dzyaloshinsky - moriya and spin - frustrated interactions have no components in the direction parallel to the line connecting two weyl points , but the ising interaction has only spin components in such direction .    _ note added_ after completion of the present paper we became aware that the same issue has been investigated in ref .",
