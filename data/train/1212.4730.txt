    "there are many similarities between electromagnetic ( e&m ) radiation and gravitational radiation : both travel at the speed of light ; both carry energy away from their sources ; both consist of transverse waves with two polarizations . in addition ,",
    "einstein s general relativity , the theoretical underpinning of gravitational waves , can be put into a form remarkably parallel to maxwell s electrodynamics , the theoretical underpinning of e&m  waves . despite the many similarities ,",
    "there are important differences , and focusing on those differences helps to give a deeper understanding of both kinds of radiation",
    ".    our mechanism for exploring those differences will be the visualization of the fields .",
    "visualization of e&m  field lines has proven very helpful to student understanding @xcite .",
    "the visualization of gravitational fields has been a challenge , but the recently developed technique of using `` tendex '' and `` vortex '' lines@xcite provides insights that may be of pedagogical value comparable to the plotting of electric or magnetic field lines in e&m .",
    "both in e&m  and in gravitation , the dynamic nature of radiation fields is of central importance to visualization , and in both e&m  and gravitation , waves carries energy . in e&m",
    "it will turn out that a definite meaning can be given to the motion of field lines and to the transport of energy .",
    "by contrast , in the gravitational case , a definite meaning can not be given to either of these concepts .",
    "this will help us understand some important ways in which gravitation fundamentally differs from e&m .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "a few words are in order about the choices that have been made for notation and conventions .",
    "the principle has been to produce a paper that can be understood by a reader with a minimum of mathematical preliminaries . to that end",
    "we have avoided certain practices that are common in advanced literature .",
    "the following points deserve particular notice .",
    "( i )  papers involving relativity typically assume units in which the @xmath1 , the speed of light , is taken to be unity . in order to have expressions",
    "in which the dimensionality of quantities is more transparent , we do not make that choice ; all factors of @xmath1 explicitly appear .",
    "( ii )  it is common to use the `` einstein summation convention , '' in which summation is assumed for any repeated index .",
    "adopting this convention would allow us to drop the explicit summation symbols in eq .",
    "( [ lorentzforce ] ) and many subsequent equations .",
    "we have chosen , however , to have these summation symbols appear .",
    "( iii )  to avoid the mathematical baggage of covariant differentiation we have been explicit in using only cartesian coordinates and cartesian components where expressions involve differentiation , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : emcartcomps ] ) .",
    "( iv )  we avoid `` coordinate bases '' that are commonly used in computations with tensor fields . rather , the components expressed , e.g. , in eq .",
    "( [ staticcale ] ) , are with respect to the familiar spherical coordinate orthonormal basis , not the coordinate basis .",
    "one of the simplifications following from this choice is that indices on components are the same whether they are superscripts or subscripts ; their location is chosen for convenience .",
    "for comparison with the gravitational case , it is useful for us to mention the very roots of electromagnetic physics .",
    "the electric field @xmath2 and magnetic field @xmath3 are defined through the expression for the acceleration * a * due to the total electromagnetic force , the lorentz force , acting on a point particle of mass @xmath4 and charge @xmath5 , moving at velocity * v*,@xcite @xmath6 the fields obey the maxwell equations , which in rationalized mks units , take the form @xmath7 @xmath8 here we have simplified the equations by assuming that they apply in a region devoid of sources and of material properties , i.e. , we take the charge and current density to be zero , and we assume vacuum values of the dielectric constant and magnetic permeability",
    ". it will be useful to rewrite these equations in component form ( in which we assume a cartesian basis ) : @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    here the summations are over the indices of the cartesian components and coordinates , @xmath12 , or @xmath13 .",
    "the symbol @xmath14 is the three - dimensional alternating symbol used in the construction of determinants and cross products .",
    "it vanishes if any of its indices is repeated ( e.g. , @xmath15 ) , equals + 1 for any even permutation of 1,2,3 , or @xmath16 , ( i.e. , @xmath17 , ) , and equals -1 for any odd permutation ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) .",
    "the simplest solutions of the maxwell equations are the time independent solutions , especially the point multipole ( point charge , dipole , quadrupole ... ) solutions for electrostatic or magnetostatic fields . of greatest interest in this paper",
    "will be the not - so - simple radiation solutions in which time variation is essential .",
    "of considerable importance to these radiation solutions is the poynting vector , the flux of electromagnetic power per unit cross sectional area @xmath19    in a general treatment , the computation of the radiation produced by a given distribution of time - changing charges and currents leads to retarded integrals over those sources . here",
    ", however , we are primarily interested in the description and visualization of the resulting fields , so we simply invoke radiation fields without being specific about the internal details of their source . for such purposes",
    "the choice usually made is that of a point dipole , but for our purpose here this choice has the disadvantage that it has no gravitational analog .",
    "the lowest order multipole for gravitational radiation is the quadrupole@xcite . accordingly , as our example of an electromagnetic radiating source we choose a point quadrupole , and we make the description and visualization as simple as possible by taking the quadrupole to be axisymmetric .      to understand what is meant by `` gravitation '' in relativistic theories it is best to start with the simplest case , gravitostatics , gravitation for static configurations . in this case , if the gravitational fields are typically weak ( if they do not drive particles to speeds comparable to @xmath1 ) then newtonian ideas can be adopted , with minor modification , to relativistic gravitation . by `` gravitational field , '' in this approach ,",
    "we do not mean , e.g. , the downward acceleration at 9.8m / sec@xmath20 near the surface of the earth . more generally , if @xmath21 is the usual newtonian potential , @xmath22 is not considered `` true '' gravitation .",
    "since it affects all particles identically , its effects on particles undergoing their natural , freely falling motion disappear in a freely falling frame , the inertial frame in the relativistic view of spacetime .",
    "gravitation , in the relativistic viewpoint , is the way in which the the natural free - fall motions vary from place to place and time to time . in a static configuration , one",
    "in which there is no change from time to time , the information is contained in the way in which @xmath22 varies from place to place .",
    "the rate of variation of a vector is a tensor , in the case of @xmath22 it is often called the gravitoelectric field@xcite .",
    "( because this tensor describes the raising of tides on astrophysical objects in a newtonian setting it is also called the tidal tensor . ) in a cartesian basis the content of this tensor is the set of tensor components@xcite @xmath23 the trace of this gravitoelectric tensor is a familiar quantity @xmath24 just as the electric field is divergenceless outside sources , the gravitoelectric field is traceless outside sources .    the definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : traceekk ] ) is valid even in the presence of sources . in that case",
    "the right hand side has the familiar value @xmath25 times mass density .",
    "this equation , then , is analogous to coulomb s law for electromagnetism .",
    "it gives a definition of the field in terms of its sources , but only for a static field . to deal with radiation",
    "we need more general definitions , definitions based on the manifestations , the physical effects , of these fields . in the case of electromagnetism",
    ", this more general definition is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : loraccel ] ) or , equivalently , eq .  ( [ lorentzforce ] ) . in relativistic gravitation there is no concept of force _ per se_.",
    "rather , the manifestations of gravity are seen in the effects on two point particles separated by a small displacement @xmath26 , and with a relative velocity @xmath27 .",
    "the relative acceleration of the two particles , given by@xcite @xmath28 defines the tensors @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the similarity to the lorentz acceleration in eq .",
    "( [ lorentzforce ] ) is striking , especially if one considers @xmath31 and @xmath32 to be vectors .",
    "there are , of course , differences of detail , one of which is very fundamental . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : loraccel ] ) , or ( [ lorentzforce ] ) , the factor @xmath33 describes the special features of the particle undergoing electromagnetic acceleration .",
    "by contrast , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodev ] ) there is no reference to any characteristic of the particles . in accordance with the so - called `` equivalence principle , '' gravitation acts in the same way on any particle .    the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodev ] ) are symmetric ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) . outside sources",
    "these fields are traceless ( @xmath36=@xmath37=0 ) and obey the maxwell - like relations@xcite @xmath38 @xmath39 which can be written as @xmath40 with appropriate interpretation of the divergence and curl .",
    "note that the divergence can be taken on either index ( since the `` gravito- '' tensors are symmetric ) and the curl in these equations is symmetrized@xcite .",
    "two `` theoretical '' points bear mentioning : ( i ) just as the six independent components of @xmath2 and @xmath3 contain a complete description of the electromagnetic field at a point , the ten independent components of the two symmetric traceless tensors @xmath29 and @xmath30 contain a complete description of the gravitational field at a point .",
    "( ii ) the vectors @xmath2 and @xmath3 are `` gauge invariant . ''",
    "they can not , for instance , be made to vanish by a mathematical choice . in the same sense @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "are gauge invariant@xcite .",
    "this is the mathematical equivalent of the physical statement that these quantities are directly physically measurable .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are vector fields , and hence in principle are simple to picture .",
    "one can use small arrows indicating field direction , with arrow length indicating vector magnitude .",
    "alternatively one can sketch field lines , curves to which the vectors are tangent , with the density of these lines indicating the strength of the field .",
    "the limitations of spatial resolution in these methods are well known . below we will be illustrating vector and line fields with a more modern technique : the line integral convolution ( lic ) method of cabral and leedom@xcite . in this method",

    "the electric _ field _ produced by that source is the vector field * e*.    the model in fig .",

    "we shrink @xmath48 to zero , while keeping finite the product @xmath49 .",
    "the result is a point source with only a quadrupole moment .    ]",
    "the static electric field for the point quadrupole is most simply computed from the electrostatic potential .",
    "a formal procedure@xcite can be used to find the potential directly from the quadrupole components in eq .",
    "( [ quadeleccomps ] ) , or a limiting procedure can be applied to the potential of the three point charges in fig .",

    "[ fig : elecstatquad ] . for this static electric configuration , there are no associated magnetic fields .",
    "the problem of visualizing the @xmath53 and @xmath54 fields is a special example of the question : how does one visualize tensorial fields .",
    "the `` gravito- '' fields , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , are tensors , but at least they are the simplest nontrivial type of 3-dimensional tensor : they are second rank ( two index ) symmetric tensors . in this sense",
    "they are similar to the most familiar tensors of physics : the inertia tensor , the stress tensor , the dielectric tensor of an anisotropic material , etc .    in the case of a tensor like the inertia tensor of an extended massive object ,",
    "a reasonable visualization is the inertia ellipsoid , a three dimensional ellipsoid whose shape shows the directions and size of the principal axes of the moment of inertia of the massive object@xcite .",
    "this ellipsoid for a second - rank symmetric tensor is very much the analog of the arrow for a vector .",
    "the moment of inertia ellipsoid describes a single tensor , not a tensor field .",
    "while a display of space filled with arrows has some usefulness for the visualization of a vector field , the same is probably not true of space filled with ellipsoids .",
    "but , just as arrows can be connected together to form field lines , the _ principal axes _ of tensorial ellipsoids can be connected to form a network of lines with visualization properties somewhat similar to field lines . the specific technique for visualization of a symmetric tensor",
    "@xmath55 is to find , at each point in space , the principal directions , i.e. , the vectors @xmath56 satisfying the eigenvector condition @xmath57 . if @xmath55 is symmetric we are guaranteed that three such eigenvectors exist and are orthogonal .",
    "the three orthogonal sets of lines connecting these eigenvectors , the `` eigenlines '' for these eigenvectors then give us visual information about our tensor field .",
    "this method has been used for some time in the visualization of stress ( a tensor quantity ) in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics@xcite , and has recently been suggested for use in visualizing the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields@xcite .",
    "those advocating the application to gravitation give the name `` vortex '' lines to the eigenvectors of @xmath30 due to the role of that field in driving the precession of spin .",
    "the eigenvector field lines of @xmath29 are given the name `` tendex '' lines , suggestive of the role of the tidal distortions associated with @xmath29 .",

    "it turns out that there is a reasonable criterion for tagging field lines .",
    "at least in the case of axisymmetric sources , the mathematical nature of maxwell s equations imposes these tags in a natural way .",

    "this fundamental problem turns out not to be a barrier if we only want to show the qualitative nature of the field pattern motions in gravitation .",
    "intuitively useful flow fields can be guessed at qualitatively due to the existence of singularities .    in plots of lines",
    "tangent to vector fields , the singularities are points at which the vector has zero magnitude , so that the direction of a tangent line is undefined . in fig .",
    "[ fig : emradquad ] , such points can be seen both in the equatorial plane and along the symmetry axis .",

    "different choices of the details of how they are drawn make no difference in the qualitative content of the images .",

    "[ fig : licgsnapshot ] are richer in singularities than the electromagnetic vector fields shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emradquad ] .",
    "in addition to `` stagnation points , '' the eigenlines contain line singularities in the equatorial plane . in sequences of lic snapshots the motion of these singularities , and the understanding that they `` drag '' the field lines , give approximate meaning to the evolution of the eigenlines .",
    "such qualitative visual flow fields could be used in making the movies , i.e. , sequences of lic snapshots , that have been made available online@xcite .",
    "however , we chose not to do that even qualitatively , and have taken the underlying flow field to be zero in those movies .",
    "the eye of the observer provides a concept of motion in any case , and we felt that it would be overinterpretation to try to augment that perception by imposing a qualitative flow pattern that matches it .",
    "therefore we do not evolve the underlying pattern at all in the gravitational radiations movies online .",
    "what may be the most interesting point about these visualizations of eigenline dynamics is that , unlike motion of fluid velocity fields and electric field lines , there is no `` correct '' and `` true '' motion of the eigenlines .",
    "there is neither a physical process ( e.g. , the spiraling of charged particles around magnetic field lines , the identification of specific fluid elements in velocity flows ) , nor a mathematical criterion ( e.g. , flux conservation ) available as a basis for defining or constraining the motion of lines . exploiting singularity location is the best we can do .    the intuitive feeling that there should be a well defined meaning to the motion of field lines may be rooted in the relationship of electromagnetic field line motion and energy flow , a relationship , expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vandpoynting ] ) , limited to regions , such as the radiation region , in which the * e * and * b * fields are orthogonal .",
    "this suggests the question of whether energy flow could be used as a guide to the motion of eigenlines , and hence the question whether there is a gravitational analog of the poynting flux .",
    "there is , in fact , a pragmatic quantitative measure of energy flow in gravitational waves , the landau - lifschitz pseudotensor@xcite , but this measure is neither definitive nor useful for our purposes .",
    "the fact that it is not definitive is important . just as gravitational acceleration near the earth surface vanishes in a freely falling elevator , many other aspects of gravitation vanish in an appropriately chosen reference frame . a consequence of this is the fundamental impossibility of localizing energy in a gravitational wave .",
    "the landau - lifschitz pseudotensor can give only a sort of average energy flux over several wavelengths .",
    "this already suggests that such a measure is not useful for us ; it can not help us give meaning to line motion .",
    "the mathematical details confirm that suggestion ; the pseudotensor can not be inferred from the gravitoelectric and gravitomagntic fields . in a very rough sense",

    "visualizations of gravitational fields used the recently introduced tendex / vortex eigenline formalism@xcite .",
    "we have found , as foretold in the introduction , that this comparison shows both instructive similarities and instructive differences .",
    "an important similarity of radiation examples was the change , in both cases , from a quasistatic field structure at distances from the point source small compared to a wavelength , to a transverse , @xmath0 , radiation field at distances large compared to a wavelength .",
    "the visualizations , in both cases , show the field structures that are not easily seen in the mathematics , and show how the fields make the transition from the near - source structure to the very different radiation structure .",
    "an important difference between the two cases lay in the visualization of dynamical fields .",
    "the motion of electromagnetic field lines has both mathematical and physical meaning , while the motion of gravitational eigenlines , has neither .",
    "this difference can be partially ascribed to the difference between the nature of eigenlines for a tensor field and `` lines of force '' for a vector field .",

    "[ sub : visdynagrav ] there was a rediscovery and illustration of an interesting mathematical relationship between the electromagnetic and gravitational fields . aside from trivial replacements , the complete details of electromagnetic solution  including the radiation fields  is contained within the gravitational field solution .",
