    "again , as in the two - point case , we need to construct analytic continuation of this representation , in terms of the variables containing @xmath229 and @xmath230 . to do this inside the mellin  barnes representation , we use the contour - integral version of the corresponding formula for @xmath188 , namely , eq .

    "these two contributions are related to the singular limits @xmath220 and @xmath240 in a way similar to the two - point case .    picking up this leading hqet contribution , we arrive at a double mellin  barnes representation ( in terms of the remaining contour integrals over @xmath241 and @xmath242 ) , where the kinematical variables involved yield ( in the limit @xmath11 ) the hqet variables , @xmath243 after introducing the new contour variables @xmath244 and @xmath245 we see that the resulting mellin ",
    "barnes representation is equivalent to ( [ mbintv ] ) , so that @xmath246    therefore , the hqet integrals can be formally obtained _ directly _ from the standard loop integrals , by picking up the formal taylor series in @xmath216 which has no prefactors containing @xmath4 to the power depending on @xmath10 .",
    "such prescription is similar to some other prescriptions in dimensional regularization .",
    "for instance , considering the massless limit of the integral  ( [ def_j ] ) we need to represent the result in terms of the functions of the variable @xmath247 , and then discard the contribution containing @xmath248 ( see eq .  ( 11 ) of  @xcite ) .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the hqet contributions are equivalent to the `` ultrasoft '' ones , in the language of the threshold expansion  @xcite . in other words , in the cases considered the exact result is given by the sum of two contributions . the first one is given by a formal taylor expansion of the integrand in the small parameter of the threshold expansion ( the `` hard '' contribution ) .",
    "the second one is nothing but the hqet series in @xmath216 .",
    "if we substitute the `` hard '' parts of all scalar integrals into the qcd vertex , then , in the limit @xmath249 , @xmath250 , we just get the on - shell vertex at @xmath100 . corrections to this limit are regular expansion terms in @xmath202 , @xmath251 .",
    "since we do not consider @xmath216 suppressed terms here , these corrections can be omitted .",
    "if we substitute the hqet parts of all scalar integrals ( see appendix  [ appthreshold ] ) , we should obtain the hqet vertex , which was calculated in sect .",
    "[ secvert ] . in order to make a strong check of both the results of  @xcite ( where the one - loop quark - gluon vertex was calculated in arbitrary gauge and dimension ) and of the present ones , we consider here the hqet limit of the qcd vertex  @xcite .    using the standard decomposition of the quark - gluon vertex  @xcite",
    "( see also in  @xcite ) , it can be split into longitudinal and transverse parts , @xmath252 where @xmath253 and @xmath254 are scalar functions depending on kinematical variables , whereas @xmath255 and @xmath256 are vectors which also involve dirac matrices ( see sect .",
    "iid of  @xcite for further details ) .",
    "we substitute @xmath257 at the leading order in @xmath216 , the initial and final quark spinors obey @xmath258 .",
    "therefore , we can sandwich @xmath125 between the projectors @xmath259 , and use @xmath260 with the required accuracy , there are three independent structures : @xmath261.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the others are @xmath262 according to appendix  [ appthreshold ] , the hqet - relevant `` ultrasoft '' parts of the scalar integrals are @xmath263 where the notations @xmath264 , @xmath265 and @xmath266 are defined in sect .",
    "iia of  @xcite .",
    "therefore , at the leading order ( @xmath7 ) the hqet limit of the qcd vertex ( [ bc ] ) yields @xmath267 using the results for @xmath253 and @xmath254 listed in  @xcite , we have obtained that at the order @xmath7 the coefficient of the chromomagnetic structure @xmath268 vanishes , whereas those of @xmath269 and @xmath270 reproduce the results ( [ vert1a ] ) , ( [ gq ] ) and ( [ gv ] ) , for arbitrary @xmath10 and @xmath121 .",
    "thus the qcd vertex at small @xmath15 , @xmath21 is equal to its on - shell value at @xmath240 plus the hqet vertex , up to @xmath216 corrections",
    ". we can reformulate this statement : the qcd vertex in the on - shell renormalization scheme is equal to the hqet vertex in the on - shell renormalization scheme , up to @xmath216 corrections . in qcd ,",
    "the on - shell renormalization subtracts from the one - loop correction its value at @xmath240 . in hqet ,",
    "the on - shell renormalized vertex equals the bare one , because its value at @xmath240 vanishes .",
    "the background field formalism  @xcite is convenient for considering heavy quark scattering in an external gluon field . in this method ,",
