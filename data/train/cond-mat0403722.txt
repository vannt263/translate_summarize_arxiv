    "<S> we studied the problem of many - polyelectrolyte adsorption on a repulsive charged surface by scaling analysis . according to ratio of the dielectric constant between the medium and the substrate , </S>",

    "<S> their phase diagrams are qualitatively different . </S>",
    "<S> the polyelectrolytes of low ( high ) @xmath0 are adsorbed for low ( high ) dielectric ratio , where @xmath1 is the fraction of charged monomers and @xmath2 is the polyelectrolyte valency .    </S>",
    "<S> polyelectroyte adsorption on an attractive surface has been well studied both theoretically and experimentally for a long time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently the marcoion adsorption and the associated charge inversion acquires lots of attention @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical interests to the polyelectrolyte adsorption on an attractive surface is mainly due to its importance for understanding the multilayer formation by alternate deposition of positively and negatively charged polyelectrolytes on charged surface @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> basically the theoretical works dealing with many - chain polyelectrolyte adsorption on an attractive charged surface consists of two different approaches . </S>",
    "<S> one is the self - consistent field method , that is , to solve both edwards equation and poisson - boltzmann equation simultaneously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the edwards equation describes the polyelectrolyte conformation fluctuation at the ground - state dominance limit @xcite and the poisson - boltzmann takes care of the local electrostatic potential at mean - field level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the other is scaling analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was predicted that the polyelectrolyte adsorbed on an attractive surface undergoes a transition from a compressed state to a undeformed state before the de - sorption @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling behavior of the adsorption layer thickness with respect to the surface charge density is different from that obtained by the self - consistent field method in which the overall conformational changes is ignored .    </S>",
    "<S> recently the possibility of a single chain adsorbed onto a high - dielectric substrate with repulsive surface charge was raised @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that the polyelectrolyte under the coloumb image attraction can overcome the slightly repulsive surface and is able to be adsorbed on the substrate . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to investigate many - chain adsorption by scaling analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a polyelectrolyte chain with degree of polymerization @xmath3 , fraction of charged monomers @xmath1 , and bond length @xmath4 in a solvent of dielectric constant @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> below the solvent , there is a substrate of high dielectric constant @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the surface charge density on the substrate is @xmath7 . at low ionic strength </S>",
    "<S> in which the bulk debye screening length is much larger than the adsorption layer thickness , a single polyelectrolyte is still adsorbed when the charged substrate is slightly repulsive ; that is , when the surface charge density @xmath7 does not exceed some threshold value @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the polyelectrolyte is going to de - sorb when the binding energy due to image charge attraction meets the potential barrier formed by repulsive surface @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> when polyelectrolytes of multivalency @xmath9 are adsorbed onto the repulsive surface , they forms a 2d wigner liquid on the surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> poisson - boltzmann theory fails because of strong correlation between polyelectrolytes . </S>",
    "<S> dobrynin _ </S>",
    "<S> et.al . </S>",
    "<S> _ developed the scaling theory to polyelectrolyte adsorption on an attractive surface @xcite . in the following , we extend the scaling approach to the problem of a repulsive charged surface to take care of the strong correlation between the adsorbed polyelectrolytes . </S>",
    "<S> the monovalent counterions are then treated within the poisson - boltzmann theory since it is generally believed that mean - field theory is still valid for monovalent ions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose the surface debye screening length , @xmath10 , is larger than the average distance between polyelectrolytes , @xmath11 ; otherwise , any two chains can not feel each other and the problem is reduced to a single - chain adsorption @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the effective debye screening length @xmath10 is not necessary equal to the bulk one @xmath12 because of non - uniform counterion distribution at different height from the charged surface .    in the presence of high dielectric substrate </S>",
    "<S> , the polyelectrolyte would feel a binding energy due to image charge attraction . </S>",
    "<S> its layer thickness @xmath13 can be determined by the balance between electrostatic attractive energy and conformational entropy , @xmath14 where @xmath15 measures the coupling strength between the polyelectrolyte and its image . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([balance ] ) gives @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the bjerrum length . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller fraction of charged monomers @xmath1 , the larger conformational entropy and adsorbed layer thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy is thus @xmath18    because of the repulsive charged surface , we have repulsive energy from the surface @xmath19    repulsive energy from other polyelectrolytes @xmath20    the average distance between polyelectrolytes is determined by minimization of the total energy @xmath21 with respect to @xmath11 , which gives @xmath22    in order to have a solution from eq.([minimize ] ) for @xmath23 , one should have @xmath24 which determines the critical surface charge density @xmath25 @xmath26 decreases with increasing @xmath10 . </S>",

    "<S> . expand eq.([minimize ] ) in @xmath32 , we get the surface polyelectrolyte density @xmath33 as @xmath34 , the polyelectrolytes are going to de - sorb , its surface density decreases to zero . during the de - sorption , the average distance between polyelectrolytes can be arbitrary large so that the de - sorption happens as a single - chain de - sorption process . by comparing two length scales </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 and @xmath10 , the problem is classified into two regimes . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath35 , it corresponds to many - chain adsorption , @xmath36 otherwise , when @xmath37 , it becomes single chain adsorption , @xmath38 when @xmath7 increases , inter - chain distance @xmath11 becomes larger , and then the system switches from many - chain to single - chain adsorption . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 is nothing but a surface charge density indicating the crossover . </S>",

    "<S> the adsorption transition is still first - order .    </S>",
    "<S> after the strongly correlated polyelectrolytes settled down on the surface , the effective surface charge felt by monovalent counterions varies . </S>",

    "<S> however , the naive picture does not necessarily hold since the counterions may condense on the surface , and the surface debye screening length may be greatly reduced . applying the poisson - boltzmann theory ( see details in appendix ) , the problem is again divided into two cases according to the magnitude of the new gouy - chapman ( gc ) length .     </S>",

    "<S> polyelectrolytes of lower valency ( @xmath62 ) form a correlated many - chain state . as their valency is high enough , the state turns out to be single - chain because of stronger repulsion between neighboring chains .    </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative differences between the phase diagram of @xmath40 ( or @xmath27 ) and @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) is the following . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the many - chain state with @xmath63 , it is expected the system transits to the single - chain state when the surface charge density increases . for @xmath40 </S>",

    "<S> another difference is their de - sorbed states . for @xmath40 , </S>",
    "<S> no adsorbed state exists for strongly charged polyelectrolytes ( @xmath64 ) ; while weakly charged polyelectrolytes are all de - sorbed for @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that our treatment of multi - valent polyelectrolytes interaction within the gouy - chapman layer is preliminary , in which it is still subtle @xcite . </S>",
