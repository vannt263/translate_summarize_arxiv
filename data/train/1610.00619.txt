    "the fe - based superconductor lifeas , with @xmath0 of @xmath1 , has lent itself particularly well to spectroscopic characterization by angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) due to the non - polar surface and the high quality of the samples .",

    "the gap structure of lifeas has been studied both by arpes@xcite as well as quasi - particle interference@xcite , which show a fourfold anisotropy of the gap and a characteristic distribution of gap magnitudes on different fermi surface sheets - yet neither of these yields information on the sign of the gap .",

    "finally , we note that correlations will give rise to a renormalization factor @xmath49 which essentially changes the overall energy scale in the calculation .",

    "all plots are with the same field of view covering an area of @xmath72 with the atomic positions of the surface atoms as marked in ( e ) .",
    "lines along the crystallographic axis in the calculated maps are artifacts from using a wannier function that has a finite extension in the plane .",

    "[ fig_hom ] , changing the height of the stm tip may change the positions of the conductance maxima , as already suggested by figs .",
    "[ fig_wannier ] and [ fig_cartoon ] , and this change may be bias dependent . at large height , i.e. small tunneling current , the maxima are above the positions of the li atoms for all setpoint voltages shown .",
    "the reason is the constructive interference of the fe wannier functions from nearby fe atoms , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig_cartoon ] .",
    "on the other hand , the small height cldos maps show maxima at positions of as atoms on the surface when the setpoint voltage is outside the superconducting gap , and maxima close to the li positions are observed for energies below the large gap .",
    "this switching can be understood in terms of the dominant orbital weight at these energies in conjunction with the form of the wannier functions . at large energies ( @xmath73 ) , the orbital weight is @xmath74 and @xmath46 , see fig .",

    ", one sees that the @xmath14 wannier function is actually maximal close to the nnn li positions ( see fig .",

    "the @xmath46 orbital dominates the dos , but it is also larger at the nnn li positions than at the nnn as positions .",
    "the same happens at lower tip height in the low energy regime .",

    "the maxima are again found above the as positions , see fig .",

    "[ fig_hom ] for the relative lattice position of the surface atoms in the field of view . ]    whether the switching of the lattice can be observed experimentally via stm , may well depend on the properties of the stm tip which we assumed until now to be a small tip without structure@xcite .",
    "a more realistic description of the tunneling process would involve convolving the surface wavefunctions with the wavefunction of the tip . while we do not discuss the effects of tip orbital structure here ,",
    "it is clear that even assuming a spherical symmetric tip wavefunction some smearing of the cldos will occur when calculating the actual conductance maps .",

    "lattice registration switchings with bias of this sort discussed here have been seen occasionally in experiment , but are rarely reported .",
    "one exception is ref .",

    "experimentally , the switching is not as clean since the topographs show some deviations from a non - spherical tip , but by help of the fixed position of the same impurity , it can be seen that the maxima clearly move horizontally as a function of bias voltage in qualitative agreement to the simulations .",

    "[ fig_exp_lattice ] experimental topographs obtained with two different tips near a mn defect which serves only as a point of reference .",
    "while both tips image the surface and the defect with high spatial resolution , despite the rather similar tunneling parameters , they image the surface atomic structure once with maxima on the li atoms and once on the as lattice . from the theoretical analysis , this suggests that the tip orbital probes different electronic states of the surface , as is also evident from the scattering patterns detected in the images .",

    "as mentioned earlier , the impurity potentials obtained from a first principles calculation are too strong in magnitude to yield the weak in - gap bound states at the lower gap edge observed experimentally . since the identities of the impurities in these studies are well known , and they are well isolated , a one - impurity problem for the given chemical substituent is appropriate .",
    "it seems likely therefore that the _ ab initio _",
    "method simply overestimates the impurity potentials@xcite _ relative to _ the actual electronic structure . assuming a screening that is present for all tm impurities in a similar way",
    ", the impurity potentials were multiplied with the same overall renormalization , ultimately giving a reasonable agreement of the spectra .",
    "thus the relative strengths seem to be calculated correctly , together with the signs of the various potentials .",
    "remaining discrepancies may also be due to an inadequate treatment of electronic correlations in the lifeas system .",
    "while ideal from the point of view of experimental conditions for stm , lifeas near - fermi level electronic structure shows significant deviations from dft , and current methods such as lda+dmft are unable to properly account for it @xcite .",
    "the consequences of this discrepancy for the superconducting gap in spin fluctuation theory were discussed at some length in ref . .",
    "for the moment , the current approach is the best we have , but a truly quantitative theory awaits a proper calculation of the electronic structure in this system .    finally , we note that even with the renormalizations to account for the proper electronic structure introduced above there are quantitative discrepancies in the magnitudes of the observed oscillations of the tip near impurities .",
    "we believe that accounting for local structural relaxations around the impurities and the use of an inhomogeneous wannier basis can improve the description quantitatively . to some extent",
    "similar issues arise in our treatment of the homogeneous system , indicating that a more accurate treatment of the far field of the wannier functions is also necessary .",
    "we have presented a combined theoretical and experimental analysis of the superconducting state of lifeas and the modification of the ldos due to defects .",
    "the theory is able to explain many , if not all of the features found in experiments .",
    "the theory is based on a spin - fluctuation pairing prediction for the superconducting state using first principles calculations for the electronic structure as input .",
    "the resulting pairing gap has @xmath44 character , with the small gap located on the @xmath46 band and the large gap on the @xmath105 bands , in good agreement with experiments .",
    "impurity potentials were also calculated within first principles approach .",
    "the continuum local density of states for a single defect embedded at the lifeas surface was calculated using recently developed wannier - function based methods .",
    "a surprising result of the theoretical study was that conductance maps and topographs of the homogeneous system were found to be sensitive to tip height and setpoint bias , such that under different circumstances either the as or li lattice could correspond to intensity maxima in the image .",
    "this preliminary study suggests caution in assigning site identification without a complete study varying experimental conditions",
    ". experimentally , impurity states are suitable to identify the correct positions of the fe lattice and thus allows for the observation of a movement of the registered maxima in topographs depending on current and bias voltage .",
    "this effect is also predicted in our present framework and allows a more close comparison between theory and experiment to investigate more complicated impurity configurations or possibly unravel exotic electronic orders .",
    "comparison of topographic images as well as spectra of defects show that _ ab initio _",
    "impurity potentials have to be renormalized by a factor of 2.5 to yield agreement with experiments .",
    "understanding the existence of the dimer peaks at positive bias requires the use of the wannier - based analysis and is not consistent with conventional calculations of the fe lattice ldos .",
    "the calculations may only properly account for these when introducing relaxation effects around the impurity .",
    "the good qualitative agreement of theory and experiment reported here bodes well for a future true quantitative analysis of inhomogeneous superconductivity and sts spectra in these systems .",
    "we discussed improvements in theoretical methods that are needed to reach this goal , as well as further experimental tests that may be important .",
