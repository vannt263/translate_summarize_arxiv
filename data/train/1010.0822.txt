    "the brownian distance covariance and correlation proposed by szkely and rizzo ( @xcite ) ( abbreviated sr hereafter ) is a very useful and elegant alternative to the standard measures of correlation and is based on several deep and nontrivial theoretical calculations developed earlier in szkely , rizzo and bakirov ( @xcite ) ( abbreviated srb hereafter ) .",
    "we congratulate the group on this very original and elegant work .",
    "the main result is that a single , simple statistic @xmath0 can be used to assess whether two random vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 , of possibly different respective dimensions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are dependent based on an i.i.d . sample .",
    "the proposed statistic @xmath0 estimates an interesting population parameter @xmath5 that the authors demonstrate can also be expressed as the covariance between independent brownian motions @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 dimensional indices , evaluated at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "specifically , let @xmath8 be a real valued , tight , mean - zero gaussian process with covariance @xmath9 , for @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the standard euclidean norm in @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath7 be similarly defined but for indices @xmath13 and norm @xmath14 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath16 is an independent copy of @xmath17 , and where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are independent of both @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "this justifies the designation `` brownian distance covariance . ''    by replacing brownian motion with other stochastic processes , a very wide array of alternative forms of correlation between vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be generated . in the special case where @xmath18 and the stochastic processes @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the nonrandom identify functions centered respectively at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21=\\operatorname{cov}^2(x , y)$ ] , which is the standard pearson product - moment covariance squared .",
    "thus , the results obtained by sr not only have a profound connection to brownian motion , but also include traditional measures of dependence as special cases , while , at the same time , having the potential to generate many useful new measures of dependence through the use of other stochastic processes besides brownian motion .",
    "this raises the very real possibility that a broadly applicable and unified theoretical and methodological framework for testing dependence could be developed .",
    "the sr paper is therefore not only important for the specific results contained therein but also for the possibly far reaching consequences for future statistical research in both theory and applications . for the remainder of the paper , we describe two possible extensions of these results .",
    "the first extension is for high dimensional data that can be coerced into a hilbert space , including certain high throughput screening and functional data settings .",
    "the second extension involves very simple modifications that may yield increased power in some settings .",
    "we first present some initial results and consequences of sr and srb that will prove useful in later developments .",
    "we then present the hilbert space extension with a few example applications . some modifications leading to potential variations in power",
    "will then be described .",
    "the paper will then conclude with a brief discussion .",
    "we now present a few initial results which will be useful in later sections . for a paired sample of size @xmath22 , @xmath23 , of realizations of @xmath17 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are random variables from arbitrary normed spaces with respective norms @xmath24 and @xmath25 , define , analogously to sr , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . also define @xmath28,\\\\ t_{20}&=&e[\\|x_1-x_2\\|_x]\\times e[\\|y_1-y_2\\|_y ] , \\\\ t_{30}&=&e[\\|x_1-x_2\\|_x\\|y_1-y_3\\|_{y}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath29 . also let @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; and let @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this allows us to define also @xmath34 and @xmath35 , provided the denominators are nonzero ( and defined to be zero otherwise ) .",
    "the main distinction between this and the definitions in sr is the use of arbitrary normed spaces .",
    "because this has a standard @xmath36-statistic structure , we have the following general result , the proof of which follows from standard theory for @xmath36-statistics [ see , e.g. , chapter 12 of van der vaart ( @xcite ) ] :    [ lemma1 ] provided @xmath37 and @xmath38 , then @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "[ remark1 ] in the special case where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are from finite - dimensional euclidean spaces , we know from theorems  14 of sr that @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are all nonnegative ; that @xmath48 and @xmath49 ; that @xmath50 or @xmath51 only when @xmath1 or @xmath2 is trivial ; that @xmath52 or @xmath53 only when the @xmath1 s or @xmath2 s in the sample are all identical ; that @xmath54 ; and that @xmath55 only when @xmath1 and @xmath2 are independent .",
    "we now wish to generalize the above results in the finite - dimensional context to a class of norms more broad than euclidean norms .",
    "these results will be useful for later sections .",
    "let @xmath56 and @xmath57 be respectively @xmath58 and @xmath59 symmetric , positive definite matrices . let a `` tilde '' placed over @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , etc .",
    ", denote the quantity obtained by replacing @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 in @xmath63 , @xmath64 , etc .",
    "for example , @xmath69 .",
    "we now have the following very simple extension :    [ lemma2 ] let @xmath56 and @xmath57 be symmetric and positive definite .",
    "then @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are all nonnegative ; and all of the other results in remark  [ remark1 ] remain true with a `` tilde '' placed over the given quantities . moreover , @xmath76 if and only if @xmath55 .",
    "for a symmetric , positive definite matrix @xmath77 , let @xmath78 denote the symmetric square root of @xmath77 , that is , @xmath79 .",
    "note that such a square root always exists and , moreover , is always positive definite .",
    "now define @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and note that @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "now replace  @xmath1 and  @xmath2 in the quantities listed in remark  [ remark1 ] with @xmath36 and @xmath84 . by the symmetry properties of these norms , the first part of the lemma up to just before the last sentence is proved .",
    "the last sentence follows from the simple observation that @xmath36 and @xmath84 are independent if and only if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are independent by the positive definiteness of @xmath85 and @xmath86 . since @xmath55",
    "if and only if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are independent , we now conclude that @xmath76 if and only if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are independent .",
    "the entire lemma now follows .",
    "the third initial result involves some nontrivial properties of independent components in the finite dimensional setting .",
    "suppose for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 ; and suppose also that the two vectors @xmath96^t,[x^{(3)}]^t)^t$ ] and @xmath97^t,[y^{(3)}]^t)^t$ ] are mutually independent and also independent of @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we have the following somewhat surprising result :    [ lemma3 ] @xmath100 .    for any @xmath101 and @xmath102 , with @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 ,",
    "the independence assumptions and standard characteristic function properties yield @xmath109)-e\\exp(it^tx)e\\exp(is^ty)|\\\\ & & \\qquad=\\bigl|f_{\\tilde{x}}(t)f_{\\tilde{y}}(s ) \\bigl\\{e\\exp\\bigl(i\\bigl[t_1^tx^{(1)}+s_1^ty^{(1)}\\bigr]\\bigr)\\\\ & & \\qquad\\quad\\hspace*{57pt } { } -e\\exp\\bigl(it_1^tx^{(1)}\\bigr)e\\exp \\bigl(is_1^ty^{(1)}\\bigr)\\bigr\\}\\bigr|\\\\ & & \\qquad=\\bigl|e\\exp\\bigl(i\\bigl[t_1^tx^{(1)}+s_1^ty^{(1)}\\bigr]\\bigr)-e\\exp\\bigl(it_1^tx^{(1)}\\bigr)e\\exp \\bigl(is_1^ty^{(1)}\\bigr)\\bigr|\\\\ & & \\qquad=    combining this with theorems  1 and  2 of sr , we obtain that @xmath110 and  @xmath111 and , thus , we can replace @xmath112 and  @xmath111 with degenerate random variables fixed at zero . doing the same on the left - hand side yields the desired result .",
    "the basic idea we propose is to extend the results to hilbert spaces which can be approximated by sequences of finite - dimensional euclidean spaces",
    ". we will give a few examples shortly .",
    "first , we give the conditions for our results .",
    "assume @xmath1 is a random variable in a hilbert space  @xmath113 with inner produce @xmath114 and norm @xmath115 .",
    "a superscript @xmath116 will be used to denote adjoint .",
    "say that @xmath1 is `` finitely approximable '' if there exists a sequence @xmath117 such that for each @xmath118 , there exists a linear map @xmath119 for which @xmath120 is symmetric and positive definite on @xmath121 , @xmath122 is nondecreasing , @xmath123 for some sequence of euclidean random variables @xmath124 , and that @xmath125 as @xmath126 .",
    "note that we can assume that @xmath120 is the identity without loss of generality .",
    "this follows since we can always replace @xmath124 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 with @xmath129 , where @xmath130 , to yield @xmath131 with @xmath132 being the identity .",
    "[ ex1 ] let @xmath1 be functional data with realizations that are functions in the hilbert space @xmath133 $ ] consisting of functions @xmath134\\mapsto{\\mathbb{r}}$ ] satisfying @xmath135 .",
    "specifically , we will assume that @xmath136 where @xmath137 are independent random variables with mean zero and variance  1 , @xmath138 form an orthonormal basis in @xmath139 $ ] , and @xmath140 are fixed constants satisfying @xmath141 .",
    "this formulation can yield a large variety of tight stochastic processes and can be a realistic model for some kinds of functional data .",
    "let @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and , for any vector @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",
    "clearly , @xmath123 is in @xmath113 almost surely , since @xmath146 is bounded almost surely .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath147 $ ] , it can be shown that @xmath148 and , thus , @xmath120 is the identity by the orthonormality of the basis and is therefore positive definite . since @xmath149 , @xmath150 as @xmath126 .",
    "thus , @xmath1 is finitely approximable .",
    "[ ex2 ] this is basically the same as example  [ ex1 ] , except that we will not require the basis functions to be orthogonal .",
    "specifically , let @xmath151 be as given in  ( [ eq1 ] ) , with the basis functions satisfying @xmath152 , for all @xmath153 , but not necessary being mutually orthogonal .",
    "let @xmath154 , for @xmath155 , and define @xmath156 to be the @xmath157 matrix with entry @xmath158 for row @xmath159 and column @xmath160 for @xmath161 .",
    "assume that @xmath162 is positive definite for each @xmath118 and also assume that @xmath163 .",
    "if we now follow parallel calculations to those done in example 1 , we can readily deduce that with @xmath164 , we have @xmath128 and @xmath165 defined as before , but with @xmath166 instead of the identity , while @xmath167 also as before . the increased flexibility enlarges the scope of stochastic processes achievable to include , for example , brownian motion .",
    "let @xmath168 be an infinitely long euclidean vector in @xmath169 , that is , @xmath170",

    "it is fairly easy to see that if we let @xmath172 be a vector with the first @xmath173 elements being identical to the first @xmath173 elements of @xmath1 but with all remaining elements equal to zero , then @xmath167 , as @xmath126 , and all of the remaining conditions for finite approximability are satisfied .",
    "this example may be applicable to certain high throughput screening settings where the vector of measurements may be arbitrarily high - dimensional .",
    "the following lemma tells us that the range - related properties of brownian distance covariance are preserved for finitely approximable random variables :    [ lemma4 ] assume that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are both finitely approximable random variables in hilbert spaces .",
    "then @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are all nonnegative , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath172 and @xmath176 be sequences such that @xmath177 and @xmath178 as @xmath179 . using simple algebra , we can verify that @xmath180 which implies @xmath181 .",
    "similar arguments verify the desired results for @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath182 .",
    "now , for a sample of size  @xmath22 , @xmath23 , we can create a sequence of samples @xmath183 , such that @xmath184 by finite approximability .",
    "let @xmath185 be the same as @xmath42 but with the @xmath173th approximating sample replacing the sample observations .",
    "since convergence in mean implies convergence in probability , we can apply basic algebra to verify that @xmath186 as @xmath126 .",
    "similar arguments verify the desired results for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath187 , and this completes the proof .",
    "our ultimate goal in this section , however , is to show that @xmath182 has the same implications for assessing dependence for finitely approximable hilbert spaces as it does for finite dimensional settings .",
    "this is actually quite challenging , and we are only able to achieve part of the goal in this paper .",
    "the following is our first result in this direction :    [ lemma5 ] suppose @xmath1 and @xmath2 are random variables in finitely approximable hilbert spaces .",
    "then @xmath188 implies that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are dependent .",
    "assume that @xmath188 but that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are independent . by finite approximability , there exists a sequence of paired random variables @xmath189 such that @xmath172 and @xmath176 are independent for each @xmath190 , @xmath167 , and @xmath191 .",
    "this implies that @xmath192 for all @xmath190 .",
    "since also @xmath193 , we have a contradiction .",
    "hence , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are dependent .",
    "if we could also show that @xmath194 implies independence , we would have essentially full homology with the finite dimensional case .",
    "it is unclear how to show this in general , and it may not even be true in general . however , it is certainly true for an interesting special case which we now present .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be random variables in finitely approximable hilbert spaces .",
    "suppose there exists linear maps @xmath195 and @xmath196 with adjoints for which both @xmath197 and @xmath198 are identities , and that @xmath199 and @xmath200 , where @xmath201 and @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 are finite - dimensional subspaces of @xmath113 and @xmath205 , respectively , and that @xmath206 and @xmath207 are mutually independent and independent of @xmath208 .",
    "we will call a random pair @xmath17 that satisfies these conditions `` at most finitely dependent . '' for example , paired functional data @xmath17 could be at most finitely dependent if all possible dependencies between the two populations @xmath1 and @xmath2 are attributable to at most a few principle functions ( or principle components ) in each population and that the remaining components are independent noise .",

    "the answer should be yes since it appears that @xmath56 and @xmath57 could potentially be selected to emphasize dependence for certain subcomponents of @xmath1 and @xmath2 while de - emphasizing dependence for other subcomponents .",
    "the answer to this question , unfortunately , seems to be very hard to pin down rigorously .",

    "we have briefly proposed two generalizations of the brownian distance covariance , one based on alternative norms to euclidean norms , and the other based on infinite dimensional data .",
    "the first generalization raises the possibility of fine - tuning the statistics proposed in sr to increase power , and the second generalization opens the door for applicability of the results in sr to a broader array of data types , including infinite dimensional data and data with dimension increasing with sample size .",
    "however , for both of these generalizations , there remain many open questions that could lead to important further improvements . in either case , the results of sr are very important both practically and theoretically and should result in many important future developments in both the application and theory of statistics ."
