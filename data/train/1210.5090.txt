    "random walk metropolis ( rwm ) algorithms are widely used generic markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithms .",
    "the ease with which rwm algorithms can be constructed has no doubt played a pivotal role in their popularity .",
    "the efficiency of a rwm algorithm depends fundamentally upon the scaling of the proposal density .",
    "choose the variance of the proposal to be too small and the rwm will converge slowly since all its increments are small . conversely , choose the variance of the proposal to be too large and too high a proportion of proposed moves will be rejected . of particular interest is how the scaling of the proposal variance depends upon the dimensionality of the target distribution .",
    "the target distribution is the distribution of interest and the mcmc algorithm is constructed such that the stationary distribution of the markov chain is the target distribution .",
    "the introduction is structured as follows .",
    "we outline known results for continuous independent and identically distributed product densities from @xcite and subsequent work .",
    "we highlight the scope and limitations of the results before introducing the discontinuous target densities to be studied in this paper . while the statements of the key results ( theorem  [ main ] ) in this paper are similar to those given for continuous target densities , the proofs are markedly different .",
    "a discussion of why a new method of proof is required for discontinuous target densities is given .",
    "finally , we give an outline of the remainder of the paper .",
    "the results of this paper have quite general consequences for the implementation of metropolis algorithms on discontinuous densities ( as are commonly applied in many bayesian statistics problems ) , namely :    full- ( high- ) dimensional update rules can be an order of magnitude slower than strategies involving smaller dimensional updates .",
    "( see theorem  [ thmprop ] below . )    for target densities with bounded support , metropolis algorithms can be an order of magnitude slower than algorithms which first transform the target support to @xmath5 for some @xmath0 .    in  @xcite ,",
    "a sequence of target densities of the form @xmath6 were considered as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is twice differentiable and satisfies certain mild moment conditions ; see  @xcite , ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) .",
    "the following random walk metropolis algorithm was used to obtain a sample @xmath9 from @xmath10 .",
    "draw @xmath11 from @xmath12 . for @xmath13 and @xmath14 let @xmath15 be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) according to @xmath16 and @xmath17 . at time @xmath18 , propose @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the proposal standard deviation to be discussed shortly .",
    "set @xmath21 with probability @xmath22 otherwise set @xmath23 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath24 has stationary distribution @xmath12 , and hence , for all @xmath13 , @xmath25 .",
    "the key question addressed in @xcite was : starting from the stationary distribution , how should @xmath20 be chosen to optimize the rate at which the rwm algorithm explores the stationary distribution ?",
    "since the components of @xmath26 are i.i.d . , it suffices to study the marginal behavior of the first component , @xmath27 . in  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that if @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30,1}^d$ ] @xmath31 , then @xmath32 where @xmath33 satisfies the langevin sde @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the standard normal c.d.f . and @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "note that the `` speed measure '' of the diffusion @xmath39 only depends upon @xmath40 through @xmath41 .",
    "the diffusion limit for @xmath42 is unsurprising in that for a time interval of length @xmath43 , @xmath44 moves are made each of size @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the movements in the first component ( appropriately normalized ) converge to those of a langevin diffusion with the `` most efficient '' asymptotic diffusion having the largest speed measure  @xmath46 .",
    "since the diffusion limit involves speeding up time by a factor of  @xmath0 , we say that the mixing of the algorithm is @xmath44 .",
    "the optimal value of  @xmath47 is @xmath48 , which leads to an average optimal acceptance rate ( aoar ) of 0.234 .",
    "this has major practical implications for practitioners , in that , to monitor the ( asymptotic ) efficiency of the rwm algorithm it is sufficient to study the proportion of proposed moves accepted .",
    "there are three key assumptions made in  @xcite .",
    "first , @xmath49 , that is , the algorithm starts in the stationary distribution and @xmath20 is chosen to optimize exploration of the stationary distribution .",
    "this assumption has been made in virtually all subsequent optimal scaling work ; see , for example ,  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the one exception is  @xcite , where @xmath11 is started from the mode of @xmath12 with explicit calculations given for a standard multivariate normal distribution . in  @xcite , it is shown that @xmath50 is optimal for maximizing the rate of convergence to the stationary distribution .",
    "since convergence is shown to occur within @xmath51 iterations , the time taken to explore the stationary distribution dominates the time taken to converge to the stationary distribution , and thus overall it is optimal to choose @xmath52 .",
    "it is difficult to prove generic results for @xmath53 .",
    "however , the findings of  @xcite suggest that even when @xmath54 , it is best to scale the proposal distribution based upon @xmath55 .",
    "it is worth noting that in  @xcite it was found that for the metropolis adjusted langevin algorithm ( mala ) , the optimal scaling of @xmath20 for @xmath11 started at the mode of a multivariate normal is @xmath56 compared to @xmath57 for @xmath55 .",
    "second , @xmath12 is an i.i.d .",
    "product density .",
    "this assumption has been relaxed by a number of authors with @xmath50 and an aoar of 0.234 still being the case , for example , independent , scaled product densities ( @xcite and  @xcite ) , gibbs random fields  @xcite , exchangeable normals  @xcite and elliptical densities  @xcite .",
    "thus the simple rule of thumb of tuning @xmath20 such that one in four proposed moves are accepted holds quite generally . in  @xcite and  @xcite , examples where the aoar is strictly less than 0.234",
    "are given .",
    "these correspond to different orders of magnitude being appropriate for the scaling of the proposed moves in different components .",
    "third , the results are asymptotic as @xmath7 .",
    "however , simulations have shown that for i.i.d .",
    "product densities an acceptance rate of 0.234 is close to optimal for @xmath58 ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "departures from the i.i.d .",
    "product density require larger @xmath0 for the asymptotic results to be optimal , but @xmath59 is often seen in practical mcmc problems . in  @xcite and @xcite , optimal acceptance rates are obtained for finite @xmath0 for some special cases .    with the exceptions of  @xcite and  @xcite , in the above works @xmath60",
    "is assumed to have a continuous ( and suitably differentiable ) probability density function ( p.d.f . ) .",
    "the aim of the current work is to investigate the situation where the target distribution has a discontinuous p.d.f . , and specifically , target distributions confined to the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube @xmath61^d$ ] .",
    "that is , we consider target distributions of the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is twice differentiable upon @xmath61 $ ] with @xmath65 we then use the following random walk metropolis algorithm to obtain a  sample @xmath66 from @xmath12 .",
    "draw @xmath11 from @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath13 and @xmath14 let @xmath67 be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) according to @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath69 . at time @xmath18 , propose @xmath70 set @xmath21 with probability @xmath71 otherwise set @xmath23 .    in  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "spherical and elliptical densities are considered which have very different geometry to the hypercube restricted densities . therefore different approaches are taken in these papers with results akin to those obtained for continuous target densities .",
    "densities of the form ( [ eq1b ] ) have previously been studied in  @xcite , where the expected square jumping distance ( esjd ) has been computed .",
    "the esjd is @xmath72 = d { \\mathbb{e}}_{\\pi_d } [ ( x_{1,1}^d - x_{0,1}^d)^2 ] , \\ ] ] the mean squared distance between @xmath11 and @xmath73 , where @xmath55 . in @xcite , appendix  b , it is shown that for @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 \\rightarrow\\frac{l^2}{3 } \\exp\\biggl ( - \\frac{l}{2 }",
    "\\biggr ) \\qquad\\mbox{as } { d \\rightarrow\\infty}.\\ ] ] thus asymptotically ( as @xmath7 ) the esjd is maximized by taking @xmath78 which corresponds to an aoar of @xmath79 ( @xmath800.1353 ) . in this paper , we show that @xmath74 and an aoar of @xmath79 holds more generally for target distributions of the form given by ( [ eq1a ] ) and ( [ eq1b ] ) .",
    "moreover , we prove a much stronger result than that given in  @xcite , in that , we prove that @xmath81,1}^d$ ] converges weakly to an appropriate langevin diffusion @xmath82 with speed measure @xmath83 as @xmath7 , where @xmath84 .",
    "this gives a clear indication of how the markov chain explores the stationary distribution .",
    "by contrast the esjd only gives a measure of average behavior and does not take account of the possibility of the markov chain becoming `` stuck . ''",
    "if @xmath85 $ ] is very low , the markov chain started @xmath86 is likely to spend a large number of iterations at @xmath87 before accepting a move away from @xmath87 . note that since @xmath88 involves speeding up time by a factor of @xmath89 , we say that the mixing of the algorithm is @xmath90 .",
    "the esjd is easy to compute and asymptotically , as @xmath7 , the esjd ( appropriately scaled ) converges to @xmath39 .",
    "thus in discussing possible extensions of the langevin diffusion limit proved in theorem  [ main ] for i.i.d .",
    "product densities of the form given in ( [ eq1a ] ) and ( [ eq1b ] ) , we make considerable use of the esjd . however , we highlight the limitations of the esjd in discussing extensions of theorem  [ main ] .    in most previous work on optimal",
    "scaling , the components of @xmath91 are taken to be independent and identically distributed @xmath16 random variables .",
    "the reason for choosing @xmath68 $ ] for discontinuous target densities is mathematical convenience .",
    "the results proved in this paper hold with gaussian rather than uniform proposal distributions , but some elements of the proof are less straightforward .",
    "for discussion of the esjd for densities ( [ eq1a ] ) for general @xmath92 subject to @xmath93 < \\infty$ ] , see  @xcite , appendix b.    while the key result , a langevin diffusion limit for the movement in the first component , is the same as  @xcite , the proof is markedly different .",
    "note that , for finite @xmath0 , @xmath42 and @xmath94 are not markov chains since whether or not a proposed move is accepted depends upon all the components in @xmath12 . in  @xcite , it is shown that there exists @xmath95 such that @xmath96 } \\{\\mathbf{x}_t^d \\notin f_d \\ } ) \\rightarrow0 $ ] as @xmath7 and @xmath97 - 2\\phi\\biggl ( -\\frac{l \\sqrt{i}}{2 } \\biggr ) \\biggr| \\leq\\varepsilon_d,\\ ] ] where @xmath98 as @xmath7 . while ( [ eqrevb7 ] ) is not explicitly stated in  @xcite ,",
    "it is the essence of the requirements of the sets @xmath99 , stating that for large @xmath0 , with high probability over the first @xmath100 iterations the acceptance probability of the markov chain is approximately constant , being within @xmath101 of @xmath102 .",
    "( note @xmath103 rather than @xmath0 is used for dimensionality in  @xcite . )",
    "thus in the limit as @xmath7 the effect of the other components on movements in the first component converges to a deterministic acceptance probability @xmath102 .",
    "the situation is more complex for @xmath12 of the form given by ( [ eq1a ] ) and ( [ eq1b ] ) as the acceptance rate in the limit as @xmath7 is inherently stochastic .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath12 is the uniform distribution on the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube so that @xmath104^d \\}}$ ] .",
    "letting @xmath105 and @xmath106 , this gives @xmath107 = \\prod_{i \\in r_d^l } \\biggl ( \\frac{1}{2 } + \\frac{x_i}{2 \\sigma_d } \\biggr ) \\times\\prod_{i \\in r_d^u } \\biggl ( \\frac{1}{2 } + \\frac{1-x_i}{2 \\sigma_d } \\biggr).\\ ] ] thus the acceptance probability is totally determined by the components at the boundary ( within @xmath20 of 0 or 1 ) .",
    "the total number of components in @xmath108 is @xmath109 which converges in distribution to @xmath110 as @xmath7 .",
    "thus the number of components close to the boundary is inherently stochastic .",
    "moreover , the location of the components within @xmath111 plays a crucial role in the acceptance probability ; see ( [ eqrevb8 ] ) .",
    "therefore there is no hope of replicating directly the method of proof applied in  @xcite and subsequently , in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we need a homogenization argument which involves looking at @xmath112 over @xmath113 $ ] steps ; cf .",
