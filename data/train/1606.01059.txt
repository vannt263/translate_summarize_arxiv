    "the blue vertical line in each panel denotes the measured mid - eclipse phase , red line denotes the mid - eclipse phase expected from the orbital period decay extrapolated from @xcite and the green line is the expected mid - eclipse phase from the orbital period decay extrapolated from @xcite .",
    "all the mid - eclipse times extrapolated from @xcite and all but one from @xcite appear before the measured mid - eclipse phase for all the orbital intensity profiles , implying that the orbital period decay is lower than the previously estimated values .",

    "the different error bars quoted previously are only the statistical errors .",
    "however , eclipse measurements in different energy bands with different instruments are also likely to have some systematic differences . to have a more realistic estimates of error bars and only with the aim of measuring a long term period derivative ,",
    "we have re - estimated the errors on the mid - eclipse times , which are now likely to include the systematic differences between the different instruments .",

    "a linear fit is done separately on these two segments and the average standard deviation of the data - points from the linear fit is taken as the errors on the mid - eclipse times for these two segments ( given in table 1 ) .",
    "as seen in top panel of figure [ gspc_pca ] , the orbital intensity profile of 4u 170037 constructed out of long term light curves from the x - ray all sky monitors like _ swift_bat show a smooth profile with a sharp eclipse due to averaging effects of observations made over many orbits .",
    "however at short timescales , the light curves show strong variations , including flares and dips , characteristic of many hmxbs . among the light curves of 4u 170037 , those with single observation covering eclipse like _ exosat_gspc and _ rxte_pca show strong flares and dips ( bottom panel of figure [ gspc_pca ] ) , which introduces significant uncertainities in the eclipse ingress and egress profiles and hence , in the mid - eclipse time determination . the mid - eclipse time estimated from the _ exosat _ observation in 1985",

    "as seen in the right panel of figure [ gspc_pca ] , the determination of the exact point of ingress and egress of the eclipse is complicated by the presence of flares and/or dips around the eclipse ingress and egress . to further emphasize on the contribution of flares in uncertainities on the mid - eclipse times in case of pointed observations",

    ", we infer that the statistical error of 0.003 days or 260 secs quoted in @xcite is an underestimate of the actual error on the mid - eclipse time , as there is a larger systematic error owing to flares / dips .",
    "determination of eclipse duration is also complicated by the presence of same flares and/or dips .",
    "in fact the eclipse durations determined from single observations with _ uhuru _ @xcite , _ copernicus _ @xcite and _ exosat _ @xcite are considerably larger with large error bars than those estimated from long term light curves from the all sky monitors .",
    "we have re - calculated the errors on the _ exosat _ mid - eclipse time as mentioned in section 2.1 .",
    "it appears that the faster rate of orbital period decay in the earlier estimates @xcite were result of small statistical error considered for the _ exosat _ mid - eclipse data .",
