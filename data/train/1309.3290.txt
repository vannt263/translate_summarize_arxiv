    "planetesimal agglomeration must proceed in gaseous protoplanetary disks .",
    "it has long been recognized that gas drag is an important agent of planetesimal dynamics ( marzari & scholl 2000 ; thbault et al .",

    "2008 ) , helping lower relative speeds of planetesimals to some extent .",
    "recently it has also been realized that the gravitational field of a massive protoplanetary disk can have a strong effect on planetesimal dynamics .",
    "in particular , rafikov ( 2013b , hereafter r13 ) has shown that an _",
    "axisymmetric _ , massive gaseous disk drives fast precession of planetesimal orbits by its gravity , which effectively suppresses eccentricity excitation by the companion .",
    "this mechanism permits growth of even @xmath9 km planetesimals at 2 au as long as the disk is massive ( @xmath10 ) and axisymmetric .    at the same time",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary disks in binaries always find that disks perturbed by the companion develop some degree of non - axisymmetry ( okazaki et al .",

    "2008 ) , which usually manifests itself as a non - zero disk eccentricity .",
    "such a disk has a non - axisymmetric component of its gravitational field which affects planetesimals in a way similar to the binary companion .",
    "thus , one expects an eccentric gaseous disk to drive planetesimal eccentricity _ excitation _ ( in addition to that produced by the binary companion ) , an effect absent in the case of an axisymmetric disk studied in r13 .",
    "recent work of marzari et al .",
    "( 2013 ) supports this expectation by showing this effect to operate in _ circumbinary _ disks , which can also develop eccentric structure and drive eccentricity growth by their gravity .",
    "the goal of this work is to analyze dynamics of planetesimals in the presence of gravitational perturbations due to both the binary companion and the eccentric disk . to focus on purely gravitational effects we neglect gas drag in our calculations ( it is taken into account in rafikov & silsbee 2014a , b ) .",
    "we explore planetesimal dynamics in the secular approximation , neglecting short - period perturbations of planetesimal orbits that average out over the long time intervals .",
    "the majority of our results are derived for the case of a non - precessing disk , which is steady with respect to the orientation of the eccentric orbit of the secondary .",

    "the disk is eccentric in a sense that _ trajectories of its fluid elements are confocal ellipses _ , which in general is not equivalent to @xmath18 being constant along these ellipses ( see the discussion of this approximation in  [ sect : disc ] ) .",

    "this is because near the disk edge , boundary terms neglected in computing the figure [ fig : psi_pl ] start to affect the values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 in a non - trivial manner , see figure [ fig : psi_alpha ] .",
    "we plot eccentricity profiles for different values of the disk mass . at the lowest disk mass , @xmath166 ,",
    "planetesimal eccentricity @xmath39 starts out very high in the outer disk ( in the bb regime , see figure [ fig : phase_space ] ) , above @xmath163 .",
    "a notable feature of this profile is the _ secular resonance _ located at @xmath167 au and causing @xmath39 to diverge .",

    "the origin of this resonance lies in the fact that @xmath109 is always positive , whereas for the disks that we are considering , @xmath101 is negative , see figure [ fig : psi_pl ] .",
    "this means that at @xmath121 ( see equation ( [ eq : a_a ] ) ) , where @xmath168 one actually has @xmath169 and our secular solution ( [ fig : psi_pl ] ) diverges .",
    "inward of the resonance , @xmath39 rapidly goes down ( in db and dd regimes ) and asymptotically approaches @xmath164 for @xmath170 au .    for a somewhat more massive disk @xmath171",
    "the @xmath39 profile looks very different  it does not exhibit secular resonance ( since @xmath121 is now outside the outer disk edge @xmath32 ) and generally features lower values of @xmath39 .",
    "this happens because with such a massive disk , planetesimal excitation is never in the bb regime .",
    "disk gravity governs particle dynamics essentially through the whole disk .",
    "this is even more so for the @xmath172 disk .",
    "at this high mass planetesimal eccentricity curves closely follow @xmath164 for all @xmath38 . as a result , in low-@xmath34 disks",
    "@xmath39 can be appreciably lower than what it is if planetesimals are affected by the gravity of the binary companion alone , similar to the case studied in r13 .",
    "somewhat counerintuitively , adding an additional perturber  a massive disk  to the system does not heat it up dynamically but in fact _ reduces _ planetesimal random velocities .    in all cases",
    "we see that @xmath39 is above the smaller of the @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "thus , nonzero disk eccentricity introduces a _ lower limit _ on the @xmath39 value .",
    "so far we have been dealing with the case of non - precessing disk which keeps its orientation fixed in the frame of the binary orbit .",
    "however , simulations often find that gas disks in binaries not only develop a non - zero eccentricity but also precess ( okazaki et al . 2002 ; paardekooper et al . 2008 ; marzari et al .",
    "thus it is important to discuss how planetesimal dynamics changes in the case of a precessing disk .    in appendix [",
    "sect : prec_app ] we present the extension of our solutions for the planetesimal eccentricity in  [ sect : ev_eq ] to the case of a disk that precesses as a solid body at a constant rate has a meaning different from that in r13 , where @xmath173 was equivalent to @xmath101 in our current notation . ]",
    "we find that the eccentricity vector can again be separated into three distinct contributions , see equation ( [ eq : e_precess ] ) : ( 1 ) standard forced eccentricity vector due to binary with amplitude @xmath174 , stationary in the binary frame , ( 2 ) forced eccentricity vector due to the disk with amplitude @xmath175 , rotating at the rate @xmath176 , and ( 3 ) the free eccentricity term with amplitude |*e*_free| & = & ^1/2 [ eq : free ] rotating at the precession rate @xmath74 ( here @xmath177 is the value of @xmath27 at @xmath178 ) .",
    "the expression for the characteristic eccentricity becomes more complicated and depends on the value of @xmath177 .",
    "the maximum possible eccentricity ( for planetesimals starting with @xmath179 ) is reached when @xmath180 or @xmath93 ( disk and binary periapses aligned or anti - aligned initially ) , depending on the signs of @xmath74 , @xmath102 , and @xmath181 . then the maximum eccentricity is given by @xmath182    comparing this expression with equation ( [ echar ] ) we conclude that disk precession does not affect planetesimal eccentricity behavior as long as @xmath183 .",
    "however , in the opposite case of @xmath184 the disk - driven forced part of the eccentricity vector is suppressed compared to the case of no precession .",
    "this is because rapid precession of the disk ( compared to the rate of planetesimal orbital precession ) effectively averages out the non - axisymmetric part of the disk potential , considerably reducing related eccentricity excitation .",
    "this has implications discussed in ",
    "[ sect : rapid_precess ] . at the same time",
    "the forced eccentricity contribution due to binary stays unchanged for planetesimals embedded in the precessing disk .",
    "we expect these asymptotic results to remain valid even in the case of non - uniform disk precession , both when it is much faster and much slower than @xmath185 .",
    "however , all this discussion strictly applies only in the absence of gas drag .",
    "we can put our findings in the context of existing results on the purely gravitational dynamics ( i.e. not accounting for gas drag ) of planetesimals in binaries .",
    "heppenheimer ( 1978 ) explored planetesimal dynamics under the gravity of the companion alone .",
    "our results reduce to his in the limit of a zero - mass disk , i.e. when planetesimal dynamics is in the bb regime , see  [ sect : bb ] .",
    "it was first shown analytically in r13 that the gravity of a massive disk can significantly suppress planetesimal eccentricity excitation in binaries .",
    "the reason lies in the fast precession of planetesimal orbits caused by the disk gravity , which effectively averages out @xmath39 forcing by the companion .",
    "this effect is present in our calculations as well and we reproduce the results of r13 in case db .",
    "however , our work includes another important ingredient not considered previously in the framework of secular theory  gravitational forcing of planetesimal eccentricity by the disk itself , which should be present in addition to planetesimal precession if the disk is eccentric .",
    "while some numerical studies on this topic do exist ( see  [ sect : num_compare ] ) analytical understanding of their results has been hampered by the complexity of the problem .    in this work",
    "we have provided the first ( to the best of our knowledge ) calculation of the eccentric disk potential in application to planetesimal dynamics . using this prescription we uncovered the existence of two entirely new regimes of planetesimal dynamics",
    " case bd (  [ sect : bd ] ) and case dd (  [ sect : dd ] )  in which eccentricity excitation by the disk exceeds that due to the secondary .",
    "the latter regime ( dd ) represents a very common situation in protoplanetary disks in binaries . as we have shown in ",
    "[ sect : ecc_behavior ] in many cases planetesimal excitation is in the dd regime throughout the whole disk .",
    "significance of this dynamical regime also lies in the fact that the disk drives planetesimal eccentricities to a value of order the local disk eccentricity , see equation ( [ eq : dd_ecc ] ) .",
    "even though in the absence of any damping agents eccentricity of a particle starting on a circular orbit oscillates , see equation ( [ eq : e_p ] ) , so that during some periods @xmath186 , most of the time @xmath39 is of order @xmath187 in the regime dd .",
    "thus , eccentricity of the disk gives rise to a _",
    "lower limit _ on the characteristic planetesimal eccentricity ( [ echar ] ) , which is a very important finding .    in particular , it constrains the applicability of the axisymmetric disk approximation used in r13 .",
    "indeed , let us calculate @xmath39 using equation ( [ eq : db_ecc ] ) , which is identical to the result of r13 , for a system with @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath124 au harboring an axisymmetric disk with @xmath125 au , @xmath191 , @xmath59 . at @xmath192",
    "au we find @xmath193 , which is much less that it would be in a diskless case , @xmath194 , see equation ( [ eq : bb_ecc ] ) .",
    "however , for this result to hold in a non - axisymmetric disk the disk eccentricity at 2 au has to be less than @xmath195 .",
    "whether such low @xmath28 is realistic is not clear at the moment ( see  [ sect : num_compare ] ) .",
    "our current results have been derived assuming that the disk affects planetesimals only via its gravitational field . in practice planetesimals",
    "are also subject to gas drag , which has important consequences for their dynamics .",
    "first , gas drag lowers planetesimal velocities with respect to gas , which also lowers relative planetesimal velocities therefore positively affecting survival in mutual collisions .",
    "second , it has long been known that gas drag introduces apsidal alignment of planetesimal orbits ( marzari & scholl 2000 ) , which considerably reduces relative collision velocities of near - equal bodies . however , planetesimals of different sizes would still collide at high speeds suppressing growth ( thbault et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "third , gas drag damps the free part of eccentricity , see beaug et al .",
    "this should affect the time dependence of planetesimal eccentricity , which in our case is given by equation ( [ eq : e_p ] ) .",
    "we address the effects of gas drag on planetesimal dynamics in binaries in rafikov & silsbee ( 2014a ) .    because of the neglect of gas drag our current results are strictly valid only for relatively large objects , with sizes of several hundred km .",
    "for such planetesimals gas drag can be unimportant compared to purely gravitational forces during rather long time span , and may thus be neglected .",
    "inclusion of gas drag does not negate our finding that disk gravity from an eccentric disk leads to high encounter velocities between planetesimals , even of kilometer size .",
    "our results also clearly show that purely gravitational effects alone , in the absence of dissipative forces , can give rise to non - trivial behavior of @xmath39 ( see e.g.  [ sect : dd ] , [ sect : bd ] ) not captured in previous analyses of the problem .",
    "we also note that our assumed surface density profile ( [ eq : sigma])-([eq : sigma0 ] ) may not fully capture the distribution of @xmath18 in real disks . first",
    ", pressure forces drive differential precession in a hydrodynamical disk , which can be avoided only under rather special circumstances ( statler 2001 ) .",
    "second , these equations in their current form do not capture the possible presence of the density waves in the disk driven by the companion perturbation .",
    "they can be accounted for by assuming the apsidal angle @xmath27 of the fluid trajectories to vary with the distance in a particular fashion . for simplicity",
    "we did not consider such possibility in this work .",
    "however , even if the expressions ( [ eq : sigma])-([eq : sigma0 ] ) are only approximate , this does not change our main conclusions about the key role of the disk gravity .",
    "indeed , we find the values of @xmath101 and @xmath196 , which determine the disk effect on planetesimal dynamics , to not depend sensitively on the power - law indices @xmath49 and @xmath50 over a range of reasonable values , see figure [ fig : psi_pl ] .",
    "thus , we do not expect our results to change dramatically if the behavior of @xmath197 and @xmath104 were to deviate from the pure power laws in @xmath38 .",
    "finally , short - term variability of the disk surface density can induce fast - changing torques on planetesimals .",
    "these effects can not be captured by our secular ( time - averaged ) approach .",
    "however , we do not expect them to act coherently on long timescales and therefore to be subdominant for the same reason that the short - period terms of the planetary perturbations play an insignificant role on long time intervals in classical celestial mechanics ( murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "planetesimal growth requires relative velocities of colliding bodies to be small , otherwise they get eroded or destroyed .",
    "we use our results to provide some insights on planetesimal accretion in binaries .    for bodies held together primarily by gravity the threshold collision velocity at which planetesimals can still survive is about the escape speed .",
    "guided by this logic moriwaki & nakagawa ( 2004 ) and r13 use the simple criterion e > e_crit = & & 6.1 10 ^ -4   + & & ( ) ^1/2 [ ecrit ] as the condition for planetesimal destruction in collisions . here",
    "@xmath198 is the escape speed from a planetesimal of a given radius @xmath199 and @xmath200 is the bulk density of planetesimal material .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ecc_r ] we display @xmath201 by the dashed line and compare it with the characteristic @xmath39 attained by planetesimals as a result of disk+secondary gravitational perturbation for different disk models .",
    "one can see that in all models where disk eccentricity @xmath28 is high , comparable to the free - particle diskless eccentricity @xmath151 ( figure [ fig : ecc_r]a , b ) , the disk does not help eliminate the fragmentation barrier .",
    "this is because @xmath39 can not drop below @xmath28 and @xmath28 is high .",
    "the situation is clearly more helpful for planetesimal growth in lower-@xmath28 cases , see figure [ fig : ecc_r]c , d , even though it is still not as easy as in the case of axisymmetric disk studied in r13 . on the other hand , it has been noted in rafikov ( 2013b ) that the catastrophic destruction condition ( [ ecrit ] ) is likely too conservative and underestimates the ability of planetesimals to survive in mutual collisions .",
    "this issue is addressed in more detail in rafikov & silsbee ( 2014b ) .",
    "another potential problem that may arise in low - mass disks with @xmath135 is the presence of secular resonance in the disk , see  [ sect : ecc ] and figure [ fig : ecc_r ] .",
    "there @xmath39 becomes very large in a narrow range of @xmath38 , making planetesimal collisions highly destructive .",
    "this phenomenon is non - local since high-@xmath39 objects can penetrate other disk regions and destroy planetesimals there as well .",
    "however , this problem is unlikely to last for a long time as the small number of planetesimals from the vicinity of the secular resonance will be rapidly destroyed in collisions , leaving no more projectiles to destroy the remaining planetesimals in the rest of the disk .",
    "also , our inference of high-@xmath39 at secular resonance is based on linear secular equations ( [ eq : h_ev])-([eq : k_ev ] ) , which were derived under the assumption of @xmath202 , clearly not fulfilled at the resonance .",
    "the actual @xmath39 in this part of the disk will be different from our predictions .",
    "motivated by our results and their implications for planetesimal accretion we next discuss different scenarios ( in order of their likely significance ) in which relative velocities of planetesimals affected only by the gravity of gaseous disk and binary companion can be considerably lowered .      the major obstacle for planetesimal growth in high-@xmath28 disks has to do with our general result (  [ sect : ecc ] ) that @xmath39 is always above the smaller of @xmath163 and @xmath203 .",
    "thus , one of the most straightforward ways of lowering collision speeds is for the disk to have low @xmath28 either locally or globally for a long period of time .",
    "our current understanding of eccentricity excitation in gaseous disks is based primarily on the results of numerical simulations , which are reviewed in ",
    "[ sect : num_compare ] .",
    "we describe possible ways of lowering @xmath28 there .      when discussing the possibility of disk precession in ",
    "[ sect : precession ] we noted that the disk - induced contribution to the forced eccentricity can be effectively suppressed if the disk precesses faster than the planetesimals , i.e. if @xmath204 . in this case @xmath39 can easily be below @xmath205 .",
    "the remaining excitation due to the binary will keep @xmath39 at the level of @xmath206 , which is low because of the fast planetesimal precession driven by the massive disk , see  [ sect : db ] .",
    "thus , fast disk precession effectively brings planetesimal dynamics to the situation described in r13 and can serve as a mechanism for lowering planetesimal excitation , as long as gas drag can be neglected ( rafikov & silsbee 2014a ) .",
    "whether the gaseous disk can precess at the rate exceeding @xmath185 at separations of several au , where the giant planets are detected in close binaries , should thus be explored in more detail .      another way of making @xmath207 low",
    "is hinted to us by equation ( [ eq : dd_ecc ] ) , which shows that @xmath207 can be low even for high @xmath28 if @xmath48 is very small .",
    "the same is true for @xmath208 , see equation ( [ eq : bd_ecc ] ) .",
    "this is because the disk then produces zero contribution to the non - axisymmetric component of the disturbing function .",
    "figure [ fig : psi_pl ] shows that , ignoring the possible edge effects , this is possible e.g. if @xmath209 .",
    "our fiducial disk model based on general ideas about the accretion disk physics and their eccentricity excitation has @xmath59 and @xmath107 , which is not compatible with this condition .",
    "however , our present understanding of protoplanetary disks in binaries does not allow us to exclude disk models with @xmath209 .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath210 then the disk also has zero contribution to the axisymmetric component ; disk with @xmath211 ( i.e. uniform disk ) , @xmath107 affects neither planetesimal precession nor eccentricity excitation by its gravity in the absence of edge effects .    in figure",
    "[ fig : low_excit ] we show an example of one such model having @xmath212 and @xmath213 , with rather high disk eccentricity at the outer disk edge , @xmath214 ( for @xmath215 ) .",
    "one can clearly see that in this case @xmath207 is low and comparable to @xmath216 at @xmath217au separations .",
    "this should facilitate planetesimal growth on these scales .",
    "the disk - induced excitation for this model is not exactly zero due to edge effects .",
    "this is more of an issue near the outer edge of the disk because as shown in appendix [ sect : dist_fun ] ( and illustrated in figure [ fig : pl_phase ] ) @xmath218 is closer to the line of convergence at the outer edge than at the inner edge ) shows that for @xmath219 , @xmath220 as @xmath221 and @xmath222 as @xmath223 .",
    "this means that edge effects are more important in the outer disk for this set of power law indices .",
    "it is also worth noting that some ( though not all ) of the lower planetesimal eccentricity in this figure as compared to figure [ fig : ecc_r ] is due to lower assumed disk eccentricity @xmath28 in the inner part of the disk .",
    "however , the drop in @xmath39 as one moves away from the inner edge of the disk reflects the drop in the non - axisymmetric part of the disk disturbing function as the inner edge effect becomes less important and we see that @xmath39 drops well below the local value of @xmath28",
    ".      additionally , there are at least two ways in which @xmath39 can be reduced _ locally _ , within a narrow range of semi - major axes .",
    "first , even if the disk does not have @xmath209 _ globally _ , as we assumed in making figure [ fig : low_excit ] , there could be parts of the disk in which this condition in fulfilled for a range of @xmath38 , for example near the disk edges , where @xmath224 should be petering out to zero , or near dead zones or opacity transitions , where the material pileup is possible and a non - power law scaling of @xmath224 is likely .",
    "our results do not directly apply to such situations since we assumed a purely power law behavior of @xmath225 but based on them we can expect that it might be possible to have @xmath48 close to zero at radii , near which locally computed @xmath226 passes through @xmath227 ( edge effects mentioned in  [ sect : global_supp ] may make situation even more complicated ) . at this location contributions of the inner and outer disks to @xmath48 should nearly cancel each other resulting in low @xmath207 .",
    "of course , @xmath39 is lowered in this way only if the disk dominates eccentricity excitation , i.e. in the case dd .",
    "second , so far we have always assumed planetesimal eccentricity to be given by the characteristic value @xmath228 defined by the equation ( [ echar ] ) .",
    "this approach ignores the dependence of the actual maximum planetesimal eccentricity upon the relative disk - binary orientation , obvious from equation ( [ eq : e_p ] ) .",
    "in particular , in  [ sect : ev_eq ] we noted that whenever the conditions ( [ eq : low_e ] ) are fulfilled , the maximum eccentricity is much lower than @xmath228 .",

    "( 2013 ) , which neglects disk self - gravity and finds very high disk eccentricity .",
    "this observation is very relevant for our study since we find that massive disks give rise to lower planetesimal eccentricities if disk eccentricity @xmath28 can be reduced below the free - particle eccentricity @xmath151 , see  [ sect : ecc_behavior ] .",
    "lowering @xmath28 by the disk self - gravity would make massive disks even more attractive sites for planetesimal growth .",

    "although such systems are rare ( harris et al . 2012 ) there may be enough of them to explain a handful of known planet - hosting compact binaries .",
    "in this work we explored secular dynamics of planetesimals embedded in an eccentric gaseous disk , with implications for planet formation in binaries .",
    "we derived , for the first time , the analytical expression for the disturbing function of a body subject to gravity of a massive , eccentric , confocal and coplanar disk , in the limit when both the disk and planetesimal eccentricities are small ( appendix [ sect : dist_fun ] ) .",
    "this expression has been used in  [ sect : ev_eq ] to understand secular excitation of @xmath39 in presence of both the non - axisymmetric disk and the binary companion .",
    "assuming initially circular orbits and neglecting any dissipation ( such as due to gas drag ) in this work , we found the general analytical solution for the evolution of planetesimal eccentricity  equation ( [ eq : e_p ] )  which shows that @xmath39 oscillates from zero up to some maximum value .",
    "both period and amplitude of oscillations depend on properties of the disk and the secondary . depending on which agent  disk or secondary",
    " dominates planetesimal precession and eccentricity excitation , we find four distinct regimes for the @xmath39 behavior .",
    "two of them , in which gravity of eccentric disk dominates planetesimal eccentricity excitation , are novel results of this work .",
    "we have shown , in particular , that when the disk dominates both planetesimal precession and eccentricity excitation ( so called case dd , see  [ sect : dd ] ) characteristic planetesimal eccentricity @xmath39 is of order the local disk eccentricity @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath28 sets a lower limit on @xmath39 and essentially determines the characteristic collision speeds of planetesimals . as a result",
    ", we generally find that eccentricity of the disk presents a serious obstacle for the growth of planetesimals with sizes of less than several tens of km .",
    "we then discuss possible ways of lowering @xmath39 , which would be favorable for planetesimal growth (  [ sect : lowering_exc ] ) .",
    "one of them is for the disk to be massive , typically @xmath3 , so that ( 1 ) its own self - gravity reduces disk eccentricity @xmath28 as has been suggested by some simulations and ( 2 ) disk gravity dominates planetesimal dynamics .",
    "another possibility is for the disk to precess much faster than the precession rate of planetesimal orbits (  [ sect : precession ] ) .",
    "some other ways of lowering @xmath39 , both global and local ( within a finite range of separations ) are also described .",
    "these possibilities may represent pathways to planetesimal growth in at least a subset of protoplanetary disks in binary systems .    despite the neglect of dissipative effects such as gas drag ( accounted for in rafikov & silsbee 2014a ,",
    "b ) the present study demonstrates the variety of planetesimal dynamical behaviors driven by the coupled gravitational perturbations of an eccentric disk and the binary .",
    "it thus represents an important step in building a complete picture of planetesimal dynamics in binaries .    analytical description of the gravitational effects of the eccentric disk derived in this work ( appendix [ sect : dist_fun ] ) can be applied to a variety of other astrophysical problems : planetesimal dynamics in circumbinary disks ( silsbee & rafikov , in preparation ) , dynamics of self - gravitating gaseous and stellar disks , and so on .",

    "here we present a calculation of the disturbing function due to an eccentric disk .",
    "we assume that the disk eccentricity and surface density are given by the power law ansatz ( [ eq : sigma0 ] ) and apsidal angle is constant with radius .",
    "the latter assumption can be easily relaxed and analytical results obtained for @xmath27 varying as a power law of the semi - major axis of a fluid element .",
    "there are different ways in which such calculation can be approached .",
    "in particular , one can use the analogy with the gauss averaging method ( murray & dermott 1999 ) , which treats the time - averaged potential of a point mass on an eccentric orbit as that produced by an elliptical wire along the orbit with the line density proportional to the time the planet spends at each point of its orbit . in the case of a gaseous disk , we can consider fluid in a narrow elliptical annulus between the two adjacent fluid trajectories . because of the continuity equation the line density of this fluid along the annulus is also proportional to the time fluid spends at a given location .",
    "given that the density distributions are the same in two cases one can simply employ the expression for the disturbing function given by the gauss method .",
    "for example , secular contribution due to the outer disk becomes r^gauss_out = n_p^2 a_p^2 _ a_p^a_out da , [ eq : gauss ] where @xmath244 .",
    "similar expression can be written for the inner part of the disk as well",
    ". however , both @xmath245 and @xmath246 are non - convergent , as well as the sum of the inner and outer disk contributions in the vicinity of planetesimal orbit .",
    "this is a well - known problem with the gauss expression for the secular disturbing function ( murray & dermott 1999 ) . for this reason we are unable to use gauss method to calculate the disturbing function due to an eccentric disk for a planetesimal which is embedded in a disk with no gap .    instead",
    ", we have resorted to a different approach previously used by heppenheimer ( 1980 ) and ward ( 1981 ) to compute the gravitational field of an axisymmetric disk with power law surface density profile . to use this approach for an elliptical disk we had to come up with a number of important modifications .",
    "the idea behind this method is to compute the disturbing function directly as r(*s*)=g _ * s * , [ eq : r_gen ] where the integral is taken over the area of the disk @xmath247 , angle brackets @xmath248 represent time averaging over planetesimal orbital motion , @xmath249 is the ( time - dependent ) instantaneous radius of a planetesimal , @xmath250 is the angle between vectors @xmath251 and @xmath252 , see figure [ fig : geometry ] . according to this figure @xmath20",
