    "<S> we report on the first long - term application of squeezed vacuum states of light to improve the shot - noise - limited sensitivity of a gravitational - wave observatory . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , squeezed vacuum was applied to the german / british detector geo600 during a period of three months from june to august 2011 , when geo600 was performing an observational run together with the french / italian virgo detector . in a second period squeezing application continued for about 11 months from november 2011 to october 2012 . during this time , </S>",
    "<S> squeezed vacuum was applied for 90.2% ( 205.2 days total ) of the time that science - quality data was acquired with geo600 . </S>",
    "<S> sensitivity increase from squeezed vacuum application was observed broad - band above 400hz . </S>",
    "<S> the time average of gain in sensitivity was 26% ( 2.0db ) , determined in the frequency band from 3.7khz to 4.0khz . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a factor of two increase in observed volume of the universe , for sources in the khz region ( e.g. supernovae , magnetars ) . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce three new techniques to enable stable long - term application of squeezed light , and show that the glitch - rate of the detector did not increase from squeezing application . squeezed </S>",
    "<S> vacuum states of light have arrived as a permanent application , capable of increasing the astrophysical reach of gravitational - wave detectors .    </S>",
    "<S> gravitational waves were predicted by albert einstein as a consequence of his general theory of relativity @xcite , but have not been directly measured to date . while a number of large - scale laser - interferometers such as ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite , tama  @xcite , and geo600  @xcite , were ( or are , in the case of geo600 ) in operation , their sensitivities were not yet sufficient to make the first direct detection of gravitational waves ( gw ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the sensitivity limits of these instruments originates from the zero - point fluctuation of the quantum vacuum state of light . </S>",
    "<S> while this noise can in principle be reduced with respect to the signal size by the use of higher laser power , this method is ultimately limited by thermal deformation of optical components and other laser power related instabilities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was proposed by caves  @xcite that quantum noise in the shot - noise regime can also be reduced with the injection of squeezed vacuum states into the otherwise open output port of an interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> it took several years until squeezed - light sources became available and to demonstrate this principle on table - top interferometers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even more time was required to develop squeezed - light sources that made squeezed states at audio frequencies available , which is the frequency band relevant for the km - scale interferometers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> squeezing above the audio band was demonstrated in a prototype gw - interferometer  @xcite with suspended mirrors , and the first demonstration of quantum - enhancement in one of the gravitational - wave observatories was done in 2010 in the geo600 detector  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> squeezing of the ligo observatory in hanford , wa , was then demonstrated in late 2011  @xcite . while all of these experiments were one - time demonstrations of squeezed vacuum applied on time scales of minutes , in this work we report on the first continuous ( and ongoing ) application of squeezed light to a gravitational - wave interferometer , namely geo600 , to enhance the shot - noise limited sensitivity .    </S>",
    "<S> the geo detector is currently the only operational laser - interferometric gw detector worldwide and is acquiring calibrated measurement data in the so - called _ astrowatch _ mode . </S>",
    "<S> data taken in this mode covers about 2/3 of the total time , when regular work as part of an incremental upgrade program called _ geo - hf _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite does not take place . </S>",
    "<S> the search for gravitational - wave signals in the astrowatch data will be triggered only by the occurrence of external ( e.g. electromagnetic or neutrino ) signals , as expected e.g. from a supernova in our galaxy .        </S>",
    "<S> geo600  @xcite is a michelson interferometer with folded 600 m long arms , using the advanced technique of dual recycling  @xcite ( power- and signal recycling ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ geosetup ] shows a simplified layout of geo600 , together with the squeezed - light source  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezed states are injected into the main interferometer via a faraday isolator and must be mode - matched and aligned to the main interferometer beam . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , two servo systems ( denoted in fig .  [ geosetup ] as ` phase locked loop ' and ` squeezing phase feedback ' ) are necessary to assure the squeezing is at the correct optical laser frequency and detected interferometer output quadrature . through the implementation of three new techniques for alignment and squeezing phase control </S>",
    "<S> , we achieve a stable and long - term application of squeezed light to a gw observatory . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ strain_fig ] shows typical strain spectral densities of geo600 , comparing the non - squeezed noise floor with the squeezed noise floor , at the end of august 2012 . </S>",
    "<S> shot - noise reduction is observed at frequencies higher than about 400hz .        </S>",
    "<S> we apply an automatic alignment system for a squeezed vacuum field for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> because all of the geo600 core optics are suspended as pendula to reduce seismic perturbations , the alignment of the squeezed field into the interferometer must continuously follow the spatially drifting geo600 output field . </S>",
    "<S> an error signal for this control loop is derived by sensing the optical beat between the 15.2mhz frequency shifted squeezed vacuum control field  @xcite and the 14.9mhz michelson interferometer sidebands leaving the interferometer s dark port  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ geosetup ] . </S>",
    "<S> the servo feedback signals are sent to a 2-axis piezo actuated mirror , placed in the squeezing injection path , suppressing relative motions up to a frequency of 3hz .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we introduce a new control signal for the phase relation between the injected squeezed field and the interferometer output field . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an error signal using the detected light transmitted through the output mode - cleaner ( omc ) where the squeezing coherent control sidebands  @xcite beat with the spatially filtered geo600 carrier light ( tem00-mode ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of higher order modes in the filtered geo output beam , as well as the fact that all of the output tem00-mode carrier light is available to use , results in a superior error signal to shot noise ratio , as compared to previously used techniques . </S>",
    "<S> although the detected squeezing level is currently primarily limited by optical loss  @xcite , employing this new control signal already improves the strain sensitivity of geo 600 . as optical losses </S>",
    "<S> are reduced , which is foreseen during the geo - hf upgrade , phase noise will play a more significant role in limiting the detected squeezing level , thus making the benefits of this technique more important . </S>",
    "<S> the new control signal will also be of particular interest to the third generation laser interferometeric gw - detectors  @xcite where the goal is to detect up to 10db of squeezing .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the coherent control scheme for controlling the squeezer phase is extended to include a noise locking scheme  @xcite to compensate for slow drifts of the optimal squeezing angle . </S>",
    "<S> the implementation of this noise lock is similar to the one described in @xcite , but the combination with the coherent control scheme is used for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the demodulation phase of the squeezing phase control signal is electronically modulated at a frequency of 11.6hz . in order to maximize the detected </S>",
    "<S> squeezing level , as measured in a frequency band between 3.6khz and 5.4khz of the h(t ) data stream , a control loop with unity gain at about 10mhz corrects for drifts of the optimal demodulation phase over long timescales . </S>",
    "<S> the unity gain frequency of the coherent control loop is about 1khz .    </S>",
    "<S> the three new techniques described above were implemented in stages during two long - term geo600 science data taking periods . from june 3 to september 5 , 2011 , geo600 took part in an observational run , named s6e / vsr4 , together with the virgo detector . during the 93.3 days of this run , no detector commissioning work was performed . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> science - quality data were acquired for 84.3% ( 78.8 days ) of the total time , with squeezing applied for 53.1% ( 41.8 days ) of the science time . </S>",
    "<S> the average squeezing level observed in this period was 16% ( 1.3db ) .    in the second period lasting from november 17 , 2011 to october 15 , 2012 , the geo600 observatory took data in regular astrowatch mode . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the s6e / vsr4 run , we achieved a much higher squeezing application time , as well as an improved observed average squeezing level . </S>",
    "<S> the astrowatch time obtained in this period of 333 days was 68.2% ( 227.4 days ) with squeezed vacuum being applied for 90.2% ( 205.2 days ) of the astrowatch time with an average gain in detector sensitivity of 26% ( 2.0db ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the last two weeks of this period we achieved the highest duty factor so far : squeezing was applied to 99.66% of the astrowatch science - quality data , demonstrating the success of the new control techniques .        in order to characterise the effect of the squeezing application we look at the frequency dependent increase in sensitivity , as well as the stationarity of the data . </S>",
    "<S> we use the omega data analysis pipeline  @xcite for these investigations , which calculates the amplitude spectral density of 64-second data intervals , overlapping by 8 seconds , starting from the beginning of each science data segment . for the squeezing level estimation </S>",
    "<S> we compare this amplitude spectrum with the expected un - squeezed shot - noise amplitude spectrum , evaluating for the frequency range from 3692hz to 3957hz . </S>",
    "<S> this range is chosen as it is clean of spectral lines and other noise contributions , simplifying the long term calculation of the squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> however , the suppression is broadly the same in the 2khz to 6khz regime ( see also figure  [ strain_fig ] ) . figure  [ hist_fig ] shows the result for the period from november 17 , 2011 to october 15 , 2012 . </S>",
    "<S> the average gain in sensitivity from squeezed vacuum application in this period was 26% ( 2.0db ) . </S>",
    "<S> this improvement in sensitivity corresponds to an increase of the observable volume of the universe by a factor of two for gravitational - wave sources in this frequency band .    to investigate the noise behavior on short time scales ( i.e. 1 second and below ) </S>",
    "<S> the omega pipeline uses the 64s long spectra to whiten the data , and then performs a wavelet analysis to search for transients , which are thresholded and clustered into triggers . </S>",
    "<S> these transients , named glitches for our purpose , degrade our ability to detect potential gravitational - wave signals with similar time - frequency parameters . </S>",
    "<S> glitches occur in all gravitational - wave detectors and can have many different origins ( i.e. optical , electrical , etc . , see e.g.  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> any new technique added to a gravitational - wave detector should not increase the glitch rate , which would compromise the potential utility of the technology .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ glitch_fig ] shows histograms of signal - to - noise ratios for glitches detected during two 24 hour reference periods , one each for squeezing and no squeezing applied , constituting the first investigation of this kind . </S>",
    "<S> neither the rate nor outlier amplitude of the glitches was observed to increase for the interval with squeezing applied , compared with the time without the application of squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> this data without the application of squeezing was created intentionally to examine the effect of the squeezer on the glitch population in the detector data . </S>",
    "<S> no other deliberate attempt was made to set aside data without squeezing , but investigation of a similar data stretch from months earlier when squeezing was unavailable for technical reasons yielded consistent results .        </S>",
    "<S> we will continue to apply squeezed vacuum as much as possible during the next years , while also trying to increase the level of observed squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> currently , the main limitation in the level of observed squeezing comes from optical losses in the output - mode cleaner . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that we have demonstrated the application of squeezed vacuum states over a period of more than one year , enhancing the shot - noise limited sensitivity of a laser - interferometric gravitational - wave observatory . </S>",
    "<S> squeezed vacuum states are now regularly used at geo600 . </S>"
