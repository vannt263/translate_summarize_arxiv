    "the problem of constructing adequate statistical ensembles for non - equilibrium stationary states ( hereafter denoted by ness ) has a long history ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "related to it there are very interesting findings concerning the nature of fluctuations in the presence of spatial gradients inducing stationary flows @xcite . the computation of exact expressions for the probability distribution of simple ness allows to study different static properties as , for example , the long range density correlations @xcite",
    "the recent development of the theory of fluidized granular matter has also attracted a lot of attention to the structure of ness ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "finally , there is at present an important research carried on in order to properly define the entropy production accompanying stationary dissipative currents ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , whereas the modes of approach of fluids to thermal equilibrium are well understood , there is still no satisfactory theory of the dynamics of reaching ness . in both cases",
    "the final state is stationary , but in ness , in contradistinction to equilibrium , there persist non - vanishing fluxes sustained by the coupling to environment .",
    "the kinetic theory of fluids revealed the fundamental role of the separation between different time scales in the approach to equilibrium ( see e.g. the presentation of bogoliubov s ideas in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , in the evolution of the density of particles in the one - particle phase space all the degrees of freedom but those represented by the densities of globally conserved quantities relax at a short time scale producing a state close to local equilibrium .",
    "the subsequent slow evolution is essentially governed by changes of the hydrodynamic fields ( an original construction of the hydrodynamic modes within the kinetic theory has been developed by p. rsibois @xcite ) .",
    "one can wonder whether this kind of mechanism based on the time - scale separation still persists when the final state involves some dissipative stationary process related to the current flowing through the system .",
    "this is precisely the question we want to address in this paper .",
    "our object here is to exploit an analytically soluble one - dimensional model discussed in @xcite in order to perform a detailed study of the evolution towards a ness .",
    "although the system is very simple indeed , we find that the possibility of a rigorous study of its dynamics is precious from the point of view of the search for the laws governing the approach to ness . the coupling to the environment",
    "is represented in the model by the action of an external field .",
    "one of the original results of the paper is an explicit formula for the field dependent coefficient of diffusion governing the evolution of the only hydrodynamic mode in the approach to the stationary state .    in sec .",

    "when writing equation ( [ ke ] ) it has been supposed that the particles always encountered obstacles with velocities distributed according to ( [ phi ] ) .",

    "provided that appropriate boundary conditions are supplied at @xmath18 , equation ( [ dke ] ) has a non - equilibrium stationary solution representing a homogeneous ness whose velocity distribution @xmath19 , that can be chosen to be normalized as @xmath20 , has been derived and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the ness is characterized by a constant current @xmath21 that shows a linear response , @xmath22 , in the weak field limit @xmath23 and a non - linear response , @xmath24 , for strong fields @xmath25 .    whereas the paper @xcite focused on the properties of the stationary distribution ,",

    "the linear equation ( [ eqmus ] ) contains all information about the modes by which the system approaches the ness .",
    "whether these modes behave for long wavelengths as hydrodynamic modes is the question we want to study now . to this end",
    "we use the explicit solution of the boltzmann equation .",
    "the structure of ( [ solimplicit ] ) and ( [ eqmus ] ) implies that @xmath50 is an analytic function in the complex plane except at points @xmath42 where the inverse matrix @xmath51 does not exist .",
    "thus the zeros of the determinant @xmath52 define the singularities in the @xmath42-plane of the fourier - laplace transform @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , isolated zeros @xmath54 corresponding to simple poles will produce after applying the inverse laplace transformation an exponential time dependence of the form @xmath55 with coefficients @xmath56 for each mode depending on the initial condition ( @xmath57 denotes the spatial fourier transform of @xmath58 ) .",
    "we performed a systematic numerical survey of the zeros of the determinant @xmath52 for different values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "it has been found that regardless of the value of @xmath60 there is a single isolated zero which behaves like @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "all the other zeroes , both for finite @xmath59 and in the limit @xmath63 , have negative real parts and are located outside a band of a certain finite width around the imaginary axis .",
    "that is , these other zeros do not have an accumulation point with vanishing real part .",
    "therefore , for long wavelengths , there is exactly one slow diffusive mode ( coefficient @xmath64 ) combined with convective transport with velocity @xmath65 .",
    "all the others are fast kinetic modes .",
    "the presence of an unique slow mode is related to the fact that the mass is the only conserved quantity .",
    "no zeroes with positive real part were found , reflecting the fact that the ness is stable .",

[ fig.dv ] we plotted its dependence on @xmath60 , showing the transition from a linear to a nonlinear response .",
    "the explicit expression for the diffusion coefficient ( [ depsilon ] ) is quite involved . a plot of it is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.dv ] .",
    "it should be noticed that @xmath76 has an interesting structure as a function of the intensity of the external field showing a minimum for @xmath77 .",
    "the asymptotic formulae for small and large intensities are    @xmath78    it should be remarked that in the limit of vanishing external field the value @xmath79 coincides with that following at equilibrium ( @xmath80 ) from the green - kubo formula . for large values of @xmath60 ,",
    "the velocity of the obstacles becomes negligible compared to that acquired by accelerated motion and their action resembles that of stopping centers .",
    "therefore by purely dimensional analysis one can predict the exponent @xmath81 in the dependence of @xmath76 in ( [ squareroot ] ) .",
    "the appearance of a minimum in @xmath76 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.dv ] is an interesting point which calls for interpretation .",
    "the minimum can be understood by analyzing the partial collision frequencies with obstacles moving with velocities @xmath82 or @xmath83 . in the ness ,",
    "these collision frequencies are given by @xmath84 where the average is computed with the use of the ness distribution @xmath19 given in eq.(40 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.mu ] , the collision frequency @xmath85 with obstacles moving to the right ( in the direction of the accelerating field ) has a minimum at @xmath86 . in order to understand this fact consider a particle that has just collided with an obstacle with velocity @xmath83 getting instantaneously its velocity .",
    "if the field is weak , it will continue moving to the left encountering obstacles with velocity @xmath82 and will be sent again towards those with velocity @xmath83 the collision frequency @xmath85 remaining high . also if the field is large enough , the particle will turn rapidly to the right and gain a large velocity leading again to a large value of @xmath85 .",
    "there are however intermediate values of acceleration where the particle remains a long time turning to the right under the action of the field before the next collision occurs without getting large velocities and thus reducing the collision rate .",
    "this fact explains the origin of the minimum in @xmath87 .",
    "finally , the presence of the minimum in @xmath85 can be related to the observed minimum of @xmath76 because the lowering of the collision rate for a range of values of @xmath60 produces an evolution that is closer to a deterministic one , and thus less diffusive .    knowing the analytic solution of the initial value problem for the kinetic equation ( [ dke ] ) we could also verify if the diffusion coefficient ( [ depsilon ] ) follows from the green - kubo formula when the ness distribution is used in the evaluation of the autocorrelation function .",
    "we thus considered the green - kubo expression @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the solution of the equation ( [ dke ] ) with initial condition @xmath90 and @xmath65 is the ness drift velocity .",
    "the computation process is as follows .",
    "given the initial condition @xmath91 , the equation ( [ eqmus ] ) is solved for @xmath92 ( note that @xmath42 must be nonzero because otherwise the inverse matrix @xmath93 does not exist ) .",
    "then , @xmath94 is obtained and the coefficient @xmath95 can be found from the relation @xmath96 we performed the calculation obtaining a finite value which coincides with ( [ depsilon ] ) .",
    "we thus conclude that when the system is in the ness , both in the linear and in the nonlinear response regimes , the diffusion coefficient is given by the green - kubo formula provided the ness distribution is used in the averaging process and the fluctuations of the velocity around the non - zero mean value @xmath75 are considered .",
    "this conclusion is also confirmed by an analogous result obtained for a simpler one - dimensional case where only nonlinear transport is present @xcite .",
    "finally , we have checked that beyond the linear response regime the system does not obey the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , relating the diffusion coefficient @xmath64 and the mobility @xmath97 .",
    "the mobility is defined as @xmath98 .",
    "evaluating the non - equilibrium stationary temperature @xmath99 using the stationary distribution @xmath100 , it is directly checked that @xmath101 .",
    "the equality is only satisfied at the equilibrium case @xmath80 .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been predicted in granular gases @xcite .",
    "we have considered a one - dimensional system of particles absorbing energy from a constant and uniform external field , and dissipating it via collisions with a bath of scattering obstacles with a fixed velocity distribution ( [ phi ] ) . in this situation the appropriate linear boltzmann equation ( [ dke ] ) predicts the approach to a non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) characterized by a mass flux that can present both linear and nonlinear response depending on the strength of the field .",
    "it has been found that the evolution of arbitrary initial conditions toward the ness involves short time scale kinetic modes producing the stationary velocity distribution followed by the slow long wavelength hydrodynamic diffusion superposed on a convective current flowing with the average velocity of the ness .",
    "analytic calculations show an interesting structure in the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the intensity of the external field , with a minimum at intermediate values of the field .",
    "the minimum is related to the presence of another minimum in the collision frequency between the particles and the obstacles , thus reducing the number of randomizing scattering processes .",
    "furthermore , we have also shown that the value of the diffusion coefficient could be obtained from a green - kubo formula by considering the time displaced peculiar velocity correlation function ( subtracting the average ness velocity ) averaged over the ness distribution .",
    "it thus appears that the modes of approach to the ness when only the mass remains as a conserved quantity involve the corresponding single hydrodynamic mode which is the classical process of spatial diffusion .",
    "the diffusion coefficient does depend on the external field intensity and can be obtained at any value of the field from an appropriately generalized green - kubo formula .",
    "we conclude that the approach to ness shows qualitative analogy to that of reaching equilibrium .",
    "hopefully this conclusion remains valid for a large class of systems in which the stationary state results from the balance between the energy flow absorbed from an external field and collisional coupling to a kind of thermostat .",
