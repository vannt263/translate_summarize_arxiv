    "recently it was demonstrated that optical nanometric - thin cell ( ntc ) containing atomic vapor of alkali metal ( rb , cs , etc ) allows one to observe a number of spectacular effects , which are not observable in ordinary ( centimeter - length ) cells , particularly : 1 ) cooperative effects such as the cooperative lamb shift caused by dominant contribution of atom - atom interactions  @xcite ; 2 ) negative group index @xmath14 ( the largest negative group index measured to date ) caused by propagation of near - resonant light through a gas with @xmath15 thickness but many atoms per @xmath16  @xcite ; 3 ) broadening and strong shifts of resonances , which become significant when @xmath17  nm caused by atom - surface van der waals interactions due to the tight confinement in ntc  @xcite .",
    "+ atomic spectroscopy with ntcs was found to be efficient also for studies of optical atomic transitions in external magnetic field manifested in two interconnected effects : splitting of atomic energy levels to zeeman sublevels ( deviating from the linear dependence in quite moderate magnetic field ) , and significant change in probability of atomic transitions as a function of @xmath6-field  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of ntcs for quantitative spectroscopy of rb atomic levels in magnetic field up to @xmath18 has been shown recently  @xcite .",
    "these studies benefited from the following features of ntc : 1 ) sub - doppler spectral resolution for atomic vapor thickness @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath0 being the resonant wavelength of rb  @xmath4 or @xmath21 line , 795 or 780 nm , respectively ) needed to resolve large number of zeeman transition components in transmission or fluorescence spectra ; 2 ) possibility to apply strong magnetic field using permanent magnets : in spite of the strong inhomogeneity of @xmath6-field ( in our case it can reach @xmath22 ) , the variation of @xmath6-field inside atomic vapor is negligible because of the small thickness . +",
    "two considerations have been used for theoretical description of behavior of the atomic states exposed to strong magnetic field : coupled ( @xmath13 ) basis , and uncoupled ( @xmath23 ) basis , where @xmath9 is the total electronic angular momentum , @xmath10 is the nuclear spin momentum , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , are corresponding projections .",
    "the completely uncoupled basis is valid for strong magnetic field given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the ground - state hyperfine coupling coefficient , @xmath30 is the bohr magneton .",
    "this regime is called hyperfine paschen - back regime ( hpb )  @xcite .",
    "if we have an atom with the electronic angular momentum @xmath9 and nuclear spin @xmath10 , due to hyperfine interaction between the electronic and nuclear angular momentum , atomic fine structure levels are split into the hyperfine components represented by the total angular momentum @xmath31 .",
    "if an external magnetic field is applied coupling between electronic and nuclear angular momentum gradually is destroyed and finally at a very strong magnetic field both electronic and nuclear angular momenta interact with the magnetic field independently .",
    "this means that at a very weak magnetic field the most convenient way to describe an atom in a magnetic field is a coupled basis approach which assumes that both angular momenta are strongly coupled .",
    "this approach is called coupled basis formalism and it uses the basis which we will represent in a form    @xmath32    where @xmath27 is the magnetic quantum number for hyperfine momentum .    in contrary in a very strong magnetic field when both angular momenta are totally uncoupled the most convenient is the uncoupled bases approach when the eigenfunctions of an atomic state can be represented as    @xmath33    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the magnetic quantum numbers for electronic and nuclear angular momentum respectively .    of course , both basis according to the quantum angular momentum theory are related via @xmath34 symbols in a simple way @xcite    latexmath:[\\ ] ] ( as @xmath144 , we ignore @xmath145 contribution ) , which coincides well with the experiment .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] four transitions of @xmath3rb labeled @xmath146 are shown for the case of @xmath104 polarized laser excitation for the hpb regime ( selection rules : @xmath118 ) .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of frequency shift for these components is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "the red curves @xmath146 are calculated by the coupled basis theory , and the black lines @xmath147 and @xmath148 are calculated by the hpb theory , eq.(12 ) .",
    "symbols represent the experimental results .",
    "similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] and for the same reason , drastic difference between the two models is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] for weak magnetic field , with tendency to converge as the @xmath6-field increases .",
    "however , the curves converge at significantly higher magnetic field ( @xmath149  t ) required to decouple the nuclear and electronic spins for @xmath3rb having larger hyperfine splitting .",
    "it is important to note that also for four transitions of @xmath3rb , the slope @xmath141 is nearly the same as for @xmath2rb ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the expression for @xmath141 contains values of @xmath151 and @xmath152 which are the same for @xmath2rb and @xmath3rb , but does not contain @xmath29 values for @xmath153 state that are strongly different .",
    "+ it is worth noting that the complete hpb regime for cs  @xmath21 line having the same ground state @xmath29 value as for @xmath3rb , has been observed in  @xcite at @xmath154  t. thus , one may expect that also for @xmath3rb the complete hpb regime appears for @xmath155 .",
    "advantages of  @xmath1-method \" addressed in section  [ subsec : lambdamethods ] make it convenient to separate closely spaced individual atomic transitions in an external magnetic field . in order to compare",
    " @xmath1-method \" and `` @xmath0-method '' ( based on vsop resonance ) , we have combined in fig .  [ fig : fig8 ] the spectra obtained by these methods at @xmath156 , keeping the previous labeling of individual transitions of @xmath2rb and @xmath3rb .",
    "let us discuss the distinctions of  @xmath1-method \" versus  @xmath0-method \" .",
    "first , it requires @xmath157 orders    -method \" ( upper graph ) and  @xmath1-method \" ( lower graph ) for @xmath158  t. ]    less laser radiation intensity . in the case of low absorption ( a few percent ) , the absorption @xmath159 is proportional to @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the absorption cross - section and is proportional to @xmath162 ( @xmath163 being the dipole moment matrix element ) , @xmath164 is the atomic density , and @xmath71 is the thickness .",
    "thus , directly comparing @xmath165 ( peak amplitudes of the absorption of the @xmath166-th transition ) , it is straightforward to estimate the relative probabilities ( line intensities ) .",
    "meanwhile for vsop - based method the linearity of the response has to be verified .",
    "moreover , spatial resolution is twice better for @xmath20 as compared with @xmath19 , which can be important when strongly inhomogeneous magnetic field is applied . on the other hand ,",
    "method based on vsop provides 5-fold better spectral resolution .",
    "thus , the two methods can be considered as complementary depending on particular requirements .",
    "note that it is easy to switch from @xmath1 to @xmath0 in experiment just by vertical translation of the ntc .      in the frame of coupled basis for @xmath7 laser excitation ,",
    "there are twenty atomic transitions for @xmath2rb according to the selection rules .",
    "it should be noted that for @xmath167 and @xmath7 excitation all the twenty atomic transitions of @xmath2rb have been recorded in  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] shows the transition probabilities versus @xmath6 for nine @xmath168 transition components under @xmath7 excitation ( see the labeled diagram in the inset ) .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] that the probabilities of transitions @xmath169 increase , and probabilities of transitions @xmath170 decrease with @xmath6 , and for @xmath8 only @xmath95 transitions @xmath171 remain in the spectrum .",
    "transitions of @xmath2rb  @xmath4 line labeled in the inset versus @xmath6 for the case of @xmath172 excitation . ]",
    "similarly , the probabilities of eleven components of @xmath173 transitions versus @xmath6 for the case of @xmath172 excitation are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] . here",
    "only the probability of the transition labeled 9 increases with @xmath6 , remaining the only component in the spectrum for @xmath174  t.     transitions of @xmath2rb  @xmath4 line labeled in the inset versus @xmath6 for the case of @xmath172 excitation . ]    thus , also in the frame of the coupled basis six transitions remain in @xmath2rb  @xmath4 line spectrum at @xmath8 for @xmath172 excitation .",
    "+ although the experimental results obtained for strong magnetic field are found to be in consistency with an uncoupled basis model ( hpb regime ) and can be described by simple theoretical expressions as is shown in section  [ sec : theory ] , however there are some cases when the coupled basis is to be used .",
    "particularly , it was revealed in  @xcite that @xmath175 transition  forbidden \" at @xmath87 due to the selection rule @xmath176 appears in the transmission spectrum of @xmath3rb  @xmath21 line at strong magnetic field .",
    "even for @xmath12 , the probability of this transition calculated in the coupled basis is not negligible and can be easily detected .",
    "four atomic transitions of @xmath3rb in hpb regime were presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] . in the frame of coupled basis @xmath177 for @xmath7 laser excitation",
    "there are twelve atomic transitions according to the selection rules , which are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] .",
    "the transitions labeled @xmath178 and @xmath98 ( shown also in fig .  [ fig : fig7 ] ) are depicted by solid lines , and other transitions absent for hpb case are presented by dashed lines .",
    "note that for weak magnetic field ( @xmath179 ) in the case of @xmath7 excitation all twelve atomic transitions of @xmath3rb have been detected in  @xcite . in order to find out",
    "which atomic transitions will remain in a strong magnetic field regime , it is needed to calculate the magnetic field - dependent probabilities for all the twelve atomic transitions .",
    "[ fig : fig12 ] shows the dependence of the probabilities of atomic transitions @xmath180 on magnetic field for @xmath7 laser excitation .",
    "it is clearly seen that only transitions @xmath178 remain in the spectrum for @xmath130  t.    rb  @xmath4 line transitions in the frame of coupled basis for @xmath7 laser excitation ; the selection rules : @xmath181 . ]    , @xmath182 and @xmath183 for @xmath7 laser excitation versus magnetic field . ]",
    "the same dependence for transitions labeled @xmath184 and @xmath98 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] . here",
    "only transition 10 remains at @xmath8 .     and",
    "@xmath98 for @xmath7 laser excitation versus magnetic field . ]",
    "thus , both models give the same result : only transitions @xmath178 and @xmath98 remain at a strong magnetic field",
    ". however , the hpb model is advantageous , being simple and easy for calculations .",
    "it is demonstrated that simple and efficient  @xmath0-method \" and  @xmath1-method \" based on nanometric - thickness cells filled with alkali metal atoms allow to study behavior of atomic zeeman transitions of @xmath2rb , @xmath3rb  @xmath4 lines in a wide range of magnetic field from @xmath62  mt to @xmath62  t. particularly , for the case of @xmath104 polarized laser radiation and @xmath8 , only 6 transitions remain in the transmission spectrum of @xmath2rb  @xmath4 line , and only @xmath157 transitions remain in @xmath3rb spectrum . for @xmath120",
    "t the expression , which is valid in the frame of uncoupled basis ( hyperfine paschen - back regime ) , describes very well the experimental results for @xmath2rb atomic transitions .",
    "the latter is important for the determination of such parameters as : the atomic transitions frequency position and frequency separation of the components ; the slope @xmath141 in dependence of atomic transition components frequency on magnetic field can be easily calculated with an inaccuracy of @xmath140 . for @xmath3rb having larger hyperfine splitting ,",
    "the experimental results are very well described in the frame of coupled basis , meanwhile the uncoupled basis model yields inaccuracy of @xmath100 10@xmath86 for the range of @xmath185 .",
    "consistency of the two models for @xmath3rb are expected to reach at @xmath186  t. + it is worth noting that calculations of magnetic field dependence of zeeman transition probabilities and frequency positions for the case of @xmath104 polarized laser radiation performed in the frame of the coupled basis model are fully consistent with experimental results for all the atomic transitions of @xmath2rb  @xmath4 line ( twenty transitions ) and @xmath3rb  @xmath4 line ( twelve transitions ) in a broad range of magnetic field ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "such calculations will be of interest also for cs , k , na , li .",
    "+ the results of this study can be used to develop hardware and software solutions for magnetometers with nanometric ( 400  nm ) local spatial resolution and widely tunable frequency reference system based on a ntc and strong permanent magnets .",
