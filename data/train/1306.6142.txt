    "the answer , according to the consistent histories approach to quantum theory pioneered by griffiths @xcite , omnes @xcite , gell - mann and hartle @xcite , halliwell @xcite and others @xcite , is when  and only when  the quantum interference between the histories corresponding to those statements vanishes .",
    "a framework of this kind is essential to the quantum theory of gravity applied to the universe as a whole because the universe is a closed quantum system .",

    "quantum theory simply has no prediction concerning such histories .",
    "more pointedly , in quantum theory _ there can be no logically consistent prediction _ for these particular histories in this experimental configuration . ]",

    "decoherence functional_. the decoherence functional , constructed from the system s quantum state , both measures the interference between histories in a complete set of alternative possibilities , and , when that interference vanishes between all members of such a set , determines the probabilities of each such history .",
    "this framework reproduces the ordinary quantum quantum mechanics of measured subsystems in situations to which it applies , but generalizes it to situations in which it does not , such as when applying quantum theory to a closed system such as the universe as a whole .    in previous work @xcite",

    "a key prediction of lqc is the existence of a bounce of the physical volume ( or the scale factor ) of the universe when the energy density of the matter content ( in the present case , the scalar field @xmath1 ) reaches a universal maximum @xmath2 in the isotropic models .",
    "the existence of a bounce was first obtained for the model under consideration @xcite , and since then has been confirmed for a variety of matter models , using sophisticated numerical simulations .",
    "these numerical simulations show that semi - classical states peaked at late times on classical expanding trajectories , bounce in the backward evolution ( in ` internal time ' @xmath1 ) to a classical contracting branch . since the inner product , physical hilbert space and a set of dirac observables are completely known , the detailed physics can be extracted and reliable predictions can be made .",

    "this model , dubbed slqc , serves as an important robustness check of various predictions in loop quantum cosmology .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that the bounce occurs for all the states in the physical hilbert space , and the energy density is bounded above by the same universal maximum @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "all of these studies , though , address in practice only questions concerning _ individual _ quantum events , for example , the density or volume ( of a fiducial spatial cell of the universe ) at a given value of internal time .",

    "@xcite , conclusions drawn from such individual quantum events can be in certain situations badly misleading as a guide to probabilities for _ sequences _ of quantum occurrences  _ histories _ of the universe ",

    "the question is , when does the _ amplitude _ for a sequence of quantum events correspond to the _ probability _ for that particular history ?",

    "it is perhaps an understatement to observe that the philosophical challenges presented by the effort to apply quantum theory to closed systems  particularly , the universe as a whole  do not end with questions of consistency of histories or decoherence .",
    "a fundamental challenge to the program is to offer a coherent account of the physical meaning of the probabilities at which one consistently arrives @xcite .",

    "in this section , we briefly outline the quantization of a spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic spacetime in loop quantum cosmology .",
    "a complete loop quantization of this model sourced with a massless , minimally coupled scalar field @xmath1 was first provided in refs.@xcite , and the model was demonstrated in ref.@xcite to be exactly solvable in the `` harmonic gauge '' @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the scale factor of the universe described by the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a flat fiducial metric on the spatial slices @xmath8 . in loop quantum cosmology the quantization procedure parallels that of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) .",

    "see ref.@xcite for a brief discussion of this point . ] and @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively denote a fiducial triad and co - triad compatible with the fiducial metric .",
    "( in these variables the physical volume of the fiducial cell is @xmath18 . ) for the massless scalar field model , the matter phase space variables are @xmath1 and its conjugate momentum @xmath19 . in terms of these phase space variables ,",

    "there exist two disjoint solutions , one expanding and the other contracting , with a fixed value of @xmath19 . in the limit @xmath34",
    "the expanding branch encounters a big bang singularity in the past evolution , whereas in the limit @xmath35 the contracting branch encounters a big crunch singularity in the future evolution .",
    "these singularities are reached in a finite proper time , and _ all _ the classical solutions are singular .",
    "we now summarize the quantization procedure for this model in loop quantum cosmology in brief . as in lqg ,",
    "the fundamental variables for quantization of the gravitational sector are the holonomies of the connection and the fluxes of the triads . due to spatial homogeneity",
    ", the fluxes turn out to be proportional to the triads themselves @xcite , whereas the holonomies of the connection , along straight edges labelled by @xmath36 , are given by @xmath37 where the @xmath38 are the pauli spin matrices .",
    "the matrix elements of the holonomies generate an algebra of almost periodic functions of the connection , the representation of which , found via the gelfand - naimark - segal contruction , supplies the kinematical hilbert space .",
    "it turns out that even at the kinematical level , the quantization of this model in lqc is strikingly different from that of the wheeler - dewitt theory .",

    "a generic state in the kinematical hilbert space of lqc can be expressed as a countable sum of orthonormal eigenfunctions ( matrix elements of holonomies ) .",
    "the matrix elements of the holonomies act on states in the volume ( or the triad ) representation as translations . if @xmath43 denotes the eigenstates of the volume operator , which has the action @xmath44 , then elements of the holonomies act as @xmath45 .",
    "here @xmath46 is a parameter determined by the underlying quantum geometry , and is given by @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "a consequence is that the action of the hamiltonian constraint operator , expressed in terms of the holonomies , on the states in the volume representation does not lead to a differential equation , but rather to a difference equation in which the discreteness scale is determined by the parameter @xmath46 . for the total hamiltonian constraint @xmath48",
    ", the resulting difference equation is given by    @xmath49    [ eq : theta ]    where the gravitational part of the constraint @xmath50 is a self - adjoint , positive definite operator .",

    "an additional requirement on the physical states @xmath58 arises by noting that in the absence of fermions , physics should be independent of the orientation of the triad",
    ". we can thus choose physical states to be symmetric under this change , which therefore satisfy @xmath59 .",
    "because of the symmetry of the physical states and observables under changes of orientation of the triad , we will as applicable treat @xmath23 as positive in the sequel .    in order to extract physics ,",
    "we introduce a set of dirac observables .",
    "these are the volume of the fiducial cell at time @xmath60 , and the conjugate momentum @xmath19 , which have the following action ( consistent with the inner product ) : @xmath61 using these observables ,",
    "it is straightforward to also introduce an energy density observable , which turns out to have expectation values bounded above by a critical density @xmath3 for all the states in the physical hilbert space @xcite . analysis of these observables in slqc , in confirmation with the earlier results in lqc obtained using numerical simulations @xcite , show that the expectation value of the volume observable has a minimum which is reached when the energy density reaches its maximum value .",
    "this is the quantum bounce in slqc .",
    "our goal is now to understand the occurrence of a bounce in slqc using the consistent histories approach , which is addressed in the following .",

    "moreover , as noted , the construction of class operators , branch wave functions , and the decoherence functional for slqc precisely mirrors that of the wheeler - dewitt theory . in this section , therefore , we restrict ourselves to a concise summary of the definitions and main formul , referring the reader to ref .",

    "( ii ) the _ coarse - grained histories _ , a specification of the allowed partitions of the fine - grained histories into physically meaningful subsets .

    "( iii ) the _ decoherence functional _ provides an objective , observer - independent measure of the quantum interference between alternative coarse - grained histories of a system .",
    "when that interference vanishes among all members of a coarse - grained family , that set is said to `` decohere '' , or to `` be consistent '' . in that case , and in that case only , does the decoherence functional assign logically consistent probabilities  in the sense that probability sum rules are satisfied  to the members of each consistent set of histories .",
    "any specific implementation of a generalized quantum theory must realize these elements in a coherent and mathematically consistent way . in formulations of quantum theory in hilbert space , fine - grained histories can be specified by ( for example ) time - ordered products of heisenberg projections onto eigenstates of physical observables , representing the history in which the system assumes those particular values of those particular observables at those particular times .",
    "coarse - grained histories are represented by sums of such fine - grained histories .",
    "`` branch wave functions '' corresponding to the state of a system that has followed a particular coarse - grained history are defined by the action of these history ( or `` class '' ) operators on the quantum state .",
    "the decoherence functional , which measures the interference between alternative histories , and also the probabilities of histories in consistent or decoherent families as determined by the absence of such interference , can be defined by the physical inner product between branch wave functions .    in the consistent histories",

'' `` does the volume of the cell ever drop below a particular value , let us say @xmath67 ? '' `` is the momentum of the scalar field conserved during evolution ?",

    "( [ eq : csingdef ] ) and ( [ eq : pppsi ] ) , we find that the branch wave function for an slqc quantum universe to encounter the singularity vanishes , @xmath251 on the other hand , the branch wave function for the history corresponding to a bounce in slqc is @xmath252 thus , the family of histories @xmath253 in slqc decoheres , @xmath254 and a bounce is predicted with probability 1 ,    @xmath255    [ eq : dbb ]    note that in this analysis , no assumption has been made on the the choice of state @xmath69 , and thus this result holds for all states in the theory .",
    "thus , we have shown in the consistent histories approach that the bounce is a universal feature of all states in slqc .",
    "we finally note that the existence of bounce at a non - zero volume is tied to the existence of an upper bound on the expectation values of the energy density operator of the scalar field : @xmath256 .",
    "for more discussion , see refs.@xcite . unlike the wheeler - dewitt theory , in slqc the spacetime curvature thus never diverges during the evolution .",
    "the essence of quantum superposition is that independent reality can not be assigned to the elements of that superposition unless interference among them vanishes . in the language of",
    "consistent or decoherent histories `` generalized '' quantum mechanics , physical probabilities can not be inferred from the transition amplitudes unless the corresponding family of histories is consistent , as emphasized in @xcite . for a closed quantum system , therefore , it is essential to have available an internally consistent measure of quantum interference in order to be able to arrive at meaningful quantum predictions .    in a closed system such as the universe as a whole , an objective measure of quantum interference",
    "is provided by the system s decoherence functional .",
    "construction of the decoherence functional is therefore an essential component of any quantum theory of gravity in which one intends to apply the theory to the whole universe , as in quantum cosmology .",
    "the point of view of the decoherent or consistent histories framework as applied here may be sufficiently unfamiliar to some that it is important to emphasize that , in almost every respect , it is simply `` quantum mechanics as usual '' .",
    "the single  but crucial ",
    "new concept is the addition of the decoherence functional to the technical and interpretational apparatus of quantum theory .",
    "the decoherence functional is essentially an extension of the concept of quantum state to provide an objective , internally consistent measure of quantum interference , thus replacing the vague criterion of measurement by external classical observers with a rigorously formulated measure that reproduces the results of classical measurement theory when it is applicable , but extends it to situations when it is manifestly , and profoundly , * not * applicable  crucially , to closed systems for which the notion of external measurements is clearly meaningless .",
    "simple examples of the necessity for such an extension are easy to come by in quantum gravity . for example , how is one to assign probabilities to the quantum density fluctuations that putatively lead to the large scale cosmological structure we observe today when no classical systems existed to `` observe '' them",
    "?    the focus on `` histories '' may also give the framework an unfamiliar feel .",
    "however , it is precisely for making predictions concerning _ sequences _ of quantum outcomes that ordinary measurement - based formulations of quantum mechanics have no answers , no predictions , for closed quantum systems .",
    "yet , patterns of correlations between observable quantities  paths , or `` histories '' of those observables ",
    "are precisely the kind of quantities in which one is principally interested in cosmology .",
    "the decoherent histories framework provides a consistent and rigorous foundation for calculating quantum probabilities , whether for single quantum events , or sequences thereof , in terms of quantum amplitudes given by the system s state and physical inner product . in a properly formulated generalized quantum theory of cosmology , the physical meaning",
    "of the `` wave function of the universe '' is unambiguous ; there is no need to rely on heuristic arguments @xcite to extract physical predictions @xcite .",
    "the methodology for quantum prediction is precise and clear .",
    "we noted in the introduction that the interpretation of the meaning of probability in quantum theory quite generally  not only in the quantum mechanics of closed systems",
    " remains controversial .",
    "notwithstanding , we are not reluctant to write down expressions for quantum probabilities such as those found in sec .  [",
    "sec : apps ] with the expectation that their interpretation is as clear in context as it ever is in quantum mechanics . in recognition",
    "nonetheless of the special status of closed systems , we focus particular attention on quantum predictions which are certain , those for which the probabilities are 1 or 0  or close to it . for such predictions ,",
    "the meaning of the probabilities is unambiguous : the universe either will ( or will not ) exhibit the property ( or history ) in question .",
    "if observation contradicts this prediction , the theory is simply incorrect .",
    "( hartle @xcite and sorkin @xcite in particular have emphasized the special role played by such certain predictions in the quantum theory of closed systems . )    in an exactly solvable model of loop quantum cosmology ( slqc ) @xcite , for example , we have shown in a quantum mechanically consistent way that _ all _ states in the theory  whether peaked on classical trajectories at large volume or not  `` bounce '' in the sense that the universe must have a large volume in the limit of large @xmath143 . in stark contrast to the corresponding classical model , and also to its older wheeler - dewitt - type quantization , these quantum universes are not drawn into an infinite density singularity , and indeed , can not be .",
    "the role of the large-@xmath143 limit in our predictions is worth comment . as noted in passing in sec .",
    "[ sec : bounce ] , for a given state @xmath69 it is certainly possible that the histories described by @xmath257 and @xmath247 will decohere to a high degree of approximation at finite @xmath258 . indeed",
    ", wide classes of states such as states which are semi - classical at late times , i.e.  peaked on classical trajectories at large volume , will do so .",
    "however , it is only in the limit that @xmath143 becomes large that _ all _ states , no matter how `` quantum '' ( with no peakedness properties ) , are guaranteed to decohere and exhibit a quantum bounce .",
    "this is the role of the limit : it is in this limit we arrive at a _ universal _ , and certain , prediction of slqc  including both decoherence and unit probability ",
    "valid for all states .",
    "the bounce is a robust , universal prediction of slqc . above . ]",
    "it is of course the case that it was rigorously shown in ref.@xcite that the matter density remains bounded above for all states in the theory ( in the domain of the relevant physical operators . ) here , we complement this result and add a little more .",
    "first , as emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite , the physical question of whether a quantum universe exhibits a `` bounce '' is fundamentally a prediction about the correlation of the volume with ( at least ) two different values of the scalar field  at two different emergent ` times ' .",
    "it is precisely for such predictions that the question of the decoherence of the corresponding histories becomes critical .",
    "here we have shown that the coarse - grained histories describing a bounce do indeed decohere and predict a bounce with probability 1 .",
    "this actually goes further than the assertion that the matter density remains bounded above .",
    "in fact , we showed that for arbitrary choice of volume @xmath139 , the branch wave function @xmath259 describing a universe with volume @xmath260 in @xmath181 $ ] becomes 0 as @xmath178 , complementing the result of ref .",
    "@xcite that the expectation value of the volume becomes infinite in those limits for all states .",
    "the fact that @xmath139 is completely arbitrary implies that _ all _ quantum states in slqc will eventually end up at large volume , and therefore , be described by a superposition of wheeler - dewitt quantum states in that regime @xcite .",
    "( of course , that does not mean all states behave quasiclassically if the state is highly quantum .",
    "it only means that slqc passes over to the wheeler - dewitt quantum theory at large volume , and that that limit obtains for every loop quantum state for some range of large @xmath143 . for a detailed analysis of the precise sense in which slqc approximates the wheeler - dewitt theory ,",
    "see ref .",
    "this rules out , for example , the possibility of a highly quantum state that lingers indefinitely near the `` big bang '' ( i.e.  at large matter density ) .",
    "consistent with the prediction that all states `` bounce '' , as noted all states in slqc look like a particular symmetric superposition of expanding and collapsing wheeler - dewitt universes at large volume @xcite . while this is certainly a _ necessary _ condition for a theory",
    "in which a bounce is a generic feature , one may be led to inquire whether the presence of this superposition is in some sense the _ reason _ for the bounce .",
    "the answer is definitely `` no '' .",
    "in fact , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a superposition of expanding and contracting universes in the wheeler - dewitt quantization of this same physical model does not , and indeed _ can not _ bounce : all states are sucked in to the singularity at large @xmath143 . if a physical reason for the bounce is to be sought , it is in the `` quantum repulsion '' generated at small volume in loop quantum gravity , and manifested in this model in the ultraviolet cutoff in the dynamical eigenfunctions @xcite , not in the superposition of large expanding and contracting classical universes .",
    "we have so far exhibited the construction of a generalized decoherent - histories quantum theory in two mathematically complete quantizations of cosmological models , slqc in this analysis , and the corresponding wheeler - dewitt model in an earlier work @xcite , demonstrating how these theories may be used to arrive at quantum mechanically consistent physical predictions . in both of these models , the presence of an internal time , a monotonic physical clock provided by the scalar field in the canonical quantization of the models , simplified the construction of the generalized quantum theories through the structural analogy with ordinary quantum particle mechanics .",
    "is this feature essential to the construction of a generalized quantum theory ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "a path integral formulation for a closed bianchi model was studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein , and upon which much of the present work is based .",
    "more rigorously , we have now constructed along the same lines the generalized quantum theory for a path - integral ( spin foam ) quantization @xcite of the same physical model ( flat scalar frw ) as studied here @xcite .",
    "this will again be employed to study the same physical questions examined here , in particular , the quantum behavior near the classical singularity .",
    "this example shows that the presence of an internal time in the model , while convenient , is not essential to the formulation of its class operators , branch wave functions , and decoherence functional . taken together , these examples lay the foundation for the construction and application of generalized quantum theories  the quantum theory of closed physical systems  in quantum cosmology and quantum gravity more broadly .",
