    "the goal of this work is to investigate the propagation of electromechanical induced waves in a dielectric elastomer ( de ) layer subjected to finite deformations . in the purely elastic case",
    "the first solution for surface waves based on the exact equations of ( 2d ) elasticity was introduced by lord @xcite in 1887 , who determined the so - called rayleigh waves .",
    "this work was later extended for propagation of waves in elastic plates by lord @xcite himself and @xcite . here",
    "we extend the rayleigh - lamb problem and account for incremental motions superimposed on finite deformations in dielectric media , and investigate how these are influenced by the presence of external electric field and pre - stretch .    when subjected to an electric field electroactive polymers ( eaps )",
    "deform and both their mechanical and electrical properties are modified .",
    "in contrast to piezoelectric ceramics , des are capable of undergoing large deformations , a property that entitled them the name artificial muscles .",
    "moreover , while in piezoelectricity the electromechanical coupling is linear , in des the mechanical field depends quadratically on the electric fields . a proper theory , which accounts for the aforementioned coupling and captures the ability of the material to undergo finite strains is therefore required .",
    "the foundations of this nonlinear electroelastic theory are summarized in the pioneering works of @xcite and @xcite for the static case .",
    "these contributions were later extended by @xcite to account for the dynamics of these elastic dielectrics .",
    "a comprehensive summary can be found in monographs by @xcite and @xcite . due to",
    "the development of new materials that admit this coupled behavior , thus branching toward a window of new applications ( e.g. , , and @xcite ) , the interest in these electroelastodynamic theories revived recently and the coupled electromechanical theory was revisited recently .",
    "the foregoing works and their extension to the domain of soft dielectric composites by and @xcite , differ in their constitutive formulations , the choice of the independent variables , the resultant electrostatic stress - like tensors and electric body - like forces . for a review of the diverse formulations of the constitutive laws and governing equations",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite . among the various approaches we recall the formulation proposed by for the static case , and its extension to dynamics by @xcite . in these",
    "works the concept of total stress tensor that is derived from a total or augmented energy - density function was employed . in this work",
    "we follow the framework proposed by the latter .",
    "in contrast with the relatively large body of theoretical works that are available , only a few boundary - value problems ( bvp ) were solved in the context of the dynamic behavior of electromechanically coupled eaps .",
    "one of the first contributions in the field of piezoelectricity was made by @xcite , who examined the thickness vibrations of an infinite piezoelectric plate induced by alternating voltage at the surface electrodes , and later solved the corresponding problem of wave propagation @xcite . to the best of the authors knowledge ,",
    "while for piezoelectric media solutions for bvp accounting for the influence of pre - strain and bias field are available ( see review article by @xcite ) , analogue developments in the context of dielectrics were considered by and @xcite , who examined the dynamic behavior of dielectric elastomer balloons , and by @xcite who studied the problem of propagation of rayleigh surface waves in a dielectric half - space . herein we continue along the path of the latter contribution and consider the extension of the rayleigh - lamb wave propagation problem to finitely deformed dielectric layers subjected to coupled electromechanical loading .",
    "the work is composed as follows . in section 2 the theory of finite electroelastodynamics is summarized .",
    "the equations for incremental motions superimposed on finite deformations are outlined in section 3 .",
    "specific finite deformations that correspond to three different loading configurations are considered in section 4 for a layer whose behavior is characterized by a particular augmented energy - density function ( aedf ) , namely the _ incompressible dielectric neo - hookean _ model ( dh ) .",
    "next , the extension of the rayleigh - lamb dispersion relation for a dh layer is introduced in section 5 .",
    "an analysis of the dispersion relation is carried out in section 6 , and the effects of the bias electrostatic field and pre - stretch are investigated for the three loading configurations . the main conclusions and observations are summarized in section 7 .",
    "let @xmath0 describe the motion of a material point @xmath1 from a reference configuration of a body @xmath2 , with a boundary @xmath3 , to its current configuration @xmath4 , with boundary @xmath5 , by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a time interval .",
    "the domain of the space surrounding the body is @xmath8 and is assumed to be vacuum .",
    "the corresponding velocity and acceleration are denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , while the deformation gradient is @xmath11 , and where due to the material impenetrability @xmath12 .",
    "vectors between two infinitesimally close points are related through @xmath13 , whereas area elements are transformed via nanson s formula @xmath14 .",
    "the volume ratio between an infinitesimal volume element @xmath15 in the deformed configuration , and its counterpart in the reference @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 .",
    "as measures of the deformation the right and left cauchy - green strain tensors @xmath18 and @xmath19 are used .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the electric field in the current configuration .",
    "commonly the electric field is given by means of a gradient of a scalar field , namely the electrostatic potential .",
    "the induced electric displacement field @xmath21 is related to the electric field in free space via the vacuum permittivity @xmath22 such that @xmath23 . in dielectric media",
    "an appropriate constitutive law specifies the relationship between these fields .",
    "generally , this connection can be non - linear and anisotropic .",
    "the balance of linear momentum is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total stress tensor , and @xmath26 is the material mass density .",
    "the balance of angular momentum implies that @xmath25 is symmetric .",

    "we postulate a separation of the traction into the sum of a mechanical traction @xmath30 which is a prescribed data , and an electrical traction @xmath31 which is induced by the external electric field .",
    "assuming no free body charge ( ideal dielectric ) , gauss law reads@xmath32 under a quasi - electrostatic approximation , appropriate when for the same frequency the length of the waves under consideration are shorter than the electromagnetic waves , faraday s law states that the electric field is curl - free , i.e. , @xmath33 thus enabling the usage of the aforementioned electrostatic potential .",
    "taking into account fields outside the material , which henceforth will be identified by a star superscript , the following jump conditions should be satisfied across @xmath5 , namely    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the surface charge density , and the notation @xmath36 is used for the difference between fields inside and outside of the material .",

    "specifically , we have that @xmath43 for the total first piola - kirchhoff stress , lagrangian electric displacement and electric field , respectively ( e.g. , ) . the corresponding balance equations are @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the density of the material in the reference configuration . the jump conditions across the boundary @xmath3 read @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a unit outward normal to @xmath3 .    following ,",

    "recent experiments reveal how pre - stretching of dielectric elastomers enhances properties such as the actuation strain ( ) and breakdown strength ( @xcite ) .",
    "a thorough investigation of the subject was recently done by @xcite .",
    "motivated by these findings , we address the response of pre - stretched dielectric elastomers to incremental deformations .    following the formulation given in @xcite",
    ", we consider infinitesimal time - dependent elastic displacement and electric displacement increments @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , superimposed on the foregoing static configuration @xmath4 reached via @xmath58 . herein and throughout this work",

    "we recall that the constitutive laws in terms of the aedf has the deformation gradient and the electric displacement field as its independent variables . whenever the material is isotropic its symmetry can be exploited , and the dependency of the aedf on @xmath51 and @xmath52 is reduced to the appropriate invariants of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , namely @xmath78 and@xmath79    thus , we consider the aedf @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the shear modulus and @xmath82 is the material permittivity that equals the vacuum permittivity @xmath22 times the material relative permittivity @xmath83 .",

    "the surface charge @xmath104 is evaluated via eq . , recalling that @xmath105 .      once again the surfaces @xmath99 are coated with electrodes and are free of mechanical traction .",
    "the layer is first pre - stretched along the @xmath92-axis to @xmath106 , and then clamped ( fig .",
    "[ all paths]b ) .",
    "subsequently , an electric displacement field is applied , while the longitudinal stretch is kept constant .",
    "the pressure is given in terms of the pre - stretch and the electric displacement field as @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",

    "the absence of the electrodes on the surfaces implies that @xmath110 , where the pressure and the stretch are determined via the corresponding jump conditions to yield@xmath111 we note that when deriving the solution it was assumed the electric field is homogeneous outside the layer , neglecting fringing effects .",
    "thus , this solution is by no means exact , and serves only as a qualitative result .",
    "( [ eq : lambda d third path]a ) reveals that the layer contracts along the @xmath92-axis and expands along the direction of the electric displacement , contrary to the situation in path a.",
    "we determine next the mechanical and electrical waves due to harmonic excitation along the @xmath92-axis superimposed on the deformed configurations described previously .",

    "it may be rewritten in the form @xmath121 the last two equations constitute a system of two coupled equations for the stream functions @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "a solution is feasible once the current stretch @xmath124 and the dimensionless nominal electric displacement @xmath125 are prescribed in addition to the density @xmath26 and shear modulus @xmath81 of the layer .",
    "we recall that while for the paths a and c the quantities @xmath125 and @xmath124 are uniquely related via eqs .",
    "( [ eq : l d p d]a ) and ( [ eq : lambda d third path]a ) , respectively , they are independent for path b. also note that the quantity @xmath126 can be integrated into the amplitude of the stream function @xmath123 .",
    "next we assume a solution with time - dependency in the form @xmath127 and a periodicity along the @xmath92-axis in the form @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the angular frequency and @xmath130 is the associated wavenumber , such that the wave velocity is @xmath131 .",
    "thus , traveling waves solutions in the form @xmath132 are sought , where the appropriate values of @xmath133 are to be found from the governing equations .",

    "the associated stream functions vanish as expected since an in - plane bulk shear wave can not propagate in this manner .",
    "usually , the general solutions for @xmath122 and @xmath123 are obtained as a linear combination of the roots in the form of @xmath143 however , a somewhat different structure of the solution is required for the dh model . for the general case when the constitutive law involves @xmath144 , a full coupling between the mechanical and electric equations is expected ( see @xcite ) , and hence dependency between @xmath145 and @xmath146 exists for all @xmath147 . however , for the specific constitutive behavior considered here we find that for the roots @xmath148 , @xmath149 , the coefficients associated with @xmath150 in the counter diagonal of the coefficients matrix vanishes .",

    "as the electrodes surface charge is fixed we have that @xmath176 , and the corresponding jump condition in eq .",
    "becomes @xmath177 where @xmath178 .",

    "along this path the maxwell stress and its increment do not vanish outside the layer , yielding the following form of eq .",
    "@xmath183 where @xmath184 the expressions for @xmath185 and @xmath186 are given in eqs .",
    "the external electric fields do not vanish in this path , and hence eq .",
    "assumes the form    @xmath187    where @xmath188 the remaining jump in eq .",

    "furthermore , they constitute a set of linear homogeneous equations in the unknowns , hence non - trivial solutions exist when the determinant of the coefficients matrix vanishes .",
    "this , in turn , is the extension of the well - known rayleigh - lamb transcendental equation for a purely elastic layer , and tiersten s result for a piezoelectric plate @xcite within the framework of infinitesimal deformations . of practical interest",
    "is the dependency of the dispersion relation , usually given in terms of the frequency spectrum , on the bias field and the finite deformation .",
    "these are discussed in the next section",
    "the working scheme of this section can be formulated as follows : _ given an angular frequency of excitation _",
    "@xmath129 , _ we determine the associated wavenumbers @xmath190 satisfying the generalized transcendental equation , determine the velocities of the propagating waves @xmath191 , and examine how these vary as functions of the bias field and pre - stretch .",
    "_ specifically , for paths a and c the dependency on the bias field is examined for a few representative values of @xmath192 . for path",
    "b , having the deformed configuration fixed we find it advantages to explore the dependency in terms of @xmath193 .",
    "recalling that along this path the pre - stretch and the electric displacement field are independent , the dependency of the dispersion relation on a few representative values of the pre - stretch @xmath194 is also examined .",
    "of special interest is the identification and evaluation of the fundamental modes , i.e. , those modes having finite velocity in the limit of long waves ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we find it useful to represent the results in terms of the dimensionless quantities @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the bulk shear wave velocity in an isotropic elastic material .",
    "further , our numerical investigation implies that the value of the parameter @xmath83 has only minor a influence on the frequency spectrum due to the choices @xmath103 and @xmath199 which are normalized by the material permittivity .",
    "accordingly , as a representative value we chose @xmath200 .    in their fundamental works lord @xcite and @xcite had shown that in the purely elastic case a decomposition of the mechanical vibrations can be made into symmetric ( extensional ) and antisymmetric ( flexural ) modes with respect to the mid - plane of the layer .",
    "interestingly , a similar decomposition of the mechanical displacement is possible for the coupled problem .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the symmetry of the electrical displacements is reversed in the sense that whenever the mechanical displacements are symmetric , the electrical displacements are antisymmetric , and vice versa . to distinguish between the two types of modes we employ the following procedure . for the antisymmetric modes we subtract eq",

    "further , the fundamental symmetric mode attains the well known result @xmath212 in the limit of long waves , or , equivalently , thin layers ( small @xmath206 ) .    as @xmath192 increases a monotonous rise of the velocity in the limit of long waves for the symmetric mode",

    "this is attained when a threshold value @xmath224 is applied , such that @xmath225 thus @xmath224 can be perceived as the value of @xmath193 at which a half - space losses its stability .",

    "the slope of the curves is changing from positive to negative and to positive once again .",
    "this corresponds to a situation where for the same frequency there are more than one wavenumber satisfying the dispersion relation for the fundamental symmetric mode , and subsequently the pertained different wavelengths propagate with different velocities .",
    "if the frequency is to be taken as the independent variable , this suggests a peculiar phenomenon in which as the frequency is increased there is a possibility for the appearance of shorter and slower waves that propagate along with the `` primary '' waves .",
    "we recall that eq .",

    "three different loading paths which result in the aforementioned finite configurations were addressed . in path",
    "a the layer is free to expand along its longitudinal direction and deformed due to the electric excitation along its thickness . in path b the layer is initially pre - stretched , then clamped , and subsequently the electric field is employed . in path",
    "c the layer is immersed in a pre - existing electric field .",
    "following @xcite small perturbations on top of the homogeneous finite deformation are considered .",
    "the coupled equations of incremental electrodynamics along with the pertained boundary conditions yielded the desired dispersion relation . for the dh model this required a non - conventional presentation of the solution of the governing equations .",

    "a the velocity of both short waves ( half - space , large @xmath206 ) and long waves ( thin plate , small @xmath206 ) is increased when the electric displacement field is enhanced . while in the limit of long waves a similar rise in the velocity is observed in path b , the velocity decreases as function of the electric displacement field in the limit of short waves . the existence of a threshold values of @xmath193 at which the layer losses stability is observed .",
    "the pre - stretch effect is shown to be stabilizing , as higher values of @xmath193 are needed to reach the onset of instability .",
    "dispersion relations similar to the ones obtained in path b were observed in path c. we finally stress that along all paths there is a marked influence of the bias electric field and pre - stretch on the propagation speed .",
