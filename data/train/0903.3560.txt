    "the discovery of the fe - pnictide superconductors @xcite offers a new opportunity to investigate superconductivity and its mechanism in a new class of materials .",
    "the pnictide superconductors share some features of the high-@xmath7 cuprate superconductors : the superconductivity occurs in the proximity of an antiferromagnetic compound and can be induced by doping . however , there are also significant differences , for example , the parent antiferromagnets are metallic@xcite",
    ". the two most widely studied systems are those based on rfeaso@xmath8f@xmath9 ( with r = nd , sm , pr , la ) @xcite and afe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( a = ca , sr , ba ) @xcite , known as `` 1111 '' and `` 122 '' respectively .",
    "the 122 system can be doped at the a @xcite or fe @xcite sites to achieve superconductivity .",
    "the determination of the phase diagram as a function of doping in the fe - pnictide systems is an important step to understanding the superconductivity . however , there appears to be significant differences between the various systems .",
    "the general tendency is for doping to suppress orthorhombic structure and antiferromagnetic order @xcite present at low temperatures and for superconductivity to emerge .",
    "however , the manner in which this transition occurs appears to vary between systems . in cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath8 , the magnetic order",
    "is suppressed before superconductivity develops and superconductivity exists both in the orthorhombic and tetragonal structures @xcite .",
    "whereas in lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath8 , the orthorhombicity and magnetic order disappear abruptly @xcite just as the superconductivity develops . in this paper , we use neutron scattering to investigate the magnetic and structural phase diagram of the electron doped superconductor ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this material has risen to prominence recently because high - quality single crystals can be prepared which show two anomalies in the heat capacity @xmath10 and resistivity @xmath11 for small co doping @xcite . here we use neutron and x - ray scattering to identify the nature of the transitions and determine the phase diagram .",
    "in contrast to observations in lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath8 and cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath8 , we find that the orthorhombic transition and magnetic order persist to higher dopings and coexist with the superconductivity .",
    "single crystals of ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 with @xmath3=0.025 , 0.045 and 0.051 were grown by a self flux method @xcite .",
