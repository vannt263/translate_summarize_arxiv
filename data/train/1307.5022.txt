    "by now the present acceleration of the universe is quite well established observationally @xcite , and the cause for it is attributed to a mysterious component called dark energy whose true nature is still unknown to us .",
    "a cosmological constant serves as the simplest possible explanation for the current acceleration but it is endowed with several conceptual problems @xcite .",
    "there is no dearth of innovative ideas to explain the current acceleration @xcite but our present state of knowledge offers no clear indication on the nature of the big rip that our universe seems to be headed for .    we know from observations that the universe is inhomogeneous up to the scales of super - clusters of galaxies , which suggests that some modification is needed for our standard cosmological framework that is based on the globally smooth friedmannrobertsonwalker ( frw ) metric .",
    "since the equations of general relativity are non - linear in nature therefore if we take the global average of the einstein tensor then those results are very unlikely to be the same as that obtained by taking the average over all the different local metrics and then computing the global einstein tensor .",
    "this realization has lead to the investigation of the question of how backreaction originating from density inhomogeneities could modify the evolution of the universe as described by the background frw metric at large scales .",
    "several approaches have been developed to facilitate the study of the effects of inhomogeneous matter distribution on the evolution of the universe , such as zalaletdinov s fully covariant macroscopic gravity @xcite ; buchert s approach of averaging the scalar parts of einstein s equations @xcite , the perturbation techniques proposed by kolb et .",
    "@xcite , and recently another procedure based on light - cone averaging has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued , by using the framework developed by buchert , that backreaction from inhomogeneities could be responsible for the current acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "a different perspective of the buchert framework developed by wiltshire @xcite also leads to an apparent acceleration due to the different lapse of time in underdense and overdense regions .",
    "since inhomogeneities lead to the formation of structures in the present era therefore the effects of backreaction will also gain strength in the present era , and hence if backreaction is indeed responsible for the current accelerated expansion then it will provide an interesting platform to study this issue , without invoking additional physics . while there is some debate on the impact of inhomogeneities on observables of an overall homogeneous frw model @xcite , and there are also similar questions with regard to the magnitude of backreaction modulated by the effect of shear between overdense and underdense regions @xcite , recent studies @xcite have provided a strong motivation for exploring further the role of inhomogeneities on the evolution of the present universe .",
    "nonetheless further investigations with the input of data from future observational probes are required for a conclusive picture to emerge .",
    "recently we studied the backreaction scenario within the buchert framework using a simple two - scale model @xcite .",
    "our model indicated the possibility of a transition to a future decelerated era .",
    "the buchert framework has been further extended in   so as to facilitate the study of backreaction in the case where the universe is considered to be divided into multiple domains and subdomains .",
    "but the model that was considered in   was a simple model consisting of one overdense subdomain and one underdense subdomain , like that used in  .",
    "such a simple model is attractive because it simplifies the evolution equations and eases the process of understanding the effect of backreaction on the evolution of the universe .",
    "but the real universe can not be partitioned simply into one overdense subdomain and one underdense subdomain . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "so far there has been no study on the effect of backreaction from inhomogeneities by considering multiple subdomains .",
    "using the formalism proposed in  , in the present paper we improve upon our previous two - scale model and consider the universe as a global domain @xmath0 which is partitioned into multiple overdense and underdense regions , and all these subdomains are taken to evolve differently to each other .",
    "this is done in order to recreate the real universe as much as possible in our simple model .",
    "our aim here is to study the future evolution of the universe by taking into consideration its current accelerated expansion .",
    "the accelerated expansion of the universe can be assumed to be caused by backreaction or any other mechanism @xcite .",
    "we consider two different partitioning cases of the universe and explore the future evolution of the universe for these two cases and then perform a comparative analysis for the two .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly recapitulate the essential details of the buchert framework @xcite including the evolution equations when the universe is partitioned into multiple subdomains .",
    "next , in section iii we follow the approach of   and investigate the future evolution of the universe assuming its present stage of global acceleration . subsequently , in section iv we perform a quantitative comparison of various dynamical features of our model for the two partitioning cases that we consider .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and make some concluding remarks in section v.",
    "in the framework developed by buchert @xcite for the universe filled with an irrotational fluid of dust , the spacetime is foliated into flow - orthogonal hypersurfaces featuring the line - element @xmath1 where the proper time @xmath2 labels the hypersurfaces and @xmath3 are gaussian normal coordinates ( locating free - falling fluid elements or generalized fundamental observers ) in the hypersurfaces , and @xmath4 is the full inhomogeneous three metric of the hypersurfaces of constant proper time . the framework is applicable to perfect fluid matter models .    for a compact spatial domain @xmath0 ,",
    "comoving with the fluid , there is one fundamental quantity characterizing it and that is its volume .",
    "this volume is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 . from the domain s volume",
    "one may define a scale - factor @xmath7 that encodes the average stretch of all directions of the domain .    using the einstein equations , with a pressure - less fluid source",
    ", we get the following equations @xcite @xmath8 here the average of the scalar quantities on the domain @xmath0 is defined as , @xmath9 and where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the local matter density , the ricci - scalar of the three - metric @xmath13 , and the domain dependent hubble rate @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the kinematical backreaction @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the local expansion rate and @xmath18 is the squared rate of shear .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath12 is defined as @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath15 encodes the departure from homogeneity and for a homogeneous domain its value is zero .",
    "one also has an integrability condition that is necessary to yield from and that relation reads as @xmath20 from this equation we see that the evolution of the backreaction term , and hence extrinsic curvature inhomogeneities , is coupled to the average intrinsic curvature . unlike the frw evolution equations where the curvature term is restricted to an @xmath21 behaviour , here it is more dynamical because it can be any function of @xmath22 .",
    "the `` global '' domain @xmath0 is assumed to be separated into subregions @xmath23 , which themselves consist of elementary space entities @xmath24 that may be associated with some averaging length scale . in mathematical terms",
    "@xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 for all @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the average of the scalar valued function @xmath30 on the domain @xmath0 may then be split into the averages of @xmath30 on the subregions @xmath23 in the form , @xmath31 where @xmath32 , is the volume fraction of the subregion @xmath23 .",
    "the above equation directly provides the expression for the separation of the scalar quantities @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath19 .",
    "however , @xmath15 , as defined in , does not split in such a simple manner due to the @xmath33 term . instead the correct formula turns out to be @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are defined in @xmath23 in the same way as @xmath37 and @xmath12 are defined in @xmath0 .",
    "the shear part @xmath38 is completely absorbed in @xmath35 , whereas the variance of the local expansion rates @xmath39 is partly contained in @xmath35 but also generates the extra term @xmath40 .",
    "this is because the part of the variance that is present in @xmath35 , namely @xmath41 only takes into account points inside @xmath23 . to restore the variance that comes from combining points of @xmath23 with others in @xmath42 , the extra term containing the averaged hubble rate emerges .",
    "note here that the above formulation of the backreaction holds in the case when there is no interaction between the overdense and the underdense subregions .",
    "analogous to the scale - factor for the global domain , a scale - factor @xmath43 for each of the subregions @xmath23 can be defined such that @xmath44 , and hence , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the initial volume fraction of the subregion @xmath23 .",
    "if we now twice differentiate this equation with respect to the foliation time and use the result for @xmath47 from , we then get the expression that relates the acceleration of the global domain to that of the sub - domains : @xmath48",
    "we will now explore the future evolution of the universe after the current stage of acceleration sets in .",
    "it is not necessary to assume that the acceleration is caused by backreaction @xcite . for the purpose of our present analysis",
    ", it suffices to consider the observed accelerated phase of the universe @xcite that could occur due to any of a variety of mechanisms @xcite .    following the buchert framework @xcite as discussed above , the global domain @xmath0",
    "is divided into multiple domains .",
    "we consider @xmath0 to be partitioned into equal numbers of overdense and underdense domains .",
    "we label all overdense domains as @xmath49 ( called ` wall ' ) and all underdense domains as @xmath50 ( called ` void ' ) , such that @xmath51 . in this case one",
    "obtains @xmath52 , with similar expressions for @xmath53 and @xmath54 and also @xmath55 .",
    "for such a partitioning the global acceleration can be written as    @xmath56    we assume that the scale - factors of the regions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are , respectively , given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constants .",

    "note here that using our ansatz for the subdomain scale factors one may try to determine the global scale factor through eq .. in order to do so , one needs to know the inital volume fractions @xmath80 which are in turn related to the @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",

    "let us now compare the nature of acceleration of the universe for the two cases described in the previous section .",
    "the global acceleration for the two cases have been plotted in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "in both the figures curves ( i ) and ( iii ) are for the case where @xmath0 is partitioned into 50 overdense and underdense subdomains each , and curves ( ii ) and ( iv ) correspond to the case where @xmath0 is partitioned into 100 overdense and underdense subdomains each . the values for the expansion parameters @xmath62 of the overdense subdomains",
    "is taken to lie between @xmath90 and @xmath91 since the expansion is assumed to be faster than in the radiation dominated case , and is upper limited by the value for matter dominated expansion . in fig .",
    "1 the behaviour of global acceleration is shown for values of @xmath92 and also @xmath93 , keeping the range of values of @xmath62 quite narrow and also the same for all four curves .",
    "we have kept the value of @xmath61 close to @xmath94 when @xmath92 because if @xmath61 is less than a certain value , which depends on the value of @xmath62 , then the acceleration becomes undefined as we do not get real solutions from . in order to demonstrate this fact analytically",
    "let us consider a toy model where @xmath0 is divided into one overdense subdomain @xmath49 and one underdense subdomain @xmath50 . in this case can be written as    @xmath95    now we must have @xmath96 , so we can write @xmath97 .",
    "therefore the above equation now becomes    @xmath98    from this equation we see that the global acceleration vanishes at times given by    @xmath99\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this shows us that we get real time solutions for @xmath100 $ ] . if we now consider @xmath101 ( its lowest possible value ) then we get @xmath102 and if we consider @xmath103 ( its highest possible value ) then we get @xmath104 .",
    "hence as stated earlier , for a particular value of @xmath73 we have a lower limit on the value of @xmath72 .    in fig .",
    "1 , for @xmath92 the acceleration becomes negative in the future for both cases of partitioning ( curves ( i ) and ( ii ) ) .",
    "the acceleration reaches a greater value and at a slightly later time when @xmath0 is partitioned into 100 overdense and underdense subdomains ( curve ( ii ) ) and also becomes negative at an earlier time as compared to the case where @xmath0 is partitioned into 50 overdense and underdense subdomains ( curve ( i ) ) .",
    "when @xmath93 then we see that the acceleration curves for the two cases are almost identical , with the maximum value being very slightly larger for partition type ( i ) ( curve ( iii ) ) . after reaching the maximum the acceleration decreases and goes asymptotically to a small positive value . when @xmath92",
    "then the first two terms of are negative , but the last term , which is always positive , gains prominence as the number of subdomains increases thus increasing the acceleration .",
    "when @xmath93 then only the first term in is negative and hence the acceleration curves for the two partition cases ( curves ( iii ) and ( iv ) ) are very similar , the only visible difference being the slightly higher maximum value when @xmath0 is partitioned into a lower number of subdomains .    in fig .",
    "2 we have illustrated the behaviour of the global acceleration by taking narrow and broad ranges of values of @xmath62 and keeping @xmath92 and the same for all the curves . as seen in fig . 1 here also the acceleration becomes negative in the future for all the curves because we have @xmath92 for all of them , but we see that the difference between the acceleration curves for the two partition cases is very small when we consider a narrow range of values of @xmath62 ( cuves ( i ) and ( ii ) ) and the difference increases considerably when we consider a broad range of values of @xmath62 ( curve ( iii ) and ( iv ) ) .",
    "the acceleration attains a much greater value when @xmath0 is partitioned into a larger number of subdomains and also becomes negative quicker .",
    "the reason for the latter behaviour is that the broad range of values of @xmath62 makes the third term in gain more prominence when we consider a larger number of subdomains thus resulting in greater positive acceleration .",
    "a similar comparison of the backreaction for the two models is presented in figs . 3 and 4 where we have plotted the backreaction density for the duration over which the global acceleration is positive .",
    "we see in these figures that the backreaction density is negative and from the expression of @xmath105 and it can be seen that the backreaction will be dominated by the variance of the local expansion rate @xmath17 . in fig .",
    "3 we see that for @xmath92 , the backreaction density reaches a minimum , which is also greater in magnitude , for partition type ( ii ) ( curve ( ii ) ) as compared to partition type ( i ) ( curve ( i ) ) . for @xmath93",
    "the curves for the two cases are almost identical , the only difference being that for partition type ( i ) ( curve ( iii ) ) the backreaction density reaches a minimum of greater magnitude . in fig .",
    "4 we see that , just like the acceleration curves , the difference between the backreaction plots for the two partition cases is much smaller when we consider a narrow range of values of @xmath62 , but the difference beomes quite large when we consider a broad range of values of @xmath62 . the behaviour of the backreaction as illustrated in figs .",
    "3 and 4 is quite similar to the global acceleration , as seen in figs .",
    "1 and 2 , and that is expected because from we see that @xmath37 is linearly proportional to the global acceleration .     vs. @xmath70 for various numbers of subdomains .",
    "in all the curves we have @xmath61 in the range 0.990 - 0.999 , and @xmath62 in the range 0.58 - 0.60 . for curve ( i )",
    "we consider 100 overdense and underdense subdomains , in ( ii ) 400 overdense and underdense subdomains and in ( iii ) 500 overdense and underdense subdomains each.,width=313 ]    in order to see how the global acceleration behaves based on the number of subdomains we have in fig .",
    "5 plotted the global acceleration vs. time for three partition cases where we consider ( i ) 100 overdense and underdense subdomains , ( ii ) 400 overdense and underdense subdomains and ( iii ) 500 overdense and underdense subdomains each .",
    "for all three cases we have kept the range of values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 the same and taken @xmath92 .",
    "it is clearly seen from the plot that the global acceleration increases in magnitude as the number of subdomains increases , and the maximum is obtained later in time with increase in the number of subdomains .",
    "we also see that the acceleration becomes negative faster when the number of subdomains increases .",
    "to summarize , in this work we have performed a detailed analysis of the various aspects of the future evolution of the presently accelerating universe in the presence of matter inhomogeneities .",
    "the effect of backreaction from inhomogeneities on the global evolution is calculated within the context of the buchert framework by considering the universe to be divided into multiple underdense and overdense domains , each evolving independently , in order to recreate the real universe more accurately @xcite .",
    "we analyze the future evolution of the universe using the buchert framework by computing the global acceleration and strength of backreaction .",
    "we show that the buchert framework allows for the possibility of the global acceleration vanishing at a finite future time , provided that none of the subdomains accelerate individually ( both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are less than @xmath94 ) .",
    "our analysis shows that if the @xmath62 parameters as distributed over a narrow range of values and @xmath92 then the global acceleration reaches a greater maximum , when the number of subdomains is larger , showing that the last term in , which is always positive , has more prominence for a large number of subdomains .",
    "this difference between the accelerations for the two partition cases decreases even more when @xmath93 , because then only the first term in has a negative contribution .",
    "however when we consider a broad range of values of @xmath62 then the difference between the accelerations for the two cases becomes much larger , the acceleration being greater for a larger number of subdomains .",
    "the cause for this is attributed to the dominance of the third term in when we have a larger number of subdomains and a broad range of values of @xmath62 .",
    "we also saw that the behaviour of the backreaction mimics the behaviour of the global acceleration , and that is expected because as seen from , we have @xmath37 linearly proportional to the acceleration .",
    "our results indicate that backreaction can not only be responsible for the current accelerated expansion , as shown in earlier works @xcite , but can also cause the acceleration to slow down and even lead to a future decelerated era in some cases . in drawing this conclusion",
    "it was not necessary for us to assume that the current acceleration is caused by backreaction , and the acceleration could have been caused by any other mechanism @xcite .",
