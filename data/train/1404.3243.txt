    "libraries of stellar spectra are important in a variety of areas : _ ( a ) _ deriving atmospheric parameters in stellar surveys , via automatic analysis and classification of data ; _ ( b ) _ determination of radial velocities via cross - correlation against templates , e.g. , for the detection of exoplanets ; _ ( c ) _ calibration of features for spectroscopic classification ; _ ( d ) _ calibration of photometric indices , and ; _ ( e ) _ in the study of the star formation history of galaxies as a core ingredient to stellar population models .",
    "a stellar library is at the heart of accurate stellar population models , and should ideally provide complete coverage of the hr diagram , accurate atmospheric parameters ( effective temperature , surface gravities and abundances [ fe / h ] , [ mg / fe ] , etc . ) , good compromise between wavelength coverage , spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ( s / n ) .",
    "both empirical and theoretical libraries can be used for this purpose , and which choice is `` best '' is a matter of on - going debate at related conferences and literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the main caveat of empirical libraries is the limited coverage of the hr diagram : hot stars are not well sampled and abundance patterns are biased towards the solar neighbourhood . with the advent of modern extragalactic surveys , this limitation hampered our ability of studying stellar populations which have undergone a star formation history very different from the one in our vicinity .",
    "the first compelling evidence of this limitation was presented by @xcite , who showed that stellar population models for lick / ids indices can not reproduce the indices measured in elliptical galaxies , indicating that these systems are overabundant in @xmath1-elements relative to the sun .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that , by construction , the abundance pattern of stellar population models based on empirical libraries is dictated by that of the library stars , which is dominated by the abundance pattern of the solar neighbourhood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical libraries can be used to overcome this limitation and several are available in literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* sampling only the last decade ) .",
    "moreover , a theoretical stellar spectrum has very well defined atmospheric parameters , does not suffer from low s / n , and covers a larger wavelength range at a higher spectral resolution than any observed spectrum .    on the other hand ,",
    "being based on our knowledge of the physics of stellar atmospheres and databases of atomic and molecular opacities , theoretical libraries are limited by the approximations and ( in)accuracies of their underlying models and input data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "besides , a theoretical spectral library that is intended to reproduce high resolution spectra is not a library that also predicts good spectrophotometry .",
    "that happens because when computing a synthetic spectrum , one has to choose to include or not the so - called ` predicted lines ' : lines where either one or both energy levels of the transition were predicted from quantum mechanics calculations @xcite , as opposed to lines whose energy levels were measured in laboratory .",
    "usually only the lower energy levels of atoms have been determined in the laboratory , particularly for complex atoms such as iron .",
    "if only those transitions were taken into account , the atmospheric line blanketing computed from such data would be severely incomplete .",
    "the predicted lines are essential for computing accurately the structure of model atmospheres and for spectrophotometric predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "but as the quantum mechanics predictions are accurate to only a few per cent , wavelengths for these lines may be largely uncertain , and the line oscillator strengths are sufficiently accurate merely in a statistical sense @xcite .",
    "the predicted lines are , therefore , unsuitable for high resolution analyses @xcite . in practice ,",
    "theoretical libraries aimed at spectrophotometric calibrations include the predicted lines , while libraries aimed at high resolution studies are computed with shorter , fine - tuned , often empirically calibrated atomic and molecular line lists ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with current atomic data available ,",
    "either choice is only a compromise solution .",
    "despite these limitations , model stellar spectra opened new important ways to study integrated light from stellar populations .",
    "theoretical stellar libraries have been used to build fully theoretical stellar population models @xcite , and were crucial for the development of methods which lead to the measuring of element abundances ( beyond the global metal content ) in integrated stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in recent years , model spectra are flourishing in extragalactic applications by allowing the spectral modelling of a variety of stellar histories via differential methods , i.e. , combining empirical stellar libraries with model predictions @xcite .",
    "this work is the first of a series aiming at expanding our stellar population modelling @xcite towards larger coverage in ages , metallicities and wavelength range .",
    "a library of theoretical stellar spectra is presented , bringing : _ ( a ) _ a homogeneous computation of opacity distribution functions , model atmospheres , statistical samples of surface fluxes from 130 nm to 100@xmath2 m for low resolution studies , and high resolution synthetic spectra computed from 250 to 900 nm ; _ ( b ) _ high resolution spectra with continuum slopes corrected for the effect of predicted lines , and ; _ ( c ) _ two families of @xmath1-enhanced mixtures for each scaled - solar iron abundance , to allow differential studies of the @xmath1-enhancement both at ` fixed iron ' and ` fixed z ' cases .",
    "the present library is not intended as a direct replacement for the one presented in @xcite as the later was tailored at the modelling of stars of spectral types g , k and early - m .",
    "the present library employed different codes and opacities and covers a larger range of effective temperatures , being favoured in differential spectral analysis .",
    "stellar population models built with the present library will be published in a forthcoming paper ( coelho et al .",
    "2014 , in prep ) .",
    "section [ s : lib ] describes how the models were computed and the ingredients adopted .",
    "the effect of the predicted lines is discussed and quantified in  [ s : pl ] . section  [ s : comparisons ] compares the model predictions with observations : a comparison with an empirical colour - temperature calibration is given in ",
    "[ s : colours ] ; and in ",
    "[ s : spectra ] ,  [ s : atmpars ] the model spectra are compared to an empirical spectral library .",
    "concluding remarks are given in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the library consists of opacity distribution functions , model atmospheres , statistical samples of surface fluxes ( models ) and high resolution synthetic spectra ( models ) .",
    "each of these components of the library is explained in detail below and the whole library is publicly available to the astronomical community .",
    "the and models can be retrieved from the spanish virtual observatory ( svo ; @xcite ) and from the website of the authorpcoelho/ ] , as fits files @xcite .",
    "the files can be queried via web interface at the svo theoretical data server or via any software that is compliant to the vo tsap protocol .",
    "the odf and model atmosphere files can be obtained upon request to the author .    the target use of the present library , although not limited to that , is the spectral modelling of stellar populations and the measurement of ages , iron abundances and @xmath1 over iron ratios in integrated light @xcite . as such , the coverage of the parameters and were fine - tuned to encompass evolutionary stages relevant to the integrated light of populations with ages between 30myr and 14gyr , from lower main sequence to the early asymptotic giant branch .",
    "the library encompasses 12 different chemical mixtures , summarised in table [ tab_mixes ] .",
    "these mixtures were chosen to be consistent with a new grid of stellar evolutionary tracks to be presented in a forthcoming paper on stellar population models ( coelho et al .",

    "the origin of this pattern is , at the moment , unknown . in advance to compute future model libraries , it could be interesting to investigate in more detail the stars in these regions and identify if the mismatches are related to a characteristic flaw in the models or in the atmospheric parameters adopted for the empirical spectra . also ,",
    "larger deviations than average are found for some stars hotter than 12500k where , as noted previously , the sampling of stars in miles is low .",

    "[ fig : resmapfeh ] shows the contour regions of @xmath6()@xmath7 in the @xmath8 ( ) vs. [ fe / h ] space .",
    "the most deviant region correspond to the coolest regime , which were already shown to be the most deviating model spectra ( table [ t : milespar ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_miles ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "model spectra were compared to empirical spectra in two ways : by the statistical comparison of the fluxes and by comparing their atmospheric parameters scales .",
    "regarding the first comparison , it was shown that at medium spectral resolution used nowadays at stellar population studies , the model spectra reproduce the observations for a large range of temperatures and wavelength intervals ( typically within 3% in flux above = 6000k , raising to 10% at = 4000k ) .",
    "there are few wavelength regions which deviate and should be further investigated .",
    "regarding the second comparison , on average the parameter scales of the model and empirical library agree within the uncertainties . among the few deviant cases , at least some of them can be related to the sparsity of the empirical library coverage .",
    "a library of theoretical stellar spectra is presented .",
    "this library consists of newly computed odfs , atlas9 model atmospheres , low resolution fluxes from uv to far  ir ( ) and high resolution spectra from 2500 to 9000 ( ) .",
    "the library comprises 12 chemical abundance mixtures , four of those being scaled - solar and the remaining being enhanced in @xmath1-elements by 0.4dex .",
    "the intended main use of this library is as an ingredient to fully theoretical and differential stellar population models , therefore the coverage in the vs. parameters space was fine - tuned to the requirements of stellar evolutionary tracks of populations between 30myr and 14gyr , z between 0.0017 and 0.049 at both scaled - solar and @xmath1-enhanced mixtures .    through the comparison between and models ,",
    "a study on the spectrophotometric effect of lines with predicted energy levels was performed .",
    "it is demonstrated that these lines affect the spectrophotometric predictions for stars below @xmath9 7000k only .",
    "ad - hoc correction functions were derived on a star - by - star basis to bring the spectrophotometric predictions of the models ( which do not include lines with predicted energy levels ) into better agreement with those of the models ( which includes them ) .",
    "broad band colours predictions from the models were compared to a recent empirical -colour calibration from literature @xcite .",
    "averaged colour differences were derived to be : @xmath5(u  b ) = 0.168 , @xmath5(b  v ) = -0.032 , @xmath5(v ",
    "i ) = -0.011 , @xmath5(v ",
    "r ) = -0.031 , @xmath5(j  k ) = -0.018 and @xmath5(h  k ) = -0.015 .",
    "the models were compared to the empirical library miles @xcite in two ways : by the comparison of fluxes and by the comparison of their atmospheric parameters scales .",
    "for the first test , statistically meaningful comparisons were attempted , though relatively few nodes in , of the theoretical library have a counterpart in miles with a large number of stars . for the solar metalicity , where miles coverage is best",
    ", only 11 pairs [ , ] were found with at least eight empirical spectra . a larger number of empirical stars per parameter interval would be desirable , in order to clearly identify where atomic and molecular line lists are systematically deviating from observations . within the sample studied in this work",
    ", there is evidence for : missing opacity below 4200 and excessive opacity in regions dominated by ch a  x , c@xmath12 and mgh . in the latter case",
    ", it would be interesting to further investigate if the effects at ch a  x and c@xmath12 bands could be related to non - solar abundances of c and n. it is also worth remembering that the core of very strong lines , such as h lines in stars hotter than = 6500k can not be well reproduced with lte spectral synthesis and photosphere models alone , and should therefore , be masked in automatic spectral fitting techniques involving model spectrum .",
    "as a second test of the models , atmospheric parameters of the model spectra were compared to parameters derived by a spectral interpolator based on miles stars @xcite .",
    "no significant systematic difference between model and empirical scales are found , with average differences comfortably below the uncertainties .",
    "some deviant regions are found , and some of those are related to regions of the vs. plane which are poorly populated in the empirical library .",
    "this result is particularly reassuring for methods which employ model libraries to automatically derive atmospheric parameters of stars in spectroscopic surveys .",
    "these comparisons also highlighted the advantage of model libraries in terms of covering the hr diagram , even when compared to the relatively recent and widely used empirical library miles .",
