    "a foundation for the understanding of critical phenomena was provided by wilson s renormalization group ( rg ) approach  @xcite which maps the critical point onto a fixed point of a certain transformation of the system s hamiltonian , langevin equation , etc .",
    "the rg theory presents a powerful tool to estimate the values of the critical exponents , it allows to predict which parameters determine the universality class and it explains the existence of an upper critical dimension  @xmath0 above which the mean - field theory applies .",
    "furthermore , crossover phenomena between two different universality classes are well understood in terms of competing fixpoints  ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless there are still some open aspects of crossover phenomena which are discussed in the literature .",
    "the question whether the crossover scaling functions are universal was revisited several times  @xcite .",
    "for instance it was shown recentlty that two different models , belonging to the same universality class , are characterized by the same ( universal ) crossover scaling functions  @xcite .",
    "this is remarkable , since the universal scaling behavior is usually restricted to a small vicinity around the critical point . in the case of a crossover",
    "the universal scaling functions span several decades in temperature or conjugated field .",
    "another question of interest concerns the so - called effective exponents  @xcite which can be defined as logarithmic derivatives of the corresponding scaling functions .",
    "it is still open whether these effective exponents fulfill over the full crossover the well - known scaling laws which connect critical exponents .",
    "this question is closely related to the more general and very important question whether effective exponents obey the scaling laws at all .",
    "for instance it is known experimentally  @xcite as well as theoretically  @xcite that the asymptotic scaling behavior is often masked by corrections to scaling , so - called confluent singularities . in this case",
    "it is useful to analyze the data in terms of effective exponents and the above question naturally arises  @xcite .",
    "thus the validity of the scaling laws for effective exponents was addressed in experimental works , rg approaches as well as numerical simulations .",
    "in particular the violation of the scaling laws for effective exponents was conjectured from a rg approximation  @xcite .",
    "but neither experimental nor numerical work could clearly confirm this conjecture so far .",
    "for instance binder and luijten considered numerically a crossover in the ising model and discussed the validity of the rushbrook scaling law  @xcite .",
    "the observed nonmonotonic crossover behavior suggests again a violation of the rushbrook scaling law .",
    "however it can not be considered as a rigorous proof .    in this work",
    "we consider a field driven crossover ( in the so - called critical crossover limit  @xcite ) in two different models exhibiting a non - equilibrium second order phase transition .",
    "varying the range of interactions we investigate the crossover from mean - field to non - mean - field scaling behavior .",
    "the order parameter and the order parameter susceptibility is measured as a function of the conjugated field and we are able to determine the corresponding effective exponents over the full crossover regime .",
    "our results show that the well - known widom scaling law is clearly violated for the effective crossover exponents .",
    "furthermore we present a simple analytical argument , suggesting that the scaling laws are valid for the asymptotic scaling regimes ( where the systems are characterized by a pure algebraic behavior ) , whereas the scaling laws do not hold for the crossover regime ( characterized by a non algebraic behavior ) .",
    "in the following we consider two different cellular automata exhibiting a so - called absorbing phase transition . the first model is the conserved transfer threshold process ( cttp )  @xcite . in this model lattice sites",
    "may be empty , occupied by one particle , or occupied by two particles .",
    "empty and single occupied sites are considered as inactive whereas double occupied lattice sites are considered as active . in the latter case one tries to transfer both particles of a given active site to randomly chosen empty or single occupied nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the second model is a modified version of the manna sandpile model  @xcite , the fixed - energy manna model  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the cttp the manna model allows unlimited particle occupation of lattice sites .",
    "lattice sites which are occupied by at least two particles are considered as active and all particles are moved to the neighboring sites selected at random .    in our simulations",
    "( see  @xcite for details ) we have used square lattices ( with periodic boundaries ) of linear size @xmath1 .",
    "all simulations start from a random distribution of particles . after a transient regime",
    "both models reach a steady state characterized by the density of active sites  @xmath2 .",
    "the density  @xmath2 is the order parameter and the particle density  @xmath3 is the control parameter of the absorbing phase transition , i.e. , the order parameter vanishes at the critical density  @xmath4 according to , @xmath5 , with the reduced control parameter @xmath6 . below the critical density ( in the absorbing phase )",
    "the order parameter is zero in the steady state .",
    "similar to equilibrium phase transitions it is possible in the case of absorbing phase transitions to apply an external field  @xmath7 which is conjugated to the order parameter .",
    "the conjugated field has to act as a spontaneous creation of active particles , destroying the absorbing state and therefore the phase transition itself .",
    "furthermore , the associated linear response function @xmath8 has to diverge at the critical point ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "a realization of the external field for absorbing phase transitions with a conserved field was recently developed in  @xcite where the external field triggers movements of inactive particles which may be activated in this way . at the critical density",
    "@xmath11 the order parameter scales as @xmath12 . using the conjugated field it is possible to investigate the equation of state  @xmath13 , i.e. , the order parameter as a function of both the control parameter and the external field .",
    "a recently performed scaling analysis reveals that the cttp and the manna model are characterized by the same critical exponents as well as by the same universal scaling form of the equation of state , i.e. , both models belong to the same universality class  @xcite .    according to the above definition particles of active sites",
    "are moved to nearest neighbors only , i.e. , the range of interactions is @xmath14 .",
    "it is straightforward to implement various ranges of interactions into these models  @xcite . in this",
    "modified models particles of active sites are moved ( according to the rules of each model ) to randomly selected sites within a radius  @xmath15 . since the dynamics of both considered models",
    "is characterized by simple particle hopping processes , various interaction ranges can be easily implemented and high accurate data are available . this is a significant advantage compared to e.g.  equilibrium system like the ising model where the increasing interaction range causes a slowing down of the dynamics .    for any finite interaction",
    "range the phase transition is characterized by non - mean - field scaling behavior which now takes place at the critical density  @xmath16 .",
    "a mean - field phase transition occur for infinite interactions ( @xmath17 ) only . but mean - field behavior could occur away from the critical point if the long range interactions reduce the critical fluctuations sufficiently .",
    "the crossover between the mean - field and non - mean - field scaling regimes is described by the famous ginzburg criterion  @xcite which states that the mean - field picture is self - consistent in the active phase as long as the fluctuations within a correlation volume are small compared to the order parameter itself .",
    "this leads for zero field to the crossover condition @xmath18 = 1 $ ] , with the crossover exponent @xmath19  @xcite . in order to avoid lattice effects we use the effective range of interactions  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the number of lattice sites within a radius  @xmath15",
    "the crossover scaling function has to incorporate three scaling fields ( the control parameter , the external field , and the range of interactions ) , i.e. , we make the phenomenological ansatz @xmath22 where the universal scaling function @xmath23 is the same for all models belonging to a given universality class whereas all non - universal system - dependent features ( e.g.  the lattice structure , the update scheme , etc . )",
    "are contained in the so - called non - universal metric factors @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "these factors are determined by three conditions which normalize the scaling function @xmath23 .",
    "first , the analytically known mean - field scaling function  @xcite @xmath27 should be recovered for @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , implying @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "finally , the non - universal metric factor  @xmath26 can be determined by the condition @xmath34 for @xmath35 yielding  @xcite @xmath36 the metric factors were already determined in previous works  @xcite , thus no parameter fitting is needed in order to perform the following scaling analysis .",
    "of the order parameter of the cttp and manna model at the critical density for @xmath37 .",
    "the metric factors are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the asymptotic behavior of the two - dimensional system ( @xmath40 ) and of the mean - field behavior ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the universal amplitude is given by @xmath42 .",
    "the inset displays the order parameter of the cttp for various values of the interaction range  @xmath43 ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "the dashed lines are just to guide the eyes .",

    "the universal function scales as @xmath49 with the universal amplitude @xmath50 .",
    "the scaling form eq.([eq : scal_plot_opcp_co ] ) has to equal for @xmath14 the @xmath51-dimensional scaling ansatz [ @xmath52 ] leading to @xmath53 according to the scaling form eq.([eq : scal_plot_opcp_co ] ) we plot in fig.[fig : uni_co_opcp_03 ] the rescaled order parameter @xmath54 as a function of the rescaled field @xmath55 .",
    "we observe an excellent data collapse for the full crossover behavior confirming the above phenomenological scaling ansatz .",
    "however , since the entire crossover region covered several decades it could be difficult to observe small but systematic differences between the scaling functions of both models .",
    "therefore , it its customary to scrutinize the crossover via the so - called effective exponent  @xcite @xmath56 the perfect collapse of the corresponding data is shown in fig.[fig : uni_co_beta_eff ] and confirms again the universality of the crossover scaling function  @xmath23 .    .",

    "we got an excellent data collapse including both asymptotic scaling regimes .",
    "the inset displays the effective exponent @xmath76 which exhibits again a monotonic crossover from the two - dimensional scaling regime to the mean - field scaling behavior .",
    "in this way we have obtained the effective exponents @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the field driven crossover from mean - field to non - mean - field behavior .",
    "thus we are able to check the corresponding widom scaling law @xmath79 for the whole crossover region .",
    "the corresponding data are shown in fig.[fig : widom_01 ] . as can be seen the widom scaling law",
