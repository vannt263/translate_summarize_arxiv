    "efficient four - wave mixing ( fwm ) processes in the context of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) [ 1 ] involving a double-@xmath2 scheme have been the subject of several recent studies [ 2 - 4 ] . in almost all of these studies ,",
    "a large atomic coherence has been considered to be a key player in yielding a high conversion efficiency . therefore ,",
    "maximum atomic coherence was assumed .",
    "furthermore , all studies available so far are based on either a steady - state approximation[2 - 4 ] or a full - numerical calculation[3 ] to obtain predictions on the system .",
    "a numerical calculation usually fails to yield as much insight into a problem as would be obtained from an analytical solution .",
    "the steady - state treatment is analytical , but it oversimplifies the problem and , in some cases , it leads to incorrect conclusions .",
    "in particular , it is known that a steady - state treatment of a four - level double-@xmath2 scheme can lead to an inconsistent solution in predicting quantum destructive interference effects that have profound relations to the wave mixing process . in this study",
    ", we describe an approximate analytical solution to a four - state double-@xmath2 scheme that is different from those studied previously [ 2 - 4 ] .",
    "three features distinguish the present study from previous works : ( 1 ) .",
    "a self - consistent fully time - dependent treatment leads to a three - photon destructive interference that extinguishes the laser excitation to the terminal state of a three - photon resonance , yet still provides nearly 25% frequency conversion efficiency .",
    "such a three - photon destructive interference together with a high conversion efficiency from a quenched fwm state have not previously been reported in any double-@xmath2 scheme in the context of eit , and can not be obtained from a simple steady - state treatment .",
    "we show that resonance excitation ( which leads to perfect one - photon eit ) is not the desired condition for optimum production of the mixing wave .",
    "we point out that sizable detunings from these resonances are required in order to avoid the three - photon destructive interference that limits the conversion efficiency , and ( 3 ) we show that , contrary to common beliefs , high conversion efficiency is not determined by having the maximum atomic coherence between the states @xmath0  and @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , in this four - wave mixing scheme very little depletion of the ground state occurs and @xmath4  remains very small throughout the probe pulse . the correct criteria for achieving high conversion efficiency is a combination of the conventional phase - matching condition and a condition that ensures the constructive interference between two terms in the expression for the fwm field . in order to make both of the two terms of comparable size",
    ", a relatively large detuning is required to reduce near resonance absorption of one part of the four - wave mixing field .",
    "consider a four - level system that interacts with two transform - limited lasers ( @xmath5  and @xmath6 , pulse length @xmath7 , fig.1 ) .",
    "a short pulse probe laser ( pulse length @xmath8 ) is tuned near the @xmath9 resonance and fired at a predetermined delay time .",
    "we assume that during the pulse length of the probe laser the two long pulsed lasers at @xmath10  and @xmath11 are sufficiently powerful to strongly saturate @xmath12 and @xmath13 transitions , therefore , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . as usual ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the one half rabi frequency and the amplitude of the field for the respective transitions .",
    "our objective is to seek a perturbative treatment for the response of the system to the short pulsed laser and to investigate the dynamics of the generated wave .",
    "we start with three equations of motion for the amplitudes of atomic wave function in the non - depleted ground state approximation .",
    "we thus require that @xmath18 , so that most of the population remains in state @xmath0 .",
    "taking @xmath19 , we have    @xmath20    in eqs.(1 ) , @xmath21  is the detuning from the two - photon resonance between @xmath0  and @xmath3 , @xmath22  is the detuning of the short pulse probe laser from the @xmath9  resonance , @xmath23 is the detuning from the three - photon resonance involving the transition @xmath24 .",
    "we will eventually assume that the lasers are tuned to the two - photon resonance @xmath25and that the lifetime of this state is very long .",
    "bear in mind that the generation of the four - wave mixing field will be shown to be very efficient , therefore , we must solve the above three equations of motion simultaneously with maxwell s equations for both the probe and the generated fields .",
    "taking unfocused beams and introducing @xmath26 where @xmath27  is the concentration in @xmath28 , maxwell s equations for these fields in slowly varying amplitude and phase approximation can be expressed as    @xmath29    notice that in the present model , there exist two very different time scales , i.e. @xmath8 , therefore , if the probe pulse occurs at the peak of the long pulse lasers , the amplitudes of the latter will remain nearly constant through the entire probe pulse .",
    "we therefore will be seeking a fully time dependent response of the system during the period when the probe pulse is present while treating both long pulse laser fields as time independent quantities . with this method in mind , eqs.(1 ) and",
    "( 2 ) can be solved analytically .",
    "taking fourier transform on the both sides of eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) , we obtain    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34  and @xmath35  are the fourier transforms of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39  and @xmath40 , respectively . eqs .",
    "( 3a-3c ) can be solved in terms of @xmath34  and @xmath35  with the result    @xmath41    where , @xmath42 when these equations are used in eqs ( 3d-3e ) , we obtain    @xmath43    for given @xmath44 and with @xmath45 , eqs ( 5 ) can be solved analytically , yielding    @xmath46    where we have defined the new parameters    @xmath47    if we use , for the probe laser at the entrance to the medium , @xmath48 we find @xmath49 where we have introduced the dimensionless variable @xmath50 .",
    "we then get    @xmath51.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the following section , we will discuss the physical implications of eq.(8 ) by examining some limiting cases where eq.(8 ) can be evaluated analytically . in section iv , we will evaluates eqs .",
    "( 8) numerically and compare the results with the analytical approximations .",
    "in this section we focus on the physical interpretation of eqs.(8 ) .",
    "we will consider some limiting cases where the inverse transform of the generated field can be carried out analytically .",
    "these limiting cases provide a great deal of insight into the wave propagation effects .",
    "consider the limiting case where @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , in what follows we shall always use @xmath53  and assume that state @xmath3  is a second hyperfine level of the ground state , so that in an ultra - cold vapor @xmath54 . in this case",
    "the width of state @xmath3 is determined by the very slow rate of collisions between the atoms of cold low density vapor . under these conditions , an accurate approximation to the parameters in eqs .",
    "( 7 ) can be obtained by assuming @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . within this limit",
    "we can expand @xmath2  by making use of the assumption that either @xmath57 , or @xmath58  is much larger than either @xmath59  or @xmath60 , therefore , @xmath61 if we replace @xmath62  and @xmath63  in the inverse transform by complex exponentials , this approximation allows us to evaluate part of the integrals analytically for arbitrary pulse shape . when the detunings @xmath22  and @xmath23are very small compared with the half - rabi frequencies , the other integrals are damped out in a small distance due to absorption .",
    "we first analyze the case where @xmath64 , i.e. all lasers are tuned exactly on the unperturbed resonances .",
    "this is the limit where one - photon eit is achieved . in this limit",
    "we find that after a large propagation distance , and at a point where the fwm has built up sufficiently    @xmath65    where @xmath66 this result indicates that in this limit @xmath67.[5 ] indeed , eq .",
    "( 4c ) shows that in this limit @xmath68  for all @xmath69 , providing @xmath70  is large enough to make @xmath71/\\delta])|<<1 $ ] .",
    "it is required that @xmath72  in order for @xmath73to imply that @xmath74 .",
    "in other words , @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath81 @xmath85 . [ 6 ] we emphasize that this suppression of the excitation of the state @xmath86 can not be obtained from the usual steady - state treatment of the atomic equations of motion . indeed , the condition derived in the steady - state frame work for a three - photon destructive interference leads to an inconsistent prediction of the effect .",
    "we have evaluated the special case where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89,@xmath90 , @xmath91 using both eq.(10 ) and numerical integration of eq.(8 ) . as will be seen",
    "later the approximate analytical solution is in excellent agreement with the numerical evaluation and the ratio of @xmath92  at @xmath93  cm is equal to a constant ( at all t where the two quantities are greater than @xmath94  of their peak values ) to an accuracy of seven significant figures . to this accuracy",
    ", the constant ratio is equal to @xmath95 .",
    "also , the peak in the two half - rabi frequencies occurs at the point predicted by the group velocity @xmath96 .",
    "note that if one allows @xmath97 then @xmath96  reduces to the expression appropriate to the extremely slow wave propagation experiment [ 8 ] , as should be the case .",
    "it should be pointed out that the destructive interference predicted above is equivalent to eit for both the four - wave mixing photons and the probe laser photons . to see this clearly , consider the condition for eq .",
    "( 1b ) to predict @xmath98 at a point in space .",
    "this would be the case if @xmath99 at all times . with this amplitude for @xmath36  the coupling terms",
    "destructively interfere .",
    "this is what happens when eit occurs for the probe laser , for in this case there is no polarization to lowest order at @xmath100 .",
    "correspondingly , in order to have eit at the four - wave mixing frequency we must have @xmath101 .",
    "looking at eq .",
    "( 1c ) , we see that this requires @xmath102 . in order for eit to occur at both frequencies ,",
    "the two values of @xmath36  must be the same .",
    "this yields @xmath103 .",
    "the same relation holds in eqs .",
    "( 10 ) .",
    "we now consider the situation where @xmath104 , @xmath105  and @xmath54 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath106 , but @xmath107    where we have introduced notations @xmath108    in the expression of @xmath109  we have neglected a term that is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath110 , since such a term is much smaller than @xmath111  in the above equation when the half - rabi frequencies are much larger than the detunings .",
    "eq.(11 ) indicates that there are two contributions to the growth of the fwm field @xmath112 .",
    "the first contribution is due to the probe field that travels at the group velocity @xmath96 , whereas the second term consists of a probe field that travels at a second group velocity , @xmath109 .",
    "if these two parts do not separate appreciably before a distance @xmath70 such that @xmath113  is reached , the two parts will interfere constructively . in the case",
    "where @xmath114 , this requires that @xmath115  and @xmath116 .",
    "the latter condition puts restrictions on @xmath117  and @xmath118 , as compared with @xmath119  and @xmath120",
    ". the photon flux conversion efficiency under this condition can be found as @xmath121 where @xmath122 in eq.(12 ) , @xmath123  and @xmath124  are the photon fluxes for the fwm and probe fields , respectively , and in deriving this expression we have , for the mathematical simplicity , assumed a gaussian pulse shape for the probe field so that @xmath125 .",
    "> from eq.(12 ) , we notice that if we choose @xmath113  and @xmath126 , then we obtain @xmath127 .",
    "this implies that the conversion efficiency is close to 100% whenever the difference between @xmath96  and @xmath109  is small and the absorbtion factor @xmath128 .",
    "extensive numerical calculations have verified that conversion efficiencies of nearly 100% are indeed produced when the conditions stated before are well satisfied .    in the case where the three - photon destructive interference does occur",
    ", i.e. in the case when perfect one - photon eit is established with @xmath129 , the second term in eq.(12 ) disappears and the integral can be evaluated analytically .",
    "the result is a nearly 25% conversion efficiency in spite of the fact that the fwm field is strongly suppressed and there will be no further production of the field in the rest of medium .",
    "this indicates that for the scheme studied here , achieving one - photon eit is detrimental to the high flux conversion efficiency .",
    "therefore , one prefers to detune the two long pulsed lasers from the perspective resonances in order to avoid the destructive interference .",
    "another important conclusion that can be immediately deduced from eq.(9 ) is that it shows that maximum atomic coherence is not the optimum choice for maximum conversion efficiency as previously suggested [ 2 ] .",
    "indeed , there are two conditions that must be met in order to achieve maximum conversion efficiency .",
    "the first one is the combination of @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 that maximize the amplitude of the expression in eqs.(10 - 12 ) .",
    "it has been shown [ 7 ] that this is precisely the conventional phase - matching condition for efficient wave mixing process .",
    "the second condition that must be met is that the propagation distance must be chosen properly in order to make the two terms in eq.(12 ) interfere constructively .",
    "it is the combination of these two conditions that enables a highly efficient wave mixing and flux conversion process .",
    "in this section , we investigate the model system numerically .",
    "our main focus is to study the validity of eq.(12 ) under specified conditions .",
    "this expression gives a complete description , under the conditions prescribed , on the flux conversion efficient with the field propagation effect included .",
    "it contains all the functional dependence of the fwm field on time , propagation distance , rabi frequencies and detunings",
    ". we will first compare eq.(12 ) with direct numerical evaluation of the inverse transform in order to show the validity of our approximation that leads to analytical results .",
    "after having established the validity of the analytical result , we then investigate the functional dependence of the conversion efficiency on parameters such as detunings and pumping rabi frequencies , which may be useful in experimental verification of the theory .",
    "as mentioned before , the probe field propagation , generation of the fwm field , and the high - efficiency photon flux conversion described in the previous sections have all been verified through extensive numerical calculations . in figure 2a , we first show , for a typical set of parameters , the conversion efficiency predicted by the approximation ( eq.(12 ) ) and by direct numerical integration of the inverse transform as a function of @xmath134 .",
    "the parameters are so chosen that the three - photon destructive interference is defeated , therefore , both terms in eq.(12 ) contribute to the overall conversion efficiency .",
    "furthermore , we have chosen the parameters that maximizes the amplitude of the expression given in eq.(11 ) .",
    "the graph shows an excellent agreement between the approximate solution and the numerical evaluation of the inverse transform , and both methods predict nearly 100% conversion efficiency . in figure 2b , a different set of propagation parameters are chosen under the condition where the three - photon destructive interference is not present .",
    "again , the plot shows an excellent agreement between the two methods .",
    "these results indicate that the analytical result eq.(12 ) can , under the conditions given , correctly predict the propagation effect of the generated field .",
    "therefore , we will use eq.(12 ) to explore the functional dependence of the conversion efficient to various detunings and power densities .",
    "as has mentioned before , eit process is established when both long pulse laser are tuned on resonance , i.e. @xmath135 . the resulting conversion efficiency can be analytically obtained . in figure 3a",
    ", we show the dependence of the efficiency as function of @xmath136 . as the detuning of the second laser from the resonance",
    "is increased , the efficiency increases , as expected . the similar effect due to the detuning @xmath137 is also shown in figure 3b .",
    "these figures indicate that for optimum operation , one should choose non - vanishing detunings which also satisfy the conditions forth set for the rabi frequencies . finally , we investigate the dependence of the conversion efficiency on laser powers .",
    "first , it is obvious that eq.(9 ) is independent of the power of the probe laser . in figure 4",
    ", we plot the efficiency as function of @xmath138 .",
    "as expected , the maximum conversion efficiency is achieved only at @xmath139 , a necessary condition , for a given @xmath140 , in order to achieve phase matching for the generated weave .    in conclusion",
    ", we have presented an approximate analytical solution to a four - level double-@xmath2 scheme where laser induced transparency is expected .",
    "we predict that when the detunings from the three - photon resonance is small , and therefore the usual one - photon eit process is established , the fwm field propagates without suffering any pulse distortion . under these conditions",
    ", we also predict that at a sufficient propagation depth a complete three - photon destructive interference involving the fwm field and the three laser fields will reduce the polarization at the four - wave mixing frequency to zero .",
    "we have shown that even with such a robust three - photon destructive interference that strongly suppresses further generation of the fwm field beyond an onset propagation distance , the photon flux conversion efficiency can still be as high as 25% .",
    "our result , however , indicates that one should detune both pump lasers from the perspective resonances , thereby avoid the usual one - photon eit process . the use of a significant detuning will defeat a possible three - photon destructive interference ( that limits the further production of the internally generated wave and therefore limits conversion efficiency to 25 % ) therefore , allowing photon flux conversion efficiencies close to 100% with",
    "even _ a very weak probe field_. in addition , our calculation shows that , contrary to common belief , a maximum atomic coherence between the two lower states is not the optimum condition for achieving maximum conversion efficiency . indeed , with the current scheme @xmath141 .",
    "for high conversion efficiency , proper atomic parameters should be chosen according to eqs.(11 ) and ( 12 ) .",

    "this study assumed that four externally generated laser fields , with their phase properties being precisely controlled , couples all four levels , therefore , no generated field is involved .",
    "it is not surprising that with precise control of the phase of all laser field , a two - photon cancellation is predicted by this study . since this steady - treatment",
    "does not include the light propagation , therefore could not predict any propagation based interference effect as demonstrated in the present study .",

    "further , it is fundamentally different that in the case where the generated field is excluded , as in ref . [ 4 ] , there is no appreciable effect due to wave propagation , therefore can only be achieved at very low concentration such as atomic beam . in the case where the mixing wave participates in the process , the destructive interference is readily observable even at elevated concentrations .",
