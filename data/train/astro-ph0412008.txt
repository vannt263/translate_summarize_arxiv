    "amongst the distinct methods available for the study of the integrated light of stellar populations it is the evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) method ( first introduced by tinsley 1968 ) that offers the most direct approach for modelling galaxies .",
    "remarkable progress in this field has been made during the past decades but the majority of eps studies have tended to focus solely on the evolution of single stars @xcite .",
    "both observation and theory tell us that binary stars play a very important role in the evolution of stellar population .",
    "first , observations show that upwards of 50% of the stars populating galaxies are expected to be in binary or higher - order multiple systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "secondly , binary evolution , if the component stars are close enough to exchange mass , can drastically alter the evolution path of a star as expected from single star evolution .",
    "moreover , binary interactions can also create some important classes of objects such as blue stragglers ( bss : @xcite ) , and subdwarf b stars ( sdbs , also referred as extreme horizontal branch [ ehb ] stars : @xcite ) .",
    "these objects produced by binary evolution channels , can significantly affect the integrated spectral energy distribution ( ised ) of a population from ultraviolet ( uv ) to radio ranges .",
    "therefore it is necessary to include binary stars in eps models .",
    "however , in the few eps studies to date that have accounted for binary evolution , some only included specialised classes of binaries ( for example , massive close binary evolution : @xcite ) , while others were limited to studying specialised stellar populations ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". the eps study of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) took into account various known classes of binary stars and investigated general populations but they only considered solar metallicity populations .",
    "this paper expands that study by including a metallicity dependence and by investigating the effects of binary interactions and model input parameters on the results .",
    "furthermore , by using @xmath7 instead of @xmath8 binary systems the error in the calculations is reduced and the solar metallicity results of paper i are superceded .    in this paper",
    "we assume that all stars are born in binaries and born at the same time , i.e. an instantaneous binary stellar population ( bsp ) .",
    "eps models of instantaneous burst bsps require four key ingredients : ( i ) a library of evolutionary tracks ( including binary stars and single stars ) used to calculate isochrones in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) ; ( ii ) a library of stellar spectra adopted in order to derive the ised , or magnitudes and colours , in suitable passbands ; ( iii ) a method to transform spectral information to absorption - line strengths , for example , the approach of empirical fitting polynomials @xcite ; and ( iv ) assumptions regarding the various distributions required for initialization of the binary population , such as the initial mass function ( imf ) of the primaries and the distribution of orbital separations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we describe our eps models and algorithm in section 2 ; our results are presented in section 3 and in section 4 we investigate the influences of binary interactions , model input parameters and distribution functions on the results ; and then finally , in section 5 , we give our conclusions .",
    "the eps code used here was developed by zhang and colleagues @xcite and is based on the most updated input physics .",
    "here we briefly describe the important features and components of the model as well as providing details of the algorithm for computing a bsp .      to investigate the effect of binary interactions on the eps study of stellar populations we first need to construct the instantaneous burst bsps .",
    "the evolution path taken by a star in a binary depends critically on the mass of the companion star and the orbital parameters . as such",
    ", binary evolution can be very complex and it is difficult to estimate the evolutionary timescales of the two stars without actually evolving the system .",
    "therefore , the traditional method of constructing populations used in the eps study of single stellar populations , where only the imf need be considered and the evolutionary timescale of a star is set as soon as its mass is set , confronts difficulty in the study of bsps .",
    "here we need to use a monte carlo process , which utilises a random - number generator in combination with distribution functions , to generate the initial conditions of a set of binaries which then need to be evolved using an appropriate binary evolution model .    to generate a bsp",
    "the following input distributions are required to define the initial state of each binary : ( i ) the imf of the primaries , which gives the relative number of the primaries in the mass range @xmath9 ; ( ii ) the secondary - mass distribution ; ( iii ) the distribution of orbital separations ( or periods ) ; and ( iv ) the eccentricity distribution . for distributions",
    "for which the majority of studies have reached fair agreement , such as the primary - mass and orbital separation distributions , we use a certain form while for those that are less constrained ( secondary - mass and eccentricity ) we use several reasonable assumptions .",
    "we also need to set the lower and upper mass cut - offs @xmath10 and @xmath11 to the mass distributions and assign a metallicity @xmath12 to the stars .    for each binary system",
    "the initial mass of the primary is chosen from the approximation to the imf of @xcite as given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter eft ) , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a random variable uniformly distributed in the range [ 0,1 ] , and @xmath15 is the primary mass in units of @xmath16 .    in choosing the initial mass of the secondary star we can assume that the masses of the component stars are either correlated or that they are independent . for the correlated case , the secondary - mass distribution depends on the primary - mass ( as set by equation [ mdis ] ) and the mass - ratio , @xmath17 , distribution .",
    "the form of the latter is somewhat uncertain and a matter for debate . in this study",
    "we consider two versions of the @xmath17 distribution , one is a uniform distribution ( eft 1989 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and the other is a thermal distribution @xcite , @xmath20 in the uncorrelated case , the secondary mass is chosen independently from the same imf as the primary ( equation [ mdis ] ) .",
    "the distribution of orbital separations is taken as constant in @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the separation ) for wide binaries and falls off smoothly at close separations : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this distribution implies that there are equal numbers of wide binary systems per logarithmic interval , and that approximately 50% of the binary systems have orbital periods less than 100yr .",
    "the value of 100yr can be viewed as the upper limit for interaction between the component stars ",
    "if the period is longer than 100yr the evolution of the stars does not differ from that of two independent single stars .",
    "this fraction of 50% for binaries with a period less than 100yr is a typical value for the galaxy , resulting in @xmath28 of the binaries experiencing roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) during the past 13gyr .    in order to investigate the effect of eccentricity we consider two eccentricity distributions : ( i ) all binaries are initially circular , i.e. @xmath29 and ( ii ) all binaries are formed in eccentric orbits where the initial eccentricity distribution satisfies a uniform form , i.e. , @xmath30 under this second assumption large eccentricities in short - period orbits are to be excluded on the basis that the stars will crash into each other at periastron .    equations ( [ mdis ] ) - ( [ edis2 ] ) can be used to set the initial state of a binary system : the masses of the component stars , @xmath15 and @xmath31 , separation , @xmath22 , and eccentricity , @xmath32 , of the orbit .      to describe the evolution of a binary we use the rapid binary star evolution ( bse ) algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the bse algorithm provides the stellar luminosity @xmath33 , effective temperature @xmath34 , radius @xmath35 , current mass @xmath36 and the ratio of radius to roche - lobe radius @xmath37 for the component stars , as well as the period @xmath38 , separation @xmath22 and eccentricity @xmath32 for a binary system .",
    "it is valid for component star masses in the range @xmath39 , metallicity @xmath40 , and eccentricity @xmath41 .",
    "the bse algorithm includes the single star evolution ( sse ) package of analytic formulae as presented by @xcite in its entirety .",
    "in fact , for orbits that are wide enough that mass exchange between the component stars does not take place , the evolutionary parameters of the stars are identical to that given by the sse package .",
    "the sse package comprises a set of analytic evolution functions fitted to the model tracks of @xcite .",
    "detailed descriptions of the stellar evolutionary models of @xcite and the sse package have been presented previously in zhang et al .",
    "( 2002 : see sec .",
    "2 ) , so we do not discuss them here .",
    "in addition to all aspects of single star evolution , the bse algorithm models processes such as mass transfer , mass accretion , common - envelope ( ce ) evolution , collisions , supernova kicks , tidal evolution , and all angular momentum loss mechanisms .",
    "this is done mostly by using a prescription ( or recipe ) based approach .    for the bse code",
    "there are several important input parameters that require mention :    * \\(i ) the efficiency of ce ejection @xmath42 in the ce evolution model denotes the fraction of the orbital energy that is transferred to the envelope and is used to overcome the binding energy .",
    "this efficiency is defined @xcite by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the change in the orbital energy of the binary between the initial and final state of the spiraling - in process and @xmath45 is the energy added to the binding energy of the envelope . if the envelope is ejected before complete spiral - in then a close binary is the result , otherwise the two stars will coalesce .",
    "this parameter is crucial in understanding the evolution of populations of binary systems because it determines the outcome of a ce interaction . in our bsp study",
    "we vary it over a reasonable range ( @xmath46 ) to investigate its effects . *",
    "\\(ii ) the coefficient @xmath47 for reimers wind mass - loss @xcite , @xmath48 where stellar luminosity , @xmath33 , radius , @xmath35 , and mass @xmath36 , are all in solar units . equation ( [ wrei ] ) gives the wind mass - loss rate for intermediate and low - mass stars on the giant branch and beyond . in this study",
    "we vary @xmath47 from 0.5 to 0.0 . *",
    "\\(iii ) the tidal enhancement parameter @xmath49 , which appears in the formula of tidally enhanced mass loss given by @xcite , @xmath50 \\label{wenh}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the reimers rate ( see equation [ wrei ] ) and @xmath52 is the roche lobe radius .",
    "equation ( [ wenh ] ) is used to increase the incidence of rs cvn binaries . in this study",
    "we do not consider tidally enhanced mass loss , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "the basel-2.0 stellar spectra library of @xcite provides an extensive and homogeneous grid of low - resolution theoretical flux distributions in the range of @xmath54 nm , and synthetic ubvrijhklm colours for a large range of stellar parameters : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 } \\leq -5.0 $ ] ( where @xmath58 denotes surface gravity ) . for this library correction functions",
    "have been calculated for each value of the @xmath59 and for each wavelength in order to yield synthetic ubvrijhklm colours matching the empirical colour-@xmath60 calibrations derived from observations at solar metallicity .",
    "semi - empirical calibrations for non - solar abundances ( @xmath61 = -3.5 $ ] to + 1.0 ) have also been established for this version of the library . after correction the most important systematic differences existing between the original model spectra and the observations",
    "are eliminated .",
    "furthermore , synthetic ubv and washington ultraviolet excesses @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , obtained from the original model spectra of giants and dwarfs , are in excellent agreement with the empirical metal - abundance calibrations .",
    "the empirical fitting functions of @xcite give absorption - line indices defined by the lick observatory image dissector scanner ( lick / ids ) system as a function of @xmath59 , @xmath65 , and metallicity [ fe / h ] .",

    "the indices in the lick system were extracted from the spectra of 460 stars obtained between 1972 and 1984 using the red - sensitive ids and cassegrain spectrograph on the 3 m shane telescope at lick observatory .",
    "the spectra cover the range @xmath68  , with a resolution of @xmath69 @xcite . a more detailed description of the lick / ids spectral absorption - feature indices has been presented in zhang et al .",
    "( 2004a : see sec .",
    "2 ) .      after choosing a seed for the random number generator we use the monte carlo eqns ( [ mdis ] ) - ( [ edis2 ] ) to produce a population of @xmath7 binary systems . in this work",
    "the lower and upper mass cut - offs @xmath10 and @xmath11 are taken as 0.1 @xmath70 and 100 @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the relative age , @xmath72 , of the bsp is assigned within the range of @xmath0gyr and the metallicity is chosen within the limits @xmath73 .",
    "we can then use the bse algorithm to evolve each binary in the bsp to an age of @xmath72 which gives us evolutionary parameters such as @xmath33 , @xmath74 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the component stars .",
    "next we use the basel-2.0 stellar spectra to transform the evolutionary parameters to colours and stellar flux and then use the empirical fitting functions of @xcite to derive spectral absorption feature indices in the lick / ids system . finally , by the following equations ( [ inte - c ] ) - ( [ inte - mag ] ) we can obtain the integrated colours , monochromatic flux and absorption feature indices for an instantaneous bsp of a particular age and metallicity .",
    "we note that the common - envelope phase of binary evolution is assumed to be instantaneous in the bse algorithm and thus it is not a factor when calculating the flux .",
    "other aspects of binary evolution that may affect the observed flux , such as the presence of an accretion disc or novae eruptions , are also not taken into account , i.e. we only consider the stellar parameters .    in the following equations , a parameter identified by a capital letter on the left - hand side represents the integrated bsp , while the corresponding parameter in minuscule on the right - hand side is for the @xmath75th star .",

    "we have simulated realistic stellar populations composed of 100% binaries by producing @xmath7 binary systems using a monte carlo technique . using the eps method we computed the integrated colours , iseds and lick / ids absorption feature indices for an extensive set of instantaneous burst bsps with and without binary interactions over a large range of age and metallicity : 1gyr @xmath186 15gyr and @xmath187 } \\le 0.2 $ ] . in our eps models we adopted the rapid sse and bse algorithms for the single and binary evolution tracks , the empirical and semi - empirical calibrated basel-2.0 model for the library of stellar spectra and empirical fitting functions for the lick / ids spectral absorption feature indices . by comparing the results for populations with and without binary interactions",
    "we show that the inclusion of binary interactions makes each quantity we have considered bluer and the appearance of the population younger or the metallicity lower .",
    "also we have investigated the effect of input parameters ( the ce ejection efficiency @xmath94 and the reimers wind mass - loss coefficient @xmath47 ) and the input distributions ( eccentricity and the initial mass of the secondaries ) on the integrated @xmath2 and @xmath3 colours of a solar - metallicity bsp .",
    "the results reveal that the variations in these parameters / distributions can significantly affect the results . comparing the discrepancies in the integrated colours for all models , we find that the differences between the models with and without binary interactions are greater than those caused by the variations in the choice of input parameters and distributions . based on",
    "the above results an important conclusion can be drawn that it is very necessary to include binary interactions in eps studies .    the integrated colours and lick / ids absorption - line indices for models b - f , and the iseds for all models are not given for the sake of the length of the paper but are available on request .",

    "<S> using evolutionary population synthesis we present integrated colours , integrated spectral energy distributions and absorption - line indices defined by the lick observatory image dissector scanner ( referred to as lick / ids ) system , for an extensive set of instantaneous burst binary stellar populations with and without binary interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the ages of the populations are in the range @xmath0gyr and the metallicities are in the range @xmath1 . by comparing the results for populations with and without binary interactions </S>",
    "<S> we show that the inclusion of binary interactions makes the integrated @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 colours and all lick / ids spectral absorption indices ( except for @xmath6 ) substantially smaller . </S>",
    "<S> in other words binary evolution makes a population appear bluer . </S>",
    "<S> this effect raises the derived age and metallicity of the population .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate several sets of additional solar - metallicity binary stellar populations to explore the influence of input parameters to the binary evolution algorithm ( the common - envelope ejection efficiency and the stellar wind mass - loss rate ) on the resulting integrated colours . </S>",
    "<S> we also look at the dependence on the choice of distribution functions used to generate the initial binary population . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that variations in the choice of input model parameters and distributions can significantly affect the results . </S>",
    "<S> however , comparing the discrepancies that exist between the colours of various models , we find that the differences are less than those produced between the models with and those without binary interactions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is very necessary to consider binary interactions in order to draw accurate conclusions from evolutionary population synthesis work .    </S>",
