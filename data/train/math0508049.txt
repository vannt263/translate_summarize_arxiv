    "since the remarkable paper of s. k. donaldson [ d1 ] appeared in 1983 , yang - mills gauge theory has been one of central themes in geometry and mathematical physics .",
    "there are plenty of papers on this subject , and many interesting theories have been developed .",
    "but most of them study only _ finite energy _",
    "asd connections and their _ finite dimensional _ moduli spaces .",
    "we know little about _ infinite energy _ asd connections and their moduli spaces .",
    "in fact i do nt know even whether such connections exist in general situations .",
    "this paper is one step in this direction .",
    "we will show that we can construct a huge amount of infinite energy asd connections by using a `` gluing construction '' .",
    "gluing asd connections is a well - known technique in yang - mills theory [ d1 ] , [ d2 ] , [ dfk ] , [ dk ] , [ fu ] , [ t1 ] , [ t2 ] , but we usually study a gluing of two ( or a finite number of ) instantons . in this paper",
    "we study a gluing of infinitely many instantons , and show that this new gluing technique produces the desired infinite energy asd connections .",
    "moreover we show that the construction of  gluing an infinite number of instantons \" has the following interesting new feature ; to define the gluing of asd connections , we need to introduce a  gluing parameter space \" , which is isomorphic to @xmath0 in the case of gluing two @xmath0 instantons . in the case of gluing infinitely many @xmath0 instantons , the gluing parameter space becomes the _",
    "infinite product _ of the copies of @xmath0 .",
    "this gigantic parameter space is the interesting new feature of our approach .",
    "although the above  infinite dimensional gluing parameter space \" is the source of the richness of the construction , it also causes several serious difficulties in analysis .",
    "in particular , we can not use the usual fredholm deformation theory because of infinite degrees of freedom of the parameter space .",
    "we overcome this difficulty by adapting donaldson s `` alternating method '' in [ d2 ] to this situation .",
    "this decomposes the problem into an infinite number of small pieces where we can use the usual fredholm deformation theory .",
    "i think that the technique of  gluing an infinite number of instantons \" probably can be applied to other equations which studies an  infinite energy \" situation for selfdual vortices in @xmath1 . from [ mnr ]",
    "i learned that there is a paper of s. angenent [ a ] which develops a gluing technique for infinitely many solutions of an elliptic pde of the form @xmath2 in @xmath3 .",
    "[ mnr ] adapts this gluing technique to an elliptic equation with singular sources .",
    "i think that our alternating method is different from the analytic technique in [ a ] . ] , e.g. , the seiberg - witten equation , pseudo - holomorphic curves , etc .",
    "in fact the classical mittag - leffler theorem in complex analysis can be considered as a variant of this gluing technique .",
    "singularities of a meromorphic function are instanton - like objects , and the mittag - leffler theorem constructs a meromorphic function which has an infinite number of singularities given in the complex plane . in other words the result of this paper is a yang - mills analogue of the mittag - leffler theorem .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present notation and state main theorems .",
    "we establish basic estimates in section 3 .",
    "the details of the gluing construction are given in section 4 .",

    "but we do nt need this fact in this paper .",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ thm : construction ] .",
    "let @xmath265 be a sequence of gluing data of finite type as in section 2 .",
    "the finite type condition means that we can apply the estimates in section 3 to all @xmath266 with the _ same _ constants .",
    "( this is the reason for introducing this notion . )    to begin with , we make one remark on the conformal transformation ( [ conformal map ] ) which identifies @xmath61 and @xmath70 :    [ rem : conformal map ] the coordinate transformation ( [ conformal map ] ) is only conformal and not an isometry .",
    "hence the metric of @xmath81 is different from the metric of @xmath267 over the identified region @xmath94 .",
    "the derivative of ( [ conformal map ] ) over @xmath268 has the following bound independent of @xmath43 : @xmath269 here @xmath270 is the operator norm . in particular , if @xmath271 , then @xmath272 it follows that @xmath273 for a 2-form @xmath274 under the identification @xmath275 .",
    "let @xmath276 be a gluing parameter , ( @xmath277 ) , and @xmath99 be the principal @xmath4 bundle over @xmath78 defined in section [ subsection : gluing construction ] . as we explained in section [ subsection : outline ]",
    ", we will inductively construct a sequence of connections @xmath119 , @xmath123 , @xmath126 , @xmath278 , on @xmath99 which converges to an asd connection @xmath101 .",
    "this is a generalization of the alternating method in [ d2 , iv ( iv ) ] . at the @xmath136-th stage of the iteration",
    "we will have a connection @xmath137 which is expressed by @xmath279 here @xmath280 is an element of @xmath281 over @xmath67 and we have @xmath282 over @xmath283 under the identification @xmath93 .",
    "then they compatibly define the connection @xmath137 on @xmath99 .",
    "let us consider the following  inductive hypotheses \" :    [ inductive hypotheses ] ( i ) let @xmath284 be the self - dual curvature of @xmath285 , and set @xmath286 here @xmath287 is the restriction of @xmath288 on @xmath67 .",
    "( we extend @xmath289 to @xmath81 by zero . )",
    "we suppose that @xmath288 is supported as follows : @xmath290 and we suppose that @xmath291 has the following bound : @xmath292    \\(ii ) we suppose that @xmath293 has the following bound : @xmath294    if these conditions hold at the @xmath136-th stage of the iteration and @xmath180 , then we can pass to the @xmath295-th stage as follows .",
    "if @xmath136 is even , then we use the construction in section 3 on each @xmath122 and get @xmath296 .",
    "we define @xmath297 over @xmath67 by @xmath298 here @xmath299 is a cut - off over @xmath81 as in section 3 .",
    "note that @xmath300 and @xmath301 are well - defined over @xmath302 .",
    "from the arguments in section 3 and proposition [ prop : estimate for construction ] ( ii)@xmath303 at the end of section 3 , we have @xmath304 @xmath305 taking account of remark [ rem : conformal map ] , we have @xmath306 thus @xmath307 if @xmath136 is odd , then we use proposition [ prop : estimate for construction ] over each @xmath125 and construct a similar procedure to pass to the @xmath295-th stage . the estimate ( [ er.term ] ) holds as long as we can continue this iteration .",
    "hence @xmath308 we start the iteration by defining @xmath309 by @xmath310 here each @xmath102 is the connection matrix in the exponential gauge centered at @xmath311 and @xmath72",
    ". these expressions are well - defined on @xmath302 or @xmath312 and compatible over the overlap regions .",
    "the self - dual curvature of @xmath119 is supported in @xmath313 . since each",
    "@xmath314 is @xmath315 and @xmath316 is @xmath317 ( cf .",

    "the geometric decay ( [ geo.decay ] ) shows that the condition ( i ) in hypotheses 4.2 is always satisfied as long as the condition ( ii ) is valid . at the @xmath136-th stage of the iteration ,",
    "if @xmath136 is even , proposition 3.1 ( i ) shows @xmath322 from remark [ rem : conformal map ] , @xmath323 we have similar estimates when @xmath136 is odd , and @xmath324 hence the condition ( ii ) in hypotheses 4.2 is satisfied for any @xmath136 if we choose @xmath43 small enough .",

    "proposition 3.1 ( iii ) and an argument similar to the above show that @xmath325 converges to @xmath328 also in @xmath329 . from the geometric decay ( [ geo.decay ] ) ,",
    "the self - dual curvature of @xmath330 becomes @xmath135 .",
    "thus we get an asd connection @xmath331 ( [ total error ] ) shows that this is close to @xmath102 over each @xmath67 : @xmath332 so we get a conclusion :    for all sufficiently small @xmath43 , @xmath101 is an asd connection on @xmath99 such that @xmath333 here @xmath334 is a constant independent of @xmath335 , @xmath112 , @xmath43 .    in general this asd connection",
    "@xmath101 has infinite energy :    if there are infinitely many non - flat asd connections @xmath102 in the given sequence of gluing data , then the @xmath108-energy of @xmath101 is infinite : @xmath336 .",
    "we will show that the loss of energy over each @xmath67 during the iteration is sufficiently small . at the @xmath136-th stage of the iteration ,",
    "if @xmath136 is even , we can apply proposition 3.1 ( iv ) to ( [ iteration1 ] ) and get @xmath337 since @xmath338 is supported in the overlaps and the @xmath108-norm of a 2-form is conformally invariant , @xmath339 we have the same estimates in the case that @xmath136 is odd .",
    "hence @xmath340 next we will show that @xmath341 is also small .",
    "an estimate similar to ( [ ini.error ] ) shows @xmath342 since this is supported in the overlaps , we get @xmath343 hence @xmath344    from the finite type condition , we have a positive constant @xmath345 independent of @xmath43 such that @xmath346 if @xmath102 is not flat and @xmath43 is sufficiently small . therefore if we take @xmath180 , then @xmath347 for non - flat @xmath102 .",
    "since there are infinitely many non - flat @xmath102 , we conclude that @xmath348",
    "we will prove theorem [ thm : injectivity ] in this section .",
    "the proof is a generalization of [ d2 , ( 4.31 ) lemma ] .",

    "since the distance @xmath376 is equivalent to @xmath377 : @xmath378 we have @xmath379 .",
    "let @xmath380 be the connection on @xmath381 constructed by the iterative process in section 4 ; this is parametrized by @xmath231 and we can apply proposition 3.2 .",
    "we define @xmath382 and @xmath383 by @xmath384 from the definition of @xmath385 in ( [ ini.value1 ] ) , @xmath386 here we used the fact that the connection matrices in the exponential gauges are @xmath315 .",
    "since @xmath387 is supported in the overlaps , we get @xmath388 in a similar way , we have @xmath389 hence @xmath390    next we will establish recurrence inequalities on @xmath391 and @xmath392 . if @xmath136 is even , then proposition 3.1 and 3.2 give bounds for @xmath393 and @xmath394 . then , from the inductive definitions ( [ iteration1 ] ) and the geometric decay ( [ geo.decay ] ) , @xmath395 it follows that @xmath396 similarly , from proposition 3.2 ( ii)@xmath303 at the end of section 3 , @xmath397 since @xmath398 on @xmath399 and @xmath400 on @xmath401 , we get @xmath402 here we have used remark [ rem : conformal map ] .",
    "this shows @xmath403 the inequalities ( [ iteration3 ] ) , ( [ iteration4 ] ) hold also in the case that @xmath136 is odd .",
    "so we can apply lemma [ lem : recurrence ] with initial values ( [ ini.value3 ] ) and @xmath404 .",
