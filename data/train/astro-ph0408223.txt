    "the determination of lithium and beryllium photospheric abundances can reveal and improve the understanding of processes occurring in the stellar interior , with simultaneous measurements of both li and be being sensitive to mixing , diffusion and other poorly understood transport processes .",
    "this work focuses specifically on the super li - rich star , j37 , discovered in september 2002 which is a photometric , proper motion and radial velocity member of ngc6633 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* deliyannis  2002 ) ) .",
    "the star itself is a late a or early f dwarf and as such should possess a very shallow convection zone as well as being a slow rotator for its spectral class at 29 @xmath1 2 @xmath5 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* deliyannis  2002 ) ) .",
    "this relatively thin mixing layer allows physical processes to produce observable effects that are mostly negligible in cooler dwarfs thus making j37 susceptible to abundance concentrations that might otherwise be diluted by turbulence , convection and meridional circulation in the atmosphere .",
    "* deliyannis  ( 2002 ) ) suggested that the high li abundance could be explained by the theoretical diffusion models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* richer & michaud ( 1993 ) ) , as when internal mixing is insufficient to inhibit it , diffusion offers a viable mechanism for the li overabundance .",
    "these diffusion models specifically predict an overabundance of li in the very narrow @xmath2 range 6900 - 7100 k. in this @xmath2 range there is a substantial region below the extremely thin ( model ) surface convection zone where li atoms retain one electron , and below this region are completely ionised and diffuse downwards ( via gravitational settling and thermal diffusion ) relative to hydrogen .",
    "by contrast , the electron retaining li is radiatively accelerated upwards thus enriching the scz .",
    "it should be noted that subsequent improvements to these models ( ( * ? ? ? * richer  2000 ) ) results in them no longer showing a li peak , but the reasons for this are unclear .",
    "an alternative hypothesis comes in the form of accretion , with direct evidence for this process coming from either a correlation between metallicity and mass that could be explained in terms of decreasing cz mass onto which the accreted material is mixed , or a correlation between the abundance enhancements of various elements and either the abundances found in planetesimals or the condensation temperature of each element ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gonzalez  2001 ) ) .",
    "it was ( * ? ? ?",
    "* laws & gonzalez ( 2003 ) ) who drew on accretion as the cause of j37 s high li abundance and concluded that , though neither diffusion or accretion of either type is in complete agreement with j37 s abundance pattern the elements in the cz of j37 were set by the composition of a ) the primordial gas from the star s formation , b ) subsequent accretion of both depleted circumstellar gas and planetesimal material , and c ) evolution of its atmosphere through internal processes .    despite this ambiguity",
    "one can , in principal , distinguish between stars exhibiting the effects of diffusion or accretion by looking simultaneously at other elements , such as be , that burn at different temperatures or are stable in the stellar core .",
    "the li / be ratio is unlikely to be markedly changed by accretion processes , but because these are the lightest metals , they can behave in extreme and usually completely contrary ways , when subject to the effects of diffusion ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* turcotte  1998 ) ) .",
    "thanks to the specific predictions made about the behaviour of be abundances in the models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* richer  ( 2000 ) ) , the most striking of which being the excessive underabundance of be in super - li - rich dwarfs , the opposing diffusion / accretion predictions can be tested .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy was obtained for j37 and 9 other stars in ngc 6633 with the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) mounted on the ut2 8.2 m vlt telescope at cerro paranal , chile , on the night of 2003 june 12  13 .",
    "the standard dic1/346/580 template with a 1.2 arcsec slit was used with 2 @xmath6 2 and 1 @xmath6 1 binning on the blue and red arms of the instrument respectively .",
    "this provides the wavelength range 3050 ",
    "6820  ( orders 152  90 ) at a resolution of 35000 , with an exposure time of 3000 .",
    "the blue arm of uves was used to measure the be abundance while the red arm provided very high signal spectra allowing great improvements in the stellar atmospheric parameters ( particularly @xmath2 and microturbulence ) , by detailed consideration of many ( unblended ) lines of neutral / ionised fe and fitting the balmer line profiles .    due to problems with uves s automatic data reduction pipeline all the data reduction and extraction",
    "was carried out using the linux computing facilities at keele university and the echomop data reduction package .",
    "ccd frames were debiased , flat - fielded and sky - subtracted before the extraction of individual orders from the images .",
    "these extracted spectra were then wavelength calibrated using thorium - argon arc spectra taken on the same night .",
    "initial synthesis of the be line using the parameters of ( * ? ? ? * deliyannis  ( 2002 ) ) appears to favour the accretion hypothesis as mentioned in the introduction if diffusion is the correct solution for the li overabundance there should be a very low be abundance .",
    "an initial spectral synthesis of the be   doublet ( 3130.4   and 3131.1  ) region is shown in figure  [ fig : be ] , and the favoured result is currently @xmath0 = + 2.25 @xmath1 0.25 dex suggesting the be overabundance is almost as great at the li overabundance . however , though the studies of iron peak elements carried out by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* laws & gonzalez ( 2003 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* deliyannis  ( 2002 ) ) show overabundances in these elements it is not to such an extent as li and be suggesting diffusion may also be playing a role in increasing the abundance of these particular elements .",
    "the determination of a new set of atmospheric parameters started with the measurement of 44 unblended fe and fe ews between 4900 and 6800  using the gf - values held the code ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smith 1992 ) ) .",
    "ews were measured by direct integration below a continuum that was estimated by fitting a low - order polynomial to line free regions of the surrounding spectrum .",
    "initially working from the parameter set of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* deliyannis  ( 2002 ) ) this line list was used to determine [ fe / h ] via calculation of the mean abundance .",
    "the microturbulent velocity was then fixed by eliminating trends in fe abundance with expected equivalent width following the determination techniques of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* magain ( 1984 ) ) .",
    "these quantities were then use in the determination of @xmath2 and @xmath4 values by balancing the mean fe and fe abundances using the code .",
    "selections of parameter sets from along locus were then taken and these new sets synthesised , with new [ fe / h ] and microturbulence values calculated .",
    "this process was iterated ( focused on a constant @xmath4 value ) until the parameters settled . with several possible combinations of parameter sets possible ; and in theory infinite numbers in between , a plot of @xmath2 against @xmath4 was produced .",
    "the next stage , requiring the possible parameter sets to be limited , was to minimise the gradient via a least squares fit of excitation potential vs abundance with the fe line list .",
    "any gradient which fell within 1@xmath7 of a zero gradient was conservatively deemed a reasonable threshold , and thus restricted the available parameter sets .",
    "it should be noted at this stage that none of the techniques utilised so far incorporates stellar evolution theory , and to this end the geneva stellar evolution isochrones ( ( * ? ? ? * schaerer  1993 ) ) are incorporated at this stage .",
    "the [ fe / h ] for j37 is clearly super solar and thus z=0.040 isochrones were chosen ( the highest metallicity available ) , with no convective overshoot and standard mass loss at ages 600 - 700 my .",
    "the resulting parameter range for j37 is marked in figure  [ fig : parameters ] as dictated by these three analysis techniques . from this first analysis the parameters are believed to be , @xmath2 @xmath3 7340 k , @xmath4 @xmath3 4.1 , microturbulence @xmath3 4.3  @xmath5 and [ fe / h ] @xmath3 0.50 .",
    "these initial parameters agree well with the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* laws & gonzalez ( 2003 ) ) and moves j37 off the predicted li peak as predicted by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* richer & michaud ( 1993 ) ) .",
    "therefore , this also provides evidence for the accretion process as the cause of j37s high li abundance ."
