    "sets of positive reach were introduced by federer in @xcite .",
    "this class of sets can be viewed as an extension of that of convex sets .",
    "it is well known that every point @xmath19 external to a closed convex set @xmath20 in @xmath0 admits a unique _ projection _ on @xmath20 , i.e. a point which minimizes the distance from @xmath19 among all points in @xmath20 .",
    "sets of positive reach are those for which the projection is unique for the points of a parallel neighborhood of the set ( and not necessarily for all external points ) .    along with their definition ,",
    "federer provided the main fundamental properties of sets of positive reach .",
    "namely , the validity of global and local steiner formulas and consequently the existence of curvature measures and many relevant properties of such measures .",
    "the study of properties of sets with positive reach has been continued by several authors and along various directions .",
    "let us mention the contributions given by zhle @xcite and rataj and zhle @xcite on integral representation of curvature measures , the results by hug @xcite , and hug and the first author @xcite on singular points of sets with positive reach and the extensions of steiner type formulas by hug , last and weil @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite fu proved several interesting connections between sets of positive reach and semi - convex functions .",
    "as stated by federer , closed convex sets represent a limit case of sets of positive reach , as the reach tends to @xmath21 .",
    "the following question was at the origin of the research carried out in this paper .",
    "is it possible to see ( at least some of ) the geometric properties of convex sets as limit case of suitable geometric properties of sets of positive reach ?",
    "the first property that we analyse is the very definition of convex set : if @xmath1 and @xmath2 belong to a convex set @xmath20 , then the segment joining them is entirely contained in @xmath20 . in ",
    "3 we prove a possible counterpart of this fact for sets of positive reach .",
    "for two points @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xmath0 and @xmath3 we denote by @xmath4 the intersection of all closed balls of radius @xmath5 containing @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the set @xmath4 is a rugby ball - shaped set with cusps in @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; moreover for @xmath22 , @xmath4 tends to the segment with endpoints @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "theorem [ t2.1 ] states that @xmath6 if and only if for every @xmath7 such that @xmath8 , @xmath9 is connected .",
    "the proof of this result is geometric and does not require sophisticated techniques . as a corollary ( see theorem [ t2.2 ] ) we have the following fact : if @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a closed ball of radius less than or equal to @xmath5 , intersecting @xmath12 , then @xmath13 . the latter property can be seen as a counterpart , for sets with positive reach , of the well - known fact that the intersection of a convex set with an half - space is convex ( if it is non - empty ) .",
    "next , we consider the following problem : given a set @xmath15 and a number @xmath3 is it possible to find the minimal set ( with respect to inclusion ) containing @xmath15 and having reach greater than or equal to @xmath5 ?",
    "the corresponding problem in the context of convexity ( @xmath23 ) has an affirmative answer : every set admits a least convex cover , i.e. its convex hull .",
    "we will see through simple examples that this is not the case for arbitrary @xmath15 and @xmath5 and we will find necessary and sufficient conditions so that @xmath15 admits a minimal cover of reach greater than or equal to @xmath5 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 we introduce some notations ; in  3 we prove theorem [ t2.1 ] and some related results ; in  4 we deal with the least cover with prescribed reach of a given set .",
    "let @xmath0 be the @xmath24-dimensional euclidean space ; for @xmath25 , let @xmath26 be their distance and let @xmath27 denote the usual scalar product .",
    "if @xmath15 is a subset of @xmath0 , then @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 will denote the interior , the closure and the complement set of @xmath15 , respectively . for @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "we set @xmath33 for @xmath14 and @xmath34 , the distance of @xmath35 from @xmath15 is given by @xmath36    let us recall the definition of _ sets of positive reach _ , introduced in @xcite .",
