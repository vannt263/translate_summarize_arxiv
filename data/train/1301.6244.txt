    "this fragmented structure of solar flares indicates that a flare is an ensemble of a vast amount of small scale energy release .",

    "karlick et al .",
    "( 2000 ) examined twelve flares , and showed that microwave spikes seen in each flare show power - law features in size and time scales ( i.e. scale of energy release ) .",
    "in addition , the occurrence of microflares and x - ray bright points is known to follow power - law distributions @xcite .",
    "recent development in magnetic reconnection theory also indicates that magnetic reconnection proceeds intermittently , involving repeated formation of magnetic islands and their subsequence coalescence @xcite .",
    "this process is known as the `` impulsive bursty '' regime of magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "as shibata @xmath3 tanuma ( 2001 ) showed , plasmoids of various scales are generated in the current sheet in a fractal manner .",
    "such fractal nature of magnetic reconnection might generate power - law characteristics that are observed in solar flares , as mentioned above .",
    "karlick et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and kliem et al .",
    "( 2000 ) discussed similar features seen in the hxr and microwave emissions , based on the theoretical view of dynamic magnetic reconnection .",
    "although the temporal resolutions of hxr and microwave observations were high enough to reveal fragmented features in the temporal scale , the time variability of flare kernels has not been discussed with two - dimensional images with high spatial and temporal resolutions .    historically , the two ribbon structure has been observed in h@xmath2 and other wavelengths in solar flares .",
    "flare kernels inside the ribbons are well correlated with hxr and microwave emissions temporally and spatially in h@xmath2 @xcite . also in ultraviolets ( uvs ) , such as in 1550  taken with trace the same properties were observed @xcite , indicating that sudden plasma heating occurs in the upper chromosphere and the transition region by nonthermal particles or thermal conduction . hence h@xmath2 kernels and trace 1550  ( @xmath0 doublet emissions ) kernels can also be good tracers of hxr sources .    in this paper , we examine the fine structures inside the flare ribbons seen in the uv images of the x2.5 flare that occurred on 2004 november 10 .",
    "we show the fragmented features of the bright emission sources , and that they follow a power - law distribution just in a single event .",
    "finally we discuss the fractal features of energy release region ( i.e. current sheet ) and the avalanching system of the flare to explain such fragmented structures .",
    "the large flare ( x2.5 in goes class ) occurred in the noaa active region 10696 ( n08@xmath5 , w50@xmath5 ) at 02:00 ut , 2004 november 10 .",
    "this flare was a long duration event that showed a typical two ribbon structure preceded by a filament eruption .",
    "the erupted filament showed a kinking structure @xcite , and a lot of attention has been paid to it because this is a candidate for the source of the geo - effective coronal mass ejection ( cme ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we observed the flare with the sartorius 18 cm refractor telescope at kwasan observatory , kyoto university @xcite .",
    "the highest temporal and spatial resolutions of the sartorius data are 1 @xmath6 and 1.2 , respectively .",
    "figures 1(a)-1(c ) shows the images of the flare in h@xmath2 at 02:06 , 02:08 , and 02:10 ut , which correspond to the peak times of the hxr emission ( see also figure 2 ) .",
    "we can see some h@xmath2 flare kernels inside the ribbon structure .",
    "the uv images were taken by 1600  passband of trace as shown in figures 1(d)-1(f ) .",
    "they also show a two - ribbon structure .",
    "the trace 1600  data was obtained with the temporal and the spatial resolutions of 3 @xmath6 and 0.5  . during flares , the pair of @xmath0 doublet ( @xmath11550 ) in a broad response of the 1600  passband is strongly enhanced @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 formation temperature is about 10@xmath7 k. therefore , the bright features in figures 1(d)-1(f ) observed in the impulsive phase are probably caused by the enhancement of the @xmath0 ( @xmath11550 ) emission line due to transition region heating .",
    "we call the bright features @xmath0 kernels .",
    "we overlaid hxr contour images ( 25 - 50 kev ) on trace 1600  images to compare the spatial distribution of radiation sources in h@xmath2 and hxr emissions ( see figures 1(d)-1(f ) ) .",
    "the hxr images were taken with rhessi .",
    "we synthesized the hxr image with the clean algorithm , which is the same method as is commonly used for analysis of radio data , and grids 3 - 9 , which give the spatial resolution ( fwhm ) of about 10  .",
    "the integration time is set to be 60 @xmath6 , and the total photon count was 3.8 - 7.7@xmath810@xmath9 counts for photons of 25 - 50 kev .",
    "these synthesizing tools are included in the solar software .",
    "we found that the hxr sources are associated with both h@xmath2 and @xmath0 kernels .",
    "the location of the hxr sources moves in the southeast direction as the flare progresses , that is , from a mixed polarity region to a strong magnetic field region , indicating a change in the site of the strong energy release . though the kernels are seen in the southeast of the h@xmath2 and trace images from 2:05 - 2:08 i.e. before the hxr sources have arrived there ,",
    "this is probably because the hxr emissions are not large enough to be observed with the dynamic range of rhessi .",
    "actually small flare kernels in the southeast of figure 1(d ) at around 02:06 ut , which are the components of the ribbons , show small peaks of intensity less than 25 percent of the later impulsive burst at 02:10 ut , as well as in the h@xmath2 time profile ( see figure 2(b ) ) .",
    "we summarize the results of the comparison of the multi - wavelength observations in h@xmath2 , @xmath0 ( @xmath11550 ) and hxr emissions as follows : ( i ) there are not only good spatial but also temporal correlations among flare kernels observed in h@xmath2 and @xmath0 emissions , some of which are associated with the hxr emission .",
    "this implies that the @xmath0 and h@xmath2 kernels are caused by nonthermal electrons interacting with the ambient thick target plasma as well as hxrs .",
    "( ii ) the @xmath0 flare ribbons are much thinner and sharper than the h@xmath2 ribbons .",
    "this is because the width of flare ribbons is typically determined by cooling time via thermal conduction and radiative cooling , and because thermal conduction time scale in the corona / transition region for @xmath0 is much shorter than that for h@xmath2 in the chromosphere .",
    "the ratio of the peak intensity of the h@xmath2 kernels to the background is not very large , as a result , the integrated h@xmath2 emission over the whole active region is similar to the soft x - ray emission ( see figure 2(b ) ) . on the other hand , the integrated @xmath0 emission is still similar to the hxr emission , showing corresponding peaks in their time profiles .",
    "as a result of the comparison of the multi - wavelength observations , we found that it is easier to identify peaks in the time profile of the @xmath0 emission , rather than in h@xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the seeing condition smeared the h@xmath2 images in the impulsive phase , and therefore we focused on the temporal variations of the @xmath0 flare kernels here .",
    "we measured the intensity , duration and time interval between each peak from the time profiles .",
    "we divided both flare ribbons into fine meshes .",
    "each mesh box is a square with size of 5  , 2  and 1  for comparison . although this is larger than the elemental h@xmath2 kernels , which are considered to be about 1  or even smaller @xcite , it is small enough for us to determine the essential structures inside the flare ribbons .",
    "next we examined time variations of the total intensity for each box in the meshes .",
    "as the mesh size becomes smaller and smaller , peaks in the time profile become isolated .",
    "this means that the light curves with a large ( 5  ) mesh possibly contain multiple flare kernels that are superposed over each other , while smaller size mesh can cover only single flare kernel .",
    "we found that a 2  mesh is enough to isolate most of the superposed peaks , though some peaks can not be separated even with a 1  mesh .",
    "this implies that the size of the heating source is comparable to or smaller than 2  .",
    "since a 1  mesh is too small and too noisy to analyze , we adopted a 5  and a 2  size mesh for our further analysis .",
    "we defined the maximum intensity of a light curve as the peak intensity ( @xmath10 ) , and determined the duration ( @xmath11 ) as the full width at the three fourths maximum intensity of each peak because not all of the peak durations can be measured with the full width at the half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "we identified 586 @xmath0 kernels using a 5  mesh in the impulsive phase , only with the requirement that the count rate of the detector exceeds 50 counts s@xmath12 to identify the peaks .",
    "figure 3(a ) , 3(b ) shows the frequency distributions of the peak intensity and the duration of each peak .",
    "we also recorded the peak time of the flare kernels across the whole active region .",
    "we determined the time interval of the peaks ( @xmath13 ) as the time difference between the peak times and show its frequency distribution in figure 3(c ) .",
    "the distribution of peak intensities , durations and time intervals reveal power - laws during the impulsive phase . from the slopes of the distribution ,",
    "we obtain a power - law indices @xmath2 @xmath11.5 for the peak intensity , @xmath2 @xmath12.3 for the peak duration , and @xmath2 @xmath11.8 for the time interval between each peak . the lower limit of time duration of about 10 @xmath6 comes from the temporal resolution of trace such as 2 - 3 @xmath6 in a flare mode .",
    "when we change the mesh size from 5  to 2  , each peak became isolated and sharpened so that the number of the peaks with short duration increased .",
    "we found that the distributions of the peak intensity , duration and time interval well followed power - law distributions with the power - law indices of @xmath2 @xmath11.5 , 2.3 and 1.8 , respectively .",
    "these power - law indices remain unchanged , even if we change the size of the mesh box from 5  to 2  , and even if we change the threshold of the peak identification . in this individual event",
    ", we showed for the first time , the power - law behavior of flare kernels typically seen in studies of large numbers of flares , suggestive of a link between the observations and theoretical modeling of the fractal nature of magnetic reconnection in current sheets . if magnetic reconnection occurs in a fractal manner in the current sheet , one would expect energy release and particle heating / acceleration on a range of different sizes and time scales , such that power - law distributions could be expected in the size , duration , etc . of tracers of the energy release process .",
    "since flare kernels have been shown to be good proxies for the hxr energy release and , furthermore , trace @xmath0 kernels can also be good tracers of hxr sources , one would expect to see such behavior in their properties .",
    "in fact , the peak intensity and peak duration could be indicators of the released energy .",
    "the peak time also corresponds to the timing when heating of the foot point plasma occurs , that is the arrival time of released energy at the foot point .",
    "the duration of the transition region heating @xmath11 and the time interval @xmath13 are roughly characterized by alfvn time @xmath14 of the reconnection region , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a characteristic length of the energy release region ( e.g. macroscopic length of a current sheet or plasmoid ) , @xmath17 is an alfvn velocity ( @xmath18 @xmath19 ) , and @xmath19 is a typical magnetic field strength in the corona . on the other hand , intensity of flare kernels @xmath10",
    "is estimated as , @xmath20 so , if magnetic reconnection occurs in a fractal manner in the current sheet through the repeated formations of magnetic islands and their subsequence coalescence , current sheets become thinner and thinner and as a result , the self - similar structure of current sheet can be formed from macroscopic to microscopic scales . at that time",
    ", the size of energy release region @xmath16 can be expected to exhibit power - law behavior , so that power - law distributions can be expected in the energy , duration , etc . of tracers of the energy release process , such as @xmath10 and @xmath14 .",
    "these fractal structures mean that there are no characteristic scales of length , energy and time in the energy release process .",
    "our results also support the view of the impulsive bursty reconnection @xcite and the fractal features of the current sheet @xcite . a power - law distribution for magnetic energy of plasmoid is also reported in the magnetosphere by hoshino et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . on the basis of the unified view suggested by shibata ( 1999 ) as the plasmoid - induced - reconnection model ,",
    "plasmoid ejection plays a crucial role for energy storage and release , driving the inflow and the reconnection rate enhancement . on a large scale ,",
    "the flare itself should exhibit these properties .",
    "our results are quite similar to the power - law behaviors typically seen in studies of large numbers of flares ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are often interpreted as evidence of an avalanching system of self - organized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "this suggests that the elemental energy release in this individual event may be similar to that in a typical x - ray flare and hence interpreted as an avalanching system of soc in a single event or by fractal current sheet in the impulsive reconnection region as discussed above .",
