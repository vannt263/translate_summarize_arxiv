    "an essential part of the motion of short - lived nucleonic matter is in classically forbidden regions and , hence , its properties are effected by both the continuum and many - body correlations @xcite .",
    "the effect of resonances and the non - resonant scattering states can be considered in the oqs extension of the shell model ( sm ) , the so - called continuum shell model ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "two realizations of the csm have been studied recently : the real - energy csm @xcite and the complex - energy csm @xcite , the so - called gamow shell model ( gsm ) . for hermitian hamilton operators , both real - energy csm and complex - energy csm ( gsm ) lead to the complex - symmetric , non - hermitian eigenvalue problem . as a result , oqss exhibit unintuitive properties , qualitatively different from closed quantum systems ( cqss ) .",
    "one of them is the phenomenon of sharp crossing of resonances with same quantum numbers ( same symmetries ) . among degeneracies associated with avoided crossings in quantal spectra ,",
    "one finds a diabolic point ( dp ) @xcite , and an exceptional point ( ep ) @xcite , which appears in complex extended hermitian hamiltonians . in this letter",
    ", we shall discuss some aspects of degeneracies in spectra of a prototypical oqs , the 3-level richardson - gaudin ( rg ) model .",
    "rg models @xcite are based on the @xmath0 algebra with elements @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , fulfilling the commutation relations : @xmath4=\\delta_{ll^{\\prime } } k^0_l~$ ] , @xmath5=\\pm\\delta_{ll^{\\prime } } k^{\\pm}_l~$ ] , where indices @xmath6 refer to a particular copy from a set of @xmath7 , @xmath0 algebras . in the following , we shall use the pair representation of su(2 ) algebra .",
    "the elementary operators in this representation are the number operators @xmath8 and the pair operators @xmath9 , @xmath10 , defined as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total angular momentum and @xmath13 is the @xmath14-projection .",
    "the state @xmath15 is the time reversal of @xmath16 .",
    "the relation between the operators of the pair algebra and the generators of the su(2 ) algebra is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the particle degeneracy of level @xmath19 . with this correspondence",
    ", one can introduce the non - integrable 3-level pairing hamiltonian : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a @xmath22-number and coupling constants @xmath23 , @xmath24 are complex . for @xmath25 ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ niph ] ) is integrable .",
    "in the following , we shall analyze solutions of the 3-level non - integrable pairing model ( [ niph ] ) in the case of 2 pairs of fermions in a valence space of degeneracy @xmath34 .",
    "energies of levels are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . in this model space , there are @xmath38 many - body states , and the total number of roots of @xmath29 is @xmath39 .",
    "the 3-level pairing model is reflection symmetric with respect to the real @xmath23-axis ( @xmath40 ) . in the lower half - plane , all eigenvalues are either discrete states at @xmath41 or decaying resonances .",
    "complex conjugate states are situated in the upper half - plane ( @xmath42 ) and correspond to capturing resonances .",
    "[ fig23 ] shows a pattern associated with the formation / breakup of the pseudo - dp at @xmath43 , _",
    "i.e. _ in the non - hermitian limit of the model ( [ niph ] ) . with an increasing value of @xmath44 ,",
    "the two eps in the complex @xmath23-plane approach each other , coalesce at @xmath45 and move along the axis @xmath41 for @xmath46 . at @xmath43 for @xmath45 ,",
    "real parts of all eigenenergies are identical .",
    "[ fig24 ] shows a real part of the phase along the trajectory in @xmath23-plane surrounding the pseudo - dp , for all eigenvectors in the chosen model space .",
    "the phase of each vector is defined with respect of its value at @xmath47 .",
    "the trajectory is defined by : @xmath48 .",
    "the ( complex ) eigenvalues for vectors 2 and 3 are degenerate at the pseudo - dp and change their phase by @xmath49 at each encircling , as expected for an ordinary dp .",
    "however , in contrast to the ordinary dp , both eigenvalues _ and _ eigenvectors merge forming a jordan block , like for an ordinary ep .",
    "nevertheless , the crossing of eigenvalues is sharp as in the case of ordinary level crossing or the dp .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig24 ] that phases of vectors 1 and 4 , which have different imaginary parts of eigenvalues , remain approximately constant .",
    "the complex behavior of eigenvalues in the neighborhood of a pseudo - dp in complex @xmath23-plane are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig25 ] along the cut @xmath50 . in the lower part",
    ", one can see the appearance of a pseudo - dp at @xmath51 as a crossing of imaginary parts of eigenvalues 2 and 3. at @xmath52 , real parts of all eigenvalues are equal ( see the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig25 ] ) .",
    "notice at @xmath53 , close to the pseudo - dp , a formation of an ep by eigenvalues 1 and 3.",
    "in contrast to a cqs ( a hermitian system ) , the _ exact _ degeneracies of eigenvalues for states of the same quantum numbers ( symmetries ) are allowed in an oqs .",
    "such degeneracies ( ep , dp , pseudo - dp ) are closely related to topological anomalies of the hilbert space @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we have demonstrated the formation of a pseudo - dp in the anti - hermitian limit of a 3-level pairing hamiltonian .",
    "it remains to be seen in future studies using the csm and realistic two - body interactions whether those anomalies can have observable consequences in resonance spectroscopy and low - energy nuclear reactions .",
