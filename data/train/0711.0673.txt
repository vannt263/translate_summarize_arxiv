    "recently , rindler and ishak @xcite have corrected a long - standing error in the literature concerning the cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) and the bending of light for a single source , an error perpetuated by the author @xcite . here",
    "i reexamine the classic subject of the bending of light ( with a concentration on a solar mass deflector - not gravitational lensing in general ) and arrive at some further results which should be of wide - spread interest .",
    "the background geometry is the spherical vacuum given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and we restrict our analysis to @xmath4 .",
    "the non - radial null geodesic equation associated with ( [ line ] ) given ( [ factor ] ) can be written in the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and the maximal value of @xmath7 is assumed fixed and given by @xmath8 irrespective of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ u3 ] ) is solved exactly , up to sign , by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 so that @xmath14 and @xmath15 the function @xmath16 is given by @xcite @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind of purely imaginary modulus @xcite .",
    "the solution ( [ solution ] ) is shown in figure [ trajectory ] .",
    "note that there is an apse at @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath24 we have @xmath25 along the orbit , @xmath26 is distinguished by the condition @xmath27 table [ table1 ] gives a numerical summary for grazing incidence with the sun based on ( accurate ) numerical approximation to the exact solution ( [ solution ] ) .",

    "if @xmath30 then from ( [ solution ] ) it follows that @xmath31 if @xmath32 we can take a taylor series of @xmath33 about @xmath34 which gives    @xmath35    and it is a trivial matter to go to higher orders .",
    "the first six terms in ( [ taylor ] ) have been given previously @xcite .",
    "in many applications the first term alone represents an adequate approximation .",
    "from ( [ factor ] ) and ( [ chicalc ] ) it follows that @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath7 corresponds to the observer .",
    "equation ( [ newchi ] ) is exact .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath39 so that @xmath40 and further , let us suppose that for the observer @xmath41 , so that @xmath42 then ( [ newchi ] ) takes the form @xmath43 if @xmath44 we arrive at the obvious result @xmath45 if @xmath46 let us assume that @xmath47 that is , @xmath48 . then , for the cosmological horizon @xmath49 , we obtain @xcite @xmath50 so that we can rewrite ( [ newchilim ] ) in the form @xmath51 under the assumption @xmath52 , that is @xmath53 we again obtain the now somewhat less obvious result ( [ newchilim0 ] ) .    to gauge the effect of @xmath1 consider @xmath54 which reduces to @xmath55 putting this into a crude cosmological context , let us take the following fiducial values : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 in units of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 in units of 100 kpc , and @xmath62 , @xmath63 in units of gpc . here",

    "now ( [ sigmalimit ] ) requires @xmath65 , and ( [ ulimit ] ) requires @xmath66 . for ( [ lamdalimit ] )",
    "we require @xmath67 and for ( [ horizon ] ) @xmath68 .",
    "relation ( [ newchilimlambda ] ) should therefore be a reasonable approximation in this context .",
    "note that we can not set @xmath69 as this would require @xmath70 .",
    "gathering this all together , we have the following approximation , @xmath71 where the last term assumes @xmath72 . for unit values of @xmath73 and @xmath63 then @xmath74 which , in principle , is a measurable difference .",
    "however , since we can not set @xmath69 , the cosmological context has to be refined @xcite .",
    "if we start with the assumption @xmath76 , where @xmath77 corresponds to the observer , then @xmath78 and we again obtain @xmath79 and also @xmath80 so that @xmath81 as one finds in most texts",
    ". however , the approximation ( [ bogus ] ) is inadequate .",
    "rather , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 to the 6 figure accuracy reported in this paper we find @xmath84 this  explains \" the almost perfect cancelation of the two terms on the left and the remarkable accuracy of the shapiro - ward formula ( [ shward ] ) .",

    "<S> recently , rindler and ishak have argued that the bending of light is , in principle , changed by the presence of a cosmological constant since one must consider not only the null geodesic equation , but also the process of measurement . </S>",
    "<S> i agree with the fact that both must be considered . here , on the basis of the mathematically exact solution to the classical bending problem , and independent of the cosmological constant , i clarify the approximate argument found in the vast majority of texts ( new and old ) for the measured value of the bending of light for a single source and show that the result is in part due to the almost perfect cancelation of two terms , one of which is seldom considered . </S>",
    "<S> when one considers two sources , this cancelation is of no consequence , and , for example , if the sources are opposite with the same associated apsidal distance , the approximate argument gives the rigorously correct answer ( up to numerical evaluation ) , an answer which is unaffected by the presence of a cosmological constant .    </S>"
