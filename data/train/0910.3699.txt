    "the behavior of ultracold superfluid fermi gases continues to attract attention from the experimental and theoretical communities . through a feshbach resonance @xcite which tunes the strength of the attractive interaction",
    ", these trapped gases can exhibit a crossover from bcs to bose einstein condensation ( bec ) . unlike the bose superfluids , at the time of their discovery ,",
    "the fermi superfluids are not associated with any ready - made theory ( such as gross pitaevskii , or bogoliubov theory for bosons ) .",
    "this provides an opportunity for theorists to work hand in hand with experimentalists to arrive at the same level of understanding of the fermionic as was reached for the bosonic superfluids .",
    "while the fermi systems are harder to address than the bose counterparts , the payoff for progress is great .",
    "moreover , there is a general belief that these systems may lead to important insights into high temperature superconductor ( htscs ) , in part because the htscs exhibit an anomalously short coherence length which suggests that they may be mid - way between bcs and bec @xcite .",
    "there is , as yet , no clear consensus about the theory which underlies bcs - bec crossover although there are three rather well studied analytic many body theories which have emerged .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to present a comparison and assessment of these approaches with a particular focus on the two of the three , which seem most reliable .",
    "in addition to assessing the theoretical approaches , we address physical consequences and how the theories may be differentiated through the behavior of the centrally important spectral function and related density of states .",
    "we do this in the context of radio - frequency-(rf ) based probes .",
    "what is among the most interesting features of bcs - bec crossover is the fact that the normal state ( out of which superfluidity forms ) is different from the normal state ( fermi liquid ) associated with strict bcs theory .",
    "the normal state of , for example , a unitary gas consists of pre - formed pairs which persist below @xmath2 in the form of non - condensed pair excitations of the condensate .",
    "this excitation branch is in addition to the usual gapped fermionic excitations .",
    "the normal state is often said to exhibit a  pseudogap \" which has features in common with the exotic normal state of the high temperature superconductors .",
    "this pseudogap @xcite reflects the formation of quasi - bound pairs which in turn require an energy input ( called @xmath3 ) in order to break the pairs and create fermionic excitations .",
    "physically , what differs from one crossover theory to another @xcite is the nature of these non - condensed or pre - formed pairs which , respectively , appear below and above @xmath2 . unlike the pair fluctuations of traditional superconductors ( which are associated with low dimensionality and impurity effects ) these pairs are present because of a stronger - than - bcs attractive interaction . as a consequence , the pairing gap @xmath3 persists to temperatures which can be several times @xmath2 for the case of the unitary gases .    in this paper",
    "we address the temperature dependence of the spectral function particularly in the normal state",
    ". the density of states ( dos ) , which can be obtained from the spectral function , will also be presented .",
    "we compare with experiments in the context of rf spectra of both unpolarized and polarized fermi gases .",
    "quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite provide useful information such as the superfluid transition temperature @xmath2 , entropy , condensate fraction , etc . and",
    "recently reveal evidence of non - condensed pairs @xcite along with a pseudogap @xcite in the normal phase .",
    "our focus is on two different finite - temperature bcs - bec crossover theories and we present a detailed comparison of the results obtained from the two theories as well as an assessment of other bcs - bec crossover theories .      a fair amount of controversy @xcite has surfaced in the literature regarding the three alternative analytic pairing fluctuation schemes . in this paper",
    "we address some of these issues and clarify misleading claims . at this early stage of understanding",
    "we do not believe it is suitable to invoke ( possibly fortuitous ) fits to particular experimental or monte - carlo derived numbers to establish which of these theories is  best \" . rather in line with the goal of this paper",
    ", one has to look at the differences at a more general level .",
    "one has , furthermore , to subject these theories to careful consistency tests .",
    "each of the three many body approaches is associated with a different ground state .",
    "thus far , only one of these can be written down analytically . in this context",
    "we note that one can trace the historical origin of the bcs - bec literature to the observation that the simplest bcs - like wavefunction @xmath4 is much more general than originally presumed @xcite . to implement this generalization ,",
    "all that is required is that one solve for the two variational parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 in concert with a self consistent condition on the fermionic chemical potential @xmath7 .",
    "as the attraction is increased , @xmath7 becomes different from the fermi energy @xmath8 , and in particular , in the bec regime , @xmath7 is negative .",
    "this ground state is often called the  bcs - leggett \" state and the two variational parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be converted to two more physically accessible parameters associated with the zero temperature gap ( or equivalently order parameter ) and @xmath7 .",
    "the three theories currently of interest can be related to a t - matrix scheme . within a given t - matrix scheme one",
    "treats the fermionic self energy and the pair - propagator using a coupled equation scheme , but drops the contributions from higher order green s functions .",
    "this t - matrix is called @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a four - vector and @xmath11 denotes the boson matsubara frequency ; it characterizes the non - condensed pairs which are described physically and formally in different ways in the different theories .",
    "here the subscript @xmath12 is associated with the pseudogap ( pg ) whose presence is dependent on the non - condensed or pre - formed pairs .",
    "quite generally we can write the t - matrix in a ladder - diagram series as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the pair susceptibility and @xmath15 denotes the attractive coupling constant .",
    "the nozires - schmitt - rink ( nsr ) theory @xcite is associated with a pair susceptibility @xmath14 which is a product of two bare green s functions .",
    "the fluctuation exchange or flex approach is associated with two dressed green s functions and has been discussed by haussmann @xcite , zwerger and their collaborators in the context of the cold gases , and even earlier in the context of the cuprates @xcite .",
    "it is also called the luttinger - ward formalism @xcite , or galitskii - feynman theory @xcite .",
    "finally , it is well known @xcite that bcs theory ( and now its bcs - bec generalization ) is associated with one bare and one dressed green s function in the pair susceptibility .",
    "these differences would seem to be rather innocuous and technical but they have led to significant qualitative differences and concurrently strong claims by various proponents .",
    "we stress that while there are several variants , as we discuss below , the version of the nsr scheme which seems to us most free of concerns is that discussed in references  @xcite which introduced a more physical treatment of the number equation .",
    "this revision of strict nsr theory was , in part , an answer to j. serene @xcite who raised a question about a central approximation in the theory in which the number equation ( @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the single particle green s function ) is approximated by @xmath18 , where the thermodynamical potential @xmath19 is approximated by a ladder - diagram series .",
    "it was shown that this amounts to taking the leading order in a dyson series for @xmath17 .",
    "the present paper concentrates on the normal state behavior , although all three classes of theories have been extended below @xmath2 .",
    "what is essential about these extensions is that the non - condensed pair excitations associated with @xmath20 are gapless , as in boson theories .",
    "indeed , it is in these @xmath21 extensions that a number of concerns have been raised . in particular , in the leading order extended nsr theory ( or so called  bogoliubov level \" approach ) , @xcite , the gap equation ( which is assumed to take the usual bcs form , rather than derived , for example , variationally ) does not contain explicit pairing fluctuation contributions ; these enter indirectly only via the fermion chemical potential @xmath7 . at this level ,",
    "the number equation is the only way in which explicit pairing fluctuations are incorporated . at the so called  popov level \" calculation",
    ", the gap equation is presumed to contain pair fluctuations @xcite but there is some complexity in ensuring the concomitant gaplessness of the pair excitations .",
    "similar issues arise with the flex or luttinger - ward approach in which ( @xcite and references therein ) gapless sound modes must be imposed somewhat artificially .",
    "while the order of the transition at @xmath2 is second order in the bcs - leggett scheme it is first order @xcite in nsr based approaches ( as well as for the fully renormalized pair susceptibility scheme .",
    "this leads to unwanted features in the density profiles @xcite and @xmath0 dependent superfluid density @xcite , @xmath22 . despite these unphysical aspects ,",
    "the nsr - based scheme captures the physics of bogoliubov theory of weakly interacting bosons @xcite and should , in principle , be the quantitatively better low @xmath0 state , particularly in the bec limit .",
    "nevertheless some issues have been identified @xcite which suggest the breakdown of true quasi - particles associated with bogoliubov - like theories for paired fermions .",
    "this , in turn , derives from the self consistent treatment of coupling between the non - condensed pairs and the sound modes .",
    "further analysis will be required to establish if this is compatible with experimental or theoretical constraints .",
    "a very early concern about the so - called  gg \" or flex approach was raised in a paper by kadanoff and martin @xcite in 1961 :  the similarity [ to a bethe - salpeter equation ] has led several people to surmise that the symmetrical equation [ involving fully dressed g s everywhere ] solved in the same approximation would be more accurate .",
    "this surmise is not correct .",
    "the green s functions resulting from that equation can be rejected in favor of those used by bcs by means of a variational principle . \"",
    "importantly this approach does not have a true pseudogap .",
    "despite claims by the zwerger group @xcite that theirs is a more fully  consistent \" theory , and in this context appealing to ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite instead say :  we thus conclude that ... approaches such as flex are unreliable in the absence of a migdal theorem and that there is indeed a pseudogap . \"",
    "similar observations have appeared elsewhere in the literature @xcite . as noted in ref .",
    "vertex corrections to the self energy , which are discarded in the previous studies [ of flex ] are crucially important for the pseudogap \" .",
    "additional concerns have been noted recently @xcite that in the flex ( or @xmath23 t - matrix ) theory the propagator @xmath24 does not display quasiparticle poles associated with the gap .",
    "`` this is because the dyson equation , @xmath25 , excludes identical poles of @xmath24 and @xmath26 while the linear relation demands them '' .    in recent work below",
    "@xmath2 @xcite a non - variational gap equation was used to derive an additional term in the number equation related to @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the order parameter and , here , again , @xmath19 is the thermodynamical potential .",
    "this extra term means there is no variational free energy functional , such as required by landau - ginsburg theory . of concern",
    "are arguments that by including @xmath29 , it is possible to capture the results of petrov et al @xcite for the inter - boson scattering length .",
    "we see no physical connection between the exact four - fermion calculations and the non - variational component of the many body gap equation .",
    "it should , moreover , be stressed that all other t - matrix schemes have reported an effective pair - pair scattering length given by @xmath30 which is larger than the value @xmath31 obtained from a four - body problem @xcite .",
    "here @xmath32 is the @xmath33-wave scattering length of fermions . indeed , our past work @xcite and that of reference @xcite have shown that one needs to go beyond the simple t - matrix theory to accommodate these four - fermion processes .",
    "additional concerns arise from the fact that an nsr - based scheme has difficulty @xcite accommodating polarization effects in the unitary regime . as stated by the co - workers in reference @xcite :",
    " unfortunately , in a region around the unitary limit we find that the nsr approach generally leads to a negative population imbalance at a positive chemical potential difference implying an unphysical compressibility . \" .",
    "the central weakness of the bcs - leggett approach ( and its finite-@xmath0 extension ) appears to be the fact it focuses principally on the pairing channel and is not readily able to incorporate hartree effects .",
    "the evident simplicity of this ground state has raised concern as well .",
    "clearly , this is by no means the only ground state to consider but , among all alternatives , it has been the most widely applied by the cold gas community including the following notable papers @xcite .",
    "the central strengths of the finite-@xmath0 extended bcs - leggett approach in comparison with others are that ( i ) there are no spurious first order transitions and ( ii ) the entire range of temperatures is accessible .",
    "( iii ) moreover , polarization effects may be readily included @xcite , ( iv ) as may inhomogeneities which are generally treated using bogoliubov degennes theory @xcite , based on this ground state .",
    "the above analysis leaves us with two theoretical schemes which we wish to further explore : the nsr approach ( which in the normal phase follows directly from the original paper @xcite ) and the bcs - leggett - based scheme , as extended away from zero temperature , and in particular above @xmath2 . as t - matrix approaches to many body theory , these are similar in spirit , but different in implementation .",
    "it is clearest below @xmath2 , that the two theories focus on different physics .",
    "nsr approaches view the dominant processes as the coupling of the order parameter collective modes to the non - condensed pairs and the bcs - leggett scheme focuses on the steady state equilibrium between the gapped fermions and the non - condensed pairs .",
    "thus nsr focuses more fully on the bosonic degrees of freedom and bcs - leggett focuses on the fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "above @xmath2 , because the nsr scheme involves only bare green s functions , it is simpler . thus , it has been studied at a numerical level in a more systematic fashion . in the literature ,",
    "the bcs - leggett approach at @xmath34 , has been addressed numerically @xcite , assessed more theoretically @xcite , as well as applied to different physical contexts @xcite . in this paper",
    "we apply an approximation based on prior numerical work @xcite to simplify the calculations .",
    "a central way of characterizing these different bcs - bec crossover theories is through the behavior of the fermionic spectral function , @xmath35 . for the most part , here",
    ", we restrict our consideration to the normal state where @xmath35 should indicate the presence or not of a pseudogap . a momentum integrated form of the spectral function is reflected in radio frequency studies both tomographic @xcite or effectively homogeneous and trap averaged @xcite .",
    "one of the principal observations of this paper is that these momentum integrated probes are not , in general , sufficiently sensitive to pick up more than gross differences between the three crossover theories .",
    "however , there are now momentum resolved rf studies @xcite which probe the spectral function more directly , in a fashion similar to angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) probes of condensed matter . a central aim of this paper is to show how these studies in future will be able to differentiate more clearly between the different crossover schools .",
    "here we confine our attention to homogeneous systems , although experiments are necessarily done for the trapped case .",
    "in addition to rf spectroscopy , it was proposed @xcite that the spectral function can also be measured in raman spectroscopy .",
    "we note that for the htscs , arpes studies have been centrally important in revealing information about the superconducting as well as the pseudogap phases @xcite .",
    "indeed , the close relation between arpes and radio frequency probes has been discussed in our recent review @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the spectral function of htscs in the pseudogap phase appears to exhibit dispersion features similar to those in the superconducting phase .",
    "this spectral function is modeled @xcite by a broadened bcs form with a self energy @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the ( @xmath33 or @xmath1-wave ) excitation gap of the normal phase and @xmath38 is a phenomenological damping .",
    "frequently , one adds an additional , structureless imaginary damping term @xmath39 , as well .",
    "high temperature superconductor experiments at temperatures as high as @xmath40 have reported that in the regions of the brillouin zone ( where the pseudogap is well established ) , the dispersion of the fermionic excitations behaves like @xmath41    importantly eq .",
    "( [ eq:3a ] ) has also been used in the cold gas studies @xcite in the region near and above @xmath2 and implemented phenomenologically below @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this both demonstrates the presence of pairing and ultimately provides information about the size of the pairing gap .",
    "it has been shown that eq .",
    "( [ eq:2a ] ) is reasonably robust in the extended bcs - leggett state above @xmath2 , at least up to temperatures @xcite of the order of @xmath42 .",
    "by contrast this approximate self energy is not generally suitable to nsr theory @xcite , although for @xmath43 a fit to eq .",
    "( [ eq:3a ] ) has been obtained . in a similar context",
    "we note that in the flex approach , the spectral function and associated self energy is not of the broadened bcs form .",
    "mathematically , this bcs - like structure in the self energy and fermionic dispersion ( which is numerically obtained ) comes from the facts that the effective pair chemical potential @xmath44 at and below @xmath2 , and that by having one bare and one dressed green s function in @xmath14 there is a gap in the pair excitation spectrum so that the pairs are long lived ; in this way @xmath38 ( which scales with the inverse pair lifetime ) is small .",
    "physically , we can say that this behavior reflects the stability of low momentum pairs near @xmath2 and below .",
    "these differences between the three different crossover theories become less apparent for the momentum integrated rf signals . in the bcs - leggett approach at low temperatures",
    "the dominant structure comes from pair breaking of the condensate ( which would be associated with the negative root in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3a ] ) ) .",
    "despite the fact that their fermionic dispersions are different , both other theories yield a very similar  positive detuning branch \" in the rf spectrum @xcite . however , at higher temperatures , both for polarized and unpolarized gases , there is theoretical evidence of the  negative detuning branch \" arising from the positive root in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3a ] ) in the bcs - leggett based approach @xcite .",
    "this is absent in the two other schemes , at least within the normal state .",
    "it also appears to be difficult to see experimentally in the unpolarized case , although it is clearly evident once even a small polarization @xcite is present @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections  [ sec : nsrtheory ] and [ sec : g0gtheory ] briefly review nsr theory and bcs - leggett theory as extended to non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "section  [ sec : spectral ] addresses a comparison of the spectral function at unitarity and on the bec side obtained from the two theories . in subsections  [ sec : dos ]",
    "we plot a comparison of the related density of states at unitarity and in  [ sec : rf ] we address a comparison of rf spectra in the two theories for an unpolarized fermi gas which also addresses experimental data . also included is a prediction of rf spectra on the bec side of resonance . the remaining sections ( section  [ sec : rftc ] and section  [ sec : rfpol ] ) do not focus on comparisons because the issues discussed pertain to questions which only bcs - leggett theory has been able to address . here",
    "we propose a subtle signature of the superfluid transition in section  [ sec : rftc ] which could be addressed in future and in section  [ sec : rfpol ] we address the theoretical rf spectrum of polarized fermi gases at unitarity and its comparison with experimental data . section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes this paper .",
    "we remark that in this paper we study @xmath33-wave pairing in three spatial dimensions which is more relevant to ultra - cold fermi gases while htscs should be modeled as @xmath1-wave pairing in quasi - two dimensions .",
    "however , as one will see , there are many interesting common features in these two systems .",

    "since the experimental rf spectra were obtained from rf tomography of trapped polarized fermi gases , we follow a similar procedure to extract our rf spectra at varying , but comparable locations from a similar trap profile .",
    "also indicated are the polarizations @xmath200 . if we make fewer restrictions on the choice of radial variable , the agreement is better as is shown in ref .",
    "to compare the results , we normalized the maxima and align the spectra , thereby introducing a fit to hartree contributions .",
    "the left ( right ) column shows the rf spectra of the majority ( minority ) . here",
    "we set @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "the experimental data points from the left hand column can be compared with those in figure  [ fig : rf_ia0 ] which are for the @xmath209 case , and it is seen that even at very small polarizations ( say @xmath210 ) the negative detuning peak becomes visible",
    ". indeed , it appears here to be larger than the theoretically estimated negative detuning peak height .",
    "a possible explanation for why the double - peak structure can be resolved experimentally in polarized but not in unpolarized fermi gases is because the existence of excess majority fermions causes a negative rf - detuning peak even at low temperatures . at these lower @xmath0",
    "the separation between the two peaks can be large in the experimental rf spectra of polarized fermi gases .",
    "in contrast , for an unpolarized fermi gas the negative rf - detuning peak due to thermally excited quasiparticles only becomes significant at high temperatures around @xmath2 and above . here",
    "the separation between the two peaks may not be as readily resolved .",
    "as expected , at low temperatures there is only a single peak in the rf spectra of the minority .",
    "we notice that at extremely high polarization , polaron - like behavior has been observed in rf experiments @xcite , whose explanation has attracted a great deal of attention in the theoretical community @xcite .",

    "the red curves correspond to the actual data and the black curves are obtained from this theory .",
    "an additional resolution broadening is included in the theory and one can see that this theoretical approach appears to be in quite reasonable agreement with experiment . in this way",
    "there is some support for this simplest of ground states  at least in the polarized case .",
    "the goal of this paper is to communicate that bcs - bec crossover theories are very exciting .",
    "they are currently being clarified and developed hand in hand with experiment . for the fermi superfluids , unlike their bose counterparts , we have no ready - made theory . in this paper",
    "we confine our attention to the normal phase , although we have presented a discussion of some of the controversial issues which have surface in the literature below @xmath2 .",
    "we view the principal value of this paper is the presentation of comparisons of two different crossover theories and the identification of ( mostly future ) experiments which can help distinguish them .",
    "the two theories we consider are the extended bcs - leggett theory and that of nozieres and schmitt - rink .",
    "we chose not to discuss the flex or luttinger - ward scheme in any detail because it is discussed elsewhere @xcite , and because there are concerns that , by ignoring vertex corrections , this approach has omitted the important physics associated with the pseudogap .",
    "these concerns are longstanding @xcite . here",
    "we have argued that the extended bcs - leggett theory is the one theory which preserves ( broadened ) bcs features into the normal state over a significant range of temperatures . even above @xmath2 one",
    "finds that the fermionic excitations have an ( albeit , smeared out ) dispersion of the form @xmath211 in the normal state .",
    "we find that nsr theory does not have this dispersion , although it has a pseudogap by all other measures .",
    "interestingly high @xmath2 superconductors have been shown to have this dispersion in their normal state @xcite and it is generally believed @xcite that their fermionic self energy can be fit to a broadened ( @xmath1-wave ) bcs form @xmath212 .    in this paper we show that one can identify both physically and mathematically the difference between the two normal states of the different crossover theories .",
    "mathematically because bcs theory involves one dressed green s function in the pair susceptibility , it leads to a low frequency gap in the t - matrix or pair propagator ( at low @xmath157 ) .",
    "physically this serves to stabilize low momentum pairs .",
    "this helps us to understand that the pseudogap of nsr theory does not incorporate primarily low momentum pairs , but rather pairs of all momentum and that it should be better further from condensation .",
    "indeed , this is reenforced by our observation that at higher @xmath0 , feedback effects which distinguish the two theories becomes less and less important and the bcs - leggett pair susceptibility , @xmath125 , crosses over to something closer to @xmath152 as in nsr theory . our simplest approximation for the self energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2a ] ) is no longer suitable once temperature exceeds , say @xmath213 .",
    "indeed this is reenforced by earlier numerical observations @xcite .    as a result",
    ", we believe that both theories are right but in different temperature regimes .",
    "moreover , this serves to elucidate another concern about nsr theory ( and flex theory) that they are associated with an unphysical first order transition .",
    "both theories change discontinuously in going from above to below @xmath2 . in the superfluid phase",
    "the coupling which is included in all other theories is between the non - condensed pairs and the collective modes of the condensate , even though in the normal state one couples the fermions and the non - condensed pairs . in the extended bcs - leggett theory , ( as seems reasonable , in the vicinity of @xmath2 both above and below )",
    ", the dominant coupling is , indeed , between non - condensed pairs and fermions .",
    "these ( effectively , pseudogap ) effects will behave smoothly across @xmath2 .",
    "the goldstone modes which turn on at @xmath2 are highly damped in its vicinity , where the condensate is weak . only at lower @xmath0",
    "should their coupling become the more important .    in summary , a central conclusion of this study of the spectral functions of the extended bcs - leggett theory and nsr theory is that one may expect that the former is suitable near @xmath2 due to its similarity to bcs theory while the latter better describes the normal phase at much higher @xmath0 as the system approaches a fermi liquid , and concomitantly , the pseudogap begins to disappear .",
    "in the course of this work we have found that the theoretical rf spectra from both theories agree ( only semi - quantitatively ) to about the same extent with experimental data at unitarity .",
    "the bcs - leggett approach has the advantage that it can address the rf spectrum of generally polarized fermi gases without the problems which have been noted @xcite for the nsr approach",
