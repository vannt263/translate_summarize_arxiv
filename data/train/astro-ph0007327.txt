    "x - ray observations are excellent for studying the accretion process in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) because they allow us to see directly into the galaxy core to determine what happens around the black hole , all the way from the gravitational radius out to scales @xmath110 billion times larger .",
    "x - rays can arise anywhere there is matter to reprocess high - energy continuum photons .",
    "features of x - ray reprocessing such as fe k@xmath0 lines and compton reflection ( lightman & white 1988 , guilbert & rees 1988 ) , can arise from an accretion disk ( george & fabian 1991 ) or the obscuring torus of unified models ( krolik , madau & zycki 1994 , ghisellini , haardt & matt 1994 ) . significant fe k@xmath0 emission may also be produced in distributions of clouds such as the uv / optical broad line region .",
    "spectral variability is critical to understanding where reflection / fluorescence features arise .",
    "if the reprocessing arises in an accretion disk , we expect it to respond to the continuum with a lag of only @xmath2 s , where @xmath3 is the mass of the central black hole in units of @xmath4 .",
    "if it comes from as far out as an obscuring torus , the lag should be @xmath5 s , where @xmath6 is the luminosity in units of @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 . for current favored models of seyfert 1s where the observed reprocessing occurs in a neutral and compton - thick accretion disk , the iron line and reflection hump",
    "should be physically coupled .",
    "mcg @xmath92 - 58 - 22 is a bright , unabsorbed seyfert 1 galaxy with evidence for a doppler broadened iron line ( fwhm of @xmath10 km s@xmath8 ; weaver et al .",
    "it was observed with _",
    "asca _ and _ rxte _ for a total of 38 ks on december 15 , 1997 .",
    "mcg @xmath92 - 58 - 22 varies significantly on timescales of years ( figure 1 ) , changing intensity by a factor of three between _ asca _ observations in 1993 and 1997 .",
    "the _ asca _ + _ rxte _ spectrum and best - fitting model are shown in figure 2 . using the _ pexrav _ model in _ xspec _ and assuming a face - on disk ( where r = 1 for @xmath11 coverage ) , _ rxte _ detects essentially no reflection , with an upper limit of r = 0.08 . comparing _",
    "asca _ observations , the iron line normalization stays constant at @xmath12 photons @xmath13 s@xmath8 and the ew drops from @xmath14 ev to @xmath15 ev in four years .",
    "the lack of reflection is puzzling if the broad iron line comes from a disk .",
    "although a large disk inclination or overabundance of iron can suppress reflection , the iron line would be much broader than observed in the former case and much stronger in the latter .",
    "relativistic smearing of the compton hump is also not likely because this would smear out the line .",
    "plausible explanations include a partly ionized accretion disk , a cutoff in the intrinsic spectrum at energies between 10 and 40 kev , a compton - thin accretion disk , or a lag in the response of reflection to the continuum ( larger than that of the iron line ) .",
    "the spectrum can be more easily explained if the iron line originates elsewhere .",
    "the constant line strength suggests that the line originates at least a few light years away .",
    "in fact , the line width is marginally consistent with the inferred velocity of the uv / optical broad line region clouds ( 16,000 km s@xmath8 ; wu , boggess & gull 1981 ) .",
    "blr clouds with @xmath16 @xmath13 would produce fluorescence but no reflection .",
    "an obvious complication for spectral studies is the contribution of reprocessed emission from non - disk regions . to study this",
    ", we have looked at 15 seyfert 1 galaxies with multiple observations in the _ asca _ archive .",
    "( gelbord and weaver , this volume ) . modeling the iron line with a narrow gaussian ( to fit the line core )",
    ", we find that eleven galaxies show some evidence for a change in ew .",
    "this can be explained as a significant time delay in flux from the line core , which might be due to emission from the outer disk , the blr or the torus .",
    "one of the best examples of non - variability is ngc 4151 , for which the line core flux does not change and the the ew is inversely proportional to the continuum flux ( figure 3 ) .    in a second study , we obtained four _ rxte _ observations of mcg@xmath95 - 23 - 16 in 1996 and 1997 spaced @xmath17 months apart .",
    "the spectral results are plotted in figure 4 . between the third ( a long - look covering two days ) and fourth pointings , the @xmath18 kev flux decreases while the line normalization remains the same and the ew drops from about 200 ev to 150 ev ( mattson and weaver , in prep ) .",
    "the lack of response to the continuum suggests that at least some of the line emission occurs from far out .",
    "however , the reflection component tracks the continuum during the same time .",
    "if real , this would strongly support the idea that mcg 5 - 23 - 16 has _ two _ physically distinct reprocessing regions .",
    "similar behavior of the iron line not tracking reflection is seen by _ rxte _ for ngc 5548 ( chiang et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "errors are 90% confidence for two parameters . *",
    "a 4% systematic error is included .",
    "preliminary _ rxte _ and _",
    "asca _ results suggest that fe k@xmath0 emission and compton reflection are at least partly decoupled in their behavior .",
    "such a result has strong implications and thus deserves close scrutiny .",
    "in particular , it is important to rule out any possible systematic calibration effects .",
    "the pca detector calibration is still being refined ; however , up to december 1997 , the _ ftools _ v4.1 matrix for gain epoch 3 ( 4/15/96  3/22/99 ) provides good fits to the crab spectrum with less than 4% residuals near @xmath19 kev and @xmath20 kev ( k. jahoda , private communication ) .",
    "table 1 compares results for a handful of seyfert 1 galaxies observed during 1996 and 1997 .",
    "data were fitted with the _ pexrav _ plus gaussian models in _ xspec _ and response matrices were generated for each observation with _",
    "mcg 2 - 58 - 22 was observed at the end of 1997 , where response deviations from the crab begin , but there is no clear systematic trend for r to decrease with time .",
    "it is possible that r is systematically underestimated ( the mean for ic 4329a is 0.43 , where r=1 for an accretion disk ) , but this can not account for the non - detection in mcg 2 - 58 - 22 , even after including a 4% systematic error .",
    "we conclude that there is no time - dependent ( i.e. , calibration - dependent ) trend for r to decrease with time .",
    "results are summarized from an _ rxte _ and _ asca _ investigation of spectral variability in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the spectra defy a simple interpretation , with significant time lags and the fe k@xmath0 line and compton reflection behaving in a decoupled fashion .",
    "a possible explanation is that the spectral variability of the accretion - disk is diluted by emission from other , larger regions ."
