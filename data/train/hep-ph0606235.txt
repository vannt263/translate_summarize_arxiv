    "the study of weak nuclear reactions induced by neutrinos and antineutrinos in the energy region of few gev has become quite important due to the role played by these processes in the analysis of various neutrino oscillation experiments being done with atmospheric and accelerator neutrinos in the intermediate energy region  @xcite . in this energy region , the theoretical cross sections for various weak processes induced by neutrinos and antineutrinos on nucleons and nuclei are needed to model neutrino - nuclear interactions in monte carlo neutrino generators like nuance  @xcite , neugen  @xcite , neut  @xcite or more general codes like fluka  @xcite which are being used by groups doing neutrino oscillation experiments . the dominant weak process of current interest is the quasi - elastic production of leptons induced by @xmath2 charged and neutral weak currents which has been extensively studied in literature including nuclear effects using various approaches  @xcite .",
    "however , in this energy region other processes in which pions , kaons and hyperons are produced can also be important .",
    "in particular , the inelastic processes where single pions are produced by weak charged and neutral currents have recently attracted much attention as they play a very important role in performing the background studies in the analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "many authors  @xcite have recently studied the weak pion production from nucleons and nuclei in the energy region relevant for the ongoing neutrino oscillation experiments by k2k@xcite and miniboone collaborations@xcite . in some of these studies the nuclear effects in the weak pion production process as well as in the final state interaction ( fsi ) of outgoing pions with the final nucleus have also been taken into account  @xcite .    there",
    "exist very few calculations for the neutrino production of strange baryons and mesons from free nucleons . in these calculations",
    "the hyperon nucleon transition form factors are determined either from the cabibbo theory with su(3 ) symmetry  @xcite or from some quark models used for describing the baryon structure@xcite .",
    "there are no calculations to our knowledge where nuclear effects have been included in the weak production of strange particles from nuclei induced by neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino production of strange particles is induced by weak charged as well as neutral currents .",
    "the weak neutral currents induce only @xmath2 processes due to absence of flavour changing neutral currents ( in the standard model ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the weak charged currents induce both @xmath2 and @xmath3 processes .",
    "the production of strange particles through @xmath3 processes is suppressed by a factor @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the cabibbo angle , as compared to the @xmath2 processes . however , in the low energy region of @xmath6gev , the associated production of strange particles through @xmath2 processes is suppressed by phase space .",
    "therefore , it is likely that in this low energy region , the cross sections for the production of strange particles through @xmath3 and @xmath2 processes become comparable . in the case of the weak production of strange particles through @xmath3 processes ,",
    "the @xmath7 selection rule restricts the quasi elastic hyperon production to antineutrinos rather than neutrinos . as a consequence , in the @xmath8 sector",
    "only antineutrino induced reactions like @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a @xmath11 hyperon ( hyperon resonance ) are allowed .",
    "therefore , the only possible quasi - elastic @xmath3 hyperon @xmath12 production processes allowed in the neutrino(antineutrino ) induced reactions are @xmath13 these reactions have been experimentally studied in past but the experimental information is very scanty and comes mainly from some older experiments performed with the gargamelle  @xcite and the skat  @xcite bubble chambers filled with heavy liquid like freon and/or propane  @xcite .",
    "the number of observed events was small leading to cross sections with large error bars due to poor statistics .",
    "however , the results for the cross sections were found to be consistent with predictions of the cabibbo theory with su(3 ) symmetry . a suppression of cross sections due to nuclear medium effects",
    "is clearly seen , specially in the experiments of erriquez et al .",
    "@xcite but no attempts have been made to theoretically estimate the nuclear medium effects on the weak production of hyperons from nuclei .",
    "an understanding of these nuclear effects would be useful for the analysis of future experiments which are being planned to study the weak production of strange particles in the context of neutrino oscillation and proton decay search experiments .",
    "such experiments are planned with the numi beamline in the minerva experiment  @xcite .",
    "these reactions may also be seen at k2k and miniboone where the effective reach of neutrino energy for cross section measurement could reach about 3 gev  @xcite .",
    "the study of weak production of strange particles is an important subject in itself as it helps to experimentally determine the momentum dependence of various transition form factors and test the theoretical models proposed for su(3 ) breaking in semileptonic @xmath3 processes .    in this paper",
    "we report on the study of antineutrino induced quasi - elastic production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 hyperons from nucleons i.e. reactions ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) and also the effects of nuclear medium and final state interactions when these reactions take place on nucleons bound in nuclei . in section  [ formalism ] , we describe the general formalism for calculating the differential and total cross section for the process @xmath14 using cabibbo theory with su(3 ) symmetry where the transition form factors for @xmath15 transitions are determined from a theoretical analysis of the latest experiments on semileptonic decay of hyperons , i.e @xmath16 . in section",
    "[ nuclear ] , we describe the nuclear medium effects when these reactions take place in nuclei like @xmath17 or @xmath18 which are target nuclei for future detectors planned to be used in neutrino oscillation and proton decay search experiments . in section [ results ] , we present the numerical results for total and differential cross sections for production of leptons and hadrons from nucleon and nuclear targets .",
    "we also consider the pion production due to the weak decay of the hyperons . finally we summarize and give main conclusions of our work in the last section .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath19 for the process @xmath20 , with @xmath21 is given by    @xmath22    leading to @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the cm neutrino energy , @xmath26 is the nucleon mass and @xmath27 is the scattering amplitude matrix element written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 for @xmath3 processes and @xmath30 for @xmath2 processes . the matrix elements @xmath31 and @xmath32 correspond to the transition matrix elements of the vector and axial currents @xmath33 and @xmath34 which are defined as @xmath35u_n(p)\\\\ \\label{defff2 } < y(p^\\prime)|a_\\mu|n(p)>={\\bar{u}_y}(p^\\prime)\\left[\\gamma_\\mu g_1(q^2)+i\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu } \\frac{q^\\nu}{m+m_y}g_2(q^2)+\\frac{g_3(q^2)}{m_y}q_\\mu\\right]\\gamma^5\\ , u_n(p)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , ( @xmath38 ) are the vector and axial vector transition form factors . in defining these matrix elements , we follow the bjorken drell  @xcite conventions for the dirac matrices .",
    "the determination of these form factors is done using cabibbo theory with su(3 ) symmetry which describes the recent precision data on semileptonic decays of hyperons  @xcite quite well .",
    "the corrections due to su(3 ) breaking effects on semileptonic decays have been discussed in literature and are found to be small  @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we briefly outline the procedure for determination of various vector and axial vector transition form factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 defined in equations  [ defff ] and  [ defff2 ] .      in the standard model ,",
    "the vector and axial vector currents @xmath33 and @xmath34 are defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the generators of flavour su(3 ) . assuming that , @xmath41 and @xmath42 belong to the octet representation of flavour su(3 ) , and neglecting any su(3 ) breaking effects , vector and axial vector transition form factors for all the n@xmath43 y transitions can be expressed in terms of two functions for vector(axial vector ) current which could be determined from the experimental data on semileptonic decays of nucleons and hyperons .",
    "this is because , the coupling of initial and final baryon states belonging to an octet representation of su(3 ) , through an octet of vector ( axial vector ) currents is described in terms of two reduced matrix elements f and d corresponding to the antisymmetric and symmetric coupling of two octets of baryons in the initial and final state to the octet of vector ( axial vector ) currents , through su(3 ) clebsch gordan coefficients .",
    "more precisely , the vector and axial vector form factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 defined above are given in terms of the functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 corresponding to vector couplings and @xmath46 and @xmath47 corresponding to axial vector couplings as @xmath48 the constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the su(3 ) clebsch gordan coefficients given in table  [ tabi ] for the reactions of our present interest .",
    "we see that all the form factors for @xmath51 are @xmath52 times the form factors @xmath53 transitions , leading to the prediction that @xmath54 .",

    "when the reactions shown in equations ( 1 - 3 ) take place on nucleons which are bound in the nucleus , certain constraints on their dynamics arising due to the fermi motion and pauli blocking effects of initial nucleons have to be considered . in the final state",
    "the produced hyperons are not subjected to any pauli blocking but are affected by the final state interactions with the nucleus through the hyperon nucleon quasi - elastic and charge exchange scattering processes .",
    "moreover , the charged lepton in the final state moves in the coulomb field of the final nucleus . however , in the energy region of 1- 3 gev",
    ", the effect of coulomb distortion of the charged lepton wave function is small and is neglected in the present calculations .",
    "the fermi motion effects are calculated in a local fermi gas model where the the differential cross section for the process @xmath57 is now written as    @xmath58 is the local occupation number of the initial nucleon of momentum @xmath59 localized at a radius @xmath60 in the nucleus , and is determined in the local density approximation . here , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the neutrino energy in the nucleon - neutrino cm system and the nucleon neutrino invariant mass squared respectively . solving the @xmath63 function of momentum conservation ,",
    "we do the integration over the hyperon momentum @xmath64 , and we use the @xmath63 function of energies to integrate the cosinus of the angle of the initial nucleon momentum @xmath65 .",
    "then , the differential cross section for the quasielastic hyperon production from nuclei can be written as @xmath66 with @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the target nucleon density in the nucleus which is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite for the protons , and scaled with a factor @xmath69 for the neutrons .",
    "all kinematic variables are defined by the integral itself , except the cosinus of relative angle between @xmath65 and @xmath70 which is obtained from the @xmath63 function of energies .    to obtain these formulas",
    "we have followed a quasi - free approach where both @xmath1 and @xmath0 have been treated as stable particles , with a well defined energy for a given momentum .",
    "this is acceptable because both are quite narrow even in the nuclear medium , see i.e. ref .",
    "@xcite , where additional decay channels are present . also , in the actual implementation of eq .",
    "[ nuc.eq ] when solving the @xmath63 of energies , we have neglected the real part of the hyperon optical potential in the nucleus .",
    "we have checked numerically that potentials of a typical size ( @xmath71 ) do not modify appreciably the results .",
    "the hyperons @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 which are produced in reactions ( 1 - 3 ) undergo elastic and charge exchange scattering with the nucleons present in the nucleus through strong interactions while some of the @xmath73 disappear through the electromagnetic decay channel @xmath75 .",
    "therefore the production cross sections for the hyperons from the nuclear targets are affected by the presence of the electromagnetic and strong interactions of final state hyperons in the nuclear medium .",
    "one of the interesting features of the final state interactions(fsi ) of hyperons in the nuclear medium is the appearance of @xmath76 hyperons which are not produced in the basic weak process induced by the @xmath77 .",
    "this is due to charge exchange scattering processes like @xmath78 and @xmath79 which can take place in nuclei .",
    "the effect of fsi on the weak production cross section for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath72 and the appearance of @xmath76 are estimated with the help of a monte carlo code for propagation of hyperons in the nuclear medium using as input the scarce available experimental cross sections for the hyperon nucleon scattering cross sections .",
    "we have compiled the parametrizations used in this work in the appendix .",
    "> from eq .",
    "[ eq.nuc ] we can obtain @xmath80 after performing the integration over the rest of variables .",
    "this profile function is then used as input for our monte carlo simulation .",
    "we generate hyperon production events by selecting a random position @xmath60 and a momentum @xmath81 and assigning to the event the weight given by the profile function .",
    "we then assume the real part of the hyperons nuclear potential to be weak compared with their kinetic energies and propagate them following straight lines till they are out of the nucleus . to take into account the collisions we follow the hyperon by moving it a short distance @xmath82 , along its momentum direction , such that @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the probability of interaction per unit length .",
    "a random number @xmath85 $ ] is generated and we consider that an interaction has taken place when @xmath86 . if no interaction occurs we repeat the procedure by moving the hyperon a new step @xmath82 .",
    "the probability of interaction per unit length of a hyperon @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 accounts for all possible final channels , @xmath90 and @xmath59 are neutrons and protons and @xmath91 , @xmath92 are their local densities .",
    "the cross section is evaluated at an invariant energy of the neutrino - nucleon system averaged over the local fermi sea .",
    "we use a threshold energy cut of 30 mev for quasielastic collisions ( @xmath93,@xmath94 ) . below this energy , we only consider possible @xmath95 processes . thus , the energy spectra at those low kinetic energies will not be meaningful .    if the hyperon has interacted we select the channel accordingly to their respective probabilities . finally , once the channel has been selected , we approximately implement pauli blocking with the following procedure . a random nucleon is selected in the local fermi sea . assuming isotropic cross sections in the hyperon - nucleon cm system , we generate a random scattering angle in that system and calculate the hyperon and nucleon momenta . finally , we boost these momenta to the lab system .",
    "if the final nucleon is below the fermi level ( pauli blocked ) we consider that there was no interaction and the hyperon continues its movement .",
    "otherwise , we have a new hyperon type and/or a new direction and energy .",
    "it should be mentioned that all this procedure does not modify neither the @xmath96 cross section , nor the @xmath97 dependence of that observable , and only the type of outgoing hyperon and its energy and angle distributions are modified . in exclusive reactions , where both the lepton and the hyperon are observed ,",
    "there could be some changes due to the fact that the lepton distributions would correspond to those of the primary hyperon and not to that of the observed one that could be of a different kind .",
    "the numerical evaluations of the quasielastic production of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath72 hyperons induced by antineutrinos from free nucleons have been done using eq .",
    "[ crosv.eq ] with the form factors given in table  [ tabii ] .",
    "the nuclear medium effects due to fermi motion are incorporated through eq .",
    "[ nuc.eq ] .",
    "the fsi effects , due to hyperon nucleon elastic and charge exchange scattering processes in presence of other nucleons in nuclei are taken into account using a monte carlo simulation described in section  [ mc ] .",
    "all the results presented here correspond to muonic antineutrinos .",
    "we first present the differential cross section for antineutrino induced @xmath3 weak quasielastic processes from nucleon and nuclear targets .",
    "the sensitivity of the differential cross sections to the axial vector dipole mass has been studied .",
    "we have also studied the effect of nuclear medium and final state interactions on the differential cross sections .",
    "we find that in the range of energies under analysis , fermi motion of the nucleons and fsi of the hyperons do not appreciably modify the lepton distributions , except for a scale factor that can also be seen in the total cross sections .    as a typical case",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ difq2.fig ] the @xmath97 dependence on free nucleons and on @xmath98 at @xmath99 gev .",
    "the lowest curve corresponds to the small @xmath76 production which occurs via fsi .",
    "the other lines show the results for the @xmath0 , @xmath74 and @xmath73 .",
    "the results without fsi are very close to the free nucleon ones and are not shown .",
    "even the full model curves have the same shape .",
    "thus , we find that nuclear data could still be used to investigate the @xmath97 dependence of the form factors in the hyperons sector .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dsdq2nuc.fig ] , the @xmath100 dependence is very mild .",
    "this is specially so at low energies and for the case of @xmath1 production . only at relatively large antineutrino energies and for @xmath0 production",
    "the cross section shows some sensitivity to this parameter .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ spectrum.fig ] the hyperons spectra with and without fsi for 1 gev antineutrinos .",
    "the main effect of fsi is a redistribution of strength , pushing the spectra towards lower energies .",
    "this is due to quasielastic collisions with the nucleons and also to inelastic scattering , in which the kind of hyperon changes and part of the energy is passed to the nucleons .",
    "also remarkable is the appearance of @xmath76 through the @xmath101 and @xmath102 processes .",
    "this channel is not present on free nucleons and will be further discussed in the next section .",
    "we should recall here that our mc code does not include neither the effects of the real part of the optical potentials nor interactions of particles with kinetic energies below 30 mev .",
    "therefore , the results at those low energies are not meaningful and are shown only for illustrative purposes .",
    "we present in figures  [ lambdamuon.fig]-[sigma0muon.fig ] the numerical results for the muonic antineutrino total cross sections @xmath103 for free nucleons and for @xmath98 and @xmath104 , divided in the nuclear case by the number of `` active '' nucleons , with and without the inclusion of fsi .",
    "we see from these figures that    \\(i ) the effect of the fermi motion of the initial nucleons is quite small on the quasielastic production of hyperons even for a heavy nucleus like @xmath104 as shown in figures  [ lambdamuon.fig]-[sigma0muon.fig ] . of course",
    ", this effect is larger at energies , not shown in the figures , very close to threshold , where the cross sections are very small . actually , in the nuclear case , the production threshold changes due to fermi motion although the exact size of the effect depends on the hyperon nucleus optical potential .",
    "\\(ii ) the effect of hyperons fsi leads to an increase of the cross sections for @xmath0 production and a decrease of @xmath73 and @xmath74 production cross sections .",
    "this change in the cross section per nucleon increases with the charge and mass number of the nucleus and is larger for @xmath104 as compared to @xmath98 .",
    "this is because @xmath105 can disappear through the quasielastic processes like @xmath106 , @xmath107 and others , while the inverse process of depletion of @xmath0 is also allowed , but inhibited due to the difference in masses .",
    "in addition to these strong processes leading to the depletion of @xmath73 , they are further depleted by the electromagnetic decay @xmath108 .",
    "this has not been included in the calculation as the mean life guarantees that the decay will occur out of the nucleus and can be easily taken into account when comparing with data .",
    "\\(iii ) for free nucleon targets , the cross section for production of @xmath0 is always greater than the cross section for production of @xmath73 .",
    "the ratio @xmath109 reaches an asymptotic value of around 0.3 which is consistent with older results of cabibbo and chilton  @xcite but is considerably different with the prediction of a relativistic quark model due to finjord and ravndal@xcite .",
    "this ratio is considerably smaller at low energies due to threshold effects which suppress @xmath73 production compared to @xmath0 production .",
    "the sensitivity of this ratio for two values of the axial vector dipole mass @xmath100 is shown in fig .",
    "[ ratio.fig ] .",
    "\\(iv ) for free nucleon targets , using su(3 ) symmetric form factors , the ratio of cross sections for @xmath2 and @xmath3 induced processes by antineutrinos , i.e. @xmath110 reaches an asymptotic value of 0.04 .",
    "this value comes mainly due to the cabibbo suppression and from the threshold effects which are quite large in this case .",
    "the energy dependence of this ratio along with its sensitivity to the value of the axial vector dipole mass @xmath100 is shown in fig .",
    "[ ratio2.fig ] .",
    "\\(v ) in fig .",
    "[ sigmaplus.fig ] , we show the cross section for @xmath76 production .",
    "whereas in the other channels fsi produces simply a correction to the direct process , in this case all events come from fsi and therefore the cross section is very sensitive to the relatively unknown hyperon nucleon cross sections .",
    "this channel is a source of positive pions induced by a charged current antineutrino process , but the cross section is very small and other sources , like charge exchange reactions of pions produced inside the nuclei by other processes , as discussed below , will be more important .",
    "currently , there is considerable interest in the weak pion production cross sections . for these processes , @xmath55 excitation followed by its decay will be dominant at intermediate energies given its strong coupling to the pion nucleon system",
    "however , two aspects deplete its contribution to the pion production in nuclei .",
    "first , the mean life of the @xmath55 is very short .",
    "thus , it decays inside the nucleus and part of the pions are absorbed and do nt come out of the nucleus .",
    "this is quite different to the hyperons case which decay weakly into pions .",
    "the hyperons large mean life implies that most of the times they decay already far from the nucleus avoiding the pion absorption . on the other hand",
    ", the mass of the @xmath55 implies that the cross section decreases at low enough energies faster than for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cases .",
    "these two factors could partially compensate for the @xmath4 suppression .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ pion.fig ] our results for pion production , obtained using the experimental branching ratios for the hyperons and the previous calculations for the hyperon production cross sections .",
    "we also show results derived from the @xmath55 production cross section in @xmath98 of ref .",
    "@xcite which incorporated pion absorption . in that paper ,",
    "only the total number of pions ( or @xmath55 s ) was obtained . in order to compare with",
    "the current results , we have used the corresponding isospin factors to assign the charges of the pions ( relative weights for @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are 1/9 , 2/9 and 1 ) , thus neglecting possible pion charge exchange reactions .",
    "we see that at low energies pions from hyperon decays dominate and the @xmath55 mechanism becomes dominant at energies above 550 mev for negative pions and 650 mev for neutral pions",
    ". the importance of the hyperon mechanisms would be larger for heavier nuclei , where pion absorption would suppress more strongly other competing mechanisms which produce the pions inside the nucleons .",
    "we have studied the weak charged current induced quasielastic production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 hyperons from nucleons and nuclei .",
    "the transition form factors for the nucleon - hyperon transitions determined from an analysis experimental data on neutrino nucleon scattering and semileptonic decays of hyperons using cabibbo theory with su(3 ) symmetry have been applied to calculate the the total and differential cross sections for lepton and hyperon production from nucleon and nuclear targets .",
    "the nuclear medium and final state interaction effects have been calculated for the hyperon production from nuclear targets like @xmath98 and @xmath104 which are proposed to be used in future detectors for neutrino oscillations and proton decay search experiments .",
    "these are calculated in a local fermi gas model for the nuclei and a simple energy dependent parametrization for the hyperon nucleon scattering cross sections .",
    "the hyperon energy distribution for the quasielastic production of @xmath0 , @xmath76 and @xmath73 hyperons induced by antineutrinos and the effect of final state interactions on their energy distribution has been studied .",
    "the energy distribution of @xmath76 , which are produced only as a consequence of final state interactions has also been presented .",
    "finally the total cross sections for pion production due to decays of hyperons has been presented and compared with the pion production cross sections from @xmath55 production .",
    "the main conclusions that can be drawn from our present study are :    \\(i ) the differential cross sections @xmath114 are more sensitive to the axial vector dipole mass for the case of @xmath0 production than @xmath1 production .",
    "however this sensitivity is not as large as compared to to the sensitivity of @xmath114 to the axial vector dipole mass for neutrino nucleon scattering in the @xmath2 sector .",
    "\\(ii ) the effect of nuclear medium effects on @xmath114 and total cross section @xmath115 on the hyperon production is quite small .",
    "\\(iii ) the effect of final state interaction is to increase the cross sections for @xmath116 production and to decrease the cross section for @xmath74 and @xmath73 production . the strength of production cross section shifts towards the lower energy of the produced hyperon as a result of final state interactions .",
    "the most interesting aspect of the final state interaction is that it leads to the production of @xmath117 hyperons which is of the order of 10@xmath118 of the @xmath119 production cross sections from oxygen targets around 1 gev .",
    "this proportion increases with mass and charge of the nucleus .",
    "\\(iv ) the hyperon production is dominated by @xmath120 production and the production cross section for @xmath73 is small at lower energies but could approach 30@xmath118 of @xmath0 production as the energy increases and becomes larger than 1.0 gev .",
    "\\(v ) at low energies , the nuclear pion production induced by antineutrinos through the production of hyperons and their subsequent decays can become important as compared to the antineutrino pion production through the excitation and subsequent decays of @xmath55 resonance .",
    "this , for example , happens for neutrino energies e @xmath121550(650 ) mev ) for the case of antineutrino induced @xmath122 production at intermediate energies from @xmath98 target .",
