    "in distributed storage systems , repair cost metrics include repair locality @xcite , repair bandwidth @xcite and disk - i / o @xcite . recently , locally repairable codes ( lrcs ) introduced by gopalan _",
    "_ @xcite have attracted a lot of interest .",
    "the @xmath7th symbol @xmath17 of an @xmath3 $ ] linear code @xmath4 over the finite field @xmath18 is said to have _ locality _",
    "@xmath0 if this symbol can be recovered by accessing at most @xmath0 other symbols of @xmath4 .",
    "coding techniques are then introduced in distributed storage systems to reduce the storage overhead , while maintaining high data reliability .",
    "maximum distance separable ( mds ) codes can be used as erasure codes in distributed storage systems and any symbol can be recovered by accessing any @xmath19 other symbols . in order to reduce the repair costs in distributed storage systems",
    ", the locality parameter @xmath20 is often demanded , which implies that only a small number of storage nodes are involved in repairing a failed node .",
    "the code is called a @xmath2-ary @xmath21 lrc with all symbol locality @xmath0 or a @xmath0-local lrc for brevity if all the @xmath22 symbols have locality @xmath0 .",
    "the singleton - like bound of the minimum distance @xmath23 for an @xmath24 lrc @xcite said that @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the ceiling function .",
    "the codes meeting the above bound ( [ singleton ] ) are called optimal @xmath0-local lrcs .",
    "various constructions of optimal @xmath0-local lrcs were obtained recently , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "for a given finite field with size @xmath2 , the code length @xmath22 was not larger than @xmath2 in all the known constructions except the ones in @xcite where the minimum distance @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "cyclic lrcs were studied very recently .",
    "goparaju and calderbank @xcite constructed new families of binary cyclic codes that have an optimal dimension for given minimum distance @xmath23 and locality @xmath0 , including @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite analyzed the locality of many traditional cyclic codes , e.g. , hamming code , simplex codes , and bch codes .",
    "constructions of optimal cyclic codes in terms of the dimension for given distance and length over small field were discussed in @xcite .",
    "tamo , barg , goparaju and calderbank @xcite focused on the cyclic lrcs in terms of their zeros . a class of optimal @xmath2-ary cyclic lrcs with length @xmath12 were then constructed by analyzing the structure of zeros of reed - solomon codes and cyclic lrcs .",
    "they also studied the upper bound of the locality parameter @xmath0 for the subfield subcodes of cyclic lrcs , which was equivalent to estimate the dual distance @xmath31 .",
    "when some of the @xmath0 repairing symbols are also erased , the @xmath0-local lrc can not accomplish the local repair , which leads to the concept of @xmath1-locality .",
    "@xcite addressed the situation of multiple device failures and gave a kind of generalization of @xmath0-local lrcs . according to @xcite , the @xmath7th symbol @xmath17 of a @xmath2-ary",

    "note that when @xmath11 , the notion of locality in @xcite reduces to the notion of locality in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a class of optimal @xmath5-lrcs with length @xmath38 were obtained for @xmath39 , and there exist optimal @xmath5-lrcs when @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "an algebraic construction of optimal @xmath5-lrcs with @xmath42 was proposed in @xcite based on polynomial evaluations . by studying the structure of matroid represented by the optimal lrc s generator matrix",

    "based on a known optimal @xmath5-lrc , @xcite obtained more optimal @xmath5-lrcs by lengthening or shortening . to the best of our knowledge , the existing results on cyclic @xmath5 lrcs are limited to the special case of @xmath11 or the cyclic @xmath0-local lrcs stated in the last paragraph .",
    "there are also other generalizations of @xmath0-local lrcs , e.g. , the vector codes with locality @xcite-@xcite , and the @xmath45-available-@xmath0-local or @xmath46 lrcs @xcite-@xcite .",

    "there has been a famous problem for a long time related to the mds conjecture @xcite : for the given finite field size @xmath2 and dimension @xmath19 , find the largest value of @xmath22 for which there exists a non - trivial @xmath2-ary mds code with length @xmath22 .",
    "although there is no answer to it up to now , the evidence seems to suggest that the largest value of @xmath22 is actually @xmath15 @xcite .",

    "moreover , we obtain a class of new optimal cyclic @xmath1-lrcs ( @xmath6 ) with longer length @xmath13 based on the berlekamp - justesen codes , while the case of @xmath11 indicates the @xmath0-local lrcs with length @xmath13 . comparing with the corresponding mds codes",

    "the length @xmath22 is not greater than the given size @xmath2 of finite field @xmath18 when the minimum distance is larger than @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the proposed optimal constructions address the problem of constructing longer optimal lrcs restricted by the size of the alphabet , and could provide optimal lrcs with length @xmath14 greater than @xmath2 for any given finite field with size @xmath2 .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives some preliminaries on cyclic codes , mds codes and some results of cyclic @xmath0-local lrcs in @xcite . in section [ q-1 ] , by generalizing the construction of optimal cyclic @xmath0-local lrcs in @xcite , we construct a class of optimal cyclic @xmath5-lrcs with length @xmath47 and its factors . in section [ q+1 ] ,",

    "actually , due to the results in @xcite , when @xmath2 is odd and @xmath22 is a factor of @xmath15 , nontrivial cyclic @xmath3 $ ] mds codes over @xmath18 do not exist if both @xmath22 and @xmath19 are even .",
    "these cyclic mds codes with length @xmath15 were the known nontrivial constructions with largest length for a given @xmath2 . although cyclic mds codes with length @xmath13 over @xmath18 can be regarded as subfield subcodes of a reed - solomon code with length @xmath66 over @xmath67 , the structure of zeros of the cyclic mds code with length @xmath13 over @xmath18 is of much interest and should be carefully divided into several cases , which is listed in detail as follows .",
