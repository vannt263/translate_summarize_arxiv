    "surfactant molecules self assemble into mesoscale structures ( characteristic lengths are in the order of hundreds of nanometer ) when their concentration in an aqueous solvent exceeds a threshold value , generally called the critical micelle concentration ( cmc ) . examples of these mesoscale entities include simple structures like a monolayer of surfactants at the air - water / air - oil interface or more complex structures like a micelle and a bilayer of surfactants in the bulk . the stability of a given mesoscale structure is in turn is governed by the geometry and chemistry of the individual surfactant molecules  @xcite .",
    "characteristic energies of a self assembled surfactant interface are comparable to the thermal energy @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath2 is the equilibrium temperature , and a result the spatial organization of the molecules , which is characterized at the mesoscale by the morphology and topology of the interface , is susceptible to thermal fluctuations in the solvent .    a similar but a more complex system that is of importance to cell biology is the lipid bilayer membrane , formed by the self assembly of lipid molecules , which defines the outer boundaries of most mammalian cells and their organelles .",
    "lipid molecules are fatty acids synthesized within the cell and like a surfactant molecule they also have a hydrophilic head group and a hydrophobic tail commonly occurring lipids include glycerol based lipids such as dopc , dops and dope , sterol based lipids like cholesterol , and ceramide based lipids like sphingomyelin  @xcite .",
    "the cell membrane is formed by the self assembly of these different types of lipid molecules along with other constituents namely proteins and carbohydrates , and the composition of these building blocks differ across different cell membranes  @xcite .",
    "being the interface of the cell , the lipid membrane plays a dominant role in a number of biophysical processes either by virtue of its surface chemistry at the molecular scale or through modulations in its physical properties at the mesoscale : the most obvious examples of the latter include inter- and intra - cellular trafficking  @xcite , membrane mediated aggregation of cell signaling molecules  @xcite and cell motility  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is natural to expect an inherent feedback between the physical properties of the cell membrane and the biophysical processes it mediates .",
    "the primary aim of this article is to review theoretical and computational approaches at the mesoscale that can be used to develop an understanding of this feedback . in particular , our focus is to show how thermodynamic free energy methods employed in a variety in a contexts in condensed matter physics can be applied to the theoretical models for membranes at the mesoscale .    in equilibrium statistical mechanics , the ground state of a system",
    "whose intensive or extensive variables are coupled to the environment , and hence can exchange for instance heat or area or volume or number with the bath , is governed by its thermodynamic potential which is also called the free energy of the system .",
    "the various thermodynamic observables can be determined by measuring the suitable thermodynamic potential that depends on the ensemble in which the system is defined  @xcite .",
    "excellent introduction to the implementations and applications of the various free energy methods for molecular systems is provided by frenkel and smit  @xcite .",
    "the spatial and temporal resolution of the various biophysical processes observed in cell membranes can be classified into two broad classes , namely ( a ) biochemical processes in which the dynamics of the system is primarily determined by the chemistry of the constituent molecules and ( b ) biophysical processes where collective phenomena and macroscopic physics govern the behavior of the membrane .",
    "these two class of processes have disparate time and length scales .",
    "the large separation in the time and length scales allows one to decouple the slower degrees of freedom from the faster ones and this feature can be exploited in constructing physical models at multiple scales for the cell membrane .",
    "molecular scale models such as all - atom or coarse grained molecular dynamics are faithful to the underlying chemistry and are hence more appropriate for investigating membrane processes in the sub cellular length and nanoscopic time scales . in the other limit ,",
    "phenomenology based field theoretic models neglect the membrane dynamics at the nanoscale and instead focus on how the collective effects of these molecular motions manifest at length and time scales comparable to those accessed in conventional experiments like light microscopy and mechanical measurements of cells .",
    "more rigorous discussions on the formulation of multiscale models for membranes can found in a number of review articles on this topics  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we will use the thermodynamic formalism of membrane biophysics to demonstrate how free energy methods can extended to the study of diverse class of problems involving the cell membrane at the mesoscale .",
    "the phenomenology based approach focuses primarily on the conformational states of the bilayer membrane at length scales ( @xmath3 nm ) that are large compared to the thickness of the membrane ( @xmath4 5 nm ) . in this approach",
    "the membrane is treated as a thin elastic sheet of a highly viscous fluid with nearly constant surface area ( the number of lipids under consideration is assumed to be constant ) .",
    "this sheet is representative of the neutral surface of a membrane bilayer : it is defined as the cross sectional surface in which the in - plane strains are zero upon a bending transformation , see references  @xcite for details .",
    "the thermodynamic weights of the conformational state of the membrane is governed by the well known canham - helfrich energy functional  @xcite commonly written as , @xmath5 if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the principal curvatures at every point on the membrane surface @xmath8 then @xmath9 and @xmath10 are its mean and gaussian curvatures respectively .",
    "the elastic moduli @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the isotropic and deviatoric bending moduli .",
    "experimental measurements on lipid and cell membranes have estimated their bending stiffness @xmath11 to be in the range @xmath13 , with the lower values corresponding to model membrane structures like giant uni - lamellar vesicles .",
    "the deviatoric modulus is normally taken to @xmath14 but the gaussian energy term can be neglected , by virtue of the gauss - bonnet theorem  @xcite if the topology of the membrane does not change during the analysis .",
    "the surface area of the membrane @xmath15 and the volume @xmath16 are coupled to their respective conjugate variables namely the surface tension @xmath17 and osmotic pressure @xmath18 .",
    "reported values of membrane surface tension ( combined contributions from both the lipids and the underlying cytoskeleton ) varies between 3300 @xmath19n / m depending on the cell type  @xcite .",
    "the osmotic pressure difference @xmath18 is a function of the difference in the osmolyte concentration between the inside and outside of the cell .",
    "the spontaneous curvature @xmath20 denotes an induced curvature which can arise in a number of context such as defects in lipid packing , the presence of intrinsic degrees of freedom in the constituent lipids , interactions of the membrane with non - lipid molecules like proteins or nanoparticles and also due to the coupling of the membrane with the underlying cytoskeleton . since the spontaneous curvature is an important parameter in most of our discussions later , it is important to have a closer look at how its impacts the conformational states of the membrane . when @xmath21 , the energy given by the first term in eqn .",
    "is quadratic in the mean curvature @xmath22 and hence the probability of finding a membrane conformation with a given curvature @xmath23 is a gaussian peaked around @xmath24 , with its width being proportional to the bending stiffness @xmath11  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when the membrane has a non - zero spontaneous curvature the peak of the probability distribution now shifts to a value @xmath25 and as a result highly curved membrane regions are observed with much larger probabilities .    for purposes of computer simulations , a number of discretizations based on eqn .",
    "have been introduced in the literature .",
    "the free energy methods for membranes presented in the later sections are based on the dynamical triangulation monte carlo technique which has been reviewed in brief below .",
    "the two dimensional membrane surface is discretized into an interconnected set of @xmath2 triangles that intersect at @xmath26 vertices ( _ nodes _ ) forming @xmath27 independent links .",
    "the values of @xmath26 , @xmath2 , and @xmath27 define the topology of the membrane surface in terms of euler characteristic as @xmath28 .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the discretized membrane are the position vectors of the @xmath26 vertices given by @xmath29 $ ] and the triangulation map given by @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the discrete form of the elastic hamiltonian is thus a sum over the curvature energies at every vertex in the triangulated surface given by , @xmath31 the index @xmath32 denotes a vertex on the triangulated surface and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively its principal curvatures , @xmath35 is the local spontaneous curvature , and @xmath36 denotes the surface area associated with the vertex .",
    "the principal curvatures are computed using the methods introduced by ramakrishnan et .",
    "the spontaneous curvature at a vertex is expressed using the general form : @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the magnitude of the induced curvature and @xmath39 the functional form of the curvature contribution at vertex @xmath40 due to a curvature field at vertex @xmath32 .",
    "the various forms of @xmath39 relevant in different contexts have been discussed in references  @xcite . in this article , we limit our discussions on curvature induced membrane remodeling to protein that have isotropic curvature fields with a gaussian profile : @xmath41 here @xmath42 denotes the range of a curvature field , i.e. a curvature field defined at a vertex @xmath32 can induce a non - zero spontaneous curvature at a far vertex @xmath40 .",

    "as noted in the introduction , the thermodynamic free energy of a system is a fundamental quantity in equilibrium statistical mechanics since it contains all the information about the thermodynamic variables of the system .",
    "however , the free energy landscape of many body systems is a very complex quantity and the complexity arises primarily from the large number of degrees of freedom associated with such systems   for example an @xmath26 particle system in one dimensions has a conformational free energy landscape that is @xmath26 dimensional . in most problems in condensed matter physics , computational biology , and computational chemistry",
    "the free energy landscape in the conformational space of the atoms / molecules is an over representation of the system and hence the problem of large number of dimensions can be overcome through coarse graining or representing the system in terms of a fewer macroscopic variables generally called order parameters .",

    ", we will describe three different methods namely the widom insertion , thermodynamic integration ( ti ) , and bennett acceptance method ( bam ) to essentially perform the same calculation   to compute @xmath60 , the free energy difference between a membrane with @xmath52 and @xmath61 proteins .",
    "the widom particle or test - particle insertion method is a computational technique to probe the chemical potential of a system @xcite .",
    "it is known from statistical mechanics that the total chemical potential of a system is defined as the change in its free energy in response to a change in the system size . in the case of membrane - protein systems ,",
    "the total chemical potential of the membrane with @xmath52 proteins ( @xmath62 ) is essentially the required free energy difference , i.e. @xmath63 .    the total chemical potential can be separated into an ideal and an excess part such that @xmath64    the excess part of the chemical potential @xmath65 can be computed using widom insertion technique in which a virtual test(ghost ) protein field is inserted at a randomly chosen location on the membrane .",
    "the configurational component of the ideal part can be shown to be @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the protein density .",
    "if @xmath68 be the change in the elastic energy due to the insertion of a test protein field then the excess chemical potential is given by , @xmath69 the ensemble average @xmath70 is taken over the configurational space of the partition function , see eqn .  .",

    "the integral over @xmath75 amounts to the sum over all widom test particle / field insertion trials , and @xmath74 equals the reciprocal of the total number of trials . for conciseness , we represent the right - hand - side term in equation   as @xmath76 and here the subscript @xmath52 denotes that the ensemble average is taken on a membrane with @xmath52 proteins .",
    "the form of the excess chemical potential given in eqn .   has been derived by treating all insertion sites on the membrane to be homogeneous , while the local excess chemical potential which depends on the spatial location @xmath77 on the membrane surface is given by , @xmath78 in eqn .  , @xmath79 denotes the change in energy due to the insertion of a protein field at spatial location @xmath77 .",
    "the inhomogeneous chemical potential and the spatially uniform chemical potential @xmath65 can be used to determine the inhomogeneous , scaled spatial density of the proteins using the relation : @xmath80      thermodynamic integration is perturbative technique that can be used to determine the relative free energy difference between any two thermodynamic states @xmath15 and @xmath81 , provided there exists a continuous path @xmath82 that connects state @xmath15 to @xmath81 ; in the context of protein induced membrane remodeling the states @xmath15 and @xmath81 correspond to a membrane with @xmath52 and @xmath61 proteins respectively . if @xmath83 and @xmath84 be the energies of these two states then the various intermediate states of the membrane along the path @xmath82 can be obtained by varying the coupling parameter @xmath85 such that the energy of any intermediate state is given by @xmath86 , subject to the boundary condition @xmath87 and @xmath88 . the energy of an intermediate state with a given value of @xmath89 can be expressed in terms of the energies of the end states as  @xcite : @xmath90    the free - energy change along this path can expressed in its integral form as , @xmath91 using the definitions of the partition function and the free energy , given in eqns .   and  , in the above equation",

    "is estimated from independent simulations of the system at pre - determined , sufficiently small intervals of @xmath89 and the relative free energy @xmath94 is then estimated through numerical integration of eqn .  .",
    "bennett acceptance method is another perturbative technique that can be used to approximate the free - energy difference between two states close to each other in their conformational space  @xcite .",
    "the microscopic reversibility for the transition of the membrane - protein system between the two states with @xmath52 and @xmath61 proteins , also called detailed balance condition , can be stated as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is some function that defines the distribution of the acceptance probability for a transition of the membrane from a state with @xmath52 proteins to a state with @xmath61 proteins and vice versa .",

    "[ fig : tether - pmf - force ] : ( i ) an initial weakly linear regime ( @xmath178 ) , ( ii ) an intermediate quadratic regime ( @xmath179 ) , and ( iii ) a final linear regime ( @xmath180 .",
    "these three regimes have a significance in the formation and stabilization of the membrane tether . when a force is applied to an undulating membrane the short wavelength undulations in the membrane conformation",
    "are suppressed in the linear response regime and this response characterizes the initial linear regime .",
    "the tubular structures nucleate and grow in the intermediate quadratic regime until all the undulations in the membrane are ironed out and are drawn into the tubular region   the extent of the quadratic regime changes with change in the membrane excess area which sets the intensities of the characteristic undulations in the membrane  @xcite . in the final linear regime the tether does not extends considerably and all the applied force ( i.e. the biasing potential in the current context ) is primarily used to stabilize the length of membrane tether and this leads to reduced undulations in the tether length which is seen in the narrow distribution of @xmath154 at large values of @xmath174 .",
    "the force required to extract a tether can be determined from the pmf as @xmath181 .",
    "numerical differentiation of the pmf can lead to large errors in the estimates for the tether force and hence we use an alternate method where we utilize the scaling relations to determine @xmath182 .",

    "the pmf of a system determined using wham analysis is accurate only upto an additive constant , as shown in eqn .  , and hence can only be used to determine the relative energy differences between the various states .",
    "furthermore , the umbrella sampling technique and wham also suffer from the problem of _ end - point - catastrophe _ , which is a well known phenomenon in alchemical energy methods commonly used to study the free energy landscapes of biomolecular systems .",
    "in such systems , the free energy estimates close to the end points of the order parameter are erroneous due to the numerical instabilities arising from the divergence of the interaction potential   a case point being the free energy calculation involving two atoms , interacting via a lennard - jones potential , with their separation @xmath184 .",
    "wham also suffers from such shortcomings at the end points albeit for a different reason .",
    "an end point is defined as the value of the order parameter beyond which the potential of mean force vanishes since the various underlying interaction potentials vanish . in this regime , where the strength of the pmf is very weak ( compared to the strength of the fluctuations ) , the signal to noise ratio is very small and hence conventional sampling techniques do not yield the correct probability distribution for the order parameter in the windows close to the end point . as a result the pmf computed using wham does not accurately capture the energy landscape of the system close to the end point .",
    "the problem of end - point - catastrophe can be overcome either by generating infinitely long samples or by performing the simulations using a stronger biasing potential with much smaller window sizes and both these methods leads to large computational costs .",
    "a similar method has been discussed in the context of solvation free energies by souaille and roux  @xcite .    in certain class of problems ,",
    "the thermodynamic integration technique can be used to overcome the end - point - catastrophe mentioned above and also fix the absolute energy levels for the pmf .",
    "we demonstrate the idea of bridging the free energies computed using wham and ti using the case of a functionalized nanocarrier interacting with receptor molecules expressed on the surface of a flat membrane .",
    "we follow the model previously described by liu et al  @xcite to construct the free energy landscape for the interaction of an anti - icam functionalized nanocarrier with a membrane surface expressing icam receptors . in brief , the nanocarrier is a sphere of radius 50 nm , discretized into 162 vertices , and is functionalized with antibodies , that are represented as radial vectors of length 15 nm .",
    "the membrane is represented as a planar substrate on which the receptors molecules are modeled as cylinders of length 19 nm and radius 1.5 nm .",
    "the interaction between the tip of an antibody and the tip of a surface receptor is modeled as a bell bond with a potential : @xmath185 @xmath186 is the activation energy gained by the system when a bond is formed , @xmath187 is the strength of receptor - antibody bond , @xmath188 is the distance between the tips of the antibody and receptor molecules .",
    "@xmath189 denotes the maximum extension of the antibody - receptor bonds and the bonds break when @xmath190 .",

    "hence we take the region around @xmath20384.4 nm to represent the regime corresponding to the end point catastrophe .",
    "the conformations of a nanocarrier with one , two , and three simultaneous bonds obtained at different values of the reaction coordinates are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wham - ti](a ) ( the unbound antibodies and receptors are not shown for clarity ) .",

    "[ fig : wham - ti](b ) for four different ensembles of the nanocarrier - membrane system .",
    "it can be seen that the potential of mean force obtained from different ensembles are shifted upto an arbitrary constant but the relative energy levels between the various states remain nearly constant , which is reflective of the first shortcoming discussed at the introduction",
    ". a closer look at the region between 84.0 and 84.4 nm reveals that the harmonic potential , characteristic of a single antibody - receptor bond with a well depth of 19@xmath0 , is only partially captured in the wham analysis and this is a clear signature of the end - point catastrophe .    on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wham - ti](c ) , the free energy difference close to the end point region computed using ti coupled with wham precisely captures both the non - bonded region ( @xmath20284.4 nm ) and also the depth of potential well corresponding to a single bond .",
    "these results were obtained using short ti calculations performed in the end point region with an window interval of 0.1 nm .",
    "since the bonded and unbonded states are clearly defined the relative free energy computed using ti can be combined with pmf computed using wham to fix the end - point - catastrophe and also represent the pmf in an absolute scale .",
    "the absolute potential of mean force ( @xmath204 ) obtained by shifting @xmath197 with respect to @xmath200 through a linear regression fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wham - ti](d ) .",
    "the absolute pmf obtained by combining wham and ti is in excellent agreement with the reported values of the pmf obtained by grafting the end points using an analytic function  @xcite .",
    "the bridging technique presented here is very generic and can be applied to even more complex scenarios where the exact form of the analytic function as a function of the order parameter is not known .",
    "the analysis of the thermodynamic free energy landscape can yield unprecedented levels of insight into the behavior of complex systems .",
    "however , it is a challenge in the study of these systems to formulate computational methods to delineate their free energy landscape using physically relevant order parameters .",
    "the primary focus of this article is to demonstrate how conventional free energy methods can be adopted to in problems related to morphological transitions in cell membrane .",
    "quantitative predictions based on the relative free energies obtained using these simple but elegant methods reproduce many of the emergent behaviors observed in experiments . since these methods provide a powerful framework to interpret experimental findings it is essential to develop free energy based models and methods which help in understanding the system at a more fundamental level .",
