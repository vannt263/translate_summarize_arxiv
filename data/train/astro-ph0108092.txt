    "measuring atmospheric cherenkov radiation is presently the most effective way to detect cosmic @xmath3-rays with primary energies between about 100 gev and 1 tev ( @xcite ) . in order to reach low energy thresholds with techniques based on cherenkov light ,",
    "large mirror collection areas are needed .",
    "graal is an experiment that employs the large mirror area of an existing tower solar - power plant for this purpose .",
    "cesa-1 is a heliostat field comprising of 225 steerable mirrors to the north of a central tower located within the `` plataforma solar de almera''(psa ) , a solar thermal - energy research centre located in the desert of tabernas ( 37@xmath10.095 n , 2@xmath10.360 w ) at a height a.s.l . of 505 m.",
    "the 63 heliostats used for graal have a mirror area of 39.7 m@xmath1 each and have a roughly spherical shape .",
    "+ the heliostats focus the cherenkov light of airshowers from the direction of potential gamma - ray sources to software adjustable `` aiming points '' in the central tower ( see fig.[tower ] ) .",
    "cherenkov light from four groups of heliostats ( with 13,14,18,18 members , respectively ) is directed onto four single non - imaging `` cone concentrators '' ( truncated winston cones with an opening angle of 10@xmath10 ) each containing a single large - area pmt .",
    "they are housed in a special enclosure that is fastened to the outside of the central tower at a height of 70 m. the incoming light from an air shower consists of a train of pulses from the different heliostats , usually fully separated by pathlength differences . the arrival time and amplitude of each heliostat",
    "can thus be determined with a flash - adc in a sequential mode .",
    "+ compared to the three other heliostat field experiments ( `` celeste''(@xcite),``stacee''(@xcite ) and `` solar 2 '' ( @xcite ) ) which focus the light of single heliostats onto related single pmt s , the night sky background ( nsb ) per channel is about a factor 10 higher in graal ( 8 - 10 p.e./ns ) .",
    "this leads to a higher energy threshold .",
    "the advantage of the non - imaging approach is its greater simplicity leading to cost savings by about a factor 5 - 10 in hardware costs .",
    "the presence of only four data - acquisition channels makes automatization and remote control more feasible , leading to comparable savings in operation costs . in the non - imaging approach it is impossible to avoid a temporal overlap of the signal from certain heliostats depending on the pointing direction",
    "this reduces the number of times / amplitudes usable in the reconstruction by about 20 @xmath11 . on the positive side ,",
    "calibration is easier when signals from several heliostats are measured in the same pmt .",
    "+ we register all four pulse trains in only one digital oscilloscope with a bandwidth of 1 ghz and a time bin of 500 psec .",
    "this ensures that the fwhm of individual pulses of about 3.6 nsec is negligibly increased by electronics effects .",
    "the time and amplitude calibration of our setup is performed using blue leds with a calibrator module that is fastened at the window of the winston cones .",
    "+ all operations ( like opening of the door , high - voltage control etc . ) at the central receiver and the tracking of the heliostat field are under remote control via the internet . under conditions that indicate some malfunction , a physicist on shift",
    "is phoned by the pc and can check all parameters and images of web cameras , remotely . for the operation of the heliostat field and emergencies only the regular night - operator of the psa is on - site in all observation nights .",
    "graal is taking data continously since august 1999 ( since march 2000 in the final hardware configuration ) . here",
    "we present data for the observation year 1999/2000 of the crab nebula .",
    "the different arrival times of the signals from the individual heliostats were used to reconstruct the timing shower front of the individual events .",
    "the expected arrival times for all heliostats in each of the four cones were calculated and stored in a `` library '' for a 5 @xmath5 5 degree grid centered to a direction about 1 degree offset from the current pointing direction of the heliostats .",
    "the offset was chosen to avoid a bias towards `` correct pointing '' .",
    "this calculation was performed assuming a point - like shower - maximum at a penetration depth of 230 g / cm@xmath1 ( the mean penetration of showers induced by a photon of 100 gev ) in the pointing direction .",
    "a spherical timing - front was assumed to be emitted by this maximum .",
    "the shower core was fixed at the geometrical centre of the field as defined by the used heliostats ( it was verified that this assumption introduces no bias ) .",
    "+ the measured arrival times were compared to the `` library '' .",
    "we define the time difference timediff @xmath13 the direction yielding the smallest @xmath14 with @xmath15 was chosen as the final reconstructed direction of the shower .",
    "+ fig.[angproj ] shows projections of reconstructed directions in zenith and azimuth angle both for on and off source directions for a large data sample .",
    "the origin corresponds to the pointing direction determined by the heliostat tracking .",
    "the directions of events in the `` smooth background '' extending to large off - axis angles were found to be systematically misreconstructed .",
    "this effect was used in the later analysis to normalise on and off rates .",
    "+     0.05@xmath10.,width=313 ]    if the `` misreconstructed '' directions are excluded , the angular resolution @xmath16 ( the opening angle within which 63 @xmath11 of all events are contained ) is 0.7@xmath10 .",
    "from a total measuring time of 32 hours , only nights in which all four detector channels and the heliostats in the field were functioning normally according to the recorded monitor files were chosen for further analysis .",
    "furthermore , only data taken in `` good nights '' , i.e. , with no clouds , low humidity , no dust , remained after our cuts .",
    "these `` meteorological cuts '' are severe under the weather conditions at the psa . in the data sample on crab in february / march 2000 only 22 @xmath11 of all data taken on",
    "the crab pulsar passed all cuts .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + in an alternative approach the software analysis rejects accidental events due to the low number of peaks and uncorrelated times of the peaks of such events .",
    "less than 0.6@xmath11 of the accidental events pass the analysis for a very similar nsb to the one of crab sample . in our analysis",
    ", a higher nsb rejects more accidental events . as seen in the column 5 of table [ crabresult ] also here there is no significant excess in the total rate .",
    "this lack of an excess in the total rate seems to cast a doubt on the reality of the signal discussed in section [ results ] .",
    "the results of the present measurements do not prove that the use of an heliostat array in gamma - ray astronomy is a feasible alternative to the use of dedicated cherenkov telescopes .",
    "+ the principle drawbacks of this approach were found to be the restricted field of view and the weather conditions at the relatively low elevation of the heliostat field .",
    "the field - of view restriction leads to a very similar time structure of the shower front in proton and gamma induced showers and biases the direction reconstruction based in timing towards to the pointing direction .",
    "both effects together prevent any efficient separation of proton and gamma induced showers .",
    "this makes a flux determination independent of total rates difficult ( though not impossible ) and severely limits the sensitivity of the experiment .",
    "the fraction of time ( total duty cycle ) with weather and moon - light conditions sufficient for the detection of gamma radiation was about 3 - 4 @xmath11 at the psa , about a factor of 5 lower than at astronomical sites .",
    "both drawbacks seem to be unavoidable for the heliostat - field based approach also in the future .",
    "the graal project is supported by funds from the dfg , cicyt and the ihp `` access to large scale facilities '' program of the eu .",
