    "coamoebae are cousins to amoebae , which are images of subvarieties under the coordinatewise logarithm map @xmath0 .",
    "amoebae were introduced by gelfand , kapranov , and zelevinsky in 1994  @xcite , and have subsequently been widely studied  @xcite .",
    "coamoebae were introduced by passare in a talk in 2004 , and they appear to have many beautiful and interesting properties .",
    "for example , coamoebae of @xmath1-discriminants in dimension two are unions of two non - convex polyhedra  @xcite , and a hypersurface coamoeba has an associated arrangement of codimension one tori contained in its closure  @xcite .",
    "bergman  @xcite introduced the logarithmic limit set @xmath2 of a subvariety @xmath3 of the torus as the set of limiting directions of points in its amoeba .",
    "bieri and groves  @xcite showed that @xmath2 is a rational polyhedral complex in the sphere .",
    "logarithmic limit sets are now called tropical algebraic varieties  @xcite . for a hypersurface @xmath4 , logarithmic limit set @xmath5 consists of the directions of non - maximal cones in the outer normal fan of the newton polytope of @xmath6 .",
    "we introduce a similar object for coamoebae and establish a structure theorem for coamoebae similar to that of bergman and of bieri and groves for amoebae .    let be the coamoeba of a subvariety @xmath3 of @xmath7 with ideal @xmath8 .",
    "the of @xmath3 , , is the set of accumulation points of arguments of sequences in @xmath3 with unbounded logarithm . for @xmath9 , the initial variety",
    "@xmath10 is the variety of the initial ideal of @xmath8 .",
    "the fundamental theorem of tropical geometry asserts that @xmath11 exactly when the direction of @xmath12 lies in @xmath2 .",
    "we establish its analog for coamoebae .",
    "[ t : one ] the closure of @xmath13 is @xmath14 , and @xmath15    johansson  @xcite used different methods to prove this when @xmath3 is a complete intersection .    the cone over the logarithmic limit set admits the structure of a rational polyhedral fan @xmath16 in which all weights @xmath17 in the relative interior of a cone @xmath18 give the same initial scheme @xmath19 .",
    "thus the union in theorem  [ t : one ] is finite and is indexed by the images of these cones @xmath20 in the logarithmic limit set of @xmath3 .",
    "the logarithmic limit set or tropical algebraic variety is a combinatorial shadow of @xmath3 encoding many properties of @xmath3 . while the coamoeba of @xmath3 is typically not purely combinatorial ( see the examples of lines in @xmath21 in section  [ s : lines ] ) ,",
    "the phase limit set does provide a combinatorial skeleton which we believe will be useful in the further study of coamoebae .",
    "we give definitions and background in section  [ s : defs ] , and detailed examples of lines in three - dimensional space in section  [ s : lines ] .",
