    "the research on heterostrustures that combine superconductors and ferromagnets has begun in sixties.@xcite still , the @xmath0 structures remain a subject of active experimental and theoretical investigation .",
    "new developments concern josephson , @xmath1-junctions,@xcite spin valves based on giant magnetoresistance effect,@xcite triplet superconducting ordering , @xcite andreev reflection phenomena in @xmath2 trilayers@xcite and proposed detection of electron entanglement.@xcite    near the @xmath0 interface electrons are influenced by both exchange field @xmath3 of the ferromagnet and pair potential @xmath4 of the superconductor . exchange field tends to split the density of states so that the energy bands for different spin directions are shifted in energy.@xcite besides , the exchange field at @xmath0 interfaces induces pair breaking , suppression of the spectrum gap and even formation of a superconducting gapless state.@xcite the latter is qualitatively similar to the gapless state in superconductors with paramagnetic impurities.@xcite the exchange field is also active if the ferromagnet is an insulator ( fi ) : although in this case electrons can not penetrate the ferromagnet , they pick up the exchange field while reflecting from the @xmath5 interface .",
    "@xcite this has been experimentally verified with euo - al@xmath6 al@xmath7o@xmath8 @xmath6 al junctions .",
    "@xcite    the physics of @xmath0 or @xmath5 structures is thus governed by two factors : i. electron states are modified by @xmath4 and @xmath3 , ii . the @xmath4 and @xmath3 are modified as a result of the modification of electron states by virtue of self - consistency equations . @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath3 correspond to incompatible types of ordering that suppress each other and therefore compete rather than collaborate .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that @xmath9 structures can be used to get rid of the second factor .",
    "the buffer normal metal effectively separates @xmath4 and @xmath3 in space to prevent their mutual suppression , provided its thickness exceeds the superconducting coherence length .",
    "however , the electrons in the normal do feel both superconducting and ferromagnetic correlations . varying the conductances of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 interfaces it is possible to tune the strength of these correlations .    if there are no ferromagnetic correlations , the traditional proximity effect in @xmath10 structures takes place . a @xmath10 interface couples electrons and holes in the normal metal by the coherent process of andreev reflection @xcite at energies @xmath12 , @xcite so that andreev bound states are formed.@xcite if the normal metal is connected to the bulk superconductor only , there is a ( mini ) gap in the spectrum of these states .",
    "the energy scale of the gap is not @xmath4 .",
    "rather , it is set by the inverse escape time into the superconductor , @xmath13 .",
    "this minigap was first predicted in ref . and",
    "has been intensively investigated.@xcite a common realistic assumption is that diffusive transport takes place in the normal metal .",
    "@xcite in this case , the superconducting proximity effect is described by the usadel equation .",
    "@xcite    the @xmath9 structures can be used to achieve an _",
    "absolute spin - valve effect_. @xcite the collaboration of superconducting and ferromagnetic correlations results in a spin - split bcs - like dos in the normal metal part , very much like in a bcs superconductor in the presence of the spin magnetic field .",
    "@xcite however , the effective exchange field @xmath14 and proximity gap @xmath15 characterizing the dos in this case,@xcite are parametrically different from @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the ferromagnet and superconductor .",
    "in particular , the fact that the effective exchange field @xmath14 affects electrons in all points of the normal part of a @xmath9 structure , does not imply to that the `` real '' exchange field @xmath3 in the ferromagnet penetrates into @xmath16 by an appreciable distance .",
    "actually it is known that @xmath3 only penetrates up to distances of the fermi wavelength in the normal part .",
    "rather , the effect of @xmath14 is due to the extended nature of the electron wave functions in @xmath16 , which probe the spin dependent potential at the @xmath17 interface and carry the information about this potential throughout the whole normal metal region .",
    "two such stuctures with normal metal parts connected by a tunnel junction constitute the absolute spin valve.@xcite the presence of a normal metal is essential to provide a physical separation between the sources of superconducting and magnetic correlations so that superconductivity and magnetism do not compete . the fact that the magnet is an insulator guarantees the absence of the normal electrons at the fermi level and thus enables the proximity gap . the spin - valve effect mentioned would not be absolute if the ferromagnet is a metal . in this case",
    ", there would be a finite density of states at any energy due to the possible electron escape into the ferromagnet .",
    "besides , the use of a insulator does not require nearly fully spin polarized ferromagnets ( half - metal materials ) to achieve an absolute spin - valve effect .",
    "the analysis of ref . was restricted to the so - called  circuit - theory \" limit.@xcite the variation of green functions along the normal part was disregarded .",
    "this is justified if the resistance of the normal metal part is much smaller than both the resistance of the @xmath10 interface and effective spin - mixing resistance characterizing the @xmath11 interface .    in the present paper",
    ", we extend this analysis to arbitrary resistances of the diffusive normal metal part .",
    "to do so , we analyse the solutions of one - dimensional usadel equation@xcite in the normal part .",
    "our goal is to find the gaps in the spectrum for both spin directions .",
    "the equation must be supplemented by boundary conditions at both magnetic and superconducting interfaces .",
    "microscopic models for interfaces of mesoscopic structures have been extensively studied in past years combining the scattering matrix approach and quasiclassical green s function theory.@xcite in the case of diffusive conductors the interfaces can be described in a compact / transparent way by means of `` circuit theory '' boundary conditions.@xcite in that case the interface is described by a set of conductance parameters given as certain specific combinations of the reflection and/or transmission amplitudes of the scattering matrix associated with the interface . the regime of diffusive transport considered is distinct from the ( quasi)ballistic regime assumed in many studies of @xmath0 structures .",
    "@xcite    to summarize the resuls shortly , we have shown that the effect of magnetic correlations is twofold .",
    "firstly , these correlations shift the bcs - like densities of states in energy , with shifts being opposite for opposite spin directions.@xcite in the first approximation , the absolute value of the proximity gap is not affected by the ferromagnetic insulator .",
    "secondly , we have also found that the magnetic correlations may suppres the gap .",
    "the gap completely dissapears at some critical values of the parameters .",
    "this is qualitatively different from ref . and presents the effect of the resistance of the normal metal .",
    "the mechanism of the gap suppression appears to be surprisingly similar to that due to paramagnetic impurities .",
    "@xcite at qualitative level , this has been noticed in the context of @xmath5 structures .",
    "@xcite however , for @xmath9 structures the analogy becomes closer : the gap closing in a certain limit ( see section [ sec:4sdf ] ) is described by equations identical to those of ref . .",
    "we stress that there are no magnetic impurities in our model and the quasiparticles are affected by magnetism only when they are reflected at the @xmath11 boundary .",
    "effective spin - flip time thus arises from interplay of magnetic correlations and diffusive scattering in the normal metal .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the spectrum gap suppression in @xmath9 structures is not accompanied by suppression of the pair potential , this is in distinction from the situation described in.@xcite    the structure of the article is as follows . in section [ sec:1sdf ]",
    "we introduce the basic equations and define the matrix current in the diffusive normal metal . in section [ sec:2sdf ] ,",
    "we specify the boundary conditions for the usadel equation by imposing matrix current conservation at the interfaces of our @xmath9 system . the resulting set of equations allows us to calculate the total green s function @xmath18 at any point in the diffusive wire .",
    "analytical solutions can be only found in two limiting cases ( sections [ sec:3sdf ] and [ sec:4sdf ] ) .",
    "further on , we solve numerically the equations for general values of the parameters to obtain the general boundary in parameter space that separates gap and no - gap solutions ( section [ sec:5sdf ] ) .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec:7sdf ] .",
    "let us consider a @xmath9 structure with the diffusive normal metal in the form of a slab of length @xmath19 and cross - section @xmath20 .",
    "this accounts both for sandwich @xmath21 and wire @xmath22 geometries .",
    "the usadel equation in the normal part can be presented as @xmath23   \\label{usadel}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 @xmath25 is the conductance associated with the diffusive metal , @xmath26 being its conductivity , @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the average level spacing in the metal and @xmath29 is the energy of the quasiparticles ( electrons and holes ) with respect to the fermi energy @xmath30 .",

    "note that the leakage current @xmath40 does not contribute to the nonequilibrium ( physical ) charge current , given the fact that its keldysh component is zero .",
    "this implies that the physical ( charge ) current is conserved through the system , as expected . on the other hand , the diagonal components of @xmath40 in keldysh space ( retarded and advanced components @xmath41 ) , which are proportional to the energy @xmath29 , describe decoherence between electrons and holes . by solving the usadel equation in the normal metal",
    ", we obtain the green s function @xmath31 that contains information about the equilibrium spectral properties ( @xmath42 ) and about the nonequilibrium transport properties ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "@xcite in this paper we concentrate on spectral properties of the diffusive wire , so from now on we restrict ourselves to the retarded block in keldysh space .",
    "this is denoted by @xmath44 .",

    "we demonstrate that the combined effect of a ferromagnetic insulator and the elastic scattering on the proximity gap of a diffusive wire is twofold .",

    "<S> we study the proximity effect in hybrid structures consisting of superconductor and ferromagnetic insulator separated by a normal diffusive metal ( s / n / fi structures ) . </S>",

    "<S> we pay special attention to the gaps in the density of states of the normal part . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the effect of the ferromagnet is twofold : it not only shifts the density of states but also provides suppression of the gap . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism of this suppression is remarkably similar to that due to magnetic impurities . </S>",
    "<S> our results are obtained from the solution of one - dimensional usadel equation supplemented with boundary conditions for matrix current at both interfaces . </S>"
