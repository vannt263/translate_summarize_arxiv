    "the melting curves of transition metals at pressures up to the megabar region are highly controversial , particularly for b.c.c",
    "diamond anvil cell ( dac ) measurements find that the melting temperature @xmath3 increases by only a few hundred k over the range 1 - 100 gpa  @xcite , while shock experiments indicate an increase of several thousand k over this range  @xcite .",
    "there have been several _ ab initio _",
    "calculations on transition - metal @xmath3(p ) curves , and the predictions agree more closely with the shock data than with the dac data  @xcite .",
    "a challenging case is molybdenum , where there are very large differences between dac and shock data  @xcite , and where the shock data reveal _ two _ transitions , the one at high pressure ( @xmath4 380 gpa ) being attributed to melting , and the one at low pressure ( @xmath4 210 gpa ) to a transition from b.c.c . to an unidentified structure  @xcite .",
    "we report here on new _ ab initio _ calculations of @xmath3(@xmath5 ) for mo , and on the @xmath1 and @xmath2 relations on the hugoniot .",
    "we also report preliminary information that may help in searching for the unidentified high - p solid phase of mo .",
    "we use density functional theory ( dft ) , which gives very accurate predictions for many properties of transition metals , including hugoniot curves  @xcite .",
    "dft molecular dynamics ( m.d . ) was first used to study solid - liquid equilibrium 12 years ago  @xcite , and several different techniques are now available for using it to calculate melting curves . in such calculations",
    ", no empirical model is used to describe the interactions between the atoms , but instead the full electronic structure , and hence the total energy and the forces on the atoms , is recalculated at each time step .",
    "there have been earlier dft calculations on the melting of mo , but the techniques used were prone to superheating effects  @xcite . in the present work , we use the so - called `` reference coexistence '' techniques  @xcite , which does not suffer from this problem .",
    "our work has several aims .",
    "first , we want to improve on the reliability and accuracy of the predicted melting curve of mo obtained from dft ; second , we use dft to predict the @xmath1 and @xmath2 relations on the shock hugoniot ; third , we want to identify the unknown solid phase of mo observed in shock experiments .",
    "our tests on the accuracy of dft for mo , and our extensive calculations of the mo melting curve will be reported in detail elsewhere  @xcite , so we present only a summary here . however",
    ", our very recent calculations on the shock hugoniot will be presented in more detail .",
    "these are important , because temperature is very difficult to measure in shock experiments  @xcite and dft gives a way of supplying what is missing in the shock data .",
    "our search for the unidentified solid structure of mo is at the exploratory stage , but we present results for phonon frequencies as a function of pressure , which allow us to rule out some possibilities .    in the following , we summarise our tests on the accuracy of the dft techniques ( sec .",
    "[ sec : techniques_and_tests ] ) , and outline the reference coexistence technique . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present our results for the dft melting curve and hugoniot of mo up to 400  gpa , and the study of the phonon frequencies . discussion and conclusions are in sec .",

    "our dft calculations are performed mainly with the projector augmented wave ( paw ) implementation  @xcite , using the vasp code  @xcite , since paw is known to be very accurate . the main uncontrollable approximation in dft is the form adopted for the exchange - correlation functional @xmath6 . to test the accuracy of paw , and the effect of @xmath6 ,",

    "the pressure predictions from paw using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite and local - density approximation ( lda )  @xcite forms of @xmath6 deviate by @xmath8  % in opposite directions from the experimental data , but we adopt the pbe form , because the deviations in this case are rather constant .",
    "the pbe results of fig .",
    "[ fig : wien2kvasp ] were obtained with 4s states and below in the core and all other states in the valence set .",
    "inclusion of 4s states in the valence set makes no appreciable difference to the pbe results .",
    "we also tested the paw implementation itself by repeating the @xmath1 calculations with the even more accurate full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) technique  @xcite , using the wien2k code  @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wien2kvasp ] , paw and fp - lapw results are almost identical . further confirmation for the accuracy of the paw implementation and the pbe functional comes from our comparisons of the calculated phonon dispersion relations for the ambient - pressure b.c.c .",

    "[ fig : vaspphonon ] ) .    the `` reference coexistence '' technique for calculating _",
    "ab initio _ melting curves has been described elsewhere  @xcite , but we recall the main steps .",
    "first , an empirical reference model is fitted to dft m.d .",
    "simulations of the solid and liquid at thermodynamic states close to the expected melting curve .",
    "then , the reference model is used to perform simulations on large systems in which solid and liquid coexist , to obtain points on the melting curve of the model . in crucial third stage ,",
    "differences between the reference and dft total energy functions are used to correct the melting properties of the reference model , to obtain the _ ab initio _ melting curve . in the present work ,",
    "the total energy function of the reference model is represented by the embedded - atom model ( eam )  @xcite , consisting of a repulsive inverse - power pair potential , and an embedding term describing the d - band bonding . the detailed procedure for fitting @xmath9 to dft m.d .",
    "data will be reported elsewhere  @xcite , but we note that we needed to re - fit the model in different pressure ranges .    the simulations on solid and liquid mo in stable thermodynamic coexistence using the fitted reference model employed systems of 6750 atoms , and",
    "we checked that the results do not change if even larger systems are used .",
    "the protocols for preparing these simulated systems , and for achieving and monitoring stable coexistence were similar to those used in earlier work on the melting curve of cu  @xcite .",
    "the procedures for correcting the melting curve of the reference model , which depend on calculations of the the free energy differences between the reference and dft systems , have been described and validated in earlier work  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : melting ] shows the melting curve of our reference eam model , and the melting curve obtained from this by correcting for the differences between the dft and reference total - energy functions ; earlier _ ab initio_-based calculations of the mo melting curve due to moriarty and to belonoshko _",
    "_ are also indicated  @xcite .",
    "we also show points on the melting curve from dac and shock measurements  @xcite . the differences between reference and corrected melting curves are only a few hundred k , so that the corrected curve should be very close to the melting curve that would be obtained from the ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional if no statistical - mechanical approximations were made . because we avoid approximations of earlier _",
    "ab initio_-based work , our present results should be a more accurate representation of the dft melting curve . up to 100  gpa , the differences between our results and earlier dft work are rather small , and we confirm that dft gives a much higher melting slope than that given by dac experiments .",
    "we obtain an accurate value of @xmath10 at @xmath11 by fitting our melting curve to the simon equation @xmath12 , with @xmath13  k , @xmath14  gpa , @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting @xmath11 value of @xmath16  k is close to the accepted experimental value @xmath17  k. our @xmath10 value of @xmath18  k  gpa@xmath19 at @xmath11 agrees with an older experimental value of @xmath20  k  gpa@xmath19  @xcite .",
    "our dft melting curve is consistent with the point obtained at @xmath21  gpa from shock measurements .",
    "however , we stress that the temperature of the `` experimental '' point was not measured , but estimated by considering superheating corrections to the shock - wave data  @xcite . because of this , it is important to try and corroborate the estimated experimental temperature , and this can be done by _ ab initio _ calculations , as we explain next .",

    "we find that temperature neither favours any of them respect to b.c.c .",
    ", thus they must be excluded as well .",
    "recently , a 2nd - order phase transition from cubic to rhombohedral has been observed in vanadium at @xmath60  gpa  @xcite .",
    "this appears to be related to an earlier _ ab initio _ prediction of a phonon softening in v  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a similar structural transition might occur in mo .",
    "we have used our calculated phonon dispersion relations of mo over the range @xmath0  gpa to test this .",
    "[ fig : freqcomp ] depicts our results at 0 , 77 , 136 , 274 and 400  gpa , but we see that no phonon anomaly like that reported for v is observed at any wavevector .",

    "an important outcome of the present work is improved dft calculations of the melting curve of mo over the pressure range @xmath0  gpa . in particular ,",
    "our techniques allow us to avoid the superheating errors which appear to affect an independent recent dft study of mo melting  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of our calculations is confirmed by the very close agreement with experiment for the melting temperature @xmath3 and the melting slope @xmath10 at ambient pressure .",
    "the results fully confirm that the increase of @xmath3 by @xmath61  k over the range @xmath62  gpa predicted by dft is about 10 greater than that deduced from dac measurements .",
    "a second important outcome is that our calculations of the temperature along the shock hugoniot support earlier temperature estimates based on experimental data but corrected for possible superheating effects  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to compare more confidently the point on the melting curve at @xmath63  gpa derived from shock data with our predicted melting curve , and we confirm that @xmath3 at this pressure is _ ca .",
    "_ 8650  k. this is far above any reasonable extrapolation of the dac data . concerning the search for the unknown crystal structure of mo indicated by shock experiments to exist above _ ca . _",

    "our calculations of the phonon dispersion realations in the b.c.c .",
    "structure over the range @xmath0  gpa reveal no softening of any phonons , and no indication of any elastic instability .",
    "this means that the new crystal structure does not arise from small distortion of b.c.c .",
    "this is interesting in the light of the recent discovery of the elastic instability of b.c.c .",
    "v above @xmath64  gpa , predicted initially by dft , and observed very recently in x - ray diffraction experiments  @xcite .",
    "it seems that the structural transition in mo is of a different kind .",
    "the large conflict between the melting curve of mo derived from dac measurements on one side and from shock experiments and dft calculations on the other side must be due either to a misinterpretation of the dac data or to a combination of serious dft errors and misinterpretation of shock data . given the accuracy of dft that we have been able to demonstrate ( low - temperature @xmath1 curve , hugoniot @xmath1 curve , ambient-@xmath5 phonons ) , we think there is little evidence for significant errors in dft , which is also in good accord with shock data .",
    "a possible explanation might be that the large temperature gradients and non - hydrostatic stress in dac experiments might give rise to flow of material giving the appearance of melting , even well below the thermodynamic melting temperature .",
    "we also note recent evidence that temperature measurement in dac experiments may be subject to previously unsuspected errors  @xcite , though probably not of the size needed to resolve the conflict by themselves .",
