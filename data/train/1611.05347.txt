    "the propagation of cosmic rays through the heliosphere is affected by the large - scale interplanetary magnetic field , and the turbulent fluctuations superposed on it .",
    "understanding the nature of the effect of these fields on particle transport is necessary , as we want to understand the sources and acceleration processes of different cosmic ray populations .",
    "the turbulent fluctuations in the interplanetary magnetic field can be considered as scattering agents for the cosmic rays , prompting the description of their propagation as random - walk .",
    "@xcite used this concept to describe the propagation of cosmic rays in the time - asymptotic limit as diffusion . determining the connection between the turbulence properties and the diffusion coefficients , however , has proven to be a difficult task .",
    "@xcite considered a quasi - linear approach , where the transport along the mean field direction was affected by fluctuations of the scale of the particle s larmor radius , whereas the propagation across the mean field was caused by the random walk experienced by the magnetic field lines due to turbulent fluctuations .",
    "the field line random walk ( flrw ) model has since been extended to consider the compound effect of the particles scattering along the random - walking field lines @xcite , and the most advanced models generally compare well with full - orbit simulations @xcite and some cosmic ray observations @xcite .",
    "the particle cross - field diffusion has also been applied in modelling solar energetic particle ( sep ) propagation in the heliosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent sep observations , however , have proved difficult to reconcile with the models . the solar wind turbulence properties , measured by spacecraft ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and coupled with theoretical and modelling work , suggest that parallel diffusion dominates over cross - field diffusion , with the diffusion coefficient ratio @xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , fits of sep intensity profiles performed with injection scenario and diffusion coefficients as free parameters suggest a considerably larger value , @xmath1 @xcite . on the other hand , the sharp dropouts observed in some sep events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been considered as evidence of only negligible cross - field diffusion of seps @xcite .",
    "the problem of accounting for the observed fast cross - field propagation for seps was recently addressed by @xcite . using full - orbit particle simulations",
    ", they found that the initial cross - field propagation with respect to the mean field direction is not diffusive , and can be described as field - aligned propagation of particles along stochastically meandering field lines .",
    "they concluded that for a uniform background magnetic field with turbulence parameters corresponding to solar wind conditions near earth , 10  mev protons propagated to distances of 1 au from the source remaining bound to their meandering field lines over time - scales of 6 hours .",
    "however , relative to the mean magnetic field direction , the meandering field lines spread the particles to a much wider cross - field extent than the asymptotic diffusion assumption . at later stage",
    ", the particles could be considered diffusive with respect to mean field direction only after 20 hours from their injection .",
    "the @xcite study thus indicated that for seps early in the event , the use of the diffusion description for particle cross - field propagation is invalid , and that only at longer time scales can its use be justified .",
    "the question then arises : when and how does the transition from non - diffusive to diffusive cross - field propagation take place , and how is the transition related to properties of the plasma turbulence ? how do the particles decouple from the field lines ?    the particle decoupling from field lines",
    "has been discussed previously in attempts to understand and develop a theory for the the time - asymptotic cross - field diffusion of particles in turbulent magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , quantifying the process of the particles leaving their field lines presents several challenges .",
    "the field line meandering is typically much faster than the decoupling of a particle from a field line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , a particle s displacement in the cross - field direction is a measure of the random walk of the magnetic field line , rather than the particle s random walk relative to the meandering field line . on the other hand ,",
    "determination of the particle s position relative to its original field line suffers from the uncertainty due to the variation of the magnetic field within the particle s path of gyration .    in this work",
    ", we introduce a new technique to determine the cross - field displacement of a particle from the meandering magnetic field line it initially follows .",
    "we use the new technique , presented in section  [ sec : models ] , to quantify the process of particle decoupling from its initial field line and evaluate contribution of the decoupling of the particle to the propagation of the particles across the mean magnetic field . in section",

    "the median displacement for logarithmically spaced time ranges is shown by the white - filled circles , and the lower and upper quartiles by the error bars .",
    "the larmor radius of a 10  mev proton in the given magnetic field is @xmath46 , thus for the particles for which @xmath47 , the guiding centre of the returning particle remains within a gyroradius of the initial location of the guiding centre .",
    "we can identify three time ranges of different behaviour of @xmath36 as a function of flight time .",
    "the first range , up to @xmath48 , contains particles that return to the initial plane close to the original location , and have roughly a linear trend of @xmath36 as a function of time , consistent with diffusive , or slightly superdiffusive , increase of the displacement . at around @xmath49 ,",

    "to do this , we fit @xmath36 as a function of time with a function that depicts initially a non - diffusive behaviour , @xmath51 , followed by a fast spreading across the field with @xmath52 , and a time - asymptotic diffusion , @xmath53 .",
    "overall , the function has the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents the square of displacement at @xmath56 , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the start and end times of the transition range , respectively . at early times , @xmath59 ,",
    "the equation describes the first diffusion range , with @xmath60 whereas at late times , @xmath61 , the second diffusion range is given as @xmath62 where @xmath63 it should be noted that the form of the fit function has no physical justification as such .",

    "the displacement rate during the first diffusion phase , @xmath55(blue dashed curve ) is a small fraction of @xmath66 , thus indicating that the decoupling of the particle from its field line is a slow process compared to the particle gyration .",
    "the displacement @xmath55 depends strongly on the turbulence amplitude , roughly as @xmath71 .",
    "the displacement rate during the second diffusion , @xmath69 , multiplied by @xmath72 in figure  [ fig : t_db2params ]  ( b ) ( solid green curve ) , is 3 - 4 orders of magnitudes larger than @xmath55 , and of order @xmath66 , which indicates that at time - scales @xmath73 the particles are fully separated from their initial field lines .",
    "the displacement @xmath69 is roughly proportional to @xmath74 , similar to the dependence of field line diffusion coefficient on the turbulence amplitude in 2d turbulence @xcite .",
    "the decrease of @xmath69 from the @xmath74 trend at large @xmath68 can be caused by more efficient parallel scattering , as can be seen in , e.g. , the nonlinear guiding centre theory @xcite .",

    "* ) , calculated assuming that only the slab turbulence contributes to the parallel scattering of the particles .",
    "for the kolmogorov turbulence spectral shape used in this study , the parallel scattering time depends on the turbulence amplitude and particle s larmor radius as @xmath81 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : t_db2params ]  ( c ) , @xmath82 values are close to the onset times of the transition phase , @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that the decoupling process of particles from their field lines may be related to pitch angle scattering of the particles .    in figure",
    "[ fig : t_db2params ]  ( d ) , we show the power law indices of the first diffusion and the transition ranges @xmath83 and @xmath84 , with the dashed blue and solid green , respectively .",
    "the first diffusion range is super - diffusive , with @xmath85 , showing approach to the diffusive limit @xmath86 for higher turbulence amplitudes .",
    "the transition phase ( green curve ) exhibits a very fast , super - diffusive cross - field expansion of the particle population from the initial magnetic field lines .",
    "the figure  [ fig : t_eparams ] shows the median displacement versus time for proton energies @xmath87 , 1  and 10  mev , with @xmath40 , in the same format as figure  [ fig : t_db2params ] . in panel",
    "( b ) the rate of the displacement during the first diffusion ( dashed blue curve ) depends only weakly on the particle energy , with @xmath88 .",
    "likewise , panel ( d ) shows that the first diffusion range power law index is nearly independent of the particle energy .",
    "the second phase displacement rate , @xmath69 , ( solid green curve in figure  [ fig : t_eparams ]  ( b ) ) decreases as @xmath89 , or @xmath90 . at time - asymptotic limit ( equation  ( [ eq : dx1 ] ) )",
    ", the displacement thus behaves as @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the distance a particle with velocity @xmath93 propagates in time @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the displacement of the particles during the second diffusion phase is a function of propagated distance , @xmath92 , only .",
    "this indicates that the particle cross - field propagation during the second diffusion phase is dominated by the structure of the turbulent magnetic fields rather than the properties of the particles .",
    "the panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig : t_eparams ] shows the onset times @xmath57 and @xmath58 as a function of the particle energy , along with @xmath82 . the onset times scale with energy as @xmath94 , with @xmath76 . as can be seen",
    ", the first onset time @xmath57 is again very similar ot the parallel scattering time , @xmath82 .",
    "our results show that the propagation of charged particles across the turbulently meandering field lines can be divided into three phases : the first diffusion , transition and second diffusion phases . during the first diffusion phase , the particle displacement from the meandering field line grows superdiffusively , with the displacement rate increasing as a function of the turbulence amplitude and particle energy . as seen in figures  [ fig : t_db2params ]  ( a ) and  [ fig : t_eparams ]  ( a ) , however , during the first diffusion the displacement of the particles does not exceed the particle s larmor radius scale , @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the particle can be considered as following a single field line during the first diffusion phase .",
    "it is important to note that this does not imply inhibited particle propagation across the mean magnetic field during the first diffusion phase .",
    "rather , the propagation of a particle across the mean magnetic field is determined by its propagation along a single meandering field line .",
    "the random walk of the field line can cause rapid , non - diffusive propagation of particles across the mean field direction @xcite .",
    "thus , the particle propagation during the first diffusion phase follows a scenario depicted in the left panel of figure  [ fig : diffusionschema ] .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that such a fast cross - field transport of particles offers and explanation to fast and wide sep events with realistic interplanetary conditions already with narrow source regions .",
    "the first diffusion phase continues until the transition phase onset , @xmath57 , which is of the order of tens to hundreds of gyroperiods for the particle and turbulence parameters used in this study . for a 10  mev proton in @xmath96 turbulence",
    ", this corresponds to 0.75 hours , a time in which a particle beam would propagate a distance of 0.7  au .",
    "this implies that the first diffusion range is very significant for the early propagation of seps in the heliosphere .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath57 is much larger than the cross - field velocity correlation time obtained from particle simulations by @xcite .",
    "however , their method yields the decorrelation time of a particle from an unperturbed orbit in a uniform magnetic field , whereas our method yields the decoupling time - scale of the particle from a meandering field line .    as shown in figures  [ fig : t_db2params ]  ( c ) and  [ fig : t_eparams ]  ( c ) , the onset of the transition phase , @xmath57 , is close to the parallel scattering timescale of the particles , @xmath82 , for the analysed 2d - dominated turbulence cases . this could be interpreted as evidence for a strong link between the parallel scattering of the particles and the particle decoupling from the meandering field lines .",
    "however , the interpretation can not be made quite so straightforwardly . in our simulations ,",
    "the particles , all initiated with @xmath43 , have all necessarily experienced pitch angle scattering to have @xmath97 , required for them to return back to the plane @xmath3 .",
    "thus , during the first diffusion , all of the simulated particles have experienced pitch angle scattering from the positive to the negative pitch angle cosine hemisphere even if their propagation time is much smaller than @xmath82 . therefore , while figures  [ fig : t_db2params ]  ( c ) and  [ fig : t_eparams ]  ( c ) indicate that the onset time of the transition phase , @xmath57 , is close to the parallel scattering time , @xmath82 , the connection between the parallel scattering and the particle decoupling from their field lines is likely more complicated than an effect due to backscattering of the particles .",
    "the transition phase is rapid and strongly superdiffusive , and continues until the onset of the second diffusion phase , @xmath58 . as shown in figures  [ fig :",
    "t_db2params ]  ( c ) and  [ fig : t_eparams ]  ( c ) , the onset time of the second diffusion scales as @xmath98 , independent of particle energy and turbulence amplitude .",
    "if we consider the time @xmath57 as the time - scale of the decoupling of the particle from its field line , the constant ratio @xmath99 can be interpreted as the number of decouplings taking place until the asymptotic diffusive behaviour in the second diffusion range is reached . in this interpretation , @xmath57 can be considered as the characteristic time - scale , the `` scattering time '' , for the particle diffusion across the mean magnetic field line .",
    "the scenario of subsequent decoupling of a particle from field lines leading to particle transport across the mean field is depicted in the right panel of figure  [ fig : diffusionschema ] .",
    "the transition to the second diffusion phase can be related to the recovery of diffusion reported by @xcite , who studied the cross - field displacement of particles at all @xmath7 instead of the particles that have returned to @xmath3 ( our method ) .",
    "they noted in their simulations that after an initial fast cross - field spreading , the running diffusion coefficient decreased , indicating subdiffusion , after which it reached a second diffusion phase .",
    "the fast spreading seen in the @xcite analysis can be understood as particles spreading in space along the meandering field lines as depicted in the left panel in our figure  [ fig : diffusionschema ] , and the subdiffusion due to particles backscattering along the meandering field lines ( compound diffusion : see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in our simulations , this behaviour is depicted by particles remaining in the first diffusion phase , which we have quantified in this study .",
    "the second diffusion in @xcite is likely caused by particles decoupling from their field line ( right panel in figure  [ fig : diffusionschema ] ) , which releases the particles from the the original fieldlines to trace the diffusive pattern of the turbulently meandering field lines .    as discussed in section  [ sec : results ] , the dependence of the second phase displacement rate , @xmath69 , on both the turbulence amplitude and energy is consistent with the particles diffusing across the mean field direction in a similar manner as the magnetic field lines diffuse .",
    "thus , our results are consistent with the recent works that derive the time - asymptotic cross - field diffusion coefficients using the statistics of the field line diffusion in the derivation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the second diffusion is reached only at @xmath58 , which is of order hundreds to thousands of gyroperiods . for a 10  mev proton in a @xmath96 turbulence",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath1007.5  hours .",
    "thus , our results suggest that the use of particle transport models where the cross - field diffusion coefficients are derived at time - asymptotic limit can not be justified when modelling the early propagation of seps in the interplanetary space .",
    "it should be noted that the particles being decoupled from their field lines does not imply that a solution of a diffusive particle transport equation can be used to describe the particle distribution everywhere in space .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the particles at 1  au from the injection site spread to a wide cross - field range early in the event due to field line meandering .",
    "while the particles decouple from the field lines at time - scale @xmath58 , the cross - field extent of the particles at 1  au is still dominated by the initial spread of the particles along meandering field lines . as shown in figure  3 of @xcite , the 10  mev proton spreading due to decoupling results in time - asymptotic diffusion behaviour at 1  au only @xmath101 20   hours after their injection in turbulence with @xmath96 turbulence .",
    "to understand when the particle propagation can be considered as time - asymptotic , we must understand how the decoupling of the particles takes place , and how it contributes to the transition to the time - asymptotic propagation phase .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the decoupling of particles from the field lines by deriving a diffusion coefficient for cross - field propagation of particles due to curvature and gradient drifts caused by the turbulent magnetic fields .",
    "their first - order analysis found no contribution from the 2d turbulence to decoupling of particles from the field - lines , whereas slab turbulence resulted in subdiffusive decoupling .",
    "thus , their result is not consistent with our findings , where in the slab+2d turbulence the returning particles spread from their field - lines superdiffusively , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : t_db2params ] and  [ fig : t_eparams ] .",
    "the decoupling of particles from their field lines may also be related to how the field lines decouple from each other .",
    "@xcite found that neighbouring field lines initially follow each other almost coherently , with slow diffusive divergence that turns into a fast spreading at length scale @xmath102 , given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the parallel correlation length of the turbulence , @xmath105 in the simulations presented in figures  [ fig : t_db2params ] and  [ fig : t_eparams ] , however , @xmath106 , thus the neighbouring field lines would decorrelate already at a fraction of parallel correlation length , thus much shorter than @xmath107 given by our simulations .    to further study",
    "whether the @xcite and @xcite formulations can be applied to our results , we ran additional simulations with slab - dominated turbulence .",
    "it should be noted that cross - field propagation of charged particles is strongly inhibited in pure slab turbulence @xcite .",
    "in addition , the field - line separation scale , @xmath102 , as defined by equation  ( [ eq : separationcoherence ] ) , would be infinite in pure slab turbulence , indicating absence of strong field - line separation .",
    "thus , as we are interested in understanding non - negligible cross - field propagation of particles in turbulent magnetic fields , we use slab - dominated turbulence with a small 2d component instead of pure slab turbulence .",
    "such a slab - dominated turbulence mix allows for finite @xmath102 , and particle propagation is not as constrained as in pure slab turbulence .    in figure",
    "[ fig : slabish ] , we show results of simulations of 10  mev protons in turbulence with @xmath108 for 20% ( green squares ) and 99% ( blue circles ) slab contributions , with the error bars representing the lower and upper deciles , respectively .",
    "we present the displacement @xmath36 as a function of a length scale instead of time , to gain understanding of the transition process in terms of  @xmath102 . as length scale , we consider the maximum distance the particle has propagated along the mean field direction , @xmath109 , before returning to the plane it was injected at . in our analysis , we have used mean instead of median square displacement , to obtain better correspondence with the displacement values predicted by the @xcite theory . it should be noted , though , that as we simulate the particles only until their first time of return to the @xmath3 plane , full correspondence with the absolute values can not be expected .",
    "in addition to the mean displacement of the returning particles , we show in figure  [ fig : slabish ] the field line divergence scale @xmath102 ( equation  ( [ eq : separationcoherence ] ) ) with the vertical solid blue line and dashed green line for the slab- and 2d - dominated cases respectively , and the particle larmor radius scale with the vertical black line .",
    "the @xmath110 due to stochastic drifts for slab turbulence , as given by @xcite , is shown with the solid magenta curve .",
    "it should be noted that our simulations are not sufficiently long for analysing the second diffusion range by fitting the equation  ( [ eq : powerfit ] ) in the slab - dominated case , due to computational limitations .",
    "thus , we will concentrate below on analysis of the first diffusion range and the onset of the transition phase , and discuss the transition phase only qualitatively .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : slabish ] , the first diffusion range and the subsequent transition phase can be observed for both the slab - dominated and 2d - dominated turbulence . for the slab - dominated turbulence , the sub - diffusive trend of the @xcite result ( blue circles )",
    "is well replicated by our simulations .",
    "thus , in the parameter range relevant to the @xcite work , at scales @xmath111 where the field - line separation due to the 1% 2d - component is negligible , we find agreement with the previous theoretical work and our results .",
    "the super - diffusive displacement increase in the 2d - dominated turbulence ( green squares in figure  [ fig : slabish ] ) seen in our simulations , however , deviates strongly from the @xcite result .",
    "we suggest two possible explanations for this .",
    "one is related to the field - line divergence scale @xmath102 . as shown by the dashed green vertical line in fig .",
    "[ fig : slabish ] , @xmath112 for the 2d - dominated case , well below the start of the transition from the first diffusion range , at @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the field line de - coherence at short length scales may influence the particle spreading already during the first diffusion range , possibly turning the subdiffusive spreading predicted by @xcite ( solid magenta curve ) into the super - diffusive behaviour shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slabish ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "as speculated by @xcite , the particle decoupling may be affected by second - order effects by the 2d turbulence component , which their theory does not account for .",
    "@xcite present their result also for isotropic turbulence , shown with a dashed magenta line in fig .",
    "[ fig : slabish ] .",
    "as can be seen , it matches the simulation trend and level of the 2d - dominated case considerably better than their slab result .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : slabish ] , the transition from the first diffusion to the transition range in the slab - dominated case ( blue circles ) takes place for particles that have reached the distance @xmath114 .",
    "thus , in the slab - dominated turbulence , the strong separation of the field lines at scales @xmath102 @xcite appears to be connected to the particle decoupling from their field lines .",
    "similar conclusion can not be drawn in the 2d - dominated case ( the green squares in figure  [ fig : slabish ] ) : as suggested by the dashed green vertical line , the field lines are strongly separated much before the onset of the transition phase , at around @xmath115 .",
    "figures  [ fig : t_db2params ]  ( a ) and  [ fig : t_eparams ]  ( a ) suggest a different explanation for the transition of the particle displacements from the first diffusion range in the 2d - dominated turbulence . the displacement can be seen to reach the magnitude of the particle larmor radius , @xmath95 , at the transition onset time , @xmath57 in all of our simulations with 2d - dominated turbulence .",
    "we quantify this in figure [ fig : dx2_at_t1 ] , where we compare the displacement of the particle at the transition onset time , i.e. , @xmath116 , ( solid green curve ) , for different simulations , with the particle larmor radius @xmath95 ( dashed blue curve ) .",
    "as can be seen , at the onset of the transition range , the particles have moved away by an order of larmor radius from their original gyrocenter .",
    "it should be noted that in the slab - dominated case ( figure  [ fig : slabish ] ) , the mean displacement is considerably smaller than the larmor radius at the time of the transition , at around @xmath117 .",
    "thus , the decoupling of the particles from their field lines , as defined by the change from the first diffusion phase to the superdiffusive transition phase at @xmath57 , may be fundamentally different in slab- and 2d - dominated turbulence .",
    "the role of the particle s larmor radius as a determining factor for particle cross - field propagation has been discussed in the context of electron heat transport in tokamak plasmas by @xcite , who considered the electrons to be displaced from their field lines by coulomb collisions .",
    "@xcite used a similar idea to model the time - asymptotic diffusion of particles in turbulent plasmas as ballistic propagation of particles along meandering field lines , punctuated by decouplings on the time - scale of the parallel scattering time of the particles .",
    "this concept is supported by the close similarity of the transition phase onset time @xmath57 and the parallel scattering timescale @xmath82 seen in the 2d - dominated turbulence cases of our study .",
    "however , as discussed above , the particles analysed in this study have all backscattered in field - parallel direction to return to the initial @xmath3 plane .",
    "thus , during the first diffusion , the parallel scattering does not efficiently decouple particles from their initial field lines .",
    "in addition , the similarity of @xmath57 and @xmath82 is valid only for the 2d - dominated cases analysed in this study . for the slab - dominated scenario we determined @xmath118 , considerably larger than the parallel diffusion time , @xmath119 for @xmath108 and the proton energy of 10  mev .",
    "therefore , our results indicate that scattering alone does not imply a significant displacement of particles from their field lines .",
    "pitch angle scattering may , however , be significant for cross - field propagation of particles in turbulent magnetic fields . as discussed in section  [ sec : results ] , the transition onset time @xmath57 depends on the turbulence amplitude and energy in a similar way as the pitch angle diffusion time - scale @xmath120 , suggesting that faster pitch angle isotropisation leads to faster transition onset @xmath57 .",
    "this may connected to the proportionality of the cross - field diffusion due to stochastic drifts on @xmath121 @xcite , where @xmath122 is the pitch angle cosine .",
    "this dependence indicates that an isotropic distribution would decouple from the meandering field lines faster from the meandering fields than an anisotropic one .",
    "it should be noted that in the view of the schematic picture presented in the right panel of figure  [ fig : diffusionschema ] , the dependence of the cross - field particle diffusion on @xmath122 is not obvious .",
    "strong cross - field propagation due to field line meandering requires efficient decoupling of particles from their field lines , and in the light of the @xcite result , pitch angles @xmath123 . on the other hand",
    ", the spreading of particles across the mean magnetic field direction due to propagation along meandering field lines requires large particle velocities along the field lines , i.e. @xmath124 .",
    "thus , pitch angle dependence of the cross - field particle diffusion particle transport may be more complicated than the recently discussed proportionality to @xmath125 or @xmath126 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and discussion therein ) .",
    "overall , our simulations show the importance of understanding the microphysics of the particle decoupling from their original field lines for understanding the propagation of particles across the mean magnetic field in turbulent plasmas .",
    "in this work , we have studied how charged particles spread across the mean field direction in turbulent magnetic fields superimposed on a uniform field , by analysing the displacement of a particle from its initial , meandering , field line instead of the mean field .",
    "our results show that    * the particles initially follow their initial meandering field lines , over time scales @xmath127 , or @xmath128  minutes , for a 10  mev protons in turbulent magnetic fields corresponding to the solar wind at 1  au from the sun , with @xmath129 @xcite . *",
    "the time - asymptotic diffusion , consistent with cross - field diffusion dominated by random walk of field lines is reached in time - scales @xmath130 , or hours to a day for a 10  mev proton . *",
    "the transition from the first to the second diffusion range may depend on stochastic gradient and curvature drifts , field line decoherence and pitch angle scattering of the particles , depending on the turbulence parameters .",
    "our results suggest that the first diffusion range , where the particles stay on their field lines , is significant for sep event evolution : 10  mev protons simulated propagate a distance of 1  au in @xmath131  minutes , which is of the order of the time - scale a particle remains completely bound to its field , @xmath57 , in turbulence conditions corresponding to those of the solar wind at 1  au .",
    "further , full relaxation to the time - asymptotic diffusive particle propagation would be reached in a time - scale of hours to a day .",
    "it should be noted that the turbulence parameters vary radially ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also as a function of time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the temporal variation will cause also longitudinal variation of the turbulence parameters , due to the solar rotation .",
    "also the large - scale magnetic field structure , and the associated large - scale particle drifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may influence the particle decoupling from their field lines .",
    "thus , a full study including utilising solar wind and turbulence observations and models is required to understand the sep propagation in the interplanetary space in different solar wind turbulence conditions .",
    "our results indicate that the field line meandering controls the particle propagation both in the early phases and at time - asymptotic phases of particle cross - field spreading . however , as depicted in the schematic view in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffusionschema ] , the effect of the field line meandering manifests itself completely differently at these phases .",
    "the early cross - field propagation is characterised by particles following their initial field lines , and is thus deterministic propagation along stochastic paths . the time - asymptotic propagation , on the other hand , is characterised by particles decoupling from their original field lines at time - scales @xmath58 , which causes the particles to random - walk from one random - walking field line to another .",
    "the mechanism of the early time particle cross - field propagation presented in our study provides also a possible explanation for the sep intensity dropouts .",
    "these dropouts , observed in some sep events ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , imply strong cross - field gradients in spatial sep distribution in these events .",
    "while such gradients would be smoothed by the time - asymptotic cross - field diffusion @xcite , our simulations show that the cross - field propagation of the particles across the meandering field lines is negligible during the first diffusion phase , enabling the intensity dropouts to persist .",
    "the mechanism behind the transition phase between the first and second diffusion ranges remains unclear , and requires further study .",
    "our results show that the first diffusion phase and the transition phase of the particle cross - field transport exists both for 2d and slab - dominated turbulence , which suggests that the transition is a general feature in early cross - field propagation of particles in turbulent magnetic fields .",
    "we have identified potential mechanisms through comparison with the stochastic drift diffusion theory @xcite , the field line decoherence @xcite , parallel scattering timescale of the particles , and the distance the particle deviates from its field line before the transition commences .",
    "however , the relative contribution of different processes appears to depend on the composition of the turbulence . in a future work",
    ", we will study the interplay between different phenomena contributing to particle cross - field propagation by using guiding centre simulations that include the relevant physics and comparing them to full - orbit simulations as well as theoretical results .",
    "such a study would be capable of improving our understanding on not only the transition stage of the charged particle cross - field propagation , but also how the time - asymptotic diffusive behaviour is formed ."
