    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have two phases . a short prompt phase in which the emission is predominantly in the sub - mev range is followed by a multi - wavelength afterglow that can be observed up to several years after the prompt emission . according to the generally accepted internal - external model @xcite the prompt emission",
    "is thought to originate from internal energy dissipation that takes place within the relativistic outflow .",
    "conversely , the afterglow radiation is thought to originate from interactions between the outflow and the external medium @xcite .",
    "while the origin of the afterglow radiation has been understood in its general properties of synchrotron emission @xcite , the nature of the prompt radiation has not yet been completely unveiled .",
    "indeed , the nature of both the dissipation and the radiative mechanisms is still uncertain . the composition of the outflow , its initial energy content , and the processes at the origin of the prompt radiation are among the most relevant open issues in grb studies .",
    "a critical issue in this model is the ratio of energy involved in the first ( prompt ) and second ( afterglow ) phases .",
    "this ratio reflects the efficiency of the prompt radiation process , a very important clue on the nature of this mechanism .",
    "the kinetic energy left in the blast wave after the prompt phase can be estimated from afterglow observations . assuming that the cooling frequency lies below the x - ray band , the x - ray luminosity provides a robust estimate of the energy stored in the accelerated electrons , which in turn is directly related to the kinetic energy of the outflow @xcite . under this assumption ,",
    "several studies have exploited both pre - swift x - ray observations @xcite , and swift x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have inferred a relatively low kinetic energy , which implies quite a large prompt efficiency : @xmath9 .",
    "the discovery of the x - ray plateaus in many of the swift grbs increased the severity of the efficiency problem .",
    "the x - ray flux at the beginning of the plateau phase ( around 500 sec ) is lower by a factor @xmath10 as compared with the flux estimated by extrapolating backwards in time the observations at @xmath11day and therefore leads to an estimate of the kinetic energy lower by the same factor and to efficiencies of up to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "internal shocks are the dominant internal dissipation process for matter dominated flows @xcite . since their efficiency is rather low @xcite it was expected that after the prompt phase most of the energy would remain as bulk kinetic energy of the blast wave .",
    "alternative scenarios , such as magnetic reconnection @xcite ( that require a magnetically dominated rather than a matter dominated outflow ) may reach higher efficiencies , leaving less energy in the blast wave .",
    "thus the high efficiency , implied by the x - ray afterglow observations , is generally considered as a major problem for the internal shocks model and suggested that other mechanisms , such as magnetic reconnection take place .",
    "however , two implicit assumptions have been made when deriving these estimates : first it was assumed that the electrons emitting at x - rays are fast cooling ( i.e. the x - ray is above all the typical synchrotron break frequencies ) and second the x - ray flux of these electrons is not suppressed by synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) losses @xcite .",
    "if either one of these assumptions is not satisfied the energy estimates based on the x - ray fluxes might be wrong .",
    "observations at higher energies could be helpful in constraining the location of the synchrotron cooling frequency and assess the importance of the ssc mechanism .",
    "grbs can now be studied at energies between @xmath13gev and @xmath14gev thanks to the large area telescope ( lat ) on board fermi .",
    "while only a small fraction of fermi detected grbs have also been detected by lat , some of these cases ( about 10 events ) are particularly interesting , since they show characteristics suggestive of an external shock origin for the gev radiation : first , the onset of these emission is delayed relative to the onset of the prompt sub - mev emission @xcite ; second the lat component extends long after the prompt sub - mev emission stops and third the flux of this long lasting component decays as a power - law in time .",
    "indeed , these observations are compatible with expectations from forward shock radiation @xcite .",
    "we can exploit the afterglow observations at high energies to address the questions of the determination of the synchrotron cooling frequency and the importance of the ssc mechanism ( which leads to a determination of the energy content of the fireball and the efficiency of the prompt mechanism ) .",
    "we examine a sample of grbs detected _ both _ by lat and xrt , and use both the gev and the x - ray fluxes to estimate the blast wave kinetic energy .",
    "we show that the two estimates are inconsistent with each other .",
    "the energy inferred from the gev emission is much larger than that estimated from the x - rays .",
    "this can be explained if either i ) the x - ray emitting electrons , unlike those emitting at gev energies , are in the slow cooling regime , or ii ) if electrons radiating at x - rays are significantly cooled by ssc , while those radiating at gev energies are in the klein - nishina ( kn ) regime and cool only by synchrotron . in both scenarios the x - ray flux is no longer a proxy for the blast wave kinetic energy .",
    "we examine afterglow models for the gev , x - ray and ( when available ) optical data in order to determine if one or both of the mentioned scenario represents a viable solution to the xrt / lat apparent inconsistency .",
    "the nature of the solution depends on the cooling frequency and on the value of the compton parameter .",
    "both depend strongly on the fraction of energy stored in the downstream magnetic field @xmath15 and on the density of the external medium @xmath16 .",
    "modelling of the data allows us , therefore , to constrain these parameters .",
    "recent works on grbs with gev emission @xcite and without it ( @xcite ; @xcite ) suggested a distribution for the @xmath15 parameter that extends down to very small values : @xmath17 . in this work",
    "we derive upper limits on @xmath15 as a function of the external medium density and find similar results : upper limits on @xmath15 derived form our sample range from @xmath18 down to @xmath19 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sample ]",
    "we describe the sample of grbs used in this paper . in  [ efficiency ]",
    "we show that the kinetic energies of the blast waves inferred from gev data are much higher than those inferred from the x - ray observations , and in turn the corresponding prompt efficiencies are much smaller .",
    "we examine , in  [ sec : model ] , both scenarios and we provide analytic estimates of the parameters needed to explain the observations .",
    "we present the numerical method used to model the data and describe the results of the detailed numerical modeling in  [ sect : results ] .",
    "finally , in  [ conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we consider a sample of grbs detected both by fermi - lat and by swift - xrt .",
    "we included in our sample only those bursts for which the lat emission lasted much longer than the prompt phase , since we are interested in cases in which the lat is most likely afterglow radiation from the external forward shock .",
    "when available we use optical observations to further constrain the solution .",
    "the final sample includes ten grbs , listed in table [ tbl : data ] .",
    "the redshift has been firmly measured for nine of those .    to ensure that the measured fluxes are most likely originated at the forward shock with no reverse shock contribution and to make a proper comparison with previous studies , we chose xrt observations that are as close as possible to @xmath11day .",
    "we select two observation times for each burst . the first such that it satisfies the following conditions : i ) they are as close as possible to one day , ii ) subsequent to the end of any plateau phase in the light - curve that might be present ( this phase is present only for one burst in the sample , grb 090510 ) and iii ) before the jet break time ( when present ) . the second observation time is chosen such that it is as far removed from the first observation as possible ( in order to enable a good estimate of the light - curve power law index ) while satisfying conditions ii ) and iii ) .",
    "such late observations are not available for the lat and we therefore use earlier epochs for the lat measurements . for lat",
    "we use two data points as far removed in time as possible given that they are after @xmath20 ( the duration of the prompt emission as determined by the lower energy fermi / gbm detector ) and provided that the flux measurement is still well constrained .    for the lat fluxes we used values reported in the first fermi / lat grb catalog @xcite for nine of the bursts , while for grb 130427a we used the results reported in @xcite .",
    "the x - ray fluxes are taken from the swift / xrt grb light curve repository @xcite and the optical fluxes are collected from the literature . the complete list of lat , x - ray and optical fluxes and observations times",
    "is reported in table [ tbl : data ] .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     we begin by considering simplified analytic estimates to explore if and how the two proposed scenarios can explain the apparent kinetic energy inconsistency .",
    "the analytic estimates allow us to understand what are the conditions that the free parameters ( and in particular @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) must satisfy in order to reconcile the kinetic energy estimates from both x - ray and the gev observations .    in order to present analytic estimates",
    "we make the simplified assumption that the gev radiation is always above @xmath21 and that due to kn suppression , compton cooling does not affect the spectrum at these frequencies @xcite , i.e. @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the kn frequency , above which seed photons undergo kn suppressed ic scatterings , and is given by @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is planck s constant , @xmath26 is the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath27 is the cosmological redshift and @xmath28 is the typical lorentz factor of electrons in the co - moving frame which is always equal to or larger than the minimum lorentz factor - either @xmath29 for slow cooling or @xmath30 for fast cooling ) . if @xmath31 , the upper limit to the kn frequency is constant in time and depends only on @xmath32 . for @xmath33 ,",
    "its value is around @xmath34hz , well below the lat band . at early times",
    "@xmath29 might be larger than @xmath30 , and @xmath23 is larger that what estimated in the previous case , but still below the lat range .",
    "therefore , in first approximation , the gev flux is a proxy of the kinetic energy .",
    "@xmath35 can be derived from eq .",
    "[ eq : abovec ] ( see below ) , using @xmath36 @xmath37 is the compton parameter for gev emitting electrons ) .",
    "this assumption greatly simplifies the analytical expressions .",
    "the validity of this assumption is revisited in  [",
    "sect : results ] , where we numerically estimate @xmath38 , instead of assuming @xmath39 .",
    "we find that in any case its value is of order unity or smaller , and the approximation @xmath39 that we use in this section is good enough to derive order of magnitude estimates .",
    "we fix the fraction of shocked energy in electrons to @xmath33 .",
    "we do this for four reasons .",
    "first , contrary to @xmath15 , the values of @xmath32 from afterglow modeling do not vary over orders of magnitude and are often consistent with 0.1 @xcite .",
    "second , this value is consistent with numerical simulations of shock acceleration @xcite .",
    "third , @xcite have shown ( for a sample of 10 bursts that almost completely overlaps with the one used here ) that @xmath32 must be narrowly distributed and that gev light curves are consistent with a value 0.1 .",
    "fourth , since the radiated energy is limited to the energy in the electrons ( @xmath40 ) , the inferred energy from the observed flux is larger for smaller values of @xmath32 . therefore it can not be much lower than 0.1 in order to avoid un - physically large energy requirements .",
    "these considerations significantly limit the allowed range of this parameter and allow us to fix it without much loss of generality .",
    "we are left with three free parameters : @xmath15 , @xmath41 , and @xmath16 ( or @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the wind parameter defined by @xmath44 for a wind environment ) .",
    "we may therefore use the expression for the x - ray flux to obtain @xmath15 as a function of @xmath16 ( or @xmath45 ) , and @xmath41 .",
    "ssc suppressed case [ s : ssc ] if compton losses are important , the flux above the cooling frequency scales as @xmath46 .",
    "therefore @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the compton parameter for the x - ray emitting electrons ) .",
    "the difference in energies can be explained as a difference in the respective compton @xmath49 parameters . in the ssc",
    "suppressed case , the expression for the x - ray flux , @xmath50 , is that of synchrotron above the cooling frequency @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the luminosity distance , @xmath54 is the time since explosion in days , both @xmath55 and @xmath56 are in the observer frame and we use the notation : @xmath57 in c.g.s .",
    "units here and elsewhere in the text ( the numerical coefficients of the ism and wind cases in eq .",
    "[ eq : abovec ] are not very different ) .",
    "we assume that x - ray emitting electrons are in the thomson regime , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in this regime ,",
    "the compton parameter @xmath48 is given by ( see appendix [ comptony ] for a derivation ) : @xmath60 note that this is an implicit equation , as @xmath21 also depends on @xmath48 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : nuc ] below ) .",
    "the typical frequencies , @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 is the synchrotron frequency of the typical electron energy ) are given by : @xmath63 and @xmath64 since @xmath21 depends on the external density , so does @xmath48 , and also @xmath50 .",
    "equating an observed x - ray flux to the flux given by eq .",
    "[ eq : abovec ] we obtain @xmath65 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the times of the gev and the x - ray observations in days , and @xmath68 are dimensionless functions such that @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "all the pre - factors are chosen such that they are expected to be close to 1 , and therefore the leading numerical values are an order of magnitude estimate for @xmath15 in this regime .",
    "it is evident that very low values of @xmath15 are required in order for the x - ray and the gev observations to be compatible with each other in the ssc suppressed type solution .",
    "this is expected , as very weak magnetic fields are essential in order to have a sufficiently strong ssc cooling .",
    "slow cooling case [ s : slowcooling ] we assume now that @xmath73 . in this case the x - ray flux is given by @xcite : @xmath74 comparing the observed x - ray flux at late times with the flux given by eq .",
    "[ eq : belowc ] we obtain @xmath65 or @xmath75 : @xmath76 where @xmath77 are dimensionless functions such that @xmath78 for @xmath70 and @xmath79 for @xmath72 .",
    "once again , @xmath15 should be very low to allow for this type of solution .",
    "the analytic estimates show that for reasonable external density parameters ( @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) , @xmath15 should be very low in both the ssc suppressed and the slow cooling scenarios . combining the estimates in  [ s : ssc ] ,  [ s : slowcooling ] we obtain : @xmath3 .",
    "this result is in agreement with recent findings @xcite .",
    "we turn now to a detailed numerical modeling of the afterglow , which might also help us to distinguish between the two solutions .",
    "we numerically model the afterglow emission and compare the expected fluxes with the gev , x - ray and optical observations listed in table [ tbl : data ] . in the numerical model",
    "we relax all the simplifying assumptions made above .",
    "in particular we relax the assumptions that @xmath21 is below the gev band at @xmath82 or that the gev and x - ray fluxes are dominated by synchrotron ( and not ssc ) .",
    "we calculate the synchrotron and ssc spectra following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , the method developed by @xcite allows us to compute the compton parameter @xmath83 as a function of the electron energy and to include possible corrections due to kn , that may affect the shape of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "we ignore the fact that at a given moment in time we observe emission from different emitting radii @xcite .",
    "we used @xcite , to verify that the magnitude of this effect can not change the flux as compared with the spectra we are using by more than @xmath84 . for each burst , we consider values of @xmath85 and @xmath41 in the range @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath18 @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath88 .",
    "we keep the fraction of shocked energy in the electrons to @xmath90 .",
    "we calculate the fluxes at @xmath91 , and @xmath92 ( the latter is the time of optical observations , in case such observations exist ) at the observed frequency ( @xmath93mev , @xmath1kev , @xmath94ev respectively ) .",
    "we consider a model as acceptable if the difference between the estimated fluxes and the data points is within the errors ( where the errors take into account both the uncertainties of the observations and of the model ) .",
    "we remark that for some bursts it is possible that more detailed observations ( i.e. in more frequency bands and at different times or using the spectral indices in the available observed bands ) will further constrain the allowed parameter space . where we do use spectral indices ) .",
    "this assures that we are recovering the correct slope of the light - curve . for the gev we consider two data points after @xmath20 , in order to avoid possible contamination from the prompt",
    "we are therefore considering the data point where the flux is smaller , and the errors on the spectral index and temporal decay can be very large",
    ". however , we know that lat spectra that are rising in @xmath95 are rarely observed and in any case their photon index is never harder than -1.7 . in order to consider only realistic solutions , we add this requirement on the lat spectral index .",

    "optical observations are available for eight out of ten bursts in our sample and we include them in the modeling .",
    "the optical data is missing for grb 100414a and grb 110625a .",
    "the x - ray band may either be above or below cooling ( corresponding to the  ssc suppressed \" and  slow cooling \" cases respectively ) . however , there are generally no reasonable solutions with the optical band being above the cooling frequency at times of order @xmath11day , with the possible exception of grb  090926a for which such a solution is only marginally consistent for low values of @xmath96 ( see also @xcite ) . for all considered grbs",
    "we can successfully reproduce the observed fluxes within the general synchrotron or synchrotron self compton model described above .",
    "this supports the interpretation of gev photons as radiation from the external forward shock , at least for those bursts considered in this study , which are all the bursts with a long lasting , power law decaying gev emission .",
    "we present , first , detailed results for one grb and then we discuss more generally the results obtained for all bursts in our sample . we choose to discuss the case of grb  080916c in an ism environment . for this burst",
    "both the  suppressed ssc \" and the  slow cooling \" solutions can account for the observations .",
    "in addition , there are some solutions at large densities ( @xmath97 ) and very weak magnetic fields ( @xmath98 ) in which both the gev and x - ray fluxes are dominated by ssc instead of synchrotron emission .",
    "however , a more careful examination reveals that all the ssc dominated solutions for this burst correspond to a gev photon index @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) which is not in agreement with observations ( for all the bursts in our sample , the photon index is known and it is never harder than -1.7 .",
    "in fact , this is true even when considering the entire sample of grbs detected by gev , as can be seen in fig .",

    "we show the lowest value of @xmath35 , regardless of the value of @xmath41 .",
    "the reported values of @xmath35 should then be considered as lower limits .",
    "the compton parameter @xmath48 can vary between 3 - 100 . at the lower end of this range , @xmath48",

    "[ yx ] ) used for the analytic estimates presented in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath38 can vary between 0.1 - 3 , implying that a moderate suppression of the gev flux might also take place , but only when @xmath15 is very small and @xmath16 is large . for @xmath101 and for x - rays in thomson regime ,",
    "the numerical results are indeed compatible with the analytical formulas presented in eqns .",
    "[ eq : ssc ] , [ eq : slow ] .",
    "the shape of the allowed parameter space can be understood in the following way .",
    "first , the border to the lower left of the  ssc suppressed \" region is defined by @xmath102 at the time of x - ray observations . below this line ,",
    "the x - ray flux is produced by slow cooling electrons ( this roughly corresponds to the upper right border of the  slow cooling \" solutions , where some superposition is allowed due to variations of the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "the upper border in both cases is due to the fact that for larger densities the gev component becomes dominated by ssc instead of synchrotron radiation .",
    "finally the upper right border for the  ssc suppressed \" solutions arises from the requirement that @xmath48 should be large enough as compared with @xmath38 in order to account for the flux discrepancy between the gev and the x - rays .",
    "all the allowed solutions correspond to isotropic equivalent kinetic energies satisfying @xmath103ergs , and imply that the prompt efficiency is moderate : @xmath104 .",
    "this limit on the efficiency rules out the value inferred just from the x - ray observations ( @xmath105 ) that is derived assuming that x - rays are above @xmath21 . the allowed parameter space results in strong upper limits on the magnetization : @xmath106 , regardless of the type of solution .",
    "strong limits on the magnetization ( @xmath107 ) can be obtained also for solutions in a wind medium , consistent with previous estimates of the magnetization for this burst @xcite .",
    "typical seds ( spectral energy distributions ) for the  ssc suppressed \" and  slow cooling \" cases for this burst ( for a particular set of parameters ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] .",
    "the solid curves are the seds resulting from numerical calculation at six different times : at the time of the two lat observations ( red ) , at the time of the two x - ray observations ( blue ) , and at the time of the two optical observations ( green ) .",

    "the red and blue dashed lines are the expected synchrotron spectrum above @xmath21 , at the time of lat and xrt observations , under the assumption that the flux is not suppressed by ic ( eq . [ eq : abovec ] ) .",
    "it is evident that , according to this modelling , this assumption is correct for the gev data , while it is not correct for x - ray observations , either because the x - ray observations lie below @xmath21 ( left panel ) or because at the x - ray frequency the flux is strongly suppressed by ic ( right panel ) .    a similar analysis has been performed for all bursts in our sample , for both constant and wind - like density profiles of the external medium . for a constant profile ( ism ) , four bursts have both  ssc suppressed \" and  slow cooling \" type solutions , while one has only a ",

    "these limits on the isotropic energy can be translated into limits on the collimation corrected energy if the jet opening angle is known ( or if a lower limit on the jet opening angle can be estimated from the non - detection of a steepening in the afterglow light curve - i.e. , a jet break ) .",

    "this is due to the many different parameters involved in determining these limits . for low enough densities ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) , the solutions are usually of the  slow cooling \" type . in this regime ,",
    "the upper limit on @xmath15 is determined by the condition @xmath117 . in some bursts ( but for ism only ) , for somewhat larger densities ( @xmath118 ) , there are  ssc suppressed \" type solutions , and in this case the limits on @xmath15 arise from the requirement that @xmath48 should be sufficiently large to account for the ratio of fluxes between gev and x - rays . for larger densities ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) there might be solutions where the gev flux becomes dominated by ssc , and , if such a solutions exist they are limited by the fact that as @xmath15 increases the ssc peak becomes too weak and the flux in the gev band is no longer sufficiently large as compared with that in x - rays . finally , for the largest densities ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) the flux may become dominated by ssc both in the gev band and in the x - rays .",
    "since the optical band in this case is still dominated by synchrotron , the allowed solutions are then limited by the fact that as @xmath15 increases the ssc peak becomes weaker and can not account simultaneously for the gev and optical fluxes .    in principle",
    ", another constraint on these solutions arises from the fact that there is no evidence for a passage of the cooling break through the x - ray band during the time of observation .",
    "this constraint is only relevant for bursts in a wind environment ( for which @xmath21 increases with time ) and  ssc suppressed \" solutions , and for bursts in an ism environment ( where @xmath21 decreases with time ) for the  slow cooling \" solutions .",
    "however , due to the fact that x - ray observations are typically available for less than 2 decades in time ( say 0.1 - 10 days ) , and since @xmath21 evolves only slowly with time ( @xmath123 for an ism environment and @xmath124 in a wind ) , @xmath21 can not change by more than an order of magnitude during the duration of the observation .",
    "this is less than the spectral range of xrt ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) , and since we are using integrated fluxes in this work , it will result in an undetectable spectral change given the quality of the data .                          for four bursts in our sample , early time x - ray observations ( simultaneous to observations in the gev band )",

    "so far we have considered only late time x - ray data , because our aim is to test if these data can be safely used to infer the blast wave kinetic energy . in this section",
    "we exploit early time simultaneous x - ray / gev detections ( when available ) in order to test the consistency of our modelling and possibly reduce the parameter space identified by the modeling of late time x - ray data .",
    "for all bursts we find that the parameter space overlaps with the one inferred from late time observations . in other words , it exists a region of the parameter space that allows a good description of both early and late time x - ray and gev fluxes . in the following we discuss in detail our findings , for each one of these bursts .      for this burst",

    "these ranges of values are similar to those obtained with the late time data , but somewhat wider .",

    "these results are similar to those obtained by @xcite , who show that the 100 s data is best modelled by a fast cooling synchrotron component for the x - rays and an ssc component for the gev .",
    "they also find that large isotropic energies , large densities and very low @xmath15 are required .",
    "other studies @xcite have shown that the observations can be explained in the context of a homogeneous medium if a very small density is invoked ( @xmath128 ) , well below the range of densities considered in this work .",
    "these studies also outline that some deviation from the standard forward shock scenario ( energy injection , evolution of the microphysical parameters in time or a structured jet model ) is required in order to obtain a good description of the observations .      for this burst we model the sed at 260 seconds .",
    "both the x - ray and gev data are taken from @xcite . once again , as for the late time data , there is no available parameter space if a homogeneous medium is assumed . for a wind medium ,",
    "however , two sets of parameter ranges are found , similar to what was found from the modelling of the late time data .",
    "the first one ( @xmath129 , @xmath130ergs , @xmath131 ) corresponds to a x - rays either dominated by fast cooling synchrotron or by ssc ( for the larger densities ) and gev emission always dominated by the ssc component .",
    "the second set of parameters is found at lower densities ( @xmath132 ) , larger isotropic energies ( @xmath133ergs ) and similar values of @xmath15 . in this case , the x - rays are dominated by slow cooling synchrotron whereas the gev range is dominated by fast cooling synchrotron .",
    "this last type of modelling was found also by @xcite who suggest that the cooling frequency at @xmath134s should be between @xmath135mev .",
    "an example of such modelling is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] ( upper right panel ) .",
    "for this burst we use the data at 277 seconds , taken from @xcite . for a homogeneous medium",
    "we find @xmath136 , @xmath137ergs , @xmath138 .",
    "for these ranges of parameters , the x - rays are always dominated by synchrotron ( either slow cooling for lower densities or fast cooling and ssc suppressed for larger densities ) , whereas the gev emission is dominated either by fast cooling synchrotron or by ssc ( for larger densities ) .",
    "these solutions are similar to those found with late time data . for a wind medium",
    "we also find allowed parameter space but with almost no overlap with the parameter space identified with the late time data .",
    "this favours a homogeneous medium .",
    "an example of modelling where the x - ray frequency is above @xmath21 but the x - ray flux is suppressed by ic and where the gev flux is produced by un - suppressed fast cooling synchrotron is shown in fig .",

    "for this burst we use the data at 25,000 seconds .",

    "we find @xmath139 , @xmath140ergs , @xmath141 . here , the x - rays are always dominated by synchrotron ( either slow cooling for lower densities or fast cooling and ssc suppressed for larger densities ) , whereas the gev emission is dominated either by fast cooling synchrotron or by ssc ( for larger densities ) .",
    "the allowed parameter space almost completely overlaps that obtained with the previously considered data set . for a wind medium",
    "two sets of parameters are found .",
    "the first , with @xmath142 , @xmath143ergs , @xmath144 .",
    "these parameters correspond x - rays dominated by slow cooling synchrotron and gev emission dominated by fast cooling synchrotron .",
    "another set of parameters is found with larger densities ( @xmath145 ) , smaller isotropic energies ( @xmath146ergs ) and similar values of @xmath15 . in this case , both the x - rays and the gev emission are dominated by ssc .",
    "both these sets of parameters are found also with the previous data set presented above .",
    "an example of modelling where the x - rays are dominated by slow cooling synchrotron and the gev by fast cooling synchrotron is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "we have considered all grbs detected both by lat and xrt , for which the gev emission lasts longer than the prompt and it decays as a power - law in time .",
    "we have analyzed the late time ( around @xmath147s ) gev radiation and the late time ( around @xmath1day ) x - ray and optical radiation ( optical observations are available for 8 out of the 10 bursts in our sample ) . assuming that all these emissions are produced by electrons in the shocked circumburst medium we have estimated the conditions at this shock and have elaborated on the exact radiation process .",
    "we modeled the broad band observations as radiation from the forward external shock under two different assumptions for the external density : constant ( ism ) and wind - like .",
    "we derived synchrotron and ssc spectra ( accounting for the role of kn suppression ) and compared the simulated seds with observations .",
    "while we fix @xmath148 we have allowed all the other parameters to vary over a wide range of values .",
    "we have found that for all bursts in our sample it is possible to account for the broad band ( optical to gev or at least x - ray to gev ) observations within the forward shock model .",
    "for each burst we have found a range of possible solutions , which can be classified into two families , depending on the position of @xmath149 as compared to @xmath21 .",
    "in general , low densities and low @xmath15 ( @xmath150 ) correspond to a high cooling frequency , above the x - ray band .",
    "contrary to the electrons emitting x - rays , gev radiating electrons are in the fast cooling regime and @xmath149 and @xmath151 do not lie in the same portion of the synchrotron spectrum . in this case",
    "the gev flux is a better proxy for the kinetic energy , since the x - ray flux depends not only on @xmath35 and @xmath32 but also on @xmath16 and @xmath15 .",
    "since most of the synchrotron spectrum is produced by slow cooling electrons , these solutions require , in general , large energies . for larger values of @xmath15 and/or larger densities",
    "the cooling frequency falls below @xmath149 . in this case",
    "both the x - rays and gev photons are in the high energy part of the spectrum and in order to account for the relatively low x - ray flux as compared to the gev flux , the x - ray flux must be suppressed via ssc cooling , while , because of the kn suppression , the gev flux is not similarly suppressed . also in these solutions , the gev flux is a better proxy for the kinetic energy as compared to the inverse compton suppressed x - ray flux , whose value depends on the compton parameter and hence indirectly on density and @xmath15 .",
    "even if the modeling within the forward shock model is successful , only limits to the values of the unknown parameters can be inferred , due to the degeneracy among these parameters .",
    "wind solutions exist for all the explored range of densities ( @xmath152 ) . on",
    "the other hand ism requires @xmath153 . for @xmath16 and @xmath154 in the range 0.1 - 10 ,",
    "the largest possible values for @xmath15 vary in the range @xmath155 , and the upper limits on the amplification factors of the magnetic field beyond shock compression are @xmath112 .",
    "the lower limits derived on @xmath35 are always larger than the estimates derived using the standard assumption that the x - ray flux around one day is above @xmath21 and that it is not affected by inverse compton cooling .",
    "the inferred values of the kinetic energy are sometimes large , but they reflect the isotropic equivalent energy , and not the true energy of the blast wave . moreover , we are considering here a sample of very energetic bursts , among the most energetic ever detected .",
    "their energetics are not representative of the whole sample , since they likely belong to the high - energy tail of the population .",
    "the lower limits on @xmath35 translate into upper limits on the efficiency of the prompt mechanism @xmath156 .",
    "these upper limits are always less than @xmath157 .",
    "the values of the magnetic field inferred in our analysis are only slightly above the values that would arise from a simple shock compression of the magnetic field .",
    "it is interesting to note that our results are in line with a recent proposal by @xcite . in this work",
    "@xcite suggest that shocks amplify the magnetic field significantly ( this is required for particle acceleration within these shocks ) .",
    "however , the downstream magnetic field decreases rapidly with the distance from the shock .",
    "in this case the optical and x - ray observations probe values of the magnetic field far from the shock . the gev emitting electrons cool rapidly in a region closer to the shock , where the magnetic field is still large .",
    "however , as the gev , fast cooling , flux is almost independent of the magnetic field , the value of @xmath15 used to model gev radiation does not affect too much the results .",
    "a good modeling can be found by using the same , small @xmath15 for optical , x - ray and gev observations , with minor corrections to the gev flux in the scenario outlined by @xcite .",
    "the sample considered in this work includes only bursts with temporally extended emission detected by lat .",
    "it is unclear whether or not these bursts are intrinsically different from bursts without gev emission and represent a separated population .",
    "however , we note that the bursts detected in the gev range are generally the brightest ones in the sub - mev range @xcite .",
    "this supports the possibility that this kind of emission is typically present in grbs , but it can be detected only for the most fluent bursts , being below the lat detection threshold for fainter grbs . if this is the case , then the bursts studied in this paper are not intrinsically different from the general population of grbs .",
    "if they are part of the same population , this triggers the question of whether our results ( very low @xmath15 , x - ray flux either below @xmath21 or suppressed by ssc , and prompt efficiencies around @xmath158 ) can be extended to the whole population or not .",
    "of course , since the requirement of lat detection selects only the brightest bursts , the kinetic energies involved in their afterglow blast waves are not representative of the whole population .",
    "concerning the tendency to have very low @xmath15 values , we note that there is no reason to imagine a bias towards small values introduced by the study of a sample of bright bursts .",
    "the selection criterion is based on the detection in an energy range ( @xmath94gev ) that lies above @xmath21 , where the flux is very weakly dependent on @xmath15 : @xmath159 .",
    "this implies that if a selection bias exists , it goes in the opposite direction , since the gev afterglow flux would be larger for higher values of @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , two grbs with the same kinetic energy but very different @xmath15 would have very similar gev fluxes , and then the same probability to be detected by lat .",
    "we also note that small values of @xmath15 have been derived also in recent studies of larger samples of bursts without gev radiation ( @xcite ; see also the exercise of not including gev data in the afterglow modelling of bursts detected in the gev in @xcite ) .",
    "it is not easy to understand why recent works ( with and without lat data ) are highlighting the existence of @xmath15 values much smaller that those derived in previous analysis .",
    "we can speculate that , at least in cases where data are not sufficient to break the degeneracy between the several free parameters ( especially @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) solutions corresponding to very small @xmath15 values are usually discarded , in favour of values considered more standard .",
    "moreover , also in those cases where the free parameters are all constrained by the data , addition of gev data obviously brings some new information and opens a region of the parameter space which is usually not investigated when high - energy observation are missing .",
    "in fact , as we have proved in this work , gev data are inconsistent with being a simple extrapolation of the x - ray data , and this rules out large @xmath15 values , in favour of smaller values .",
    "small values of @xmath15 require a proper treatment of the ic cooling and kn effects .",
    "these effects modify the shape of the synchrotron spectrum and allow us to recover a satisfactorily modelling of the broad band data and to explain the apparent inconsistency between x - ray and gev fluxes .",
    "our results , together with results from samples without lat detection , suggest that the distribution of @xmath15 in the forward external shocks of grbs is wider than what is usually believed , possibly rangingall the way down to @xmath160 .",
    "the availability of lat data affects not only the estimate of @xmath15 , but also the estimates of the blast wave kinetic energy ( and then , the estimates of the prompt efficiency ) .",
    "also in this case , it is interesting to compare estimates derived by including and excluding lat data . in our sample ,",
    "the efficiencies derived from x - ray alone agree with results found for other bursts , i.e. large values close to unity (  [ efficiency ] ) .",
    "again , only the inclusion of lat data forces the modelling to prefer higher values of the kinetic energy , lowering the efficiency requirement on the prompt mechanism .",
    "the fact that the gev detected bursts , which are most energetic indicate low efficiency during the prompt phase , suggests that the results are generic .",
    "otherwise why would the brightest burst be also the least efficient ?",
    "regardless of whether or not these results can be extended to a large sample of bursts , our study outlines the need to perform broad band afterglow modeling in order to properly infer important properties like the energetics and the efficiency , and put constraints on the nature of the emission mechanisms in grbs .",

    "<S> we model the data ( accounting also for optical detections around @xmath1day , if available ) to unveil the reason for this discrepancy and find that good modelling within the forward shock model is always possible and leads to two possibilities : either the x - ray emitting electrons ( unlike the gev emitting electrons ) are in the slow cooling regime or ii ) the x - ray synchrotron flux is strongly suppressed by compton cooling , whereas , due to the klein - nishina suppression , this effect is much smaller at gev energies . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray flux is no longer a robust proxy for the blast wave kinetic energy . on average , </S>",
    "<S> both cases require weak magnetic fields ( @xmath3 ) and relatively large isotropic kinetic blast wave energies @xmath4 corresponding to large lower limits on the collimated energies , in the range @xmath5 for an ism environment with @xmath6 and @xmath7 for a wind environment with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> these energies are larger than those estimated from the x - ray flux alone , and imply smaller inferred values of the prompt efficiency mechanism , reducing the efficiency requirements on the still uncertain mechanism responsible for prompt emission .    </S>",
