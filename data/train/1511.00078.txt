    "exactly like the lorentz transformations of space time coordinates in the inertial frame @xcite , the rindler coordinate transformations are for the uniformly accelerated frame of references @xcite . from the references",
    "@xcite , it can very easily be shown that the rindler coordinate transformations are given by : @xmath1 hence it is a matter of simple algebra to prove that the inverse transformations are given by : @xmath2 here @xmath3 indicates the uniform acceleration of the frame .",
    "hence it can very easily be shown from eqns.(1 ) and ( 2 ) that the square of the four - line element changes from @xmath4 where the former line element is in the minkowski space .",
    "hence the metric in the rindler space can be written as @xmath5 whereas in the minkowski space - time we have the usual form @xmath6 it is therefore quite obvious that the rindler space is also flat .",
    "the only difference from the minkowski space is that the frame of the observer is moving with uniform acceleration .",
    "it has been noticed from the literature survey , that the principle of equivalence plays an important role in obtaining the rindler coordinates in the uniformly accelerated frame of reference .",
    "according to this principle an accelerated frame in absence of gravity is equivalent to a frame at rest in presence of a gravity .",
    "therefore in the present scenario , @xmath3 may be treated to be the strength of constant gravitational field for a frame at rest .",
    "now from the relativistic dynamics of special theory of relativity @xcite , the action integral is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 is the rest mass of the particle and @xmath10 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the lagrangian of the particle may be written as @xmath11^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the three velocity vector .",
    "hence the three momentum of the particle is given by @xmath13 @xmath14^{1/2}}\\ ] ] then from the definition , the hamiltonian of the particle may be written as @xmath15 @xmath16 hence it can very easily be shown that in the non - relativistic approximation , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath17 in the classical level , the quantities @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are treated as dynamical variables .",
    "further , it can very easily be verified that in the quantum mechanical scenario where these quantities are considered to be operators , the hamiltonian @xmath18 is not hermitian .",
    "however the energy eigen spectrum for the schrdinger equation has been observed to be real @xcite .",
    "this is found to be solely because of the fact that @xmath18 is @xmath0-invariant .",
    "now it is well know that @xmath21 , @xmath22 , whereas , @xmath23 and @xmath24 but @xmath25 , therefore it is a matter of simple algebra to show that @xmath26 . as has been shown by several authors @xcite that",
    "if @xmath18 is @xmath0-invariant , then the energy eigen values will be real . here",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are respectively the parity and the time reversal operators .",
    "further if the hamiltonian is @xmath0 symmetric , then @xmath18 and @xmath0 should have common eigen states . in @xcite",
    "we have noticed that the solution of the schr@xmath29dinger equation is obtained in terms of the variable @xmath30 , which is @xmath0-symmetric .",
    "hence any function , e.g. , whittaker function @xmath31 or associated laguerre function @xmath32 , the solution of the schrdinger equation are @xmath0-symmetric .",
    "these polynomials are also the eigen functions of the operator @xmath0 .",
    "of course with the replacement of hermiticity of the hamiltonian with the @xmath0-symmetry , we have not discarded the important quantum mechanical key features of the system described by this hamiltonian and also kept the canonical quantization rule invariant , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "this point was also discussed in an elaborate manner in reference @xcite and in some of the references cited there .    in this article",
    "we have investigated the time evolution for both the space and the momentum coordinates of the particle moving in rindler space .",
    "we have considered both the relativistic and the non - relativistic form of the rindler hamiltonian ( eqns.(11 ) and ( 11a ) respectively ) .",
    "hence we shall also obtain the classical phase space trajectories for the particle in the rindler space .",
    "we have noticed that in the relativistic scenario , both the spatial and the momentum coordinates are real in nature and diverge as @xmath34 . for both the variables the time dependencies",
    "are extremely simple .",
    "hence we have obtained classical trajectories @xmath35 by eliminating the time dependent part .    however , in the non - relativistic approximation , the spatial coordinates are quite complex in nature , whereas the momentum coordinates are purely imaginary .",
    "since the mathematical form of the phase space trajectories are quite complicated , we have obtained @xmath35 numerically in the non - relativistic scenario .    in the first part of this article",
    ", we have considered the relativistic picture and obtained the phase space trajectories , whereas in the second part , the classical phase space structure is obtained for non - relativistic case . to the best of our knowledge",
    "such studies have not been done before",
    "we next consider the non - relativistic form of rindler hamiltonian given by eqn.(11a ) . now following eqn.(12 ) ,",
    "the equations of motion for the particle in rindler space in the non - relativistic approximation are given by @xmath55 on integrating the second one we have @xmath56 the particle momentum is therefore purely imaginary in nature with its real part @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath43 is a real constant phase .",
    "next evaluating the first integral analytically , we have @xmath58 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & i\\frac{c}{\\omega}\\left [ \\sin\\left \\{\\ln \\left ( \\sin^2\\left ( \\frac{2^{1/2}\\omega t-\\phi}{2 } \\right ) \\right ) \\right \\ } \\right ] = x_r+ix_i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the spatial part is therefore complex in nature , where the real part @xmath59\\ ] ] and the corresponding imaginary part is given by @xmath60\\ ] ] here again eliminating the time part , we have the mathematical form of phase space trajectories for the imaginary parts only @xmath61^{1/2 } } { \\exp\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}\\sin^{-1}\\left ( \\frac{\\omega}{c}x_i\\right ) \\right \\ } } \\ ] ] which gives the phase space trajectories of the particle in the rindler space in non - relativistic scenario . it should be noted here that since the real part of the particle momentum is zero , we have considered the imaginary parts only . since @xmath62 is real , therefore @xmath63 , i.e. , can not have all possible values .    in fig.(2 )",
    "we have plotted the scaled @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 with scaled time @xmath66 for @xmath67 . since the constant phase @xmath43 is completely arbitrary , for the sake of illustration we have chosen it to be zero . in this diagram the scaling factors are also taken to be unity . now if we consider variation of the scaling factors , the qualitative nature of the graphs will not change but there will be quantitative changes . in fig.(3 ) we have plotted the scaled @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath69 with scaled time @xmath66 for @xmath67 . in this case",
    "also same type of changes as has been mentioned for @xmath64 will be observed . in fig.(4 ) we have plotted the scaled @xmath62 , which is actually @xmath70 with scaled time @xmath66 for @xmath67 . in this case also the scaling factors are exactly equal to one .",
    "further the same kind of variation as mentioned above will be observed for @xmath62 with the change of scaling parameters . finally in fig.(5 )",
    "the phase space trajectory for scaled @xmath68 and scaled @xmath62 is shown since the physically accepted domain for scaled @xmath68 is from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , we have shown in figs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) the plot of scaled @xmath68 and scaled @xmath62 with scaled time .",
    "finally in conclusion we would like to mention that to the best of our knowledge this is the first time the phase space trajectories are obtained in rindler space using non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian .    in the relativistic case the trajectories can be represented by a set of hyperbolas .",
    "whereas in the non - relativistic picture , particle momenta are purely imaginary and the space coordinates are complex in nature .",
    "the variation of real and imaginary parts of space coordinates are quite complicated .",
    "further , the phase space is restricted within the domain of negative @xmath19-values .",
    "the imaginary part of particle momentum has been observed to change with time in a discrete manner in this region .    if we consider the rindler hamiltonian in the form @xmath73 then it is a matter of simple algebra to show that @xmath74 hence redifining @xmath75 as new @xmath19 and @xmath76 as new @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 , which gives the phase space trajectories in rindler space .",
