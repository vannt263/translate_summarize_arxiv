    "the issue of quarkonium production mechanism is an open question as none of theoretical models which are used to describe the non - perturbative transformation of the @xmath2 pair into quarkonium i.e. the color singlet modeal ( csm)@xcite@xcite , color evaporation model ( cem)@xcite and non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd)@xcite , is able to explain satisfactorily all the data on both production cross section and polarization measurements .",
    "thus , independent tests other than polarization measurements are needed to compare the different production mechanisms .",
    "one such possible test is transverse single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) in charmonium production@xcite since the asymmetry in heavy quarkonium production is very sensitive to the production mechanism@xcite .",
    "one of the theoretical approaches that has been used to explain these asymmetries in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) and drell yan ( dy ) processes is based on a transverse momentum dependent factorization scheme@xcite which involves transverse momentum dependent parton densities and fragmentation functions collectively referred to as tmd s .",
    "one such tmd of great interest is sivers function which gives the probability of finding an unpolarized parton inside a transversly polarized nucleon .    in an earlier work ,",
    "we proposed that transverse ssa in charmonium production can be used to study sivers effect@xcite .",
    "we presented first estimates of ssa in photoproduction ( i.e. low virtuality electroproduction ) of charmonium in scattering of electrons off transversely polarized protons using cem . in the process that we considered , at lo , there is contribution only from a single partonic subprocess and hence , it can be used as a clean probe of gluon sivers function .",
