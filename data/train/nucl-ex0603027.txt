    "the symmetry energy and its density dependence have received increasing attention in recent years because of their importance for nuclear structure and for astrophysics .",
    "supernova simulations or neutron star models require inputs for the nuclear equation of state at extreme values of density and asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the strength of the symmetry term at about normal density is quite well known from the masses of finite nuclei but its density dependence is experimentally very poorly constrained .",
    "theoretical predictions are quite consistent for low - density nuclear matter @xcite but diverge considerably at higher density where they are important for astrophysical phenomena as , e.g. , the cooling of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "nuclear reactions offer the possibility to investigate nuclear matter at densities other than normal nuclear density , and an active search for observables suited to probe the strength of the symmetry term in reaction experiments is presently underway @xcite .",
    "multifragmentation is generally considered a low - density phenomenon .",
    "however , the short - range nature of the nuclear forces causes a clustering in nuclear systems that have expanded as a result of an initial compression or heating in the course of a violent nuclear collision .",
    "nuclear matter is not homogeneous under such conditions and the strength of the symmetry term is thus not easy to predict . in statistical multifragmentation models",
    ", it is assumed that normal - density fragments are distributed within an expanded volume .",
    "the density is only low on average , and standard liquid - drop parameters are used to describe the nascent fragments including their isotopic degrees of freedom . in the copenhagen version of this model ( smm ) , the symmetry energy term @xmath8 is used with coefficients in the range @xmath3  23 to 25  mev @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the strength of the symmetry term under such conditions is of particular interest because the subnuclear densities and the temperatures reached at the freeze - out in fragmentation reactions overlap with those expected for the explosion stages of core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "this similarity permits laboratory studies of the properties of nuclear matter in the hot environment similar to the astrophysical situation .",
    "nuclear matter in equilibrium at low density is expected to consist of nuclei with a wide range of masses and with properties that dependent strongly on the global parameters of temperature , density , proton fraction and , in particular , also on the strength of the symmetry term under these conditions ( fig .",

    "isotopic scaling , also termed isoscaling , has been shown to be a phenomenon common to many different types of heavy ion reactions @xcite . it is observed by comparing product yields from otherwise identical reactions with isotopically different projectiles or targets , and it is constituted by an exponential dependence of the yield ratios @xmath14 measured for the two reactions on the neutron number @xmath15 and proton number @xmath16 of the produced fragments .",
    "the scaling expression @xmath17 describes rather well the measured ratios for a wide range of complex particles and light fragments @xcite .    in the grand - canonical approximation , assuming that the temperature @xmath18 is about the same , the scaling parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are proportional to the differences of the neutron and proton chemical potentials for the two systems , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "of particular interest is the proportionality of the scaling parameters with the symmetry energy term .",
    "it has been obtained from the statistical interpretation of isoscaling within the smm @xcite and expanding - emitting - source model @xcite and confirmed by an analysis of reaction dynamics @xcite .",
    "the relation is @xmath23 where @xmath24,@xmath25 and @xmath26,@xmath27 are the charges and mass numbers of the two systems .",
    "the difference of the chemical potential depends essentially only on the coefficient @xmath28 of the symmetry term and on the isotopic compositions .",
    "there is a simple physical explanation within the smm why isoscaling should appear in finite systems .",
    "charge distributions of fragments with fixed mass numbers @xmath29 , as well as mass distributions for fixed @xmath16 , are approximately gaussian with average values and variances which are connected with the temperature , the symmetry coefficient , and other parameters .",
    "the mean values depend on the total mass and charge of the systems , e.g. via the chemical potentials in the grand canonical approximation , while the variances depend mainly on the physical conditions reached , the temperature , the density and possibly other variables .",
    "for example , the charge variance @xmath30 obtained for fragments with a given mass number @xmath29 in ref .",
    "@xcite is only a function of the temperature and of the symmetry term coefficient since the coulomb contribution is very small .",
    "the above relation opens the possibility for an experimental program for studying the evolution of the role of the symmetry term for the fragment formation as a function of the conditions of the experiment . besides the isoscaling coefficient ,",
    "the required inputs are the temperatures at breakup and the difference of the neutron - to - proton ratios @xmath31 of the two systems .",
    "an encouraging result was obtained when this method was first applied to the data of light - ion ( p , d , @xmath19 ) induced reactions at relativistic energies of up to 15 gev @xcite .",
