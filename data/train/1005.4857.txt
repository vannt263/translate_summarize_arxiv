    "we consider the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer - like ( bcs - like ) ( bardeen _ et al .",
    "_ 1957 ) phonon - mediated pairing of electrons in graphene , and the coulomb pairing of electrons and holes in graphene bilayer , taking into account the unusual electron dynamics .",
    "several possibilities for electron pairing phenomena in graphene were proposed .",
    "one possibility is the pairing of spontaneously created electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band , leading to the excitonic insulator state ( khveshchenko 2001 ) .",
    "the results of numerical simulations in the recent papers ( see , e.g. , drut & lhde ( 2008 ) , armour _ et al . _",
    "( 2009 ) ) show that graphene can turn into excitonic insulator state while being suspended in vacuum .",
    "another possibility is electron - electron pairing in graphene layer , mediated either by phonons , plasmons ( uchoa & castro neto 2007 ) , or by coulomb interaction , acting as attractive in certain channels ( i.e. resonating valence bond mechanisms , proposed by black - schaffer & doniach ( 2007 ) , honerkamp ( 2008 ) , or anisotropic electron scattering near van hove singularity by gonzlez ( 2008 ) ) .",
    "the other two possible mechanisms of establishing a coherent state in graphene are the proximity - induced superconductivity ( heersche _ et al .",

    "we demonstrate that each phonon mode in graphene provides a contribution to effective electron - electron interaction , dependent on both its symmetry and the structure of the order parameter with respect to electron valleys .",
    "estimates of the coupling constants show that out - of - plane phonons do not cause a pairing with any observable critical temperatures , however the in - plane optical phonons can lead to the pairing in heavily doped graphene .",
    "electron - hole pairing in graphene bilayer in the weak coupling regime is of bcs type , and affects only the conduction band of the electron - doped graphene layer and the valence band of the hole - doped layer ( lozovik & sokolik 2008__a _ _ ) . on increase of the coupling strength ,",

    "however the estimates using unscreened interaction , or with the statically screened interaction , but within the multi - band model , provide much larger values of the critical temperature ( min _ et al .",

    "using the spectral representations of @xmath144 and @xmath145 in ( [ bl_sc1 ] ) and summing over @xmath146 at @xmath87 , we get the eliashberg - type equations : @xmath147 we assume that @xmath148 is real ( it is well - justified near @xmath125 ) , therefore @xmath149 .",
    "then , we assume that the argument of the @xmath150-function in this expression vanishes at some unambiguous @xmath151 .",
    "this allows us to handle only `` on - shell '' gap functions and bogolyubov energies : @xmath152 , @xmath153 . rewriting ( [ bl_sc2 ] ) in terms of the on - shell quantities and assuming @xmath154 , @xmath155 in its left - hand side , we get : @xmath156 here we also neglected @xmath157 in the second term in the braces .    to demonstrate the influence of dynamical screening of @xmath124 on the gap value",
    ", we will simplify the equation ( [ bl_sc3 ] ) further .",
    "firstly , we suppose that the both on - shell gap functions @xmath158 are equal to each other ; this seems plausible at large @xmath159 , as discussed by lozovik & sokolik 2010 , and allows us to neglect the angular factor @xmath160 in ( [ bl_sc3 ] ) . secondly , we assume @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the gap at the fermi surface and @xmath163 is some trial function , equal to 1 at @xmath155 and having the asymptotics @xmath164 at @xmath165 , caused by the leading contribution of the unscreened coulomb interaction in ( [ bl_sc2 ] ) . for computational purposes",

    "thus , the equation ( [ bl_sc3 ] ) for the gap reduces to : @xmath169    the expression in braces in ( [ bl_sc4 ] ) is the effective on - shell interaction , which incorporates the effects of dynamical screening of the pairing interaction .",
    "it differs from the statically screened interaction @xmath124 , employed by lozovik & sokolik 2009 , lozovik & sokolik 2010 and is naturally divided into three contributions ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) : a ) attractive unscreened coulomb interaction , b ) repulsive contribution due to virtual undamped higher - branch plasmons , c ) repulsive contribution due to virtual damped higher - branch plasmons and single - particle intra- and interband excitation continuums at @xmath170 and @xmath171 respectively ( wunsch _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 , hwang & das sarma 2007 ) .",
    "however , strictly on the fermi surface ( at @xmath172 , @xmath155 ) the effective on - shell interaction coincides with the statically - screened one .    assuming that the characteristic momentum , at which the on - shell gap @xmath78 decays , is of the order of the fermi momentum and employing @xmath173 as a trial function",

    "taking into account only the unscreened coulomb attraction results in huge gap values , reported previously by min _",
    "( 2008 ) , zhang & joglekar ( 2008 ) .",
    "the addition of the undamped plasmons repulsive contribution eliminates the logarithmic singularity of the effective interaction on the fermi momentum ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , but do not change the gap values essentially at large @xmath159 .",
    "finally , the contribution of the damped plasmons and and single - particle excitations lowers the gap down to the values of the order of @xmath175 at maximum ( several kelvins at @xmath176 ) .",
    "when the on - shell interaction is replaced by the statically screened one @xmath177 , the gap is unobservably small , if we use the trial function @xmath163 , spread over the momentums of the order of @xmath178 ; this is in argeement with the bcs - type estimates by kharitonov & efetov ( 2008__a , b _ _ ) .",
    "however , as shown by lozovik & sokolik ( 2009 ) , the pairing tend to occupy much larger region of the momentums of the order of @xmath179 and results in large gap values , if we use the statically screened potential as the pairing potential . in our case , when we take into account the dynamical effects and naturally assume that the on - shell gaps @xmath78 decay at @xmath180 , the gap turns out to take the values , several orders of magnitude smaller than these with unscreened coulomb interaction , but , at the same time , several orders of magnitude larger than the bcs - type estimates .",
    "we have considered electron - electron pairing in graphene , mediated by in - plane and out - of - plane phonons , and electron - hole pairing in graphene bilayer , mediated by the screened coulomb interaction . in both cases",
    "we consider the generally multi - band pairing with the @xmath181-wave order parameter , diagonal with respect to valence and conduction bands of paired particles .",

    "we demonstrate that contributions of different phonon modes in graphene to effective electron - electron interaction , entering the eliashberg - type equations , depend both on symmetries of these modes and on the structure of the order parameter in valley space .",
    "the coupling of graphene electrons with out - of - plane ( flexural ) phonon modes is quadratic and leads to unusual form of effective electron - electron phonon - mediated interaction , which includes integration on frequency and integration on momentum over the whole brillouin zone within the phonon loop .",
    "the estimates of effective coupling constants show that the pairing due to in - plane phonon modes can occur at high doping of graphene , while the pairing due to out - of - plane phonons does not occur at observable temperatures .",
    "eliashberg - type equations for electron - hole pairing in graphene bilayer , written in the present paper in terms of the `` on - shell '' gap functions , allow to estimate the role of dynamical effects .",
    "the effective on - shell dynamically screened interaction , entering the gap equations , can be represented as a sum of attractive unscreened coulomb interaction , repulsive contribution due to undamped virtual plasmons and combined repulsive contribution of the damped plasmons and of the continuum of single - particle excitations .    the unscreened coulomb interaction on its own provides large values of the gap , which are only slightly reduced with taking into account the undamped plasmons .",
