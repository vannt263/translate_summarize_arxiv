    "the classification of quantum states of the harmonic oscillator according to classical / non - classical and gaussian / non - gaussian paradigms has been an ongoing focus of research in quantum information for some time now .",
    "a number of criteria for the detection of non - classicality have been introduced , based on phase - space distributions @xcite , ordered moments @xcite , and information - theoretic arguments @xcite . a particular attention has been devoted both in characterizing the set of states with positive wigner function @xcite and in distinguishing gaussian and non - gaussian states @xcite .",
    "the different measures of non - gaussianity proposed have been for example used to characterize experimentally generated non - gaussian states @xcite , but they could not discriminate between states that can be written as mixtures of gaussian states , and the so - defined _ quantum non - gaussian states_.    from a physical point of view this is a particularly important distinction , as quantum non - gaussian states can be only produced by means of highly non - linear processes , while states belonging to the gaussian convex hull can be generated by means of gaussian operations only and classical randomization . in @xcite the first attempt to detect quantum non - gaussianity was pursued , by deriving witnesses based respectively on photon - number probabilities and on the wigner function .",
    "the criterion @xcite has been already used to detect quantum non - gaussian states produced in different experimental settings @xcite .",
    "we here present a framework to derive qng witnesses based on generic linear functionals .",
    "we apply these results to the case of @xmath0-parametrized quasiprobability distributions , generalizing the criteria obtained in @xcite for the wigner function , to the husimi q - function ( @xmath1 ) and in general to any distribution characterized by a parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : qngintro ] we present the problem by defining qng , while section [ sec : convexity ] illustrates how to derive bounds of linear functionals on the gaussian convex hull , along with their most important properties . in section [ sec : qngcriteria ] we present sufficient but not necessary qng witnesses based on quasiprobability distributions . in section [ sec : c1 ] the effectiveness of these criteria are investigated for fock states , photon - added coherent states , and photon - subtracted squeezed states , focusing in particular on the performances corresponding to the different quasiprobability distributions considered . in section [ sec : error ] we illustrate how the uncertainty on the measured average photon number , propagates to the derived bounds , for different values of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper with final discussions and remarks .",
    "we begin by recalling the definition of the gaussian convex hull @xmath3 where @xmath4 can be an arbitrary probability distribution , @xmath5 are pure gaussian states and @xmath6 is the set of bounded operators . in general , all pure single - mode gaussian states can be parametrized as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the displacement and squeezing operators with the standard form presented in @xcite , @xmath10 is the vacuum state , @xmath11 are arbitrary complex numbers and @xmath12 .",
    "the set @xmath13 includes mixed gaussian states as they can always be decomposed in the form , but also non - gaussian states , that is states having a non - gaussian wigner function , as mixtures of coherent and squeezed states .    in line with refs .",
    "@xcite , _ a quantum state @xmath14 is defined quantum non - gaussian iff @xmath15 . _ to understand the importance of qng in quantum optics , consider a simple example : given a single - mode field initially prepared in the vacuum state , it is easy to verify that states belonging to @xmath16 can be prepared by applying a combination of gaussian operations and classical randomization .",
    "in contrast , the preparation of a quantum non - gaussian state @xmath17 starting from the vacuum field can only be achieved by means of some non - gaussian operation , such as the application of a highly non - linear hamiltonian ( i.e. more than quadratic in the mode operators ) or probabilistic non - gaussian operations as photon addition / subtraction @xcite .",
    "before proceeding to specialize our analysis to phase - space quasiprobability distributions , it is worthwhile to discuss the general approach we shall take in order to witness qng .",
    "suppose that a single - oscillator quantum state @xmath18 is the output of some experiment .",
    "assume that the data of our experiment allows us to estimate a certain quantity @xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 is a _ linear _ functional on the space of quantum states , and a bound @xmath21 on the average photon number , that is @xmath22}\\leq n$ ] .",

    "@xmath26 , we must conclude that @xmath28 ( conversely , finding @xmath19\\geq b(n)$ ] must be interpreted as an inconclusive result ) .",
    "a key step in this procedure is the calculation of the function @xmath26 for a given @xmath20 . in general , this can be seen as a problem of linear optimization over an infinite - dimensional parameter space [ see eq .  ] .",
    "luckily , the optimization can be dramatically simplified by exploting the properties of @xmath26 .",
    "it turns out that it is sufficient to look for the ( constrained ) minimum of @xmath20 amongst the set of _ pure _ gaussian states , and that of _ rank-2 _ mixtures of gaussian states .",
    "therefore , for a fixed @xmath20 and @xmath21 , only a finite number of parameters needs to be optimized in order to find @xmath26 .",

    "[ f : pacepsilon ] . however , we observe again evidence that there is a compromise between a tighter bound and the amount of violation quantified by the criterion @xmath55 , with the magnitude of the parameter decreasing for lower values of @xmath0",

    "( [ eq : witness2 ] ) . for the pac state",

    "[ eq : convolution ] .",
    "the bounds were found , and again demonstrate the same characteristics found with the other states . in this case ,",

    "[ f : pssepsilon ] ] . again , though , this represents a loss in the quantity of violation described by the parameter @xmath55 .",
    "similarly to how pac states inherit a displacement , pss states inherit additional squeezing on the evolved state , and we can use the optimized witness ( [ eq : witness2 ] ) by using additional squeezing operations . in this case",
    ", there is a difference between how the wigner function changes under this squeezing versus how the q function changes : while the wigner function at the origin is unchanged by the squeezing operation , the q function is not invariant and as a result the following argument for the optimization of the squeezing parameter is only valid for the wigner function .",
    "this proves not to be a problem , and will be discussed below .",
    "first , we determine the value @xmath108 that minimizes the average photon number of @xmath109 , @xmath110+\\nu^2_q,\\ ] ] where @xmath111 and for an initial pss state @xmath112 , @xmath113 in this case the optimal squeezing value can be evaluated analytically : @xmath114    we again follow the format of the pac state analysis , assigning the squeezing parameter its optimal value @xmath108 and plotting the criterion as a function of @xmath66 .",
    "we plot both the wigner and q functions for @xmath108 and illustrate that while the @xmath108 used is only optimized for the wigner function , the maximum noise @xmath70 for the q function for this value of @xmath0 is 1 for all values and therefore already giving the desired result .",
    "so even if this is not the optimal squeezing for the q function , it is sufficient to detect quantum non - gaussianity by means of the q function based witness .",
    "this feature is illustrated in fig . [",

    "while a full error propagation to evaluate the various witnesses is beyond the scope of this paper , it is straightforward to evaluate the bounds @xmath41 for the different @xmath0-values , based on uncertainty in the mean photon number @xmath21 .",

    "as we can observe , the errors on the different bounds @xmath41 are comparable .",
