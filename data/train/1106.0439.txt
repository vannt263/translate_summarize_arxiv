    "dynamics at such networks can be qualitatively and quantitatively different from that at regular lattices ( see @xcite ) .    the ising model at a network with a hierarchical topology was studied by komosa and hoyst @xcite .",
    "the analyzed parameters were , among others , magnetization , magnetic susceptibility , critical temperature and correlations of magnetization between different hierarchies .",
    "it was shown that the critical temperature is a power function of the network size and of the ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath1 stands for a node degree .",

    "the idea behind this model is similar to the game of go and it takes into account a natural leaning of people to avoid being surrounded by members of another ( potentially hostile ) community @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the model of communities isolation studied for chains , hypercubic , random and scale - free networks @xcite to hierarchical networks proposed by @xcite .",
    "the model of hierarchical networks was proposed by ravasz and barabsi @xcite and modified by suchecki and hoyst @xcite .",

    "the dependence on the degree of hierarchy @xmath55 ( and on the network size ) is weak , what can be explained by the fact , that increasing the degree of hierarchy @xmath55 is a process similar to system rescaling , therefore @xmath76    for @xmath27 , the parameter @xmath37 can be analytically found : @xmath77 .",

    "the number of isolated nodes was calculated using the following approximation : all blocked nodes were blocked alone , i.e. they do not neighbor with other blocked nodes ( of the same community ) .",
    "although this approximation might seem coarse , resulting analytical predictions turned out to be in quite good agreement with simulated data @xcite . for modular hierarchical networks",
    ", such an approximation would not be reasonable . because of the fact that at the lowest level of hierarchy such networks consist of cliques of @xmath5 nodes , the most probable are situations when @xmath78 nodes are simultaneously blocked .",

    "the distribution @xmath26 is a polynomial of degree @xmath85 ( see eq . [ eqn : tcdist_p0 ] ) and the average @xmath80 is a scaled difference of two euler beta functions ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : avgtc_p0 ] ) . the average @xmath86 decreases with @xmath55 and for a fixed @xmath55 it reaches a minimum for @xmath87 ( see fig .",

    "for @xmath39 the distribution @xmath82 reaches a constant , non - zero value for @xmath88 $ ] ( for @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) , which means that processes when blocked clusters firstly appear at the very end of the evolution are not unlikely .",
    "the values of @xmath86 can be compared with those obtained for hypercubic networks .",
    "similar trends can be observed in hypercubic and hierarchical networks : @xmath86 decreases with the network size @xmath91 and increases with the average degree .",
