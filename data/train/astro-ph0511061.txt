    "the new generation of ground - based high - resolution cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments ( e.g. , the atacama cosmology telescope [ act;@xcite ] and the south pole telescope [ spt;@xcite ] ) , are designed to scan with very high sensitivity and arcminute resolution the microwave sky . their main goal is the study of the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( tsz ) effect @xcite : the change of frequency of cmb photons due to inverse compton scattering by hot electrons .",
    "such hot electron plasma are known to be found in clusters of galaxies , and should also be present in larger structures , such as filaments and superclusters of galaxies .",
    "this scattering translates into a redshift independent distortion of the cmb black body spectrum , making the tsz effect an ideal tool to probe the baryon distribution in the large scales of our universe at different cosmic epochs .",
    "however , this is not the only effect of an electron plasma on the cmb radiation .",
    "if a cloud of electrons is moving with some bulk velocity with respect to the cmb frame , then thomson scattering by these electrons will imprint new ( doppler induced ) temperature fluctuations on the cmb photons .",
    "this is the so called kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( ksz , @xcite ) , which is spectrally indistinguishable from the intrinsic cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "although the ksz effect is typically an order of magnitude smaller than the tsz in clusters of galaxies ( and for this reason much harder to detect ) , it encodes precious cosmological information since it depends on the peculiar velocity field .",
    "indeed , ksz measurements can yield valuable information about the large - scale velocity field , the evolution of the dark matter potential , and the growth of fluctuations .",
    "the study of large scale velocity fields ( cosmic flows ) has been an active research area in the nineties .",
    "there have been numerous attempts to measure bulk flows using the large - scale distribution of galaxies and their peculiar velocities , and to place constraints on the matter power spectrum or the universe matter density , ( see reviews of @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) . however , it became clear that these measurements had to be corrected for systematic errors , such as the biases introduced when calibrating the distances of the galaxies under study , or the non linear components of the velocities of those objects . with ksz observations , by using clusters as tracers of the velocity fields ,",
    "one is more confident to probe larger ( less non - linear ) scales .    while there have been no ksz detections to date , upper limits on the peculiar velocities of individual clusters",
    "have been reported by @xcite .",
    "such a difficult measurement could in principle be hampered by other effects such as non - linearities and the complicated physics of the intra - cluster gas .",
    "@xcite have shown that the ksz is not diluted by the internal velocity dispersion in the intracluster gas .",
    "@xcite calculated the temperature fluctuations produced by the ksz in the non - linear regime using the halo model .",
    "@xcite showed that the signal - to - noise of a ksz measurement should be distance independent and suggested combining signals from different redshifts . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have discussed how to extract the ksz signal from maps , while @xcite used n - body simulations to build templates of ksz maps in the context of the planck mission , and @xcite study the possibility of extracting the ksz dipole from cmb surveys covering a large fraction of the sky . due to its weak signal ,",
    "indirect detection of the ksz has been proposed through cross - correlation techniques with weak - lensing @xcite or old galaxies @xcite . as we shall see below",
    ", a measurement of the ksz effect would be very valuable , since it would not only allow us to measure bulk flows of clusters of galaxies and test the predictions of the standard model , but also provide additional constraints on cosmological parameters , especially on the equation of state of dark energy .    in this paper",
    "we compute the correlation function and the power spectrum of the ksz effect .",
    "this requires modeling of the peculiar velocity field and the cluster population .",
    "we explore the prospects for future cmb experiments to measure the ksz correlation function , and find that act - like experiments should be able to detect the ksz - induced cmb variance at high ( @xmath2 ) significance level .",
    "further , we study the dependence of the ksz correlation function on the cosmological parameters , and show that it can be used to measure the equation of state of dark energy ( @xmath1 ) _ if _ the redshifts of the clusters of galaxies detected in cmb surveys are available .",
    "we find that , with the salt follow up of act data or with a wider but shallower ( spt - like ) survey , the @xmath1 parameter can be constrained with an accuracy of 8% for an act scan of 400 square degrees .",
    "this error should scale inversely with the square root of the covered area and hence becomes 5% for a 1,000 square degree area .",
    "these determinations of @xmath1 do not rely on the knowledge of cluster masses , but do rely on clusters redshifts and reasonable assumptions on cluster physics .",
    "unless otherwise stated , throughout this work we shall asume a lcdm cosmological model @xcite with @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we study the statistical properties of the projected peculiar velocity field and provide an analytical expression for the correlation function of projected velocities . in section 3",
    "we compare the ksz and tsz effects , and discuss the strategy to enhance the probabilities of detecting the former . in section 4 we compute the correlation function and the power spectrum of the ksz , both when we consider only a given set of clusters present in a survey or the whole celestial sphere . in section 5 we outline two methods to estimate the ksz effect in future cmb cluster surveys and in section 6 we explore the dependence of ksz measurements on cosmological parameters making particular emphasis on @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude in section 7 .",
    "while the measurement of the ksz effect of individual clusters is difficult ( e.g.,@xcite ) , in this paper we address the prospects for statistical detection of cluster peculiar velocities in future cmb surveys .",
    "this requires the knowledge of the ensemble properties of the velocity field traced by the galaxy cluster population , to which we devote the current section . for clarity and future reference , a statistical description of the linear velocity field and related quantities",
    "is given in appendix a. + throughout this paper , we shall assume that the measured velocity field obeys linear theory .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , this is not completely fulfilled by cluster velocities , since clusters are peculiar tracers of the large scale matter distribution and show _ biased _ velocities compared to the expectations provided by the linear theory .",
    "@xcite found that this bias was typically a 30% - 40% effect .",
    "although several attempts have been made to model this boost in terms of the underlying density field @xcite , in subsequent sections it will be accounted for by simply increasing the cluster velocities by a factor @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a theoretical calculation of the detectability of the signal and the forecasted signal - to - noise : detailed comparison with numerical simulations are left to future work .",
    "full treatment can be implemented only with the help of numerical simulations matched to a given observing program(see",
    "@xcite for a recent study ) . we must stress that , although some modelling of non - linear effects must be included in this study , clusters are the largest virialised structures known in the universe , and probe much bigger scales than galaxies",
    ". therefore we must expect them to be significantly better tracers of the linear velocity field .",
    "furthermore , as we shall see below , the peculiar velocity estimator ( the ksz effect ) does _ not _ depend of distance , which avoids the need to use redshift - independent distance indicators , as opposed to other peculiar velocity estimators .",
    "+ on large , linear scales , the density and peculiar velocities are related through the continuity equation : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the scale factor and comoving fourier mode , respectively .",
    "the peculiar velocity of a cluster , as probed by its ksz effect , can be interpreted as the linear peculiar velocity field smoothed on comoving scale @xmath11 which corresponds to the cluster s mass @xmath12 via @xmath13^{1/3 } , \\label{eq : rscale}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the background matter density .",
    "the ksz effect is sensitive to the line - of - sight component of the velocity , but under the assumption that the velocity field is gaussian and isotropic ( which should be satisfied in the linear regime ) the three spatial components of the velocity field must be statistically independent . moreover , the power spectrum must completely determine the statistical properties of the velocity field .",
    "thus , in a given cosmological model , the linear velocity field power spectrum ( which in turn is related to the matter power spectrum ) should univocally determine the angular correlation function ( and angular power spectrum ) of the line - of - sight cluster velocities .",
    "+ in linear theory , the velocity dispersion smoothed over spheres of comoving radius @xmath11 ( corresponding to a given cluster mass @xmath12 ) is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fourier transform of the top hat window function , @xmath17 is the hubble function , @xmath18 is the linear growth factor and @xmath19 is the present day linear matter power spectrum , ( the power spectra at any redshift will be denoted as @xmath20 ) .",
    "hence the power spectrum of the velocities is : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the velocity growth factor .",
    "when computing @xmath23 for different dark energy models , we used the analytical fit provided by @xcite : @xmath24 } , \\label{eq : gfwrel}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 gives the deviation of the growth factor from that of a critical ( @xmath26 ) universe , and @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 , \\label{eq : gammaexp}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 if @xmath30 and @xmath31 otherwise .",
    "+ the growth of the velocity perturbations with redshift may provide useful cosmological constraints such as constraints on the equation of state of dark energy @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.([fig : dv ] ) , where we show the redshift evolution of the velocity growth factor for three different cosmological models : a @xmath32cdm model ( @xmath4 , @xmath33 , thick solid line ) , a flat universe with @xmath3 and dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath34 ( dotted line ) , and another flat model with @xmath3 and @xmath35 , ( dashed line ) .",
    "due to the @xmath36 factor in the denominator of eq.([eq : psv ] ) , the signal is weighted by the largest scales , making this probe relatively insensitive to the smoothing scale and therefore to clusters mass .",
    "indeed , if the dependence of @xmath37 versus mass is approximated by a power law , then one finds that for the concordance model @xmath38 .",
    "+ having this in mind , we compute here the angular correlation function of the _ line - of - sight _",
    "( los ) cluster velocities .",
    "note that @xcite takes a different approach to this calculation . assuming that we can measure the los component of the peculiar velocity of a cluster , we compute the quantity @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote two different directions in the sky , `` connecting '' the observer to the cluster positions @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes the angle between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix b for the detailed derivation and here we report the final expression for this correlation function : @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 )              \\ ; j_l ( k x_2 \\sin{\\theta_{12 } } ) , \\label{eq : corv2_tex}\\ ] ] in this equation , the factor @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the ( comoving ) distances to the clusters , ( without loss of generality we have used the convention that @xmath51 ) . here",
    "@xmath52 denote the spherical bessel functions and the summation must take place only over _ even _ values of @xmath53 ; @xmath54 and @xmath55 refer to the linear scales corresponding to the masses of each cluster . note that we recover eq.([eq : vel1 ] ) in the limit of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "+    fig.([fig : cvv1]a ) shows the behaviour of @xmath58 vs @xmath59 in the concordance @xmath32cdm model for a couple of @xmath60 m@xmath61 clusters when they are both placed at z=0.005 ( solid line ) , both placed at z=0.1 both ( dashed line ) and when once cluster is at z=0.1 and the other at z=1 ( dotted line ) . in the first ( clearly unrealistic ) case , the clusters are so close to us that both are comoving in the same bulk flow with respect to the cmb frame , giving rise to the dipolar pattern shown by the solid line . in the case",
    "where both clusters are at @xmath62 ( dashed line ) , their correlation properties are strongly dependent on @xmath59 , since this angle defines the distance between the clusters . for small angular separation ,",
    "the clusters are still relatively nearby , and hence their peculiar velocities are correlated , but this correlation dies as the separation of the clusters increases .",
    "the angular distance at which the correlation drops to half its value at zero separation is @xmath63 10 , corresponding to roughly 40 @xmath64 mpc . finally ,",
    "if clusters are very far apart from each other ( thick dotted line ) , their peculiar velocities are not correlated .",
    "+ an alternative way to present the correlation properties of the projected peculiar velocities of the clusters is the velocity field angular power spectrum . in appendix b , we invert @xmath65 into its angular power spectrum @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath67 we find that @xmath68 where the @xmath69 coefficients are defined by @xmath70 fig.([fig : cvv1])b displays the power spectra for two cases : two very nearby clusters ( both at z=0.005 , solid line ) , showing an almost dipolar pattern , and two relatively far away clusters ( both at z=0.1 , dashed line ) , case in which the power is transferred to higher multipoles .",
    "the power spectrum for the clusters placed at z=0.005 and z=0.1 is zero .",
    "+ here we have characterised the projected peculiar velocity field at cluster scales .",
    "next , we address the study of the ksz effect and its comparison with the tsz effect .",
    "the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect describes the doppler kick that cmb photons experience when they encounter a moving cloud of electrons .",
    "since this is simple thomson scattering , there is no change of the photon frequency , and hence it leaves no spectral signatures in the cmb blackbody spectrum .",
    "therefore , this effect is solely determined by the number density of free electrons and their relative velocity to the cmb frame .",
    "an observer will only be sensitive to the _ radial _ component of the electron peculiar velocity , so the expression for the change in brightness temperature becomes ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1968 ) @xmath71    here , we have assumed that the peculiar velocity is the same for all electrons .",
    "@xmath72 stands for the optical depth , and @xmath73 is a unitary vector giving the direction of observation",
    ". this process must take place in two contexts : ( 1 ) when the intergalactic medium becomes ionized by the high energy photons emitted by the first stars , inhomogeneities in the electron velocity and density distributions generate a ksz signal which is known as the ostriker - vishniac effect . despite of the large size of ionized structures encountered by the cmb photons ,",
    "the electron density contrast is relatively small , and further , we do not know where in cmb maps to look for this signal because we do not know the location of the ionized bubbles which formed during reionization .",
    "the amplitudes and angular scales at which this effect should be visible are model dependent , but can be as high as a few microk in the multipole range @xmath74 , @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) clusters of galaxies at lower redshift leave a more easily detectable signal .",
    "their high electron density can give rise to values of @xmath72 as high as @xmath75 , and their peculiar velocities should be close to 300 kms@xmath76 at @xmath77 , which together can produce temperature fluctuations of the order of 1 - 10 @xmath78k .",
    "the clusters high optical depth is also responsible for large spectral distortions of the cmb generated through the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( tsz ) effect .",
    "the tsz effect is typically an order of magnitude larger than the ksz and introduces _ frequency dependent _ brightness temperature fluctuations which , in the not relativistic limit , change sign at 218 ghz .",
    "therefore by combining observations in bands at frequencies lower and higher than this cross frequency , it is possible to obtain the cluster position and to characterize the tsz cluster signal .",
    "once the cluster position is identified their ksz contribution should be accessible at @xmath79218 ghz . however ,",
    "as noted by @xcite and earlier by @xcite , even with measurements in three different frequencies it may not be possible to obtain a clean estimate of the ksz effect for a single cluster .",
    "we shall show below that we are not interested in a very accurate ksz estimate for a given cluster , but on _ unbiased _ estimates on our entire cluster sample .",
    "+ in the next subsection we make a detailed comparison of the amplitude of the ksz and the tsz effects .      in what follows",
    "we shall describe the galaxy cluster population by adopting the model presented in @xcite .",
    "this model is based upon the spherical collapse description of galaxy clusters @xcite , and assumes that clusters are isothermal and their gas acquires the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "the halo mass and redshift distribution is approximated by the formalism presented in @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details in this modelling . + both ksz and tsz effects can be written as integrals of some function @xmath80 along the line of sight crossing the cluster , weighted by the electron density : @xmath81 for the non - relativistic tsz @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the adimensional frequency in terms of the cmb monopole @xmath84 , @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 are the electron density , temperature and mass respectively , @xmath89 the thomson cross - section and @xmath90 the boltzmann constant . for the ksz , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a unitary vector pointing along the line of sight , and",
    "@xmath94 is the cluster peculiar velocity .",
    "if clusters are perfectly virialised objects , then one must expect the scaling @xmath95 .",
    "however , following @xcite , the cluster model should leave some room for some deviations from such scaling , which can be due to internal ( non - linear ) cluster physics , deviations from purely gravitational equilibrium , preheating , etc .",
    "our parametrization adopts @xmath96 , where @xmath97 for a perfectly virialized cluster , but spans the range from 1.5 to 2 in the literature .",
    "we shall present results for @xmath97 , but the sensitivity of our results on @xmath98 is minimal . at the same time , the radial peculiar velocity dispersion of the clusters , @xmath99 decreases very slowly with mass ( @xmath100 ) , so , at fixed redshift we must expect the ratio ksz / tsz to be bigger for low mass clusters , which are more numerous . regarding the redshift dependence , clusters tend to be denser at earlier epochs ( the product @xmath101 scales roughly as @xmath102 ) , so we must expect larger tsz and ksz amplitudes at higher redshifts .",
    "however , the dependence of the function @xmath103 is different in each case : while clusters are hotter at earlier times ( @xmath104 ) , velocities have not had so much time to grow as at present epochs ( @xmath105 ) , and hence the ratio ksz / tsz ( @xmath106 ) decreases with redshift .",
    "+ we show these scalings explicitely in fig.([fig : tsz_ksz ] ) , where the thin lines evaluate the tsz and the ksz at @xmath77 and thick lines correspond to @xmath107 .",
    "the solid lines provide the amplitude of the cluster - induced tsz fluctuations at 222 ghz , which , as we shall see below , will be taken as our effective frequency after accounting for the tsz relativistic corrections and the effects related to the finite spectral width of the detectors .",
    "the dashed lines provide the expected rms amplitude of the ksz effect in clusters : we see that , at @xmath77 , clusters of masses below @xmath108 @xmath109 should produce more ksz than tsz flux at 222 ghz , at least by a factor of a few .",
    "this mass threshold decreases at @xmath107 , but so does the typical halo mass at such redshift ( clusters of @xmath110 are very rare objects ) , so again we must expect the ksz to dominate over the tsz .",
    "we next study the ksz signal generated by the entire population of clusters of galaxies by computing its two second - order momenta , i.e. , the correlation function and the power spectrum . for this , it is first necessary to have a model to describe the population of galaxy clusters in the universe .",
    "we shall adopt the hierarchical scenario in which small scale overdensities in the universe become non - linear and collapse first , and then merge and give rise to bigger non - linear structures .",
    "the abundance of haloes of a given mass at a given cosmic epoch or redshift is given by the clusters mass function .",
    "we will adopt the sheth & tormen ( hereafter st ) mass function @xcite , which will be denoted by @xmath111 and provides the _ average _ number density of haloes of mass contained between @xmath12 and @xmath112 at redshift @xmath113 .",
    "it must not be confused with @xmath114 , which is the _ actual _ number of haloes in that mass range at position @xmath115 .",
    "the latter can be understood as a _ random _ variable , the former as its _ mean_. as it will be useful later , we first compute the mean number of haloes present in two volume elements centered at @xmath42 and @xmath43 : @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118 \\delta [ n(m_2 , { \\mbox{\\bf { x}}}_2 ) ] \\rangle .",

    "the first term in the right hand side of the equation is merely a constant , but will have its relevance , because it will couple with the velocity field as we shall see below .",
    "the next term containing the dirac deltas accounts for the ( assumed ) poissonian statistics ruling the ( discrete ) number density of sources , and will be referred to as the _ poissonian _ term . in the third term , @xmath121 $ ] stands for the deviation with respect to the average halo number density due to the environment , i.e. , due to large scale overdensities , which condition the halo clustering .",
    "therefore , this third term describes the spatial clustering of haloes , which is a biased tracer of the spatial clustering of matter . in the extended press - schecter approach",
    "it can be shown that the power spectrum and the correlation function of haloes and underlying matter are merely proportional to each other over a wide range of scales .",
    "this is commonly expressed by a _ bias factor _ @xcite , so that @xmath122    here @xmath123 and @xmath124 stand for halo - halo and matter correlation function / power spectrum , respectively",

    "members of the cluster pairs must be within @xmath172 .",

    "the thick dashed line shows the correlation function for clusters located at @xmath176 . as the redshift increases ( @xmath177 medium thickness dashed line ; @xmath178 , thin dashed line ) , the amplitude at zero lag increases ( clusters are more concentrated ) and the correlation angle decreases .",

    "@xcite pointed out a potentially important non - linear aspect that is not included in our modeling : in very massive superclusters , the ksz effect shows typically a dipolar pattern , plausably caused by the encounter of two oppossite bulk flows at their common attractor s position . since our model predicts no dipolar pattern at scales of a few degrees , such scenario is not accounted for by our approach .",
    "hence , in a realistic application the core of such overdense regions should be excised from the analyses .",
    "such massive structures however are very rare and form at very late epochs , and their exclusion should not compromise the analysis presented here .",

    "may be sub - optimal but our aim is to quantify the relative importance of difference sources of error and to roughly forecast the expected signal to noise for those experiments .",
    "we defer the developement of an optimal procedure to future work .",
    "we shall try to extract the ksz signal in a statistical sense : while previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ) have addressed the difficulty of separating the ksz effect from potential contaminants ( tsz , radio - source emission , infrared galaxies , cmb , etc ) in a given cluster , our approach will consist on combining the signal coming from subsets of clusters in such a way that the contribution of the noise sources averages out .",
    "as we shall see , the success of this procedure will rely on the precision to which the _ average _ properties of the potential contaminants are known .",
    "+ the first approach , which we shall refer to as method ( a ) , is based on measurements of the ksz flux and its redshift evolution .",

    "we will concentrate on the 220 ghz channel , although some knowledge will be assumed to be inferred from the other bands .",
    "for instance , the 250 ghz channel will be very useful to estimate the level of infrared - galaxy emission at lower frequencies .",
    "likewise , the 145 ghz channel should be critical when characterizing the tsz flux from each cluster . for simplicity",
    ", we will concentrate on the variance of the ksz signal , but it is easy to estimate the ksz angular correlation function introduced in subsection 4.4 . + the strip covered by act should also be surveyed by salt .",

    "hence , a direct comparison can be made with tsz detected cluster sample .",
    "salt spectroscopic follow up will enable to obtain the cluster redshifts .",
    "the method is as follows :    * for every detected galaxy cluster , we take a patch of radius equal to one projected cluster virial radius .",
    "we can use the edge of significant tsz emission at other frequencies to define this radius .",
    "we compute the mean temperature within this patch , and draw a ring surrounding it , of width , say , 10% of the virial radius .",

    "this operation should remove most of the cmb contribution to the average temperature in the patch , but will unavoidably leave some residuals , which will be denoted here as @xmath181 .",
    "these residuals will have two different contributions : the first coming from the inaccurate cmb subtraction , the second one being due to instrumental noise residuals , @xmath182 @xmath183 is the number of beam sizes present in the ring , and @xmath184 is the instrumental noise variance .",
    "if we denote the patch of radius the cluster virial radius as _ region 1 _ , and by _ region 2 _ the ring surrounding it , it can be easily proved that the first term in the rhs of the last equation reads @xmath185 @xmath186 @xmath187 @xmath188 and @xmath189 denote the solid angles of the patch and the ring , respectively , whereas @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote directions in the sky and @xmath190 is the cmb angular correlation function evaluated at the angle separating the directions @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
