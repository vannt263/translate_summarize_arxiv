    "al @xcite ( fpu ) were first who began to study numerically statistical properties of nonlinear 1d atomic chains .",
    "the reason for the failure of their attempt to get the redistribution of the energy of one mode between others due to nonlinearity now is clear @xcite .",
    "kolmogorov @xcite , arnold @xcite and moser @xcite ( kam theorem ) have proofed that in the case of small nonintegrable addition term to integrable hamiltonian the system under some conditions can hold quasiperiodic motion on an invariant torus .",
    "izrailev and chirikov @xcite supposed that there is the border of stochasticity for nonlinear chains .",
    "they used the resonance overlap criterion and obtained analytical condition of the onset of chaos .",
    "further numerical calculations of nonlinear hamiltonian chains @xcite confirmed these results .",
    "now the study of the chains which are in the contact with thermostat is of most interest .",
    "dynamical properties of such systems are more complicated . they are not hamiltonian ones and describe the open systems which can exchange energy with environment .",
    "the systems under uniform temperatures are of marginal interest .",
    "but the systems with nonuniform temperature are much more interesting because they provide the thermal transport from higher temperature to lower .",
    "such systems are investigated intensively .",
    "the different dynamical properties of different 1d chains result in various heat transport laws .",
    "the heat transfer in macroscopic solids obeys the fourier heat conduction law @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the heat flux , @xmath3 is the thermal conductivity , which does nt depend on a sample size , and @xmath4 is the temperature gradient .    now",
    "the validity of the fourier law is justified by means of numerical calculations in the ding - a - ling @xcite and the frenkel and kontorova @xcite models .",
    "the integrable systems , such as harmonic @xcite and toda @xcite chains , do nt form the temperature gradient because there is no scattering of the thermal excitations which transport the heat .",
    "the thermal conductivity of these systems is divergent .",
    "the fpu chains @xcite , the diatomic toda lattice @xcite , the heisenberg spin chain @xcite take intermediate states .",
    "the thermal conductivity of the models diverges as @xmath5 at the number of particles @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "in this paper we do not consider the thermal conductivity of chains with the large numbers of particles .",
    "we set sparer task which is to examine the dynamical behavior of short chains of the fpu type , which are in the contact with thermostates , and to compare them with that of similar hamiltonian chains under suitable conditions .",
    "the dynamical properties of the systems with great number of the degrees of freedom are hard to investigate numerically . to avoid the problem we consider the atomic chains with small numbers of particles and assume that their characteristic properties can be extended to the chains with greater dimension .    as a model we used the 1d chain of @xmath8 classical particles with mass @xmath9 positioned in the points @xmath10 and interacting with each other via a nonharmonic potential @xmath11 . in the equilibrium state the particles",
    "are located at equal distances @xmath12 from each other .",

    "indexes @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to the motionless points with coordinates @xmath17 and @xmath18 which are the boundary conditions for eq.([e2.1 ] ) .",
    "potential used in the model is the sum of the harmonic and the quartic terms @xmath19 where @xmath3 is the elasticity factor and @xmath20 is the nonlinearity parameter .",
    "hereinafter the model parameters used are @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the system of the ordinary differential equations eq.([e2.1 ] ) was solved numerically by means of the modification @xcite of the verlet algorithm @xcite .",
    "the randomly chosen particle velocities at the equilibrium particle positions were used as the initial conditions . the kinetic energy per particle , which we call `` temperature '' ,",
    "is used as driving parameter which controls the type of dynamics .",
    "now it is known that a nonlinear hamiltonian particle chain with @xmath23 can demonstrate a quasiperiodic or a chaotic type of motion . to identify the character of the chain motion we analyzed the time series , which are the sets of velocities of the second particle in a chain taken with the time interval @xmath24 . such an approach",
    "is widely used to investigate the properties of chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "the power spectrums and the autocorrelation functions of the solutions were the criteria of the chain dynamics .",
    "the examples of these functions corresponding to the 4-particle chain which is in a regular and a chaotic dynamical states in the close vicinity of the boundary temperature are shown in figs.[f1 ] and [ f2 ] .",
    "an additional information was obtained by means of the calculation of the correlation dimension @xmath25 which evaluates the lower limit of the hausdorff dimension of the subset of the phase space occupied with the solutions . in the case of a quasiperiodic motion @xmath25",
    "gives the dimension of the corresponding invariant torus . in all cases examined @xmath26 for the regular dynamics . in the chaos regime the correlation dimension seemingly strongly depends on initial conditions and is a random value .",
    "temperature dependence of the correlation dimension of the 4-particle chain solutions is plotted in fig.[f3 ] .",
    "if these characteristics did not make it possible for identification of the type of motion unambiguously , the time behavior of phase trajectories with close initial conditions was analyzed .",

    "results of the calculations are shown in fig.[f4 ] .",
    "the numerically obtained boundary temperatures are marked by open circles .",
    "these points separate the regions of a regular and a chaotic dynamics of the chains .",
    "the dependence obtained was fitted by the function @xmath31 shown by the solid line .",
    "the numerical parameters were found by means of the least square method .",
    "this dependence is in qualitative accordance with the chirikov criterion @xcite which predicts that critical parameter @xmath32 for large @xmath8 and high modes .",
    "there are two short chains ( @xmath33 ) which fall out from the dependence discussed .",
    "two - particle chain under reasonable restriction on temperature ( particle shift @xmath34 ) demonstrates a regular dynamics only . in the case",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36 is considerably larger than that in fig.[f4 ] .",
    "as it follows from the obtained dependence , the boundary temperature @xmath0 decreases rapidly when the chain length @xmath8 grows .",
    "moreover , the total boundary energy of the chains @xmath37 decreases as @xmath38 .",
    "in this section we consider the 1d atomic chains interacting with a thermostat , i.e. with a large system which is under constant temperature and is nt influenced by the chain .",
    "this problem is very different from that considered in the previous section .",
    "the motion of the hamiltonian chains is stipulated unambiguously by the initial conditions and the chain total energy is an integral of motion . in this case",
    "the system dynamical properties can be obtained by means of analyzing the phase trajectories or the time series .    an open system exchanges energy with a thermostat . in this case",
    "the system total energy is fluctuating .",
    "other difference is that the dynamics and fluctuations of the system are driven by the same cause , that is the thermostat temperature . in this case",
    "the contributions of the dynamics and the fluctuations in the motion of the system are the same and we ca nt separate them .    in this section",
    "we consider the chains in which the first and the last particles are in the contact with the thermostats with temperatures @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the thermostat temperatures are the parameters of the problem .",
    "we used both the langeven and the nse - hoover @xcite thermostats .",
    "both of them give the qualitatively same results .",
    "therefore we show the results obtained with the nse - hoover thermostat only .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +    first we considered the chains at the uniform temperature @xmath41 . to understand the chain behavior we analyzed the time series and plotted the autocorrelation functions and the power spectrums of the chains with different @xmath8 and the thermostat temperatures @xmath28 .",
    "the results for @xmath42 and @xmath43 are shown in fig.[f5 ] . as it is seen in fig.[f4 ]",
    "this temperature corresponds to the quasiperiodic motion of the hamiltonian chain .",
    "however , the plots fig.[f5 ] are characteristic rather to noise with short correlation time than to a dynamical motion .",
    "such a picture is typical for the chains with other @xmath8 and at the temperatures regions corresponding to both a quasiperiodic and a chaotic motion .",
    "other approaches used in section [ ii ] also do nt allow to identify a type of motion .",
    "the correlation dimensions are more than the total phase space one @xmath44 at any temperatures what does nt correspond to either dynamical motion .",
    "the behavior of two phase trajectories with close initial conditions at any temperatures is typical to a developed chaos .     +    but the study of the chains with a nonuniform temperature distribution was more informative .",
    "we calculated the temperature distribution along the chains at different temperatures on left and right ends and plotted the temperature gradients as functions of temperature for different chains .",
    "the main difficulty in such an approach is that the temperature gradient at a fixed number of particles strongly depends on both temperatures .",
    "we tried to find the maximum temperature gradient which can be formed in each chain at given left temperature @xmath39 .",
    "the temperature profiles for the chain with @xmath45 at left temperatures in the interval @xmath46 are plotted in fig.[f6 ] . to find the profile we specified the thermostat temperatures on the chain ends and waited during time interval @xmath47 to thermalize the chain",
    ". then we get the local temperature as a particle kinetic energy averaged over the time interval @xmath48 .",
    "temperature gradient as function of temperature @xmath39 for the chains of different length.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +    the temperature gradients as the functions of the temperature of the first particle @xmath39 are shown in fig.[f7 ] for the chains with @xmath49 .",
    "they were found by the least square method using @xmath50 points of the chains with the exception of the last one .",
    "the markers show the points calculated .",
    "the solid lines fit the dependencies obtained using the expression @xmath51 the fitting parameters are shown in the table .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is the temperature at which the temperature gradient becomes zero . at lower temperatures @xmath52 the temperature gradient is equal to zero .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the heat flux is finite at any temperature @xmath39 if @xmath53 is finite .",
    "therefore the thermal conductivity diverges as soon as @xmath54 and it is divergent at @xmath52 .",
    "this means that the interaction of the thermal excitations transferring the heat , which is responsible for the conductivity , disappears at this temperature .",
    "the thermal conductivity is plotted as the function of the temperature @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] .",
    "the temperatures @xmath0 of the thermostated chains are shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] by the close circles .",
    "they lie in the close vicinity of the positions corresponding to the boundary temperatures @xmath0 of the hamiltonian chains with the same number of particles .",
    "these temperatures separate the regions of stochastic and the regular motion of the chains under thermal fluctuations .",
    "so , we can see analogy between the dynamics of the hamiltonian and the thermostated chains .",
    "temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity for the chains of different length.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +",
    "we considered the dynamics of short hamiltonian chains and chains interacting with the thermostats .",
    "it is shown that both types of the chains demonstrate similar dynamical behavior .",
    "in particular , the hamiltonian chains depending on temperature can be in two dynamical states , regular ( quasiperiodic ) and stochastic ( chaotic ) , which are separated by the boundary temperature @xmath0 ( fig.[f4 ] ) .",
    "the results were obtained by means of analyzing of time series .",
    "this approach does nt work in the case of the thermostated chains because of strong thermal fluctuations . in this case",
    "we used the indirect method to ascertain dynamics of the chains .",
    "we analyzed the temperature dependence of the slope of the temperature profiles of the chains and found the temperature @xmath0 at which the slope vanishes .",
    "at the temperatures @xmath55 the thermal conductivity is divergent as it takes place in integrable systems .",
    "so , we can suppose that in this temperature interval the chain , in spite of the fluctuations , demonstrates the regular ( fluctuated quasiperiodic ) motion .",
    "accordingly , at @xmath56 the chain dynamics is stochastic ( fluctuated chaotic ) .",
    "the method used to analyze the thermostated chains allows us to evaluate the boundary temperatures only .",
    "we can specify a regular or a stochastic chain motion but ca nt obtain its more detailed characteristics , which are responsible for the thermal conductivity behavior .",
    "apparently , for this purpose investigation of the hamiltonian chains is more promising .",
