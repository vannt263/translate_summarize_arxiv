    "the local density of states at the boundary of a superconductor is a crucial factor in many experiments , for example tunneling measurements . for conventional @xmath1-wave superconductors ,",
    "the local density of states at an insulating boundary is practically the same as in the bulk . in particular ,",
    "the specific boundary geometry is irrelevant . in the case of @xmath0-wave symmetry , however , the situation is completely different . due to andreev bound states @xcite , a drastic enhancement of the low - energy density of states can be observed at a straight flat surface appearing as a pronounced zero - bias conductance peak @xcite .",
    "this effect is maximal if the @xmath0-wave nodal direction is perpendicular to the boundary and shrinks when the orientation is changed @xcite . for an angle of 45 degrees between nodal direction and boundary , the andreev bound states disappear completely . besides this well - known effect , it is important to realize that for @xmath0-wave symmetry also the boundary geometry itself can have strong influence on the local density of states . in this work",
    "we examine the local density of states at the surface of a @xmath0-wave superconductor for some basic examples of polygonal boundary geometries and show that andreev bound states are sensitive to the boundary geometry .",
    "we also consider the additional influence of a single abrikosov vortex pinned near the boundary .    in a previous work we have shown , that the presence of an abrikosov vortex in the vicinity of the boundary of a @xmath0-wave superconductor has a drastic effect on the zero - energy andreev bound states .",
    "this effect appears as a surprisingly large shadow - like suppression of the zero - energy density of states between vortex and boundary @xcite .",
    "the suppression is due to the supercurrent flowing around the vortex , which locally shifts the quasiparticle energies and leads to a splitting of the zero - energy peak .",
    "a similar splitting has already been studied for a homogeneous surface current@xcite .",
    "one of the purposes of the present study is to show that this vortex shadow effect is stable and robust even if the boundary of the superconductor possesses some roughness or faceting .",
    "the paper is divided into five sections . in the next section ,",
    "we give a short introduction to the theoretical framework used for the calculations . in the third section",
    ", we present some zero - energy local densities of states for simple wedge - shaped boundary geometries and discuss some elementary effects .",
    "after that , we turn to the aspect of boundary roughness in section four , where we consider more complicated polygonal boundary structures .",
    "finally , we end with our conclusions in section five .",
    "in the limit @xmath2 , the equilibrium properties of a superconductor are contained in the eilenberger propagator @xmath3 .",
    "the propagator itself can be calculated by solving a transport - like equation first introduced by eilenberger @xcite and independently by larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite . here",
    ", we will use the so - called riccati parametrization of the eilenberger theory , which was introduced in ref .   and",
    "has proven to be very useful for the numerical computation of the propagator ( for more details see ref .  ) . in order to obtain a solution for a given fermi vector @xmath4 at the point @xmath5 , the coupled eilenberger equations are parametrized along a trajectory passing through @xmath5 in direction of the fermi velocity corresponding to @xmath4 @xmath6 along this trajectory , the eilenberger equations can be transformed to two decoupled differential equations of the riccati type for the scalar functions @xmath7 and @xmath8:@xcite @xmath9",

    "together with the starting values in the bulk @xmath13 the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be integrated in an easy and numerically stable way along the trajectory .",
    "the eilenberger propagator @xmath16 is related to the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 by @xmath17 assuming a cylindrical fermi surface , @xmath4 depends only on an polar angle @xmath18 @xmath19 and the local density of states , normalized to the normal state density of states at the fermi level @xmath20 , is given by @xmath21_{i \\epsilon_n \\rightarrow e + i \\delta}\\ ] ] practically , this means that the integrand has to be evaluated for many angles @xmath18 , each angle corresponding to one particular trajectory through @xmath5 .",
    "the energy @xmath22 is taken with respect to the fermi level and @xmath23 can be regarded as an effective scattering parameter which is proportional to an inverse mean free path .    in the calculations presented below , the specific boundary geometry of the superconductor has to be taken into account .",
    "since we assume that the transmission coefficient of all the boundaries is zero , the boundary conditions@xcite simplify considerably . in our case , a trajectory which hits the boundary",
    "is simply reflected like a ray of light .",
    "thus , for the calculations in this work , a ray tracing procedure has been used , which allows for multiple specular reflections .",
    "the riccati equations ( [ riccati ] ) then have to be solved on such a multiply reflected trajectory ( see for example the trajectories in fig .  [ alpgamn]b ) ) .",
    "we consider gap functions @xmath24 that can be separated into @xmath25 here , the symmetry function for the @xmath26-wave is @xmath27 . in the following we want to concentrate on the part @xmath28 of the gap function , which covers the spatial dependence .",
    "it can be factorized into modulus and phase @xmath29 where we call the modulus @xmath30 the profile function . in principle , both the profile function and the phase @xmath31 should be calculated selfconsistently via the gap equation .",
    "for simplicity , we have taken the profile function to be constant .",
    "this is a good approximation for low temperatures due to the kramer - pesch effect @xcite . even for higher temperatures ,",
    "the changes in the quasiparticle spectra due to this simplification are rather of a quantitative than a qualitative nature .",
    "compared to the constant model profile function , the relevant differences of a more realistic profile function most often reside in comparatively small intervals along the trajectories .",
    "for the situation studied in the following , this occurs near the boundaries or close to the vortex center . in these regions , the local density of states",
    "is somewhat smeared out or softened , if a more realistic profile function is used .",
    "however , the main features to be presented below remain unaffected , as we have checked for specific situations .    in the absence of a vortex",
    ", the phase @xmath31 of the gap function simply is zero . for the case of a pinned abrikosov vortex in the system considered here , as an excellent approximation ,",
    "the gradient of the phase is parallel to the current @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath31 is given as a solution of the laplace equation @xmath34 with a `` phase source '' of @xmath35 at the vortex position .",
    "in other words , integrating the phase gradient along any closed path around the vortex position must add up to a total of @xmath35 .",
    "additionally , @xmath31 has to fulfill von - neumann boundary conditions @xmath36 since currents are not allowed to cross any of the boundaries .",
    "here , @xmath37 denotes the normal vector of the boundary under consideration .    to solve the laplace equation in two dimensions , we use the method of conformal mapping .",
    "this analytical technique can be found in many mathematical textbooks , and in some specific physical textbooks as well .",
    "nevertheless , in the following we give the main aspects of conformal mapping in short .",
    "first , the original two - dimensional domain , where the solution of the laplace equation is sought , is regarded as a part of the complex plane .",
    "this domain is also referred to as physical domain , and it often includes a nontrivial boundary geometry with specific boundary conditions . the main idea and task is to map this physical domain to a simple `` model '' domain by using analytic functions . because of the latter , the laplace equation itself stays invariant under this mapping .",
    "thus , if the solution of laplace s equation with the correct boundary conditions is known in the model domain , also the original problem is solved .",
    "the solution in the physical domain can then be achieved by simply mapping each point to the model domain with the mapping function and taking the corresponding value of the solution there .    in our case of a wedge - shaped physical domain",
    ", the upper complex half space serves as the model plane and @xmath38 shall denote elements thereof .",
    "then , the function @xmath39 , which is given by the formula @xmath40 is the analytical solution of laplace s equation @xmath41 in all points @xmath42 of the upper half plane with @xmath43 . integrating the phase gradient around the singularity at @xmath44 results in a total phase difference of @xmath35",
    ". thus , @xmath45 can be regarded as the position of the phase vortex .",
    "also , von - neumann boundary conditions are satisfied , since the phase gradient is parallel to the boundary ( the real axis ) .",
    "of course , formula  ( [ mirrormodel ] ) is analogous to the well - known mirror image ansatz in electrostatics , the first factor referring to a vortex at position @xmath46 , the second to a virtual antivortex at the mirrored position @xmath47 .    -wave",
    "superconductor with wedge - shaped boundary geometry .",
    "@xmath48 denotes the opening angle of the wedge . the orientation between @xmath0-wave and wedge is parametrized by the angle @xmath49 , which gives the rotation of the full - gap direction with respect to the bisecting line of the wedge . the origin @xmath50 represents the corner of the wedge .",
    "[ geometry ] ]    since the correct solution of the problem in the model domain is given by ( [ mirrormodel ] ) , the next and also last step is to find an analytical function which maps the physical domain to the upper half plane .",
    "it is well - known that the complex power function is analytic and that @xmath51 maps the upper half plane to a wedge with opening angle @xmath48 . in particular , the positive real axis is mapped onto itself .",
    "thus , for the physical domain being a wedge with opening angle @xmath48 measured from the positive real axis , the sought mapping function is just the inversion @xmath52 however , this mapping function is only valid for @xmath53 . for opening angles @xmath54 one has to be careful about the branch cut discontinuity at the negative real axis .",
    "a possible mapping is then given by @xmath55^\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha } \\label{wmap2}\\ ] ] finally , combining the solution ( [ mirrormodel ] ) in the model plane with the above mapping functions @xmath56 , the phase factor of the gap function for a wedge - shaped boundary is given by @xmath57 on the right hand side , @xmath58 is the position vector @xmath59 in complex notation .",
    "analogous , the position of the vortex can be chosen with the parameter @xmath60 .",
    "the opening angle @xmath48 of the wedge enters via the mapping functions ( [ wmap1 ] ) or ( [ wmap2 ] ) , respectively . in principle , the phase factor of more than one vortex is simply the product of several one - vortex solutions ( [ phasefactor ] ) .",
    "however , in the following we will confine ourselves to the case of only one single vortex .",
    "in this section , we investigate the zero - energy local density of states of @xmath26-wave superconductors with wedge - shaped boundary geometries .",

    "if we concentrate on the specific opening angles @xmath88 with the relations ( [ symmbez1 ] ) and ( [ symmbez2 ] ) , it is possible to derive an analytic expression for the local density of states in the corner .    the oscillations in fig .",

    "the size of each mirror is taken to be about @xmath104 , which is of an atomic lengthscale for high-@xmath105 superconductors .",
    "each mirror is randomly tilted .",
    "we have chosen a gaussian distribution between @xmath106 and @xmath107 for all the tilt angles , with a tilt angle of @xmath74 corresponding to a parallel alignment of mirror and boundary line .",
    "additionally , we made the simplification , that the mirrors do not extent into the superconductor .",
    "their only function is to reflect an incoming trajectory according to the mirror orientation , thus producing a kind of random scattering at the boundary .",
    "there are some further consequences of the simplification made above . on the one hand , the flow field inside the superconductor",
    "is not affected by the boundary roughness and is simply the one of a wedge - shaped boundary geometry with opening angle @xmath76 . on the other hand ,",
    "multiple reflections at the boundary and the corresponding effects presented in the previous section are excluded .",
    "however , it is important to note , that for any boundary orientation , there exist zero - energy bound states in some regions of the boundary line because of the microscopic roughness .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier calculations of the zero - bias conductance peak for a rough surface @xcite .",
    "how is the shadow effect due to a vortex affected by such a microscopically rough surface ?",
    "the zero - energy local density of states for a boundary line with one specific randomly generated mirror arrangement and an adjacent abrikosov vortex is shown in fig .",

    "a ) , the nodal line of the @xmath0-wave is perpendicular to the boundary , which corresponds to a ( 110 ) surface or @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "although the appearance of the andreev bound states along the boundary line changes in a characteristic way because of the microscopic roughness , the suppression of the andreev bound states in a shadow - like region clearly persists . in b ) , the orientation between boundary and @xmath0-wave is changed by @xmath108 degrees .",
    "the suppression of the bound states remains , but it is obviously no more symmetric , neither for the smooth nor the microscopically rough boundary .",
    "since the modulus of the phase gradient around the vortex is symmetric , this asymmetry can not be explained by a doppler - shifted energy spectrum , where only local surface currents are taken into account .",
    "in fact , generally the whole quasiparticle `` history '' along its trajectory is very important and may not be neglected . only in the case of a homogeneous flow field @xcite , for example far away from the vortex , it becomes sufficient to consider solely the local current .      ]",

    "a ) no vortex is present .",
    "b ) a single abrikosov vortex is situated @xmath102 away from the averaged boundary line .",
    "[ polygonal ] ]    we now examine the zero - energy local density of states of a @xmath0-wave superconductor along a macroscopically rough boundary line . as an adequate model ,",
    "we take a superconductor with a polygonal boundary geometry , consisting of piecewise smooth facets , each of a length of the order of @xmath100 . in contrast to the model of a microscopically rough surface presented above , the extension of the polygonal boundary geometry",
    "is taken into account completely . for the more simple wedge - shaped boundary in section iii",
    ", we obtained the phase of the gap function in an analytical way by conformal mapping ( cf .",
    "section ii  b ) . for the more general case of a polygonal boundary ,",
    "it becomes necessary to calculate the schwarz - christoffel mapping @xcite numerically .",
    "we used an implementation by driscoll@xcite to obtain the correct corresponding phase .",
    "this toolbox uses the analytically known solution of the phase distribution for a vortex sitting in the center of a disk and conformally maps this solution onto the vortex close to the polygonal boundary , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cfmapping ] .",
    "for the disk , the lines of constant phase are just radial lines , and the phase gradient corresponds to concentric circles , fulfilling the boundary condition that the phase gradient is parallel to the surface .",
    "the toolbox provides the mapping which maps the center of the disk onto the vortex position and the boundary of the disk onto the polygonal boundary .",
    "the resulting lines of constant phase and phase gradient after this mapping are shown in fig .",
    "[ cfmapping ] , right panel .",
    "this means , that within the approximation ( [ gradandj ] ) , the currents due to a single abrikosov vortex are forced to be parallel to each facet of the polygonal boundary .",
    "furthermore , the polygonal boundary allows for multiple reflections of quasiparticle trajectories .",
    "thus , the effects discussed in section  iii can be found here as well .    in fig .",
    "[ polygonal]a ) and b ) , the zero - energy local density of states of the @xmath0-wave superconductor with polygonal boundary structure is shown .",
    "the main direction of the boundary is oriented in such a way , that facets parallel to it exhibit maximum andreev bound states . if we compare the local density of states shown in fig .",
    "[ polygonal]a ) , where no vortex is present , to the case with abrikosov vortex presented in b ) , many of the effects already discussed above can be found again ( cf .",
    "for example fig .",
    "[ keilvortex ] ) .",
    "the energy spectrum in the corner of a right - angled wedge is , independent of its orientation , the @xmath0-wave bulk spectrum .",
    "thus , the nearly right - angled parts of the boundary exhibit a very low zero - energy density of states , which is hardly affected by the presence of the vortex . the main effect of the vortex is again a strong suppression of zero - energy bound states in its shadow region",
    "this is because the zero - energy spectral weight is effectively shifted towards higher energies .",
    "bound states at the boundary , which are further away , are reduced more moderately .",
    "in this work , we investigated the influence of both the boundary geometry and a single pinned abrikosov vortex on the zero - energy local density of states along the boundary of a @xmath26-wave superconductor .",
    "we found that a wedge - shaped boundary can induce a quasiparticle spectrum in the corner of the wedge , which is completely different to that farther away from the corner .",
    "the main mechanism for this effect is the multiple reflection of quasiparticle trajectories . in the corner , this can effectively be described as a mixing of bulk trajectories belonging to different angles .",
    "depending on the opening angle of the wedge and the orientation between @xmath0-wave and boundary geometry , this mixing can either lead to bulk spectra in the corner ( and thus to an absence of bound states ) or to the presence of induced zero - energy bound states . in fig .",
    "[ alpgamn]a ) , we have provided a map , showing for which combinations of opening angle and @xmath0-wave orientation bound states appear .",
    "if the wedge is oriented in such a way , that the nodal direction of the @xmath0-wave is parallel to the bisecting line , the zero - energy density of states in the corner strongly oscillates as a function of the opening angle of the wedge .",
    "although all results presented here have been obtained using a model gap function , a fully selfconsistent calculation is not going to change the results qualitatively .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations mentioned above , for example , should be somewhat reduced , especially for smaller opening angles .",
    "but in any case , it should be possible to observe the oscillations at least for larger opening angles .",
    "another example of an induced quasiparticle spectrum is a wedge with opening angle @xmath75 : the local density of states in the corner of a right - angled wedge is always given by a @xmath0-wave bulk spectrum , even if the orientation allows the highest andreev bound states at both boundary lines .",
    "in addition to this geometrically induced prohibition of bound states , we presented the influence of a single pinned abrikosov vortex on the zero - energy local density of states at the boundary .",
    "bound states at the boundary are locally suppressed , in particular in a shadow - like region close to the vortex . however",
    ", this kind of suppression is due to a splitting of the high zero - energy peak of the bound states . thus it is of a different physical origin .",
    "the spectral weight is effectively shifted towards higher energies , because the quasiparticles `` see '' a locally varying energy shift along their trajectory , which stems from the locally varying flow field around the vortex .",
    "both effects can be observed independently in our results .",
    "we have studied the influence of two types of surface roughness on the vortex shadow effect : microscopic , random scattering at the surface as well as a more macroscopic faceting of the boundary . in the second case we have taken care to calculate the flow field with the appropriate boundary conditions using the conformal mapping technique . in both cases",
    "the vortex shadow effect clearly persists .",
