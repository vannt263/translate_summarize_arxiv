    "this is a brief summary of a number of recent advances in our understanding of bound - state quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) effects .",
    "the topics are ( i ) two - loop corrections to the bound - electron @xmath0 factor , ( ii ) higher - order two - loop corrections to the self - energy of a bound electron , and ( iii ) the laser - dressed lamb shift .",
    "the first two of these rather diverse topics are related to two - loop effects .",
    "the investigation of these is simplified considerably by the use of effective field - theory techniques inspired by nonrelativistic qed ( nrqed )  @xcite .",
    "the wilson coefficients multiplying the effective operators in the nrqed lagrangian are matched against those of the full relativistic theory , providing a simplified framework for the calculation of bound - state effects .",
    "scale - separation parameters such as the photon mass @xmath1 are cancelled at the end of the calculation .",
    "the analysis of higher - order corrections to the @xmath0 factor of the bound electron is simplified further by a transformation to the length gauge , which results in a lesser number of terms to be considered than would be necessary in the velocity gauge .",
    "this fact has inspired the development of long - wavelength qed ( lwqed )  @xcite , a theory which is obtained after power  zienau and foldy  wouthuysen transformations of the first - quantized lagrangian ; the second quantization is carried out by formulating the path integral . consequently , an improved understanding and a tremendous simplification results for the calculation of a number of qed corrections for bound states , such as the @xmath0 factor and higher - order corrections to the self - energy .",
    "a further field of recent studies has been concerned with the interaction of a laser - dressed bound electron with the radiation field  @xcite .",
    "this process entails corrections which can only be understood if the analysis is carried out right from the start in the framework of the laser - dressed states , which are the eigenstates of the quantized atom - laser hamiltonian in the rotating - wave approximation  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the results of a recent investigation  @xcite of the bound - electron @xmath0 factor , which is based on nrqed .",
    "the central result of this investigation is the following semianalytic expansion in powers of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the bound - electron @xmath0 factor ( @xmath4 state ) in the non - recoil limit , which is the limit of an infinite nuclear mass : @xmath5 &    + \\underbrace{{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}}\\ ,   \\left\\ { { 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}}\\ , { \\bigg ( } 1 + \\frac{(z\\alpha)^2}{6 n^2 } { \\bigg ) } + \\frac{(z\\alpha)^4}{n^3 } { \\bigg\\ { } a_{41}\\ , { \\ln}[(z\\alpha)^{-2 } ]   +   a_{40 } { \\bigg\\ } } + { \\cal o}(z\\alpha)^5 \\right\\}}_{\\mbox{one - loop correction } } \\nonumber\\\\[4ex ] &   + \\underbrace { { \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}\\right)^2}\\ ,    \\left\\ { { -0.656958 } \\ ,   { \\bigg ( } 1 +   \\frac{(z\\alpha)^2}{6 n^2 } { \\bigg ) }   +   \\frac{(z\\alpha)^4}{n^3 } { \\bigg\\ { } b_{41}\\ , { \\ln}[(z\\alpha)^{-2 } ] +   b_{40 } { \\bigg\\ } } + { \\cal o}(z\\alpha)^5 \\right\\}}_{\\mbox{two - loop correction } } \\nonumber\\\\[4ex ] & + { \\cal o}(\\alpha^3)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expansion is valid through the order of two loops ( terms of order @xmath6 are neglected ) .",

    "one may therefore ask why these binding corrections are of any phenomenological significance .",
    "the reason is that at somewhat higher @xmath42 , the situation changes drastically , due to @xmath43 scaling of the binding corrections .",
    "in addition , due to numerically large coefficients and logarithmic factors , the `` hierarchy '' of the corrections changes drastically .",
    "roughly , one may say that at @xmath39 , the bound - electron anomalous magnetic moment is approximately independent of binding corrections of order @xmath37 and higher , whereas for higher @xmath42 , the situation is reversed , and the binding corrections to the one- and two - loop contributions are numerically much more significant than the higher - loop free - electron corrections .",

    "the conclusion is that a further improvement of the experiment could lead to a much better determination of the electron mass ; the new theory provides room for at least an improved determination by one order of magnitude .    for the calculation of yet higher - order binding corrections to the one - loop and two - loop contributions ,",

    "in the recent past , seminal advances have been obtained both in the techniques of high - precision spectroscopy ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and in the coherent preparation and manipulation of media by external electromagnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "thus it is desirable to study the bound electrons interacting simultaneously both with the quantized radiation field and with an external driving field .",
    "an accurate theory of such systems , including all dynamic effects , might eventually open a possibility for a whole new class of high - precision experiments , provided that technical problems related to the required highly accurate intensity stabilization of the laser ( and others ) can be solved .",
    "traditionally , radiative and relativistic corrections are treated with methods of qed , whereas studies related to the dynamical nature of the interaction of matter with driving laser fields are the domain of quantum optics ( qo ) .",
    "obviously , a treatment of bound electrons in the presence of both the radiation field and external driving fields requires a combination of ideas from both subject areas : while , _ a priori _ , the essential - state approximation of qo  @xcite is not sufficient to obtain the accuracy of qed , a perturbative treatment of the interaction of the bound electron with a strong external ( laser ) field as in qed is hopeless because of the large coupling parameter .    in  @xcite , an atom with two relevant energy levels driven by a strong near - resonant monochromatic laser field is studied as the easiest model system for the above problem .",
    "the incoherent part of the resonance fluorescence spectrum emitted by this system in qo is known as the mollow spectrum , where the coupling strength is characterized by the the rabi frequency @xmath82 defined as ( @xmath83 ) @xmath84 for a driving laser field @xmath85 with frequency @xmath86 , macroscopic classical amplitude @xmath87 and polarization @xmath88 .",
    "here , @xmath89 is the elementary charge .",
    "the corresponding coupling constant @xmath90 for the interaction of a quantized driving laser field with the main atomic transition is defined by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the electric laser field per photon and @xmath93 is the quantization volume .",
    "the matching of the electric field per photon with the corresponding classical macroscopic electric field @xmath87 is then given by @xmath94 if @xmath82 is larger than the natural decay width @xmath95 of the transition , then the mollow spectrum approximately consists of one central and two sideband peaks of lorentzian shape , which are located symmetrically around the driving laser field frequency .",
    "the sideband peaks are shifted from the driving field frequency by the generalized rabi frequency @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the detuning of the laser field frequency @xmath98 with regard to the atomic transition frequency @xmath99 .",
    "the shape of the mollow spectrum may easily be explained in terms of the dressed states , which are defined as the eigenstates of the quantum optical interaction picture hamiltonian describing the matter - light interaction . in transferring to the dressed state picture ,",
    "the interaction with the driving laser field is accounted for to all orders .",
    "thus , when evaluating radiative and relativistic corrections to the mollow spectrum , it is natural to start the analysis from the dressed - state basis as opposed to the unperturbed atomic bare - state basis . in  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that this distinction in fact has to be made .",
    "it is not sufficient to modify the energies ( which enter in the formula for the dressed states ) according to the usual bare - state lamb shift in order to obtain the correct result for the corrections to the mollow spectrum .",
    "instead , at nonvanishing detuning and nonvanishing rabi frequency , a treatment starting from the dressed - state basis leads to an additional nontrivial correction term .",

    "the leading relativistic and radiative corrections up to relative orders @xmath18 and @xmath106 , respectively , have been evaluated , as well as all other relevant correction terms up to the specified order of approximation .",
    "it turns out that all corrections may be interpreted as either corrections to the rabi frequency @xmath82 or as corrections to the detuning @xmath107 , such that one can define the fully corrected generalized rabi frequency @xmath108 by @xmath109 here , @xmath110 contains all corrections to the rabi frequency , namely the relativistic and radiative corrections to the transition dipole moment , field - configuration dependent corrections , higher - order corrections to the self - energy , and corrections to the secular approximation .",

    "this allows to address questions related to the physical reality of the dressed states . on the other hand ,",
    "the comparison with experimental results could also be used to interpret the nature of the evaluated radiative corrections in the sense of the summation formulas which lead to the interpretation of the shifts as arising from relativistic and radiative corrections to the detuning and the rabi frequency .",
    "one of the obvious conclusions to be drawn from the recent advances in bound - state quantum electrodynamics is as follows .",
    "a widespread opinion has been invalidated which suggested that two - loop corrections to the bound - electron @xmath0 factor , and two - loop corrections to the lamb shift in higher order might be a severe , if not insurmountable , obstacle against further theoretical progress .",

    "other progress concerns the modifications of radiative corrections in dynamical processed as opposed to @xmath125-matrix energy shifts .",
    "the laser - dressed lamb shift  @xcite is a dynamical correction to the dressed - state  @xcite quasi - energies .",
    "the self - energy , in this case , gives the by far dominant effect . while the bulk of the laser - dressed lamb shift can be understood in terms of a radiative correction to the detuning , which is taken into account in a natural way by evaluating the detuning in terms of the observed ( low - intensity ) resonance frequency of the transition , a few tiny shifts persist which can only be understood if the system is treated in the dressed - state picture right from the start .",
    "the dynamic lamb shift is an effect which depends on two parameters that determine the dynamics of the system : ( i ) the detuning and ( ii ) the rabi frequency .",
    "therefore , the dynamical lamb shift could be mapped out as a function of these parameters in a possible experiment . a rather promising candidate for a possible measurement",
    "would be based on the hydrogen 1s2p@xmath126 transition  @xcite .",
