    "heavy quarkonia production in high energy hadronic interactions is a perfect instrument for rigorous studies of qcd nature . due to the large mass of heavy quark , production of quark - antiquark pair",
    "is ruled by the perturbative qcd , while its hadronization can also be described theoretically due to the nonrelativistic nature of these bound states .",
    "moreover , small width of heavy quarkonia provides clean experimental signature , so there is a big experimental statistics available .",
    "multiple production of heavy quarkonia , like paired production of @xmath3 , attracts additional interest due to the possibility to study parton shower structure in details , since double parton scattering ( dps ) may play a tangible role in these processes @xcite . in this connection ,",
    "paired @xmath3 production was studied theoretically by a number of authors @xcite , and , in general , one can conclude that single parton scattering ( sps ) does not underestimate nor contradict experimental cross sections measured by lhcb @xcite , cms @xcite and d0 @xcite collaborations .",
    "it is worth to mention , however , that for the multiple production involving open charm contradictions of sps predictions with the experimental data are considerable @xcite .    in the situation when we can not certainly discriminate between different channels in paired heavy quarkonia production",
    ", there is a promising possibility to shed light on this problem by considering final states that are forbidden or suppressed in the leading order sps , but can easily be produced in dps .",
    "recently such processes as @xmath4 and @xmath5 were considered in a series of works @xcite , where it was shown that nlo effects and feed - down from @xmath6-wave states ( i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) contribute significantly to the sps picture .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the feed - down from @xmath8 to associated @xmath9 production obtained within sps approach has very similar shapes of the differential distributions to that were observed by the lhcb @xcite except for the azimuthal asymmetry , which is the most distinguishing feature of the dps .    in the charm sector",
    "forbidden within lo sps final state is @xmath0 , since in gluon fusion @xmath10 is forbidden due to @xmath2-parity .",
    "the first non - vanishing contribution at the parton level is thus given by the process with additional radiation of real gluon which is @xmath11 .",
    "such additional emission was first considered for direct @xmath1 production in @xcite , and it was shown that even in this case which is allowed at lo , the @xmath11 corrections are very important . as it will be shown in the rest of the paper , at @xmath12 these corrections are even more significant than the lo .",
    "it will be also shown that by switching between different final states @xmath1 or @xmath0 we thereby switch between different underlying mechanisms of the hard reaction .",
    "finally , it is worth to point out that considering additional radiation of real gluon solves another serious problem of lo sps approach : at the lo the hard reaction @xmath13 has strong back - to - back kinematics , so using standard collinear parton distributions ( pdfs ) it is not possible to describe azimuthal or @xmath14 asymmetries or non - vanishing @xmath14 of a whole pair which are observed experimentally . in the case of @xmath1",
    "this could be overcomed by using unintegrated pdfs in the model of @xmath15-factorization @xcite , while @xmath0 is still forbidden at lo .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss main features of the parton processes @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in section iii",
    "we give theoretical predictions for hadronic cross sections .",
    "brief results are given in the last section .",
    "it is well known that in hadronic interactions at high energies the main contribution at the parton level is given by gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "production of a pair of two heavy quarkonia @xmath18 and @xmath19 at lo is described by the process @xmath20 .",
    "two gluons in white configuration have positive @xmath2-parity , which restricts possible quantum numbers of the final state and e.g. production of @xmath0 is forbidden . for this configuration",
    "it is necessary to go beyond lo and consider partonic reaction with additional emission of a gluon : @xmath21 which is of order @xmath11 .",
    "let us note , that in the case of @xmath1 the full @xmath11 nlo corrections include one loop contributions which are not considered in this paper since they again have only back - to - back kinematics .",
    "following @xcite we shall label @xmath11 contributions due to the real emission as nlo*.     diagram for the lo process ( only for @xmath1 ) , @xmath22 diagrams for the nlo * process ( both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are possible ) .",
    "[ fig_diagrams ] ]    typical feynman diagrams of the partonic reaction at lo and nlo * are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagrams ] . in total",
    "there are 438 feynman diagrams ( which we have generated using ` feynarts ` @xcite ) for the nlo * process assuming that each final quark - antiquark pair is formed in the colour singlet combination . here",
    "we should note , that in the following we use the leading order colour singlet term in the nrqcd velocity expansion @xcite for the description of @xmath3 and @xmath23 hadronization . in the case of @xmath3",
    "this is the leading term of the expansion , while for the @xmath23 the leading colour octet term is suppressed @xcite and only singlet contribution is relevant . within this approximation ,",
    "the quark - antiquark projectors have the following form : @xmath24 where the first one is a projector for @xmath3 and the second one for the @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are momentum and polarization vector of @xmath3 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are momentum , spin polarization vector and relative momentum of quarks of @xmath23 . following this definitions ,",
    "the matrix elements for double charmonia production can be written as ( for the details on the projector operators see @xcite ) : @xmath30 ^ 2 \\mathcal a,\\\\ \\mathcal m(j/\\psi + \\,\\chi_c ) \\quad   & = & \\quad \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4\\pi m_c } } r_s(0 ) \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi m_c } } r_p'(0 ) \\left ( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_\\mu } \\mathcal a(q ) \\right)_{q=0 } \\epsilon^\\mu_l,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is @xmath3 radial wave function at the origin and @xmath32 is derivative of @xmath23 wave function , @xmath33 is angular polarization vector of @xmath23 .",
    "the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be determined from the known widths of @xmath34 and @xmath35 decays : @xmath36 using pdg @xcite values for these widths and @xmath37 we get @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the latter value is too small compared to the value obtained from the fit of the single @xmath23 production in lhc @xcite which is @xmath40 . in the rest of the paper we will use this value for the @xmath41 .",
    "we have calculated all matrix elements analytically using ` redberry ` computer algebra system @xcite , while squaring of the amplitude was performed numerically , using explicit clebsh - gordon coefficients for composing @xmath28 and @xmath33 into a state with particular total spin @xmath42 .",
    "let us now look more closely on the properties of feynman diagrams and first let s focus on @xmath16 process",
    ". in general matrix element with three gluon currents has terms proportional to either symmetric @xmath43 or antisymmetric @xmath44 su(3 ) structure constants .",
    "we have found that in this process all terms proportional to @xmath44 cancel each other , which can be explained by assigning negative charge parity to this structure .",
    "all diagrams of type [ fig_diagrams]b with final state radiation ( fsr ) from @xmath23 line cancel each other giving in total zero since @xmath45 ca nt be formed from two gluons . additionally , all 144 diagrams with initial state radiation ( isr ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig_diagrams]d ) also cancel each other due to the @xmath2-parity ( @xmath2-odd final state ca nt be formed from two gluons ) .",
    "next , it was explicitly checked that all fsr diagrams with gluon emitted from @xmath3 are infrared and collinear stable , while diagrams with gluon emitted from @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_diagrams]c ) have collinear singularity ( there are in total 53 such diagrams ) .",
    "it is well known , that this singularity ca nt be cancelled within perturbative qcd @xcite and one have to account for non perturbative effects of the quarkonia bound state and consider colour octet contributions from the fock space of the @xmath23 meson .",
    "as we have already mentioned , these contributions are negligibly small in the region far from the divergence , so in our further analysis we will simply impose a cut - off @xmath46 it is interesting to note , that in the considered process there is no any tangible differences between production features of @xmath47 mesons with different @xmath42 . in the following",
    "we will not distinguish between different @xmath47 states and only total feed - down from @xmath0 states to the @xmath1 production @xmath48 will be considered .",
    "a completely different picture is observed for the @xmath17 partonic reaction .",
    "first of all , contrary to the previous case , all terms with @xmath43 cancel each other in matrix element , so we can assign positive charge parity to it .",
    "moreover , all diagrams with fsr of type fig .",
    "[ fig_diagrams]b in total are zero and all other diagrams with fsr ( fig .",
    "[ fig_diagrams]c ) are infrared and collinear stable , which is quite expected for @xmath49-wave state . on the other hand , isr diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig_diagrams]d ) are divergent in the collinear limit .",
    "the nature of this divergence is , however , completely different from the case of @xmath0 production : now it can be absorbed into well known dglap equations . in our further estimations",
    "we consider the process in the kinematical region safe from this divergence : @xmath50 finally , one should not forget that in the case of @xmath1 leading order process ( fig .  [ fig_diagrams]a ) also gives a contribution .",
    "( solid ) , @xmath51 ( dashed ) , and @xmath52 ( dot - dashed ) .",
    "the cross sections are evaluated with in the kinematical region @xmath53 .",
    "the cross section of @xmath0 is very small , so in the figure it is multiplied by a factor of @xmath54 . [ fig_parton_level_ecm],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the following work we will use two sets of cut - off parameters : @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "[ fig_parton_level_ecm ] shows the dependence of parton cross section on the total energy of the parton reaction .",
    "as one can see , the shapes for the nlo * @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the same , while lo @xmath57 is completely different .",
    "the reason is that in lo feynman diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig_diagrams]a ) momentum of a virtual gluon is fixed and equal to @xmath59 which leads to the overall cross section decrease as @xmath60 .",
    "in the collinear approximation cross section of the hadronic reaction is written in the form : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is partonic cross section , @xmath63 are gluon momentum fractions , and @xmath64 are pdfs . in our work",
    "we use the same scale equal to @xmath65 both for pdfs and @xmath66 . in order to estimate the error due to the choice of the scale",
    ", we additionally performed calculations at @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "for the pdfs and @xmath69 ct10 parametrization @xcite was used ( we have additionally checked ct14 pdfs @xcite and found that the difference in the results is negligible ) .    below we shall present our results at @xmath70 hadronic energy for the lhcb acceptance , i.e. with the rapidity cut @xmath71 for each @xmath3 meson .",
    "results for other energies and kinematical regions are available at request .",

    "the nlo * cross section is even larger than the lo .",
    "account for real radiation also naturally solves the problem of strong back - to - back correlation in @xmath98 kinematics of the lo , thereby providing non trivial distributions over such kinematical variables as total transverse momentum of quarkonia pair , azimuthal and transverse momentum asymmetries .    in section ii it was shown in detail that the production mechanism at the hard scale of partonic reaction is very different for @xmath1 and @xmath0 processes .",
    "in particular by switching between two these final states , we thereby can switch off or switch on different subsets of the underlying feynman diagrams and test different colour structures of the matrix element .",
    "these interesting features can be explained by the charge parity conservation which leads to a non - trivial cancellation between different sets of feynman diagrams .",
    "additionally , in both processes there are collinear singularities due to the emission of real gluon . however , in the case of @xmath0 this singularity arise in final state and its reason in the complicated structure of the fock space of heavy quarkonia , while in the case of @xmath1 singularity arises in the initial state and can be absorbed by a well known altarelli - parisi equations .",
