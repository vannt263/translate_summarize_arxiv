    "<S> we show by a statistical analysis of high - resolution scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments , that the interpretation of the density of electron charge as a statistical quantity leads to a conflict with the heisenberg uncertainty principle . given the precision in these experiments we find that the uncertainty principle would be violated by close to two orders of magnitude , if this interpretation were correct . we are thus forced to conclude that the density of electron charge is a physically real , i.e. in principle precisely measurable quantity .    </S>",
    "<S> keywords : scanning tunneling microscope , electron charge , density functional theory , uncertainty relations    today , stms have reached a level of precision which is quite astonishing . while it was barely possible to resolve the positions of single atoms in early experiments @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> it is now routine not only to resolve the atomic positions but also e.g. the standing wave pattern of surface state electrons @xcite on metal surfaces , and even very subtle effects like inelastic excitations , kondo resonances , or surface charging @xcite . what the stm measures , in these experiments , is the current between a surface and a very sharp probe tip .    </S>",
    "<S> the current itself is proportional to the density of electron charge at the surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while one may dispute this claim for some special cases , and while it can be shown for specific situations that an explicit simulation of the scattering process does improve the agreement between experiment and theory ( see , for example @xcite ) , in measurements on metal surfaces the bias range is so low and the dominance of single electron - states at the tip so high , that the tersoff - hamann approximation @xcite , which assumes tunneling into a single tip - state with radial symmetry , is a very good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> then the map of tunneling currents at a surface is , but for a constant , equal to the map of electron charge densities at the same surface . </S>",
    "<S> a standard deviation of the density of charge due to the uncertainty of position and momentum can thus be mapped identically onto a standard deviation of the tunneling current , which can immediately be compared to experimental results .    from the viewpoint of a physicist of the golden age of quantum mechanics , </S>",
    "<S> say the time around 1925 , the precision of stm measurements , where the vertical resolution of the best instruments is close to fifty times smaller ( about 0.05 pm @xcite ) than the compton wavelength of an electron ( or about 2.4 pm ) , must seem like magic . in figure 1 we show a quantum corral of 51 silver atoms on an ag(111 ) surface measured by rieder et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in some images </S>",
    "<S> the instrument was able to resolve not only the standing wave pattern of surface state electrons , but also the modulation due to the positions of single surface atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement is quite spectacular , and it raises some very fundamental problems in quantum mechanics , which we shall explore in the following . </S>",
    "<S> it is irrelevant for this analysis , whether the remaining experimental imprecision is due to microscopic or macroscopic processes : it is the level of precision in these experiments itself , which is problematic .    in density </S>",
    "<S> functional theory ( dft ) a many - electron system is comprehensively described by the density of electron charge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the density itself , within the framework of second quantization , is thought to be a statistical quantity @xcite . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , this statement can be tested by a statistical analysis of high - resolution stm measurements including the uncertainty relations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason that such an analysis at this point is necessary is the following :    in a recent paper @xcite it was found that an extended model of electrons fully recovers the formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of schrdinger s equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a very fundamental issue in quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> originally , it was found by born , jordan and schrdinger that the formulation of the theory in terms of the schrdinger equation is equivalent to the formulation in terms of operators and matrices , as proposed by heisenberg @xcite , implying the uncertainty relations . however , this equivalence depends on the interpretation of the electron as a point - particle . </S>",
    "<S> it is not a priori valid for an extended electron . for extended electrons </S>",
    "<S> the density of charge will be a physical property of a microsystem . </S>",
    "<S> the question then arises , whether the uncertainty relations are still meaningful in this context . </S>",
    "<S> this question can in principle be answered by an analysis of measurements of electron charge distributions . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the interpretation of the electron wave as a physical wave makes the usual , purely mathematical , derivation of the uncertainty relations via fourier transforms and a gaussian wave packet untenable . if the electron is a real wave , then it does possess a physical momentum and it is essentially a plane wave confined to some region in space . in this case </S>",
    "<S> a composition of single electrons in terms of a fourier series of partial waves with different momenta , even though mathematically possible , is physically not meaningful . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty relations are thus a statement about the physical properties of systems at the atomic scale @xcite . if it turns out that even in our most precise measurements the interpretation of the density of electron charge as a statistical quantity is still possible , then the uncertainty relations have a meaning also in this context . however , if it turns out that standard statistical quantities , depending on the uncertainty of location and momentum , will be much smaller in the actual experiments than allowed for by a theoretical analysis , then the uncertainty relations , and by implication operator mechanics , can not be considered an equivalent description . in this case , it should also be ultimately possible to measure any physical property of a microsystem , i.e. an atomic - scale system , with in principle infinite precision .    </S>",
    "<S> the statistical measure we shall use for our analysis is the standard deviation @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the standard deviation for a measurement of position @xmath1 , given @xmath2 measured values @xmath3 , is defined as : @xmath4    where @xmath5 denotes the statistical average . </S>",
    "<S> we shall analyze the variation of the density of electron charge at a metal surface , and compare the local contrast in the experiments , which is given by the change of the density from one point of measurement to the next , with the achievable contrast on the basis of allowed energy , momentum , and position uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> we shall explicitly treat noble metal ( 111 ) surfaces , where free electrons , confined to the surface layer , exist , which can be treated for all practical purposes as free electrons . </S>",
    "<S> they should thus comply with the following fundamental relation in quantum mechanics : @xmath6 the relation between an uncertainty in momentum and an uncertainty in energy is described by : @xmath7    it is difficult to define the exact uncertainty of momentum of a surface state electron in the experiments . from the energy resolution in today </S>",
    "<S> s best measurements of about @xmath8mev @xcite and using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) one could infer an uncertainty of momentum of @xmath9 kgms@xmath10 , and a local uncertainty @xmath11 m , or 3.1 nm . </S>",
    "<S> however , to establish that the uncertainty relations fail in this context , it is only necessary to provide an upper limit of the energy and momentum uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for an electron at the fermi level of a ag(111 ) surface the maximum available energy is given by the energy difference between the bottom of the parabolic surface state band and the energy at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> this energy is about 80 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds also to the thermal energy at ambient conditions . </S>",
    "<S> as the experiments are performed at cryogenic temperatures of 5k , the thermal energy is much lower than the band energy . </S>",
    "<S> hence the maximum uncertainty in the energy of the electron is also about 80 mev . from this value it is possible , via the energy uncertainty and the heisenberg uncertainty relations ( eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) ) , to derive the uncertainty of the x - position : @xmath12 m or about 3.5  . </S>",
    "<S> this value is about three times larger than the wigner - seitz radius ( 1.06  ) , which describes the radius of a sphere with the typical electron density found in metals . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty @xmath13 is also larger than the distance between two individual atoms on a silver surface , which is 2.9  . </S>",
    "<S> the unit cell , the wigner - seitz cell , and the uncertainty are marked in figure 1c .        </S>",
    "<S> following the standard interpretation of quantum theory the electron is a point particle . </S>",
    "<S> its appearance at a particular location is a statistical event governed by the schrdinger equation and the probability density , which is equal to the square of the electron s wavefunction , or @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the same statement is also correct for alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics , e.g. based either on the pilot - wave theory @xcite , or a theory of the dirac electron based on zitterbewegung @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the precision of an experiment will depend on the statistical variation of the electron s location and its convolution over time . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , will also influence the statistical variation of e.g. the apparent height . </S>",
    "<S> if the apparent height can be measured with a precision of less than 0.05pm , as found in experiments @xcite , then the statistical probability of an electron to be found at a particular location can only have a certain standard deviation @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> given the local uncertainty derived from the uncertainty relations , this deviation can , in principle , be linked either to a minimum number of events within the measurement interval of an stm , which is in the range of milliseconds , or to the error in the vertical distance measurement combined with the lateral resolution in the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> note that the argument differs substantially from previous analysis of stm measurements , which only considered the vertical precision : given the time resolution of the instrument and a tunneling current of 1na about 10@xmath15 electrons cross the vacuum barrier within the measurement resolution of the instrument . </S>",
    "<S> this , alone , will not be sufficient to establish the statistical facts . </S>",
    "<S> only the _ lateral resolution _ in combination with the _ vertical precision _ will be sufficient to analyze the statistics in these experiments comprehensively .    </S>",
    "<S> we have thus two possible ways in which the experimental values can be compared to the standard deviation inferred from the uncertainty relations . </S>",
    "<S> we may either find , that a threshold number of measurements n@xmath16 is necessary to obtain the experimentally observed standard deviation . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we can estimate the minimum distance covered by the electron within the time - resolution limit of stm experiments @xmath17 ( i.e. milliseconds ) , and derive a lower limit for the time - resolution of the instrument without a violation of the uncertainty relations . </S>",
    "<S> such a limit is described by : @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the total path during n@xmath16 measurements , @xmath20 is the average path from one measurement to the next , and @xmath21 is the energy uncertainty . or we may find that the calculated standard deviation is actually quite independent of the number of measurements . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the value of the standard deviation for an energy uncertainty @xmath21 can be directly compared to the maximum standard deviation of the tunneling current given the precision of the instrument . here </S>",
    "<S> , the percentage of error in an stm measurement , calculated from ratio of the error in the distance measurement divided by the apparent height of a feature , can be used , in combination with the lateral resolution of the instrument , to determine the maximum standard deviation . for an error in the experiments of 0.3% , </S>",
    "<S> which is easily obtained in today s most precise experiments , we find then : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the lateral resolution of an stm and @xmath21 the maximum energy uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> if three times the standard deviation inferred from the energy uncertainty is substantially larger than the lateral experimental resolution @xmath23 , then one of the original assumptions going into the analysis of the process must be flawed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this is indeed the case .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> we start the discussion by analyzing events at one particular pixel of the grid on the surface and analyze events from the viewpoint of one electron only . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we shall determine how the presence of many electrons at the surface could alter the initial findings .    </S>",
    "<S> the apparent height of a feature measured by stm is , for a metal surface , in the range of 10 to 200pm . for the sake of the argument , and to avoid being overly restrictive </S>",
    "<S> , we assume the vertical resolution to be 0.1pm , and the lateral resolution to be 20pm . in a wigner - seitz cell </S>",
    "<S> we then have about 88 individual pixels of stm measurements ( see figure 1d ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that the feature height is 30pm , then the experimental precision is 0.3% . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent height at an individual pixel would be affected , however , if at a given moment during the measurement interval the electron were not found at the location of this pixel , but at a neighboring pixel . thus we may say that the standard deviation of the location measurement is such that the required percentage of measurements must be at this particular location . for a variation of less than 0.3% three times the standard deviation of the measured results </S>",
    "<S> must thus still be smaller than half the distance between the pixels ( see figure 1d ) , or about 10 pm . </S>",
    "<S> the standard deviation must thus be smaller than 3.3pm . </S>",
    "<S> given that the uncertainty @xmath24pm , every single measurement event , at which the electron should be detected at the position of one pixel at @xmath25 , will lead to a statistically distributed measurement in the interval @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> we have simulated such a statistical distribution of events in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the locations of the electron are indeed randomly distributed in the interval , as required by the uncertainty relations and quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> we find a standard deviation of about 280pm for all sets of data . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the number of measurements does not change the precision , since the precision is limited by the uncertainty relations themselves . </S>",
    "<S> the precision can only be increased by an increase of the electron s energy . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath0 is about one hundred times the required value , we may say that there is a clear contradiction between the observed precision of the experiments , and the calculated uncertainty for the location of the electron . </S>",
    "<S> it is also clear that the underlying assumption , leading to this contradiction , is the statistical nature of the measurement , encoded in the uncertainty relations . </S>",
    "<S> this contradiction , moreover , is not the result of a small variation of the values obtained , but a variation of two orders of magnitude .        </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to calculate the energy necessary to obtain the precision found in the experiments . if @xmath0 has to be around 3 pm , then the necessary uncertainty will also be about 3 pm . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the momentum uncertainty has to be around @xmath28kgms@xmath10 , and the necessary energy will be more than 1000 ev . for a measurement taken at cryogenic temperatures of 5k , </S>",
    "<S> as routinely performed today , the probability of such energy , derived from the fermi - dirac distribution , is essentially zero ; the precision found in the experiments is thus impossible to explain within the framework of standard quantum theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the result would not change substantially if the precision in the experiments were somewhat lower . </S>",
    "<S> however , so far we have assumed that the uncertainty leads to a loss of electron detection at a particular point . </S>",
    "<S> it is , at least in principle , also possible , that uncertainty , via the influx of adjacent electrons at this particular point , may lead to a gain in electron detection . </S>",
    "<S> we may calculate this gain from the normal distribution for the distance from adjacent pixels and the ratio of the diameter of a pixel , or 20pm and the circumference of a circle at this distance , so that the normalized gain @xmath29 from a point at distance @xmath30 will be ( units in pm ) : @xmath31 summing up all contributions from pixels in a distance d of less than 280 pm , we obtain a value of 0.65 . for a contrast of 100 , </S>",
    "<S> corresponding to an apparent height difference of 200pm , which is easily obtained in an stm , the gain at a particular pixel should not be larger than 0.01 . </S>",
    "<S> comparing with the number obtained from a normal distribution , based on a standard deviation of 280pm and a pixel width of 20pm , or 0.65 , we see that such a contrast can not be obtained if the density of charge is assumed to be a statistical quantity complying with the uncertainty relations . </S>",
    "<S> again , the value obtained from the statistical analysis differs by about two orders of magnitude from the value inferred from the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> so that from both perspectives , the loss due to the appearance of the electron at adjacent pixels , and the gain due to the appearance of the electron statistically deviating from adjacent pixels , we arrive at the same conclusion : the precision and contrast of today s stm experiments is well beyond the requirements of the uncertainty principle . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus safe to conclude that the density of charge can not be a statistical quantity .        to show in detail , how a statistical density of electron charge complying with the uncertainty relations would affect the image of a single adatom at the silver surface , we have simulated the image of an adatom at very low bias voltage ( 20mv ) , in constant height mode at a distance of 500pm above the centre of the adatom . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows two possible images : figure 3a reflects a non - statistical measurement , where the measured current is exactly proportional to the calculated local density of states ( ldos ) , this image is very close to experimental results ( see fig . 1a , and the measurements by lian et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3b shows a hypothetical measurement , where the ldos value at every single point is affected by the random distribution of the electrons present at a given point . in this image </S>",
    "<S> we have summed up all contributions from the normal distributions of adjacent measurement points , where the amplitude is equal to the exact density of states at a given point , and its contribution to adjacent points is calculated from a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 280pm . </S>",
    "<S> we have rescaled the ensuing ldos values to the maximum value for the density . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3c shows a simulated linescan across a single adatom . here , the numerical difference is more than one order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation allows the conclusion that measurements of adatoms would not be able to show an apparent height difference of more than about 10 pm . </S>",
    "<S> this is , again , a clear contradiction with experimental results , where the apparent heights are typically larger than 100pm .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that modern stm experiments violate the heisenberg uncertainty relations by about two orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the density of electron charge is not a statistical quantity , as currently believed . in a wider context </S>",
    "<S> , it should be noted that the question of a sub - quantum theoretical framework , something which einstein or schrdinger would have called a  </S>",
    "<S> hidden variable theory  , seems to be increasingly on the agenda today . </S>",
    "<S> one reason for it is certainly the sophistication and precision of today s experiments , as analyzed in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> another , however , is dissatisfaction with a framework which does not seem to allow us insight into fundamental processes at the atomic scale . most notable in this context </S>",
    "<S> are attempts to account for the probabilistic framework of quantum mechanics by an analysis of a deeper level of description , see recent papers by khrennikov on prequantum statistical theory @xcite , by grssing et al . </S>",
    "<S> on subquantum thermodynamics @xcite , by elze on emergent quantum mechanics @xcite , and by thooft on deterministic quantum mechanics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it might be that these developments indicate that our understanding of reality is about to undergo a _ </S>",
    "<S> quantum leap _ into a new direction . </S>"
