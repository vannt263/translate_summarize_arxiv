    "a _ clustering method _ is an algorithm that takes as input a finite space with a distance function ( typically , a finite metric space ) @xmath3 and gives as output a partition of @xmath4 .",
    "kleinberg discussed in @xcite the problem of clustering in an axiomatic way and proposed a few basic properties that a clustering scheme should hold .",
    "then , he proved that no standard clustering scheme satisfying this conditions simultaneously can exist .",
    "this does not imply the impossibility of defining a consistent standard clustering algorithm .",
    "kleinberg s impossibility only holds when the unique input in the algorithm is the space and the set of distances .",
    "it can be avoided including , for example , the number of clusters to be obtained as part of the input .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also , ackerman and ben - david , see @xcite , showed that these axioms are consistent in the setting of clustering quality measures .",
    "carlsson and mmoli , see @xcite , studied the analogous problem for clustering schemes that yield hierarchical decompositions instead of a certain partition of the space .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hierarchical clustering methods also take as input a finite metric space but the output is a hierarchical family of partitions of @xmath4 .",
    "they approach the subject focusing on a theoretical basis for the study of hierarchical clustering ( @xmath5 ) . in the spirit of kleinberg",
    "s result , they define a few reasonable conditions that a @xmath5 method should hold .",
    "they prove that the unique @xmath5 method satisfying three basic conditions is ( the well - known ) single linkage hierarchical clustering , @xmath6 @xmath5 .",
    "ackerman and ben - david , see @xcite , proved also a characterization of the class of linkage - based algorithms , including @xmath6 .",
    "see also @xcite . in the setting of partitional ( standard )",
    "clustering see @xcite .",
    "carlsson and mmoli also study the theoretical properties of @xmath6 @xmath5 obtaining some interesting results .",
    "the main advantage seems to be that this method enjoys some sort of stability which is defined by means of the gromov - hausdorff distance .",
    "however , the main weakness of @xmath6 @xmath5 is the so called _ chaining effect _ which may merge clusters that , in practice , _ should be detected _ by the algorithm and kept separated .",
    "one way to address this difficulty is to take into account the density . in a preprint entitled",
    "_ multiparameter hierarchical clustering methods _ the same authors do this by including in the input of the algorithm a function that provides that information .",
    "our aim is to define a @xmath5 method which offers some solution to this particular weakness without including any extra information .",
    "the first challenge is that the concept of _ clusters that should be detected _ by the algorithm depends on the characteristics of the problem under study .",
    "the same happens with what we may consider the _ undesired _ chaining effect .",
    "the definition from lance and williams , @xcite , makes reference to the higher tendency of the points to add to a pre - existing group rather than defining the nucleus of a new group or joining to another single point .",
    "our algorithm is oriented to another aspect of the chaining effect which is the tendency to merge two clusters when the minimal distance between them is small ( even though they may have dense cores which are clearly distant apart ) .",
    "this is typically the problem of @xmath6 @xmath5 .",
    "also , we include as an undesired chaining effect the case of two big clusters joined by a chain of points or small clusters .",
    "these isolated points or small clusters may be interpreted as noise in the sample and we might want to distinguish the big picture and ignore their effect . this idea is closer to the type of chaining effect considered by wishart in @xcite .",
    "there exist other linkage - based methods that enjoy some sort of sensitivity to density and offer some resistance to these chaining effects as average linkage , @xmath7 , or complete linkage , @xmath8 .",
    "these methods are extensively used in practice . however , although the main problem of the chaining effect of @xmath6 @xmath5 is reduced , there appears another effect that might be unwanted too . in these methods",
    "the distance between a point and a cluster is greater than the minimal distance .",
    "therefore , they have a tendency to merge isolated points before joining them to pre - existing big clusters . also , these methods are proved to be extremely unstable in the sense that small perturbations on the data yield very different dendrograms .",
    "herein , we define a new @xmath5 method on the basis of @xmath6 : _ @xmath0-unchaining single linkage _ or @xmath1 .",
    "the definition of @xmath1 is based in the dimension of the rips complexes defined by the points of @xmath4 .",
    "these complexes contain some information about the density distribution of the sample .",
    "this allows us to define a density sensitive algorithm such that the input is just the set of distances between the points and a fixed parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter determines how sensitive the method will be to the chaining effect .    to treat the chaining through single points or smaller blocks , we define another version of the method , @xmath2 , by adding an extra condition on @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that ester , kriegel , sander and xu , see @xcite , defined a standard clustering method called dbscan .",
    "dbscan is also a density - sensitive algorithm where the input is just the data set and some parameters . although this is not hierarchical clustering algorithm we include a short discussion comparing the type of clusterings detected by this method with the clusterings that @xmath1 and @xmath2 may detect in the levels of the dendrogram",
    "this paper intends to give a theoretical basis to the study of the problem .",
    "so , instead of checking the algorithm on examples of real data we rather try to find general properties characterizing what would be an undesired chaining of two blocks and how good is the algorithm detecting and unchaining them .",
    "however , we include several examples where the unchaining properties can be explicitly seen in the resulting dendrogram .    to the study the chaining effect we define the concepts of _ chained subsets _ and _ subsets chained by smaller blocks _ as situations of minimal chaining so that they contain what we consider the problematic examples .",
    "nevertheless , there may be many examples of chained subsets which should be clearly merged and there is margin to be more restrictive . in such context , a @xmath5 method is _ strongly chaining _ if every pair of chained subsets are always merged before they appear contained in different clusters .",
    "a @xmath5 method is _ completely chaining _ if , in addition , every pair of subsets chained through smaller blocks are merged before they appear contained in different clusters .",
    "thus , strongly chaining methods and completely chaining methods are extremely sensitive to these effects .",
    "this is the case , for example , of @xmath6 @xmath5 .",
    "see theorem [ th : complete chaining ] .",
    "we define also precise conditions to define what we consider two blocks that should necessarily appear as independent blocks at some point .",
    "the definition considers two blocks that have dense cores and such that the minimal distance between them is small only because of a single pair of points .",
    "in particular , this pair of points creates a chaining between their dense cores .",
    "see figure [ ejp chained edge ] .",
    "this is a particular , more restrictive , example of chained subsets .",
    "we say that a @xmath5 method is _ weakly unchaining _ if , at least , it distinguishes that pair of blocks .",
    "then , we prove that @xmath1 satisfies this condition while other methods which are not strongly chaining as @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath5 fail to be weakly unchaining",
    ". see theorem [ th : weakly ] , corollary [ cor : weakly ] and example [ ejp : al - cl ] .",
    "we also define a minimal condition of two subsets chained by single points that should be detected .",
    "we say that a @xmath5 method is _ @xmath0-bridge - unchaining _ if it is able to separate two blocks in that situation .",
    "@xmath2 is proved to be more sensitive than that .",
    "it also detects some classes of chaining through smaller blocks as it is proved in proposition [ prop : moderate_2 ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 is @xmath0-bridge - unchaining .",
    "see corollary [ cor : unchaining ] .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following :    section [ section : background ] contains the basic definitions and notation involved .",
    "it may be skipped by the experts . in section [ section : hc ]",
    "we recall some well known hierachical clustering methods and include some different ways to formulate them . in section [ section : modified sl ]",

    "formal definitions are left to the last sections to enhance readability . in this section",

    "there is a well known equivalence between trees and ultrametrics .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for a complete exposition of how to build categorical equivalences between them .",
    "in particular , this may be translated into an equivalence between dendrograms and ultrametrics :    thus , a hierarchical clustering method @xmath41 can be presented as an algorithm whose output is a a dendrogram or an ultrametric space .",

    "let us recall the definition of some well - known hierarchical clustering methods .",

    "therefore , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath5 can be made _ permutation invariant _ , meaning that the result of the hierarchical clustering does not depend on the order in which the points are introduced in the algorithm .",
