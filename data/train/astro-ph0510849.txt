    "probing the masses of neutrinos has become one of the important targets in cosmology .",
    "although neutrino oscillation experiments have well measured the mass differences as @xmath0 from solar neutrino experiments @xcite and @xmath1 from atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite , they are insensitive to the absolute values of the neutrino masses . experiments using kinematical probe such as tritium decay measurements can give an upper bound on an absolute neutrino mass , however cosmology can give a more stringent bound . from the analyses of recent cosmological observations such as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , large scale structure ( lss ) and so on , we can conservatively say the current bound on the sum of neutrino masses @xmath2 is around 2 ev ( 95% c.l . ) @xcite .",
    "another important issue in cosmology is to understand the nature of dark energy .",
    "almost all current cosmological observations suggest that the present universe is dominated by an enigmatic component called dark energy .",
    "although many models for dark energy have been proposed so far , we have not pinned down the model yet . however , by parameterizing the dark energy with its equation of state @xmath3 , cosmological observations can give the constraints on @xmath3 . assuming @xmath3 being constant , the current observations give @xmath4 @xcite . furthermore , even if we allow time - varying @xmath3 and/or non - flat universe , it is shown that @xmath3 is constrained to be around a cosmological constant for some types of time variation @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the constraint on the neutrino masses from cmb , lss , type ia supernovae ( sneia ) and so on can be weakened if the equation of state for dark energy is allowed to take a value other than @xmath5 and vice versa @xcite , which means that there is a degeneracy between the neutrino masses and the equation of state for dark energy . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the equation of state for dark energy is assumed to be constant in time , however , most models of dark energy proposed so far have a time - varying equation of state .",
    "importantly it should be noticed that there are degeneracies among parameters which describe the time dependence of dark energy equation of state .",
    "for example , it was discussed that , for the models with a constant equation of state @xmath3 and a time - varying equation of state parametrized as @xmath6 , there is a degeneracy between @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the cmb power spectrum and matter power spectrum @xcite .",
    "since now we know that neutrino has a mass and the equation of state for dark energy can have the time dependence , we should take both of them into account when we consider the constraints from observations . however , considering the degeneracies discussed above , we can expect that we encounter unfortunate situations when we want to determine the neutrino masses and the evolution of dark energy simultaneously .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss to what extent we can determine the neutrino masses and the evolution of dark energy , i.e. , the time dependent equation of state , simultaneously from future cosmological observations . for this purpose ,",
    "we make use of the fisher matrix analysis using the expected data from future cmb and lss observations . in addition to them",
    ", we also consider the cross correlation between cmb and lss , which has been attracting attention of the community in recent years .",
    "in particular , we investigate the effect of the neutrino masses on the cross correlation , which has not been attempted previously in the literature . as is well known , after the universe has been dominated by dark energy ,",
    "the gravitational potential decays , which drives the so - called late integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "since the time - evolving gravitational potential that drives the isw effect may also affect large scale structure formation , the temperature fluctuation from the isw effect and the distribution of galaxy are considered to be correlated @xcite .",
    "since there is no isw effect in the universe dominated by matter , the detections of the cross correlation of the isw effect with galaxy survey is a piece of physical evidence for the existence of dark energy .",
    "the detection of the cross correlation between the wmap temperature fluctuation and several galaxy surveys have been reported in refs .",
    "many authors have discussed the cross correlation of cmb with lss to investigate the properties of dark energy and some other issues @xcite . in particular , it was shown that the cross correlation of cmb with galaxy survey can be a good probe for the evolution of dark energy @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section , first we briefly discuss the degeneracy between the neutrino masses and the equation of state for dark energy and also that in models with the time - varying equation of state .",
    "then , in section [ sec : crosscorrelation ] , we discuss the cross correlation of cmb with lss and its spectra in scenarios with massive neutrinos and dark energy with some equations of state . in section",
    "[ sec : perturbation ] , we study effects of massive neutrinos and dark energy on the suppression of growth of perturbation and the isw effect and discuss how the masses of neutrinos and the equation of state for dark energy can affect the cross correlation spectrum . in section [ sec : future ] , we discuss a future constraint on the neutrino masses and the evolution of dark energy from cmb , lss and the cross correlation of cmb and lss .",
    "we give the summary of this paper in the final section .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the degeneracy between the neutrino masses and the equation of state for dark energy @xmath3 , which was recently pointed out @xcite and also the degeneracy in the parameters which describe the time dependent @xmath3 .",
    "first we discuss the degeneracy between the neutrino masses and @xmath3 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : cmb ] and [ fig : pk ] , we show the cmb power spectra and matter power spectra respectively , for the cases with @xmath9cdm model and a model with massive neutrinos and the dark energy equation of state @xmath3 which is not equal to @xmath5 . for reference , we also plot the data from wmap3 @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmb ] and those from sdss @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] . for the @xmath9cdm model , we take the cosmological parameters as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 which are the mean value of the power - law @xmath9cdm models from wmap3 . here",

    ", we assume that the tensor mode is negligible .",
    "for the matter power spectra , we have corrected for a scale - dependent biasing following the treatment of ref .",
    "this correction affects only the scales with @xmath23mpc@xmath24 .",
    "for the model with massive neutrinos and dark energy with @xmath25 , we take the cosmological parameters as @xmath26 and @xmath27 . here",
    "we assume degenerate masses for 3 neutrino flavors and a constant @xmath3 .",
    "the energy density and the masses of neutrinos are related by @xmath28 .",
    "the other cosmological parameters are taken as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "in general , dark energy component is characterized with its equation of state @xmath34 and speed of sound @xmath35 .",
    "although the background evolution depends on @xmath3 only , the fluctuation of dark energy depends on both @xmath3 and @xmath36 . in this paper",
    ", we assume that @xmath37 , which corresponds to the case with a scalar field dark energy , where @xmath36 is defined at the rest frame of the dark energy . as seen from the figure ,",
    "these two parameter sets give almost the same spectra , which means that the values of @xmath38 from cmb and lss are almost the same . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is a degeneracy between @xmath39 and @xmath3 in the direction to the region where @xmath40 .",
    "this degeneracy can be explained as follows . to fit a model with massive neutrinos to large scale structure data ,",
    "large @xmath41 can be compensated by increasing the energy density of matter .",
    "this cancellation seems not to be allowed because , assuming a flat universe and the cosmological constant for dark energy , sneia data constrain @xmath42 to be @xmath43 . however allowing the equation of state @xmath3 to vary , large values of @xmath42",
    "are consistent with observations of sneia with smaller @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to the degeneracy in the matter power spectrum .",
    "as for cmb data , it is known that massive neutrinos affect the structure of acoustic peaks such as the position and the shape @xcite .",
    "increasing @xmath41 , the peak position shifts to lower multipoles .",
    "however , by decreasing @xmath3 , the position of the peak shifts to higher multipoles , which cancels the shift caused by increasing the value of @xmath41 .",
    "although the shape of the peaks is also slightly modified by increasing @xmath44 , by changing other cosmological parameters , we can fit such a model to cmb data well .",
    "thus by varying @xmath3 , larger values of @xmath44 become to be allowed by the data .",
    "next we discuss the degeneracy in models with dark energy with a time - varying equation of state .",
    "as mentioned above , most models of dark energy proposed so far such as quintessence have a time - dependent equation of state .",
    "thus when we consider the constraints on the equation of state for dark energy @xmath3 phenomenologically , we should accommodate the time evolution of @xmath3 in some way .",
    "although several ways have been proposed to include the time dependence of @xmath3 , here we assume a simple form as @xcite @xmath45    in figs .  [ fig : cmb ] and [ fig : pk ] , the cmb and matter power spectra for the cases with @xmath46 and @xmath47 are also plotted .",
    "other cosmological parameters are taken to be the same as the case of a constant equation of state with massive neutrinos just above .",
    "as seen from the figure , the degeneracy in the cmb and lss exists between the models with a constant @xmath3 and a time - varying @xmath3 .",
    "the degeneracy comes from the fact that both models give almost the same angular diameter distance from last scattering surface which determines the positions of the acoustic peaks in the cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the fluctuation of dark energy is almost irrelevant to the structure of the acoustic peaks , hence they give almost an identical power spectrum provided the angular diameter distances from last scattering surface are the same . a possible difference between the models with constant and time dependent @xmath3 is the isw effect which affects the low multipole region . in fact",
    ", there is a small difference in the region , however , it is not enough to differentiate them due to the cosmic variance in this case .    since there is a degeneracy between the neutrino masses and the constant equation of state for dark energy , we can expect that the situation becomes much worse when we also consider the time dependent dark energy equation of state .",
    "however , the possibility of differentiating the models with constant and time dependent @xmath3 using the cross correlation of cmb with lss has been discussed @xcite .",
    "thus we may be able to break these degeneracies using the cross correlation .",
    "before we discuss the future constraints on the masses of neutrino and dark energy evolution from cmb , lss and their cross correlation , we study the effects of them on the cross correlation of cmb with lss in the next section .",
    "in this section , first we briefly review the formulation of the cross correlation of cmb with galaxies following ref .",
    "detailed descriptions of this issue can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the two point correlation function between the isw signal and galaxy overdensity is defined as @xmath48 where the angular brackets represent the ensemble average and @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 is the temperature fluctuation from the isw effect in the direction @xmath51 which is written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the conformal time and @xmath54 is the visibility function . here a prime denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time .",
    "@xmath55 is the gravitational potential which appears in the metric perturbation in the conformal newtonian gauge as @xmath56 unless otherwise stated , we work in the conformal newtonian gauge in this paper .",
    "@xmath57 is the overdensity of galaxies in the direction @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 where @xmath60 is the mean number density of galaxies .",
    "it is assumed that the galaxy number overdensity traces the density fluctuation of matter as @xmath61 where @xmath17 represents the galaxy bias .",
    "thus @xmath62 can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the selection function of a given galaxy survey .",
    "as usual , it is convenient to decompose @xmath65 with the legendre polynomials @xmath66 as @xmath67 we subtracted the monopole and dipole contributions by construction . with the above definition",
    ", the cross - correlation power spectrum is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the primordial power spectrum .",

    "now we show the cross correlation spectrum in models introduced in the previous section .",
    "we computed the cross correlation spectra using the modified version of cmbfast @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] , we plot the cross correlation power spectrum for the same models as those in fig .  [ fig : cmb ] . here",
    "we use the normalized gaussian selection function with the peak at redshift @xmath81 and the variance @xmath82 .",
    "the other cosmological parameters are the same as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmb ] . in the figure ,",
    "the scalar amplitudes are normalized to the wmap best fit values and the bias factors are determined by the fit to sdss data .",
    "we will investigate in sec .",
    "[ sec : future ] whether or not the difference seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] can be probed by future cross - correlation data . before that ,",
    "in the next section , we investigate the cross correlation in detail , discussing the suppression of matter fluctuation and the isw effect in models with massive neutrinos and dark energy with some equations of state .",
    "in this section , we discuss the effects of massive neutrinos and dark energy with some equations of state on the suppression of fluctuation growth and the isw effect .",
    "below , the evolution of perturbation variables are calculated at the mode @xmath83mpc@xmath24 .",
    "then we study the cross correlation spectrum in the models .",
    "first we consider the effects of massive neutrinos on the suppression of fluctuation growth .",
    "since massive neutrinos represent a smooth gravitationally stable component on small scales , they suppress the growth of matter fluctuation @xcite . in linear regime",

    ", @xmath86 grows as @xmath87 .",
    "an analytic formula for the growth factor is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] , we show @xmath88 for the model with @xmath26 and @xmath89 as a function of redshift .",
    "other cosmological parameters are taken to be the same as those of the @xmath9cdm model in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmb ] .",
    "we can see the suppression of growth of matter fluctuation in models with massive neutrinos .",
    "the growth of matter fluctuation is more suppressed by increasing the masses of neutrinos .",
    "to see the isw effect in the model , we also plot @xmath90 as a function of redshift in fig .",
    "[ fig : phidot ] . as is clear from the figure , massive neutrinos have little effect on the evolution of the gravitational potential .",
    "thus the mass of neutrinos is almost irrelevant to the late isw effect , which means that we can expect that the neutrino masses have almost no effect on the cross correlation of cmb with lss except for the overall suppression of matter fluctuation .",
    "notice that , since we do not have much knowledge of the bias factor , we might not see such suppression .",
    "next we discuss the effects of dark energy on the suppression of fluctuation growth and the isw effect .",
    "first we will discuss the suppression of fluctuation growth .",
    "the growth of matter fluctuation can be described by the following equation @xcite , including the fluctuation of dark energy @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the conformal hubble parameter , @xmath93 is the density perturbation of dark energy and @xmath94 is the energy density of a component @xmath16 normalized by the total energy density at redshift @xmath95 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] , the fluctuations of matter for the cases with @xmath96 and @xmath97 are shown .",
    "the matter fluctuation is more suppressed as increasing the value of @xmath3 .",
    "this is due to the change of the background evolution by the domination of dark energy .",
    "the fluctuation of dark energy also affects the fluctuation of matter via gravity .",
    "another important effect of dark energy is the late isw effect . as is well - known , when the universe is dominated by dark energy , the gravitational potential decays , which drives the late time isw effect .",
    "the isw effect can be written as @xmath98.\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : phidot ] , the evolutions of @xmath99 as a function of redshift for several values of @xmath3 are shown .",
    "increasing the values of @xmath3 , the isw effect is more enhanced at high redshift region , which leads to enhanced cross correlation power spectra makes the epoch when the universe begins to accelerate later , then the isw effect becomes less . ] .",
    "notice that , at recent epoch , the values of @xmath100 decreases as the values of @xmath3 increases .",
    "thus the effects of @xmath3 can depend on the values of @xmath3 itself and also on the redshift .",
    "now we are in a position to discuss the cross correlation power spectrum for models with massive neutrinos and dark energy with some equations of state . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross2 ] , we show the cross correlation power spectra for the cases with the constant equations of state ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) and the time - varying equation of state @xmath103 .",
    "the case with @xmath26 and @xmath89 is also plotted .",
    "we use the same galaxy selection function as that used in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] . other cosmological parameters",
    "are taken to be the same as those of the @xmath9cdm model in fig .  [",
    "fig : cmb ] . since the masses of neutrinos",
    "suppress the growth of fluctuation , we can see the power spectrum of the cross correlation is also suppressed .",
    "although the growth of matter fluctuation can also be suppressed in the dark energy dominated universe , effects of dark energy also come from the isw effect . as the equation of state of the dark energy increases , the epoch where the energy density of dark energy dominates the universe becomes earlier than the case with the cosmological constant , which affects the evolution of the gravitational potential more at high redshift .",
    "thus it can produce the large isw signals .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the size of the isw effect also depends on the epoch we consider .",
    "thus the size of the cross correlation power spectrum depends on the values of @xmath3 , its time dependence ( i.e. , @xmath8 in our parameterization ) but also on the selection function .",
    "now we discuss attainable constraints on neutrino masses and the evolution of dark energy from future experiments of cmb , lss and the cross correlation between them .",
    "we adopt the usual fisher matrix method @xcite for this purpose .",
    "the fisher matrix is defined as @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the probability of observing a data set @xmath106 for a given cosmological parameter set @xmath107 .",
