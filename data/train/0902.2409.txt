    "in spite of the difficulties of determining the structure and dynamics of the inner 400 pc of the galaxy , remarkable progress has been made by comparing surveys in different tracers of molecular gas .",
    "these surveys have revealed the average properties of the gas @xcite . the gas is excited , dense , and exists in conditions unique in the galaxy , including high external pressures and strong magnetic fields .",
    "the most prominent line emission comes from the various rotational energy levels of @xmath0co , and surveys exist from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "it is evident from these degree - scale results that the molecular medium is not well described by its average properties , but over the past few decades a convincing picture of the galactic center has emerged .",
    "at least one stellar bar crosses the galaxy , and the @xmath10 and @xmath7 orbit families resulting from its potential contain atomic and molecular gas respectively @xcite . the molecular gas on the @xmath7 orbits is largely found in a `` galactic center ring '' ( gcr ) and is both dense and turbulent @xcite .",
    "because gas on the gcr is forming stars , it is unlikely that the molecular medium inside the @xmath10 disk is primordial , and therefore some mechanism must exist for converting atomic gas to molecular gas .",
    "the region in between the atomic disk and the gcr , the site of the bar s inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) , is where the transition occurs , and is thought to contain two dust lanes in small spiral arms where molecule - forming shocks and sprays occur @xcite .",
    "the gcr and surrounding molecular gas near these dust lanes are collectively known as the `` central molecular zone '' ( cmz ) .",
    "the most obvious failure of this model is that it has not yet explained the asymmetric distribution of gas around the dynamical center of the galaxy , sgr a * , although @xcite argue that the gcr may be accreting from only one side .",
    "this simple picture is remarkable considering the observed complexity of the region .",
    "however , it necessarily overlooks details critical to a complete understanding .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the specific nature of the process converting atomic gas to molecular gas . that the dust lanes are the site of molecule - forming shocks is likely given the absence of star formation , and studies in line ratios tracing shock chemistry",
    "indicate that the lanes contain shocked gas @xcite , but the shock environment has yet to be explored in detail .",
    "pre- and post - shock environments appear as relative voids in @xmath11 diagrams ; the emptiness of the region varies with the choice of spectral line , but even in @xmath0co ( 10 ) , it is clear that there are empty regions within the cmz , inside what @xcite saw as the `` co parallelogram '' and earlier studies identified as an `` expanding molecular ring . ''",
    "this boundary is likely several structures including the molecule - forming shock zones @xcite , and since shocked gas must fall farther into the galactic potential , the relative paucity of emission interior to the parallelogram is interesting .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the voids including ( 1 ) the shocked gas primarily joins the @xmath7 disk at certain regions ( e.g. the @xmath12 cloud ) , ( 2 ) the filling factor of shocked gas in these regions is too low to be seen by large - scale surveys ( along the lines of the suggestion of @xcite ) , ( 3 ) the newly - formed molecular bundles are extremely diffuse or not emissive , or a combination of the above .",
    "we expect that studying the post - shock side of the dust lanes will provide information regarding the state in which the gas arrives on the @xmath7 disk , and may also be a useful contrast to molecular cloud formation in dust lane shocks in the disk .",
    "motivated by published data @xcite , we chose to observe the area near a bright molecular cloud near the far side dust lane at @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 km s@xmath6 which lies in such a void in @xmath0co ( 10 ) and hcn ( 10 ) surveys @xcite .",
    "historically , this cloud has been of interest because of its coincidence on the sky with the low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) candidate known as the `` great annihilator '' ( _ einstein _ source 1e 1740.7 - 2942 ) .",
    "the great annihilator is a bright x - ray and @xmath16-ray source and was originally thought to be a black hole accreting directly from a host molecular cloud which , in turn , was brightened by the association @xcite .",
    "the original hypothesis of bondi - hoyle accretion from the ism is almost certainly incorrect given the present understanding of the system as a lmxb @xcite , but as @xcite proposed a correlation in spatial distribution of lmxb systems and diffuse @xmath16-ray emission in the galaxy , the strong and narrow annihilation line still makes the possibility of physical association intriguing . historically , the two strongest pieces of evidence for such an association were the stated small probability ( @xmath17% ) of a chance association with a bright molecular cloud in the region @xcite and the apparent offset in hco@xmath18 ( 10 ) emission from the jets seen with the vla @xcite .",
    "this offset was attributed to the high levels of ionization which would destroy the hco@xmath18 close to the black hole , and @xcite suggested that hcn may be able to survive in more highly - ionized gas , proposing future observations .",
    "our interest in the gas dynamics of the inner galaxy led us to consider the great annihilator region as a target for a pathfinding observation for two reasons : ( 1 ) the bright cloud is in a `` post - shock void '' region and ( 2 ) it has a well documented brightness and spectrum in several molecular lines @xcite .",
    "this cloud is thus a reliable pathfinder target for a larger map in the region near the shock zones .",
    "it is desirable to have a known bright target included in a wide field both for orientation and determining the suitability of a given instrument to our science goals . additionally , even supposing the lmxb is responsible for the _ brightness _ of the @xmath15 km s@xmath6 cloud , it is not responsible for the _ presence _ of the dense gas .",
    "the detection of one bright cloud , therefore , suggests the presence of additional molecular gas .      however , it is imperative to consider whether the small region near the great annihilator is typical of the void regions we wish to study ; determining whether a relative void is `` typical '' requires choosing a scale .",
    "we do this by considering both an observational strategy and our broader science goals .",
    "we have reason to expect the detection of emission in these voids based on the publically - available @xcite @xmath0co ( 10 ) data . in the published @xmath19 maps of this data , which have been integrated over several 1@xmath20 grid points in latitude , the relative voids appear empty , but an examination of the @xmath19 maps for each slice in latitude shows faint molecular emission in parts of these regions .",
    "an absolute void across all latitude slices is probably actually empty , but when integrating across several slices , a faint structure with little extent in latitude will become fainter relative to extended structures nearby .",
    "for example , in the @xcite data between @xmath21 , there appears to be a bridge of emission between the co parallelogram shock lanes and the @xmath7 orbits at @xmath22 , @xmath23 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this emission occurs in a region we would expect to be mostly empty according to bar parameters such as those in @xcite , but may be related to the highly excited bundles of gas seen in earlier @xcite work .",
    "closer to the galactic plane , this bridge does not appear , whereas the surrounding @xmath7 disk and shock lane structures persist at the same longitudes ; the region appears in the integrated map only as a void .",
    "interior to the co parallelogram , a `` typical '' region for detailed study ought to be large enough to probe both the apparently empty regions as well as some of the faint emission .    for a detailed interferometric study of the region",
    ", the scale should clearly be much larger than an individual molecular cloud s size , and we postulate that the projected radius of the cloud associated with the great annihilator is typical . assuming interaction with the lmxb as well as some intrinsic brightness , this _ measured _ radius is only influenced by the presence of the lmxb to the extent that the lmxb is responsible for the brightness of the cloud , i.e. the ratio between excitation produced by the great annihilator s particle emission and that produced by other means .",
    "based on the evidence for a well - defined spectral peak at @xmath15 km s@xmath6 centered spatially at some distance from the lmxb , as well as the physical arguments for how far the positrons could travel @xcite , it seems likely that the measured radius is close to the physical one . as discussed in  1.1 ,",
    "the lmxb may not be physically associated with the cloud at all .",
    "the field of view must be large enough to isolate individual molecular clouds of this size ( or small structures ) , but small enough that good @xmath24 coverage and sensitivity can be achieved over the entire field of view . a happy spatial medium exists for fields several arcminutes in radius ; the known cloud has a radius on the order of 1 pc ( @xmath25 for a distance of 8.5 kpc ) and a field several arcminutes ( @xmath26 pc ) on a side could accommodate many such clouds . for the velocity coverage",
    ", while constrained by the correlator for a given observation , we must appeal to the @xmath19 maps of the @xcite data and the theoretical models we wish to test @xcite .",
    "an inspection of the @xmath0co ( 10 ) data suggests that the easiest way to view a sizable segment of the post - shock region at once is to observe near one of the vertical segments of the shock lanes as projected in the @xmath19 plane thanks to our large range in @xmath27 compared to @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "we also wish to avoid contamination from line - of - sight molecular emission and larger scale structures of the inner galaxy . for this study , we mapped a region near the great annihilator described by @xmath30 and @xmath31 km s@xmath6 which meets these criteria .    in  2",
    "we discuss in detail our observations of the cloud and its environs with both the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) and the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , in  3 and 4 our results and analysis , and in  5 the implications of our results , including an assessment of whether our region is `` typical . ''",
    "the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) is a heterogenous interferometric array made up of six 10.4 and nine 6.1 m radio dishes located at 2195 m at cedar flat in the inyo mountains of california .",
    "the observatory operates in several different configurations .",
    "we report here on two tracks in the compact august 2007 e - array and one track in the april 2008 d - array ( table [ obstable ] ) towards the great annihilator cloud in hcn @xmath8 ( 88.63 ghz ) and hco@xmath18 @xmath8 ( 89.19 ghz ) . for these tracks",
    ", we made mosaicked maps towards , but slightly offset from , the peak of emission in the @xcite hco@xmath18 ( 1 - 0 ) map at 17:40:43.0 -29:43:25.0 ( 1950.0 ) .",
    "the hcn and hco@xmath18 observations were conducted simultaneously with both lines in the upper sideband and with a velocity range of -90 to -190 km s@xmath6 . for one of the e - array tracks ( baselines 866 m ) and",
    "the d - array track ( baselines 8108 m ) , the weather was excellent , whereas the second e - array track produced usable data requiring substantial flagging .",
    "visibilities in the e - array which had one antenna shadowing another were discarded . while the shortest baselines tracing the largest structures are lost in this procedure ,",
    "the e - array data considered by itself nonetheless reproduces the d - array detections wheree the fields overlap .",
    "importantly , the e - array includes numerous shorter , non - shadowed baselines significantly different from those in the d - array , producing significantly improved @xmath24 coverage . to calibrate and analyze the data , we employed the miriad software package @xcite .",
    "we customized a standard script provided by carma to inspect the data , apply calibrations and flags , and extract clean maps .",
    "we used an sdi clean algorithm to generate the maps presented here ; a check against a maximum entropy deconvolution scheme showed no significant differences .",
    "[ hcnmap ] & [ hcomap ] show the integrated amplitude maps for the combined calibrated d & e - array data , and it is immediately obvious that there is a large number of features , some of which are spatially resolved , and that many of these features are weak or absent in the hco@xmath18 data .",
    "the clouds are dense and the spatial coverage of our @xmath32 field between -90 and -190 km s@xmath6 is about 25% . at a glance , it is clear that we see a large number of features which may have small filling factors in larger beams or survey grids .",
    "we clearly detect the great annihilator cloud ( labeled cloud 1 ) to the left of map center .",
    "note that because there were fewer e - array mosaic pointings than in d - array ( table [ obstable ] ) , the snr decreases towards the map edge . because the map contains negative amplitudes , and features at different velocities may overlap spatially",

    "[ jcmtmap ] is in agreement with the carma maps and the @xcite hco@xmath18 ( 10 ) map .",
    "the presence of a number of bright regions in figs . [ hcnmap ] & [ hcomap ] and the suggestion that these regions may be quite excited is an important result . to measure the properties of these regions",
    ", we used the clumpfind algorithm @xcite using the average rms noise per spectral channel within @xmath41 of map center and requiring 60 pixels per clump ( about twice the area ) .",
    "clumps found at @xmath42 reside in the low - signal map edge , and were therefore rejected , although we found additional structure in the map edge we do not further discuss here .",
    "the clumpfind results are given in table [ measuredtable ] and are consistent with a visual inspection in that the same regions are identified . because clumpfind treats pixels along the @xmath43-axis no differently than the spatial pixels , many of the clumps reported are spatially unresolved at the @xmath44 level , and in extracting spectra for these cases we use the beamsize instead of the reported clumpfind radii . in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] we show the spectra extracted for these clumps ; for convenience , where clumpfind found multiple clumps which appear to be associated along all three axes we have extracted one average spectrum for the region using the miriad imspect task .",
    "these spectra were extracted from roughly the 2@xmath45 contour tracing the association boundaries .",
    "using clumpfind introduced a systematic bias into the sizes of the clumps along the spatial and @xmath43-axis , and we discuss the implications of this bias on our derived masses in  4.1 .      for our analysis ,",
    "we divide our clumps into resolved associations and unresolved individual clumps , where the former are identified as groups of clumps in the same region of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the resolved clumps have characteristic scales of @xmath46 pc ( @xmath25 at a distance of 8.5 kpc ) and , in some cases , several resolved regions may themselves be associated ; we consider cloud 2 to be a molecular cloud containing multiple dense regions since we see nearby negative dips at similar peak velocities .",
    "hereafter we adopt `` cloud '' to refer to resolved associations of clumps found with clumpfind and `` clump '' to refer to any individual component or unresolved feature .",
    "the resolved clouds are labeled 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , and these are the brightest features in the map ; the fainter clouds are unresolved , but may have extended structure we would see with a deeper integration . in the case of clump 2b ,",
    "the algorithm found two clumps in the hcn data which are spatially coincident and differ by 5 km s@xmath6 along the @xmath43-axis , but a detailed inspection of the channel maps ( figs . [ hcnchannel ] & [ hcochannel ] ) convince us that clumpfind ought not to have found two clumps .",
    "similarly , two clumps were found in cloud 3 where a visual inspection suggests that they should be considered one structure .",
    "the clumps are listed as the algorithm found them in table [ measuredtable ] , and we use the results from the algorithm through the rest of the analysis , but we note that there may be systematic inaccuracies with our approach . all other clumps found by clumpfind passed visual inspection .",
    "the hcn and hco@xmath18 line strength is comparable in about half of the clumps ; perhaps interestingly , only cloud 1 has a significantly stronger hco@xmath18 line . on average , where hco@xmath18 emission is present , the fwhm line widths are comparable to the hcn despite differing line strengths .",
    "the lines are roughly symmetric , but we lack the signal to rigorously investigate the line profiles .",
    "measured fwhm line widths for individual clumps range from 314 km s@xmath6 whereas average line widths for the clouds as presented in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] range from 830 km s@xmath6 , assuming the line is adequately represented by a single gaussian component .",
    "as expected , many of the clumps and associations are seen within the faint emission described in  1.2 ( fig .",
    "[ lvmap ] ) .",
    "clump 1 , associated with 1e 1740.7 - 2942 , is closer to the @xmath7 orbits and may not be part of the same structure .",
    "another group of clumps lies near -180 km s@xmath6 and may lie on the @xmath7 orbits , but the grouping in @xmath47 and @xmath48 suggests that these clumps are actually on non - circular orbits , since they are grouped between @xmath49 and there is a relative _ lack _ of emission where the gcr intersects our region in the @xcite data .",
    "the apparent clustering in fig . [ lvmap ] is largely a result of plotting all the clumps found with clumpfind and , when associations such as cloud 2 are considered as one object at some average @xmath11 , the clumps appear randomly distributed ( in latitude , they are distributed preferentially towards the galactic equator , and we do not have data for @xmath50 ) . if the clouds were on @xmath7 orbits , we would expect them to be clustered towards larger negative @xmath43 near -180 km s@xmath6 at @xmath51 .",
    "the isolated clumps and associations of gas are isolated from one another along all three axes such that it seems unlikely that they are part of one larger complex .",
    "this implies that the `` bridges '' seen in @xmath19 slices of the @xcite data are not coherent structures , but rather , the coherent structures exist on smaller scales .",
    "we remark on the individual clouds below .",
    "cloud 1 is the molecular cloud associated with 1e 1740.7 - 2942 and is the only cloud in the sample for which the hco@xmath18 line is much stronger than the hcn line . in the carma maps , we do not see the extended structure to the south which @xcite attribute to different ionization regimes near the jets of 1e 1740.7 - 2942 , but we do see some low - signal emission to the southeast ( clump 15 ) at about -130 km s@xmath6 which may be the `` ridge '' they describe . the jcmt map does not extend far enough to assess the presence of clump 15 in co @xmath40 , but clearly shows that the highly - excited co traces the hco@xmath18 well in the region observed and that the cloud is compact .",
    "clumps 11a and 11b at -180 km s@xmath6 are spatially coincident with cloud 1 , and may be physically associated with each other . in ",
    "5.2 we discuss how these results bear on a possible physical association with 1e 1740.7 - 2942 .",
    "the clumps labeled 2a-2d are each resolved individually , but are close on the sky , have nearly identical peak velocities , and are near strong negatives in the deconvolved maps which also appear at the same velocity .",
    "these negatives indicate large - scale structure resolved out by the interferometer and motivate a physical picture of several dense clumps within a diffuse envelope .",
    "the hcn and hco@xmath18 line strengths are roughly equal in each cloud , and 2b has the brightest peak flux in the map ( fig .",
    "[ spectra ] shows the hco@xmath18 in cloud 1 as stronger because it is summed over an extraction box ) .",
    "however , cloud 2b coincides on the sky with a smaller clump at -180 km s@xmath6 which makes the integrated amplitude in the region in figs .",
    "[ hcnmap ] and [ hcomap ] significantly brighter than the contribution from 2b alone .",
    "since the hco@xmath18 emission is weaker than the hcn , 2c is not identified as a clump in the hco@xmath18 data and is rather split into two tails extending from 2b and 2d .",
    "we assume that because it is identified as a separate clump in hcn that it ought to be identified separately from the two brighter emission cores .",
    "this cloud is curious , since the average fwhm line width over the association is significantly smaller in hco@xmath18 than hcn despite the strong emission in both lines .",
    "this effect is noticeable in the individual clumps found in the region , and is pronounced even when the spectrum is extracted from a box within contours @xmath52 , indicating that perhaps the hco@xmath18 in the cloud is confined to the densest regions .",
    "clouds 4a and 4b have similar peak velocities and line widths in their average spectra , and both are much weaker in the hco@xmath18 line than the hcn .",
    "the clouds are notable for their broad lines which clumpfind breaks up into strings of smaller clumps at similar velocities .",
    "the similar peak velocities mean that 4a and 4b are physically separated by @xmath53 and suggest they are or were part of the same complex , although we do not see negative amplitudes that would point to a diffuse envelope .",
    "cloud 6 is similar in line width , size , and line strength to either component of cloud 4 , but it is several arcminutes away .",
    "this cloud is close on the sky to cloud 6 and is similarly weak in hco@xmath18 , so the extracted spectrum includes a small portion of cloud 6 which appears as a weak feature at -125 km s@xmath6 .",
    "cloud 5 is the only certainly resolved cloud at -180 km s@xmath6 , although clump 17 behind cloud 2b may barely be resolved .      as mentioned above",
    ", several clumps listed in table [ measuredtable ] appear in the channel maps and not in the integrated amplitude maps .",
    "this occurs either when the clump coincides with another cloud on the sky ( as in the case of clump 17 behind 2b ) or with a negative at a different @xmath43 ( as in the case of clump 9 ) .",
    "the `` unresolved '' clumps do not appear to be a distinct population from the resolved clouds , and are instead characterized by weaker emission .",
    "we extracted average spectra from regions of about a beamsize ; clumpfind does find smaller spatial sizes for these clumps than for the ones comprising resolved associations .",
    "the line widths of the unresolved clumps are in agreement with those of the resolved ones .",
    "we have detected @xmath54 clumps of gas in a 3@xmath20-radius field .",
    "these clumps have @xmath55 pc ( assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc ) and may reside in clouds with radii of a few parsecs .",
    "the clumps have line widths , fluxes , positions , and peak velocities that make it difficult to characterize them as different parts of the same structure . integrating across @xmath56 km s@xmath6",
    ", the clumps cover about 25% of our field .",
    "the gas tends to emit more strongly in hcn than hco@xmath18 , and at least one of these clouds ( cloud 1 ) produces a @xmath0co ( 65 ) line which traces the hco@xmath18 and hcn gas quite well , meaning the cloud is highly excited . surveys in @xmath0co ( 43 ) emission show that clouds near our field are excited , although we know from comparing the jcmt @xmath0co ( 65 ) and unpublished @xmath0co ( 21 ) data that not all gas in the region is so highly excited .",
    "we now use these measured properties to derive additional quantities for our clouds , and on the basis of these results , propose that the sources are dense ( @xmath57 @xmath2 ) , and that they have shocked recently . because of the weakness of the hco@xmath18 in many of the clumps , our arguments regarding the dense gas rely on the hcn data .",
    "mass estimates invariably reflect their underlying physical assumptions , so further testing of these assumptions is required to assess their accuracy .",
    "the virial mass in particular is very uncertain for galactic center clumps .",
    "although the external pressures appear to be an order of magnitude too low to bind clumps on our scales @xcite , the clumps may be bound by the strong magnetic fields known to exist in the galactic center , or may be unbound .",
    "the virial mass is primarily useful as a way to compare our results to other work in the absence of better estimators but adopting values from previous work is fraught with peril , since the structure observed is necessarily dependent on the beamsize .",
    "the sensitivity of the virial mass to line width means that whether we take @xmath58 , where a cloud is made up of clumps with mass @xmath59 , or @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is taken from an average description such as fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , will influence our results .",
    "the line width ",
    "size relation @xcite can not be used to resolve such ambiguity because in our case it is systematic .",
    "reported line widths also generally appear to reflect the beamsize used .",
    "we investigated the extent to which noise influences clumpfind in order to determine whether multiple clumps found in resolved clouds accurately describe substructure .",
    "there is almost certainly substructure present : the question is whether clumpfind accurately detects it .",
    "a visual inspection of the channel maps in addition to testing clumpfind s behavior with artificial resolved clouds in a featureless corner of our map convinced us that the two clumps found in both 2b and 3 in the hcn are not real , and that a single clump is a better description . on the other hand , using the line width from the average spectra in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] likely overestimates the mass more severely than clumpfind underestimates it .",
    "we therefore report the clumpfind results and posit that the masses and densities contained in the resolved clouds are somewhat higher .",

    "we know the clouds must be dense , since typical critical densities for hcn ( 1 - 0 ) are @xmath65 @xmath2 , so the assumption that they are gravitationally bound is not wholly unreasonable , although a shock compression might induce similar densities which would then dissipate .",
    "the line widths indicate macroscopic turbulent support and are roughly symmetric , so if the clouds are bound , they are unlikely to be much more concentrated than at virialized relaxation .",
    "we posit that for dense , non - collapsing gas the virial mass is an adequate order of magnitude description , but note that other mass estimates from studies with larger beamsizes disagree with the virial mass by up to an order of magnitude @xcite .    in the resolved clouds our derived densities range from @xmath66 @xmath2 and ,",
    "as we stated , we believe our results understimate the _ virial _ mass",
    ". if the lte mass is a better descriptor of the `` real '' mass @xcite , then our densities are @xmath67 times too high and , therefore , typical for galactic center clumps with radii 210 times larger than those of our clumps .",
    "if our clumps are smaller structures inside larger diffuse clouds such as those resolved with larger beams , then they must either be much more dense than @xmath68 @xmath2 , or else comprise most of the mass and volume of their hosts ; for clumps @xmath67 times larger in _ radius _ the latter seems unlikely .",
    "the convergence of the critical density and size arguments lends some credence to the virial estimates as an order of magnitude estimate , so we believe our resolved clouds contain large amounts of gas at densities exceeding @xmath69 @xmath2 .",
    "the brightnesses and line widths of the unresolved clumps suggest that they contain gas at similar densities , so we estimate that the total mass contained in our cube is @xmath70 , contained in parsec - scale bundles with a small filling factor .",
    "we note that since the hco@xmath18 line widths generally disagree with the hcn in a given cloud , the hco@xmath18 virial masses would be different , but the hco@xmath18 lines have a lower snr , making the measurements more uncertain .      independently of the virial mass , we know the density to be quite high from the critical density required to excite hcn ( 10 ) . in an inspection of 2mass j ,",

    "@xmath71 , is about @xmath69 yr ( table [ derivedtable ] ) for our resolved clouds . assuming a circular orbit at 180 pc from the galactic center with a velocity of 200 km s@xmath6 ( the highest lsr velocities seen in the co parallelogram @xcite )",
    ", the orbital period is @xmath72 yr , over an order of magnitude greater than the dynamical timescale .",
    "it is likely that the clumps have recently fallen onto their present orbits , so they probably experienced a recent shock .",
    "however , the constituents of cloud 2 suggest that condensation and collapse may occur .",
    "the @xcite hypothesis identifying the co parallelogram with the ilr of the galactic bar may not be correct in detail @xcite , but the identification of the co parallelogram with starless dust lane shock zones @xcite strengthens the proposed mechanism for molecule formation in shocks near the ilr .",
    "the large surface density of molecular gas in the galactic center and orbit families in the barred potential make it all but certain that continuous inflow from the hi disk occurs .",
    "the density , excitation , and @xmath11 distribution of our clumps suggests that we are indeed seeing molecular gas which has recently formed in these shock zones . owing to their density ,",
    "the clumps represent a significant amount of mass ( @xmath73 in our field ) ; this mass is in a region where the orbits guarantee eventual transport to the @xmath7 disk .",
    "this mass is transported in small bundles , possibly as a spray of material from streamer collisions .",
    "if these bundles are unbound and decompress , diffuse molecular gas may rain down onto the gcr , otherwise they may experience ballistic impacts with the diffuse molecular envelopes in the gcr .",
    "the small filling factor of the dense regions may also explain the voids seen in larger surveys , although , as noted in  1.2 , larger - scale diffuse emission was detected in the @xcite maps in the region .",
    "we expect that regions of similar size in the cmz where faint emission is hidden by integration across latitude slices should contain gas similar to what we see .",
    "since the gas must be on self - intersecting orbits , the voids may also imply a characteristic timescale for clumps to fall to the @xmath7 disk .",
    "there are two challenges to the proposal outlined above .",
    "first , the clumps and clouds may be associated by a larger , bridge - like structure .",
    "this would imply a directed mass flow at certain points on the co parallelogram rather than a large number of small bundles of shocked gas distributed throughout the region in between the shock lanes and the @xmath7 orbits .",
    "second , the multiple constituents of cloud 2 in a larger envelope ( but still small on the scales of large surveys ) suggest that condensation into dense clumps , as seen in galactic molecular clouds , may take place under higher pressures .",
    "the first case is difficult to assess because a close inspection of individual latitude slices of the @xcite @xmath0co ( 10 ) data shows many small features in between the co parallelogram of @xcite and the gcr .",
    "we consider it unlikely that these represent steady - state channels for mass flow because of the nature of the self - intersecting @xmath10 orbits interior to the ilr .",
    "however , it is possible that material from molecular and atomic gas clouds shredded in the shock lanes maintains some coherent structure as it dissipates angular momentum .",
    "the second challenge may fit neatly into the first if larger structures fall onto the self - intersecting @xmath10 orbits , but aside from the constituents of cloud 2 , we see little evidence for dense bridges between otherwise distinct clumps .",
    "furthermore , we see no evidence for star formation , so even internal turbulent shocks must have been recent .",
    "if a mechanism for recent shocks is required , the proximity to the shock lanes provides a natural explanation .    to determine whether the great annihilator region appears typical",
    ", we applied the scale of our map ( @xmath74 km s@xmath6 ) to other areas along the shock lanes labeled in @xcite using the @xcite data cube . for the diagonal portions of the co parallelogram",
    ", we stretched our scale in longitude and shrunk it in @xmath27 . ignoring the regions near @xmath75",
    "km s@xmath6 and obvious large scale structures such as the gcr , we find that the 1e 1740.7 - 2942 region for our observation is typical of the post - shock regions in the @xmath0co ( 10 ) map .",
    "the emission associated with this region in the @xcite data appears to come from a structure covering @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we think it unlikely that the structure is bridged to the @xmath7 orbits based on a detailed inspection of the region at different emission contour intervals .",
    "we therefore have no reason to believe that the presence of the great annihilator in the region detracts from a gas - dynamical analysis .",
    "however , we note that this analysis assumes that the _ observed _ similarities between regions in the @xcite @xmath0co ( 10 ) maps correspond to _ physical _ similarities in the environments of the shock lanes . although the region is small , our results are largely consistent with the @xcite theory of molecule - forming shocks at the ilr even though , in detail , the scenario is more complex .",
    "if we are seeing clumps that have recently shocked , it is harder to fit them into alternative pictures explaining the co parallelogram , e.g. an `` expanding molecular ring '' or the @xcite proposal of a stalled ring of gas accumulating from the true ilr farther away from the galactic center .    we know that the gmcs on the @xmath7 disk are forming stars from cores in clumps , but we do not know whether the clumps primarily form via condensation or external perturbation , nor the filling factor of small clumps in gas accreting onto these orbits .",
    "@xcite find in their sticky - particle hydrodynamical models that the steady - state @xmath7 disk contains a large number of strongly shocked clumps of gas , although the decompression timescale suggests that if the clouds are still dense , they must be at least gravitationally bound if they experience no additional shocks interior to the dust lanes .",
    "their simulations also find that although there are places where shocked gas preferentially joins the @xmath7 disk ( e.g. the @xmath79 near- side molecular complex ) , bundles of gas fall in from the shock zone at the ilr at many angles .",
    "@xcite admit that their results are only marginally successful at reproducing the features of the galactic center , and subsequent models ( e.g. @xcite ) have done much better . yet",
    "the results we present here suggest that at least the accretion of material onto the @xmath7 disk in the form of dense bundles is still a possibility .",
    "our data provide useful contrasts to two of the arguments made previously for a physical association between 1e 1740.7 - 2942 and cloud 1 , but we can not rule out a possible association .",
    "the argument in favor of physical association due to a small chance of coincidental superposition of a black hole with a bright molecular cloud depends in detail on choosing a cutoff brightness .",
    "the 5 - 7% chance previously reported @xcite relied on studying the density of peaks in molecular line surveys near the galactic center using some brightness criterion . without establishing a similar criterion",
    ", we can not directly compute the probability of a chance association .",
    "however , the presence of a large number of clumps in the region with similar line widths and a wide range of peak fluxes suggests that a highly excited clump is common enough not to require association with a black hole . at approximately the 2@xmath45 contour ,",
    "the chance of coincidental superposition with _ any _ clump in our field is 25% . that the hco@xmath18 is noticeably stronger in cloud 1 is unusual , but there are smaller clumps where hco@xmath18 is stronger than hcn . with a larger velocity range ,",
    "the chance of coincidental superposition at arbitrary velocity may well increase .    the @xcite argument in favor of physical proximity relies on the interpretation of a ridge of hco@xmath18 emission parallel to the vla jets associated with 1e 1740.7 - 2942 as evidence for an ionization rate gradient .",
    "their ridge is significant ( @xmath80 ) and separated from the vla jets by @xmath81 with a peak velocity close to -140 km s@xmath6 , suggesting that it is part of the same structure as cloud 1 , shown in fig . 2 in @xcite .",
    "the primary detection of cloud 1 in their ovro map agrees well with both our carma and jcmt data in spatial extent , but we do not detect the southern ridge apparent in their map . instead , we see clump 15 at -130 km s@xmath6 to the south_east _ of cloud 1  it is closer to the vla jets than @xmath81 .",
    "an inspection of clump 15 in @xmath11 space shows a clear separation between it and cloud 1 .",
    "moreover , this clump is detected in the jcmt @xmath0co ( 21 ) data ( not shown ) whereas we do not see it in @xmath0co ( 65 ) .",
    "@xcite also detect the clump in @xmath0co ( 21 ) and not in cs ( 21 ) .",
    "there is undoubtedly emission to the south of cloud 1 , but it is not as excited or warm as cloud 1 , nor do we see evidence for a `` ridge '' linking it to cloud 1 .",
    "these results call into question whether an ionization rate gradient exists .",
    "furthermore , @xcite argue , based on their model , that if the hco@xmath18 ridge is caused by an ionization rate gradient , we would expect to see hcn molecules surviving closer to the black hole .",
    "there is no evidence in our maps that hcn emission associated with cloud 1 is closer to the _ chandra _ x - ray source than the hco@xmath18 .",
    "our results make it more difficult to make the case for physical proximity between the great annihilator and cloud 1 .",
    "we have used carma d & e - array observations in tandem with jcmt data to study the region near 1e 1740.7 - 2942 , a relative `` void '' in @xmath11 diagrams of @xmath0co survey data .",
    "the most important result of our work is the discovery that even in the regions with low average emissivity , there is a substantial amount of mass ( @xmath82 ) contained in small , dense , excited regions implying a recent shock .",
    "these bundles have scales of @xmath46 pc and appear randomly distributed in @xmath11 space , so shocks or sprays in the nearby dust lanes of the co parallelogram naturally explain our observations . the small filling factor of the dense bundles accounts for why they are not seen or only faintly present in large surveys .",
    "we investigate in detail the relationship between cloud 1 and the lmxb 1e 1740.7 - 2942 and argue that the probability of coincidental superposition with excited gas is higher than originally estimates , and that we see no evidence for a proposed ionization rate gradient ; we can explain why cloud 1 is excited in the jcmt map without invoking a black hole .",

    "<S> we report on combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) and james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) observations toward the _ einstein _ source 1e 1740.7 - 2942 , a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) commonly known as the `` great annihilator . '' </S>",
    "<S> the great annihilator is known to be near a small , bright molecular cloud in a region largely devoid of emission in @xmath0co surveys of the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> this region is of interest because it is interior to the dust lanes which may be the shock zones where atomic gas from the hi nuclear disk is converted into molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the region is populated with a large number of dense ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) regions of excited gas with small filling factors . </S>",
    "<S> the gas appears to have turbulent support and may be the result of sprays of material from collisions in the shock zone . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that @xmath3 of shocked gas resides in our @xmath4 , @xmath5 km s@xmath6 field . if this gas has recently shocked and is interior to the inner lindblad resonance of the dominant bar , it is in transit to the @xmath7 disk , suggesting that a significant amount of mass may be transported to the disk by a low filling factor population of molecular clouds with low surface brightness in larger surveys . </S>"
