    "it is well known that spherically - symmetric sources such as stars can be modelled in the simplest way by the interior and exterior schwarzschild solutions . but to include the radiation outside a star , more complicated solutions are required.@xcite these include the vaidya metric which uses a retarded time coordinate to describe a radiating atmosphere,@xcite the metrics of herrera and coworkers wherein spheres of matter are matched to exterior spacetimes,@xcite@xmath0@xcite and the metrics of glass and krisch which extend the vaidya solution to include both a radiation field and a string fluid.@xcite recently , liu and wesson presented a new kind of solutions in which the metric is time - dependent ( but not of the vaidya form ) and the energy - momentum tensor is of the form of a perfect fluid for radiation plus a radial heat flow.@xcite clearly , this solution describes sources which are time - dependent and spherically symmetric .",
    "however , we wish to know specifically what kind of sources the solution represents . in this paper",
    "we will show that it can describe * exterior * fields of a contracting ( or expanding ) star immersed in a homogenous and isotropic background radiation .",
    "campbell s theorem says that any 4d einstein solution with a source can be locally embedded in a 5d manifold _ without _ sources whose field equations in terms of the ricci tensor are @xmath1.@xcite ( here and elsewhere lower case greek letter run 0,123 and uppercase latin letters run 0 , 123 , 4 , and we use units @xmath2 . ) a major application of campbell s theorem is to study embeddings of known 4d einstein solutions in 5d ricci flat manifolds.@xcite another application of the theorem is to generate new 4d solutions from known 5d ricci flat solutions.@xcite@xmath3@xcite in the following we will show briefly how a new 4d solution is generated in ref.[7 ] .",
    "for the purpose of convenience , some of the equations and notations in ref .",
    "[ 7 ] will be re - expressed .    in reference",
    "[ 7 ] , liu and wesson presented a class of 5d solutions .",
    "this class of solutions is time - dependent in 5d and spherically symmetric in 3d with the 5d metric being @xmath4 -\\left ( 1-\\lambda t\\right ) ^{-4}dy^2\\ ; ,   \\label{5metr}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a constant and the two functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 are determined by @xmath8 where a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "clearly , ( [ bprime ] ) and ( [ aprime ] ) can be solved , at least numerically , by imposing boundary conditions on @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this 5d solution satisfies the 5d equations @xmath1 and therefore is 5d empty .",
    "however , the 4d part of the 5d metric ( [ 5metr ] ) , together with the two equations ( [ bprime ] ) and ( [ aprime ] ) , defines a 4d solution as shown in the following:@xcite @xmath12 \\quad ,   \\label{4metr}\\ ] ] @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an effective or induced energy - momentum tensor with @xmath16 it was also shown in ref.[7 ] that this @xmath15 can be modeled as a perfect fluid plus a radial heat flow , @xmath17 were @xmath18 is the mass density , @xmath19 is the pressure , @xmath20 is the 4-velocity , @xmath21 is the heat - flux vector , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 obey the orthogonality condition @xmath24",
    ". then equations ( [ t00])-([t01 ] ) yield @xmath25 equations ( [ 4metr])-([heat ] ) constitute a complete set of the 4d solution , from which we see that the equation of state of the 4d fluid is @xmath26 , so it represents a radiation or extra - relativistic particles accompanied by a radial heat flow .",
    "the induced 4d energy - momentum tensor ( [ t - heat ] ) describes a thermodynamical system in which the radial heat current @xmath23 implies a radial temperature gradient .",
    "now we wish to calculate this temperature distribution over the fields . the generalized relativistic relation between heat current and temperature gradient",
    "can be found in refs.[11,12 ] with @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the coefficient of the thermal conductivity and @xmath29 is the projection tensor , @xmath30 to calculate equations ( [ q - t1 ] ) , we calculate @xmath31 firstly . with use of ( [ 4metr ] )",
    ", we find the only non - vanishing @xmath31 being @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , we assume @xmath33",
    ". then equations ( [ q - t1 ] ) reduce to @xmath34 and @xmath35 combining ( [ heat ] ) and ( [ q - t2 ] ) , we get @xmath36 we find that this equation can be integrated , giving an exact solution being @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant radius , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are values of @xmath10 and @xmath41 at @xmath42 , respectively . from ( [ heat ] ) we see that @xmath43 corresponds to thermal equilibrium @xmath44",
    ". then , from ( [ t - solu ] ) , if @xmath45 we get @xmath46constant .",
    "thus we recover the conclusion that thermal equilibrium corresponds not to constant temperature , but to the redshifted temperature distribution @xmath47constant.@xcite generally we have @xmath48 and the exact solution ( [ t - solu ] ) determines both the space distribution and the time variation of the temperature @xmath49 over the fields .",
    "the close - to - schwarzschild approximation of the solution ( [ 4metr ] ) was given in ref.[7 ] .",
    "we find that it can be re - expressed in the following form : @xmath50 \\quad ,   \\label{clos - to1 } \\\\ b & = & 1-\\frac{2gm}r+2\\lambda ^2r^2+o\\left ( \\varepsilon ^3\\right ) \\quad , \\label{clos - to2 } \\\\ a^{-1 } & = & 1-\\frac{2gm}r-\\lambda ^2r^2+o\\left ( \\varepsilon ^3\\right ) \\quad \\;. \\label{clos - to3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath51 is a small quantity of the order of the newtonian potential @xmath52 , @xmath53 are terms of the order of @xmath54 or higher , and we have assumed , for practical usage , that @xmath55 is also a small quantity of the order @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath56 to verify the accuracy of this solution , one can calculate @xmath57 and @xmath58 firstly , and then substitute them into the two equations ( [ bprime ] ) and ( [ aprime ] ) .",
    "thus the approximate solutions ( [ clos - to1])-([clos - to3 ] ) are correct in the range ( [ small ] ) , or , equivalently , in @xmath59 we also conclude that ( [ clos - to1])-([clos - to3 ] ) are accurate up to the second order of @xmath51 and give back to the schwarzschild solution if @xmath45 .",
    "so generally we can interpret the solution as an exterior solution of a star - like source .",
    "we will show , in the next section , that in a wide range in our solar system the condition ( [ small ] ) , or , equivalently , ( [ r - range ] ) , is satisfied .",
    "consider now the equation ( [ rho ] ) , which , by ( [ clos - to2 ] ) , reduces to @xmath60 \\quad .",
    "\\label{rho - appr}\\ ] ] here @xmath18 and @xmath19 constitute a perfect fluid with the equation of state @xmath26 , implying a property for radiation or ultra - relativistic particles . from ( [ rho - appr ] )",
    "we see that neglecting higher - order terms in the square bracket in the rhs of ( [ rho - appr ] ) , the densities @xmath18 and @xmath19 are homogenous and isotropic .",
    "thus we find that one can not interpret the fluid as a radiating atmosphere of a star such as in the vaidya metric.@xcite apparently , we can interpret it as to describe a star immersed in a homogenous and isotropic background radiation .",
    "the existence of the heat flow term in the energy - momentum tensor ( [ t - heat ] ) implies that there must be a temperature gradient in the field and a heat interchanges between the star and the background radiation .",
    "using ( [ clos - to2 ] ) and ( [ clos - to3 ] ) in ( [ t - solu ] ) gives @xmath61 \\quad .",
    "\\label{t - appr}\\ ] ] if we choose @xmath38 as the radius of the star , then in the exterior @xmath62 , equation ( [ t - appr ] ) implies that if @xmath63 then @xmath64 .",
    "be aware that the thermal equilibrium corresponds to @xmath65 for which there is no heat flow.@xcite so we conclude that the heat flows outwards if @xmath63 and inwards if @xmath66 .",
    "this agree with the original relation ( [ heat ] ) in which @xmath67 for @xmath63 and @xmath68 for @xmath66 since @xmath69 according to ( [ clos - to2 ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , from the metric ( [ clos - to1 ] ) and the result ( [ rho - appr ] ) we also see that if @xmath70 , then as the time @xmath71 increases , the 3d space contracts and the energy density of the outside fluid increases .",
    "all these properties are physically reasonable .",
    "as we have concluded in section 4 that the 4d solution discussed in this paper can be interpreted as an exterior solution of a spherical source such as a star which has a non - zero temperature and is immersed in a homogenous and isotropic background radiation . a natural candidate for this kind of radiation",
    "is the cosmic background radiation , for which the temperature is about @xmath72 at present days with an energy density around @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "thus , by using ( [ rho ] ) , we determine the constant @xmath5 as @xmath75 so @xmath5 is of the order of the hubble constant .",
    "now we wish to know if the close - to - schwarzschild solution given in ( [ clos - to1])-([clos - to3 ] ) can describe our solar system .",
    "that is , we need to calculate and compare orders of the two terms @xmath52 and @xmath76 appeared in ( [ clos - to2 ] ) and ( [ clos - to3 ] ) .",
    "the average distance between the sun and the nearest planet mercury is about @xmath77 au .",
    "so we have @xmath78 the average distance between the sun and the pluto is about @xmath79 au .",
    "so @xmath80 therefore we conclude that in a wide range in our solar system , we have @xmath81 .",
    "so @xmath76 is of the order higher than the post - newtonian order .",
    "this implies that the contributions of the cosmic background radiation to all of the known solar system experiments@xcite are negligible .",
    "however , there may have other ways to detect possible new effects of the solution .",
    "for example , according to the time - dependent metric ( [ clos - to1 ] ) and the value of @xmath5 in ( [ lambda ] ) , the radius of the central star should be contracting or expanding , depending on whether @xmath5 is positive or negative , with a relative rate at present time being @xmath82 it is worth to study whether this kind of effect is observable .",
