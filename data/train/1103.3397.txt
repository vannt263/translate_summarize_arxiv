    "in the last decade interdisciplinary research on complex networks resulted in spectacular development @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has become clear that networks constructed from diverse complex systems show remarkably similar features .",
    "several aspects were investigated , like clustering @xcite , the degree distribution@xcite , diameter @xcite , @xcite , spreading processes @xcite , diffusion @xcite , synchronization @xcite , critical phenomena @xcite and game theoretical models on complex networks @xcite .",
    "one of the most actively researched questions about complex networks is the one of community detection @xcite .",
    "community detection aims at finding dense groups in graphs , like circles of friends in social networks , web pages about the same topic , or substances appearing in the same pathway in metabolic reaction networks .",
    "perhaps the strongest motivation behind the research is that dense groups in the topology are expected to correspond to functions performed by the network , such that one can infer from pure topology to function .",
    "while the concept of communities seems intuitively plausible , attempts for an algorithmically useful definition have not been successful yet . the global characterization by modularity @xcite or by random walks @xcite , the local  weak  and  strong  definitions @xcite , the clique percolation approach @xcite , or the multiresolution methods @xcite",
    "have all increased out understanding of this complex problem but the proliferation of methods of community detection just indicates the difficulty of this issue @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , any precise definition of communities is still lacking , giving rise to innumerable methods using different definitions .",
    "lack of a definition also makes problematic the testing of methods ; although there is progress in this issue @xcite , @xcite .",
    "difficulty of the problem is increased by more subtle factors : very often communities occur on a broad scale , they can be ordered in a hierarchical manner , and they may overlap , which make their identification even harder .    after being the subject of active research for several years , it is getting clear that the following stages appear during community detection :    * defining the term `` community '' ; * finding the objects corresponding to the definition ; * determining the significance of the found communities .",
    "although from the theoretical perspective stage 1 is clearly a key issue , it is far from being settled .",
    "several different propositions exists , which are evaluated mostly according to their results on a few benchmarks .",
    "this is the stage to be improved in the first place in this paper .",
    "stage 2 is a technical issue , often consisting of some combinatorial optimization method .",
    "its choice is usually a result of a trade - off between speed and quality .",
    "stage 3 should give information about how surprising is the existence of a found community in the actual graph , given some characteristics of the graph like edge density or degree distribution .",
    "although this issue also got some attention @xcite-@xcite , it just began to get widespread application @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper will focus on the question of definition , so a few remarks about stage 3 are made here .",
    "most community detection methods give no information about the significance of their output , thus forcing the investigator to assume that all results are ( equally ) significant .",
    "this way , the community detection stages 2 and 3 are combined into a single decision whether a particular subgraph is a good enough community or not  effectively pruning the significance test in practice .",
    "the other end of the spectrum , represented by @xcite , builds the definition of communities on statistical significance , which is clearly an improvement .",
    "however , it should be noted that the fitness and statistical significance of a subgraph as a community are not synonyms .",
    "statistical significance tells us how surprising a subgraph is , while fitness talks about how close is it to the ideal community .",
    "therefore , the two quantities are complementary and both belong to the description of a community .",
    "a fundamental problem of community detection is to define the term `` community '' .",
    "there are different approaches to this question .",
    "one is the algorithmic approach , giving a computational procedure for finding clusters .",
    "this naturally incorporates a mathematically precise definition , although different algorithms usually result in diverse definitions , and there is no theoretical framework currently to help their differentiation . another possibility is to present a general concept , on which a precise definition can be based . in this paper ,",
    "the latter approach is taken , although an algorithmic realization is also presented .",
    "no definition of communities which is both precise and generally accepted has appeared yet .",
    "currently the description of communities exhausts in the phrase `` nodes having more edges among themselves than to the rest of the graph '' ( or equivalent forms ) .",
    "it can be translated roughly to  statistically significant locally dense subgraphs  .",
    "statistical significance is a quite precise expression , the main problem is with the term  locally dense  .",
    "for an intuitive picture , it is quite good , but much less than directly transformable to algorithms .",
    "although there is an implicit agreement on that clearly counterintuitive results are not permitted , even a formal list of required properties is missing .",
    "however , there are some properties which fit human intuition about locally dense subgraphs :    separation : : :    a good community is well - separated from the rest of the graph ; cohesion : : :    a good community is homogeneously well connected inside , i.e. it is    hard to separate into two communities .",
    "the separation criterion is quite clear , although there is an important remark : separation should be defined locally , involving only the community under investigation and its immediate neighborhood .",
    "global methods , in which distant regions of the graph can modify a community in order to improve a global fitness value , can produce results violating the human perception about clusters .",
    "a famous example is the resolution limit of modularity @xcite .",
    "although separation is a very intuitive criterion , and famous methods rely on it ( see the appendix ) , it is not enough in itself . figs .",
    "[ fig:2cliques]-[fig : sw_2cliques ] illustrate that the distribution of links inside the separated region ( the  shape  of the subgraph ) also matters heavily .",
    "application of current community detection methods to real - world networks confirms that this is a real problem , e.g. tree - like communities can occur , even when the whole network is not tree - like @xcite , @xcite .",
    "both separation and cohesion are required properties of communities .",
    "if one neglects cohesion , the result may contain clusters like the one on fig .",
    "[ fig:2cliques ] . on the other hand ,",
    "if separation is not taken into account , one may end up chopping a separated subgraph until very cohesive pieces ( cliques in the extreme ) are obtained , like the triangles on fig .",
    "[ fig : sw_2cliques ] .",
    "+    given the subgraphs on figs [ fig:2cliques ] and [ fig : sw_2cliques ] as proposed communities , most community detection methods fitness values , to be reviewed in the next section , can not tell the difference between them .",
    "this is due to that most methods simply count the internal and/or external edges , which do not tell about the distribution of those edges .",
    "the reason why several methods do not fail to assign proper clusters for fig [ fig:2cliques ] is that they look for optimal clusters , consequently they compare configurations like fig [ fig:2cliques ] in one cluster and in two clusters , and splitting the two cliques into two clusters may improve the partition .",
    "but the situation is even worse . in the next section",
    ", we will see that a number of fitness functions are more optimal for a counterintuitive clustering than for the intuitive one ( e.g. joining the two cliques on fig [ fig:2cliques ] , like modularity for a large enough graph ) .",
    "it should be noted that in such a case , the proper communities might be recovered if the heuristic gets stuck in the proper local optimum , even when that is not the global optimum .",
    "here , existing community detection methods will be reviewed from the point of view of the previous section , i.e. do they conform the criterions of separation and cohesion . as mini - benchmarks , the examples on fig .",
    "[ fig : counterexample ] or their simple variations will be used ( see the appendix for details on individual methods ) .",
    "the desired output for [ fig:2cliques ] is two communities consisting of the two cliques , while [ fig : sw_2cliques ] should be kept in one piece . in both cases , no nodes from the rest of the graph",
    "should be included . for methods optimizing a fitness function ,",
    "the globally optimal solution will be considered , for other methods , the possible solutions .",
    "these solutions will be compared to the desired ones , independently for fig .",
    "[ fig:2cliques ] and [ fig : sw_2cliques ] .",
    "if a method separates the two cliques of fig .",
    "[ fig:2cliques ] , then it gets a `` + '' , if it puts all nodes of fig . [",
    "fig : sw_2cliques ] into one cluster , then it gets another `` + '' .",
    "if there are multiple equally valid solutions ( like for label propagation ) , all solutions are required to conform the preferred result .",
    "+ for methods optimizing a function , the heuristic realizing the optimization may deviate from the global optimum , presenting worse or even better results ( in terms of conformity to separation and cohesion ) .",
    "this will not be investigated , here the focus is on the definition of the communities ( following from the choice of the fitness function ) , not on the practical aspects .",
    "results for methods which can produce a single partition or cover are displayed in table [ t : review ] .",
    "the large number of published methods makes assembling a complete list nearly impossible .",
    "instead , the emphasis is put on the diversity of the reviewed approaches .",
    ".cohesion & separation criterion test results .",
    "tests were done on fig .",
    "[ fig:2cliques ] and [ fig : sw_2cliques ] or similar graphs ( which are described in the appendix ) . + and",
    "- are assigned according to whether the fitness function of a method is more optimal for the preferred solution or not . for methods which do not optimize a fitness function , simply the possible solution(s )",
    "was ( were ) analyzed .",
    "see the appendix for details on specific methods . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     there is a bunch of multiresolution methods , which possess a parameter allowing to tune the cluster sizes from @xmath0 ( isolated nodes ) to @xmath1 : the multiresolution modularity of reichardt and bornholdt ( rb ) @xcite , of arenas , fernndez and gmez ( afg ) @xcite , the local fitness method of lancichinetti , fortunato and kertsz ( lfk ) @xcite , the potts model of ronhovde and nussinov ( rn ) @xcite , the markov autocovariance stability of delvenne , yaliraki and barahona ( mas ) @xcite , the hierarchical likelihood method of clauset , moore and newman ( cnm ) @xcite , and the markov cluster algorithm of van dongen ( mcl ) @xcite .",
    "naturally , these methods are expected to find the proper community assignments both to fig .",
    "[ fig:2cliques ] and [ fig : sw_2cliques ] at some parameter values . however , there is no guarantee that these values are also the proper ones for the rest of the graph .",
    "consequently , it is not clear how a resolution parameter should be set : the natural idea is to find the longest interval of the resolution parameter value in which the community structure does not change , but when the optimal parameter value is different for different regions in the graph , the longest stable interval not necessarily reflects the optimal communities .",
    "+ furthermore , the fitness values do not help us to tell good clusters from bad ones , like fig .",
    "[ fig:2cliques ] from fig .",
    "[ fig : sw_2cliques ] . for most multiresolution methods ( rb , afg , lfk , rn ) ,",
    "it is very easy to see that the fitnesses of two clusters are the same given that all nodes has the same in- and outdegrees , independently of the shape of the clusters .",
    "note that it is also true for most single resolution methods .",
    "for mas it is not trivial .",
    "therefore , empirical tests were conducted to check it . according to them , fig .",
    "[ fig:2cliques ] was found empirically to be at least as good as [ fig : sw_2cliques ] edges .",
    "stability values were calculated from @xmath2 to 100 , the step size being @xmath2 below @xmath3 and 1 above .",
    "] . finally , regarding mcl and cnm , they have no fitness function , the only accessible quantity about the community structure is the parameter interval in which it is stable .",
    "finally , there are hierarchical methods , which look for series of smaller and smaller ( or larger and larger ) clusters hierarchically embedded into the previous ones . similarly to multiresolution methods , they are expected to contain good clusters in the outputted hierarchy . however , when looking at a graph having a simple one - level community structure , the question how to select the proper levels of the outputted hierarchy arises .",
    "the easiest way is to use the lowest level communities .",
    "unfortunately , it is not a reliable procedure , as the lowest - level clusters may be just parts of the communities of the optimal partition or cover ( see the appendix for details ) . a second idea can be to assign significance scores to the communities on different levels , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "although this approach might reliably qualify the found communities , a new version of statistical significance taking into account the internal cohesion is required .",
    "furthermore , one should be very careful not to impose unnecessary constraints , like prohibiting overlaps , when constructing a hierarchical method .",
    "a further question is whether a method provides information about the shape of the found communities or not .",
    "recent analysis of real - world networks highlights the relevance of this issue @xcite , @xcite .",
    "several methods are based on simply counting the internal and/or external edges , or degrees at most : lfk , labelpropagation , infomap , modularity optimization ( and equivalents ) , hofman & wiggins , hastings , ronhovde & nussinov , newman & leicht , wang & lai , bickel & chen , karrer & newman , infomod , ahn et al .",
    "consequently , they do not see any difference in the distribution of the links , e.g. fig [ fig:2cliques ] and [ fig : sw_2cliques ] get the same fitness values .",
    "only clique percolation and radicchi et al.s method have some very limited requirement about cohesion built in the definition of communities .",
    "the conclusion is that none of the reviewed methods is able to successfully apply both the separation and the cohesion criterions .",
    "they susceptible either to glue together well - separated subgraphs or to overpartition a cohesive subgraph .",
    "future network designs should consider cohesion as well as separation .",
    "in this section , a new method for community detection is introduced .",
    "its main goal is to present a method which takes into account both criterions defined in sec .",
    "[ s : def ] .",
    "first , the lfk method will be reviewed , which will serve as a starting point for the new method .",
    "then , a composite fitness will be constructed which takes into account the separation and cohesion criterions .",
    "finally , a heuristic optimization procedure for the composite fitness will be described , which finds locally dense subgraphs on all scales , and also able to recover hierarchical structures .      the lfk method @xcite optimizes the local fitness function @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes a subgraph , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the total number of inside and outside degrees in @xmath5 , respectively , and @xmath8 is a tunable exponent for setting the size scale of the communities to be found .",
    "running the method with large @xmath8 values result in small clusters , small values in large clusters .",
    "the recommended range for @xmath8 is @xmath9-@xmath10 .    the practical implementation of the optimization works as follows .",
    "the communities are found one - by - one , independently of each other .",
    "first , a seed node is selected from which the new community will be grown .",
    "then , the node which can best improve the fitness of the cluster is added .",
    "this addition is repeated until the fitness reaches a local optimum .",
    "after each addition , removal of nodes takes place , if the fitness can be enhanced that way . when the fitness can not be further increased , the actual subgraph is declared a community .",
    "the growth process is repeated for all nodes as seeds , or alternatively , until the found communities cover all nodes in the graph .",
    "although the resolution parameter @xmath8 can be tuned continuously , @xcite suggested that the relevant community structures should be identified by robustness to changes in @xmath8 , i.e. which have the longest interval for @xmath8 values without change .",
    "changes in the community structure were detected by monitoring the mean fitness of the communities , evaluated at a reference value @xmath11 .",
    "for the separation criterion , the following function will be applied @xmath12 where @xmath5 is a subgraph , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the sums of in - community and out - community degrees , respectively .",
    "this is the fitness of lfk @xcite , with the multiresolution parameter being set to one . for detecting hierarchical structures ,",
    "a different solution will be described .",
    "[ e : f_s ] clearly focuses on the external separation of the clusters , therefore it is suitable as an implementation of the first criterion of the communities .    for the internal cohesion criterion , a possible solution is to consider the second eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix of the community .",
    "the laplacian of a graph is the matrix @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the adjacency ( or weight ) matrix , and @xmath17 is a diagonal matrix containing the degrees ( strengths ) .",
    "its largest eigenvalue is always 0 ( corresponding to the trivial eigenvector @xmath18 ) .",
    "the multiplicity of the largest eigenvalue equals to the number of connected components in the graph .",
    "this gives the hint that if two distinct graphs are got connected by a single ( weak ) link , the laplacian gets only a slight perturbation ( compared to the case of two connected components ) , which splits the double degeneracy of the first eigenvalue , such that a new eigenvalue close to zero appears .",
    "in fact , it is known that the second eigenvalue of the laplacian measures `` how difficult is to split the graph into two large pieces '' @xcite .",
    "for some important special cases the second eigenvalue can be calculated :    * for full graphs of @xmath19 nodes ( clique ) , @xmath20 * for a star - graph , @xmath21 , independently of @xmath19 * for a linear chain , @xmath22 as @xmath23 * for two @xmath19-sized cliques attached by a single link ( having weight @xmath24 ) ( like on fig . [ fig:2cliques ] ) , @xmath25 , which also goes to 0 as @xmath23 . * for a disconnected graph , @xmath26 .",
    "this may seem trivial , but most methods give a finite score for disconnected communities ; it is not without precedent that such objects can be produced in reality @xcite .",
    "although this problem can be avoided by a properly designed heuristic of a method , disconnected communities should be punished by definition .",
    "calculation for the two cliques is in the appendix , other results can be found in @xcite .",
    "these cases confirm that the second eigenvalue is useful for quantifying the cohesion criterion of the definition of communities .",
    "for an illustration , on fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda2_series ] a few example graphs with their second laplacian eigenvalues are shown .",
    "+    the separation fitness term @xmath27 ranges from zero to one . in order to compose it together with the cohesion fitness",
    ", the latter should also be in the interval @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath29 needs some transformations before application as fitness . + as can be seen from the above examples , for the worst cases @xmath30 is of the order of @xmath31 , therefore the lowest point of the @xmath30-scale will be set to @xmath31 .",
    "the highest point is trivially given by @xmath19 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that most subgraphs have @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , several subgraphs can have worse internal cohesion than the star graph , thus having @xmath33 $ ] . to take into account these effect",
    ", @xmath34 will be more useful than @xmath29 .",
    "so , in order to obtain a quantity between 0 and 1 , the minimum will be subtracted and divided by the maximum , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of nodes in the community .",
    "the above measure happens to be @xmath9 if @xmath29 is 1 , e.g. for the star - graph .",
    "i wish to emphasize that eq .",
    "[ eq : lambda2 ] is only one possible proposition for taking into account the internal cohesion , although a promising one  better measures may exist .",
    "the same is true for the choice of @xmath37 .",
    "the cohesion fitness @xmath38 opens the way for constructing tests assessing the performance of community detection methods regarding the cohesion of the found communities .",
    "one may generate a graph with built - in communities which separation is controlled , like in the lfr benchmark @xcite , then randomly select pairs of clusters and increase the interconnection between the two members of each pairs to some predefined value , finally calculating @xmath38 of the pairs . running the detection method and measuring the ratio of pairs not split as a function of @xmath38",
    "may indicate how strongly focuses the method on cohesion .",
    "the next question is how to combine @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "thinking in a two dimensional space of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , a natural approach is to get as far from the point @xmath43 as possible .",
    "this implies @xmath44 so the fitness is the euclidean distance from @xmath43 .",
    "again , this is just one possibility , better combinations may exist . e.g. the relative weight of @xmath37 and @xmath45 may be adjusted in a more well - grounded way .",
    "however , eq . [ e : fullfitness ] is able to pass the test raised by fig . [",
    "fig : counterexample ] : for fig .",
    "[ fig:2cliques ] , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 while for a single clique @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 . for fig .",
    "[ fig : sw_2cliques ] , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and for the best subgraph , a triangle , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .    beyond enabling one to decide whether a given subgraph is a community or not ( by requiring local optimality ) , the above definition makes it possible to assess how good community it is .",
    "this is also possible with another definitions , e.g. by using the modularity function , but here , communities are placed on a 2-dimensional space instead of 1 dimension .",
    "this gives rise to an interesting possibility for characterizing the communities , like `` very cohesive but densely connected outwards '' or `` well - separated but poorly interconnected '' . considering fig .",
    "[ fig:2cliques ] , one may think that the latter is not really a community .",
    "but for large subgraphs , it may make sense to consider a well - separated subgraph as a community , as common sense says that large communities should be looser than small ones .      in this section ,",
    "the details of practical implementation of the new method are discussed .",
    "most importantly , in order to actually find the communities , a heuristic carrying out the optimization of eq .",
    "[ e : fullfitness ] is needed .",
    "furthermore , there is a second problem of detecting communities hierarchically embedded into each other .",
    "these two questions will be answered by a common solution .",
    "the heuristic is based on the one of the lfk method @xcite . among its details",
    ", the lfk heuristic contains a tunable parameter ( denoted as @xmath8 ) , which is claimed to be able to recover communities at different hierarchical levels . lowering this parameter @xmath8 results in increased community sizes .",
    "hierarchical levels are supposed to be stable against the variation of @xmath8 , so there should be long intervals for @xmath8 for which the communities do not change .",
    "however , large graphs may lack long stable intervals , as some changes occur around any parameter value ( data not shown ) .",
    "therefore , a new method for investigating hierarchical structure is needed .",
    "i dropped the idea of using threshold values of @xmath8 , corresponding to community structures at different scales , which should be simultaneously valid for all communities , and i will treat each community separately .    similarly",
    "to @xcite , each community is grown from a seed node .",
    "it is important to note that each seed node can result in a series of ( successively larger ) communities .",
    "growth consists of successively including the neighboring node which increases most the fitness defined by eq .",
    "[ e : fullfitness ] .",
    "when there is no neighboring node which inclusion can improve the fitness , the stage of node removal begins . here ,",
    "the fitness of the cluster is tried to be improved by excluding nodes from it ( with the exception of the seed node , which is not permitted to be excluded ) .",
    "it finishes when no further removal can improve the fitness .",
    "then , growth begins again , if possible .",
    "the grow - shrink cycle is iterated , as long as the fitness can be improved .",
    "when no improvement is possible ( there is a local optimum of the fitness ) , the actual list of nodes is registered as a valid community . after that , the algorithm tries to find a larger community , which contains the current one . this way , hierarchical structures can be revealed .",
    "in order to do it , first the growing cluster should escape from the basin of attraction of the current local optimum .",
    "therefore , the cluster is forced to grow , by successively including the neighboring nodes which decrease the fitness the least .",
    "after some steps of forced growth , when increasing the fitness becomes again possible , the algorithm turns back to the normal grow - shrink procedure , until a new local optimum is found , signing a new community .",
    "the cluster keeps hopping from local optimum to another local optimum until it grows so large that it contains the whole graph .",
    "then a new growth process starts from a new seed node . at the end of its growth process",
    ", it includes the whole graph again , unless it encounters a local optimum which has been already found , i.e. the corresponding community has already been registered . in this case , the growth process is stopped . then , another growth process starts from a not - yet - used seed node .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , all nodes in the graph are used as seed nodes , in order not to miss good communities . when the growth process beginning from the last seed node finishes , the algorithm ends , and the registered communities are written to the output .",
    "+ there are a few additional tricks .",
    "first , if escaping from a local optimum seems to be hard , i.e. after changing from forced growth to the normal grow - shrink stage we still end up in the previous local optimum , the cluster is restored to the state where it had its maximal size ( the beginning of one of the removal sessions ) , then 2 steps of forced growth is applied before the normal grow - shrink cycle begins .",
    "a second trick is that when judging the identity of two communities , they are considered identical if at least @xmath58 of the larger community is a subset of the smaller one . in case of identity , the community which has the higher fitness is kept in the registry .",
    "+ the algorithm , although based on the one of @xcite , differs in several points : from one seed , several communities can be reached instead of only the smallest one ; node removal occurs when node addition is not possible instead of after each addition ( this trick also speeds up the algorithm ) ; seed node is not permitted to be removed ; all nodes are used as seeds instead of the not - yet - covered nodes .",
    "an algorithm similar in spirit was described in @xcite .",
    "the results in the next section are obtained using this method , unless stated otherwise explicitly .",
    "the software realizing the algorithm is available at + ` http://www.phy.bme.hu/~tibelyg/ ` .",
    "probably the most frequently used test is zachary s karate club friendship network@xcite . due to a dispute between two prominent persons ( node 1 and 34 ) , the club split into two during sociological observation , and the memberships in the new clubs",
    "are known . as the split occurred more or less along a border of two visible communities , new community detection algorithms",
    "are usually claimed to pass the test if they reproduce the split .",
    "however , the aim is the detection of _ topological _ modules , not functional ones , so the result of the sociological study is not a strict criterion for judging the output of any community detection method .",
    "e.g. , node 10 has @xmath59 links to each of the new clubs , so `` misplacing '' it ( compared to the split ) may not be considered as a fault . or node 12 , which attaches only to node 1 , is hard to be considered as part of a `` densely interconnected '' cluster . +",
    "the algorithm finds @xmath60 groups , containing several non - relevant ones , like pairs of nodes .",
    "therefore , a filtering procedure is required .",
    "the statistical significance of the resulting communities @xcite is utilized for this purpose .",
    "the statistical significance can be sensitive for missing nodes @xcite , therefore each cluster is allowed to be completed with the neighboring node which optimizes the statistical significance .",
    "then the clusters are ordered according to their statistical significance .",
    "the first 3 clusters provide a single - level community structure , corresponding to 3 known communities , with 2 overlapping and 1 homeless nodes ( fig .",

    "this phenomenon , although not being a huge surprise , raises the question how to judge precisely a community detection method s output at large mixing ratios , as the known community structure may not be trusted to 100% .",
    "an important aspect of all community detection methods is the _ running time_. in the case of the new method described above , the time requirement is as follows . starting a new community from each node contributes a factor of @xmath66 to the cpu time . evaluating the eigenvalues of a community @xmath5 plus",

    "@xcite and slepc @xcite were tried .",
    "the experience was that  despite their good asymptotic performance in the large matrix limit  for the occurring several small subgraphs the overhead of these complicated machineries was so large that made the final running time much higher than those obtained with the qr - decomposition algorithm .",

    ". furthermore , the current form of statistical significance accounts only for the separation of the community , not for its internal cohesion .",
