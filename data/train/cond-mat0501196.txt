    "the far - from - equilibrium evolution of the system from the unstable homogeneous state to the segregated state has received considerable attention @xcite .",
    "this evolution is characterized by the emergence and growth of domains enriched in the components a and b. the terms used to describe this nonequilibrium process are _ phase ordering dynamics _ , _ domain growth _ or _ coarsening_. a quantitative characterization of phase ordering systems focuses on ( a ) the domain growth law ; ( b ) the statistical properties of the evolution morphology ; and ( c ) the temporal correlation of pattern dynamics .",
    "the equilibrium phase - separated state is uniquely determined by its thermodynamic properties .",
    "however , there is a diverse range of kinetic pathways which enable segregation .",
    "for example , phase separation in alloys is usually driven by vacancy - mediated diffusion @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for fluid mixtures , hydrodynamic velocity fields enable convective transport of material along domain boundaries and give rise to novel asymptotic behaviors @xcite .",

    "the standard model for binary mixtures is the ising model : [ ham ] h= -j_ij _ i _ j , _",

    "the states @xmath3 or @xmath4 denote the presence of an a - atom or b - atom at site @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we consider the case with ferromagnetic ( @xmath6 ) nearest - neighbor interactions , denoted by the subscript @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) .",
    "the phase diagram for the binary mixture is obtained in an ensemble with fixed temperature @xmath8 and magnetization @xmath9 .",
    "the ising system does not have an intrinsic dynamics as the poisson brackets ( or commutators ) of spin variables are identically zero .",
    "therefore , one introduces stochastic kinetics by placing the system in contact with a heat - bath which induces fluctuations . the ising model , in conjunction with a physically appropriate spin kinetics , is referred to as a _ kinetic ising model _ @xcite .",
    "an important example is the kawasaki spin - exchange model @xcite , which has nearest - neighbor spin exchanges with metropolis acceptance probabilities . in an mc simulation of this model ,",
    "a pair of nearest - neighbor sites @xmath5 and @xmath10 is randomly selected , and the spins @xmath11 and @xmath12 are exchanged . the probability that this exchange is accepted",

    "the phase - separation kinetics in this microscopic model is analogous to that for the coarse - grained cahn - hilliard - cook ( chc ) equation , which is obtained as follows : [ chc ] ( , t ) & = & - ( , t ) + & = & + & = & . here",

    "the chemical potential is obtained as a functional derivative of the helmholtz free energy , which is often taken to have the @xmath26-form : [ psi4 ] f [ ] & = & h - ts + & & d , where we have identified @xmath27 in eq .",

    "the chc equation is also known as _ model b _ in the hohenberg - halperin classification scheme for critical dynamics @xcite .",
    "further , using a master - equation approach , the chc equation can be motivated from the spin - exchange model @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will subsequently refer to the kawasaki model as `` model b '' .    before proceeding",
    ", we stress that the general form of the chc equation contains an order - parameter - dependent mobility @xcite : [ opm ] d ( ) = d_0 ( 1 - ) , where @xmath30 is the saturation value of the order parameter at @xmath31 .",
    "this is not consequential for quenches to moderate temperatures , but plays an important role for deep quenches where @xmath32 in bulk domains . in that case , bulk diffusion is effectively eliminated and domain growth proceeds by surface diffusion @xcite . in the context of the kawasaki model , this can be understood by focusing on an interfacial pair with the minimum barrier for interchange : @xmath3 at the periphery of an up - rich domain and having only one neighbor with the same spin value , and @xmath33 in a down - rich domain . at low temperatures ,",
    "the bulk domains are very pure and the energy barrier to the interchange @xmath34 is @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the time - scale for this interchange @xmath36 as @xmath37 , effectively blocking bulk diffusion .",
    "of course , once an impurity spin is placed inside a bulk domain , there is no further barrier to its diffusion .",
    "apart from this natural blocking of bulk diffusion at @xmath31 , there are systems where the bulk mobility diminishes drastically due to physical processes , e.g. , one or both of the components may undergo a glass @xcite or gelation @xcite transition . at the phenomenological level",
    ", this has been modeled by setting the mobility to zero in regions rich in the glass - phase or gel - phase . at the microscopic level , we propose a kinetic ising model where bulk diffusion is suppressed by introducing a kinetic constraint .",
    "we disallow exchanges @xmath34 if the neighboring spins of the pair are all parallel , even though such an exchange would not raise the energy . in this case ,",
    "segregation is driven primarily by diffusion along domain boundaries , though some bulk transport occurs via impurity @xmath38-spin clusters .",
    "( this bulk diffusion is negligible for moderate to deep quenches . )",
    "we will subsequently refer to this model as `` model s '' @xcite .",
    "clearly , model s can be generalized to the case of reduced ( though non - zero ) mobility in the bulk domains .",
    "this is done by allowing spin - exchanges with different time - scales depending on the number and type of parallel neighbors for a spin pair .",
    "all our mc simulations were performed on an @xmath39 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions . at time @xmath40 , the temperature was quenched from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the critical temperature of the @xmath44 ising model .",

    "our mc simulations exploit the technique of _ multi - spin coding_. for a general introduction to this technique , see ref .",
    "the basic idea is that one can exploit the 64-bit computer architecture to undertake a parallel simulation of 64 systems .",

    "recall that , in one elementary move for model b , we propose to exchange the spins located on nearest - neighbor sites @xmath5 and @xmath10 . for model",
    "s , we impose the kinetic constraint that a pair of spins surrounded by aligned neighbors is not exchanged .    for the @xmath44 square lattice considered here , each site has four nearest - neighbors .",

    "it is more convenient to determine the logical variables @xmath62 which tell whether @xmath11 is antiparallel to at least @xmath63 of its neighbors ( other than @xmath12 ) .",

    "finally , the acceptance probability for the proposed spin exchanges is obtained by using _ random bit patterns _ @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "these 36 operations for model s ( or 30 for model b ) act on all 64 bits and thus perform 64 elementary moves . in conjunction with the required _ load _ and _ store _ operations , and generation of the random bit patterns , our implementation of model b for a @xmath73 system with multi - spin coding requires 4.6 ns cpu - time per elementary move on an amd-64 computer with 3 ghz clock frequency . this should be contrasted with a direct implementation of this model , which requires approximately 100 ns cpu - time per elementary move on the same machine .",

    ", coarsening occurs only through the systematic motion of interfaces and the system always reduces its energy .",
    "however , the @xmath31 limit is not interesting in the context of kinetic ising models because the evolving system invariably gets trapped in local free - energy minima .",
    "+ ( c ) in recent work , puri and kumar @xcite have studied the decorrelation process in a spin-1 model using a stochastic model based on the continuous - time random walk formalism .",
    "we are currently trying to adapt their modeling to understand the behavior in fig .",
    "let us conclude this paper with a summary and discussion of the results presented here .",
    "we have studied phase separation in a kinetic ising model for phase separation mediated by surface diffusion .",
    "this model ( referred to as model s ) is obtained by imposing a kinetic constraint on the usual kawasaki kinetic ising model ( referred to as model b ) .",
    "in general , the surface diffusion mechanism can drive segregation only when the morphology consists of percolated clusters , i.e. , for near - critical quenches .",
    "we have undertaken monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of models b and s using multi - spin coding techniques .",
    "these provide accelerated algorithms which enable the simulation of large systems for extended times .",
    "our results show that the major difference between the morphologies of models b and s lies in the growth dynamics . in this regard , it is relevant to emphasize the following : + ( a ) the early - time dynamics ( @xmath158 ) of model b is also dominated by surface diffusion with the growth law @xmath82 . for late times ( @xmath159 ) , there is a crossover to the @xmath83-growth regime . in the limit of @xmath37 ,",
    "the crossover time diverges ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "however , the low - temperature dynamics of model b usually freezes into metastable states .",
    "therefore , it is hard to see an extended regime of @xmath115-growth in model b. + ( b ) our kinetic constraint eliminates single - particle bulk diffusion , and we see extended regimes of growth driven by surface diffusion .",
    "however , @xmath38-particle diffusion ( with @xmath161 ) is still possible and is governed by the probability for existence of impurities in bulk domains .",
    "thus , at sufficiently large times ( @xmath162 ) , we again expect a crossover to @xmath83-growth . however , this crossover is extremely delayed , even at moderate temperatures .",
    "+ ( c ) we have also studied kinetic models with constraints which eliminate the diffusion of @xmath38-spin clusters .",
    "the domain growth data obtained from these models is numerically indistinguishable from that for model s. + ( d ) for highly off - critical quenches , the morphology consists of droplets of the minority phase in a matrix of the majority phase . in this case , the surface diffusion mechanism can not drive phase separation .",
    "however , brownian motion and coalescence of droplets also gives rise to @xmath115-growth in @xmath44 .",
    "apart from growth laws , we have also studied quantitative properties of the evolution morphology like correlation functions and island - size distribution functions .",
    "there are subtle differences in the scaled correlation functions for models b and s , but it is difficult to attribute physical significance to these .",
    "further , these differences are not reflected in the island - size distribution function .",
    "finally , we have studied the aging of the autocorrelation function @xmath147 in models b and s. in both cases , we find that the decorrelation process is driven by both fluctuations and domain - wall motion .",
    "thus , @xmath147 does not exhibit a simple power - law decay or scaling behavior .",
    "we are presently adapting the continuous - time random walk approach developed by puri and kumar @xcite to study the aging of the autocorrelation functions in models b and s."
