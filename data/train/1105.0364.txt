    "in the standard model  ( sm ) , the flavor - changing neutral current  ( fcnc ) interactions , which are absent at the tree level , are highly suppressed at one loop due to the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani  ( gim ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "possible new physics  ( np ) beyond the sm can manifest itself by altering the expected rates of these fcnc processes .",
    "thus , the study of fcnc interactions plays an important role in testing the sm and probing np beyond it .    for the top quark in particular",

    "any positive signal of these decays would imply np beyond the sm .",
    "these top - quark anomalous couplings could also be probed by studying the top quark production  @xcite .",

    "@xcite collaborations have presented their sensitivity to these rare top - quark decays induced by anomalous fcnc interactions , and will be able to observe @xmath31 decays if their branching ratios could be enhanced to @xmath32 with @xmath13 data .",
