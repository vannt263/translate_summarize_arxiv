    "entanglement is one of the fundamental properties of quantum information theory , where it has been considered as a nonclassical resource for many applications as quantum teleportation @xcite and super dense coding @xcite . to achieve these tasks with high efficiency",
    "one needs maximum entangled states and perfect local operations , which are very difficult to be established in the real word .",
    "therefore , investigating the dynamics of entanglement in the presence of imperfect circumstance is very important in the context of quantum information processing .",
    "for example , the dynamics of multiparities entanglement under the influence of decoherence is investigated in @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of entangled atoms interact with a deformed cavity mode is investigated by metwally @xcite .",
    "coherent states play important roles in many fields of physics , specially in quantum technologies and quantum optics @xcite .",
    "for example , two entangled coherent states are used to realize an effective quantum computation@xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "allati and et al @xcite have suggested a system of three modes coherent state and used it to perform quantum teleportation .",
    "communication via entangled coherent quantum network is investigated in @xcite , where it is shown that the probability of performing successful teleportation through this network depends on its size .",
    "entanglement properties of an optical coherent entangled state consists of two entangled modes under amplitude damping channel is discussed by wickrt@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the ghz state through the amplitude damping channel is investigated by konrad et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to investigate the entanglement properties of a class of maximum entangled coherent states consist of three modes pass through a damping channel .",
    "also , we study the dynamics of a multi - entangled coherent state passes through this noise channel . the effect of this channel equivalence to a photon absorption followed by a phase flip operator .",
    "the suppressing of the travelling state over this channel is discussed , where we quantified the bound entanglement of the output state as well as the survival amount of entanglement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.2 , we review the suggested entangled muti - modes coherent state , mmcs the amount of entanglement over a perfect environment is quantified @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of the mmcs over an amplitude damping channel is investigated in sec.3 , where we quantify the bound of entanglement for a maximum entangled state consists of three modes .",

    "finally , we summarize our results in sec.4 .",
    "entangled coherent states have been proposed as an important resource in quantum information processing , ensuring or teleporting an unknown quantum states .",
    "these sates can be written as function of the fock state @xcite as , @xmath4 the coherent state can be generated from the vacuum state @xmath5 , by the displacement operator @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are bosons creation and annihilation operators respectively . among of the properties of these states",
    "is the non - orthogonality , and the overlap of two coherent states @xmath9 is @xmath10 which becomes orthogonal by increasing the amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "two coherent states can be used as basis states of a logical qubit where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "one form of the entangled coherent states between three modes can be written as ,     and @xmath14 , with @xmath15.,title=\"fig:\"](-178,25)@xmath16 ( -225,80)@xmath17    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the normalization factor . if we set @xmath20 in ( [ channel ] ) , one obtains a maximum entangled state defined by , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the normalization factor .",

    "it is clear that , at @xmath20 the concurrence @xmath26 namely the entanglement is maximum and is independent of @xmath11 . however the concurrence is less than 1 ebit for the small amplitude , but it increases to one ebit for larger amplitudes . therefore , this state represents two classes of entangled coherent states : the first is partial entangled states and the second is maximum entangled one ( see @xcite for more details ) .",

    "@xmath47 $ ] , @xmath38 increases faster and reaches its maximum value ( @xmath48 as the noise strength increases .",
    "however , for larger values of the field intensity the dynamics of @xmath38 is independent of the noise strength , where @xmath49 .",
    "this means that for larger values of the transmissivity rate @xmath50 , the travelling state is almost maximum and its resistance to phase flip error is stronger .      to investigate the entanglement of a maximum entangled tripartite state ( which is defined by ( [ max ] ) ) , passes through amplitude damping channel",
    ", we consider the following situation : let us assume that we have a source supplies a three users , alice , bob and charlie with a maximum entangled state of type ( [ max ] ) . for simplicity , it is assumed that during the transition from the source to the users , bob and charlie s qubit are forced to pass through amplitude damping channel . according to this suggested scenario , the dynamics of the travelling state",

    "then the output state vector can be written as ,    @xmath60    the lower bound of entanglement of state @xmath61 can be quantified by using a procedure described in @xcite .",
