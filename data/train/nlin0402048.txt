    "in this article , the problem we address is how to control chaos in hamiltonian systems which are close to integrable .",
    "we consider the class of hamiltonian systems that can be written in the form @xmath1 that is an integrable hamiltonian @xmath2 ( with action - angle variables ) plus a small perturbation @xmath3 .",
    "+ the problem of control in hamiltonian systems is the following one : for the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath4 , the aim is to devise a control term @xmath5 such that the dynamics of the controlled hamiltonian @xmath6 has more regular trajectories ( e.g.  on invariant tori ) or less diffusion than the uncontrolled one . in practice , we do not require that the controlled hamiltonian is integrable , but only that it has a more regular behavior than the original system .",
    "this allows us to tailor the control term following specific requirements .",
    "+ obviously @xmath7 is a solution since the resulting hamiltonian is integrable .",
    "however , it is a useless solution since the control is of the same order as the perturbation . + for practical purposes , the desired control term should be small ( with respect to the perturbation @xmath3 ) , localized in phase space ( meaning that the subset of phase space where @xmath5 is non - zero is finite or small enough ) , or @xmath5 should be of a specific shape ( e.g. a sum of given fourier modes , or with a certain regularity ) .",
    "moreover , the control should be as simple as possible in order to be implemented in experiments .",
    "therefore , the control appears to be a trade - off between the requirement on the reduction of chaos and the requirement on the specific shape of the control .",
    "+   + in this article , we apply the method of control based on ref .",
    "@xcite and developed in refs .",
    "we implement numerically an algorithm for finding a control term @xmath5 of order @xmath8 such that @xmath9 is integrable .",
    "this control term is expressed as a series whose terms can be explicitly and easily computed by recursion .",
    "this approach of control is `` dual '' with respect to kam theory  : kam theory is looking at coordinates making the system integrable . in this method of control",
    ", we slightly modify the hamiltonian such that the resulting controlled system is integrable .",
    "it is shown on an example of particles in a turbulent @xmath0 field that truncations of this control term @xmath5 provide effective control terms that significantly reduce chaotic transport .",
    "we show that with an electric potential with several frequencies , the partial control potential is time - dependent ( contrary to the one used in refs .",
    "@xcite and that it is able to drastically reduce the diffusion of test particle trajectories . +",

    "any other choice @xmath36 satisfies that the range @xmath37 is included into the kernel @xmath38 .",

    "we notice that when @xmath49 and @xmath33 commute , @xmath40 and @xmath39 are projectors , i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
