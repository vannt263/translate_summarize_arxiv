    "it has been well known that the star formation rate ( sfr ) density of the universe ( cosmic sfr density ) increases by an order of magnitude from the present to @xmath4 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "what kind of galaxies are contributing to such a large cosmic sfr density at @xmath4 is still an open question .    in recent years with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ , many studies focusing on understanding the properties of distant star - forming galaxies have been conducted .",
    "the cosmic sfr densities at high redshifts are dominated by infrared bright galaxies , especially luminous infrared ( ir ) galaxies ( lirgs ) which have ir ( 81000 @xmath5 m ) luminosities , @xmath15 , of @xmath16@xmath17 @xmath18 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see @xcite for a review on lirgs ) .",
    "their luminous ir emission is thermal dust emission in the mid - ir ( mir ) to far - ir ( fir ) wavelength caused by absorbing uv photons from intensive star formation and/or luminous active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "ir luminosity of @xmath16 @xmath18 corresponds to the sfr of @xmath9 15 @xmath2 yr@xmath19 ( @xcite ) , which is several to ten times larger than that of local normal galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "although in the local universe lirgs are rare and have only @xmath20% contribution to the ir luminosity density , the number density of lirgs increases with redshift , and 70% of the ir luminosity density is in lirgs at @xmath21 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to understand triggering processes of the lirgs to unveil the physical cause of the evolution of the cosmic sfr densities .    in the local universe ,",
    "most of lirgs show irregular morphologies , indicating galaxy - galaxy interaction ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . even among the lirgs which have spiral morphology",
    "apparently , a significant fraction of them shows bar structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "such morphological properties indicate that gas is pushed into the nuclear region and nuclear starburst is triggered .    on the contrary , at high redshifts ( @xmath22 ) , the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) imagings show that most of lirgs have spiral ( or late - type ) morphology without any clear sign of merging and/or interaction ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "those galaxies also have no bar structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in the last couple of years , some studies dedicated on mir spectra of such distant lirgs found their spectral shape indicates cool dust temperature similar to local spiral galaxies with lower ir luminosity ( @xmath15 @xmath23 @xmath18 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported that most of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah)-selected galaxies with @xmath24 at @xmath4 show pah - to - total ir luminosity ratio similar to that of less luminous starburst galaxies using an akari multi - wavelength mir photometry .",
    "those distant lirgs show similar properties to local massive spiral galaxies except for their high ir luminosities .",
    "previous morphological studies of lirgs at high redshifts were conducted in the rest - frame optical range .",
    "however , the high ir luminosity of lirgs indicates the presence of a large amount of dust , and then morphological analysis in near - ir ( nir ) range less affected by dust - extinction is necessary to examine existence of dust - obscured structures such as nuclear starburst seen in local lirgs or bars invisible in optical .",
    "nir wavelength is also suitable to reveal the distribution of old stellar populations which dominate stellar mass of galaxies . as a pioneering study in nir ,",
    "@xcite carried out targeted observations of 15 lirgs at @xmath25 with adaptive optics ( ao ) in the @xmath26-band , and evaluated their morphologies visually .",
    "it was found that two thirds of the lirgs look disky apparently while major mergers are @xmath27% at a maximum .",
    "they also found that only one lirg has a clear bar structure .",
    "the distant lirgs are different from local lirgs in morphology , and star formation in the distant lirgs seems to be smoothly distributed in their disk .    however , the morphological study by @xcite is based on the visual classification .",
    "further nir morphological studies with quantitative evaluation are necessary .",
    "in addition , although they observed normal galaxies ( non - lirgs ) at the similar redshifts , it is still crucial to locate lirgs in field galaxies in the same redshift range .    in this paper , we construct a stellar mass- and volume - limited , nir morphological catalog of galaxies at @xmath4 independent of ir luminosity using deep @xmath6-band data , and locate lirgs among @xmath4 galaxies .",
