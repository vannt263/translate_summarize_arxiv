    "large samples of galaxies at @xmath0 exist and allow us to study with unprecedented details the early epoch of galaxy assembly and star formation history ( e.g. see @xcite ) as well as to constrain the properties of sources responsible for reionization ( e.g. see @xcite )",
    ". hunting for high-@xmath1 galaxies usually follows two complementary approaches .",
    "one can either go for large area surveys , such as goods @xcite and , especially , cosmos @xcite , where the luminosity limit is about @xmath2 , or focus on small areas of the sky , such as has been done for the hdf @xcite and for the udf @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the magnitude limit is @xmath3 mag below @xmath4 ( udf limit ) and the aim is primarily that of probing the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "while this strategy has a good payoff in terms of galaxy detections , particularly when the slope of the luminosity function approaches two near the magnitude limit of the observations , the field of view of these pencil beam surveys is usually rather small , with the edge of the order of a few hundred arcseconds .",
    "therefore the number counts are significantly influenced by cosmic variance ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the surface density of i - dropouts at the goods depth found in one of the two hudf - nicmos parallel fields ( go 9803 , pi thompson - identified as hudfp2 in @xcite ) is only one third of the average value from all the @xmath5 acs fields in goods @xcite . even considering",
    "the much larger area of one goods field ( about @xmath6 ) the expected one sigma uncertainty in the number counts for lyman break galaxies at @xmath7 is still @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "relatively little effort has been so far devoted at quantifying the impact of cosmic variance on the determination of properties of high redshift galaxies .",
    "past studies have generally characterized only the variance of the number counts of a given cosmic volume @xcite or studied the full distribution but only in numerical simulations appropriate for local galaxies @xcite . the impact of cosmic variance on the measurement of the shape of the luminosity function at high redshift has never been addressed , despite the fact that it is known that there is an environmental dependence in the local universe , as @xmath9 in voids is about one magnitude fainter than in the field @xcite .",
    "our goal is to highlight the problem and to provide methods for addressing it .    in this paper",
    "we estimate the variance of the number counts using extended press - schechter analysis and we compute the distribution of number counts in synthetic surveys generated by using a monte carlo pencil beam tracer in snapshots from cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "our runs follow the evolution of dark matter particles only .",
    "galaxy luminosities are linked to the dark matter mass adopting the parametric models by @xcite and @xcite , that provide quite realistic output luminosity function .",
    "this numerical approach allows us to investigate how the best fitting parameters of the luminosity function depend on the environment probed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec  [ sec : cv_gen ] we define cosmic variance and we compute it using the extended press - schechter formalism . in sec .",

    "the number counts of galaxies in a survey are affected by a combination of discrete sampling , observational incompleteness and large scale structure . given a probability distribution @xmath10 for the number counts with mean @xmath11 and variance @xmath12 , we define the total fractional error of the counts @xmath13 as : @xmath14 the uncertainties in excess to poisson shot noise are usually quantified in terms of a relative `` cosmic variance '' ( e.g. see @xcite ) defined as : @xmath15 to evaluate the relative cosmic variance @xmath16 of a given sample , two main theoretical approaches are possible : ( i ) estimation based on the two point correlation function @xmath17 of the sample or ( ii ) direct measurement using mock catalogs from cosmological simulations of structure formation .    in the first case @xmath16",
    "is derived from @xmath17 as follows ( e.g. see @xcite ) : @xmath18 where the integration is carried out over the volume @xmath19 observed by the survey .",
    "the two point correlation function @xmath17 can either be derived from a cosmological model for the growth of density perturbations ( e.g. see @xcite ) , or from a simpler analytical model , such as a power law , with free parameters fixed by observational data ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "this method has the advantage of requiring little computational resources , limited to the evaluation of the multidimensional integral in eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma_from_xi ] , while being able to handle an arbitrarily large survey volume of any geometry .",
    "the main limitation is that only the second moment of the counts probability distribution @xmath10 can be obtained .",
    "this method also relies on an input two point correlation function which is typically evaluated only considering linear evolution of density perturbations ( see however @xcite for an analytical model of the non linear evolution of the power spectrum ) .",
    "in addition this framework assumes that all the survey volume is at a given redshift , which may not be appropriate for high redshift ( @xmath20 ) lyman break galaxies observations , where the pencil beam extends for about @xmath21 , an interval over which there is evidence of evolution of the galaxy luminosity function ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a direct measurement of @xmath10 from n - body simulations bypasses all these limitations but requires significant computational resources .",
    "in particular the cosmic volume simulated must be much larger than the survey volume , which in practice sets a limit on the survey area that can be adequately modeled .    to summarize ,",
    "if one is interested primarily in computing a total error budget on the number counts of a survey , the estimate of @xmath16 through integration of @xmath17 may be sufficient and requires relatively little effort .",
    "however in this paper we combine both methods , emphasizing especially the construction of mock catalogs from n - body simulations , as this is required to address the influence of cosmic variance on the uncertainty in the shape of the luminosity function .",

    "_ estimate the average incompleteness_. incompleteness will be close to 0 for selections much brighter than the magnitude limit of the survey but can be in the range @xmath25 when pushing detections up to the limit of the data @xcite .",
    "a precise estimate generally requires object recovery monte carlo simulations . * _ adopt a value for the average target - halo filling factor_. this is in general smaller than 1 , as a specific class of objects may be visible only for a limited period of time .",
    "for example in the case of lyman break galaxies , the duty cycle may be as low as @xmath26 ( e.g. see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the input information above is then used to estimate the total fractional uncertainty on the number counts as follows .",
    "* _ compute the minimum halo mass @xmath27 required to obtain the number density of halos hosting the survey population_. combining halo filling factor and intrinsic number of objects in the survey ( given the survey volume ) we compute the minimum halo mass in the @xcite model required to match the input number density .",
    "* _ compute the average bias of the sample_. we calculate the average bias of the sample using press - schechter model @xcite . * _ integrate the dark matter @xmath17 over the survey volume_. the dark matter two point correlation function is integrated over the pencil beam geometry of the volume ( cf .",

    "the single particle mass is @xmath56 and guarantees that the host halos that we consider ( @xmath57 ) are resolved with at least @xmath58 particles in the deepest survey that we simulate . to investigate the cosmic variance in larger area , less deep surveys , such as goods , we use instead",
    "a larger box , of size @xmath59 mpc / h , also simulated with @xmath50 particles .",

    "dark matter halos are identified in the simulations snapshots ( saved every @xmath65 in the redshift interval @xmath66 ) using the hop halo finder @xcite , with the following parameters : the local density around each particle is constructed using a 16 particles smoothing kernel , while for the regrouping algorithm we use @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and a minimum group size of @xmath58 particles . the halo mass distribution in the snapshots is well described ( with displacements within @xmath70 ) by a @xcite mass function .",
    "one limitation that has to be taken into account when estimating the cosmic variance from n - body simulations is the cosmic variance of the complete simulation volume .",
    "for example , in our @xmath50 particles , @xmath49 mpc / h edge box run there are 2620 dark matter halos at @xmath71 with more than 100 particles and the differences in this number from run to run are larger than the nominal poisson variance .",
    "we checked this effect by carrying out a control run with the same initial conditions but a different seed for the random number generator obtaining a difference of @xmath72 .",
    "the use of a larger box and @xmath73 particles in our highest resolution run is expected to reduce run to run variations , but we cautiously assume a @xmath74 relative uncertainty on the value of the cosmic variance that we derive through this paper .",
    "in addition , in the @xmath73 simulation we also save snapshots at intervals @xmath75 from @xmath76 to @xmath77 in order to provide a preliminary characterization of cosmic variance in future jwst nircam surveys .",
    "our pencil beam tracer is similar to the one developed by @xcite , but it is optimized for high @xmath1 surveys , allowing us in particular to take advantage of the quasi - constant angular distance versus redshift relation .",
    "we trace through the simulation box a parallelepiped where the base is a parallelogram , whose size is given by the field of view of the survey in comoving units , and the depth is the comoving depth associated with the redshift uncertainty of the selection window for lyman break galaxies which we are interested in .",
    "this choice means that we are neglecting the variation of angular distance versus redshift in the redshift interval of the selection window considered .",
    "for example , the comoving edge of the acs field of view for v - dropouts is @xmath78 mpc / h at @xmath79 and @xmath80 mpc / h at @xmath81 , and we approximate it with @xmath82 mpc / h . the pencil beam is traced through different snapshots as we swipe through its depth , and , consistently with our angular size approximation , we assume an average value for @xmath83 ( the redshift difference between two snapshots ) expressed in comoving distance .",
    "the choice to save snapshots at @xmath65 implies that a single beam passes through several different snapshots so that the evolution in the halo mass function is well captured .",
    "@xmath84 is equivalent to about @xmath58 mpc / h at @xmath71 and the evolution in the number density of halos at the same mass scale between two adjacent snapshots is of the order @xmath85 .",
    "the beam starts at a random position within the simulation volume and then proceeds through the cube with periodic boundary conditions , angled using the following choices for the two direction angles @xmath86 and @xmath87 : @xmath88 and @xmath89 these values have been selected to guarantee no superposition and adequate spacing for a typical hst - acs lyman break dropouts beam as it wraps around the simulation box due to the periodic initial conditions .",

    "dark matter halos within a simulated field of view are populated with galaxies accordingly to a simple halo occupation distribution ( hod ) model .",

    "a fraction @xmath97 is finally identified as lyman break galaxies ( this is to take into account possible observational incompleteness and/or a duty cycle where lbgs are on only for a fraction of their lifetime ) .",

    "in addition we also investigate the effect of changing the box size , the resolution and the @xmath44 value of the n - body simulations using both our @xmath104 and our @xmath105 runs .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is kept as free parameter and it is adjusted to have the same average number of counts in all three cases .",
    "the required variations of @xmath27 are limited within a factor two .",
    "the distribution of the number counts probability is very similar in the four cases ( see table  [ tab : uncert ] for @xmath106 values ) and shows that the characterization of the cosmic variance versus the average number counts is solid with respect to the details of the modeling .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that by changing @xmath27 by a factor of 2 , the average bias of the sample varies only by less than @xmath107 .",
    "this is reassuring as there are large theoretical uncertainties on modeling high redshift galaxy formation .",
    "the importance of modeling correctly the geometry of the field of view to quantify the cosmic variance is shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : shape ] . here",
    "we focus on a single snapshot at @xmath108 and we measure the total fractional error @xmath106 of number counts in a volume of @xmath109 with different shapes . from fig .",
    "[ fig : shape ] , @xmath106 is largest in the quasi - cubical volume and smallest for the pencil beam .",
    "therefore cosmic variance computed only from the total volume of the survey , assumed to be a sphere as in @xcite , is overestimated .",
    "this is because a narrow and long pencil beam probes many different environments , while a cubic volume may sit for a significant fraction of its volume either on under - dense or on over - dense regions . in all cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : idrop_models ] , the total error exceeds poisson noise and the contribution from cosmic variance is dominant especially when the average number of counts in the volume is much larger than one .",
    "[ fig : shape ] also shows an excellent agreement between the measurement from cosmological simulations and the analytical estimate using the two point correlation function .",
    "our numerical simulations follow the evolution of dark matter only , therefore we have to assume a mass - luminosity relation to investigate the influence of the cosmic variance on the determination of the luminosity function . for this",
    "we extend to higher redshift the fitting formulas used by @xcite and by @xcite adopting : @xmath110^{1/d}},\\ ] ] and assuming @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath116 is conventionally set to @xmath117 . as the main goal of this paper is not to provide a detailed modeling of the mass - luminosity relation , but rather to investigate the dependence of the luminosity function parameters on the environment and on the fitting method adopted , the simple modeling of eq .",
    "[ eq : lm ] appears adequate .    for a fully consistent representation of the observational selection process for lyman break galaxies",
    ", it would be necessary to apply a luminosity cut in the apparent and not in the absolute magnitude .",
    "the apparent luminosity - distance relation does in fact evolve quite significantly over a redshift range @xmath118 ( e.g. see @xcite fig . 7 ) .",
    "this effect leads to a reduction of the effective volume of the survey and thus to an increase of the cosmic variance contribution to the counts uncertainty .",
    "this is because dropouts tend to be preferentially selected in the low redshift corner of the selection window , even if luminosity evolution with redshift will partially offset this trend as galaxies at higher @xmath1 appear to have a higher @xmath119 ratio ( see @xcite ) . in our standard model for number counts uncertainty from numerical simulations",
    "we apply a cutoff in mass ( that is in absolute magnitude ) , which gives us a framework consistent with the estimates from the two point correlation function . to evaluate the error introduced by this assumption we have implemented a cutoff in observed magnitude for an acs i - dropout sample with 40 detections on average constructed from our cosmological simulation at high resolution and using the relation between observed @xmath4 and redshift @xmath1 as plotted in fig .  7 of @xcite . the resulting number counts distribution is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : idrop_models ] .",
    "the total fractional uncertainty in the number counts is only marginally higher ( @xmath120 vs. @xmath121 ) than in the case where a cutoff in absolute magnitude is applied .",
    "the results from our simulated distribution of number counts for different high redshift surveys are reported in figs .  [",
    "fig : vidrop]-[fig : zjdrop ] . for a given survey geometry we plot the fractional number counts uncertainty @xmath106 as a function of their average value .",
    "this facilitates the application to surveys at different depths .",
    "given that the details of the halo occupation model have only a modest influence on the value of @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : idrop_models ] ) , we resort in this paper to a reference model of one galaxy per halo , with @xmath98 ( i.e. unit probability of detection ) unless otherwise noted . in addition , we highlight the expected total fractional uncertainty on the number counts due to poisson noise only .    at the typical number counts for a field at the udf depth",
    "the total fractional uncertainty is @xmath122 for v - dropouts ( assuming 100 detections per field , see @xcite ) and @xmath123 for i - dropouts ( assuming 50 detections per field , see @xcite ) .",
    "this is much smaller than the poisson noise associated to the average realized number counts .",
    "therefore cosmic variance is the dominant source of uncertainty for udf - like deep fields . at",
    "lower number counts per field of view , that is when the survey is shallower , the poisson contribution to the total fractional uncertainty @xmath106 increases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_poi ] ) until it becomes dominant at the limit of zero average counts .",
    "the agreement between @xmath106 estimated using the two point correlation function and that measured in the numerical simulations is very good .",
    "the framework is also consistent with the observed clustering of high - redshift galaxies , such as measured by @xcite : our standard recipe for populating dark matter halos with galaxies gives an average galaxy - dark matter bias @xmath124 for an acs i - dropout sample with 60 detections on average , a value within the one sigma error bar in the measurement by @xcite .",
    "note however that the large observational uncertainties do not allow a more detailed quantitative comparison .    from the full probability distribution on the number counts , derived from our simulations",
    ", we can also evaluate the likelihood of finding a factor 2 overdensity in galaxies at @xmath125 in the udf field as reported by @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the expected number of galaxies in that redshift interval is 7.5 , the fractional uncertainty in the counts turns out to be @xmath126 and the probability of @xmath127 or more realized counts in that redshift interval is greater than @xmath74 ( this has been measured taking advantage of the full probability distribution obtained through the simulations ) .",
    "therefore the measured fluctuation , while lying outside the standard deviation , is not exceptional . given that a i - dropouts selection window contains about 5 intervals of width @xmath128 , one overdensity such as that observed by @xcite will be present in a significant number of random pointings .    to characterize the number counts uncertainty in the larger area goods survey we resort to the simulation with edge @xmath129 , whose results",
    "are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : idropgoods ] for the combination of the two north and south fields .",
    "@xmath106 is consistent with the estimate using the two point correlation function within a relative difference of @xmath130 at most .",
    "interestingly , the i - dropouts cosmic variance in one goods field is not too different from the one for a smaller but deeper udf field .",
    "this is due to two effects : ( i ) the increased sensitivity of the udf enables to detect fainter lyman break galaxies and thus to probe the distribution of smaller mass halos that are progressively less clustered , ( ii ) there is a significant correlation between the counts in adjacent fields .    to better quantify this latter effect , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] the linear correlation coefficient between the i - dropouts counts in two nearby acs fields : @xmath131 where @xmath132 the linear correlation has been computed using the analytical model from the two point correlation function .",
    "two adjacent i - dropouts fields at the udf depth ( 50 counts on average ) have a linear correlation in the number counts of about @xmath133 .",
    "the correlation decreases rapidly as the separation increases and fields separated by more than @xmath134 arcsec have @xmath135 .",
    "therefore hst parallel fields , typically separated by 550 arcsec , are essentially independent from each other . with independent fields",
    "the variance of the total counts is given by the sum of the variances in each field ( as the set of counts in the fields are independent variables ) .",
    "for higher redshift lyman break galaxies , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : zjdrop ] the number counts uncertainty within both nicmos and wfc3 fields .",
    "a single nicmos field has such a small area ( @xmath136 arcmin@xmath137 ) that @xmath106 is dominated by poisson noise up to a few counts per arcmin@xmath137 .",
    "the effect of cosmic variance in the number counts uncertainty is instead more evident in a hst - wfc3 like field of view , where the uncertainty is significantly higher than poisson noise .",
    "a very interesting conclusion that can be drawn from the figure is that the number counts uncertainty in the six independent main and parallel nicmos fields , obtained through the hdf , hdf - south , udf and the udf follow - up programs , is lower than that of one deep wfc3 field , despite covering slightly less area .",
    "this example nicely shows that in order to minimize cosmic variance effects in future surveys aimed at detecting @xmath138 lyman break galaxies a sparse coverage is optimal .",
    "of course a continuous coverage has the advantage of enabling other science , such as weak lensing studies at lower redshift .      as a preliminary characterization of cosmic variance in future jwst lyman break galaxy surveys , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : jwst ] the cosmic variance for nircam f090w , f115w and f150w dropouts as given by the combination of the two nearby field of views of nircam .",

    "[ eq : lm ] ) .",
    "the light cone has been traced through snapshots in our @xmath73 particles run , considering dark matter halos down to @xmath140 particles ( that is to a mass limit of @xmath141 ) . if the same cutoff is applied to an acs i - dropouts survey , then we get about @xmath142 i - dropouts per field of view ( corresponding to a magnitude limit @xmath143 using the @xcite luminosity function ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : jwst ] the rapid evolution of the dark matter halo mass function greatly reduces the number of halos above the cut - off mass within the pencil beam at @xmath144 .",
    "therefore the expected number of f150w dropouts detections per nircam field is only @xmath145 and these observations would be affected primarily by poisson uncertainty .",
    "these numbers have been derived assuming a mass luminosity relation of dropouts at @xmath146 consistent with that of i - dropouts , as deep surveys with jwst are expected to reach about the @xmath71 udf sensitivity up to @xmath147 .",
    "of course , it is well possible that the actual detections of f150w dropouts will be higher if these primordial galaxies are more luminous than their @xmath148 counterparts , similarly to what happens between @xmath46 and @xmath71 ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , for a precise estimate of the expected number of these very high redshift objects in deep jwst surveys a detailed modeling of the relation between intrinsic and observed luminosity is required .",
    "at least dust reddening should however play only a minor effect ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if we consider narrow band searches for high redshift galaxies we typically have a different beam geometry , given by a large field of view with a small redshift depth .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xcite detect more than 500 lyman-@xmath149 emitters at @xmath150 in a @xmath151 area . under these conditions , we estimate @xmath152 , more than 3 times the poisson uncertainty of the counts .",
    "the large variance is given by a combination of a contiguous field of view with a small redshift interval probed , which gives a cosmic volume probed by this search roughly equivalent to that of a single @xmath153 arcmin@xmath137 i - dropouts goods field .",
    "the main influence of the environment probed by a deep field is on the observed number density of galaxies and therefore on the normalization of the luminosity function .",
    "however , the shape of the luminosity function can also be affected .",
    "this is the case in the local universe , where it has been observed that the luminosity function in voids is steeper than in the field ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , but this possibility seems to be neglected when deriving the luminosity function for lyman break galaxies ( e.g. , in @xcite ) .    to highlight the importance of this effect even at high redshift , we plot in fig .",

    "the ratio of the massive to total counts can be adopted as an estimate for the steepness ( i.e. the shape ) of the luminosity function . from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : slope ] it is clear that when the beam passes through under - dense regions the ratio easily decreases on average by more than a factor two , although a large scatter is present .",
    "this shows that the shape of the mass ( luminosity ) function does indeed depend on the environment .    to understand better the origin of this effect we consider two idealized scenarios to model the relation between bright and total counts , where we consider only poisson uncertainties",
    "the first ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : slope_poi ] ) has been obtained by assuming that the bright counts are completely uncorrelated from fainter ones .",
    "therefore we have : @xmath158 where @xmath159 ( that is the average difference between the total and bright counts ) depends on the minimum mass cut - off mass considered .",
    "when @xmath160 bright and total counts are almost uncorrelated between each other and therefore when a field is underdense in bright counts , total counts are almost unaffected and its luminosity function appears on average ( much ) steeper .",
    "the luminosity function is instead ( quasi ) shape - invariant when we consider a model with a total correlation between bright and total counts , where @xmath161 with @xmath162 depending again on the minimum mass cut - off mass considered .",
    "the results for this model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slope_corr ] and have been obtained by first sampling the bright counts ( @xmath163 ) from a poisson distribution with average @xmath164 , and then sampling the faint counts @xmath165 from a poisson distribution with average @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "this gives an average total number counts @xmath168 .    a realistic distribution of the counts , such as that obtained from our mock catalogs is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slope ] and lies between the two extreme cases considered as toy models .",
    "in particular , the low @xmath169 behavior of the @xmath170 ratio is dominated by the correlation with @xmath169 , as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : slope ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : slope_poi ] .",
    "this is because the large scale structure introduces a correlation between bright and faint counts but this correlation is not total .",
    "in fact deeper surveys probe smaller mass halos , whose formation probability is sensitive to higher frequencies in the power spectrum of primordial density perturbations than that for more massive halos targeted in shallower observations of the same field .",
    "the results of the previous section suggest that a more thorough characterization of the large scale structure influence on the mass function at high redshift is required . our main aim is to look for systematic variations depending on the realized number counts value and on the details of the fitting procedure employed .",
    "we fit a schechter function in the form : @xmath171 ) dl,\\ ] ] to the distribution of galaxy luminosity derived from the dark matter halo masses measured in our monte carlo code and transformed in luminosities using the prescription of eq .",
    "[ eq : lm ] . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : lm ] , our treatment to build a sample of galaxy luminosities is idealized and we are missing many observational effects , such as apparent luminosity vs. redshift evolution and redshift dependent selection effects within the redshift interval considered .",
    "our main aim is to highlight the importance of large scale structure in the fitting of the luminosity function and not to construct a detailed representation of observations .",
    "we start by considering , for a simulated v - dropout deep sample in one acs field ( 200 galaxies on average in the pencil beam ) , the distribution of the schechter function parameter @xmath4 and @xmath149 for 4000 monte carlo realizations .",
    "we estimate the parameters using a standard maximum likelihood estimator on the unbinned detections , following essentially the procedure described in @xcite ( stj79 ) . for each synthetic catalog @xmath172",
    "we compute the likelihood for the luminosity function in eq :  [ eq : schelf ] : @xmath173 where the @xmath174 is fixed by integrating the luminosity function up to the detection limit @xmath175 of the survey and imposing the normalization : @xmath176 the maximization of the likelihood @xmath177 is then carried out on a two dimensional grid with spacing @xmath178 and @xmath179 , where @xmath180 .",
    "the resulting distribution of best fitting parameters for the 4000 synthetic catalogs that we have generated are reported in fig .  [",
    "fig : binning ] and highlight the degeneration between @xmath9 and @xmath149 parameters . by plotting @xmath4 and @xmath149 as a function of the number counts of the survey ( fig .",
    "[ fig : par_vs_n ] ) we can see that the slope of the luminosity function does not depend on the environment , while @xmath4 does .",
    "when the number of counts in a field is above the average , @xmath4 is larger , although the scatter at fixed number of counts is significant .    to further quantify the effect of cosmic scatter on the luminosity function fitting , we consider the case where lyman break galaxies are detected both in a large area deep survey , such as goods , as well as in a single , or few , pencil beams at a greater depth , such as the udf and udf follow - up fields .",
    "this combination of data appears ideal from the observational point of view as it allows us to constraint the break @xmath4 of the luminosity function using detections from the large area , shallower , survey , and the faint end slope using the deeper dataset .",
    "however , the fitting procedure employed may lead to artificial biases , especially when one tries to naively correct for the effects of cosmic variance by considering its effect on @xmath174 alone .",
    "in fact , one might be tempted to re - normalize the luminosity function for the deeper fields by considering the number of dropouts galaxies detected at the same depth of the larger area , fainter survey .",
    "for example , this is what has been done by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , who obtained the luminosity function for i - dropouts by multiplying the udf and udf parallel fields counts by the factors @xmath181 and @xmath182 ( respectively ) in order to account for a deficit of bright detections with respect to the goods fields .",
    "this correction has two potential problems that may contribute to introducing an artificial steepening of the luminosity function and both problems are apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : slope ] .",
    "first of all it is clear from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : slope ] that if one were to rescale the luminosity function of the deeper field , a relation of the form @xmath183 would not be justified , as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : lfsteep ] .",
    "in fact , the best fitting linear relation for the counts in fig .  [",
    "fig : slope ] is @xmath184 .",
    "this implies that a 50% deficit in bright counts with respect to the average would correspond on average to only a @xmath185 deficit in faint counts and not to the @xmath186 naive estimate of the deficit .",
    "there is also a second , subtler effect introduced by a renormalization of the luminosity function based on the number counts : @xmath187 is strongly correlated with @xmath169 in underdense fields due to the lack of luminous galaxies , so a renormalization of the data based on matching the @xmath169 counts to a reference value introduces an artificial steepening of the faint end of the luminosity function .    as a quantitative example",
    ", we consider a test case where the luminosity function is determined by goods - like data ( one @xmath188 arcmin@xmath137 field ) at the bright end and by one acs field at the faint end .",
    "the average number counts per @xmath156 that we adopt are @xmath189 for the bright end and @xmath190 for the deeper field ( to be consistent with the number densities in @xcite ) .",
    "this gives us an average of @xmath191 bright objects in the large area field and of @xmath49 objects down to the fainter limit of the udf - like field .",
    "the luminosity function is then fitted by adopting three different methods :    1 .",
    "first an observed luminosity function is constructed from the synthetic catalogs using binned data ( 0.5 mag bins ) by combining the data from the two surveys with no large scale structure correction , as described in sec 5.3 of @xcite .",
    "then we fit the model luminosity function using a maximum likelihood approach to these binned data , that is we compute the theoretical expectation for the number of objects in each magnitude bin and then we maximize the likelihood under the assumption that the counts in each bin are poisson distributed .",
    "maximum likelihood on binned data , as in point ( i ) above , but here the luminosity function determination includes a large scale correction a la bouwens et al .",
    "( that is relying on the relation @xmath192 . ) , as in sec .",
    "5.1 of @xcite .",
    "3 .   unbinned maximum likelihood modeling of the data with free normalization of the data between the deep and wide fields .",
    "the procedure is a straightforward generalization of what discussed above for the determination of the luminosity function in a single field and proceeds as described in @xcite , where this method has been first applied to luminosity function fitting .",
    "the results from these different fitting methods are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ml_idrop_combo ] , where we plot the contour levels of the distribution of the best fitting luminosity function parameters obtained from 600 different combinations of deep and wide fields .",
    "all the parameters are shown as a function of the total number counts in the deep field . the maximum likelihood method with free normalization between the two fields @xcite has a one sigma uncertainty of @xmath193 on @xmath149 and of @xmath194 on @xmath9 .",
    "the uncertainties are similar for when the fit is performed on binned data without using the large scale renormalization of @xcite , but in this case the fixed normalization between the two fields introduces a bias in @xmath149 , with underdense deep fields leading to a shallower slope .",
    "applying the environment renormalization following @xcite does over - correct the problem with a larger uncertainty in @xmath149 and @xmath9 ( @xmath195 and @xmath196 respectively ) and a preference for steeper shapes of the luminosity function .",
    "this is an artifact as the faint end of the luminosity function is overestimated by the correction applied when the deep field is lacking luminous galaxies .",
    "this behavior is also apparent from the fits performed in @xcite : , e.g. in their table 6 they estimate for i - dropouts @xmath197 using a maximum likelihood approach similar to @xcite and @xmath198 using the large scale renormalization method .",
    "in this paper , we present detailed estimates of the variance in the number counts of lyman break galaxies for high redshift deep surveys and of the resulting impact on the determination of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the number counts distribution has been derived from collisionless , dark matter only cosmological simulations of structure formation assuming a @xmath139 relation and has been compared with analytical estimates obtained from the two point correlation function of dark matter halos .",
    "halos have been identified in the simulations snapshots , saved at high frequency ( @xmath84 up to @xmath76 ) and a pencil beam tracer monte carlo code has been used to construct synthetic catalogs of the halos above a minimum mass threshold within the selection window for lyman break galaxies at different redshifts ( corresponding to v , i , z and j dropouts for hst surveys ) .",
    "in addition we also consider jwst nircam f090w , f115w and f150w dropouts up to @xmath77 .    by populating the dark matter halos with galaxies using different semi - analytical prescriptions , that include multiple halo occupation and different detection probabilities , we have shown that , to first order , the standard deviation of the number counts for a given dropout population depends mainly on the average value of number counts and on the geometry of the pencil beam .",
    "this is because the average bias of the population varies little as a function of the number density and is reassuring for the robustness of our results , as it means that the still uncertain details of high redshift galaxy formation are unlikely to significantly affect the amount of cosmic variance in deep surveys .",
    "the distribution of the number counts around its central value is highly skewed for low number counts , while it becomes progressively more symmetric as the average number of objects in the field of view increases .",
    "the ratio of the measured variance to the variance expected from poisson noise is an increasing function of the average number of objects in the field . for the typical number counts of v and i",
    "- dropout in an acs field of view at the udf depth the one sigma fractional uncertainty is about three times that due to poisson noise .",
    "this has a major impact on the rarity of overdensities of high redshift galaxies such as those reported by @xcite , that while highly significant with respect to a poisson statistics , turn out to be not uncommon when the effect of clustering is taken into account ( e.g. at the @xmath199 level in the @xcite case ) .",
    "the geometry of the volume probed is fundamental in defining the number counts variance and a long and narrow beam has a lower variance with respect to that estimated from an equivalent spherical ( or cubical ) volume .",
    "this is because the long beam passes through many different environments , while a spherical volume may happen to sit right on top of extreme over - densities or under - densities .",
    "for example for i - dropouts an acs like field of view of @xmath200 has a fractional uncertainty of @xmath201 for 100 counts on average , while an equivalent cubic volume would have an uncertainty of @xmath202 .",
    "number counts in nearby fields are significantly correlated : for i - dropouts , two adjacent acs fields with 50 i - dropouts counts on average , have a linear correlation coefficient @xmath203 .",
    "this becomes @xmath204 at angular separation of about @xmath205 arcsec .",
    "this has two important consequences : ( i ) large area surveys with adjacent exposures such as goods are still affected by a non - negligible amount of cosmic variance , so that @xmath106 is of the order of @xmath206 for i - dropouts down to its faint detection limit and combining the two north and south fields , and ( ii ) hst parallel observations , separated by about @xmath207 arcsec , such as those from the udf and udf follow - up programs , can be considered essentially independent fields . for independent fields the cosmic variance decreases as the square root of the number of fields",
    "( in fact the variance from independent variables sums up in quadrature ) . from the point of view of future observations",
    "this also implies that the currently existing six ultra deep nicmos fields have a smaller total cosmic variance with respect to a future single wfc3 deep field to comparable depth , despite the greater area of the latter .    using a simple mass - luminosity relation ( eq .",
    "[ eq : lm ] ) we also investigate the effects of cosmic variance on the determination of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the impact of cosmic variance is not limited on the normalization of the luminosity function , but extends also to its shape .",
    "in fact , the luminosity function for under - dense regions appears to be steeper than for field and cluster environments . by fitting a schechter function to synthetic catalogs of v - dropouts galaxies in a udf - like survey",
    "we find that @xmath9 varies by about one magnitude from over - dense to under - dense fields , while the slope @xmath149 remains approximately unchanged .",
    "an important caveat is that , as we have taken into account essentially only dark matter clustering in our modeling , our result could be changed if strong feedback effects due to baryon physics are important .",
    "this dependence of the luminosity function on the number counts of the field has important consequences when attempts to correct for a deficit of detections are made in dataset that combine a large area survey with a small , deeper area .",
    "in fact , an artificial steepening of the estimated luminosity function from binned data may arise when naive corrections to account for under - densities are used , such as a re - normalization of the faint end of the luminosity function in terms of the ratio of bright counts in the deep area of the survey with respect to the average value of bright counts over the whole survey area .    therefore to determine the luminosity function for such survey configurations the best approach appears to be the maximum likelihood method applied to the unbinned data , as originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "the first step is to determine the shape ( @xmath149 and @xmath9 ) of the schechter function probability distribution , in case convolved with a detection probability kernel to take into account incompleteness and selection effects .",
    "this can be done by combining the likelihood of both faint and bright counts , but allowing the normalization @xmath174 to be a free parameter and to vary among the two samples .",
    "next , @xmath174 is estimated from the total number counts of the two samples , compared with the expectation from integration of the luminosity function between the relevant luminosity limits .",
    "this method appears to be relatively unbiased with respect to cosmic variance and represents an approach that does not require to quantify the relative normalization of the detections in the different fields considered",
    ".    finally we stress that the intrinsic uncertainty due to cosmic variance present while estimating the luminosity function parameters must be taken into account when claims are made on the redshift evolution of these parameters . for example , by combining one goods - like field with a single deep , udf like field , cosmic variance introduces a @xmath208 uncertainty in @xmath149 of @xmath209 .",
    "this error is a systematic contribution that comes on top of any other contribution to the total error budget .",
