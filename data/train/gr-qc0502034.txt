    "the detection and interpretation of gravitational wave signals from inspiralling black holes or neutron stars requires a solution of einstein s equations for the late stages of the inspiral@xcite .",
    "much effort is going into the development of computer codes that will evolve solutions forward in time . for recent progress",
    "see @xcite .",
    "such codes will eventually provide the needed answers about the strong field interaction and merger of the binary objects , but many technical challenges of such a computation slow the development of the needed codes .",
    "this has led us to propose , as a near term alternative , the periodic standing wave ( psw ) approach .",
    "elements of this approximation have been introduced elsewhere @xcite , but are most thoroughly presented in a recent paper@xcite that we will hereafter refer to as `` paper i. '' in the psw approach , a numerical solution is sought to einstein s equations , not for a spacetime geometry evolved from initial data , but rather for sources and fields that rotate rigidly ( i.e. , with a helical killing vector ) and that are coupled to standing waves .",
    "paper i gives the details of how to extract from this solution an approximation to the problem of interest : a slowly inspiralling pair of objects coupled to outgoing waves .",
    "paper i also describes the nature of the mathematical problem that must be solved numerically : a boundary - value problem with `` standing wave boundary conditions '' on a large sphere surrounding the sources .",
    "the differential equations of this boundary value problem are mixed , elliptical in one region ( inside a `` light cylinder '' ) and hyperbolic in another ( outside ) .",
    "the method of solution in paper i was straightforward .",
    "the differential equations and boundary conditions were implemented with a finite difference method ( fdm ) in a single patch of standard corotating spherical coordinates .",
    "the equations were solved with newton - raphson iteration of a sequence of linear approximations , and a straightforward inversion of each linear approximation .",
    "the relative simplicity of this approach was useful to demonstrate the basic well - posedness and solubility of the problem and to illustrate the important issues of the psw method , especially the `` effective linearity '' that explains the accuracy of the psw approximation for the physical solution .",
    "the method , however , has severe shortcomings .",
    "multipole moments , and hence spherical coordinates are necessary in the wave zone for the imposition of outer boundary conditions and for the extraction of outgoing solutions from standing - wave solutions .",
    "spherical , and other standard coordinates are , however , not well suited to resolving the relatively small sources of the binary .",
    "this is especially true if the sources are to be represented by boundary conditions on the outer surface of a source , rather than by explicit source terms .",
    "the usual technique for handling such problems is coordinate patches and interpolation",
    ". this would be particularly inconvenient for the psw computations since standard iterative approaches are inapplicable to mixed equations .",
    "in this paper we report on an alternative approach , one that has the disadvantage of adding some analytic complexity to the problem , and some worrisome features .",
    "but it is a method that gives both remarkably efficient results for model problems , and a potentially useful new approach to the coupling of moving sources to their radiation field .",
    "this new method is based on a coordinate system that is adapted to the local structure of the sources and to the large - scale structure of the distant waves .",
    "though the psw computations have been the proximate motivation for introducing an adapted coordinate system , the success with this system suggests that its utility may be more broadly applicable .",
    "such coordinates , in fact , have already been exploited , even in numerical relativity .",
    "`` ade coordinates''@xcite , a carefully adapted coordinate system of this type , was used in much of the work on head - on collisions of black holes , and has more recently found to be useful@xcite for initial data and apparent horizon finding . like the ade coordinates , our coordinate systems will reduce to source - centered spherical polar coordinates in the vicinity of the sources , and to rotation - centered spherical polar coordinates far from the sources .",
    "the core of the usefulness of the adapted coordinates is that the field near the sources is well described by a few multipoles in these coordinates , primarily the monopole of the sources , and that the field far from the sources is well described only by a few multipoles in these coordinates .",
    "a spectral method ( that is , a multipole decomposition ) , therefore , requires only a small number of multipoles .",
    "we will demonstrate , in fact , that for mildly relativistic sources ( source velocity = 30% @xmath0 ) , excellent results are found when we keep only monopole and quadrupole terms .",
    "there is , of course , a price to be paid for this .",
    "for one thing , there is additional analytic complexity in the set of equations .",
    "another difficulty is the unavoidable coordinate singularity that is a feature of coordinates adapted to the two different limiting regions .",
    "still , the potential usefulness of the method , and the success reported here have led to us treating this approach as the main focus of our computations in the psw work .",
    "the innovative features of this method present enough new uncertainties that it is important to study this method in the context of the simplest problem possible .",
    "we use , therefore , the same model problem as in paper i , a simple scalar field theory with an adjustable nonlinearity .",
    "we will find it quite useful to set the nonlinearity to zero for comparison with the known solution of the linear problem , since many features of our method are unusual even for a linear problem .    for the description of our model problem , we start with euclidean space coordinatized by the usual spherical coordinates @xmath1 , and we consider sources concentrated near the points @xmath2 , @xmath3 , in the equatorial plane , and moving symmetrically according to @xmath4 and @xmath5 . as in paper",
    "i , we seek a solution of the flat - spacetime scalar field equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 depends nonlinearly on @xmath8 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath7 will be the same as that in paper i. this will allow comparisons with the results of the very different numerical technique in paper i , and , as in paper i , allows a very useful comparison of the near - source nonlinear solution with an analytic limit .",

    "it is useful to introduce the auxiliary coordinate @xmath11 . in terms of spacetime",
    "coordinates @xmath12 the killing vector is simply @xmath13 and the symmetry condition becomes the requirement that the scalar field @xmath8 is a function only of the variables @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "[ sec : adapcoord ] we introduce the concept of adapted coordinates , comoving coordinates that conform to the source geometry near the source and that become spherical comoving coordinates far from the source .",
    "a particular system of adapted coordinates , two center bispherical coordinates ( tcbc ) , is introduced in this section .",
    "though these coordinates are not optimal for computational accuracy , they have the advantage of analytic simplicity and are the only adapted coordinates explicitly used in the computations of this paper .",
    "though the tcbc system is relatively simple it is still sufficiently complex that that many details of the use of this method are relegated to appendix [ app:3dcoeffs ] .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : adapcoord ] we also discuss the use of these adapted coordinates in a fdm calculation , and explain the computational difficulties we encountered in trying to find stable solutions with this approach .",
    "these difficulties led us to use a spectral type method with the adapted coordintes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectral ] we present the fundamental ideas of expanding the solution in spherical harmonics of the angular adapted coordinates . in this section",
    "we also explain why we are not , strictly speaking , using a spectral method since we do the angular differencing by fdm , not by relationships of the spherical harmonics .",
    "( for background on spectral methods , and an important recent use of spectral methods in numerical relativity , see @xcite . )",
    "furthermore , we keep many fewer multipoles than would in principle be justified by the number of points in our angular grid .",
    "this `` multipole filtering '' is one of the most interesting and innovative aspects of our method .",
    "because the adapted coordinates in some sense handle much of the computation analytically only a few multipoles need be kept . in most of the results , in fact , only monopole and quadrupole moments are kept .    to illustrate a more standard spectral method , we present in appendix [ app : ssm2d ] a standard spectral approach to the linear psw problem in two spatial dimensions described in tcbc coordinates .",
    "the appendix also uses severe multipole filtering and serves to demonstrate in a very different , and generally simpler , numerical context the fundamental correctness of multipole filtering .    for the problem in three spatial dimensions",
    ", we have found that a special technique must be used for multipole expansion and multipole filtering .",
    "a straightforward approach would use the continuum multipoles evaluated on the angular grid .",
    "we explain in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectral ] why this method involves unacceptably large numerical errors , and why we introduce a second innovative numerical technique , one that we call the `` eigenspectral method . '' in place of the continuum spherical harmonics evaluated on the angular grid , we use eigenvectors of the angular fdm laplacian .",
    "these eigenvectors approach the grid - evaluated continuum spherical harmonics as the grid becomes finer but , as we explain in this section , the small differences are very important in the multipole expansion / filtering method . some of the details of the eigenspectral method are put into appendix [ app : esmdetails ] , in particular the way the fdm angular laplacian can be treated as a self - adjoint operator .",
    "section [ sec : modmeth ] starts by presenting the details of the model scalar field problems to which we apply the eigenspectral method : the choice of the nonlinearity , and the justification for this choice ; the manner in which we choose data on an inner boundary taken to be the outer surface of a source ; the outer radiative boundary conditions ; the newton - raphson procedure for finding solutions to nonlinear problems ; and the method by which we extract approximate nonlinear outgoing solutions from computed nonlinear standing wave solutions .",
    "this is followed , in sec .",
    "[ sec : numresults ] , by a presentation of numerical results that demonstrate convergence of the method .",
    "these results show that the numerical methods are quite accurate despite the inclusion of only a very minimal number of multipoles . in addition",
    ", the power of the numerical method allows us to compute models with much stronger nonlinearity than could be handled with the straightforward fdm of paper i. for these highly nonlinear models we confirm the `` effective linearity '' that was demonstrated in paper i with less dramatic models : the outgoing solution extracted from a standing wave solution is an excellent approximation to the true outgoing solution , even for very strong nonlinearity .",
    "conclusions are briefly summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we follow the notation of paper i@xcite .",

    "is that these coordinates are well suited for the specification of inner boundary conditions on a constant @xmath58 surface . because of these advantages we shall reserve the term `` adapted '' to a coordinate system for which constant @xmath58 surfaces near the source approximate spheres concentric with the source .",
    "a second feature of the tcbc coordinates that we shall also require in general , is that in the region far from the sources , @xmath58,@xmath59,@xmath60 asymptotically approach spherical coordinates , the coordinates best suited for describing the radiation field .",
