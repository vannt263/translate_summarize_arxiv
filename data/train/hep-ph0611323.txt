    "to understand the origin of fermion masses and flavor mixing is crucial and essential in modern particle physics .",

    "however , it remains unclear why the neutrino masses are quite suppressed compared to the other fermion masses . among various possible models ,",
    "the seesaw mechanism@xcite should be one of the most favorite mechanisms to explain the unnatural smallness of the neutrino mass scale . in the usual type - i seesaw mechanism , heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos are introduced to generate the light neutrino masses .",
    "the lepton - flavor - violating and lepton - number - violating processes , which are forbidden in the standard model ( sm ) , can also take place through the exchanges of heavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "besides the type - i seesaw scenario , the triplet seesaw mechanism@xcite , which extends the sm with one higgs triplet @xmath0 with hypercharge @xmath1 , gives another possible solution to the tiny light neutrino masses .",
    "such a higgs triplet can be introduced in many grand unified theories ( guts ) or @xmath2 theories .",
    "note that , in general the triplet seesaw model is more predictive than the usual type - i seesaw model , since there is no unknown right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the minimal version of the triplet seesaw models contains only one triplet besides the sm particles .",
    "that is very different from the type - i seesaw model , in which at least two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos are introduced to give rise to at least two massive left - handed neutrinos@xcite .    taking into account that most of the realistic triplet seesaw models are built at some energy scales @xmath3 much higher than the typical electroweak scale @xmath4@xcite , it is very meaningful to consider the radiative corrections to the neutrino mixing parameters . in the energy scales below the seesaw scale ,",
    "the running of the dimension-5 operator has been considered by many authors@xcite in the type - i seesaw framework , and it has been proved that there is no remarkable corrections in the sm or minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with small @xmath5 . however , in the energy scales above the triplet seesaw scale , the renormalization group equations ( rges ) are quite different from those in the low energy effective theory , and the rge analyses are still lacking in that energy scale . since the rge running may bring significant corrections to the physical parameters , it is very important for both model building and phenomenology to study the running effects from the gut scale ( @xmath6 ) to the seesaw scale .    in this letter , we derive a full set of one - loop rges in the framework of the sm extended with one heavy higgs triplet .",
