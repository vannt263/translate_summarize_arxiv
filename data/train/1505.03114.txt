    "recent progress in understanding the electronic wave functions of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) has led to an ability to synthesize isolated , quantum confined building blocks with a variety of tailored optical properties .",
    "quantum dots composed of silicon ( siqds ) seem particularly promising going forward for many biomedical , display , computing and solar energy applications .",
    "this is because they are environmentally benign , resource plentiful and benefit from decades of industrial know - how .",
    "siqds have been shown to carry out multiple - exciton generation ( meg ) , @xcite efficiently transport excitons,@xcite have higher coupling for same surface - to - surface separation,@xcite are free of defects@xcite and resist oxidation better@xcite ; siqds encapsulated within an inorganic amorphous matrix@xcite and within an organic polymer blend@xcite for photovoltaic application has been studied .    for many applications , such as light emission,@xcite optical computing,@xcite , and biomedical imaging , sensing and",
    "treatments,@xcite carrier transport is not a primary concern . within the solar energy arena ,",
    "though , quantum dots solids need to exhibit efficient carrier dynamics.@xcite transport of energy and charge is now a central issue in realizing the mesoscopic potential of quantum dot solids .",
    "this is a critical bottleneck because charge and exciton transport tend to proceed via low mobility , incoherent hopping associated with polaronic trapping and weak electronic coupling .    for quantum dot solids in which excitons readily dissociate ,",
    "a number of promising strategies seek to improve charge transport by focusing on properties such as translational symmetry , electronic overlap , matrix encapsulation , and crystalline orientation .",
    "dynamics within materials composed of small siqds , though , tend to be dominated by the motion of excitons though .",
    "while quantum confinement in siqds offers benefits , such as a pseudo - direct gap and high emission cross section , it also results in a low dielectric constant .",
    "this implies low screening and a high excitonic binding energy so that assemblies of siqds support excitons with a frenkel character .",
    "their dissociation is sufficiently problematic to motivate a consideration of ways in which the excitons themselves can be used to efficiently conduct energy .",
    "this is reminiscent of exciton transport that is efficiently carried out in photosynthetic complexes , offering either biomimetic or bio - inspired solution strategies .    in an ideal assembly of such dots , photon absorption results in a coherent superposition of frenkel excitons that will subsequently exhibit ballistic travel through the quantum dot solid . in reality , though , such coherence and the associated wavelike transport is rapidly lost .",
    "this is because the photoexcitation of a quantum dot shifts its equilibrium geometry and the dot shape will reorganize into a new configuration , as shown in figure [ distort ] .",
    "the energy change associated with such a relaxation is a measure of exciton - phonon entanglement known as the reorganization energy , @xmath0 .",
    "such exciton - photon entanglement destroys the quantum phase coherence among the excitonic superposition , and transport reduces to a diffusive random walk of excitonic states with a statistical distribution of occupation probabilities .    .",
    "ground state structure ( left ) relaxes into a new structure ( right ) when promoted into one of its degenerate first excited singlet states . as a result , the dot contracts along the vertical axis .",
    "the displacement is magnified 5 times in order to make this distortion clear.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in the absence of any structural disorder , this reduction to diffusive motion results in a slower rate of excitonic transport .",
    "the coherent wave packet , though , can quickly become trapped in naturally occurring disordered regions@xcite , so that the reduction to diffusive transport may improve the overall transport rate in realistic qd solids .",
    "intriguingly , it may be possible to combine the best of both transport regimes so that a superposition of frenkel excitons moves in a _ partially coherent _ manner .",
    "inspiration for such a goal comes from photosynthetic complexes@xcite wherein proteins and pigments are exquisitely structured so the rate of phonon entanglement is slow and the hopping transport is high  prerequisites for exciton transport with a degree of wave - like character@xcite . at issue is whether or not such a balance can be achieved in qd solids .",
    "first consider the hamiltonian of an isolated quantum dot , restricted to be in either its ground state , referenced to zero energy , or first excited singlet state with energy , @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath2 is the dimensional ( @xmath3 ) amplitude operator of vibrational mode @xmath4 with associated momentum operator @xmath5 , their non - dimensional counterparts are given by @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonian is then @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fermionic exciton annihilation operator and the equilibrium amplitude operator of each vibrational mode is @xmath10 .",
    "this can be re - grouped and simplified , using the bosonic phonon annihilation operator , @xmath11 , into components associated with excitonic site energy , @xmath12 , phonon energy , @xmath13 , reorganization energy , @xmath14 , and exciton - photon coupling energy , @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 the reorganization energy ( figure [ pes ] ) in the position basis is therefore given by @xmath18 .",
    "huang - rhys factors are obtained by dividing its spectrally resolved components , @xmath19 , by @xmath20 .    .",
    "the excited state manifold is assumed to be a displaced version of its ground state counterpart.(right ) excited state surfaces depend on spin state as depicted for the pair of orbitals comprising an exciton.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this additive decomposition lends itself to a continuum description of the exciton - phonon coupling as a smooth function of vibrational frequency , @xmath21 known as the _ spectral density _ function .",
    "a broadened version of this function is approximated as a superposition of shifted drude - lorentz distributions:@xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 characterize the width and shift of the @xmath25 drude - lorentz peak respectively .",
    "the rate at which structural reorganization occurs following excitation can , in large measure , be anticipated by identifying two features of this distribution .",
    "this will be considered after constructing a hamiltonian that allows for exciton transport through an assembly of quantum dots .    as a computational expedient",
    ", each dot within an assembly can be treated as a lattice site , @xmath26 , within discrete meso - scale hamiltonian with a subscript:@xcite @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the coupling between the @xmath29 and @xmath30 sites .",
    "the character of exciton transport can be then delineated by the size of these coupling parameters relative to the associated reorganization energies .",
    "suppose all of the dots and and their couplings to be identical so that the assembly is characterized by single @xmath0 and @xmath31 values .",
    "then @xmath32 j leads to the the coherent transport dynamics of the redfield equation@xcite and @xmath33 j results in the incoherent , hopping transport of the f@xmath34rster equation @xcite .",
    "the intermediate case , wherein @xmath35 j , is the regime of partially coherent transport of interest here.@xcite    there exist two primary design challenges in creating quantum dots assemblies that exhibit partially coherent transport .",
    "the first is to reduce the reorganization energy , @xmath0 , as much as possible , taken on in the present investigation",
    ". the design of bridge assemblies with sufficiently high excitonic coupling , @xmath31 , will be the subject of a future work .",
    "the reorganization energy of quantum dots can be reduced by either disrupting or constraining the exciton - phonon interaction because this mediates the structural response to electronic excitation .",
    "each idea is explored with two distinct approaches intended to demonstrate how such mitigation can be designed into quantum dot solids with the aim of enabling partially coherent transport .",
    "it is not sufficient to simply reduce the reorganization energy , though , as the shape of the spectral density , @xmath36 , has a strong influence on the rate , @xmath37 , at which the excitonic superposition loses phase coherence .",
    "this can be elucidated by considering a siqd dimer , @xcite for which this decoherence rate can be expressed as sum of a pure dephasing , @xmath38 , and a relaxation , @xmath39 : @xmath40 here @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the energy difference between two siqds , @xmath43 is the thermally weighted spectral density , and @xmath44 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the dephasing expression determines the rate of decay of off - diagonal elements of the density operator after tracing over all of the phonon states .",
    "in contrast , the relaxation expression corresponds to the population transfer between eigenstates of the relevant system that are accompanied by energy dissipation into the phonon reservoir .    if the two qds are identical in this dimer system the pure dephasing rate eq .",
    "[ rd ] would be zero since @xmath45 so that the decoherence rate is determined solely by the relaxation rate of eq .",

    "the rate of decoherence is proportional to the spectral density at a vibrational energy equal to the excitonic coupling , @xmath31 .",
    "it is therefore important to suppress , as much as possible , the spectral density for vibrations in this range .    for nonzero @xmath46 ,",
    "on the other hand , the decoherence rate is the sum of rate eq .",
    "[ rd ] and eq .",
    "[ rr ] . in that case ,",
    "the pure dephasing rate is proportional to the slope of the spectral density.@xcite this implies that a spectral density with a dearth of exciton - phonon coupling at the low - energy end of the vibrational spectrum will result in a flat character there and a small slope at the origin .",
    "both of these key characteristics of the spectral density are illustrated in figure [ spectral_density_schematic ] .",

    "all ground state structures were optimized using density functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in dmol.@xcite an all - electron approach was used with exchange and correlation effects accounted for by the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) parameterized by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite for siqds and hybrid b3lyp@xcite for organic molecules . a real - space",

    ", a @xmath49scf method was employed because it is no more computationally expensive than a small set of ground state dft calculations .",

    "imposed on the structure of the density , self - consistent field ( scf ) iteration is then carried out on eq .",
    "[ ks ] as usual , hence the name @xmath49scf . both accuracy and the rate of convergence can be improved , though , by performing this scf iteration using a density operator comprised of the lowest @xmath53 orbitals and a linear combination of unoccupied orbitals.@xcite this is especially important when there is degeneracy at or near the homo or lumo .",
    "our highly symmetric quantum dots typically exhibit such degeneracies , so we use @xmath55 as the @xmath56 and @xmath54 kohn - sham orbital , where @xmath57 is the degeneracy of corresponding state . carrying out iteration process of eq . with this",
    "modified density results in the franck - condon excitation energy , point a in the left panel of figure [ pes ] . to calculate the reorganization energy , a geometry optimization",
    "was subsequently performed to obtain point b in the left panel of figure [ pes ] .",
    "this approach does not address the excited state spin , though , which must be antisymmetric ( singlet ) , and some care must be taken to estimate this properly .",
    "we first assume that all @xmath58 orbitals are spin restricted so that the promotion of a kohn - sham particle from orbital @xmath58 to orbital @xmath59 implies that the spin state is determined by particles in orbitals @xmath53 and @xmath59 .",
    "these two orbitals can then be used to construct the requisite singlet wave function : @xmath60 as is typical in electronic structure codes , though , it is not possible to assign such a superposition of spin pairs directly .",
    "however , the excited singlet state can also be written as @xmath61 where the triplet spin states are @xmath62 this implies that the desired excited state singlet energy surface , @xmath63 , ( green curve in both panels of figure [ pes ] ) can be constructed from the degenerate triplet surface , @xmath64 , ( red curve in right panel ) and that of state @xmath65 ( blue curve in right panel):@xcite @xmath66 the energy difference between points a and b of on this constructed singlet surface is the reorganization energy , @xmath0 .",
    "since the entirety of this curve is not available in practice , though , we approximate the reorganization energy as the difference between @xmath67 and @xmath68 on the @xmath69 surface ( blue ) but also calculate @xmath70 and @xmath71 on the triplet surface ( red ) for comparison . note that an analogous approach , building the desired energy surface out of those associated with @xmath72 and @xmath73 , will not yield an energy relation analogous to eq .",

    ", a vibrational ( hessian ) analysis is performed on the ground state structures and the displacement associated with reorganization is expressed as a linear combination of the phonon modes .",
    "anharmonic corrections are also required for the smallest dots ( @xmath75 ) but were found to be negligibly small for all larger sizes .",

    "reduction in the coupling itself can be accomplished most simply by spreading out the electronic excitation over more atoms , for instance by increasing dot size .",
    "the reorganization energy , @xmath0 , was found to be inversely proportional to the cube of the dot diameter , @xmath79 , and a simple relationship was identified : @xmath80 with @xmath79 in nm and @xmath0 in mev . since having a small dot size is important for better transport , fewer defects and easier functionalization , though , a second way of reducing exciton - phonon coupling was also explored .",
    "dots were functionalized so that the frontier orbitals , of which excitons are primarily comprised , are not the bonding orbitals that generate phonons . this idea has been successfully demonstrated for small organic molecules , and it is also underlies the efficiency of lanthanide nanoparticles in efficiently carrying out excitonic energy transfer upconversions.@xcite our analysis indicates that this is also possible for siqds using cl atoms  not because cl is considered a candidate functionalization but to demonstrate proof of the concept . for the smallest dots , a drop in reorganization from 494 mev to 67 mev resulted",
    "this is a surface effect , however , and further reduction in reorganization energy is minimal as dot size is increased .",
    "the second design paradigm is to constrain the system so that it can not carry out the structural re - arrangements that generate reorganization energy .",
    "this was first explored by controlling the hydrogenation of dot surfaces which can be carried out by changing the partial pressure of hydrogen in the environment.@xcite the results indicate the reorganization energy is significantly reduced as a result of what amounts to a stiff skin on the surface of the dot that resists the driving force to reorganize . as with the standard h - terminated dots , this reorganization energy decreases with increasing dot size , and 17 mev was the minimum value computationally measured .",
    "matrix encapsulation is also a promising avenue for reducing the motion that generates the reorganization energy well .",
    "a monolayer of @xmath81 around @xmath82 reduced @xmath0 from 271 mev to 161 mev and freezing the h - atoms on the dot surface dropped this value down to only 36 mev .",
    "this computational study of 1 - 2 nm silicon quantum dots is not focused on reducing excitonic reorganization energy as much as possible .",
    "rather , it identifies ways in which this energy can be reduced in order to offer direction to future work .",
    "even so , the results suggest that it is reasonable to identify a goal of creating 1 - 2 nm silicon quantum dots with reorganization values in the range of 1 - 10 mev .",
    "this overlays the range typically considered in association with photosynthetic complexes of 0.1 to 10 mev@xcite  naturally occurring assemblies that serve as a bio - inspiration for what may be improved upon with engineered organic / inorganic nanostructures.@xcite more important than the range itself , though , successful designs will need to produce excitonic coupling of the same order or larger to create quantum dot solids with a measure of wave - like character .",
