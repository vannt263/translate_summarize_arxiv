    "multiple astrophysical and cosmological observations have demonstrated that a significant fraction of the matter content of the universe is in the form of new particles not included in the standard model , but belonging to the so - called dark sector ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the dark matter ( dm ) particles were presumably produced during the very early stages of the universe and must have a relic abundance today @xmath0  @xcite . among the various production mechanisms proposed , the freeze - out mechanism stands among the most appealing and predictive ones . in this framework ,",
    "the dark matter particles were in thermal equilibrium with the standard model particles at very early times , but went out of equilibrium when the temperature reached a value @xmath1 .",
    "below this temperature , the expansion rate became larger than the annihilation rate and therefore the number density of dark matter particles per comoving volume remained practically constant until today , the value being inversely proportional to their annihilation cross section into standard model particles .",
    "the annihilations that lead to the freeze - out of dark matter particles in the early universe presumably continue today , at a much smaller rate , in regions with high dark matter density , such as in galactic centers .",
    "there exists then the possibility of testing the freeze - out mechanism if the flux of energetic particles produced in the annihilations is detected at the earth .",
    "unfortunately , the expected flux from annihilations is typically much smaller than the background fluxes from astrophysical processes , which makes a potential signal difficult to disentangle from the still poorly understood backgrounds .",
    "a promising strategy to identify a dark matter signal is the search for sharp gamma - ray spectral features , such as gamma - ray lines  @xcite , internal electromagnetic bremsstrahlung  @xcite or gamma - ray boxes  @xcite .",
    "most dark matter models predict rather faint sharp spectral features , however , the predicted signatures are qualitatively very different to the ones expected from known astrophysical processes , thus allowing a very efficient background subtraction . as a result , searches for sharp gamma - ray spectral features provide limits on the model parameters which are competitive , and sometimes better , than those from other approaches to indirect dark matter detection .",
    "recent works have thoroughly investigated the generation of sharp gamma - ray spectral features in simplified models , as well as the complementarity of the searches for spectral features with other search strategies , in scenarios where the dark matter particle is a majorana fermion that couples to a standard model fermion via a yukawa coupling @xcite , or in the inert doublet dark matter model  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the generation of sharp gamma - ray spectral features in the toy model of real scalar dark matter considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the standard model is extended with a real singlet scalar @xmath2 , candidate for dark matter , and an exotic vector - like fermion @xmath3 , which mediates the interactions with the standard model fermions . in this model ,",
    "the stability of the dark matter particle is ensured by imposing a discrete @xmath4 symmetry , under which @xmath2 and @xmath3 are odd while the standard model particles are even .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the new sector only couples to a right - handed lepton of one generation , @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 , in order to suppress potential contributions to lepton flavor violating processes such as @xmath8 . under these simplifying assumptions",
    "the interaction lagrangian of the dark matter particle with the standard model particles reads : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the standard model higgs doublet .",
    "this model has the peculiarity that the cross section for the tree - level two - to - two annihilation process @xmath11 , which sets the relic abundance over large regions of the parameter space , is d - wave suppressed in the limit @xmath12 .",
    "on the other hand , the processes generating gamma - ray lines at the one loop level @xmath13 or internal bremsstrahlung @xmath14 proceed in the s - wave .",
    "therefore , for values of the parameters leading to the correct relic abundance , the expected indirect detection signals are relatively large compared to other models and , under some conditions , at the reach of present instruments  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : gamma - ray ]",
    "we present the result for the cross sections and we discuss the relative strength of both signals . in section [ sec : constraints ] we present constraints on the model from perturbativity , thermal production , direct detection , indirect detection with charged cosmic rays and collider experiments . in section [ sec : numerics ] we present a numerical analysis showing the complementarity of all these constraints , under the assumption that the dark matter particle was thermally produced .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the gamma - ray flux generated by the annihilation of scalar dark matter particles receives several contributions . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the generation of sharp gamma - ray spectral features , which , if observed , would constitute a strong hint for dark matter annihilations .",
    "we will neglect , however , the gamma - ray emission generated by the inverse compton scattering of the electrons / positrons produced in the annihilation on the interstellar radiation field , and will only briefly discuss the gamma - rays produced by the decay and hadronization of higgs or gauge bosons since they do not generate sharp features in the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "the scalar @xmath2 does not have tree - level electromagnetic interactions .",
    "nevertheless , annihilations into one or two photons are possible via higher order effects mediated by the standard model fermion @xmath15 and the exotic fermion @xmath3 , which do carry electroweak charges .",
    "more specifically , the interaction lagrangian with photons of the charged fermions of the model reads : @xmath16 while the interaction lagrangian with the @xmath17 boson reads : @xmath18    the annihilations @xmath19 and @xmath20 are generated at the one loop level , through the diagrams shown in fig .",

    "as mentioned above , for ( moderately ) small mass splittings @xmath62 between the fermionic mediator and the scalar dark matter particle , the two - to - three process has the largest cross section , while for @xmath55 the one loop processes dominate the annihilation .",

    "[ fig : vib_vs_loop ] , top plots , where we show the annihilation cross sections for the relevant processes as a function of the dark matter mass for @xmath63 ( left plot ) and for @xmath64 ( right plot ) .",
    "it is important to note that the values of the cross section when the loop processes dominate are fairly small .",
    "however , this does not imply that the one loop processes can be neglected in this model . as we will show below",
    ", gamma - ray lines can dominate the total gamma - ray energy spectrum , even for smaller values of @xmath51 , due to the sharpness of the gamma - ray line signal compared to the internal bremsstrahlung signal and the fairly good energy resolution of present gamma - ray telescopes , @xmath65 .",

    "it is interesting that the gamma - ray lines give a significant contribution to the spectrum for @xmath69 and totally dominate the high energy part of the spectrum when @xmath70 , despite the smaller cross section .",
    "therefore , in the search for gamma - ray spectral features the contribution from gamma - ray lines ought not to be neglected .",
    "the relative importance of the gamma - ray lines will increase with the next generation of gamma - ray telescopes , such as gamma-400  @xcite and dampe  @xcite , that aim to an energy resolution of @xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "the possibility of observing a spectral feature in the gamma - ray sky arising from scalar dark matter annihilations is subject to a series of theoretical and observational constraints . in this section ,",
    "we discuss each of these constraints individually , while we will study their complementarity in section  [ sec : numerics ] , along with the results of the searches for gamma - ray spectral features .",
    "demanding perturbativity of the model translates into an upper bound on the yukawa coupling @xmath59 .",

    "[ fig : lambda_finite ] by the ( nearly ) vertical gray shaded strips . in particular , it is impossible to obtain the observed relic density for dark matter masses around @xmath151 gev , even for very small values of @xmath95 , due to the resonantly enhanced annihilation processes mediated by the exchange of a higgs particle in the s - channel .",
    "it follows from fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda_finite ] an interesting complementarity between direct detection and collider constraints on the one hand , and searches for gamma - ray spectral features on the other hand : the lux experiment and the lhc constrain the model for dark matter masses below @xmath152 gev ( depending on the value of @xmath95 ) , while the fermi - lat and h.e.s.s .",
    "provide the strongest constraints for larger dark matter masses .",
    "interestingly , some regions of the parameter space have been probed both by direct and indirect searches ( and in some cases also by collider searches ) .",
    "the non observation of a dark matter signal then allows to more robustly exclude that part of the parameter space , in spite of the astrophysical uncertainties that plague the calculation of the direct and indirect detection rates .",
    "conversely , some regions of the parameter space will be probed in the next years both by the xenon1 t experiment and by cta , thus opening the exciting possibility of observing dark matter signals in more than one experiment .",
    "we have studied the generation of sharp gamma - ray spectral features in a toy model consisting in a scalar particle as dark matter candidate , that couples to a heavy exotic vector - like fermion and a standard model fermion via a yukawa coupling .",
    "more specifically , we have calculated the cross section for the processes generating gamma - ray lines at the one loop level and generating line - like features through the two - to - three annihilation into two standard model fermions with the associated emission of a gauge boson .",
    "we have showed that the cross section for the two - to - three process is larger than for the loop annihilation when the fermionic mediator is degenerate in mass with the dark matter particle , the importance of the latter increasing as the ratio between the mediator mass and the dark matter mass becomes larger and larger .",
    "we have also calculated the expected intensity of the sharp spectral features for a dark matter population produced via the freeze - out mechanism . in this model ,",
    "the annihilation cross section into a fermion - antifermion pair proceeds in the d - wave , therefore reproducing the correct relic abundance via thermal production requires a rather large yukawa coupling , which in turn translates into relatively intense indirect detection signals .",
    "in fact , we find that large parts of the parameter space are already excluded by the fermi - lat and h.e.s.s .",
    "searches for line - like features .",
    "we have also investigated the limits on the model from other indirect dark matter searches , direct searches and collider searches , and we have discussed the complementarity of these limits with those from the non - observation of sharp features in the gamma - ray sky .",
    "during the completion of this work , we learned about an analysis of gamma - ray spectral features in the scalar dark matter model @xcite .",
    "their results agree with ours , in the aspects where our analyses overlap .",
    "we are grateful to federica giacchino , laura lopez - honorez and michel tytgat for communications and for sharing with us the results of @xcite .",
    "we also thank celine boehm and stefan vogl for useful discussions .",
