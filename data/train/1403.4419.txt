    "we consider models for populations whose intermingling may be beneficial to both of them , harmful for both of them , or beneficial for one and detrimental for the other one .",
    "the classical models always assume individualistic behavior of each population , see e.g. part i of @xcite .",
    "new models for mimicking the herd group defense of herbivores have been recently introduced , @xcite , differing quite a bit from older ideas relying on different assumptions , @xcite , or from more recent contributions , @xcite , in which the word `` group '' is used with a completely different meaning , or at least it is mathematically modeled in a completely different way from ours .",
    "furthermore , the biological literature abounds on social , herd or pack behaviour , but these concepts are either not the same that are considered here or modeled via different mathematical tools , e.g. graph theory or game theory , than those employed here , see for instance @xcite and the wealth of literature that is cited in these papers .",
    "although @xcite deals with a demographic model , an extension to ecoepidemic systems has been proposed , @xcite .",
    "these kind of systems consider basic population interactions , on which the effects of epidemics are superimposed . in the past twenty years",
    "a great deal of research effort has been devoted to their understanding , for a brief introduction , see chapter 7 of @xcite .",
    "these investigations represent a natural outgrowth of the developments of the late nineties in mathematical epidemiology , when the effects of population changes began to be accounted for in models for the spreading of diseases , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we confine ourselves to the pure demographic situation , however .",
    "we extend the community gathering idea also to predators , allowing them to hunt the prey in a coordinate fashion .",
    "thus the models we consider markedly differ from those of @xcite , in the biological assumptions and above all in the mathematical structure .",
    "in fact , this is not a mere extension of previous work to different population associations , because the predators are behaving individualistically in @xcite and therefore predator s pack behavior is absent in those models .",
    "when the predators pack hunts the prey in general the individuals that have the major benefit are those that either take the most advantageous positions in the community in order to get the best share of the loot , or simply those that get it because they are stronger .",
    "assume therefore that positions on the edge of the pack have the best returns for the individuals that occupy them , since they are the first to fall upon the prey .",
    "the main idea of community behaviors for predators had been considered in @xcite . in the framework of animals socialized behavior these ideas",
    "have recently been discussed also in @xcite and carried over to ecoepidemic systems , @xcite .",
    "we consider two situations for the prey , namely when they behave individualistically or when they gather in herds , following the assumptions of @xcite . in the latter situation , the most harmed prey during predators hunting",
    "are those staying on the boundary of the herd .    here",
    "we also extend this concept to more general types of interactions among populations thriving in the same environment .",
    "the cases of symbiosis and competition are also well - known in the literature .",
    "again , the classical approach envisions an individualistic behavior for the involved populations . in part",
    "this idea has been introduced in @xcite , but assuming that only one population behaves socially , the individuals of the other one live independently of each other .",
    "we extend now the analysis to the case in which both populations show a community behavior , both when each one of the two communities benefits from the interactions with the other one , as well as the case in which the communities compete with each other .",
    "the systems introduced here mathematically model the interactions occurring on the edge of the pack via suitable nonlinear functions of the populations in place of the classical bilinear terms coming from the mass action law .",
    "these are therefore gompertz - like interaction terms , with a fixed exponent , whose value is @xmath0 .",
    "its value comes from its geometric meaning , it represents the fact that the perimeter of the patch occupied by the population is one - dimensional , while the patch itself is two - dimensional , as explained in detail below in section 2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section discusses the model formulation .",
    "section 3 contains the various dynamical systems , their adimensionalizations , some mathematical preliminaries and the analysis of the equilibria in which one or more populations are absent .",
    "each of the following sections investigates instead the coexistence equilibrium respectively for the cases of symbiosis , the two predator - prey cases and competition .",
    "a final discussion concludes the paper .",
    "the basic ideas underlying modeling herd behavior have been expounded in @xcite . here",
    "we recall the main steps for the benefit of the reader . consider a population that gathers together .",
    "let @xmath1 represent its size .",
    "if this population lives on a certain territory of size @xmath2 , the number of individuals staying at the outskirts of the pack is directly related to the length of the perimeter of the territory . therefore its length is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath1 is distributed over a two - dimensional domain , the density square root , i.e. @xmath4 will therefore count the individuals at the edge of the territory .",
    "now let us assume that another population @xmath5 intermingles with the one just considered .",
    "we assume that the interactions of the latter occur mainly via the individuals living at the periphery , so that the interaction term for each individual of the population @xmath5 must be proportional to @xmath4 . as a result ,",
    "if @xmath5 behaves individualistically , the interactions among the two populations are expressed by @xmath6 . alternatively ,",
    "if also @xmath5 gathers in herds , the interactions will occur at the edge of each bunch of individuals , and therefore will contain square root terms for both populations .",
    "they will thus be modeled via @xmath7 .",
    "interactions between population can be of different types .",
    "they can benefit both , in the case of symbiosis .",
    "alternatively they can damage both populations , when they compete among themselves directly or for common resources .",
    "finally , one population receives an advantage from the other one ; this happens in the predator - prey situation .",
    "each of these possible configurations could be subject to pack behavior in one or both populations .",
    "the case of one population gathering in herds while the other one behaves individualistically has already been extensively dealt with in @xcite . with one exception , that involves pack predation and individual prey , not considered in @xcite , we will therefore concentrate on models involving both populations with individuals sticking together .",
    "let us denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 the sizes of two populations in consideration as functions of time @xmath10 . in all the models that follow ,",
    "the parameters bear the following meaning .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is the growth rate of the @xmath5 population , with @xmath12 or @xmath13 being its environment s carrying capacity , while , when meaningful , @xmath14 denotes the carrying capacity for the @xmath1 s .",
    "further , for the latter @xmath15 is the natural death rate when the @xmath1 s are interpreted as predators , models ( [ mod1 ] ) and ( [ mod2 ] ) , while it is once more a reproduction rate otherwise , i.e. in the symbiotic ( [ symb ] ) and competing ( [ comp ] ) cases .",
    "interaction rates between the two populations are denoted by parameter @xmath16 for the @xmath5 population and by @xmath17 for the @xmath1 s .",
    "the following systems will be considered , in which all the parameters are assumed to be nonnegative .",
    "the symbiotic situation @xmath18 the predator - prey interactions of pack - individualistic type , for a specialized predator @xmath19 the pack predation - herd defense system , for a specialized predator @xmath20 and finally the competing case @xmath21    note that when considering predator - prey interactions we need to impose that @xmath22 , since not the whole prey is converted in food for the predators .      as remarked in @xcite",
    ", singularities could arise in the systems jacobians when one or both populations vanish . for the models ( [ symb ] ) and ( [ comp ] ) we define new variables as follows @xmath23 as well as new adimensionalized parameters @xmath24 therefore the adimensionalized systems read , for ( [ symb ] ) @xmath25 while for ( [ comp ] ) we find @xmath26    for the predator - prey cases",
    "( [ mod1 ] ) and ( [ mod2 ] ) the substitutions differ slightly .",
    "rescaling for the model ( [ mod1 ] ) is obtained through @xmath27 and defining the new parameters @xmath28 the adimensionalized system can be written as @xmath29 while in absence of predators , the system reduces just to the first equation . in this case , easily , the prey follow a logistic growth , toward the adimensionalized carrying capacity @xmath30 .    for ( [ mod2 ] )",
    "we have instead @xmath31 define now the adimensionalized parameters @xmath32 the adimensionalized system for @xmath33 becomes @xmath34    note that all the new adimensionalized parameters are combinations of the old nonnegative parameters @xmath11 , @xmath15 , @xmath17 , @xmath16 , @xmath12 ; as a consequence , they must be nonnegative as well .      for the later analysis of the equilibria stability it is imperative to consider the jacobians of these systems .",
    "we find the following matrices respectively , for ( [ adim ] ) @xmath35 and for ( [ adimc ] ) @xmath36    considering the predator - prey cases , for ( [ mod1s ] ) the jacobian is @xmath37 while the one for ( [ mod2s ] ) reads @xmath38      with this `` geometric '' expression we denote the equilibria in which at least one population vanishes .",
    "in fact , they lie on the boundary of the feasible region of the phase plane , the first quadrant .",
    "they need a special care in these kinds of group behavior models , because in eliminating the singularity we divide by @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "therefore all the simplified models ( [ adim])-([mod2s ] ) hold for strictly positive populations .",
    "if one population vanishes , no information can gathered by the latter , we rather have to turn to the original formulations ( [ symb])-([comp ] ) .",
    "if one of the two populations disappears the system reduces to one equation . in this circumstance",
    "the surviving population follows a logistic growth toward its own carrying capacity for the models ( [ symb ] ) and ( [ comp ] ) . the same occurs for the prey in absence of predators in models ( [ mod1 ] ) and ( [ mod2 ] ) . in these models when prey are absent",
    ", the predators can not survive .",
    "in fact when @xmath41 the equation for the predators shows that they exponentially decay to zero .",
    "this makes sense biologically , since these are specialistic predators .",
    "thus in these two models the disappearance of both populations is a possibility .    more generally , the equilibrium corresponding to populations collapse is the origin .",
    "its stability can be analysed by a simple linearization of the govering equations .    for ( [ symb ] )",
    "we find @xmath42 thus symbiotic populations can not both vanish .    for competition , ( [ comp ] )",
    ", there is a sign change , for which @xmath43 in this case the two populations may disappear , when @xmath44    for the predator - prey cases , ( [ mod1 ] ) leads to @xmath45 so that again the equilibrium is unstable .    in the case ( [ mod2 ] )",
    "instead we find @xmath46 here again both populations under unfavorable circumstances may well disappear , and this happens when @xmath47",
    "in view of the preliminary results of section [ sec : b_e ] here as well as in what follows , we investigate the coexistence of both populations for the simplified models .",
    "looking for the coexistence equilibria we are led to the ninth degree equation @xmath48=0\\ ] ] which does not lead to significant results .",
    "however , we then consider a graphical analysis of the system of equations originated by ( [ adim ] ) .",

    "the @xmath39 nullcline corresponds to the blue continuous curve @xmath49 , conversely the @xmath40 nullcline corresponds to the red dashed function @xmath50 .",
    "the phase plane of interest is obviously only the set @xmath51 .",
    "the figure is obtained for the following parameter values @xmath52 ,",

    "some of the intersections in the second and fourth quadrant may disappear .",
    "but we are only interested in nonnegative populations @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in view of the behavior of the cubic functions",
    ", there will always exist a real intersection between these two functions in the first quadrant .",
    "moreover , this intersection is unique , leading to the coexistence equilibrium @xmath61 .",
    "no hopf bifurcations can arise at the coexistence equilibrium .",
    "* proof*. to have hopf bifurcations , we need purely imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "this occurs when the trace of the jacobian vanishes and simultaneously the determinant is positive , i.e. @xmath62 it can be easily seen that solving for @xmath63 from the first condition and substituting into the second one , we find @xmath64 which is a contradiction .",
    "the trajectories of the system ( [ adim ] ) are ultimately bounded .",
    "@xmath65 is globally asympotically stable .",
    "* proof*. we follow @xcite and just outline the proof .",
    "it is enough to take a large enough box @xmath66 in the first quadrant that contains the coexistence equilibrium . on the vertical and on the horizontal sides",
    "it is easy to show that the dynamical system s flow enters into the box .",
    "the axes can not be crossed , on biological grounds .",
    "mathematically however , the square root singularity prevents the right hand side of the dynamical system to be lipschitz continuous when the corresponding population vanishes , so that the assumption for the uniqueness theorem fails on the axes .",
    "but as mentioned in the model formulation , we understand that the differential equations hold only in the interior of the first quadrant , on the coordinate axes they are replaced by corresponding equations in which the vanishing population is removed . thus @xmath66 is a positively invariant set , from which the first claim follows . by the poincar - bendixson theorem , since there are no limit cycles , the coexistence equilibrium must be globally asymptotically stable .",
    "the results of the classical case , @xmath67 are summarized in @xcite .",

    "the coexistence equilibrium @xmath71 is unconditionally stable when feasible , i.e. @xmath72 . note that if @xmath73 is infeasible the trajectories are unbounded , which is biologically scarcely possible in view of the environment s limited resources .",
    "we now compare the classical model with ( [ adim ] ) in order to understand how socialization may boost the mutual benefit of the system s populations .",

    "this makes sense , since in symbiotic models the benefit comes from the mutual interactions between populations . if the latter are scattered in the environment it is more likely for each individual of one population to get in contact with one of the other . on the other hand , when herd behaviour is exhibited",

    "we consider also the classical model with logistic correction .",
    "if we rescale it , however , since it does not contain the square root terms , we would find a different adimensionalization , rendering the comparison difficult .",
    "thus we rather return to the original formulations ( [ mod1 ] ) and ( [ mod2 ] ) .    the classical lotka - volterra model with logistic correction for the prey",
    ", @xmath174 has two attainable equilibria : the prey - only equilibrium @xmath175 , from which via a transcritical bifurcation at @xmath176 coexistence @xmath177 arises , feasible for @xmath178 and always stable .",
    "its explicit representation follows , together with the one of coexistence for the system with individualistic hunting and prey herd response , @xcite , in dimensionalized form , @xmath179 the dimensional form of the coexistence equilibria of the two models presented here , respectively for ( [ mod1 ] ) and ( [ mod2 ] ) are @xmath180    the equilibrium prey populations of the first two models depend only on the system parameters @xmath15 and @xmath17 , i.e. the predators mortality and predation efficiency .",
    "thus they are independent of their own reproductive capabilities and of the environment carrying capacity .",
    "further , when the predators hunting efficiency is larger than the predators own mortality , i.e. @xmath181 , the equilibrium prey value is much lower if they gather in herds , i.e. in @xmath182 , while on the contrary the predators attain instead higher values , again at @xmath182 .",
    "conversely , when @xmath183 the prey grouping together , @xmath182 , allows higher equilibrium numbers than for their individualistic behavior ; the predators instead settle at lower values if the prey use a defensive strategy , @xmath182 , and higher ones with individualistic prey behavior , at @xmath177 .    for ( [ mod1 ] ) and ( [ mod2 ] ) , i.e. with coordinated hunting",
    ", these values involve also the prey own intrinsic characteristics .",
    "in particular for ( [ mod2 ] ) the ratio of the predators hunting efficiency @xmath17 versus their mortality @xmath15 determines if the predators at equilibrium will be more than the prey , see @xmath114 .",
    "a similar result possibly extends for the model of pack hunting coupled with loose prey , ( [ mod1 ] ) , but at @xmath92 the predators population at equilibrium contains the prey population squared and in principle the latter may not exceed @xmath184 , so that the conclusion would not be immediate . indeed , at the equilibria @xmath92 and @xmath114 , the prey populations are the multiplication of the fractions in the brackets , always smaller than @xmath184 , by the carrying capacity @xmath12 , which may or not be large .",
    "the result could indeed give a population smaller than @xmath184 .",
    "this in principle is not a contradiction , because the population need not necessarily be counted by individuals , but rather its size could be measured by the weight of its biomass .",
    "we now deal with ( [ comp ] ) in the rescaled version ( [ adimc ] ) .",
    "the coexistence equilibria are the roots of the eighth degree equation @xmath185 a better interpretation treats the problem as an intersection of cubic functions , @xmath186}(x)=b(1-x^2)x , \\quad x_{[2]}(y)=\\frac{c}{a}(1-y^2)y.\\ ] ] depending on the behavior of the cubic functions , there could be either three intersections ( the origin and one each in the second and fourth quadrants ) or five ( the previous ones and one more in the first and third quadrants ) , or nine .",

    ", we have found here that in presence of community behavior of both populations , the same occurs , but there is another possibility , namely tristability . when the conditions arise , the coexistence equilibrium may be present together with the equilibria in which one population vanishes .",
    "therefore the system s outcome is once more determined by the initial conditions , but this time the phase plane is partitioned into three basins of attractions , corresponding each to one of the possible equilibria .",
    "it would be interesting to compute explicitly the boundary of each one of them .",
    "for this task an extension of the algorithms presented in @xcite would be needed .",
    "we now compare the population levels when a coexistence equilibrium is stable in both classical and new model .",
    "considering the parameters @xmath237 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 , with suitable initial conditions , the behavior of the two models is shown in figure [ compare_competition ] . from the same initial conditions , trajectories of the two models evolve toward different equilibria .    , @xmath263 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 , @xmath266 , @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath59 , @xmath269 .",

    "the population levels are thus higher in the herd model , at @xmath270 and @xmath271 while for the classic model we find @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "this is not surprising for the same reasons for which the opposite behavior occurs in the symbiotic models . in herd models ,",
    "only individuals at the outskirts meet individual of the other species .",
    "this means that individuals at the centre of the flock here receive less harm from the competition . on the contrary , in the classic model",
    ", individuals of the two populations are mixed together , so that the whole populations are harmed by the competition .",
    "we have presented four models for non - classical population interactions , in that the populations involved in some way exhibit a socialized way of living .",
    "this investigation completes the one undertaken in @xcite , in that all the situations that are possible in terms of individualistic or gathering populations behavior are now analysed .",
    "the models missing in @xcite are presented here : we allow predators to hunt in packs , as well as both intermingling populations to gather together , in the two cases of symbiosis and competition , so that they interact not on an individualistic basis , but rather is some coordinate fashion .",
    "the newly introduced symbiotic model on a qualitative basis behaves like the classical one .",
    "the populations settle always at the coexistence equilibrium .",
    "only , their levels are quantitatively smaller than in the classical case since the mutually beneficial interactions in the new model are somewhat reduced .    for predator - prey interactions in presence of predators pack hunting , we may have the prey behave in herds or individualistically . the most prominent discrepancy between these two cases",
    "is the fact that both populations may disappear , under specific unfortunate conditions , when the prey use a defensive coordinate strategy .",
    "this does not happen instead if they move loose in the environment , i.e. exhibit individualistic behavior , since they attain a coexistence equilibrium .",
    "this finding is quite counterintuitive , because it could imply that the defensive mechanism is ineffective . but",
    "an interpretation could be provided , since herds are more easily spotted by predators than individuals who can more easily hide in the terrain configuration .",
    "once the prey herds are completely wiped out , the predators also will disappear , since they are assumed not to be generalist , i.e. their only food source is the prey under consideration .",
    "ecosystem extinction has also been rarely observed in the model without pack predation , @xcite .",
    "the system with prey herd behavior also shows limit cycles , i.e. the populations can coexist also through persistent oscillations , not only at a stable equilibrium , which instead is the only possible system s outcome for the model with individualistic prey .",
    "a similar result had been discovered earlier in case of individualistic predators hunting , @xcite , constituting the major difference between the prey group defense model with uncoordinated predation and the classical predator - prey system . finally , on the quantitative side ,",
    "the coexistence population values for these two models with pack hunting differ , but without specific informations on the parameter values it is not possible to assess which system will provide higher population values .",
    "the competition system presented here allows again the extinction of both populations , under unfavorable circumstances , while this never happens for the classical model .",
    "ecosystem disappearance occurs when ( [ comp_disapp ] ) holds , a condition that in the nondimensional model is equivalent to @xmath193 , as stated in proposition 12 .",
    "when the competition system thrives , it does at higher levels for both populations than those achieved in the classical model .",
    "thus in this case populations coordinated behavior boosts their respective sizes , in case the system parameters are in the range for which coexistence occurs .",
    "but the major finding in this context of social behavior among all possible populations behavior is found for the competition case .",
    "indeed the system in suitable conditions can show the phenomenon of competitive exclusion as the classical model does , but in addition we have discovered that both populations can thrive , together with the situations predicted by the competitive exclusion principle .",
    "in other words , we have found that the rather simple model ( [ comp ] ) or ( [ adimc ] ) may exhibit tristability , see once more the right picture in figure [ fig : tri ] .",
