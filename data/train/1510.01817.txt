    "it was predicted by nielsen and ninomiya @xcite in the ultra - quantum regime of strong magnetic field , where only zeroth landau level is partially occupied .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the fact that in the presence of a magnetic field the electrons can be transferred between different weyl nodes by the spectral flow caused by the electric field parallel to the magnetic one .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that the strongly anisotropic magnetoresistance due to the chiral anomaly persists to the semiclassical regime of weak magnetic fields , where it can be described by the boltzmann kinetic equation .",
    "these effects are related to the `` chiral magnetic effect '' which may be observable in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .    recently in a series of remarkable experiments  @xcite a significant and strongly anisotropic magnetoresistance has been measured in a number of systems .",
    "it is negative for the case where the magnetic and electric fields are parallel and positive in the case when the electric and magnetic field are perpendicular .",
