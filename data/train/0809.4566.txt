    "this report contains an update on the values of the precision electroweak properties and fits within the context of the standard model ( sm ) , with respect to  @xcite , where more details can be found .",
    "the @xmath0 data are from the aleph , delphi , l3 and opal experiments at lep , and from the sld experiment at slac .",
    "all the lep1 results at the z - pole are final  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 data come from the cdf and d0 experiments at the tevatron , using integrated run 2 luminosities of up to 2.8 fb@xmath2 .",
    "the z - lepton couplings ( see  @xcite for definitions and details ) are extracted from the @xmath3 polarisation ( a@xmath4 , a@xmath5 ) , the slac polarised electron asymmetry @xmath6 ( a@xmath4 ) and the forward - backward asymmetries for leptons ( a@xmath7 , @xmath8=e,@xmath9 ) .",
    "the results are reasonably compatible with lepton universality and , assuming this , give @xmath10 = 0.1501 @xmath11 0.0016 . within the context of the sm",
    "this favours a light higgs mass",
    ". the invisible width of the z boson allows the number of light neutrinos to be extracted ( assuming @xmath12 from the sm ) , and gives n@xmath13 = 2.9841 @xmath11 0.0083 , which is 1.9 @xmath14 below 3 .",
    "in addition to these results , which involve only the z - lepton couplings , there are also results involving z - quark couplings .",
    "there are six such heavy - flavour quantities used ; namely , the partial hadronic branching ratios and pole forward - backward asymmetries for b and c quarks ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) and the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 , measured directly by the slc using a polarised electron beam .    there are six determinations of the effective weak mixing angle , giving an average value @xmath21=0.23153 @xmath11 0.00016  @xcite . there is a long - standing and _ a posteriori _ observation that the value obtained from purely leptonic processes ( @xmath21=0.23113 @xmath11 0.00021 ) is some 3.2@xmath14 different to that obtained using heavy quarks ( @xmath21=0.23222 @xmath11 0.00027 ) .",
    "this comes mostly from the 3.2@xmath14 difference between the sld @xmath6 and the @xmath17 values .",
    "the heavy - flavour results favour a rather heavy higgs boson .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the overall @xmath22 probability for the compatibility of all 6 measurements is reasonable ( 3.8@xmath23 ) .",
    "the w boson is produced singly at the tevatron ( eg @xmath24 ) .",
    "the leptonic decays w@xmath25 ( with @xmath26 ) are used to determine the w mass and width , using the transverse mass , p@xmath27 or p@xmath28 .",
    "cdf have published a run 2 measurement , using an integrated luminosity of @xmath29 0.2 fb@xmath2 , which gives @xmath30 = 80.413 @xmath11 0.048 gev ; the single most precise experimental value .",
    "the tevatron average has been recently updated ( see @xcite , where details and references can be found ) , using a more consistent treatment of the run 1 uncertainties on pdf s , electroweak corrections and the value of @xmath31 at which @xmath30 is determined .",
    "this is important because the measured @xmath30 and @xmath31 values have a significant correlation .",
    "the sm value of @xmath31 has also been updated  @xcite to @xmath31 = 2.093 @xmath11 0.002 gev , and the @xmath30 values are given for this value of @xmath31 .",
    "the updated tevatron average is @xmath30 = 80.432 @xmath11 0.039 gev .    at lep2",
    "the w bosons are pair - produced in @xmath32 .",
    "the individual results from the four experiments are final and published , but the combination process is still preliminary .",
    "the statistical uncertainties from the @xmath33 and @xmath34 channels are similar .",
    "the final state interaction ( fsi ) uncertainties , which include non - perturbative colour reconnection ( cr ) and bose - einstein correlation ( bec ) effects in the @xmath34 final state , and which lead to ` cross - talk ' between the two w bosons , are still under study . at present a sizeable ( @xmath29 36 mev ) common uncertainty is used , and this means that the @xmath34 channel has only a 22% weight in the combination with the @xmath33 .",
    "the preliminary lep2 value is @xmath30 = 80.376 @xmath11 0.033 gev  @xcite .",
    "this is uncorrelated with the tevatron measurement , and combining all these gives @xmath30 = 80.399 @xmath11 0.025 gev .",
    "this value corresponds to a rather light higgs boson in the context of the sm .",
    "the tevatron w width , which includes a preliminary d0 and a published cdf value from run 2 , has also been updated  @xcite , giving @xmath31 = 2.050 @xmath11 0.058 gev . for lep2 ,",
    "the fsi uncertainty is still preliminary and the current preliminary lep combined value is @xmath31 = 2.196 @xmath11 0.083 gev .",
    "together these give a revised world average of @xmath31 = 2.098 @xmath11 0.048 gev , compatible with the sm expectation  @xcite .    in the sm",
    "the top quark decays mainly as t@xmath35wb .",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations have continued to improve the precision on the top - quark mass , using up to 2.8 fb@xmath2 of run 2 data and a variety of methods .",
    "the most precise values come from the @xmath36 final state .",
    "the uncertainty in the jet energy scale ( jes ) is the largest potential systematic effect and this is reduced by simultaneously fitting to @xmath37 and a multiplicative jes factor , such that the @xmath38 invariant mass is constrained to the well - known value of @xmath30 .",
    "the updated average value ( see @xcite , where details and references can be found ) is @xmath37 = 172.4 @xmath11 0.7 ( stat ) @xmath11 1.0 ( syst ) gev .",
    "this gives a total uncertainty of 1.2 gev , a relative precision of 0.7% .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath37 extracted correspond to those used in the various monte carlo simulation programs . at present , any potential common systematic uncertainties associated with non - perturbative qcd effects ( e.g. colour reconnection ) are not included .",
    "the sm parameters required for the electroweak fits are @xmath39 , g@xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , ( the electromagnetic and strong coupling constants at the scale @xmath39 ) , and the top - quark mass @xmath37 . through loop diagrams , measurements of the precision electroweak quantities",
    "are sensitive to @xmath37 ( quadratically ) and , to the ` unknown ' in the sm , @xmath43 ( logarithmically ) .",
    "the sm computations use the programs topaz0 and zfitter ( for more details see  @xcite ) .",
    "the latter program ( version 6.42 ) incorporates the fermion 2-loop corrections to @xmath21 and full 2-loop and leading 3-loop corrections to @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath44 at the scale @xmath39 requires the use of data on @xmath45 hadrons at low energies and the use of perturbative qcd at higher energies .",
    "the various estimations of @xmath41 differ in the extent to which perturbative qcd is used , as well as in the data sets used in the evaluation .",
    "the quantity needed is the hadronic contribution from the 5 lightest quarks @xmath46 , and the value used by the lep ewwg  @xcite is @xmath46(@xmath39 ) = 0.02758 @xmath11 0.00035  @xcite .",
    "new data , since the publication of  @xcite , particularly preliminary data from bes , could have a sizeable influence on both the central value and uncertainty .",
    "so finalisation of these bes results could have an important influence on the results of the electroweak fits .",
    "it is worth noting that the present uncertainty on @xmath46(@xmath39 ) corresponds to @xmath47 20% .",
    "the 17 measurements used in the global sm electroweak fits , and the corresponding fitted values , are shown in fig .",
    "[ s08_higgs ] .",
    "the sm fit to these high q@xmath48 data gives    @xmath49 = 172.5 @xmath11 1.2 gev    @xmath50 = 0.1185 @xmath11 0.0026    @xmath51 = 84 @xmath52 gev ,    with a @xmath22/ndf of 17.2/13 ; a probability of 19% .",
    "the variation of the fit @xmath22 , compared to the minimum value , is shown in the ` blue - band ' plot of fig .",
    "[ s08_higgs ] , as a function of @xmath43 . also shown is the direct sm higgs search limit of 114 gev from lep2 searches .",
    "the one - sided 95% upper limit is @xmath53 154 gev .",
    "this includes the theoretical uncertainty ( blue - band ) , which is evaluated by considering the uncertainties in the 2-loop calculations  @xcite .",
    "if the more theory - driven value @xmath46(@xmath39 ) = 0.02749 @xmath11 0.00012 is used , then the fitted value of @xmath43 increases to 94 gev .",
    "it is also interesting to note that there is now  @xcite a 95% exclusion limit from the tevatron at around @xmath54170 gev .",
    "since the fits made in 2007  @xcite , the main change is from the new top - quark mass ( previous value @xmath37 = 172.4 @xmath11 1.8 gev ) , resulting in an increase in @xmath43 of about 8 gev with respect to @xcite .",
    "the quantities on which improved experimental precision can be expected in the near future are @xmath37 , @xmath30 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the relative current sensitivity to these quantities can be estimated as follows .",
    "if the central value of @xmath37 , which is input to the fit , is changed by @xmath11 1 @xmath14 ( i.e. @xmath11 1.2 gev ) , then the corresponding shifts in the fitted values of @xmath43 are + 9 gev and -8 gev respectively . similarly , for @xmath11 1 @xmath14 changes in @xmath30 ( i.e. @xmath11 25 mev ) ,",
    "the corresponding shifts in the fitted values of @xmath43 are -13 gev and + 17 gev respectively . for @xmath11 1 @xmath14 changes in @xmath46 ( i.e. @xmath11 0.00035 ) , the corresponding shifts in the fitted values of @xmath43 are -15 gev and + 17 gev respectively .",
    "so it can be seen that improving the precision of @xmath30 and @xmath46 is particularly important .",
    "comparison of the direct versus indirect values of @xmath37 and @xmath30 is a powerful test of the sm ; see fig .",
    "[ s08_mt_mw_contours ] .",
    "this method of presenting the electroweak data was first formulated in @xcite .",
    "the contours shown are for the 68% cl .",
    "it can be seen that there is a reasonable degree of overlap and that both the direct and indirect data prefer a light higgs mass .",
    "indeed , the region preferred by the data corresponds to that expected in mssm susy models .",
    "it is of interest to consider the effect of the future improved precision which can be expected from the tevatron . assuming that the uncertainty on @xmath37 can be reduced from 1.2 to 1.0 gev , and that the uncertainty on the world average value of @xmath30 can be reduced from 25 to 15 mev , then",
    ", if the central values of all measured quantities remain the same , the fitted higgs mass would become    @xmath51 = 71 @xmath55 gev ,    with a one - sided 95% upper limit of 117 gev .",
    "that is , this limit would not be far from the direct exclusion limit from lep2 .",
    "so the improved precision might lead to the interesting situation where the results would be in conflict with the sm .",
    "the current electroweak data severely constrain the standard model and prefer a relatively light higgs boson mass .",
    "improvements in the accuracy of the measurments used in the extraction of @xmath46 are important . the improved precision on both @xmath37 and @xmath30 expected from the tevatron , and then the lhc , is easily awaited ."
