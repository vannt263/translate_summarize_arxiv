    "the supernova 1997ef ( sn 1997ef ) was discovered on november 25 , 1997 at an r magnitude of 16.7 near the spiral galaxy ugc4107 ( sano 1997 ) .",
    "the first spectrum was taken on november 26 ( garnavich 1997a ) .",
    "subsequently , photometric and spectroscopic follow - ups have provided high quality optical light curves and spectra ( garnavich 1997a , b , c ; hu 1997 ; filippenko 1997 ; wang 1998 ) .",
    "as seen in figure [ spic2 ] , the spectra of sn 1997ef are dominated by broad oxygen and iron lines but do not show any clear feature of hydrogen or helium ( garnavich 1997b ; filippenko 1997 ) , showing the overall similarity to other type ic supernovae ( sne ic ) 1994i and 1998bw .",
    "this led us to classify sn  1997ef as a sn ic .    in figure [ lcic ] the visual light curve of sn 1997ef ( garnavich 1997b , c )",
    "is compared with those of the sn  ic 1998bw ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) and the ordinary sn  ic 1994i ( richmond 1996a , b ) . despite the spectral similarity ,",
    "the light curve of sn  1997ef is quite different from those of sn  1998bw and sn  1994i .",
    "it has quite a flat peak , much broader than those of the other sne ic . besides ,",
    "the tail of the light curve of sn  1997ef starts late and the rate of its decline is much slower than in other sne ic .",
    "it is also true that the light curves are rather diverse , even in this limited number of samples , implying a range of energies and/or progenitor masses of sn ic explosions .",
    "the most striking and peculiar characteristic of sn  1997ef is the breadth of its line features .",
    "such broad spectral features were later recognized to be a distinguishing property of the spectra in sn 1998bw ( fig .",
    "[ spic2 ] ) .",
    "sn 1998bw was discovered within the error box of grb980425 determined by the bepposax satellite , only 0.9 days after the date of the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) , and therefore probably related to this grb ( galama et al .",
    "the very broad spectral features and the light curve shape have led to the conclusion that sn 1998bw had an extremely large _ kinetic _ energy of explosion , @xmath6 3 ergs ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ; woosley , eastman , & schmidt 1999 ) .",
    "this was one order of magnitude larger than the energy of typical supernovae , thus sn 1998bw was termed a `` hypernova '' ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the spectral similarities between sn 1997ef and sn 1998bw suggest the interesting possibility that sn 1997ef may also be a hypernova .",
    "in fact , a possible connection with a grb has been suggested for sn  1997ef : grb971115 appears to be compatible with the supernova in the position and the time of occurrence ( wang & wheeler 1998 ) .",
    "since the statistical significance for this case is much weaker than for the case of sn  1998bw and grb980425 , it is difficult to confirm the physical association between sn 1997ef and grb971115 .",
    "however , it is possible at least to clarify whether sn 1997ef is a hypernova or not by estimating the kinetic energy of explosion through modeling of light curves and spectra as in the case of sn 1998bw ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ; mazzali 1999 ) .",
    "this is exactly the primary purpose of this paper .",
    "we constructed supernova progenitor models and performed detailed hydrodynamics and radiation transfer calculations to obtain light curves and spectra for the explosion models .",
    "the results were compared with observations of sn 1997ef , to derive its explosion energy and the ejecta mass , and thus to determine whether sn 1997ef was an ordinary sn ic or a hypernova . since the light curves of the other sne ic 1994i and 1998bw were successfully reproduced by the collapse - induced explosion of c+o stars ( nomoto et al .",
    "1994 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "1994 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) , we adopted c+o stars as progenitor models for sn 1997ef as well .",
    "this paper consists of six sections including this introduction .",
    "section 2 describes the ordinary sn ic model and the hypernova model .",
    "the method and results of our light curve calculations are presented in  3 .",
    "the synthetic spectra are compared with the observations in  4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to discussion on various issues including the sn - grb connection and possible progenitor scenarios .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in  6 .",
    "we construct hydrodynamical models of an ordinary sn ic and a hypernova as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) in the ordinary sn ic model(model co60 ) , a c+o star with a mass @xmath7 ( which is the core of a 25 @xmath8 main - sequence star ) explodes with kinetic energy of explosion @xmath9 ergs and ejecta mass @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 (= 1.4 ) denotes the mass of the compact star remnant ( either a neutron star or a black hole ) .",
    "\\(2 ) in the hypernova model ( co100 ) , a c+o star of @xmath12 is constructed from the 10  he star ( which has a 8 c+o core ) by removing the outermost 2  of he layer and extending the c+o layer up to @xmath13 .",
    "this model corresponds to 30 - 35 @xmath8 on the main - sequence .",
    "this progenitor goes off with @xmath14 ergs and @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath11 = 2.4 .",
    "the hydrodynamics at early phases was calculated by using a lagrangian ppm code ( colella & woodward 1984 ) with a simple nuclear reaction network including 13 alpha elements ( mller 1986 ) .",
    "detailed post - processing calculations were carried out with a larger - size nuclear reaction network including 240 isotopes ( hix & thielemann 1996 ) .",
    "the explosion is triggered by depositing thermal energy in a couple of zones just below the mass cut so that the final kinetic energy becomes the required value .",
    "the position of the mass cut is adjusted for the ejected mass of @xmath16ni to be @xmath17ni ) @xmath18 .",
    "the compact remnant in co60 is likely a neutron star because @xmath19 = 1.4 , while it may be a black hole in co100 because @xmath19 (= 2.4 ) may well exceed the maximum mass of a stable neutron star .",
    "the above values of @xmath11 are determined so that @xmath17ni)@xmath20 is ejected to reproduce the maximum brightness of sn  1997ef by the radioactive decay heating of @xmath16ni and @xmath16co .",
    "these model parameters are summarized in table 1",
    ". they can be constrained by comparing the calculated light curves and synthetic spectra with observations .",
    "the parameters of models co21 for sn  1994i ( nomoto et al . 1994 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "1994 ) and co138 for sn  1998bw ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) are also given in table 1 .",
    "we constructed the progenitor model by attaching a thin hydrostatic and in - thermal - equilibrium c+o envelope to the c+o core of the presupernova model ( nomoto & hashimoto 1988 ; hashimoto 1995 ) .",
    "the expansion soon becomes homologous so that @xmath21 . the solid lines in figure [ vrhonew ]",
    "show the density distributions in the velocity space for co60 and co100 at @xmath22 16 days .",
    "the expansion velocities are clearly higher in co100 than in co60",

    "the total amount of nucleosynthesis products are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the light curve calculation is started , when the ejecta have reached the homologous expansion phase , with a one - dimensional spherically symmetric radiation transfer code ( iwamoto 1997 ) .",
    "the code solves the multi - frequency radiative transfer equation for the specific intensity @xmath23 in the comoving frame , including all terms up to the first order in @xmath24 ( mihalas & mihalas 1984 ) ,    @xmath25 i_{\\nu } \\right\\ }                           \\nonumber\\\\   & - & \\frac{\\pa}{\\pa \\nu } \\left\\ { \\nu \\left [ ( 1-\\mu^{2 } ) \\frac{v}{cr }    + \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{c}\\frac{\\pa v}{\\pa r } \\right ] i_{\\nu } \\right\\ }    \\nonumber\\\\   & + & \\left[(3-\\mu^{2 } ) \\frac{v}{cr }    + \\frac{1+\\mu^{2}}{c}\\frac{\\pa v}{\\pa r } \\right ] i_{\\nu }           \\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\kappa_{\\nu}b _ { \\nu } - \\kappa_{\\nu } i_{\\nu } -\\sigma_{\\nu } i_{\\nu }    + \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\int \\sigma_{\\nu } i_{\\nu } d \\omega,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the absorptive and scattering opacities , respectively , @xmath28 is the planck function and @xmath29 is the cosine of the angle made by the radial direction and the direction of the ray . this equation is solved numerically using the feautrier method with an approximate lambda operator similar to the one described by hauschildt ( 1992 ) .    to determine the gas temperatures , equation ( 1 ) is solved simultaneously with the energy equation and the first two moment equations of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the energy equation of the radiation plus gas is written as    @xmath30    while the radiation energy and momentum equations are @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , where @xmath33 is the thermal energy of ions and electrons per unit mass , and @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the radiation energy density , flux , and the eddington factor defined as follows .",

    "the energy mean @xmath47 and the planck mean opacities @xmath48 include only the absorptive part , while the flux mean opacity @xmath49 is the total opacity .    for bound - bound transitions , energy levels and transition probabilities",
    "are taken from the compilation by kurucz ( 1991 ) . for bound - free data",
    ", we use the analytic fitting formula to the photoionization cross sections given by verner & yakovlev ( 1995 ) . local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte )",
    "is assumed to determine the ionization balance and the level populations of each ion .",
    "however , the non - lte effect is approximately taken into account by assuming that the value of the absorptive fraction @xmath50 is a constant less than unity in equations ( 8) and ( 9 )",
    ". experiments of spectral syntheses have shown that a value @xmath51 is a reasonable choice for this fraction ( baron et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "it has been argued by several authors that the expansion would increase the chance of interactions between radiation and matter through line transitions , and thus the mean opacities become larger than in static medium , especially at relatively early phases ( karp , lasher , & chan 1977 ; eastman & pinto 1993 ; blinnikov 1996 ) .",
    "however , we neglected this expansion effect in evaluating the mean opacities , although this is one of the currently controversial issues .",
    "the energy deposition due to the radioactive decays is calculated with a one energy - group @xmath52-ray - transfer code ( iwamoto 1997 ) .",
    "we assume an absorptive opacity @xmath53 and the complete trapping of positrons .",
    "the rest - frame flux is calculated from the comoving - frame intensities using the following transformation :    @xmath54    @xmath55    for the calculation of the light curves of co60 and co100 discussed in the next subsection , we use about 200 radial mesh points to solve the moment equations ( 2)-(4 ) , while 800 frequency and 50 radial mesh points were used for the multi - frequency radiative transfer equation ( 1 ) .      in figure [ lc97ef ]",
    "we compare the calculated v light curves for models co60 and co100 with the observed v light curve of sn1997ef .",
    "we adopt a distance of 52.3 mpc ( a distance modulus of @xmath56 mag ) as estimated from the recession velocity , 3,400 km s@xmath57 ( garnavich 1997a ) and a hubble constant @xmath58 km s@xmath57 mpc@xmath57 .",
    "we assume no color excess @xmath59 ; this is justified by the fact that no signature of a narrow na i d interstellar absorption line is visible in the spectra of sn  1997ef at any epochs ( garnavich 1997a ) .",
    "the light curve of sn 1997ef has a very broad maximum , which lasts for @xmath60 25 days .",
    "this is much broader than in both the ordinary sn ic 1994i and the hypernova sn 1998bw .",
    "the light curve tail of sn  1997ef starts only @xmath61 days after maximum , much later than in other sne ic .",
    "the light curve of sn 1997ef can be reproduced basically with various explosion models with different energies and masses . in general , the properties of the light curve are characterized by the decline rate in the tail and the peak width , @xmath62 .",
    "the peak width scales approximately as @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the optical opacity ( arnett 1996 ) .",
    "this is the time - scale on which photon diffusion and hydrodynamical expansion become comparable . since the model parameters of co100 and co60 give similar @xmath62 , the light curves of the two models look similar : both have quite a broad peak and reproduce the light curve of sn1997ef reasonably well ( fig .",
    "[ lc97ef ] ) .",
    "the light curve shape depends also on the distribution of @xmath16ni , which is produced in the deepest layers of the ejecta .",
    "more extensive mixing of  leads to an earlier rise of the light curve . for sn 1997ef",
    ", the best fit is obtained when the @xmath16ni is mixed almost uniformly to the surface for both models . without such extensive mixing , the rise time to v @xmath65 16.5 mag would be @xmath60 30 d for co100 , which is clearly too long to be compatible with the spectroscopic dating ( see  4 ) .",
    "model co60 has the same kinetic energy ( @xmath66 erg ) as model co21 , which was used for sn ic 1994i ( see table 1 for the model parameters ) .",
    "since the light curve of sn 1997ef is much slower than that of sn 1994i , the ejecta mass of co60 is @xmath60 5 times larger than that of co21 .",
    "the ejecta mass of co100 is a factor of @xmath67 larger than that of co60 , and it is only @xmath68% smaller than that of model co138 , which was used for sn 1998bw ( table 1 ) .",
    "thus the explosion energy of co100 should be @xmath69 times larger than that of co60 to reproduce the light curve of sn 1997ef .",
    "this explosion is very energetic , but still much weaker than the one in co138 .",
    "the smaller @xmath70 for a comparable mass allows co100 to reproduce the light curve of sn 1997ef , which has a much broader peak than that of sn 1998bw .",
    "the light curve of sn 1997ef enters the tail around day 40 .",
    "since then , the observed v magnitude declines linearly with time at a rate of @xmath71 mag day@xmath57 , which is slower than in other sne ic and is even close to the @xmath16co decay rate @xmath72 mag day@xmath57 .",
    "such a slow decline implies much more efficient @xmath52-ray trapping in the ejecta of sn 1997ef than in sn 1994i .",
    "the ejecta of both co100 and co60 are fairly massive and are able to trap a large fraction of the @xmath52-rays , so that the calculated light curves have slower tails compared with co21 .",
    "however , the light curves for both models decline somewhat faster in the tail than the observations .",
    "a similar discrepancy has been noted for the type ib supernovae ( sne ib ) 1984l and 1985f ( swartz & wheeler 1991 ; baron , young , & branch 1993 ) .",
    "the late time light curve decline of these sne ib is as slow as the  decay rate , so that the inferred value of @xmath73 is significantly larger ( and/or @xmath70 is smaller ) than those obtained by fitting the early light curve shape .",
    "baron et al .",
    "( 1993 ) suggested that the ejecta of these sne ib must be highly energetic and as massive as @xmath60 50 . in  5.1",
    ", we will suggest that such a discrepancy between the early- and late - time light curves might be an indication of asphericity in the ejecta of sn 1997ef and that it might be the case in those sne ib as well .",
    "as we have shown , light curve modeling provides direct constraints on @xmath74 and @xmath70 .",
    "however , it is difficult to distinguish between the ordinary sn ic and the hypernova model from the light curve shape alone , since models with different values of @xmath75 and @xmath70 can reproduce similar light curves .",
    "however , these models are expected to show different evolutions of the photospheric velocity and the spectrum as will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "the photospheric velocity scales roughly as @xmath76 , so that @xmath75 and @xmath70 can be constrained by @xmath77 in a different way from by means of the light curve width .",
    "figure [ vph97ef ] shows the evolution of the observed velocities of the si  ii line measured in the spectra at the absorption core , and the velocities at the grey photosphere computed by the light curve code for models co60 and co100 .",
    "the velocities of the si  ii line are somewhat higher than that of the photosphere , reaching @xmath60 20,000 at the earliest time .    in model co60 the photosphere forms at velocities much smaller than those of the observed lines , while co100 gives photospheric velocities as high as the observed ones .",
    "it is clear , from this comparison , that the hyper - energetic model co100 is preferable to the ordinary model co60 .",
    "the apparent discrepancy that still exists between the co100 and observations might be related to the morphology of the ejecta , i.e. , its deviation from spherical symmetry , as was also suggested in the case of sn  1998bw ( hflich , wheeler , & wang 1999 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "this issue will be discussed in  5.1 .",
    "to strengthen the arguments in  3.3 , we compare the observed spectra with theoretical model spectra computed using our explosion models with a more sophisticated spectrum synthesis code(mazzali & lucy 1993 ; lucy 1999 ; mazzali 1999 ) . with such a detailed spectrum synthesis",
    ", we can distinguish between different models more clearly , because the spectrum contains much more information than a single - band light curve .    around maximum light ,",
    "the spectra of sn  1997ef show just a few very broad features , and are quite different from those of ordinary sne ib / c , but similar to sn  1998bw .",
    "however , at later epochs the spectra develop features that are easy to identify , such as the ca  ii ir triplet at @xmath78 , the o  i absorption at 7500  , several fe  ii features in the blue , and they look very similar to the spectrum of the ordinary sn ic 1994i .",
    "we computed synthetic spectra with a monte carlo spectrum synthesis code using the density structure and composition of the hydrodynamic models co60 and",
    "co100 . the code is based on the pure scattering code described by mazzali & lucy ( 1993 ) , but has been improved to include photon branching , so that the reprocessing of the radiation from the blue to the red is followed more accurately and efficiently ( lucy 1999 ; mazzali 1999 ) .",
    "we produced synthetic spectra for three epochs near maximum , of sn  1997ef : nov 29 , dec 5 , and dec 17 .",
    "these are early enough that the spectra are very sensitive to changes in the kinetic energy . as in the light curve comparison",
    ", we adopted a distance modulus of @xmath56 mag , and @xmath79 .",
    "the model parameters , the computed temperatures and the magnitudes of the synthetic spectra for co100 are listed in table 3 .    in figure [ spco60 ]",
    "we show the synthetic spectra computed with the ordinary sn  ic model co60 .",
    "the lines in the spectra computed with this model are always much narrower than the observations .",
    "this clearly indicates a lack of material at high velocity in model co60 , and suggests that the kinetic energy of this model is much too small .",
    "synthetic spectra obtained with the hypernova model co100 for the same 3 epochs are shown in figure [ spco100new ] .",
    "the spectra show much broader lines , and are in good agreement with the observations . in particular , the blending of the fe lines in the blue , giving rise to broad absorption troughs , is well reproduced , and so is the very broad ca - o feature in the red .",
    "the two ` emission peaks ' observed at @xmath80 and 5200  correspond to the only two regions in the blue that are relatively line - free .",
    "a similar situation is observed in sn  1998bw ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the spectra are characterized by a low temperature , even near maximum , because the rapid expansion combined with the relatively low luminosity ( from the tail of the light curve we deduce that sn  1997ef produced about @xmath81 of @xmath16ni , compared to about @xmath82 in a typical sn  ia and @xmath83 in sn  1998bw ) leads to rapid cooling .",
    "thus the siii 6355  line is not very strong .",
    "although model co100 yields rather good synthetic spectra , it still fails to reproduce the observed large width of the o  i - ca  ii feature in the only near - maximum spectrum that extends sufficiently far to the red ( 5 dec 1997 ) .",
    "an improvement can be obtained by introducing an arbitrary flattening of the density profile at the highest velocities .",
    "full details of the spectrum synthesis calculations , including insights on the density structure and the abundance in the ejecta will be given in a separate paper ( mazzali et al .",
    ", 1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "we have shown that the light curve , the photospheric velocities , and the spectra of sn  1997ef are better reproduced with the hyper - energetic model co100 than with the ordinary sn ic model co60 .",
    "however , there remain several features that are still difficult to explain with model co100 .",
    "\\(1 ) the observed velocity of si ii decreases much more rapidly than models predict .",
    "it is as high as @xmath60 30,000  at the earliest phase , but it gets as low as @xmath60 3,000  around day 50 ( fig .",
    "[ vph97ef ] ) .",
    "we find that it is difficult to get such a rapid drop of the photospheric velocity not only in models co100 and co60 , but also in other models that can reproduce the light - curve shape reasonably well .",
    "models with higher energies and/or smaller masses would be able to reproduce the fast evolution of the photospheric velocity , but such models would inevitably produce light curves with a narrower peak and a faster tail .",
    "\\(2 ) obviously , the observed light curve declines slower than model co100 in the tail part , and it is also a bit flatter than the model near the maximum part(fig .",
    "[ lc97ef ] ) .",
    "models with lower energies and/or larger masses are able to give improved fits to both the peak and the tail of the light curve .",
    "but , then it gets very difficult to reproduce the large photospheric velocities observed at early times in sn  1997ef .",
    "this dilemma might be overcome if we introduce multiple components of the light curve from different parts of ejecta moving at different velocities .",
    "in fact , the discrepancies may be interpreted as a possible sign of asphericity in the ejecta : a part of ejecta moves faster than average to form the lines at such high velocities at early phases , while the other part of ejecta expands with a lower velocity so that the low - velocity si ii line comes up at later epochs . having a low - velocity component",
    "would also make it easier to reproduce the slow tail .",
    "\\(3 ) extensive mixing of @xmath16ni is required to reproduce the short rise time of the light curve . according to hydrodynamical simulations of the rayleigh - taylor instability in the ejecta of envelope - stripped supernovae ( hachisu 1991 ; iwamoto 1996 )",
    ", large scale mixing can not be expected to occur in massive progenitors , because in the core of such massive stars the density gradient is not steep enough around the composition interfaces .",
    "one possibility to induce such mixing in the velocity space is an asymmetric explosion(e.g . ,",
    "nagataki , shimizu , & sato 1998 ) .",
    "higher velocity  could reach the ejecta surface so that the effect of radioactive heating comes up as early as is required from light curve modeling .    in order to realize higher densities at low velocity regions without increasing the mass of ejecta significantly",
    ", it may be necessary that the explosion is somewhat aspherical .",
    "if the explosion is aspherical , the shock would be stronger and the material would expand at a larger velocity in a certain direction , while in its perpendicular direction , on the other hand , the shock would be weaker , ejecting lower - velocity material ( e.g. , hflich et al . 1999 )",
    ". the density of the central region could be high enough for @xmath52-rays to be trapped even at advanced phases , thus giving rise to a slowly declining tail ( see nakamura et al .",
    "1999a for a discussion of sn  1998bw ) . in the extremely asymmetric cases",
    ", the material ejection may happen in a jet - like form .",
    "a jet could easily bring some  from the deepest layer to the surface of high velocity .",
    "detailed spectral analysis of observed spectra for different epochs are necessary to investigate this issue further .",
    "there have been an increasing number of candidates for the gamma - ray burst(grb)/supernova connection , including grb980425/sn1998bw ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ; iwamoto et al . 1998 ; iwamoto 1999 ) , grb970514/sn1997cy ( germany et al .",
    "1999 ; turatto et al .",
    "1999 ) , grb980910/sn1999e ( thorsett & hogg 1999 ) .",
    "two other high - z grbs may also be associated with supernovae : grb980326 ( bloom et al . 1999 ) and grb970228 ( reichart 1999 ; galama et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the optical transients of these grbs showed significant reddening and temporal slow down ( even with a second maximum ) in their late light curves , which can be fitted by the early power - law decay plus the red - shifted light curve of sn 1998bw .",
    "as noted in  1 , a possible connection between sn 1997ef and grb971115 has been suggested ( wang & wheeler 1998 ) .",
    "recently another sn ic , 1998ey , showed a spectrum with very broad features , very similar spectra to that of sn1997ef on dec 17 ( garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ) ; but no grb counterpart has been proposed for sn  1998ey .",
    "although this may cast some doubt on the general association between hypernovae and grbs , it must be noted that both sne 1997ef and 1998ey were less energetic events than sn  1998bw .",
    "it is possible that a weaker explosion is less efficient in collimating the @xmath52-rays to give rise to a detectable grb ( grb980425 was already quite weak in gamma - rays compared to the average grbs ) , or that some degree of inclination of the beam axis to the line of sight results in a seemingly weaker supernova and in the non - detection of a grb .",
    "only the accumulation of more data will allow us to address these questions .      for the study of the chemical evolution of galaxies , it is important to know the mass of @xmath16ni , @xmath17ni ) , synthesized in core - collapse supernovae as a function of the main - sequence mass @xmath84 of the progenitor star ( e.g. , nakamura et al .",
    "1999b ) . from our analysis of sn 1997ef",
    ", we can add a new point on this diagram .",
    "we evaluate the uncertainty in our estimates of @xmath17ni ) and @xmath84 .",
    "we need 0.15  of @xmath16ni to get a reasonable fit to the light curve of sn 1997ef at a distance @xmath85 mpc .",
    "the expected 10% uncertainty in the distance leads to a 20% uncertainty in the @xmath16ni mass , i.e. , @xmath17ni ) @xmath86 0.03 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath16ni affects the peak luminosity somewhat , but the effect is found to be much smaller than that of the uncertainty in the distance . a 10  c+o star corresponds to a @xmath87 30 - 35 , but the uncertainty involved in the conversion of the core mass to @xmath84 may involve a larger uncertainty if the progenitor undergoes a close binary evolution .",
    "figure [ nimass ] shows @xmath17ni ) against @xmath84 obtained from fitting the optical light curves of sne 1987a , 1993j , and 1994i ( e.g. , shigeyama & nomoto 1990 ; nomoto et al .",
    "1993 , 1994 ; shigeyama 1994 ; iwamoto 1994 ; woosley et al . 1994",
    "; young , baron , & branch 1995 ) .",
    "the amount of @xmath16ni appears to increase with increasing @xmath84 of the progenitor , except for sn ii 1997d ( turatto et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "this trend might be explained as follows .",
    "stars with @xmath88 25  form a neutron star , producing @xmath60 0.08 @xmath89 0.03  as in sn iib 1993j , sn ic 1994i , and sn 1987a ( although sn 1987a may be a borderline case between neutron star and black hole formation ) .",
    "stars with @xmath90 25  form a black hole ( e.g. , ergma & van den heuvel 1998 ) ; whether they become hypernovae or ordinary sne ii may depend on the angular momentum in the collapsing core . for sn 1997d , because of the large gravitational potential , the explosion energy is so small that most of  fell back onto a compact star remnant ; the fall - back might cause the collapse of the neutron star into a black hole .",
    "the core of sn ii 1997d might not have a large angular momentum , because the progenitor had a massive h - rich envelope so that the angular momentum of the core might have been transported to the envelope possibly via a magnetic - field effect .",
    "similarly , a negligible amount of ejection of  in black hole formation has recently been suggested for x - ray nova sco ( gro j1655 - 40 ) , where the companion star of the black hole seems to be enriched with s , si , mg , and o but not fe ( israelian et al . 1999 ) .",
    "hypernovae such as sne 1998bw , 1997ef , and 1997cy might have rapidly rotating cores owing possibly to the spiraling - in of a companion star in a binary system .",
    "the outcome certainly depends also on mass - loss rate and binarity .",
    "as noted in  5.2 , it has been claimed that the optical afterglows of grb s 980326 and 970228 are better reproduced if a red - shifted light curve of sn 1998bw is superposed on a power - law light component ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ; reichart 1999 ; galama et al .",
    "a question arising from these two examples is whether the supernovae associated with grbs have a uniform maximum luminosity , i.e. , whether 0.7  production as in sn 1998bw is rather common or not .",
    "however , the present study of sn 1997ef shows that the  mass and thus intrinsic maximum brightness of sn 1997ef is smaller than in sn 1998bw by a factor of 4 - 5 ( see the next subsection ) .",
    "we certainly need more examples for defining the luminosity function and the actual distribution of masses of @xmath16ni produced in supernovae / hypernovae .      here",
    "we classify possible evolutionary paths leading to c+o star progenitors .",
    "in particular , we explore the paths to the progenitors that have rapidly rotating cores with a special emphasis , because the explosion energy of hypernovae may be extracted from rapidly rotating black holes(blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "\\(1 ) case of a single star : if the star is as massive as @xmath91 40 , it could lose h and he envelopes in a strong stellar wind ( e.g. , schaller 1992 ) .",
    "this would be a wolf - rayet star .",
    "\\(2 ) case of a close binary system : suppose we have a close binary system with a large mass ratio . in this case , the mass transfer from star 1 to star 2 inevitably takes place in a non - conservative way , and the system experiences a common envelope phase where star 2 is spiraling into the envelope of star 1 . if the spiral - in releases enough energy to remove the common envelope , we are left with a bare he star ( star 1 ) and a main - sequence star ( star 2 ) , with a reduced separation . if the orbital energy is too small to eject the common envelope , the two stars merge to form a single star ( e.g. , van den heuvel 1994 ) .",
    "( 2 - 1 ) for the non - merging case , possible channels from the he stars to the c+o stars are as follows ( nomoto , iwamoto , & suzuki 1995 ) .",
    "\\(a ) small - mass he stars tend to have large radii , so that they can fill their roche lobes more easily and lose most of their he envelope via roche lobe overflow .",
    "\\(b ) on the other hand , larger - mass he stars have too small radii to fill their roche lobes",
    ". however , such stars have large enough luminosities to drive strong winds to remove most of the he layer ( e.g. , woosley , langer , & weaver 1995 ) . such a mass - losing he star would corresponds to a wolf - rayet star .",
    "thus , from the non - merging scenario , we expect two different kinds of sne ic , fast and slow , depending on the mass of the progenitor .",
    "sne ic from smaller mass progenitors ( channel a ) show faster light - curve and spectral evolutions , because the ejecta become more quickly transparent to both gamma - ray and optical photons .",
    "the slow sne ic originate from the wolf - rayet progenitors ( channels b and 1 ) .",
    "the presence of both slow and fast sne ib / ic has been noted by clocchiatti & wheeler ( 1997 ) .    ( 2 - 2 ) for the merging case , the merged star has a large angular momentum , so that its collapsing core must be rotating rapidly .",
    "it would lead to the formation of a rapidly rotating black hole from which possibly a hyper - energetic jet could emerge . if the merging process is slow enough to eject h and he envelopes , the star would become a rapidly rotating c+o star .",
    "such c+o stars are the candidates for the progenitors of type ic hypernovae like sne 1997ef and 1998bw .",
    "if a significant amount of h - rich ( or he ) envelope remains after merging , the rapidly rotating core would lead to a hypernova of type iin possibly like sn 1997cy ( or type ib ) .",
    "we have shown that the photospheric velocities and the spectra of sn  1997ef are much better reproduced by the hyper - energetic model co100 than by the ordinary sn ic model co60 .",
    "the model parameters determined for co100 are @xmath92 erg , @xmath3 ( which corresponds to the c+o core of a 3035 @xmath8 star ) , and @xmath73()@xmath93 .",
    "the compact star remnant of co100 is as massive as @xmath94 2.4 , thus possibly being a black hole .",
    "this high explosion energy would be extracted from the rapidly rotating black hole .    for sn  1997ef ,",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath73 ( ) and @xmath70 are all slightly smaller than for sn  1998bw , but sn  1997ef can certainly be regarded as a _",
    "hypernova _ in terms of the kinetic energy of explosion .",
    "therefore , we suggest that sne 1997ef , 1998ey , and 1998bw form a new class of hyper - energetic type ic supernovae , which we call hypernovae .",
    "they are distinguished by their large kinetic energies , 8 - 60 times larger than in ordinary supernovae .",
    "the smaller line velocities at advanced phases and the flatter light curve tail of sn  1997ef than the models predict may suggest the presence of a low - velocity , relatively dense core , while its higher line velocities at early phases imply the presence of a yet - higher - velocity component of ejecta .",
    "these are very difficult to be reconciled with any spherically symmetric models , even with the high - energy spherical model co100 .",
    "this discrepancy between models and the observations , as well as the extensive mixing of @xmath16ni required to explain the early rise of the light curve , seems to indicate that the explosion of sn 1997ef was at least somewhat aspherical .",
