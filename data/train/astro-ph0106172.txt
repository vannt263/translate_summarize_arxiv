    "analysis of the iras bright galaxy sample showed that 30% of the energy output in the local universe emerges in the mid and far infrared ( 5  200  @xmath0 m ) ( soifer and neugebauer , 1990 ) and the bulk of this luminosity is due to star formation in these galaxies . recently , the idea that the bulk of the radiant energy emitted in the universe has been emitted at infrared wavelengths has been raised through analysis of the far infrared background as measured by the cobe satellite ( hauser et al .",
    "1998 , puget et al . 1996 ) .",
    "further , deep submillimeter surveys have suggested that much of this luminosity is being generated in forming galaxies at redshifts of z@xmath1 2 ( e.g. , eales et al .",
    "2000 ) .    infrared luminous starbursts in the local universe",
    "afford us the best opportunity to study the processes by which such systems form and evolve , and provide detailed examples where we can test physical models of such systems .",
    "the iras all sky survey ( joint iras science team , 1989 ) has provided a unique database from which many such systems have been chosen for detailed examination .    a wide variety of observational techniques",
    "have been employed to probe infrared luminous starburst galaxies , ranging from optical spectroscopy ( e.g. , kim et al .",
    "1995 , veilleux et al .",

    "because dust responds through its thermal emission instanteously to the radiation field in which it is embedded , thermal radiation by dust is the ideal way to trace the current location of the dominant luminosity sources , i.e. the most luminous stars , in starbursts . in very dusty systems , such as those known from iras observations to be luminous starbursts",
    ", high spatial resolution imaging in the thermal infrared can address the location and extent of the current star formation in these galaxies unimpeded by foreground extinction .",
    "how the thermal dust emission is related to the other tracers of star - formation is important for utilizing these tracers in more distant galaxies .",
    "iras measured the total bolometric luminosity from these galaxies ( e.g. soifer et al .",
    "the spatial resolution of those observations , @xmath2 , was , however , inadequate to locate the emission within the galaxies .",
    "because the mid - infrared wavelengths ( 825  @xmath0 m ) carry a significant fraction of the total bolometric luminosity in infrared bright galaxies , ranging from @xmath310% to @xmath4 30% of the 81000  @xmath0 m luminosity , observations at these wavelengths with a resolution @xmath5 have the potential to directly trace the locations where the most luminous stars are forming in these systems . with a diffraction limit of 0.24@xmath6 fwhm at 10  @xmath0 m",
    ", the keck telescope provides a substantial improvement in spatial resolution over previous mid - infrared observations , probing the distribution of the thermal emission at the 100300 pc scale in luminous starbursts at distances of 40120 mpc .    in this paper",
    "we report imaging observations from 8  18  @xmath0 m of a sample of highly luminous starburst galaxies at spatial resolutions of 0.3 - 0.6@xmath6 .",
    "these data provide the highest spatial resolution yet achieved of the thermal emission from these systems and trace the spatial distribution of the emergent luminosity in these systems . for purposes of establishing luminosities and physical distances in these galaxies",
    "we adopt h@xmath7=75  km  s@xmath8mpc@xmath8 .",
    "the objects observed were taken from the iras bright galaxy sample ( bgs , soifer et al .",
    "1987 , 1989 ) the basic information for the seven objects in the sample is given in table 1 .",
    "since the goal of this study is to understand luminous starburst galaxies , systems having seyfert like spectra were excluded . with this selection criterion , there are 25 objects in the bgs in the luminosity range 11.4 @xmath9 log(l@xmath10[l@xmath11)@xmath9 11.9 ; seven were observed .",
    "these seven objects are among the closest highly infrared luminous starbusts galaxies .",
    "six of the seven objects observed have clear evidence of strong interactions / mergers from optical images .",
    "the only object without such evidence , markarian 331=ugc 12812 , has several close companions . in this luminosity range 60 - 70% of objects",
    "are found in strongly interacting or merging systems ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 , sanders and mirabel , 1996 ) .",
    "the objects were selected to be detectable from the ground at 12  @xmath0 m , so that there is a bias towards brighter 12  @xmath0 m flux densities in these galaxies , as measured by iras , compared to the galaxies in the same luminosity range in the bgs .",
    "three of the galaxies in the sample , ic 1623=vv114 , ngc 3690/ic 694=arp 299 and ngc 1614=arp 186 are the three brightest objects at 12  @xmath0 m in the above sample .",
    "this selection of brighter 12  @xmath0 m flux density appears to be the major bias in our sample as compared to the total bgs sample for this luminosity range .",
    "the observations were made using the mirlin mid - infrared camera ( ressler et al .",
    "1994 ) at the f/40 bent cassegrain visitor port of the keck ii telescope , and the imaging mode of the long wavelength spectrograph ( lws , jones and puetter , 1993 ) at the f/25 forward cassegrain focus of the keck i telescope . in general , only observations where the fwhm of the psf was less than 1.0@xmath6 were used .",
    "because of the variability , the seeing conditions are described throughout the text when specific objects are discussed .    the mirlin camera uses a 128@xmath12128 si : as array with a plate scale of 0.138@xmath6/pixel for a total field of view of 17@xmath1317@xmath6 . at each wavelength",
    "the observing procedure was the same .",
    "a secondary with a square wave chop of amplitude 6@xmath6 in the north - south or east - west direction at 4 hz was employed for fast beam switching .",
    "the frames sampling each chop position were coadded separately in hardware , resulting in two images . after an interval of approximately a minute ,",
    "the telescope was nodded perpendicular to the chop direction ( east - west or north - south ) by 6@xmath6 and a second pair of images was obtained in order to cancel residuals in the sky and to subtract telescope emission .",
    "this procedure was repeated a number of times at each wavelength .",
    "the data were reduced by differencing the two images obtained within the chop pairs at each nod location .",
    "then the resulting positive images were coadded , with the positions appropriately adjusted to a common location , to yield an image centered in a field approximately 6@xmath136@xmath6 . because of the chopper and telescope nod spacings employed for the observations , the data are not capable of measuring low surface brightness emission that is extended beyond a 6@xmath6 diameter region . in addition extended emission within a 6@xmath6 region with a surface brightness of 5 mjy / square arcsec is not detectable within these images .",
    "observations with mirlin of vv114 , ngc 1614 , ngc 3690 and markarian 331 were obtained in march and october 1998 .",
    "the mirlin observations were made under photometric conditions .",
    "the observations of the targets were interleaved with observations of nearby bright stars that served as photometric calibration and to establish the point spread function ( psf ) for the observations .",
    "observations of all the galaxies listed in table 1 were made with lws in october 1999 , and january , may and september 2000 . generally these observations were made under photometric conditions . over the course of the observations , the mid - infrared seeing varied from near diffraction limit(@xmath14 at 12.5@xmath0 m ) to @xmath15 .",
    "the secondary chopper was set to an amplitude of 5@xmath6 at a frequency @xmath3 5 hz for all the objects except ngc  1614 , ngc  2623 , ic  883 , where the chopping amplitude was 4@xmath6 .",
    "observations were made in a fashion similar to the mirlin observations , except that the telescope nodding was in the same direction as the chopping and the nodding amplitude was the same as the chopping amplitude .",
    "the data were reduced in a manner similar to the mirlin data .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.08@xmath6 pixel@xmath8 .    the filters defining the photometric bands are quite similar in both mirlin and lws and all have widths about 10  % of the central wavelengths which are listed in table  2 .",
    "details of the filters are given in soifer et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "the photometry was calibrated based on observations of four bright stars , @xmath16 tau = hr  1457 ( [ 12.5  @xmath0m]=-3.07  mag ) , @xmath16 boo = hr  5340 ( [ 12.5  @xmath0m]=-3.15  mag ) , @xmath17 peg",

    "the magnitudes adopted at the other mid - infrared wavelengths for these stars were within 0.08  mag of these values .",
    "the uncertainties in the photometry , based on the internal consistency of the observations , is estimated to be 5% at @xmath1817.9  @xmath0 m .",
    "the flux density corresponding to 0.0 mag ( vega - based ) was taken to follow the prescription given in the explanatory supplement to the iras catalogs and atlases ( beichman et al .",

    "( 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , high spatial resolution observations of two of these galaxies , vv114=arp 236 and ngc 3690=arp 299 were obtained at 3.2  @xmath0 m with nirc ( matthews and soifer , 1994 ) on the keck i telescope in dec 1996 .",
    "although the background is higher at this wavelength than at shorter wavelengths , observations were made in the standard `` stare and dither '' mode for near infrared observations .",

    "the spectrum of dudley , if smoothed to the resolution of the filters used for our imaging , is consistent with the apparent ratio of fluxes at 11.7 and 12.5  @xmath0 m as shown for the flux from vv114e in the large beam shown in figure  1d .",
    "the separate spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of vv114e@xmath23 and vv114e@xmath24 differ significantly .",
    "the decrease in flux density at 10  @xmath0 m of vv114e@xmath23 is substantially deeper than in vv114e@xmath24 .",
    "the composite mid - infrared spectrum of galaxies presented by dale et al .",

    "this is also consistent with the fact that the southwest source appears to dominate the vv114e flux throughout most of the 10  @xmath0 m wavelength range .",

    "in all the galaxies , the sed of the individual star forming regions shows a significant increase in ratio of 12.5  @xmath0 m to 2.2  @xmath0 m flux in the small beams , compared to the integrated light of the galaxies . typically this ratio is larger by a factor of two in the star forming region as compared to the integrated light for the galaxy , but it ranges to nearly an an order of magnitude for the reddest source ( c@xmath20 ) in ngc 3690 . for distant star forming galaxies , such as those seen in scuba submillimeter surveys ( e.g. eales et al .",
    "2000 ) , sirtf observations will be required to obtain the equivalent observations to those presented here .    presumably the 12.5  @xmath0 m emission is tracing the far infrared emission associated with the same star formation complexes . if the fraction of the total infrared luminosity emitted by the individual regions in these galaxies is similar to the fraction of the 12.5  @xmath0 m flux density compared to the total 12  @xmath0 m flux density measured by iras , these regions produce from @xmath47l@xmath48 to @xmath49l@xmath48 within a few hundred pc .",
    "while not as luminous as the ulirgs , the star formation rates are still prodigious by comparison to normal galaxies like the milky way .",
    "the star formation rates are from 0.7 to 30 m@xmath48/yr , based on the conservative luminosity / star formation rate conversion of scoville and young ( 1983 ) or scoville and soifer ( 1990 ) . if the conversion from luminosity to star formation rate is a factor of several greater than this , as is the case for models that account for the formation of stars with mass @xmath251 m@xmath48(cf .",
    "kennicutt , 1998 ) , the total star formation rates go up accordingly .",
    "since the mid - infrared sources trace the high luminosity regions in these galaxies , these data provide direct evidence of the physical characteristics of the regions in which the starburst luminosity is being generated .",
    "table 3 presents a summary of the sizes , brightness temperatures , and color temperatures of the mid - infrared sources .",
    "the inferred brightness temperature at 60  @xmath0 m is calculated assuming the same angular size as measured at 12.5  @xmath0 m , and assuming the same fraction of the total 60  @xmath0 m flux density ( as determined from the iras data ) emerges from the region as is observed for the source at 12  @xmath0 m . in physical sizes , the detected sources range from @xmath50 pc to almost 1 kpc . in a few cases it is not physically possible for the bulk of the luminosity to emerge from sources of the sizes inferred from the 12.5  @xmath0 m images ,",
    "since the brightness temperature at 60  @xmath0 m is larger than the color temperature of the source ( here we assume that the color temperature is the global color temperature , determined from the iras 60 and 100 @xmath0 m flux densities ) .",
    "in these cases the far infrared source size must be larger than the observed 12.5  @xmath0 m source size .",
    "the minimum source sizes necesary for equal color and brightness temperatures at 60  @xmath0 m are also given in table 3 , and generally are close to , or slightly larger than , the upper limits on sources sizes determined from the 12.5  @xmath0 m keck observations .    with these estimates of the physical sizes of the emitting regions determined , we can compare the derived surface brightnesses with those of both lower and higher luminosity sources .",
    "table 3 includes the surface brightnessess in l@xmath48/kpc@xmath51 derived from the fwhm estimated source sizes ( corrected for the psf size ) and the fraction of the total luminosity of the source inferred from the 12.5  @xmath0 m measured flux density for that source .",
    "as can be seen from table 3 , these values range from 2@xmath52 to @xmath53l@xmath48/kpc@xmath51 . by comparison , the infrared surface brightnesses in the ulirgs observed by soifer et al .",

    "thus , while the apparent physical sizes are similar to those found in ulirgs , the apparent surface brightnesses of star formation are lower by factors of 310 or more .",
    "the difference in luminosities between the luminous starburst galaxies and the ulirgs appears to be in the luminosity generated in a given volume rather than in the volume in which the luminosity is generated .",
    "the core of orion , with a luminosity of @xmath57 l@xmath48 over 0.3 pc ( werner et al .",
    "1976 ) , has an apparent surface brightness of @xmath58 l@xmath48/kpc@xmath51 , while the apparent face - on surface brightness of the starburst region in m82 is @xmath59l@xmath48/ kpc@xmath51 ( soifer et al .",
    "previous work ( meuer et al . 1997 ) has shown that in normal galaxies , the surface brightness of star formation reaches an upper limit of @xmath60l@xmath48/kpc@xmath51 globally averaged over entire galaxies , with peak surface brightnesses of clusters of size @xmath310 pc of @xmath61l@xmath48/kpc@xmath51 .",
    "thus the starburst regions in these systems appear extraordinary in comparison with normal galaxies , but not with respect to the highest density star forming environments within galaxies .",
    "table 4 summarizes the surface brightnesses of nearby starburst systems , the starburst regions in the galaxies in this sample , and the starburst regions in ulirgs from soifer et al .",
    "we can see clearly here that while there is significant scatter , there appears to be a natural progression in surface brightness in the galaxies , with increasing surface brightness accompanying increasing luminosity .",
    "table 4 shows that in these luminous starburst galaxies environments equivalent to the core of orion extend over hundreds of parsecs .",
    "turner , beck & ho ( 2000 ) and gorjian , turner & beck ( 2001 ) have recently shown that in the nearby dwarf galaxy ngc 5253 star formation that produces @xmath3 2@xmath62l@xmath48 is occurring in a region @xmath3 2 pc in size , i.e. in a `` super starcluster '' .",
    "the observations described here can not rule out the possibility that much of the luminosity in the starburst galaxies studied here emerges from regions of similar size , although the most luminous systems in this sample would require clusters of @xmath3100 such `` super starclusters '' in regions of order @xmath3200 pc in diameter .    in about half of the galaxies in this sample",

    "we have obtained mid - infrared diffraction limited imaging of seven starburst galaxies with the keck telescopes .",
    "these observations have shown    1 - a substantial fraction , usually more than 50% , of the mid - infrared luminosity in these systems is generated in regions ranging in size from @xmath3100 pc to 1 kpc ,    2 - nuclear starbursts generally dominate the starburst activity in these galaxies .    3 - in some cases , most notably ngc 6090 ,",
    "substantial infrared luminosity is generated in regions away from the galaxy nuclei , and is more likely associated with the region of physical interaction between two galaxies .    4 - the radio emission in starburst galaxies is a good tracer of the current location of compact star - formationing regions .",
    "5 - mid - infared emission is much more compact than is near infrared emission in these galaxies .",
