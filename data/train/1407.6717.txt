    "mixed - morphology ( mm ) or thermal composite supernova remnants ( snrs ) represent a class of snrs which consist of thermal x - ray - filled centers and radio - bright shells , such as w44 , w28 , 3c391 , and w49b ( rho & petre 1998 ; jones et al .",
    "this category of snrs displays a good correlation with  or molecular clouds ( mcs ; rho & petre 1998 ; also see the snr  mc association catalog in jiang et al .",

    "debates on the origin of the central x - rays are still on - going .",
    "several competitive scenarios were proposed to explain the bright x - ray emission in the mm  snr interior .",
    "the first one invokes the thermal conduction model leading to a central density increase ( cui & cox 1992 ; shelton et al .",
    "1999 ; cox et al .",
    "it predicts that the temperature smoothly decreases while the density rises away from the center , creating a  center - filled \" hot x - ray morphology with a thin , dense , and cold radiative shell in the periphery .",

    "zhou et al .

    "the figure shows that w28  is evolving in a complicated environment with a dense mc in the east and a molecular stripe on the northern inner shell .",
    "there is a range of temperature and density distribution on the shells , represented by three kinds of emission : cold and dense mcs indicated by co emission located in the outermost boundary ; hot and tenuous x - rays generally located behind ; warm and moderately dense gas radiating h@xmath28  emission and situated between the mcs and the x - ray - emitting gas .",

    "coulomb collisions dominate over other loss mechanisms , and contribute to the flattening of the spectrum and to lowering the observed flux ( sturner et al .",
    "the loss - flattened spectrum yields a hard photon index @xmath458 , where @xmath459 is the spectral index of the parent electrons .",
    "uchiyama et al .",
    "( 2002 ) utilized this scenario to explain the extremely flat x - ray spectrum ( with a photon index of @xmath4601.5 ) of several clumps in the evolved snr @xmath11-cygni .",
    "a similar scenario can be applied to the case of the ne part of w28(@xmath4612.4 ) .    in w28 ,",
    "the non - thermal bremsstrahlung emitted by electrons suffering coulomb losses is a potential explanation for the faint , relatively flat x - ray emission from the ne shell .",
    "the non - thermal electrons can be accelerated by radiative shock waves propagating into mcs ( bykov et al .",
    "if non - thermal bremsstrahlung is the dominant contributor to the hard x - ray continuum detected in the dense shell , we expect to obtain a spectral index of @xmath4623.4 for the parent elections .      the hadronic origin of the @xmath11-ray  emission in w28 has been widely discussed and accepted .",
    "accompanying the @xmath463-decay @xmath11-rays , secondary electrons from the decay of the charged pions can radiate non - thermal emission through the synchrotron and bremsstrahlung processes .",
    "the broadband non - thermal emission from the mcs illuminated by crs accelerated in snrs has been modeled by gabici et al .",
    "we adopt this model here for w28  to calculate the broadband spectrum of the secondary electrons for the ne mcs ( see figure  [ f : sec ] ) .",
    "the following parameters for w28  have been adopted in this model : age @xmath464  yr , supernova explosion energy @xmath465  erg , fractional energy deposited to crs @xmath466 = 0.1 , and distance of the mc to the remnant center @xmath467  pc ( li & chen 2010 ) . the shape of the spectrum is mainly determined by four parameters : the correction factor of the diffusion coefficient ( @xmath468 ) , the power - law index of diffusion coefficient ( @xmath469 ) , the magnetic field in the mc ( @xmath470 ) , and the cloud mass ( @xmath471 ) .",
    "we initially determine the distribution of the secondary electrons by fitting the @xmath11-ray  data from the _ fermi _ ( abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) and h.e.s.s .",
    "( aharonian et al .  2008 ) observations .",
    "the fitting gives @xmath472 , @xmath473 and @xmath474 which are consistent with the previous results obtained by li & chen ( 2010 ) .",
    "the synchrotron radiation from the secondary electrons strongly depends on the strength of the magnetic field in the mc and gets enhanced with increasing magnetic field values .",
    "however , even if the magnetic field is increased up to @xmath475 g , the synchrotron emission is not strong enough to explain the observed non - thermal x - rays .",
    "moreover , the bremsstrahlung from the secondary electrons , which peaks around 100  mev , is also too low to fit the observed x - ray data .",
    "the emissivity of bremsstrahlung from the secondary electrons is proportional to the gas density squared but not sensitive to the magnetic field .",
    "increasing the gas density , however , does not enhance the flux due to the electrons strong energy loss by bremsstrahlung .",
    "the spectrum extraction region  shell \" in the ne edge just overlaps a small part of the illuminated mc ; however , the observed non - thermal x - ray flux is still much higher than could be produced by the secondary electrons from the whole mc . in summary ,",
    "the secondary electrons origin is not a favorable scenario to explain the hard x - ray tail .",
    "it is of interest to search for the relationship between the non - thermal x - rays and the radio synchrotron emission , since the bright x - ray shell appears spatially coincides with the radio peak .",
    "it is suggested that , in an inhomogeneous medium , the fast shock propagating in the intercloud medium accelerates particles to higher energies and generates radio synchrotron and @xmath11-ray  emission , while the shock propagating in the clouds is able to accelerate electrons to energies below gev giving birth to non - thermal hard x - ray and mev @xmath11-ray  emission ( bykov et al .",
    "2000 ; chevalier 1999 ) .",
    "the overall radio spectral index of w28  is observed to be @xmath476 ( @xmath477 ) , with the index values on the bright radio filaments systematically flatter than in the snr cavity ( dubner et al .",
    "accordingly , we infer the energy spectral index of the radio emitting electrons on the shell to be @xmath478 , which is much lower than the index of the parent electrons radiating bremsstrahlung x - rays ( @xmath4623.4 ; see section  [ s : brem ] above ) .",
    "this discrepancy implies that non - thermal radio and x - ray emission do not arise from the same population of electrons , and suggest that the radio emission likely originates from the intercloud shock while the flat x - ray emission is associated with the cloud shock .",
    "as discussed in sections  [ s : global ] and [ s : comp ] , the gas in the interior of w28  is spatially variant , clumpy , x - ray bright , and best characterized by a two - temperature plasma , or even a recombining plasma . in sections  [",
    "s : in_twot ] and [ s : in_rec ] , we discuss the physics of the centrally bright x - ray emission based on the former and latter models , respectively .",
    "projection effect is one of the mechanisms that is suggested to explain the centrally peaked x - ray morphology .",
    "one projection case occurs when the interaction zone between the snr and a one - sided dense medium is projected , along the line of sight , to the remnant interior ( petruk 2001 ) .",
    "the enhanced intervening hydrogen absorption , high [ ] /h@xmath28 ratio , low temperature , and relatively high density along the northern inner shell ( typified by region  cn \" ) indeed imply that a shock interaction with dense interstellar medium ( most probably , mc ) is projectively seen in the interior . although the x - ray brightness seems to peak inside the inner shell , we do not attribute it to the projection effect ;",
    "the reason is that the scenario that the bright x - rays come from the shocked dense gas in the remnant s edge is inconsistent with the low [ ] /h@xmath28  ratio near the x - ray brightness peak .",
    "another type of projection effect was studied by shimizu et al.(2012 ) : when the shock breaks out of disk - like circumstellar medium to a rarefied interstellar medium , the hot over - ionized plasma appears to be centrally - filled ( bar - like ) in the equatorial plane .",
    "the scenario was applied to describe the x - ray morphology of the much younger snr w49b ( 10004000  yr ; see shimizu et al.2012 , and references therein ; see also zhou et al .",
    "however , at the late - phase ( @xmath479  yr ) , the snr evolves to be shell - like independently of the viewing angle rather than centrally - filled , and w28 , at a large age ( 3@xmath393 ) , would be of this case . hence , the projection effects are unlikely to explain the central x - ray emission .    the thermal conduction model is often used to explain the central x - ray emission of mm  snrs ( cox et al .",
    "1999 ; shelton et al .",
    "1999 ) . without the suppression of magnetic fields ,",
    "the conduction timescale is given by @xmath480 @xmath481  kyr , where @xmath482 ( @xmath483 ) is the scale length of the temperature gradient , @xmath484 is the collisional conductivity , and @xmath485 is the coulomb logarithm . if @xmath482 is taken as the radius of the snr @xmath486  pc in the northern hemisphere , and we use the temperature 0.77 kev and density @xmath487 of the hot component in the central region `` c '' , the conduction timescale is estimated to be 21 kyr , which is smaller than the dynamical age of w28 .",
    "hence , thermal conduction may play a role in the center of w28 .",
    "however , the almost monotonic decrease of the temperature of both the hot and cold components from west to east across the central region ( see section  [ s : twot ] and table  [ t : center_d ] ) is inconsistent with the prediction of the thermal conduction model .",
    "actually , rb02 have also regarded a large temperature gradient ( observed with _ rosat _  and _ asca _ ) from the western ear - like structure to the eastern shell as a difficulty for the model to be applied to w28 .",
    "moreover , in the thermal conduction model , the pressure at the snr center is @xmath0 of that at the shell and the central density is much lower ( @xmath488 at radiative shell formation ) than the ambient gas density ; but in this study , the pressure ratio between the central gas and the ne shell is @xmath489 and the density ratio is @xmath490 , which are much larger than the model prediction .",
    "these inconsistencies may be due to the over - simplified conduction model in comparison with a more complicated , highly nonuniform , interstellar environment and physical conditions .",
    "also , the magnetic field may be another potential factor to suppress the effect of thermal conduction .",
    "an alternative scenario for the centrally brightened x - ray morphology is the cloudlet evaporation model ( white & long 1991 ) .",
    "a series of observational facts in w28 seem to favor this scenario .",
    "firstly , blobby x - rays and diffuse h@xmath28  emission are detected in the snr center , indicating that the central gas is highly clumpy and thus probably contains plenty of cloudlets required by the model .",
    "secondly , the cloudlets embedded in a previously shocked , hot gas are gradually evaporated , and the newly evaporated material is expected to be dense and characterized by a low temperature plasma .",
    "this can naturally explain the two - temperature component model of the x - ray emission from the w28  interior .",
    "thirdly , the cold component in our best fit spectral model has a low ionization timescale ( @xmath491 ) indicating an nei state , and this is expected by the cloudlet evaporation model .",
    "moreover , the cloudlet evaporation model predicts that collisionally excited h@xmath28  emission is generated in the evaporating flow and has a larger luminosity than the x - ray luminosity for evaporation - dominated snrs , and this has indeed been pointed out to be the case in w28 ( long et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "comparatively , the cloudlet evaporation mechanism can essentially explain the properties of the x - ray emission in the central region of w28 , but the thermal conduction mechanism can also play a role in a length scale comparable to the remnant s radius .",
    "however , the limited field of view in the _ xmm - newton _  observations and the complicated x - ray brightness profile that rb02 obtained using _ rosat _  observation prevent us from a detailed quantitative calculation using the evaporation model .",
    "the recombining plasma model is also a feasible model for the central gas ( see section  [ s : dis_rec ] ) .",
    "the presence of the over - ionized plasma needs a rapid cooling process , such as drastic adiabatic expansion ( including rarefaction process , itoh & masai 1989 ) , thermal conduction ( kawasaki et al .",
    "2002 ) and both processes ( zhou et al .",
    "the rarefaction scenario predicts a rapid electron cooling after the shock breaking out of the dense circumstellar medium and adiabatically expands to a tenuous ambient medium .",
    "though , the slight density variation inferred from the _ xmm - newton _  analysis seems not support a distinctive density decrease from the explosion center .",
    "thermal conduction to low - temperature gas in small clouds may also rapidly cool the nearby hot gas .",
    "as diffuse h@xmath28  emission has been detected in the snr center and overlaps the hot x - ray - emitting plasma , it can be expected that many dense clouds emitting the optical emission are embedded in the hot plasma . on the other hand ,",
    "if cloudlet evaporation is not negligible , it is very possible that the hot plasma could be rapidly cooled down by mixing with the dense and cooler plasma evaporated from the clouds .",
    "indeed , a numerical simulation by zhou et al .",
    "( 2011 ) has shown that the mixing of the gas evaporated from dense material is one important cooling mechanism to produce the over - ionized plasma in snr w49b .",
    "we have investigated the hot gas in the northern hemisphere of the mm  snr w28  by performing an _ xmm - newton _  imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopic study .",
    "the main results and conclusions are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  image reveals a deformed shell in the northeast which partly overlaps the molecular gas and h@xmath28  emission .",
    "the x - ray emission in the interior is blobby and appears to be confined in the north and east by the h@xmath28  filaments . 2 .",
    "the x - rays arising from the ne shell , where the shock  mc interaction is evident and @xmath11-ray  emission is seen , consist of a soft thermal component ( @xmath122 kev ) plus a hard component of either non - thermal ( @xmath4612.4 ) or thermal ( @xmath128  kev ) origin .",
    "the ionization age is estimated to be @xmath492  yr and 1@xmath493  yr , respectively , from the former model ( @xmath32+@xmath24 ) and the hot component of the latter model ( double-@xmath32 ) , further supporting an evolved stage of snr w28 . according to the @xmath32+@xmath24  model",
    ", we estimate a density of @xmath494 for the hot post - shock plasma . in the double-@xmath32  model",
    ", the soft x - ray component may originate in the shocked cloud material with a density of @xmath495 , while the harder x - rays may be emitted from the inter - cloud gas with a density of @xmath496 .",
    "3 .   if the hard x - ray emission of the ne shell is indeed non - thermal , a possible origin for its flat spectrum is the non - thermal bremsstrahlung emitted by the electrons suffering coulomb losses . the low spectral index and the difficulty in accelerating electrons to @xmath497tev - energy disfavor a synchrotron origin .",
    "the hard spectrum also can not be reproduced by the secondary electrons from the hadronic interaction between the cosmic ray protons and the ambient mcs .",
    "furthermore , the spectral index of the parent electrons of the non - thermal x - rays ( @xmath4623.4 ) , is larger than the index of the electrons generating the synchrotron radio emission ( @xmath498 ) , indicating that the x - ray and radio emission do not share the same population of electrons and possibly originate from different shocks .",
    "4 .   the gas inside the remnant yields a low elemental abundance with no evidence of ejecta . following a careful background subtraction that minimizes contamination by the galactic ridge emission ( an improvement over previous x - ray studies ) ,",
    "we find that the spectra of the hot central gas can be best fitted with a two - temperature model ( @xmath32+@xmath31 ) and also can be adequately described with a recombining plasma model ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "5 .   in the two - temperature model",
    "( for the central gas ) , the cold component is under - ionized at a temperature @xmath499 , and the hot component is a cie plasma at @xmath500 .",
    "the spatially resolved spectral study reveals variations in temperature , gas density , and intervening absorption inside the remnant . in the north and east (  cn \" and  c4 \" ) of the x - ray - brightness peak",
    ", the plasma gets relatively cold and dense , and the x - rays suffer heavier foreground absorption than those in other parts of the central region , and filamentary h@xmath28  structures are detected .",
    "this distribution is consistent with the scenario that the remnant is evolving in an non - uniform medium with dense gas located in the northeast .",
    "the hot central gas can alternatively be described with a multi-@xmath446 recombining plasma model with an electron temperature @xmath501 .",
    "the recombination age of the gas is estimated as @xmath502  yr , slightly lower but close to the dynamical age of w28(34@xmath503  yr ) .",
    "the parameters of the recombination model show a slight variation among the small regions in the snr interior , except that the northern region ",
    "cn \" , spatially coincident with the inner radio shell , shows the largest recombination timescale and lowest ionization temperature .",
    "the clumpy structure of the central hot gas revealed by the x - ray mapping favors the cloudlet evaporation process , which can explain the two - temperature components , the low ionization timescale of the cold component , and the larger h@xmath28  luminosity than that of the x - ray .",
    "though , in the two - temperature model , thermal conduction may also play a role in a scale as large as the remnant s radius .",
