    "the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model@xcite provides a natural geometric picture for the hierarchy between the weak scale and the apparent gravitational scale , @xmath7 . in this model ,",
    "two 3-branes truncate a 5-dimensional curved spacetime . in the original rs construction ,",
    "the standard model ( sm ) fields reside on the sm ( or tev ) brane where a scale , which is exponentially smaller than the fundamental 5-d scale , is induced by the geometry .",
    "gravity is localized on the second brane , known as the planck brane .",
    "this exponential hierarchy is controlled by the distance @xmath8 between the two branes and can generate the weak scale on the sm brane .",
    "the physics of the graviton kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes is governed by the same scale .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath8 can be stabilized by bulk scalar fields@xcite , resulting in the appearance of a single weak scale radion field .",
    "the most generic and distinctive signature of this model@xcite is the presence of tev - scale spin-2 graviton kk resonances at colliders .",
    "it is important to examine whether modifications arising in a more realistic rs scenario could affect the kk graviton phenomenology .",
    "one such modification is the introduction of brane curvature terms for the graviton .",
    "these terms respect all 4-d symmetries , and are expected to be present in a 4-d effective theory , leading to brane localized kinetic terms ( blkt s ) for the graviton .",
    "it has been argued that brane quantum effects can generate blkts@xcite , and that these terms are required as brane counter terms for bulk quantum effects@xcite .",
    "in addition , since the higgs field is assumed to reside on the sm brane , a higgs - curvature mixing term can be included in the brane action .",
    "such a term is allowed by all 4-d symmetries and leads to higgs - radion mixing with important phenomenological consequences@xcite .",
    "we observe that the same higgs - curvature mixing term can also induce a blkt for the graviton on the sm brane .",
    "thus , there are many good theoretical reasons for assuming the presence of such terms for gravitons .",
    "the effects of blkt s on graviton physics have been studied for flat spacetimes@xcite and result in novel features .",
    "boundary terms have also been shown to significantly modify the kk phenomenology of bulk gauge fields in flat@xcite and warped geometries@xcite .",
    "for the case of an alternative rs model with only one brane and an uncompactified 5@xmath9 dimension , the gravitational and cosmological effects of these terms have been analyzed@xcite .",
    "however , the case of the compactified rs model , which is relevant for weak scale physics , in principle involves graviton boundary terms on both branes and has yet to be examined .",
    "we study this case here and investigate the effects on the phenomenology of the weak scale kk gravitons in the presence of localized curvature terms .",
    "we derive the modified graviton kk spectrum and couplings and show that a significant dependence on the size of such terms emerges .",
    "we illustrate that this leads to considerable changes in the low energy 4-d phenomenology of the rs model .",
    "these changes could have important implications for future searches and the potential discovery of model signatures .",
    "in addition , we derive bounds on the magnitude of the localized curvature terms on the planck and tev branes , by requiring the absence of graviton and radion ghost states .    the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",

    ", one can imagine brane terms which are quadratic or even higher order in @xmath23 , but these terms are small and would violate the philosophy of the original model where classical general relativity is applicable .",

    ", this form implies that the graviton wavefunctions are @xmath56 independent . note that this normalization factor remains positive for all values of @xmath66 so that this parameter is not constrained by these considerations .",

    "we see that for @xmath79 these couplings have suppressions @xmath80 .    before continuing ,",

    "a short analysis shows that the brane terms lead to a multiplicative correction to the usual radion kinetic term , in the absence of the higgs field , by a factor of @xmath82 ; the corresponding @xmath56-dependent contribution is found to be suppressed by powers of the exponential warp factor and we will ignore it in the following discussion . to avoid a radion ghost",
    "this implies that @xmath83 , suggesting that negative or small positive values of @xmath66 are allowed .",
    "this multiplicative factor can then be absorbed by a suitable field rescaling so that the radion field becomes canonically normalized .",
    "however , once the higgs - radion mixing term is included , this bound becomes a bit more complex since mixing and brane term contributions can compensate for one another .",

    "naturalness suggests that @xmath87 as discussed above and we will assume this soft bound in our discussion below .",
    "the first step in our analysis is to examine how the mass spectrum of the graviton kk modes is influenced by the presence of the brane kinetic terms parameterized via @xmath81 .",
    "as was noted above , both the root equation and the wave functions for the graviton kk modes in the extra dimension are found to be independent of @xmath56 when powers of the warp factor , @xmath88 , are neglected ; this implies that the @xmath89 for the range of interest to us are essentially @xmath56 independent .",

    "this will be true in particular in the case of of positive @xmath66 , where as we saw above the second kk mode is significantly heavier than the first mode and has a much weaker coupling to the sm brane fields .",

    "<S> we study the effects of including brane localized curvature terms in the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model of the hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the existence of brane localized kinetic terms for the graviton . </S>",
    "<S> such terms can be induced by brane and bulk quantum effects as well as higgs - curvature mixing on the brane . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the modified spectrum of kaluza - klein ( kk ) gravitons and their couplings to 4-dimensional fields in the presence of these terms . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the masses and couplings of the kk gravitons have considerable dependence on the size of the brane localized terms ; the weak - scale phenomenology of the model is consequently modified . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the weak - scale spin-2 graviton resonances which generically appear in the rs model may be significantly lighter than previously assumed . </S>",
    "<S> however , they may avoid detection as their widths may be too narrow to be observable at colliders . in the contact interaction limit , for a certain range of parameters , </S>",
    "<S> the experimental reach for the scale of the theory is independent of the size of the boundary terms .    </S>",
