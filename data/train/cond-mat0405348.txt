    "the sc in hf compounds has not yet been explained from the microscopic point of view , mainly due to the strong correlation effect and the complicated band structures .",

    "these new phenomena observed in cein@xmath2 should be understood in terms of a quantum phase separation because these new phases of matter are induced by applying pressure . in fermion systems , if the magnetic critical temperature at the termination point of the first - order transition is suppressed at @xmath19 , the diverging magnetic density fluctuations inherent at the critical point from the magnetic to paramagnetic transition become involved in the quantum fermi degeneracy region .",
    "the fermi degeneracy by itself generates various instabilities called as the fermi surface effects , one of which is a superconducting transition . on the basis of a general argument on quantum criticality , it is shown that the coexistence of the fermi degeneracy and the critical density fluctuations yield a new type of quantum criticality @xcite . in this context",
