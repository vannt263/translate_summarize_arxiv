    "monte carlo ( mc ) method with importance sampling is an excellent non - perturbative technique to calculate path integrals in quantum theory . in the last two decades , and it has successfully been applied to lagrangian lattice gauge theory @xcite . in the standard lagrangian mc method , however , it is extremely difficult to compute the spectrum and wave function beyond the ground state . on the other hand ,",
    "the standard hamiltonian formulation is capable of doing it .",
    "recently , we proposed an algorithm to construct an effective hamiltonian from lagrangian mc simulations in ref .",
    ". we called it the mc hamiltonian method .",
    "the advantage , in comparison with the standard lagrangian mc approach , is that one can obtain the spectrum and wave functions beyond the ground state .",
    "it also allows to do thermodynamics . in this paper , we briefly review what we have done , and present some new results .",

    "we believe that the application of the algorithm to more complicated body systems and quantum field theory will be very interesting .",
