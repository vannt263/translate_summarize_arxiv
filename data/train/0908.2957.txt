    "higher dimensional black objects and branes are of importance and interest in several areas of present days physics .",
    "the classical black hole uniqueness theorems are known to fail in higher dimensions , and it turns out that a whole menagerie of black objects ( black strings , rings , cigars , etc . ) appear to exist .",
    "the study of new types of black objects became a very active research field recently , and among many other interesting aspects , the properties of possible transitions between the different types , or _ phases _ , is of special interest ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . for example , during the transition between a caged black hole and a black string phase , kol @xcite demonstrated that the euclidean topology of the system changes .",
    "this type of transition is called _ merger _ transition , and",
    "kol found a strong similarity in its properties with the choptuik critical collapse phenomena @xcite .",
    "recently , frolov suggested a simple toy model with many features in common with merger and topology changing transitions @xcite .",
    "the model consists of a bulk @xmath6-dimensional black hole and a test @xmath7-dimensional brane in it ( @xmath8 ) , called _ brane - black hole _",
    "( bbh ) system .",
    "the black hole is spherically symmetric , static and can be neutral or charged .",
    "the brane is infinitely thin , and it is described by the dirac - nambu - goto @xcite action .",
    "it is also static , spherically symmetric and it is assumed to reach asymptotic infinity in the form of a @xmath9-dimensional plane . due to the gravitational attraction of the black hole ,",
    "the brane is deformed and there are two types of equilibrium configurations .",
    "the brane either crosses the black hole horizon , or it lies totally outside of the black hole ( see fig .  1 ) . in between the two types of configurations",
    "there exists a critical solution that separates the two phases .",
    "frolov studied the transition between the so called _ subcritical phase _",
    "( when the brane does not intersect the black hole horizon ) and _ supercritical phase _",
    "( when the brane crosses the horizon ) , and found a close similarity both with the merger transition in a caged black hole - black string system and with the choptuik critical collapse phenomena .    the ads / cft correspondence @xcite also provides motivation to study the above bbh system .",
    "in fact , according to the correspondence , at sufficiently high temperature , a small number of flavors ( @xmath10 ) of fundamental matter in strongly coupled gauge theories with a large number of colors ( @xmath11 ) , may be described , in the holographic dual , by probe dq - branes in the gravitational background of a black hole @xcite . in @xcite , using the tool of the gauge / gravity correspondence , mateos _ et al .",
    "_  studied the phase transition of quark - antiquark bound states ( mesons ) .",
    "their model was very similar to frolov s toy model , and using the results of @xcite , they demonstrated that in the case of an infinitely thin brane , the system generally undergoes a first order phase transition characterized by a change in the meson spectrum .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram in the vicinity of the critical solution exhibits a self similar structure , and this critical behavior and the first order transition are essentially universal to all dp / dq systems .    in @xcite",
    "it was also pointed out , that higher order corrections to the brane effective action may cause , in principle , modifications to the above picture and it is likely that they spoil the system s scaling symmetry and self - similar behavior .",
    "indeed , higher - derivative corrections to the d - brane action correspond to finite t hooft coupling corrections in the holographic dual , and provide a more realistic description of the system .",
    "these corrections may become important in the vicinity of the phase transition , since the curvature of the brane becomes large there .    in the context of low - scale gravity theories , the possibility that a micro black hole may form in high energy collisions , like those at the lhc , re - creates a setup similar to the bbh system described above .",
    "in particular , the question whether a black hole may escape into the extra dimensional bulk has raised some attention , due to the potential phenomenological relevance @xcite .",
    "clarifying the role of the thickness of the brane in that context is also an important issue .",
    "the dynamics of branes keeps also attracting attention in the context of higher dimensional generalizations of the bernstein conjecture @xcite and the study of the stability of brane - black hole systems @xcite .",
    "for all the above reasons , it is important to go beyond the approximation of zero thickness and consider higher order , curvature corrections coming from small thickness perturbations in the bbh system . curvature corrections to the dynamics of domain walls without self - gravitation , in the case of non - zero thickness have been investigated earlier by carter and gregory @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that the next to leading order contribution is quadratic in the wall width ( the brane thickness ) and they obtained an exact , analytic expression for the corresponding effective action in terms of the intrinsic ricci scalar @xmath12 and the extrinsic curvature scalar @xmath13 .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "frolov and gorbonos studied the role of curvature corrections on topology changing transitions based on the effective brane action presented in @xcite . in this work",
    "the authors focused their attention to the near - critical solutions and similarly to @xcite , they restrict their investigations to the rindler zone , i.e.  very close to the black hole horizon , where the radius of the intersection of the brane with the bulk horizon is much smaller than the radius of the bulk horizon . as an interesting result they found that `` the second order phase transition in such a system is modified and becomes first order '' .",
    "this , however , seems to be in contradiction with the results of mateos _ et al . _",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) , where the authors demonstrated that the phase transition in the unperturbed system is generally a first order one .",
    "additionally , they find that when the spatial dimension of the brane is larger than 2 , supercritical solutions behave quite differently from subcritical ones , and for supercritical solutions there is no singularity resolution .",
    "according to their numerical analysis , they did not find evidence for the existence of such solutions .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that stiffness correction to the brane action break the symmetry between the super- and subcritical solutions    in the present paper we re - consider thickness perturbations to the bbh system .",
    "we proceed within a more general framework than that of @xcite .",
    "we consider the same curvature corrected effective brane action obtained by carter and gregory @xcite , but we do not restrict ourselves to work in the rindler zone and in the near - critical solution region .",
    "in addition , we choose to follow a different path to obtain the dynamical equation for the perturbations .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we make a quick overview of the model in the infinitely thin case , and reintroduce the bbh setup to make the paper self - contained . in sec .",
    "iii the curvature quantities are discussed , while in sec .",
    "iv we obtain the euler - lagrange equation for the curvature corrected brane action . as for the latter ,",
    "we follow the perturbative treatment by carter and gregory @xcite , in the sense that we treat the curvature corrections as small perturbations in the effective action .",
    "they are indeed very small as being quadratic in the perturbation parameter . to obtain the dynamical equation for the perturbations , we use the quadratic perturbation parameter to expand the @xmath14-order euler - lagrange equation and keep the linear terms only . as a result , a second order ,",
    "linear equation is found to describe the perturbation function @xmath15 , with a very complicated source term . in sec .",
    "v we analyze the asymptotics of the perturbation equation , and find that there is no regular subcritical solution on the axis of the system above a certain dimension .",
    "this implies that our perturbation method is not appropriate in this region and a non - perturbative solution may be in order to find the general solution of the problem . in sec .",
    "vi we write down the full euler - lagrange equation , but due to its very complicated and highly nonlinear form we do not discuss its solution in the present paper . in sec .",

    "even though in ( [ ab ] ) we have already fixed the values of these parameters ( we identified them with the constants that are obtained in the relativistic domain wall case in @xcite ) , however , so far we have not used their explicit values .",
    "thus we could still consider the general case with arbitrary @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the problem with this way of regularization is that the constants @xmath123 and @xmath124 would be strongly dependent on the initial condition parameter @xmath50 , and hence provide a highly unstable solution .",
    "the other way of making @xmath122 disappear is to choose the brane dimension parameter @xmath125 or @xmath126 .",
    "indeed , instead of the previous option , we will follow this direction in the regularization process of ( [ fir1 ] ) and keep the parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 fixed as given in ( [ ab ] ) .",

    "the reason of the irregular behavior of the perturbations for @xmath127 is due to the asymmetry between the sub- and supercritical configurations induced by the curvature corrections .",
    "it also seems obvious that going beyond this approximation , within a perturbative approach , will not resolve the problem . in @xcite",

    "this , however , does not mean that physically reasonable solutions do not exist , as the explicitly constructed field theoretical domain wall solutions clearly show @xcite .",
    "hence , in the geometrical dirac - nambu - goto approach , the thick solutions appear to deviate significantly from the thin ones near the axis of the system , and thus , our perturbative approach around the thin solution can not provide regular thick solutions for @xmath127 . in order to study the subcritical solutions and the thickness corrections to the phase transition in the general case , one needs to solve equation ( [ lagp ] ) in a non - perturbative way . in the following section we write down the explicit euler - lagrange equation for the non - perturbative problem , but due to its very complicated form",
    "we do not discuss its solution in the present paper .",
    "we rather stay with our perturbative approach and complete its full analysis in the next coming sections .    in the following",

    "in the previous section we discussed that the perturbation method ( [ exp ] ) breaks down around @xmath47 ( the vertical axis ) for cases @xmath127 in the minkowski embeddings , and hence one has to consider the full @xmath14-order euler - lagrange equation ( [ lagp ] ) in searching for a regular solution of the curvature corrected problem .",

    "a detailed analysis of this equation , and a systematic , non - perturbative study to find its possible regular solutions would take us far from our essentially perturbative approach , and hence it lies beyond the scope of the present paper .",

    "this implies that small thickness perturbations induced by curvature corrections in the effective brane action do not change the qualitative behavior of the transition in the dimension where a regular perturbative solution exists .    to make the effects of the corrections visible , we enlarged the region where the perturbations are getting larger , i.e.  near the singularity .",

    "it is very important to note however , that the obtained results are valid only for the exceptional cases where the problem can be regularly solved within the perturbative approach . in principle , one can expect a different solution to the thick brane equation with a non - perturbative treatment in the subcritical cases , thus the behavior of the phase transition can also be expected to be different from the picture above .",
    "in this paper we studied thickness perturbations to static , @xmath7-dimensional , dirac - nambu - goto branes embedded into higher dimensional , spherically symmetric , black hole spacetimes .",
    "the perturbations originate from higher order , curvature corrections added to the thin brane action @xcite , and are quadratic in the thickness of the brane . following the treatment of @xcite , and applying a linear perturbation method with the perturbation parameter @xmath92",
    ", we derived the general form of the perturbation equation for a brane that is axisymmetric and has a form of a @xmath9-dimensional plane at asymptotic infinity .    from the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the perturbation equation , we found that there is no regular solution of the perturbed problem in the minkowski embedding case , unless the brane is a string , or a sheet .",
    "this restriction , however does not hold for the black hole embedding solutions , which are always regular within our perturbative approach .    from the above results and also from the similar findings of @xcite",
    ", we concluded that the absence of regular solutions above the dimension @xmath5 implies , that the problem can not be solved within perturbative approaches around the thin solution which is not smooth on the axis of the system .",
    "hence , for a general discussion , one needs to find a new , exact solution of the curvature corrected problem , that is expected to behave differently from the thin solution with being smooth on the axis .",
    "finding this new solution however seems to be a difficult task , as the equation of motion is a very complicated and highly nonlinear one .    after the above conclusions",
    ", we provided the solution of the perturbation equation for various brane ( @xmath7 ) and bulk ( @xmath6 ) dimensions .",
    "the far distance equations are integrated analytically , while the near horizon solutions are obtained by numerical computations .",
    "the deformations of the perturbed brane configurations are plotted and a comparison is made with the corresponding thin brane configurations with identical boundary conditions , for both types of solution .",
    "one motivation of this paper was to consider the effects of higher derivative , curvature corrections on the first order phase transition between the minkowski and black hole branch , that is present in the unperturbed system @xcite . with the solution of the perturbed problem we found that within a perturbative approach , one can consider a phase transition between the two branches only in the cases of @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "we investigated the properties of this transition in the case of a @xmath5 brane , and found that small thickness perturbations do not modify the qualitative behavior of the phase transition , i.e.  it remains a first order one , just as in the case of zero thickness .    since our perturbative approach does not provide a regular thick brane solution for dimensions @xmath2 , we can not answer , in the most general way , the question whether higher order , curvature corrections in the effective brane action can change the order of the phase transition in the bbh system or not .",
