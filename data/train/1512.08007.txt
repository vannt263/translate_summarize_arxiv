    "reconnection inflows and high speed outflows in css have been recognized by lots of observations @xcite .",
    "the speed of outflows ranges from @xmath12  kms@xmath11 .",
    "many studies show that the outflow speed is around @xmath13  kms@xmath11 .",
    "the maximum outflow velocity can reach @xmath14  kms@xmath11 @xcite , which is close to the alfvn velocity in solar corona .",
    "the temperature of the plasmas relating with a magnetic reconnection process can be heated to around 3  mk @xmath15 20  mk .",
    "the 3  mk plasma was observed above the post - flare loops by @xcite in euv with hinode / extreme - ultraviolet imaging spectrometer spectra ; using the solar and heliospheric observatory(soho ) ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer ( uvcs ) data , @xcite observed plasmas with the temperature around 6  mk inside the current sheet region ; the bright blob with hot plasma in the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) @xmath16  passband has been seen with the peak temperature @xmath1511 mk @xcite ; reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager(rhessi ) x - ray spectra and images simultaneously show that the plasma has been heated to @xmath17 10  mk in a solar flare in the paper by @xcite ; @xcite even observed the hot loop plasmas with the peak temperature reaching @xmath1522  mk by rhessi hard x - ray spectra . in the paper by @xcite , the rhessi hard x - ray emissions in figure 6(b ) indicate that some local heating is located at the reconnection site .",
    "the local heating regions possibly correspond to some fine structures like magnetic islands within the current sheet .",
    "they also predict that the sharp change of temperature across the current sheet in figure 7(f ) in their paper is probably a signature of a slow shock .",
    "the generation mechanism of the high temperature emission observed by solar telescopes is still not understood well .",
    "@xcite proposed that both the petschek - like reconnection and turbulent reconnection are possible to explain the hot cs plasma .",
    "the petschek - like reconnection model can be used to explain some observation evidences of white - light , uv and x - ray emissions@xcite . however",
    ", a nonuniform resistivity which should be enhanced at the x - point is required to produce steady - state petschek reconnection(see kulsrud 2001 and references ) .",
    "the physical mechanism about the origin of the enhanced resistivity is still unknown .",
    "@xcite studied the energy conversion mechanism by three - dimensional mhd magnetic reconnection model , they concluded that petschek reconnection accelerates plasma to convert magnetic energy to bulk kinetic energy , then the accelerated plasma becomes slowed down and the bulk kinetic energy is transformed to heat .",
    "the hottest plasma can reach around 40  mk in their simulation .",
    "however , they assumed a non - uniform resistivity , and the corresponding lundquist number at the x - point is only 200 , which is much smaller than that in solar corona ( @xmath18 ) . both radiative cooling and heat conduction effect",
    "are not included in their model .",
    "fast magnetic reconnection develops in a turbulent plasma is expected to produce hot plasma as observed by ucvs and x - ray telescope images@xcite .",
    "several types of reconnection models in turbulent plasma are proposed , e.g. stochastic reconnection@xcite , fractal reconnection or plasmoid instabilities@xcite .",
    "these models have been studied analytically and numerically in the past few years , and some common charicteristics were found . in a high lundquist number environment , plenty of observations , numerical simulations@xcite and even laboratory experiments@xcite show that multiple levels of plasmoids can always occur in an unstable magnetic reconnection process .",
    "numerical simulations have demonstrated that the reconnection rate @xmath19 can be strongly increased to a high value(@xmath20)@xcite after multiple levels of plasmoid instabilities appear , and @xmath19 weakly depends on lundquist number .",
    "this value is very close to the reconnection rate measured by observations@xcite .",
    "however , few numerical simulations focus on the generation of hot plasma inside the current sheet during plasmoid instabilities . in the paper by @xcite , the plasma densityis ( @xmath21 )",
    "is set much higher than that in the corona environment , and the temperature can only be increased from 1  mk to around 2  mk .",
    "the spectrum studies are important for understanding the energy conversion mechanism and dynamics of plasmoids during the plasmoid instabilities . in the papers by @xcite , one dimensional magnetic and kinetic energy spectra along the current sheet",
    "have been studied detailedly .",
    "the results show that the spectrum is not a single power law form for both magnetic and kinetic energy , the spectral index increases with the wave number after secondary islands appear .",
    "the average spectral index for magnetic energy is around 2.0 and it is around 3.0 for kinetic energy in the previous studies @xcite .",
    "these values are larger than the kolmogorov spectral index ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the plasmoid distribution function has also been studied detailedly in some previous papers , e.g. @xcite .",
    "their results also demonstrate that the spectrum of the distribution function does not behave as a single power law .    in this work",
    ", we study the energy conversion during plasmoid instabilities in the solar corona current sheet .",
    "the physical parameters such as the initial temperature , density and strength of magnetic field in the simulations are close to those in real corona environment .",

    "though , the energy conversion process in a flare current sheet has already been studied detailedly in some previous papers ( e.g. , reeves et al .",
    "compared with these previous studies , a more realistic temperature dependent high lundquist number ( @xmath23 ) and much higher resolutions are used in our models .",

    "the detailed calculations about the above variables are similar as those in our previous paper @xcite . however , there are some improvements in this work comparing with our previous paper .",
    "we have used 2.5-dimensional mhd instead of the 2-dimensional mhd equations , open instead of periodic boundaries are used at the top and bottom , radiation cooling and heating terms are also included in this work .",
    "therefore , the @xmath195 components of the magnetic field and velocity should be included to calculate the above variables , the energy flux @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 at the boundaries and the radiated energy @xmath191 have to be included .    figure .",
    "10 shows that the corresponding generated thermal and kinetic energy behave similarly as the dissipated magnetic energy . from beginning to time @xmath181 , the total dissipated magnetic energy exactly equal the generated thermal energy plus kinetic energy , the errors are under @xmath199 .",
    "the magnetic energy is mostly converted to kinetic energy before secondary islands appear , e.g. , the generated kinetic energy is around four times higher than the generated thermal energy from beginning to @xmath200  s@xmath201@xmath156 in case b with @xmath62 .",
    "after secondary islands appear , the generated thermal energy grows much faster with time than the kinetic energy , and there are more generated thermal energy than kinetic energy eventually .",
    "the small scale slow - mode shocks attached to the edges of the multiple magnetic islands play important roles in generating thermal energy .",
    "5 , and 7 clearly show that the highest temperature structures always appear at the shock front regions . in the previous papers by @xcite",
    ", they also pointed out that the energy dissipation is accomplished via many concurrent small - scale events appearing in multiple sites distributed in space . in order to inspect the effects of joule heating ,",
    "the generated thermal energy and joule heating have been calculated in several fixed regions during a period . as long as the slow - mode shocks are included in these regions",
    ", we find that the generated thermal energy is always much larger than the joule heating in a fixed period . therefore , joule heating is not the main reason to cause the sharply increasing thermal energy .",
    "though the generated kinetic energy increases slower than thermal energy after secondary islands appear , there is still around @xmath202 of the dissipated magnetic energy which has been converted to kinetic energy from beginning to @xmath203  s@xmath204@xmath156 in case b. this is different from the result in our previous paper @xcite , after secondary islands appear , the generated kinetic energy decreases fast to a small value and around @xmath205 of the dissipated magnetic energy has been transformed to thermal energy eventually in that paper .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions applied in @xmath56 direction in the paper by @xcite is the main reason to cause this difference .",
    "the outflow plasmas are confined inside the simulation domain by periodic boundary conditions , they collide with the primary island at the top and slow down eventually . the outflow plasmas in this present work can gradually escape from the top boundary because of the open boundary conditions . from figure .",
    "10(a ) , one can also see that the magnetic energy is dissipated faster and more thermal energy is generated in case b with @xmath62 than that in case a with @xmath61 during a period after secondary islands appear .",
    "the reason is that the plasma in the lower @xmath2 case can be compressed more strongly and the shock heating becomes more important in the energy conversion process .",
    "the termination shocks at the head of plasmoids also contribute a small part of the generated thermal energy .",
    "part of the kinetic energy of the reconnection out flows can be converted to thermal energy at the termination shocks . in figure .  5",
    ", one can see that the temperature increases at the termination shock above the primary island .",
    "however , the temperature of the heated plasma at the termination shock is much lower than the highest temperature at the slow - mode shock fronts .    at the fragment current sheet regions where the slow - mode shocks are not included , the heating by dynamic viscosity has been measured to compare with joule heating .",
    "the joule heating can be measured as @xmath206 , and the viscous heating is measured as @xmath207 . at the small current sheet fragments , the current density @xmath208 is around @xmath209  am@xmath210 , the maximum @xmath211 is calculated around 10  s@xmath11 , the magnetic diffusion @xmath38 is around @xmath212m@xmath10s@xmath11 and @xmath213kgm@xmath11s@xmath11 .",
    "then , we can find that @xmath214 is around @xmath215 .",
    "therefore , the heating by dynamic viscosity can be ignored at the fragment current sheet regions in this work .",
    "the one - dimensional energy spectra along the reconnection current sheet have been studied numerically in some papers @xcite .",
    "after secondary islands appear , the numerical results in these previous papers demonstrate that the energy spectrum does not behave as a simple power law anymore .",
    "the spectral index for both kinetic and magnetic energy varies with wave number , it usually increases to a higher value as the wave number increases . before studying the two - dimension spectra , we present the one - dimensional spectra along the current sheet for case b in figure .  11 . the similar method as that in our previous papers @xcite has been used to get the spectral index for both kinetic and magnetic energy .",
    "firstly , each component of magnetic field , velocity and density along the current sheet at @xmath145 has to be transformed to fourier space .",
    "then , the magnetic energy spectrum is calculated as @xmath216 and the kinetic energy spectrum is @xmath217 .",
    "finally , we fit the spectrum to a power law ( @xmath218 and @xmath219 ) to obtain the energy spectrum index . figure .",
    "11 shown that the spectra also do not behave as a simple power law after secondary islands appear .",
    "we only fit a line to get the spectrum index @xmath220 within the region @xmath221 and @xmath222 within the region @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , the spectral index we have obtained is an average value .",
    "the spectral index is larger before secondary islands appear for both kinetic and magnetic energy spectrum .",
    "after secondary islands appear , the spectra become harder .",
    "the index for magnetic energy spectra decreases to around @xmath3 and the one for kinetic energy spectra is around @xmath224 .",
    "these characteristics are very similar as those one - dimensional energy spectra presented in the previous papers@xcite .",
    "however , we should note that the values of these spectral index vary in an range , they are not precisely fixed . in the paper by @xcite , the one dimensional spectral index for the magnetic energy is @xmath225 at @xmath226 .",
    "but such a index varies with time as shown in the papers by @xcite , it is normally in the range @xmath227 for the magnetic energy spectrum after secondary islands appear .",
    "we have chosen the level 5 data to plot figure .",
    "11(b ) and ( c ) . at @xmath131",
    "s , the current sheet is smooth and no secondary islands appear , the highest refinement level is 4 .",
    "therefore , the level 4 data is used for plotting figure .",
    "11(a ) .    for the first time",
    ", we have studied the two - dimensional energy spectra for both kinetic and magnetic energy .",
    "firstly , the magnetic field , velocity and mass density in the region @xmath228 and @xmath229 are transformed to the two - dimensional fourier space .",
    "then , we calculated the two - dimensional magnetic and kinetic energy as @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "there are @xmath232 grids in @xmath4 direction and @xmath233 grids in @xmath5 direction .",
    "@xmath4 is defined as @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 , ... , @xmath238 , and @xmath5 is defined as @xmath234 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , ... ,",
    "@xmath243 are the length scales we have selected in @xmath53 and @xmath56 direction , respectively .",
    "the two - dimensional distributions of @xmath244 for @xmath131  s and @xmath132  s are presented in figure .",
    "12 . since the high energy parts of the two dimensional spectra are mostly located at the positions with small @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in order to see the distributions of the two dimensional spectrum more clearly .",
    "the imaginary parts of the spectra with negative coordinates are also presented in figure .",
    "we have also zoomed into a smaller scale within @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "then , one can clearly see that the high energy parts are located in the center of the plots . in figure .",
    "12 , we only need to focus in the first quadrant ( the top right quadrant ) with positive coordinates in the two panels .",
    "the dark red color represents the highest magnetic energy and the dark blue color represents the lowest one . at @xmath131",
    "s before secondary islands appear , the distribution of magnetic energy in fourier space is relatively smooth and the high magnetic energy is confined in the region near @xmath247 . at @xmath135",
    "s after secondary islands appear , part of the high energy is obviously spread in to the space with larger @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "as we know , the larger the wave number is , the smaller the wave length is .",
    "these evidences prove further that plasmoid instabilities can cause multiple levels of fine structures in the reconnection regions .",
    "the magnetic energy can be cascaded to smaller and smaller scales , and it is dissipated in these small scales eventually . comparing with a one dimensional spectrum ,",
    "the two dimensional ones show how asymmetric the spectra look like and give more detailed information . in the right panel of figure .",
    "12 , one can clearly see that the magnetic energy is not uniformly cascaded in to the the fourier space after secondary islands appear , and most of the magnetic energy is still confined in the scales with small @xmath5 .",
    "the level 4 data have been used to derive figure .  12 .",
    "the distributions of the two - dimensional kinetic energy spectra which we do not show here is very similar as the magnetic energy spectrum shown in figure  12 .",
    "the plasmoid distribution function is also important for revealing the statistical properties and understanding the dynamics of these plasmoids .",
    "following the same method as @xcite and @xcite did , we have also calculated the plasmoid distribution function @xmath248 numerically .",
    "@xmath249 is the number of plasmoids with magnetic flux larger than @xmath7 .",
    "the magnetic flux of a magnetic island is calculated by @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is the magnetic flux at the @xmath149-point of the magnetic island and @xmath252 is the magnetic flux at the nearby @xmath84-point . for obtaining the plasmoid distribution function presented in figure .  13 ,",
    "plasmoids appearing in different snapshots with an interval of @xmath253 are accumulated during the evolution of the current sheet .",
    "13 shows that the plasmoid distribution function behaves as a power law closer to @xmath6 in the intermediate @xmath7 regime . in the large @xmath7 regime ,",
    "the distribution function @xmath254 gradually deviates from the power law @xmath255 to a more rapid falloff .",
    "studying the energy conversion and spectra of a corona current sheet are very important to understand the physical mechanisms of magnetic reconnection and to explain many observational features in flares . in this work",
    "we have simulated a 2.5-dimensional corona current sheet with more realistic physical parameters , the temperature dependent high lundquist number ( @xmath212 ) has been used , both the radiation cooling and heating terms are included . here is a summary of the main results .    \\1 .",
    "after the sweet - parker long current sheet is broken to multiple fragments , many petschek - like fine structures with slow - mode shocks attached at the edges of the plasmoids are formed . unlike the classical petschek slow - mode shocks , these shock structures are not steady and they can be distorted by the colliding plasmoids and turbulent outflows .",
    "lots of turbulent structures appear inside the multiple plasmoids and in the down flow region .",
    "the termination shocks can also be formed above the primary magnetic island and at the head of secondary islands .",
    "these shocks play important roles in generating thermal energy in a corona current sheet .",
    "\\2 . for a numerical simulation with initial conditions @xmath62",
    ", @xmath59  t and @xmath256  kg m@xmath66 , about @xmath257 of the dissipated magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy before secondary islands appear .",
    "after multiple slow - mode shocks appear at the edges of the magnetic islands , the generated thermal energy increases sharply , about @xmath258 of the dissipated magnetic energy can be transformed to thermal energy eventually .",
    "the one dimensional energy spectra along the current sheet at @xmath145 have been studied .",
    "after secondary islands appear , the average spectrum index for kinetic energy is around @xmath224 and it is around @xmath3 for the magnetic energy spectrum .",
    "these spectra do not behave as a simple power law and the spectrum index increases with the wave number , which are similar as the previous studies @xcite .",
    "for the first time , we have studied the two - dimensional energy spectra of the corona current sheet . comparing with the one dimensional spectra , two dimensional spectra",
    "intuitively show that part of the high energy is cascaded to larger @xmath4 and @xmath5 space after secondary islands appear .",
    "the spectra are asymmetric in the fourier space , most of the energy is always confined in the region with small @xmath5 .",
    "the plasmoid distribution function has been calculated numerically by @xmath248 .",
    "it behaves as a power law closer to @xmath6 in the intermediate @xmath7 regime , which is the same as the result from @xcite . in the large @xmath7 regime ,",
    "the distribution function @xmath254 gradually deviates from the power law @xmath255 to a more rapid falloff .",
    "however , the exponential tail in the large @xmath7 regime as presented in the paper by @xcite is not clearly identified from our data presented in figure .",
    "it is probably because that we only use the snapshots before @xmath259  s of case  b data and the plasmoids we have identified are still relative small .",
    "as we know , the effect of heat conduction can smooth out the temperature in solar corona magnetic reconnection events .",
    "the numerical simulations in the papers by @xcite have proved this point .",
    "our previous paper @xcite also studied the effect of anisotropic heat conduction on the magnetic reconnection process . since the time step @xmath260 for explicit scheme used in the nirvana code",
    "is limited by cfl condition , @xmath261 , where @xmath262 is the space step and @xmath263 is the thermal conductivity coefficient .",
    "after secondary islands and smaller scale current sheet fragments appear , the extremely small @xmath262 and large @xmath263 make the time step @xmath260 becoming too small to continue the simulations for including the heat conduction in both case a and case b. therefore , the heat conduction terms are not included in this work .",
    "the characteristic time scales of heat conduction in both the directions parallel and perpendicular to magnetic fields have been analytically calculated to compare with the alfvn crossing time .",
    "we find that the heat conduction effect could be very efficient at the high temperature regions in the direction parallel to magnetic fields , but it can be ignored in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic fields . as shown in figure .  5 and 7 ,",
    "much higher temperatures and steep temperature gradients are built up in the plasmoids and at the slow - mode shocks and x - points .",
    "conductive energy transport from these regions into the inflow regions and into the big plasmoid at the bottom end of the current sheet is largely directed across the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , even though the anisotropic heat conduction is included , the high temperature plasmas can still be confined inside the plasmoids in 2.5-dimensional simulations .",
    "but , the heat conduction can be efficient in the third direction and the maximum temperature in plasmoids ( flux ropes ) will become smaller in full three dimensional space than that in 2.5-dimensional simulations .    as mentioned in the paper by brta et al.(2011a , 2011b ) , the actual physical mechanism that provides",
    "the energy transfer from the global scales , at which the energy is accumulated , to the much smaller scales , at which the plasma - kinetic dissipation takes place , is an open issue .",
    "the spectrum studies presented in figure .",
    "11 , 12 and 13 prove that the multiple cascading process is happening or already happened in the current sheet region , both kinetic and magnetic energy are cascaded from large scales to small scales during the plasmoid cascading process .",
    "therefore , such kind of turbulent reconnection with multiple dynamic structures can explain well the energy transfer process in the solar flare eruption .",
    "the hxr and radio observations ( e.g. , karlick et al . 1996 , 2000 ) also indicate that the particle acceleration takes place via multiple concurrent small - scale events distributed turbulently in the flare volume , rather than by a single compact acceleration process hosted by a single diffusion region .",
    "such observations are usually referred to as signatures of fragmented / chaotic energy release in flares .",
    "the spectra presented in figure .",
    "11 , 12 and 13 can not be directly compared with the observation spectra right now . in the future",
    ", we hope that the dynamic structures in the plasmoid instability process in our simulations can be used to study the particle acceleration by the testing particle method ( e.g. , li & lin 2012 ) .",
    "a huge number of particles can be placed separately in the dynamic structures with turbulent current sheet fragments , slow - mode shocks or fast - mode shocks .",
    "then we can analyze how these particles will be accelerated and calculate the particle energy spectrum distributions . according to these spectra",
    ", one can expect to find out the contributions of turbulent current sheet fragments , slow - mode shocks and fast - mode shocks to particle accelerations separately .",
    "finally , these spectra about the particle energy and number density distributions can be compared with observations .",
