    "one of the most important notions in physics is a state , which includes full information at one moment of the system . in quantum theory , it is thought that the density operator , i.e. , a positive operator with a unit trace , gives the representation of a quantum state that includes not only pure states ( vector states , or wave functions ) but also mixed ones . with a given density operator @xmath2",
    ", one will derive any data  expectation value @xmath3  of an observable @xmath4 through the formula : @xmath5 however , since the density operator is not composed of measurable quantities directly available to experimentalists , the question of how to determine the state with experimental data remains as a non - trivial problem .",
    "therefore , it is important to consider another state representation consisting of purely experimental data ( actual measurements )",
    ".    for quantum systems with finite levels , where the dimension of the associated hilbert space @xmath6 is @xmath7 , the bloch vector @xcite is one of the candidates that meets the above requirement : let @xmath8s @xmath9 be orthogonal generators of @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "appendix [ sec : generatorsossun ] ) that satisfy @xmath10 with the identity operator @xmath11 , @xmath8s form an orthogonal basis of the set of all the linear operators with respect to the hilbert - schmidt inner product ; and hence any density operator @xmath2 can be written in the form : @xmath12 where use has been made of @xmath13 and @xmath14 from the formula .",
    "physically this means that we only need to know expectation values of @xmath8s to determine the state ( density operator ) .",
    "this brings us to another representation of a quantum state by regarding @xmath15s themselves as a state ; the bloch vector @xmath16 is defined by a vector in @xmath17 with components being expectation values of @xmath8s : @xmath18 and from eq .",
    "the corresponding density operator @xmath2 is given by the map @xmath19    while the definition of the bloch vector is simple as above , it is difficult to know the space ( range ) of the bloch vectors ; there remains the problem of finding the set of all the bloch vectors  the bloch - vector space @xmath20  which is bijectively connected by map to the set @xmath21 of all density operators : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the set of all linear operators on @xmath6 .",
    "so far , there have been many efforts @xcite to determine @xmath20 for @xmath0-level systems , and some of its general properties are known : it is a closed convex set in @xmath17 , since @xmath21 is a closed convex set and map is linear homeomorphic .",
    "it is a subset of the large ball @xmath24 with radius @xmath25 @xcite , which is the minimum ball that includes @xmath20 .",
    "all the pure states are on the surface of this ball and the states on it are pure @xcite ; however the points on the surface are not necessarily physical states . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath20 includes the small ball @xmath26 with radius @xmath27 @xcite , which is the maximum ball included in @xmath20 @xcite : @xmath28 only in @xmath29-level systems ( @xmath30 ) does it follow that @xmath31 and the bloch - vector space comes to be a ball , which is well known as the bloch ball @xcite .",
    "however , the inclusive relations do not coincide when @xmath32 , and @xmath20 has not been determined until quite recently : in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath20 was analytically determined for arbitrary @xmath0-level systems , clarifying the origin of the different structures between @xmath29-level and @xmath0-level systems ( @xmath33 ) . from the physical point of view , the determination gives a theoretical prediction of the range of data that will be measured in experiment , and the analytic forms can be used for such a purpose . however , unlike the @xmath29-level case , the forms in higher - level systems are quite complex , and it is still hard to understand the geometrical character of the space , although the geometrical knowledge of state space is quite useful for comprehending global aspects , in connection with experiments , of not only the state but also the dynamics . therefore , it is still worth trying to understand the bloch - vector space , especially its geometrical character , which gives us an overall picture of the space .    in this letter",
    ", we will investigate the structure of the bloch - vector space with a different strategy from that of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely from the spherical - coordinate point of view .",
    "we reveal that not a maximum but a minimum spectrum of orthogonal generators of @xmath1 of each direction determines the space ( theorem [ thm : main ] in sec .  [ sec : radiusofbs ] ) .",
    "this provides clear perception about a geometry of the space and , as one of the applications , we will show a dual property of the bloch - vector space ( theorem [ eq : dual ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : dual ] ) : if in some direction the space reaches the surface of large ball @xmath34 ( pure state ) , then in the opposite direction it can only reach the surface of small ball @xmath26 , and vice versa . as an another application",
    ", we show that spherical coordinate of the bloch vector could be a useful parameterization of density operators ( sec .",
    "[ sec : para ] ) for the purpose of numerical experiments . in the final section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] ) , we discuss state - representations based on actual measurements beyond the bloch - vector representation . we provide three classes ( c1 ) , ( c2 ) , and ( c3 ) , where ( c3 ) is that of the bloch vector , clarifying its physical and mathematical reasons in choosing special observables to represent quantum state .",
    "we also discuss their state spaces and show theorem [ thm : main ] still holds for class ( c2 )",
    ". this fact will be helpful in the search for more useful state - representation than that of the bloch vector .",
    "we begin by recalling a basic property in probability theory that an expectation value takes its value between minimum and maximum values of the random variable .",
    "this applies also in quantum theory where spectra of an observable determine its range . in the meantime , since components @xmath35 of the bloch vector are expectation values of orthogonal generators @xmath36 , their ranges are restricted between minimum eigenvalue @xmath37 and maximum eigenvalue @xmath38 of @xmath8 : @xmath39 this simple fact might give information on the bloch - vector space , and indeed the space should be restricted as @xmath40 however , this restriction never determines the space exactly  the inclusive relation is always proper .",
    "let us explain this situation in a @xmath29-level system , where the bloch - vector space @xmath41 corresponds to the bloch ball with radius @xmath42 : the spectrum of the generators @xmath43 ( pauli s spin operators ) are @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 , and eq",
    ".   comes to be @xmath46 where the right - hand side gives not the ball but a cube .",
    "one should consider why the above consideration was not enough to determine the bloch - vector space",
    ". generally speaking , when an expectation value achieves the maximum ( or minimum ) eigenvalue , the state should be the eigenstate of the corresponding observable .",
    "however , since not all the generators @xmath8 are commutative with each other , the cases where the equalities in eq .   of non - commutative @xmath8",
    "s hold are prohibited by the principle of quantum mechanics  non - commutative observables do not generally have simultaneous eigenstates",
    ".    however , we can further proceed to investigate the space using the same philosophy .",
    "although in the above discussion , the expectation values are only considered for each @xmath47 , one can consider the same restriction for @xmath48 in all directions @xmath49 .",
    "this can be done by considering the spherical - coordinate of the bloch vector ; @xmath50 in each direction @xmath49 , where the corresponding density operator is @xmath51 note that the radius @xmath52 of the bloch vector is the expectation value of @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 , since @xmath55 and @xmath56 . by applying the basic property of the expectation value , @xmath52 is bounded above by the maximum eigenvalue @xmath57 of @xmath53 @xcite : @xmath58 this provides us stronger restriction of the bloch - vector space than that achieved by eq .",
    ": @xmath59 this is of importance especially in a @xmath29-level system ; since every @xmath53 has eigenvalues @xmath44 independent of the direction @xmath60 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : evofog ] for details ) and hence @xmath61 , eq .",

    "[ sec : dual ] .",
    "this fact , on first sight , tells us that the information of the spectra of generators @xmath1 is generally not enough to determine the bloch - vector space .",
    "however , we will show ( in theorem [ thm : main ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : radiusofbs ] ) that the bloch - vector space is completely determined by the spectra  by not the maximum but the minimum eigenvalue @xmath63 of generator @xmath53  in the form @xmath64 instead of eq .  .",
    "this is nothing but a construction of the bloch - vector space from the spherical - coordinate point of view .",
    "let us again consider the spherical coordinate of the bloch vector ; @xmath50 in each direction @xmath49 , where the corresponding density operator is given by eq .  .",
    "since @xmath20 is a closed bounded convex set that includes origin @xmath65 @xcite , there exists the maximum radius @xmath66 in each direction @xmath67 : @xmath68 from relations , we know the restrictions : @xmath69 on the other hand , from eq .",

    "then , @xmath74    * proof *    before proving this , let us note that operator @xmath75 for any direction @xmath60 satisfies @xmath76 as are easily proved from eqs .  .",
    "from these properties , one obtains @xmath77 ( from ( i ) in eqs .  , all the eigenvalues @xmath78 of @xmath53 are real , while the corresponding eigenvectors form a complete orthonormal system ; hence , the first equality holds .",

    "in which all the eigenvalues are 0 .",

    "it is enough to check the range of @xmath52 where the positivity of @xmath84 is satisfied : @xmath85 from eq .",
    ", this is equivalent to @xmath86 since @xmath87 is the maximum @xmath52 of this range , eq .",
    "we expect that theorem [ thm : main ] gives another comprehensive perspective of the bloch - vector space ; namely , it enables us to capture the bloch - vector space in the sense that all the information of the space is accumulated in that of the minimum eigenvalues of generators .",
    "although this characterization of the bloch - vector space has yet to give an explicit determination of the space as achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are no difficulties in determining the space in numerical computation ( see appendix [ 2dimsec ] ) . in the next section",

    "appendix [ sec : generatorsossun ] ) . using these bases , eq .   becomes @xmath252 where the normalization condition @xmath13 automatically satisfies in this form .",
    "from this equation , one can consider @xmath253-dimensional real vector @xmath254 itself a representation of quantum state where normalization condition is naturally included from the beginning .",
    "the class ( c2 ) of the quantum - state representation is that composed of such representations .",
    "( c3 ) * quantum - state representation by the bloch vector *    now it is obvious that the representation by the bloch vector is the special case in class ( c2 ) where the set of observables are orthogonal generators of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "namely , we require also orthogonality condition between @xmath245s",
    ". since there are still as many orthogonal generators of @xmath1 as there are elements of @xmath255 , each choice provides different bloch - vector representation , and we call this class ( c3 ) .    although the orthogonality condition among @xmath245s might make some calculations easy , it seems that this is a purely mathematical condition without particular physical meaning .",
    "even when one considers only this point , it is interesting to proceed to ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) representations beyond ( c3 ) of the bloch - vector representation .    * state space for classes ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) *    when introducing state - representation , it is of importance to discuss its state - space .",
    "in particular , when understanding its geometrical character , it is helpful to comprehend global information of not only states but also dynamics",
    ".    we note that almost the same discussion as in sec .",
    "[ sec : radiusofbs ] using the spherical - coordinate view can be applied to the classes ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the state space of the class ( c2 ) , the same characterization as that of bloch vectors ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) holds when changing @xmath53 to @xmath256 and removes factor @xmath29 , since the orthogonality condition ( iii ) is not used in that proof . as we know that the bloch - vector space has a quite complex structure except in a @xmath29-level system , it would be interesting to investigate another representation in class ( c2 ) by finding some generators of @xmath1 whose minimum eigenvalues can be characterized with simple conditions ; then from theorem [ thm : main ] the state - space would be simpler than that of the bloch vector .",
    "we have discussed the bloch - vector space from the spherical - coordinate point of view and showed that the radius is determined not by the maximum but the minimum eigenvalue of generators @xmath53 in each direction ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) . compared with the analytic determination in ref .",
    "@xcite , theorem [ thm : main ] brings us to understand some geometrical characters in the complex structure of the space , like theorem [ eq : dual ] , proposition [ prop : maxdet1 ] , and proposition [ prop : maxdet2 ] : when there is a prominence which goes to the large ball , namely to some pure state , then in opposite side the space can only reach the small ball , and vice versa , etc .",
    "these give us an overall picture of the bloch - vector space , even in higher - level cases .",
    "the physical meaning of this theorem is also interesting ; since the radius @xmath52 of the bloch vector is related to the purity @xmath257 by @xmath258 , if there is a pure state in some direction , in the opposite direction one has to give up the high purity . on the other hand ,",
    "if in some direction the purity is low enough , then in the opposite direction one can get high purity .",
    "the knowledge of the geometry of the state - space provides also other applications , like a positive map , which can be used as a dynamical map , or even a tool to distinguish separable and entanglement @xcite .",
    "we also introduced classes of quantum - state representations based on actual measurements , beyond the description by the bloch vector .",
    "in particular , the state space of class ( c2 ) can be characterized in the same manner as theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "we believe that there exists more useful representation than that of the bloch vector in the sense that the state - space has simpler structure , and theorem [ thm : main ] would be useful for the search of such representation since it tells us that all the information of the state - space lies in minimum eigenvalues of observable in each direction .",
