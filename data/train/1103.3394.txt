    "dynamical properties of many particle system can generally be studied by employing an external perturbation , which disturbs the system only slightly from its equilibrium state , and thus measuring the spontaneous response / fluctuations of the system to this external perturbation . in general , the fluctuations are related to the correlation function through the symmetry of the system , which provides important inputs for quantitative calculations of complicated many - body system .",
    "also , many of the properties of the deconfined strongly interacting matter are reflected in the structure of the correlation and the spectral functions  @xcite of the vector current .",
    "the static thermal dilepton rate describing the production of lepton pairs is related to the spectral function in the vector current  @xcite . within the hard thermal loop perturbation theory ( htlpt )",
    "the vector spectral function has been obtained  @xcite , which is found to diverge due to its spatial part at the low energy regime .",
    "this is due to the fact that the htl quark - photon vertex is inversely proportional to the photon energy and it sharply rises at zero photon energy . on the other hand , the fluctuations of conserved quantities , such as baryon number and electric charge , are considered to be a signal  @xcite for quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation in heavy - ion experiments .",
    "these conserved density fluctuations are closely related to the temporal correlation function in the vector channel through derivatives of a thermodynamic quantity associated with the symmetry , known as the thermodynamic sum rule  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the temporal part of the spectral function associated with the symmetry should be a finite quantity and would not encounter any such infrared divergence unlike the spatial part at low energy .",
    "a very recent lattice calculation  @xcite in quenched approximation has obtained the temporal part of the euclidian correlation function associated with the response of the conserved density fluctuations , which is found to be a finite quantity . in view of this",
    "we would like to compute the temporal correlation function in the vector channel from the quark number susceptibility associated with the quark number density fluctuations within the htlpt  @xcite and to compare it with recent lattice data  @xcite in quenched approximation .",
    "the temporal correlator follows from the qcd polarization diagram .",
    "to lowest order perturbation theory it is given by the one - loop diagram containing bare quark propagators .",
    "the htl resummation technique provides a consistent perturbative expansion for gauge theories at finite temperature by using htl resummed propagators and vertices @xcite . as in usual perturbation theory",
    "it is strictly applicable only in the weak coupling limit but takes into account all dynamical effects .",
    "going beyond the lowest order perturbation theory in the case of the temporal correlator , we use htl resummed quark propagators and quark - gluon vertices in the polarization diagram ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the htl resummed quark propagators correspond to static external quarks ( valence quarks ) . within this approximation",
    "no internal quark - loops appear . in this sense",
    "our approximation can be compared to results from quenched lattice qcd .",
    "the inclusion of dynamical quark - loops requires to consider higher - order diagrams within the htl resummed perturbation theory in which htl resummed gluon propagators will show up .",
    "however , we do not expect a significant change in the result as higher contributions give less than 5% corrections in the case of thermodynamic quantities such as pressure @xcite .",
    "of course , close to the transition temperature higher order effects may become important  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we briefly discuss some generalities on correlation functions , fluctuation and its response ( susceptibility ) associated with conserved charges .",
    "in sec.iii we obtain the relation between the response of the density fluctuation of the conserved charge and the corresponding temporal part of the euclidian correlation function in the vector current .",
    "next we compute them in htlpt  @xcite and compare with lattice data .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec.vi .",
    "in this section we summarize some of the basic relations and also describe in details their important features relevant as well as required for our purpose .",
    "the two - point correlation function  @xcite of the vector current , @xmath6 with three point function @xmath7 , is defined at fixed momentum @xmath8 as @xmath9 where the euclidian time @xmath10 is restricted to the interval @xmath11 $ ]",
    ". the thermal two - point vector correlation function in coordinate space , @xmath12 , can be written as @xmath13 where the fourier transformed correlation function @xmath14 is given at the discrete matsubara modes , @xmath15 .",
    "the imaginary part of the momentum space correlator gives the spectral function @xmath16 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes ( temporal , spatial , vector ) .",
    "we have also introduced the vector spectral function as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the sum over the three space - space components and @xmath21 is the time - time component of @xmath22 .    using ( [ vec_cor ] ) and ( [ spec_mom ] ) in ( [ cor_p ] ) the spectral representation of the thermal correlation functions at fixed momentum can be obtained  @xcite as @xmath23}{\\sinh[\\omega\\beta/2 ] } \\ . \\label{corr_mom}\\ ] ] we note that the euclidian correlation function is usually restricted to vanishing three momentum , @xmath24 , in the analysis of lattice gauge theory and one can write @xmath25 .    a finite temperature lattice gauge theory calculation is performed on lattices with finite temporal extent @xmath5 , which provides information on the euclidian correlation function , @xmath26 , only for a discrete and finite set of euclidian times @xmath27 .",
    "the vector correlation function , @xmath28 , had been computed  @xcite within the quenched approximation of qcd using non - perturbative improved clover fermions  @xcite through a probabilistic application based on the maximum entropy method ( mem )  @xcite for temporal extent @xmath29 and spatial extent @xmath30 .",
    "then by inverting the integral in ( [ corr_mom ] ) , the spectral function ) from imaginary time to real time . ] was reconstructed  @xcite in lattice qcd .",
    "the vector spectral functions above the deconfinement temperature ( _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath31 ) show an oscillatory behaviour compared to the free one . in the high energy regime , @xmath32 the vector spectral function , @xmath33 agreed with that of the htlpt  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the lattice spectral functions and dilepton rates  @xcite were found to fall off very fast and became vanishingly small for @xmath34 due to the sharp cut - off used in the reconstruction .    in a very recent lattice analysis  @xcite the low energy behaviour ( _ viz .",
    "_ , downward slope ) of the spatial and vector spectral functions has been improved substantially on lattices up to size @xmath35 by changing the slope upward through a fit to the free plus breit - wigner ( bw ) spectral functions at lower energy limit .",
    "this upward slope in the vector spectral functions in lattice gauge theory  @xcite resembles up to some extent that of the htlpt spectral function  @xcite and dilepton rate  @xcite at low energy regime despite the infrared problem of htlpt at vanishing energy .",
    "nonetheless , the existence of the van hove peaks in the vector spectral function in htlpt  @xcite has not been realized yet in the improved lattice analysis  @xcite , probably due to the ansatz that the lattice spectral function is proportional to that of the free plus bw one in the low energy regime .",
    "the existence of van hove peaks can not yet be ruled out , which are general features of massless fermions  @xcite in a relativistic plasma in the low energy regime .",
    "also , the high energy behaviour of the spectral function agrees well with those of free and htlpt results , respectively , and are in conformity with its earlier analysis on the lattice  @xcite . on the other hand , the temporal component of spectral and",
    "correlation functions associated with the symmetry of the system are finite and do not encounter any infrared problem unlike their spatial part .",
    "now , it would be interesting to analyse the temporal correlation and spectral functions , associated with the symmetry , within htlpt and compare them with those of lattice gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath36 be a heisenberg operator where @xmath37 may be associated with a degree of freedom in the system . in a static and uniform external field @xmath38 , the ( induced ) expectation value of the operator @xmath39 is written  @xcite as @xmath40 } { { \\rm tr}\\left [ e^{-\\beta \\left ( { \\cal h}+{\\cal h}_{ex}\\right ) } \\right ] } = \\frac{1}{v}\\int d^{3}x\\ , \\left\\langle { \\cal o } _ { \\alpha } \\left ( 0,\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf x}\\right ) \\right\\rangle \\ : , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where translational invariance is assumed , @xmath41 is the volume of the system and @xmath42 is given by @xmath43",
    "the ( static ) susceptibility @xmath44 is defined as the rate with which the expectation value changes in response to that external field , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the two point correlation function with operators evaluated at equal times .",
    "there is no broken symmetry as @xmath47",
    "the qns is a measure of the response of the quark number density with infinitesimal change in the quark chemical potential , @xmath48 . under such a situation",
    "the external field , @xmath49 , in ( [ eq2 ] ) can be identified as the quark chemical potential and the operator @xmath50 as the temporal component ( @xmath51 ) of the vector current , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is in general a three point function .",
    "then the qns for a given quark flavour follows from ( [ eq3 ] ) as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the retarded correlation function . to obtain ( [ eq4 ] ) in concise form",
    ", we have used the fluctuation - dissipation theorem given as @xmath56 and the kramers - kronig dispersion relation @xmath57 where @xmath58 is proportional to @xmath59 due to the quark number conservation  @xcite . also the number density for a given quark flavour",

    "the quark number density vanishes if @xmath64 , i.e. , there is no broken cp symmetry .",
    "now , ( [ eq3 ] ) or ( [ eq4 ] ) indicates that the thermodynamic derivatives with respect to the external source are related to the temporal component of the static correlation function associated with the number conservation of the system . this relation in ( [ eq4 ] ) is known as _ the thermodynamic sum rule _",
    "@xcite .",
    "owing to the quark number conservation the temporal spectral function @xmath65 in ( [ spec_mom ] ) becomes @xmath66    using ( [ eq6 ] ) in ( [ corr_mom ] ) , it is straight forward to obtain the temporal correlation function as @xmath67 which is proportional to the qns @xmath68 and @xmath69 , but independent of @xmath10 . the qns has been calculated within the framework of lattice gauge theory @xcite , perturbative qcd  @xcite , nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , polyakov - nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model  @xcite , ads / cft correspondence and holographic qcd  @xcite , renormalisation group approach  @xcite , two loop approximately self - consistent @xmath70-derivable htl resummation  @xcite and htlpt  @xcite .",
    "we note that in a resummed perturbation theory  @xcite , the higher order loops contribute to the lower order due to the fact that the loop expansion and the coupling expansion are not symmetric .",
    "so , unlike conventional perturbation theory  @xcite one needs to take a proper measure in order to calculate a quantity in a given order of @xmath71 correctly using htlpt .",
    "we further note that various htl approaches  @xcite have been used for calculating lo thermodynamic quantities and qns in the literatures , which led to different results within the same approximation .",
    "recently , we have developed a resummed htlpt  @xcite by employing a variation of an external probe that disturbs the system only slightly from its equilibrium positions . in this way the effect of higher order variations of the external source is taken into account , which are essential to get the lo quantities correct .",
    "once this is done the lo quantities in htlpt  @xcite agree with the htl approaches of ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we would like to exploit the lo qns in htlpt obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for our purpose .",
    "because of the structure of the htl propagator  @xcite the lo qns in htlpt contains quasiparticle ( qp ) contributions due to the poles of the htl quark propagator and landau damping ( ld ) contributions due to the space like part of the htl quark propagator .",
    "the qns can be decomposed as @xmath72    the lo qns in htlpt due to qp is obtained  @xcite as @xmath73 \\ , \\label{h8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the ld part is obtained  @xcite as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the fermi - dirac distribution , @xmath76 corresponds to the energy of a quasiparticle having chirality to helicity ratio @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the energy of a mode called plasmino having chirality to helicity ratio @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are the cut spectral functions of the htl quark propagator .",
    "the qp part results in ( [ h8 ] ) is identical to that of the @xmath81-loop approximately self - consistent @xmath70-derivable htl resummation approach of blaizot _ et al _",
    "@xcite . the ld part ( [ l4 ] ) can not be compared directly to the ld part of ref .",
    "@xcite as no closed expression is given there . however , numerical results of the both qns agree very well .",
    "we also note that jiang _",
    "et al _  @xcite used htlpt but did not take into account properly the effect of the variation of the external field to the density fluctuation , which resulted in an overcounting in the lo qns .",
    "moreover , in their approach an ad hoc separation scale is required to distinguish between soft and hard momenta and the thermodynamic sum rule is violated . in the htlpt approach in ref .",
    "@xcite the htl n - point functions were used uniformly for all momenta scale , _",
    "i.e. _ , both soft and hard momenta , which resulted in an overcounting within the lo contribution  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the htl action is accurate only for soft momenta and for hard ones only in the vicinity of light cone .    .",
    "the solid lines are for lo in htlpt whereas the dashed lines are for lo ( proportional to @xmath82 ) in pqcd  @xcite .",
    "the different choices of the renormalisation scale are @xmath83 .",

    "moreover , it also shows the same trend as the available lattice results  @xcite , though there is a large variation among the various lattice results within the improved lattice ( asqtad and p4 ) actions  @xcite due to the higher order discretisation of the relevant operator associated with the thermodynamic derivatives .",
    "a detailed analysis on uncertainties of the ingredients in the lattice qcd calculations is presented in refs .",
    "this calls for further investigation both on the analytic side by improving the htl resummation schemes and on the lattice side by refining the various lattice ingredients .",

    "the lo qns as a response of the conserved density fluctuation in htlpt when compared with the available lattice data with improved lattice actions  @xcite in the literature within their wide variation shows the same trend but deviates from those in certain extent .",
    "the same htl qns is used to compute the temporal part of the euclidian correlation in the vector current which agrees quite well with that of improved lattice gauge theory calculations  @xcite recently performed within the quenched approximation on lattices up to size @xmath103 for a quark mass @xmath0 .",
