    "the emergence of cooperation in evolving populations with exploitative individuals is still a challenging problem in biological and social sciences .",
    "most theories that explain cooperation are based on direct reciprocity , as the famous iterated prisoner s dilemma @xcite .",
    "cooperation can also arise from indirect reciprocity when agents help others only if these are known as sufficiently altruistic @xcite . in most of these models",
    "a finite population of agents is simulated , pairs of agents meet randomly as potential donator and receiver .",
    "a donation involves some cost to the donor while it provides a larger benefit to the receiver .",
    "agents reproduce depending on their payoffs after a certain number of such meetings .",
    "obviously selfish individuals that do not donate would quickly spread in the population if help is not channeled towards more cooperative players . if agents do not meet repeatedly  as in a large population  direct reciprocity does not work .",
    "indirect reciprocity can solve this problems when donations are given only to those individuals that are known as sufficiently helpful .",
    "this mechanism effectively protects a cooperative population against exploiters @xcite .",
    "riolo et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a model in which cooperation is not based on reciprocity , but on similarity . in this model donations are channeled towards individuals that are sufficiently similar to the donator . to distinguish between different groups of individuals every agent @xmath0 has a tag @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "school ties , club memberships , tribal costumes or religious creeds are all tags that induce cooperation .",
    "in addition agents have a tolerance threshold @xmath2 , which determines the tag interval that the agent classifies as its own group .",
    "an agent @xmath0 donates to another agent @xmath3 if their tags are sufficiently similar , @xmath4 .",
    "the cost of such a donation for @xmath0 is @xmath5 while the benefit for @xmath3 is @xmath6 . for simplicity",
    ", @xmath7 is normalized to 1 , since a multiplication of payoffs with a constant factor does not change the game .",
    "initially , the tag and the tolerance threshold are uniformly distributed random numbers . in each generation",
    "every agent acts as a potential donor for @xmath8 other agents chosen at random .",
    "hence it is on average also chosen @xmath8 times as a recipient .",
    "after each generation each agent @xmath0 compares its payoff with the payoff of another randomly chosen agent @xmath3 and adopts @xmath9 and @xmath10 if @xmath3 has a higher payoff .",
    "in addition every agent is subject to mutation . with probability @xmath11",
    "an agent receives a new @xmath12 drawn from a uniform distribution and also with probability @xmath11 a new @xmath13 which is gaussian distributed with standard deviation @xmath14 around the old @xmath13 .",
    "if this new @xmath13 becomes smaller than zero it is set to @xmath15 .",
    "obviously , it seems to be the best strategy for an individual to donate as little as possible , i.e.  to have a very small @xmath13 .",
    "however , the whole population would be better off if everybody would cooperate .",
    "this `` tragedy of the commons '' can be solved in different ways , e.g.  by volunteering @xcite .",
    "riolo et al .",
    "solve this problem by channeling help towards others that are sufficiently similar to the donator . instead of a cooperative population the formation and decay of cooperative clusters",
    "is observed for certain parameter ranges ( high @xmath8 and low @xmath16 , see fig .",
    "[ riolo ] ) .",
    "the average tolerance of a cooperative cluster grows slowly over time .",
    "occasionally it declines sharply .",
    "this decline occurs when the cluster is exploited by agents that are sufficiently similar to the cluster s agents to get support , but do not help themselves .",
    "however , the mechanism that generates these tides of tolerance remained unclear @xcite .",
    "[ ] [ ] [ 1][180]tolerance [ ] [ ] [ 1][180]donationrate , @xmath17 , @xmath18).,title=\"fig : \" ] , @xmath17 , @xmath18).,title=\"fig : \" ]    here we develop a minimal model for tag - based cooperation that displays these `` tides of tolerance '' if there is a net average drift towards more cooperation .",
    "we find that these fluctuations vanish if such a drift is not included in the model .",
    "the importance of this observation stems from the fact that if we have species that can distinguish between themselves and others and donate only to others with the same tag , then this would in the long run lead to a single group of cooperating species having a single tag .",
    "but if we introduce a small rate of biased conversions from intolerant to tolerant species we observe a waxing and waning in time of species with different tags .",
    "in other words , the small conversion rate leads to a coexistence of different species where different species appear cyclically at different times .",
    "this consitutes a new mechanism that generates biodiversity in a group of competing species .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first the model of riolo et al .",
    "is simplified in order to allow an analytical treatment .",
    "then the system without the effects of mutations is analyzed .",
    "thereafter we introduce a drift that increases the tolerance and leads to oscillations of tolerance .",
    "we show that the truncated mutations in the model of riolo et al .",
    "also lead to such a drift .",
    "here we simplify the model of riolo et al .",
    "@xcite in order to allow for an analytical treatment . in a first step we restrict the game to only two tags , red and blue .",
    "similarly we allow only two tolerances .",
    "the agents can either only donate to others bearing the same tag if they have zero tolerance @xmath19 or to every other agent ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this leads to four possible strategies .",
    "then we allow partners to donate and to receive in an single interaction instead of defining different roles for donators and receivers .",
    "we end up with the payoff matrix    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     which describes the prisoners dilemma @xcite .",
    "the stability of the fixed points with only one tag can be calculated as follows . for @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "we find the jacobian matrix @xmath23 with the eigenvalues @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the fixed point is marginal stable as long as @xmath27 , for @xmath28 it becomes unstable .",
    "the reasoning can be adopted for the fixed line @xmath29 .",
    "a fixed point that is conserved for @xmath30 can be found if all players are tolerant . for @xmath31",
    "the jacobian matrix is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix are @xmath24 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is not possible for @xmath22 .",
    "hence the fixed line is instable for @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath30 there is an interval of stability given by @xmath39 .",
    "if this inequation and @xmath40 are both fulfilled by @xmath41 , the biased conversions ensure stability of the fixed point although the replicator dynamics alone would make this point instable .",
    "the first inequation can only be fulfilled for @xmath42 .",
    "for @xmath43 it is always fulfilled and the whole fixed line @xmath44 is stable .    the fixed point given by @xmath45 reduces to the mixed nash equilibrium for @xmath22 .",
    "the jacobi matrix at this fixed point is @xmath46 the eigenvalues of this matrix are @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath22 we have @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the third eigenvalue corresponds to an instable direction .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector is @xmath51 , which is the normal of the separatrix for @xmath22 . in the case of",
    "@xmath30 we have @xmath37 for @xmath38 only if @xmath52 .",
    "hence @xmath53 becomes stable where it coincides with the fixed points @xmath54 described in appendix [ addfpstab ] . in all other cases ,",
    "at least one eigenvalue of @xmath55 is outside the unit circle .",
    "numerical simulations show that the additional fixed points for @xmath30 can always be found in the plane spanned by ( @xmath56 ) , ( @xmath57 ) and ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "together with @xmath59 and @xmath60 we have three equations that describe these points .",
    "two of the solutions are fixed points not described above .",
    "the first fixed points @xmath54 can be written as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 can be calculated by exchanging @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "these fixed points have only real coordinates for @xmath69 . for @xmath70",
    "we have @xmath71 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the jacobi matrix at the fixed points @xmath72 can be calculated numerically . for @xmath73",
    "the fixed points are only stable if @xmath74 . at @xmath75",
    "they collapse with @xmath76 in a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation and form a single stable fixed point .",
    "for @xmath74 the fixed points @xmath72 are the only stable attractors and the order measures described in section [ cooperationcost ] can be calculated analytically .",
    "we find for @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 for @xmath80 the fixed point @xmath53 becomes stable and we find @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
