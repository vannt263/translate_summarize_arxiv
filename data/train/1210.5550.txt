    "there have been clear evidences that the present universe is under accelerating expansion as observed in , e.g. the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , large - scale structure surveys @xcite , supernovae type ia ( snia ) @xcite and x - ray luminosity from galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "one prime explanation is that the acceleration is an effect of a scalar field evolving under its potential to acquire negative pressure with @xmath9 giving repulsive gravity .",
    "form of energy with this negative pressure range is generally called dark energy @xcite .",
    "scalar field is responsible for symmetry breaking mechanisms and super - fast expansion in inflationary scenario , resolving horizon and flatness problems as well as explaining the origin of structures @xcite . introducing a cosmological constant into the field equation is simplest way to have dark energy @xcite , but it creates new problem on fine - tuning of energy density scales @xcite . for the cosmological constant to be viable , idea of varying cosmological constant needs to be installed @xcite . if dark energy is the scalar field , the field could have non - canonical kinetic part such as tachyon which is classified in a type of k - essence models @xcite .",
    "the tachyon field is a negative mass mode of an unstable non - bps d3-brane in string theory @xcite or a massive scalar field on anti - d3 brane @xcite .",
    "it was found that the tachyonic field potential must not be too steep , i.e. less steep than @xmath10 in order to account for the late acceleration @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we considered dark energy in form of tachyonic scalar field in power - law cosmology of which the scale factor scaled as @xmath11 with @xmath12 , corresponding to acceleration if @xmath13 and in addition we also consider phantom power - law cosmology with @xmath14 . in cosmic history , there were epoch when radiation or dust is dominant component in the universe for which the scale factor evolves as power - law @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "a universe with mixed combination of different cosmic ingredients can be modeled using power - law expansion with some approximately constant @xmath17 during a brief period of cosmic time .",
    "adjustability of expansion rate is characterized by only one parameter , @xmath17 which is used widely in astrophysical observations .",
    "there are also other situations that one can obtain the power - law solution .",
    "these are such as non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theory in which the scalar field couples to the curvature contributing to energy density that cancels out the vacuum energy @xcite and simple inflationary model in which the power - law cosmology can avoid flatness and horizon problems and can give simple spectrum @xcite .",
    "the power - law has proved to be a very good phenomenological description of the cosmic evolution , since it can describe radiation epoch , dark matter epoch , and dark energy epoch according to value of the exponent @xcite .",
    "previously linear - coasting cosmology , @xmath18 was analyzed @xcite with motivation from su(2 ) instanton cosmology @xcite , higher order ( weyl ) gravity @xcite , or from scalar - tensor theories @xcite .",
    "however the universe expanding with @xmath19 @xcite was not able to agree with observational constraint from type ia supernovae , hubble rate data from cosmic chronometers and bao @xcite which indicates that @xmath20=const and @xmath21 are not favored by the observations .    for a specific gravity or dark energy model , power - law cosmology",
    "is considered in @xmath22 and @xmath23 gravities @xcite and in the case of which there is coupling between cosmic fluids @xcite .",
    "the power - law cosmology were also studied in context of scalar field cosmology @xcite , phantom scalar field cosmology @xcite .",
    "there is also slightly different form of the power - law function which @xmath24 can evolved with time so that it can parameterize cosmological observables @xcite .    for the power - law to be valid throughout the cosmic evolution , it is not possible with constant exponent .",
    "for example , at big bang primordial nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , @xmath24 is allowed to have maximum value at approximately @xmath25 in order to be capable of light element abundances @xcite @xcite .",
    "the value is about @xmath26 at highly - radiation dominated era , about @xmath27 at highly - dust dominated era and greater than one at present .",
    "low value of @xmath24 results in much younger cosmic age and does not give acceleration . on the other hand @xmath28 value is needed to solve age problem in the cdm model @xcite without flatness and horizon problems . in universe dominated with cold dark matter and dark energy , considering that the power - law expansion happens long after matter - radiation equality era , @xmath29 ( value from @xcite ) , the bbn constraint can be relaxed and large @xmath24 can be allowed .",
    "we consider power - law cosmology with a brief period of recent cosmic era when dark energy began to dominate , i.e. from @xmath30 to present using results from wmap7 @xcite and wmap7+bao+@xmath2 combined datasets @xcite .",
    "there are tachyonic scalar field evolving under potential @xmath31 and dust barotropic fluid ( cold dark matter and baryonic matter ) as two major ingredients .",
    "we aim to test whether the power - law cosmology is still valid in the scenario of tachyonic scalar field by looking at value of the equation of state predicted by the power - law tachyonic cosmology and that of varying dark energy equation of state direct - observational result .",
    "the wmap7 and wmap7+bao+@xmath2 data used here are presented in table [ datatable ] .",
    "we also consider when the field is phantom , i.e. having negative kinetic term with phantom power - law expansion @xcite , @xmath32 from @xmath0 till present .",
    "we determine tachyonic field equation of state parameter , @xmath33 and we perform parametric plot versus exponent @xmath4 .",
    "we then analyze the result and conclude this work .",
    "we consider standard flrw universe containing dust matter ( cold dark matter and baryonic matter ) with tachyonic field with lagrangian , _ tachyon = -v ( ) evolving under the background friedmann equation , h^2 =  ( _ + _ m ) - and acceleration rate , [ hdot ] = - h^2 = -  ( _ c^2 + p _ + _ m c^2 + p_m ) + tachyonic field energy density and pressure are [ tphi ] _",

    "that is for both quintessence and tachyonic cases , @xmath33 does not depend on the scalar field model but depends on the form of expansion function .",
    "this is also true for @xmath40 .",
    "the equation of state is also independent of the sign of @xmath35 which indicates negative kinetic energy .",
    "using power - law expansion and phantom power - law expansion into ( [ wphi ] ) , one can find the present value of the equation of state , @xmath41 .",
    "this value is a ( phantom ) power - law prediction of the @xmath41 .",
    "we can compare this predicted value to the @xmath41 ( of varying equation of state ) obtained from cmb observation .    the derived data from wmap7+bao+@xmath2 and wmap7 are presented in table [ datatable ] .",
