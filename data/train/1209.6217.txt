    "the past decade has witnessed a great explosion of studying and understanding the underlying mechanisms of various real - life networks , ranging from the internet , scientific collaboration networks , protein networks to social networks , etc @xcite .",
    "although they respectively have their own properties and characteristics , empirical analyses show that many common characteristics and phenomena can be discovered from networks with such a wide - range functions , e.g. a small average distance between nodes , a large clustering coefficient @xcite , power - law degree distribution @xcite and community structures @xcite of the emerging structure .",
    "recently , studies on the mathematics of networks have been driven largely by those observed empirical properties of real networks , as well as network dynamics . however , many pioneering works in this area focus on designing evolutionary models of unipartite neworks which only have one kind of nodes , such as erds - rnyi network @xcite , watt - strogatz network @xcite , barabsi - albert network @xcite , as well as many extensive variants considering different factors ( e.g. aging effect @xcite and social impact @xcite ) .    recently , with the advent of web 2.0 and affiliated applications , the family of _ networks _ also has received many new members .",
    "one example is the bipartite network which involves two different kinds of nodes with different functions @xcite .",
    "different from traditional networks , the nodes in a pure bipartite network can be divided into two independent communities , where edges are only allowed to exist between different communities .",
    "nowadays , this bipartite network is widely applied in both online platforms ( e.g. online services where users view / purchase products @xcite , or listen to music @xcite ) , biology @xcite and medical science @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "there is also a vast class of researches that have recently reported many universal properties in unipartite networks , such as power - law degree distribution and correlation @xcite and community structure @xcite , could also be found in bipartite networks .",
    "consequently , it has attracted an increasing attention from scientific community due to its wide application and bright prospect in characterizing the essential properties of real networks .",
    "the first and natural attempt is to project the bipartite network to a corresponding unipartite network and using methods for traditional networks @xcite .",
    "however , it is argued that such one - mode projection ignores much informative structure and relationship , subsequently , it would give unreliable or incorrect results @xcite .",
    "therefore , a more common approach is to keep the original bipartite structure , investigate both its specific and common properties , and try to uncover the underlying mechanism driving the emergence of this two - mode network .",
    "_ used the random graph model to describe social networks of both unipartite and bipartite relations @xcite . using generating functions",
    "@xcite , they concluded that the clustering and average degree of real affiliation networks , as one typical kind of bipartite networks , agreed well with the theoretical prediction .",
    "proposed a personal identification and community imitation ( pici ) based model to consider both effects of collective behavior and personalization @xcite .",
    "this model generated an exponential and power - law degree distribution for music groups and owners , respectively .",
    "sood and redner introduced the voter model on networks of power - law degree distributions with and without degree correlation , both of which showed the consensus time was greatly dependent on the value of exponent @xcite .",
    "_ demonstrated that different mechanisms would generate different shape of degree distributions in group selection systems @xcite .",
    "that is to say , a random selection process would result in an exponential distribution of the activity degree , otherwise a power - law distribution of group size and activity degree would arise from the resultant force of preferential selection and fixed - probability creation .",
    "proposed a minimalistic model of directed bipartite network , and a self - organization phenomenon was observed by a dynamical reconnection process @xcite .",
    "similar result was also found in collaboration bipartite networks via preferential attachment of actors degree @xcite .",
    "hence , this model only reproduced that one kind of node followed power - law but neglecting outputs of the other side of nodes .",
    "_ introduced two mechanisms , specialization and interaction , would produce exponential degree distribution for both sides @xcite .",
    "in addition , they found this bipartite cooperation can well characterize the structure of both ecological and organization networks .    in this paper , we focus on studying the degree distribution of online bipartite networks where users view / choose / select objects ( e.g. bookmarks , music , movies ) , as well as the underlying mechanisms . despite many previous studies demonstrated that both exponential and power - law degree distribution could be obtained by corresponding models , empirical analysis of some online bipartite networks",
    "shows that the user degree distribution actually follows shifted power - law , so - called _ mandelbrot law _",
    "@xcite , instead of purely exponential or power - law decay , while the object degree distribution always obeys power - law @xcite , and it can not be fully explained by previous models .",
    "therefore , we propose an evolutionary model to consider the proactive selection activity of users and the passive pattern of objects .",
    "theoretical analysis shows that the present model can not only well reproduce the two different degree distribution , but also find good agreements of two real - world data sets , _",
    "_ delicious _ _ and _ _ citeulike__. in addition , we find that the structural parameter @xmath0 , determines the transformation from exponential to power - law decay of the user degree distribution .",
    "in this section , we shall propose an evolving model to uncover the growing dynamics of online bipartite networks . here , we mainly consider two mechanisms : random and preferential attachment .",
    "in particular , we assume there are two kind of online behaviors for users : she can either randomly choose an object or pick up an item according to its popularity .",
    "on one hand , considering a new user involving in the system , it would be difficult for her to select a suitable object from numerous candidates .",
    "one reasonable action she would take is to choose a popular item since other users also like it . on the other hand , old users who have devoted much time in playing the online platform ,",
    "would know to find their own favorites and thus are likely to select personalized ( hence might be less popular ) items .",
    "that is to say , users are very proactive in performing online activities . in @xcite , they reported such a hybrid behavior would result in an intermediate status between power - law and exponential distribution .",
    "by contrast , objects in online systems are always in a passive pattern , hence do not have any choice but waiting to be selected to gain popularity .",
    "therefore , we assume objects always grow based on preferential attachment in our model .",
    "we begin our study with some related definitions of bipartite graph that we will analyze .",
    "the bipartite graph can be represented by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are two disjoint sets of nodes , respectively representing users and objects , and @xmath4 is the set of edges .",
    "the difference with classical graph lies in the fact that edges exist only between user vertices and object vertices .",
    "the model starts from an initial bipartite network : there exist @xmath5 nodes in @xmath2 , @xmath6 nodes in @xmath3 and @xmath7 edges in set @xmath8 .",
    "given a user @xmath9 in @xmath2 and an object @xmath10 in @xmath3 , denote @xmath11 as the degree of @xmath9 and @xmath12 as the degree of @xmath10 in the bipartite network .",
    "then , @xmath13 . there are totally @xmath14 users and @xmath15 objects in the model at time @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , the model can be described as following :    * adding a new user : connect the new user node to @xmath17 different nodes already in @xmath3 by preferential probability @xmath18 . * adding a new object : link the new node to @xmath19 different nodes already in @xmath2 by preferential probability @xmath20 .",
    "* edges evolving randomly : two kinds of old nodes are connected by @xmath21 edges , which are chosen as : users are selected randomly with probability @xmath22 , while objects in @xmath3 are selected by preferential probability @xmath18 .",
    "* edges evolving by preferential attachment : two kinds of old nodes are connected by @xmath23 edges , which are chosen as : users are selected by preferential probability @xmath20 , and objects are also selected by preferential probability @xmath18 .",

    "from the aforementioned model description , we can write the dynamics of degree for object @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath15 , @xmath34 . then eq . [ eq : eq1 ] is approximated to @xmath35 where @xmath36=@xmath37 , @xmath38=@xmath39 , t@xmath40m , n , c , b and @xmath41 .",

    "[ eq : eq10 ] , we will get the cumulative probability @xmath67 so the user degree distribution function is finally achieved by assuming @xmath52 @xmath68 from eq .",
    "[ eq : eq12 ] , we know that the user degree distribution is a shifted power - law distribution @xcite , which is also familiar as mandelbort law @xcite .",
    "in this section , we use two data sets to evaluate the proposed model .",
    "the first one is _ delicious _ , one of the most popular social bookmarking web sites , which allows users not only to store and organize personal bookmarks , but also to look into users collection and find what they might be interested in @xcite . the other is from @xmath25 , which also has similar characterizations with @xmath24 .",
