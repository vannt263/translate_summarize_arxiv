    "as data on charm and beauty decays accumulates at cleo , bes , and the fermilab and lep experiments , and soon at the @xmath5 factories babar and belle , it becomes possible to study ever more rare decays in search of interesting and exotic physics .",
    "this work suggests examining a largely overlooked class , electromagnetic decays of a charged meson mediated by the weak annihilation of the meson .",
    "such decays are indeed rare , with branching ratios ( brs ) suppressed by @xmath6 , not to mention the difficulty of forcing a camel ( the whole meson wavefunction ) through the eye of a needle ( the pointlike @xmath1 vertex multiplied by ckm factors ) , but their brs need not be so tiny as one might think .",
    "let us focus upon processes with only one meson in the final state .",
    "such decays are especially interesting because they proceed through only one weak decay topology at leading order in @xmath0 if @xmath7 the flavors of all the valence quarks in both initial and final states are distinct , and @xmath8 the initial and final quark have the same electric charge ( and similarly for the antiquarks ) .",
    "this is the @xmath9-channel annihilation topology presented in fig .",
    "note that the first condition requires each valence quark to terminate on a flavor - changing vertex , while the second eliminates the possibility of a @xmath10-channel @xmath1 exchange .",
    "the photon may be attached to any charged line , although of course couplings to the lighter constituents are favored . at @xmath11 corrections",
    "enter through diagrams with a penguin loop on each of the quark and antiquark lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]@xmath12 ) , crossed - box diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]@xmath13 ) , and the diagram with the photon coupled to the @xmath1 , none of which is expected to be very large .",
    "in addition , one may go beyond the valence diagrams and describe the weak process including its short - distance qcd corrections in terms of operators mixed through evolution of the corresponding anomalous dimension matrix , but we do not perform this refinement in this work .",
    "the interest in such decays lies partly in the simplicity of the weak topology and sensitivity to a number of hard - to - isolate ckm elements ( as well as strong and electromagnetic matrix elements ) , and partly in the simplicity of the two - body final state .",
    "indeed , the hard , monochromatic final - state photon should prove an exceptionally unambiguous experimental signal for these decays .",
    "it should also be pointed out that these modes would represent the first electromagnetic decays observed for the charged @xmath14 mesons @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( except for the famous penguin mode @xmath18 ) , or @xmath19 .",
    "table  [ modes ] presents decays representing the 6 possible weak annihilation flavor assignments obeying our constraints , along with the ckm factors in the amplitude and their behavior in powers of the wolfenstein parameter @xmath20 .    to our knowledge , the cabibbo - unsuppressed mode @xmath21 was first studied in ref.@xcite via quark model , then through pole and vector meson dominance ( vmd ) calculations@xcite , light - cone@xcite , and effective field theory techniques@xcite .",
    "estimates for br @xmath22 vary from 2.1@xcite to 80@xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a summary ) . the present calculation , which for simplicity only takes into account one pole diagram in the language of refs .",
    "@xcite , gives @xmath23 .",
    "the double cabibbo - suppressed mode @xmath3 was also studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , with br results ranging from @xmath24@xmath25 ; we obtain @xmath26 .",
    "encouraged by this consistency with the more elaborate calculations , we apply our simple picture to the @xmath17 and @xmath19 modes . while @xmath2 is exciting because it might already appear in charm experiment data , @xmath3 is interesting because it exhibits a neturinoless decay sensitive to @xmath27 .    the modes @xmath28 and @xmath29 (",
    "collectively , @xmath30 ) , were suggested@xcite as probes of @xmath31 and were estimated to have brs of approximately @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . from table  [ modes ] we see that the @xmath17 decays suffer the worst ckm suppressions .",
    "a number of the theoretical uncertainties associated with these estimates can be eliminated if the on - shell photon is replaced by an @xmath34 pair@xcite , and the invariant mass @xmath35 of the virtual photon is used to define an operator product expansion .",
    "the price one pays for this improvement is an extra factor of @xmath6 , so that such decays are estimated to have brs of a few times @xmath36 or @xmath37 , depending upon the level of cabibbo suppression .",
    "the @xmath10-channel exchange processes mentioned above , which have neutral initial- and final - state mesons , are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and yield similar brs .",
    "most of these processes are too rare to be seen in appreciable numbers at the @xmath5 factories ( with combined yields of some millions of @xmath38 pairs per year@xcite ) , but may be observable at hadron collider experiments .",
    "the @xmath39 modes appear to have been studied only using the light - cone approach , in ref .",
    "we obtain br results several orders of magnitude larger than theirs , and comment on this discrepancy below .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ calc ] , we present a very simple - minded calculation of the rate for these processes and a list of approximations used , while sec .  [ concl ] presents numerical results , outlines experimental prospects for the observation of these modes , lists potential theoretical improvements , and concludes .",
    "the calculation presented in this section is very simplistic , in that it relies on a number of substantial approximations made explicit below .",
    "however , it is significant not in providing an exact determination of widths and brs , but in obtaining the order of magnitude of these quantities as an estimate for experimenters searching for signals of these modes , and as a point of comparison for theorists performing subsequent , more refined calculations .",
    "the generic process we consider is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the massive initial @xmath14 state , @xmath42 is a lighter virtual @xmath14 meson with the flavor quantum numbers of the final state , and @xmath43 is the final - state @xmath44 meson , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for the charm decays , we have commented that consistency with the more elaborate calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite indicates that this elementary ansatz seems to capture the essential order - of - magnitude physics .",
    "this approach avoids the danger of large cancellations between competing diagrams , but also runs the risk of missing important contributions in some cases . in modeling the decay this way",
    ", we make the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "photon emission from @xmath41 is neglected , so the process @xmath45 is not included , as was done in refs .",
    "indeed , the @xmath46 couplings have only measured upper bounds . in the charm case , refs .",
    "@xcite used @xmath46 input from previous theoretical calculations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , the @xmath51 and @xmath52 couplings were related through heavy quark spin - flavor symmetry ( hqs ) to that of @xmath53 , and both diagrams were included .",
    "however , in the current case with , for example , @xmath54 or @xmath55 , this is no longer an acceptable approximation , and we include only the photon coupling to the lighter mesons .",
    "this assumption likely leads to an underestimate of the br , but probably not an exceptionally large one : the @xmath56 and @xmath55 electromagnetic widths are @xmath57 and @xmath58 kev , respectively , while that of the @xmath59 is less than 4.2 kev ; ) or different a light quark charge in @xmath60 can enhance the importance of such couplings in the full width .",
    "] moreover , the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite show the @xmath46 amplitudes to be about 1/4 as large as those for @xmath52 .",
    "conversely , the light - cone calculations@xcite include only the photon coupling to @xmath41 , arguing that couplings to @xmath43 are suppressed by light quark masses .",
    "complete factorization with vacuum insertion approximation is assumed for the weak vertex .",
    "the annihilation of @xmath41 and the creation of @xmath42 are assumed to occur at a single point .",
    "this approximation neglects both the short - distance qcd corrections as mentioned above , and long - distance hadronic contributions . as an example of the latter , the initial weak vertex may , rather than annihilating the initial meson , produce a quark ( or antiquark ) @xmath61 that is the antiparticle of one of the meson valence quarks , and this four - quark intermediate state propagates for some time before @xmath62 annihilation occurs .",
    "specifically , processes like @xmath63 , which require an understanding of final - state interactions , are not included , nor are the significant vmd diagrams such as @xmath64 , where the @xmath65 couples resonantly to a photon ; nevertheless , the ckm coefficient of all these diagrams is the same .",
    "the intermediate state @xmath42 is assumed to be the lightest pseudoscalar with the same flavor quantum numbers as the final - state @xmath43 .",
    "certainly many other resonant as well as multiparticle states with total angular momentum @xmath66 ( that of @xmath41 ) can couple the weak vertex to @xmath67 ; however , the parity - violating couplings to @xmath68 states are neglected here .",
    "the present assumption is made partly because data exists on the @xmath52 coupling from the observed decay @xmath69 , and partly because the lightest pseudoscalar @xmath42 among all possible intermediates presumably has the one of the largest couplings to @xmath67 due to a relatively large wavefunction overlap . in any case",
    ", this approximation leads to an underestimate of the correct br .",
    "4 .   in comparing the virtual process @xmath70 to the on - shell @xmath69 , one relates the single ( magnetic ) form factor @xmath71 at a virtuality of @xmath72 to that at @xmath73 .",
    "we take them numerically equal , although this tends to overestimate the rate , since form factors tend to fall off away from @xmath73 .",
    "nevertheless , we indicate this ratio explicitly in the final expression , see eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) below .",
    "given these assumptions , the calculation of the rate is a simple matter .",
    "the weak mixing vertex , mediated by an operator @xmath74 , in vacuum insertion approximation is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is now abbreviated as @xmath41 , the valence structure of @xmath42 is @xmath77 , that of @xmath41 is @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are the ckm parameters associated with the annihilation of @xmath41 and creation of @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "we also allow for a coefficient @xmath5 parameterizing the incompleteness of the vacuum saturation approximation , as in @xmath80 mixing , but set it to unity in our numerical estimates .",
    "the intermediate @xmath14 state @xmath42 provides the simple propagator @xmath81 .",
    "the photon vertex is extracted from the decay @xmath82 , which has invariant amplitude @xmath83 where the lorentz coupling is determined in part by the @xmath14 quantum number of @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath84 is a magnetic form factor , and simply becomes a transition magnetic moment when its momentum transfer argument @xmath85 is set to zero in the on - shell case .",
    "the rate obtained from this amplitude is @xmath86 the full rate for @xmath87 also uses @xmath88 , but now has the argument @xmath89 . for our numerical estimates , we assume that @xmath84 does not change dramatically over this range , and use data on @xmath82 to eliminate @xmath84 from the expression for @xmath90 ; however , since this is certainly a contentious approximation , we formally retain the ratio of @xmath84 at the two different argument values in the full expression for the width . putting this together , one obtains our central result : @xmath91 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left ( \\frac{m^2}{m^2-m_p^2 } \\right)^2 \\left ( \\frac{m^2-m_v^2}{m_v^2 - m_p^2 } \\right)^3 \\left ( \\frac{m^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_v}{m } \\right)^3 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the cubed mass factors are nothing more than the ratio of @xmath92 for @xmath87 to that for @xmath69 .",
    "one may compare eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) to eq .",
    "( 17 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath93 , which in the current notation reads @xmath94 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left [ \\frac{m_v m ( m - m_v ) ( m+m_v)^3}{(m_{v^\\prime}^2 - m_{p^\\prime}^2)^3 } \\right ] \\left ( \\frac{m^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{v^\\prime}}{m } \\right)^3 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath95 pair @xmath96 are related to @xmath97 by hqs : the primed mesons are introduced when data for @xmath98 is unavailable . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath96 were @xmath99 and the experimental upper bounds for @xmath100 were used ; the current calculation uses only information from the unprimed mesons directly , so @xmath101 here .",
    "all of the differences between eqs .",
    "( [ rate ] ) and ( [ hqrate ] ) can be accounted for by the assumptions of hqs : first , the magnetic moment form factors for all heavy mesons were assumed the same , except for a trivial coefficient due to the electric charge @xmath102 of the lighter quark @xmath61 in the meson @xmath103 to which the photon couples . since both the @xmath104 and @xmath52 couplings",
    "were included in the hqs calculation , an extra enhancement of @xmath105 , a factor of 9 , appeared in ref  @xcite .",
    "next , in hqs one has @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , @xmath41 being the heavy quark mass .",
    "the remaining differences arise from the fact that fields containing heavy quarks in hqs are nearly static , even if the heavy quark changes flavor .",
    "this leads one to adopt the normalization of hqs states of 1 rather than @xmath108 particles per unit volume , as well as introduce propagators linear rather than quadratic in particle masses , and these modifications often lead to effective lowest - order substitutions ( in the current notation ) such as @xmath109 .",
    "equations  ( [ rate ] ) and ( [ hqrate ] ) are related by the application of these properties .",
    "we employ eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) to obtain br estimates for the 6 modes exhibited in table  [ modes ] .",
    "we use standard _ review of particle physics _",
    "( rpp)@xcite values for masses , decay constants , ckm elements , and lifetimes whenever possible , with the following exceptions : we take @xmath110 , @xmath111 mev , and @xmath112 mev . following recent experiments",
    ", we use the e791 value@xcite @xmath113 psec , and the cdf values@xcite @xmath114 gev , @xmath115 psec .",
    "opal@xcite and aleph@xcite have also reported a few @xmath39 candidate events , with mass values consistent with ref .",
    "we also use the most recent lattice determinations@xcite of @xmath116 , which combined give @xmath117 mev . as mentioned previously , we take @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the resulting brs are exhibited in table  [ res ] , along with the energies of the final - state photon .",
    "we see that the @xmath17 modes give brs in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , despite a very different calculation , and similarly for the @xmath120 decays in comparison with refs .",
    "@xcite , as promised in sec .  [ intro ] .",
    "a few @xmath3 and @xmath4 should appear each year at the @xmath5 factories , with the exact number depending upon the correct value of the mantissa in our estimate .",
    "the mode @xmath121 might even be observable right now at charm experiments such as at bes ( or possibly cleo ) if our estimate is low by a factor of a few , or the upper bounds of the estimates in refs .",
    "@xcite are correct , based on limits in the rpp@xcite ; in any case , existing experiments can place a meaningful upper limit on its br .    however , in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that the @xmath19 modes are rare but not exceptionally so ; they find br@xmath122 and br@xmath123",
    ". this @xmath124 discrepancy might be explainable if @xmath125 , but then the order - of - magnitude agreement for @xmath126 and @xmath5 decays becomes a mystery .",
    "furthermore , even if the form factor @xmath84 falls off this dramatically , other longer - distance mechanisms ( see point 2 in sec .",
    "[ calc ] ) would likely step in to maintain the rate .",
    "of course , since the @xmath5 factories are not designed to produce @xmath39 s , the possible observation of these modes must necessarily wait for the upcoming hadron collider experiments at the lhc or tevatron .",
    "although much physics is neglected in this simple calculation , our estimates show that weak annihilation decays may be observed in the near future .",
    "they are attractive from both the experimental and theoretical perspective .",
    "improvement of the theoretical calculation essentially amounts to improving on the four assumptions made in sec .",
    "lifting the first requires new data for the heavy coupling in @xmath127 , particulary positive data for @xmath128 . improving the vacuum insertion approximation",
    "can be accomplished as in @xmath80 mixing , with lattice or model calculations , and including the short - distance qcd corrections is a straightforward matter .",
    "many of the neglected long - distance corrections such as vmd diagrams have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , but one must take care with their relative phases , while final - state interactions must still be taken into account . as for the remaining two assumptions , one can be freed of both the lowest - resonance dominance and constant form factor assumptions by either including other intermediate channels explicitly , or carrying out light - cone or inclusive quark model calculations .    from the experimental side ,",
    "it would be interesting to see what direct bounds can be placed on these modes at the current time , in anticipation of their eventual observation .",
