    "gamma - ray bursts are distributed isotropically on the sky ; their peak flux distribution shows the lack of faint bursts compared to the expectation for a homogeneous distribution in euclidean space ( see e.g.  fishman & meegan 1995 for review ) .",
    "these observed properties of grb are reproduced by two popular models : 1 ) grb arise in an extended galactic halo with a core radius of @xmath6  kpc and 2 ) grb are located at cosmological distances .",
    "the galactic halo models are challenged by the observed isotropy of the burst positions .",
    "the isotropy constraints much improved recently , and as a result , most variants of the halo model are no longer viable ( briggs et al.1996 ) .",
    "an additional argument against the galactic halo model comes from _ einstein _ data .",
    "the _ einstein _",
    "ipc sensitivity is sufficient to detect bursts from the halos of nearby galaxies , but they were not found in the data ( hamilton et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in the cosmological model , the burst isotropy and departures of @xmath7 from the euclidean @xmath8 law are explained naturally .",
    "the minimum redshift @xmath9 of the optical transient associated with grb  970528 ( metzger  1997 ) is a decisive evidence in favor of the cosmological model .",
    "optical spectroscopy of the grb counterparts is complicated by the faintness of associated optical transients and their relatively featureless spectrum ( e.g. , no strong emission lines were observed in the grb  970528 optical transient ) .",
    "therefore , indirect estimates of the grb distance scale are still useful .",
    "the shape of the grb peak flux distribution implies that sources of the dimmest batse bursts are at @xmath10 , assuming no source evolution ( emslie & horack 1994 ; fishman & meegan 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "for some plausible evolution of grb volume density , the above distance estimate can vary by a factor of @xmath11 ( horack et al .",
    "1995 ) . using a different approach ,",
    "quashnock ( 1996 ) derived @xmath12 for the dimmest batse bursts by cross - correlating the third batse catalog with the known large scale structure at low redshifts .",
    "some earlier studies already searched for a direct relationship between grb and other astrophysical objects at cosmological distances .",
    "kolatt & piran ( 1996 ) and marani et al .  (",
    "1997 ) found that grb from the third batse catalog are correlated with abell clusters .",
    "however , using more precise grb localizations , burenin et al .  (",
    "1997 ) , hurley et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and gorosabel & castro - tirado ( 1997 ) have not found any correlation with abell clusters .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude of correlation of well - localized grb and @xmath13 abell clusters is lower than expected in the case of the same spatial distribution of grb and optically luminous matter ( burenin et al .",
    "if this result is interpreted as an indication that bright and well - localized grb are at greater distances than nearby abell clusters , the dimmest batse bursts should be at @xmath14 , in agreement with quashnock s ( 1996 ) results .    at",
    "still higher redshifts , @xmath15 , a natural choice is to search for correlation of grb with quasars and other flavors of active galactic nuclei , which comprise the majority of known objects at these high redshifts . to search for correlation of agn and grb",
    "is also attractive because some theoretical models relate bursts to physical processes in active nuclei ( e.g.  lejter 1980 , carter 1992 ) .",
    "some attempts to search for such a correlation have been undertaken earlier . a marginal evidence for excess of qso in the small interplanetary network ( ipn ) grb error boxes has been found ( vrba  1995 ) .",
    "however , webber  ( 1995 ) and gorosabel  ( 1995 ) found that the number of qso and agn in grb error boxes is consistent with random .",
    "these earlier analyses were based on a smaller number of bursts with good localizations than available at present . citing a recent work , schartel  ( 1997 )",
    "have found a correlation of well - localized grb from the third batse catalog with radio - quiet qso .",
    "the strongest correlation was detected at the @xmath16 confidence level for intrinsically bright qso with @xmath17 .",
    "the goal of this work is to search for a correlation of grb with qso and agn using all available data for good , with @xmath18 uncertainty , bursts localizations .",

    "thirteen more localizations were found in the literature cited by lund ( 1995 ) .",
    "all these sources provide 99% confidence burst position regions . in total",
    ", the first set contains 98 bursts .",
    "the second and third data sets are based on batse data .",
    "we use only bursts with batse error circle @xmath22 at 68% confidence .",
    "the second data set includes 117 such bursts from the third batse catalog ( meegan  1996 ) , excluding those grb which are already in the first set .",
    "the third data set includes 112 bursts from the current batse catalog , excluding bursts already in the first or second sets .",
    "the current catalog was download on october 13 , 1997 from http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/.    peak fluxes of the grb in use are in the range @xmath23  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath4 in the 100500 kev energy band ; the peak fluxes , and hence the burst distance distributions , are approximately the same in all three datasets .",
    "we used qso and agn from vron - cetti & vron ( 1996 ; vcv96 hereafter ) `` catalogue of quasars and active nuclei '' compiled from the literature .",
    "this catalog contains 8609 qso , 220 bl lac objects , and 2833 agn .",
    "the catalog completeness varies with the object class and redshift which makes a secondary selection warranted .",
    "since we have only 327 grb , it is meaningless to correlate their positions with objects from a catalog with completeness @xmath24 .",
    "we attempted to define subsamples of vcv96 catalog which are complete at the level sufficient to search for angular correlation of objects and grb .",

    "the distribution predicted for the pure luminosity evolution model of franceschini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) is also shown .",
    "it is clear that vcv96 catalog of qso is almost complete at @xmath13 ; it is less than @xmath25 complete at @xmath26 and it is meaningless to search for correlation of our grb and qso at this redshift .",
    "similarly , we find that the catalog becomes essentially incomplete for bl lac objects at @xmath27 and for agn already at @xmath28 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "as was discussed in  1 , sources of bright bursts are probably located at higher redshifts , @xmath29@xmath30 , therefore the search for correlation of grb and all agn from vcv96 can be inconclusive .",

    "the solid line in fig .",
    "2 shows the redshift distribution @xmath0 agn .",
    "we also show the number densities expected from agn luminosity functions in hamburg / eso ( he s , khler  1997 ) and the large bright quasar ( lbqs , hewett  1993 ) surveys .",
    "it is clear from fig .  2 that vcv96 catalog is reasonably complete for @xmath0 agn out to @xmath31 .",
    "we will search for correlation of grb with these luminous agn .",
    "a naive method to search for correlation of objects and grb would be to count the number of objects inside the grb position error boxes and compare this number with that expected for random burst / object locations .",
    "however , the spatial distribution of agn and qso from the vcv96 catalog is very non - uniform , because many objects were found in deep , small area surveys . in this case",
    ", it is better to use a statistics , which we denote @xmath32 , of the number of bursts whose position error regions contain at least one agn or qso .",
    "the distribution of @xmath32 expected for purely chance associations can be derived by monte - carlo simulations in which the actual agn and qso catalog is cross - correlated with mock catalogs of randomly located grb .",
    "the mock grb catalogs were simulated with the same position error boxes as in the data , but with centroid positions distributed randomly . in simulating grb positions , we accounted for the sky exposure for watch / granat and batse bursts , and assumed a uniform coverage for other experiments .",
    "we have found that the distribution of @xmath32 derived from simulations is accurately approximated by the binomial distribution with the number of trials , @xmath33 , equal to the number of bursts , and success probability @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the average value derived from simulations .",

    "in search for angular correlation , it is reasonable to restrict the agn redshift range since there are indications that the grb luminosity function must be narrow , @xmath40 ( emslie & horack 1994 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the flux range of our bursts corresponds to the distance range of a factor of @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity can be enhanced by considering only agn with @xmath42 and varying @xmath43 .",
    "the sensitivity may be enhanced still further if the lower boundary is a larger fraction of @xmath43 , because the vcv96 catalog completeness falls rapidly with redshift , while most of the volume ( and presumably , most of the grb sources ) is near the upper boundary of the redshift interval .",
    "therefore , we use the redshift range @xmath44 . in doing so ,",
    "we retain approximately 97% of the volume of the original @xmath45 interval and in the same time significantly improve the sensitivity .",
    "as a first step , we performed the correlation analysis for qso , bl lac objects , and bright agn without any redshift constraints .",
    "the results are presented in table  1 , where we list the observed values of @xmath32 ( recall that @xmath32 is the number of bursts with at least one cataloged object inside the error box ) , the average values @xmath35 expected for purely chance associations of bursts and objects , and the probability to find a larger value of @xmath32 than observed . in neither case , a significant ( at at least 99% confidence ) correlation is found .",
    "next , we performed the correlation analysis with the redshift constraints as described in  3 above .",
    "in particular , we considered qso or agn in the redshift interval @xmath44 , and determined the values @xmath36 , @xmath35 , and @xmath46 as a function of limiting redshift @xmath43 .",
    "results for the first grb dataset are shown in fig .  3 for both qso and agn .",
    "while qso show a slight excess of @xmath32 over random expectations , this excess is @xmath47 significant at almost all @xmath43 .",
    "agn , on the contrary , show a profound peak of correlation for @xmath48 , i.e.  in the redshift interval @xmath49 .",
    "the excess of the observed value of @xmath32 over @xmath35 is significant at the 99.8% confidence .    the results for 117 bursts from the second grb dataset ( the third batse catalog ) , 112 bursts from the third grb dataset ( the current batse catalog ) , and all three datasets combined ( 327 bursts in total ) are shown in figs .  4 , 5 , and 6 , respectively .",
    "the peak of the grb - agn correlation amplitude at @xmath50 found in the first dataset , is present in two other datasets . when all three grb datasets are combined ( fig .",
    "6 ) , the statistical significance of this correlation is very high , @xmath51 .",
    "of course , the agn redshift range was optimized , therefore the actual significance is somewhat lower .",
    "the number of independent redshift intervals in our analysis can be estimated as the ratio of the log width of the searched redshift range @xmath52 and the log width of individual intervals @xmath53 . allowing for the partial overlap",
    ", we find @xmath54 independent redshift `` trials '' , and hence the actual significance of the correlation is @xmath55 .",
    "gamma - ray bursts from the second dataset show some correlation with qso with a @xmath56 significance ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "it is this correlation that was found by schartel  ( 1997 ) .",
    "however , this correlation is absent in two other datasets ( fig .  3 and fig .  5 ) ; hence , the grb - qso correlation in fig .  4 probably can be explained by a random deviation .",
    "we conclude that the most prominent correlation of gamma - ray bursts with extragalactic objects found so far is that with the active galactic nuclei in the redshift range @xmath57 .",
    "this correlation suggests that at least some bursts may be physically related to agn .",
    "next , we want to determine the fraction of bursts related to agn in the redshift interval @xmath1 .",
    "since not all agn in this interval are cataloged , we first estimated the fraction of bursts which may be related to agn _ from the vcv96 catalog_. to derive the fraction of bursts which may be related to _ both cataloged and not cataloged",

    "given @xmath58 , the number of physically connected bursts , @xmath59 , was drawn from the binomial distribution with success probability @xmath58 and the number of trials equal to the number of bursts .",
    "we then randomly picked @xmath59 agn and @xmath59 bursts from the data , and set burst error region centroids at the chosen agn .",
    "the positions for the rest of grb were chosen randomly , as in  3 .",
    "we then found the value of @xmath32 for such a mock burst catalog . repeating these simulations",
    ", we derived the probability distribution @xmath60 as a function of @xmath58 . using the derived @xmath61 we estimated the best - fit @xmath58 as a value which maximized the probability to obtain the observed value @xmath36 , i.e.which miminized @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 is equivalent to the c - statistics of cash ( 1979 ) , and so the confidence intervals of @xmath58 can be derived from the change in @xmath63 .",
    "this analysis was performed separately for batse ( second+third datasets ) and non - batse ( first dataset ) burst data . in the case of batse data with 68% position error circles ,",
    "the derived value @xmath58 has been corrected by a factor of 1.47 . for both batse and non - batse data",
    ", we obtained consistent fractions , of order of several percent , of bursts originating in the cataloged agn .",
    "for the first dataset , @xmath64 ( 68% ) and @xmath65 ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "for the bursts detected by batse ( second and third data sets together ) : @xmath66 ( 68% ) and @xmath67 ( 95% ) .",
    "next , we have to correct @xmath58 for the incompleteness of the vcv96 catalog .",
    "if one assumes that at @xmath68 , all @xmath0 agn are cataloged , the completeness in the @xmath1 interval is low , @xmath69 .",
    "if , instead , the he s survey luminosity function is used , the completeness is @xmath70 .",
    "both these values are smaller than the estimated @xmath58 , which means , formally , that more than 100% of bursts originate in agn .",
    "clearly , this is unphysical , and we discuss some possible explanations below .",
    "nevertheless , similar values of @xmath58 and catalog completeness suggest that a very significant fraction of grb is related to agn .",
    "below we discuss this result in connection with previous attempts to identify optical counterparts of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "this is not the first attempt to find optical counterparts of grb by analyzing the optical content of small - area localizations , so the comparison of our results with some previous works is in order .",
    "vrba et al .  (",
    "1995 ) have performed extensive optical photometry of 8 small - area ( @xmath71  arcmin@xmath72 ) ipn localizations searching for objects with unusual colors , variability , and proper motions",
    ". only blue objects , which vrba et al .  interpreted as qso , showed a marginal excess at a rate approximately one per localization .",
    "this is in agreement with our results .",
    "webber et al .  ( 1995 ) and gorosabel et al .  ( 1995 ) used several tens grb localizations from ipn and watch , respectively .",
    "the optical content was taken from existing catalogs , similar to our study .",
    "no excess of either agn or any other class of objects was found .",
    "these results do not directly contradict to ours because webber et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and gorosabel et al.(1995 ) used a smaller number of bursts , did not account for the incompleteness of optical catalogs (  2.2 ) , and did not apply redshift constraints in search for correlation .",
    "since the completeness of the vcv96 catalog ( and probably other all - sky catalogs ) is below , or on the level of , several percent (  4 ) , analyses based on several tens of bursts are inconclusive .",
    "the most similar to ours is the work of schartel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who cross - correlated batse bursts with the agn and qso from vcv96 .",
    "they found a marginal correlation with qso , and no correlation with agn , with no redshift constraints applied to agn .",
    "we essentially reproduce these results ( fig .  4 and table  1 ) .",
    "a significant correlation with agn found in our analysis is not found by schartel et al .  because they used a smaller number of bursts , with poorer localizations ( only batse data ) , and used the entire vcv96 catalog which is very incomplete for agn even at low redshift (  2.2 ) .    finally , we mention the two grb with small - area localizations , in which agn were found .",
    "drinkwater et al .",
    "( 1997 ) report that the possible x - ray counterpart of grb  920501 is associated with a seyfert  1 galaxy at @xmath73 .",
    "the first x - ray localization of a gamma - ray burst by bepposax ( 3@xmath74 radius ) contains a @xmath75 qso ( piro et al .",
    "on the other hand , optical transients associated with other bepposax bursts , grb  970508 , 970228 , and 971214 probably are not agn .",
    "our analysis supersedes most of earlier searches for grb - agn association because we used a large grb dataset , carefully accounted for incompleteness of the optical catalogs , and introduced sensible object redshift constraints .",
    "these advantages made it possible to find the strongest ever evidence for association of grb with a known class of extragalactic objects .",
    "however , there are several problems with our analysis .",
    "first , we used relatively large area gamma - ray burst localizations , and therefore had to perform a statistical correlation rather than an object - by - object identification .",
    "second , we used a sparse catalog of agn and qso , in which many objects were found in a number of small - area high - sensitivity searches .",
    "in fact , this introduces a possibility that the correlation we detect is not with agn but rather with objects around which the agn we searched , e.g.normal galaxies or other qso ( data from arp 1980 and monk et al .  1988 ) , targets of _ einstein _ pointings ( emss agn , stocke et al .",
    "however , the sky distribution of grb with @xmath1 agn inside the localization area , does not generally follow the regions of deep agn surveys ( fig .",
    "also , a clear redshift dependence of the correlation is not easily explainable in such a scenario .",
    "another problem is that the amplitude of the detected correlation implies that the fraction of bursts related to agn is somewhat higher than the estimated completeness of the optical catalog (  4 ) .",
    "we can offer two possible explanations .",
    "first is that grb prefer luminous agn , for which the catalog completeness is higher .",
    "second is that grb prefer a certain type of agn ( seyfert 1 or 2 , x - ray loud or quiet , radio loud or quiet , etc . ) which is more commonly present in the vcv96 catalog than the `` average '' agn .    despite these problems ,",
    "we believe that the case for an association of bright gamma - ray bursts with agn at moderate redshift is compelling",
    ". this case can be further proved , or disproved , by an extensive optical , preferably spectroscopic , survey of small - area localizations of bright grb , similar to the work of vrba et al .",
    "( 1995 ) but using a larger number of bursts .",
    "another approach would be to use a more complete catalog of agn covering a significant fraction of the sky ; unfortunately , this seems impractical until the sloan digitized sky survey is completed .",
