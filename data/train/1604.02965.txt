    "a classical nova is a thermonuclear runaway ( unstable hydrogen shell flash ) event on a mass - accreting white dwarf ( wd ) , which occurs if the mass accretion rate @xmath1 is smaller than the stability limit @xmath0 corresponding to the wd mass .",
    "many theoretical works on hydrogen shell flashes have been published . in general , shorter decay times of novae are obtained for more massive wds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "if the mass accretion rate exceeds @xmath0 , nuclear burning is stable and no repeating shell flashes occur . this stability has long been studied in analytical and numerical works @xcite .",
    "the physical reason of stabilization was also presented by many authors @xcite .",
    "the border between the stable and unstable mass accretion rates is known as the stability line , i.e. , @xmath0 , in the diagram of accretion rate versus wd mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there is another critical accretion rate , above which the optically thick winds occur @xcite .",
    "a hydrogen - rich envelope of a wd blows optically thick winds @xcite , instead of slowly expanding to a red - giant size @xcite .",
    "this critical mass accretion rate is dubbed as @xmath2 , which is about twice @xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in summary , when the mass accretion rate @xmath1 is less than the stability line , @xmath3 , the nuclear burning is unstable and the wd undergoes a number of nova outbursts .",
    "if the mass accretion rate is between the two critical values , i.e. , @xmath4 , the hydrogen shell burning is stable ( see figure [ precwdmass ] ) .",
    "the accreted hydrogen - rich matter burns steadily on the wd at the same rate as the mass accretion rate .",
    "we suppose a binary configuration as illustrated in figure [ steadyaccretion ] ; that is , the wd accretes matter from an accretion disk .",
    "such a configuration has been used to explain supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the mass accretion rate is larger than @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath5 , optically thick winds blow from the surface of the envelope , and , at the same time , the wd accretes matter from the disk ( see figure [ accretionwind ] ) .",
    "hydrogen burning is stable and the accreted matter is partly burned into helium and accumulated onto the wd .",
    "the excess matter is lost by winds , with the mass - loss rate of @xmath6 .",
    "such a state was dubbed `` accretion wind evolution '' @xcite and has been regarded as the state of luminous ssss ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most recent versions of the stability line and critical line for winds appeared in figure 5 of @xcite .    to understand the nova cycle based on the above picture , we plot variations of envelope mass during one cycle of nova outburst in figure [ dmdtdm ] , a model of steady - state envelope solutions on a @xmath7 wd @xcite .",
    "when the envelope mass reaches a critical value , hydrogen ignites to trigger a nova outburst ( denoted by the upward arrow ) .",
    "the envelope expands to reach optical maximum ( point c ) .",
    "the optically thick winds are accelerated so that the envelope mass decreases by wind mass loss ( @xmath8 ) and hydrogen burning ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the envelope evolves down along with the black line with the photospheric temperature increasing . when the photospheric temperature reaches the opal opacity s peak ( @xmath10 ( k ) @xmath11 ) , the optically thick winds cease ( point b ) .",
    "we define this point as @xmath12(b ) , @xmath13(b ) , and @xmath8(b)@xmath14 , above which we have optically thick wind solutions .",
    "after that , the envelope mass still decreases because of nuclear burning .",
    "when it reaches point a , hydrogen nuclear burning diminishes and the wd cools down .",
    "there exist equilibrium hydrogen - burning envelope solutions below point a but they are unstable ( see figure 1 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we define this envelope mass as @xmath15(a ) and @xmath16(a ) .",
    "if the ignition mass is smaller than that at point b in figure [ dmdtdm ] , i.e. , @xmath17(b ) , the nova reaches a point on the sequence between points a and b where no optically thick winds are accelerated .",
    "the envelope expands only slightly and the effective temperature does not decrease much , so it would be bright in the supersoft x - ray or uv band .",
    "it should be addressed that , if the accretion rate is high enough to be close to @xmath0 , the accretion to the wd during hydrogen shell burning makes the effective decreasing rate of the envelope mass smaller and , as a result , the nova - on ( sss ) phase becomes significantly longer .",
    "point a for various wd masses describe the stability line @xmath0 in figure [ precwdmass ] while point b for each wd mass corresponds to the line of the critical mass accretion rate @xmath2 for winds .",
    "if the mass - accretion rate @xmath1 is between @xmath0 and @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath18 , the hydrogen - rich envelope stays somewhere between a and b in figure [ dmdtdm ] and keeps a steady - state of @xmath19 without wind mass - loss ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "when the mass - accretion rate is larger than @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath21 , the envelope stays somewhere between b and c ( or above c ) in figure [ dmdtdm ] and keeps a steady - state of @xmath22(b ) .",
    "these basic properties of mass - accreting wds play essential roles in the evolution of binaries toward type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) . if the mass of a mass - accreting carbon - oxygen wd approaches the chandrasekhar mass , carbon ignites to trigger an sn ia explosion @xcite .",
    "the modern single degenerate ( sd ) scenario is based on the binary evolution theory in which both steady hydrogen shell burning ( figure [ steadyaccretion ] ) and accretion wind evolution ( figure [ accretionwind ] ) phases are taken into account in the evolutional paths to sne ia ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite elucidated the reason why they did not have steady hydrogen shell burning .",
    "kato et al . showed two different evolutions of mass accretion .",
    "they started the mass accretion onto a wd ( with no hydrogen burning ) at a rate higher than the stability line and obtain a first shell flash .",
    "they stopped the mass accretion during the mass - loss phase .",
    "after some time elapsed ( but with hydrogen shell burning still occurring ) , they restarted the mass accretion and obtained continuous shell burning ( steady - state burning ) .",
    "however , they obtained repeated shell flashes if they did not start the mass accretion until hydrogen shell burning began to decay .",
    "these flashes are obtained only when they controlled the on / off epochs of mass accretion .",
    "thus , one can obtain shell flashes above the stability line if one can control the on / off epochs of mass accretion .",
    "after kato et al.s ( 2014 ) paper was published , @xcite further claimed that they did not find steady burning simply because their numerical code produced a series of shell flashes .",
    "based on their time - dependent calculations , @xcite concluded that steady hydrogen shell burning , on which hachisu & kato s accretion wind evolution model depends , does not occur even above the stability line .",
    "motivated by such confusion , we study shell flashes above the stability line in a more systematic way . here",
    "we call them `` forced novae '' after forced oscillation in physics .",
    "the forced novae occur only if we control the on / off epochs of mass accretion .",
    "in contrast , shell flashes naturally occur _ below the stability line _ , so we call them `` natural novae . ''",
    "forced novae may occur if the mass accretion is controlled by some mechanism in the binary system . for example , if the accretion disk is destroyed or if the mass transfer from the companion stops , the wd has some period without mass accretion until the accretion condition is recovered . for classical novae , which are considered to be systems below the stability line , this situation has already been discussed as `` hibernation '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "forced novae could have much shorter recurrence periods than those of natural novae .",
    "we obtain the shortest recurrence period of forced novae and compare them with the recurrence period of natural novae .",
    "these recurrence periods give an important constraint on the wd masses of recurrent novae .",
    "for example , for the galactic recurrent nova u  sco , whose recurrence period is @xmath2312  yr , the wd mass is constrained to be @xmath24 from the recurrence periods of natural novae ( see figure 6 of * ? ? ? * ) . in the same way",
    ", the minimum periods of forced novae can be used to constrain the wd mass .",
    "using this constraint , we discuss the wd mass in t pyx .",
    "we organize the present paper as follows . in section [ section_time_depend ]",
    "we describe various forced nova evolutions using a time - dependent evolution code and in section [ sec_pmin ] we obtain the shortest recurrence periods of forced novae .",
    "we apply our results to various recurrent novae in section [ sec_discussion ] and constrain the wd mass of t  pyx by the shortest recurrence periods of forced novae .",
    "finally we summarize our results in section [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "in principle , no nova outbursts occur above the stability line , i.e. , @xmath25 , in figure [ precwdmass ] because nuclear burning is stable . however , there are two exceptions .",
    "one is the `` first shell flash '' ( the first nova outburst ) that occurs only once on the wd after it begins mass accretion .",
    "suppose that a naked wd begins accretion .",
    "hydrogen - rich matter accumulates on the wd .",
    "when it reaches the ignition mass , a hydrogen shell flash inevitably occurs .",
    "this is the first shell flash .",
    "if the mass accretion stays high as @xmath25 , hydrogen shell burning becomes stable and never stops ; i.e. , the wd keeps bright .",
    "thus , the first shell flash is the first and the last nova outburst for the wd .",
    "it never repeats nova outbursts .",
    "then the binary configuration is either that in figure [ steadyaccretion ] or that in figure [ accretionwind ] .",
    "the light curve for such a case has already been reported , e.g. , in figure 7(a ) of @xcite .",
    "the other case is a forced nova .",
    "if we stop mass accretion at some epoch during shell flashes , the wd can not keep steady hydrogen burning because of the shortage of nuclear fuel . the hydrogen shell burning eventually stops .",
    "then , we resume mass accretion and have the next outburst . in this manner , we have successive nova outbursts by manipulating mass accretion on and off .",
    "the quiescent phase is determined by the epoch when we switch mass accretion on . in this way",
    ", we can freely design a nova outburst for an accretion rate above the stability line , that is , @xmath25 , in figure [ precwdmass ] .",
    "this is the forced nova .",
    "evolution models of mass - accreting wds were calculated by using the same henyey - type code as in @xcite .",
    "this code implements zoning based on the fractional mass ( @xmath26 ) in outer layers of the hydrogen - rich envelope , whereas zoning is based on @xmath27 in the rest of the interior including nuclear burning layers . in the outer layers",
    "the gravitational energy release per unit mass , @xmath28 , is calculated as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total mass of the wd , @xmath27 is the mass within the radius @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the temperature and specific entropy , respectively .",
    "this zoning scheme with an off - center differencing for the equation of energy conservation @xcite works well for rapid evolution with mass accretion or decretion .",
    "accretion energy outside the photosphere is not included .",
    "the chemical composition of the accreting matter and initial hydrogen - rich envelope is assumed to be @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . neither convective overshooting nor diffusion processes of nuclei are included ; thus , no wd material is mixed into the hydrogen - rich envelope . because neutrino loss and electron conduction contribute very little to the total energy loss in the following calculations",
    ", we can approximate total energy conservation by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the photospheric luminosity , @xmath38 is the total gravitational energy release rate calculated by using @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the total nuclear energy release rate calculated by using@xmath41 with @xmath42 the nuclear burning rate per unit mass .    for the initial wd model",
    ", we adopted an equilibrium model ( i.e. ,  the steady - state models  of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which an energy balance is already established between heating by mass accretion and nuclear energy generation and cooling by radiative transfer and neutrino energy loss .",
    "this is a good approximation of the long time - averaged evolution of a mass accreting wd and we do not need to calculate many ( thousands ) cycles of shell flashes to relax thermal imbalance in the initial condition when we start from a cold wd . starting from such an initial equilibrium state ,",
    "the nova cycle approaches a limit cycle only after a few to several cycles ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for more detail ) .",
    "we first check our numerical code by calculating shell flashes with the same parameters as those in idan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , i.e. , the same wd mass ( @xmath43 ) and mass accretion rate ( @xmath44  yr@xmath45 ) , and a very similar manipulation of mass accretion ( on and off ) .",
    "this accretion rate is above the stability line .",
    "we plot the last five cycles of our forced nova calculation in figure [ l.m10.1e-6.two](s1)(s3 ) .",
    "the accretion phase is indicated by the short horizontal blue lines labeled `` acc '' in figure [ l.m10.1e-6.two](s1 ) .",
    "the recurrence period is 9.2 yr . no mass ejection occurs . to compare with idan et al.s figure 1 , we see that our photospheric luminosity , @xmath37 , in figure [ l.m10.1e-6.two](s1 ) , recurrence period , and no mass ejection well reproduced idan et al.s results . thus , we confirm that idan et al.s calculation describes a forced nova .",
    "enlarging figure [ l.m10.1e-6.two](s1 , s2 ) would reveals a very subtle kink in @xmath37 and @xmath40 at the point of restarting accretion at @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "this would probably correspond to small wiggles around @xmath48 in figure 1 of @xcite , although the authors did not mention the cause of them .",
    "this further supports the fact that our manipulation of accretion to be similar to them .",
    "figure [ l.m10.1e-6.two](s2 ) shows the nuclear luminosity , @xmath40 , and gravitational energy release , @xmath38 , for the same model as in figure [ l.m10.1e-6.two](s1 ) . in the very early phase of the nova outbursts , nuclear burning produces a large flux , but most of this is absorbed into the bottom region of the hydrogen - rich envelope and the photospheric luminosity does not exceed the eddington limit ,",
    "so @xmath37 has a flat peak .",
    "the burning zone slightly expands to absorb the nuclear energy flux , which appears in the negative values of @xmath38 , although such negative values of @xmath38 are cut off by the lower bound of the figure .",
    "the absorbed energy is gradually released in the later phase ( positive values of @xmath38 ) .",
    "this energy release is a main source for the photospheric luminosity @xmath49 in the interpulse ( quiescent ) phase .",
    "thus , the wd is still bright ( @xmath50 ) in the interpulse phase .",
    "one of the important features of this forced nova is that the hydrogen - rich envelope does not expand so much .",
    "thus , the photospheric temperature does not decrease to < 300,000 k. figure [ l.m10.1e-6.two](s3 ) shows the photospheric temperature , @xmath51 , supersoft x - ray ( 0.21 kev ) flux , and uv band ( 11202640  ) flux corresponding to the _ swift _ @xmath52 band .",
    "these luminosities are calculated by using a blackbody assumption from the photospheric temperature , @xmath51 , and luminosity , @xmath37 .",
    "they are very faint in the optical band , unlike classical novae .",
    "thus , such objects are recognized , if they exist , as intermittent supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) .",
    "however , an anticorrelation between optical ( high state ) and supersoft x - ray ( off state ) in the intermittent ssss , rx  j0513.9@xmath536951 and v  sge ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can not be explained by these forced novae .",
    "another important feature is the very high duty cycle ( nuclear burning on @xmath54 cycle duration @xmath55 ) , i.e. , 6.4 yr ( on ) + 2.8 yr ( off ) @xmath56 9.2 yr ( cycle duration ) .",
    "such a high duty cycle is not consistent with those of recurrent novae as discussed in more detail in section [ sec_discussion ] .    in connection",
    "to figure [ dmdtdm ] , idan et al.s forced nova has a smaller ignition mass than the critical envelope mass , i.e. , @xmath57(b ) .",
    "after the onset of a shell flash , it reaches somewhere between a and b and moves leftward .",
    "this is consistent with the result that the nova has no wind mass - loss .",
    "when it reaches point a , nuclear burning extinguishes .",
    "the wd becomes dark and moves downward .",
    "recently , @xcite also claimed that they did not obtain steady hydrogen burning .",
    "however , the light curves shown in figures 1 and 5 of hillman et al .",
    "indicate those are force nova models . in these light curves",
    "there are small jumps in luminosity around @xmath48 , which are signatures of re - starting matter accretion as seen in our figure [ l.m10.1e-6.two](l1 ) .",
    "that is , they seems to re - start accretion too late to obtain steady burning .",
    "figure [ l.m10.stburn ] shows an example of our calculation of the first shell flash on a @xmath7 wd with a mass accretion rate of @xmath58  yr@xmath45 , which is located in the middle of the steady hydrogen - burning zone in figure [ precwdmass ] ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this first shell flash occurs 20 yr after the start of mass accretion .",
    "the accreted matter is @xmath59 , which exceeds the critical envelope mass for wind mass loss , i.e. , @xmath60(b ) , in figure [ dmdtdm ] .",
    "so , we have mass loss during a short period ( denoted by the orange line labeled `` ml '' ) .",
    "another example is an accreting 1.35 @xmath61 wd with @xmath62  yr@xmath45 , as shown in figure [ l.m135.stburn ] ( the same model as in figure 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "it has a first shell flash 0.5 yr after the onset of accretion and maintains steady burning .    in this way",
    ", the first shell flash always occurs if we start the mass accretion onto a naked wd for any accretion rate above the stability line .",
    "of course , this does not mean that the hydrogen shell burning is unstable .",
    "we note that starrfield et al.s ( 2012 ) claim of the absence of steady burning seems to be misguided from their calculations up to the first flash ; they did nt continue the calculation after the first flash .    in the models of figures [ l.m10.stburn ] and [ l.m135.stburn ] , we resume mass accretion just after the wind mass loss stops , i.e. , before the hydrogen burning extinguishes ( before it reaches point a in figure [ dmdtdm ] ) .",
    "hydrogen shell burning continues .",
    "the accreted matter burns steadily at the same rate as the mass accretion .",
    "the luminosity is constant with time in a balance of @xmath63 , and the envelope mass is also constant with time .",
    "hydrogen shell burning is stable and never stops as long as we maintain the mass accretion as indicated by the horizontal blue lines in figures [ l.m10.stburn](a ) and [ l.m135.stburn](a ) .",
    "a helium layer develops underneath the hydrogen burning shell .",
    "a helium shell flash occurs when the mass of the helium layer becomes large enough .",
    "we suppose that these binaries are in the steady state described in figure [ steadyaccretion ] .",
    "the photospheric temperature of a wd is high enough to emit supersoft x - rays .",
    "such an object could be recognized as a persistent luminous supersoft x - ray source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the on / off epochs of mass accretion can be designed to control the recurrence period even for the same mass accretion rate and wd mass . if we continue mass accretion during the bright @xmath37 phase of the first shell flash , we obtain continuous hydrogen shell burning , which never stops as long as we continue mass accretion ( until a helium shell flash occurs ) . however ,",
    "if we stop at the beginning of a flash and resume mass accretion after hydrogen burning extinguishes , we obtain successive shell flashes . in this case , a later on time of mass accretion results in a longer recurrence period .",
    "figures [ l.m10.1e-6.two](l1)(l3 ) demonstrate an example of designed mass accretion . for the same wd mass and mass accretion rate as those of figures [ l.m10.1e-6.two](s1)(s3 ) , we can get a longer recurrence period of 23.7 yr by omitting mass accretion for 7 yr . the outburst amplitude is larger than in the case of figure [ l.m10.1e-6.two](s1 ) because of the cooling during the longer interpulse phase ( compare figure [ l.m10.1e-6.two](s2 ) with figure [ l.m10.1e-6.two](l2 ) ) . since the ignition mass in figure [ l.m10.1e-6.two](l1 ) is larger than that in figure [ l.m10.1e-6.two](s1 ) ,",

    ", we estimate a lower limit of the wd mass to be @xmath82 for @xmath83  yr , taking into account the possibility of it being a forced nova . note that wds close to this lower limit mass exhibit a high duty cycle , which is inconsistent with the observed low duty cycle of t  pyx ( @xmath84  days@xmath85  yr ) .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the wd mass of t  pyx should be @xmath86 .",
    "@xcite reported a stable increase of the orbital period of t  pyx during 19662011 , i.e. , @xmath87  yr .",
    "this period change suggests a mass transfer rate of @xmath88  yr@xmath45 for @xmath89 and a mass ratio of @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the primary ( wd , accretors ) and secondary ( main - sequence , donor ) components , respectively .",
    "this accretion rate combined with the wd mass ( @xmath93 ) suggests that t pyx is not a forced nova but rather is a natural nova because it is under the stability line in figure [ precwdmass ] .",
    "figure [ precwdmass ] also suggests the wd mass to be @xmath94 from the recurrence period of @xmath95  yr during 19662011 with @xmath88  yr@xmath45 .",
    "this value is very consistent with the above lower limit mass of @xmath93 .",
    "however , our estimate of the wd mass is inconsistent with the estimate @xmath96 by @xcite based on the time - resolved spectroscopy of t  pyx .",
    "the shortest record of recurrence periods is 1 yr of the recurrent nova m31n 2008 - 12a ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we pose a constraint of the wd mass to be @xmath97@xmath98 from figure [ pmin ] .",
    "however , a nova close to the minimum period of forced novae ( red line ) should show a very high duty cycle close to 1.0 , which means it will always be bright in the optical or x - ray region .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observed short duration of m31n 2008 - 12a ( @xmath99@xmath10018  days/1  yr ) .",
    "this suggests that @xmath101 . @xcite",
    "obtained @xmath102 from the duration of the supersoft x - ray phase and the mass accretion rate of @xmath103  yr@xmath45 .",
    "the mass accretion rate is below the stability line , so this nova should be a natural nova .",
    "the galactic recurrent nova u  sco exhibits recurrence periods of @xmath2312  yr , which indicate that the wd mass should be as massive as @xmath104 based on figure [ pmin ] .",
    "@xcite modeled the light curve of u sco and suggested the wd mass to be @xmath105 .",
    "@xcite obtained a dynamical wd mass of @xmath106 , which is consistent with hachisu et al.s value .",
    "the pair of @xmath2312  yr and @xmath107 is located above the minimum period for natural novae ( black line ) in figure [ pmin ] , indicating u  sco to be a natural nova .",
    "ci  aql is also a recurrent nova with recorded outbursts in 1917 , 1941 , and 2000 .",
    "@xcite proposed that ci  aql could outburst every @xmath99@xmath108  yr .",
    "the recurrence period of @xmath109  yr requires the wd to be as massive as @xmath110 ( a natural nova ) or @xmath111 ( a forced nova ) from figure [ pmin ] .",
    "@xcite estimated a dynamical wd mass of @xmath112 from their spectroscopic analysis .",
    "the pair of @xmath109  yr and @xmath113 is located above but close to the minimum period of natural novae ( black line ) in figure [ pmin ] . in such a case ,",
    "the duty cycle ( hydrogen burning on / cycle duration ) of the model is rather high and not consistent with the observation .",
    "therefore , we prefer a mass close to the upper bound @xmath114 or higher .",
    "this is consistent with the mass @xmath115 estimated by @xcite for ci  aql from their light curve fitting .",
    "thus , we have no observational evidence of forced novae .",
    "there is , however , a possibility that forced novae will be discovered in the future .",
    "for example , we consider a wind - fed type mass accretion , in which a wd accretes a part of cool wind from a red - giant companion after evacuated by the nova ejecta . in the case of rs  oph @xcite , which is not a forced nova but a natural nova , the post - outburst minimum ( @xmath116 mag fainter than the normal quiescent phase ) lasted about 300 days from @xmath117 to @xmath118 days after the outburst ( see , e.g. , figure 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting the wind - fed accretion to the wd resumed much later than the end of hydrogen shell burning @xmath119 days after the outburst @xcite .",
    "thus , the mass accretion can be switched off for a long time in some binary configuration .",
    "if a similar system exists and its mass - accretion rate is higher than the stability limit , we could have a forced nova .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we calculated nova outbursts using a henyey - type evolution code with high mass accretion rates above the stability line , i.e. , @xmath25 . in our models",
    ", we assume that the accretion disk is not blown off by optically thick winds ( envelope mass ejection ) and that the mass accretion continues throughout the shell flash . then , we confirmed that steady hydrogen shell burning is occurring in a zone above the stability line of the wd mass versus mass accretion rate diagram .",
    "thus , we obtained a first shell flash and subsequent steady hydrogen shell burning for the mass accretion rate above the stability line .",
    "if we stop mass accretion during the wind phase ( mass ejection phase ) of nova outbursts , the resuming time of mass accretion controls the subsequent shell flashes even for a mass accretion rate above the stability line .",
    "we named such shell flashes `` forced novae . ''",
    "the recurrence periods of forced novae can be freely designed by changing the resuming time of mass accretion . for a given wd mass and mass accretion rate ,",
    "the shortest recurrence period is obtained under the condition that we resume the mass accretion immediately after the end of a shell flash . for a fixed wd mass ,",
    "the shortest recurrence period thus obtained attains a minimum at some mass accretion rate .",
    "the minimum recurrence periods are obtained for various wd masses .",
    "we clarified the reason why in some recent works the claim has been made that nova outbursts have occurred above the stability line instead of steady - state burning .",
    "these works used calculations with manipulated mass accretion ; successive shell flashes are shaped by assuming a periodic mass accretion .",
    "we constrain the wd mass of t pyx to be @xmath104 from its recurrence periods even for the case of forced novae .",
    "this is not consistent with uthas et al.s ( 2010 ) claim of @xmath96 based on the time - resolved spectroscopy .",
