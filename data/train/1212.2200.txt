    "one of the major scientific thrusts from recent years has been to try to harness quantum phenomena to dramatically increase the performance of a wide variety of classical information processing devices . in particular",
    ", it is generally accepted that quantum computers and communication systems promise to revolutionize our information infrastructure .    with the prospect of satellite based quantum communications ,",
    "it is necessary to understand the dynamics of qubits in such an operational environment . to this end",
    ", a considerable amount of work has been done to understand how entanglement and quantum information are affected by lorentz transformations in the context of special relativity @xcite .",
    "further work has been reported on the effects of spacetime curvature on quantum information @xcite .",
    "most of this research is based on the analysis of spinor and vector quantum fields coupled to gravity in the context of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the specific analysis of qubits in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes produced by rotating bodies , such as the one represented by the kerr metric , has not been considered in the literature .",
    "these spacetimes are important because of the lense - thirring effect , which does not have a classical counterpart . here , spacetime is _ dragged _ by the rotating sources of the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of spin-@xmath0 particles in the gravitational field of rotating bodies has been studied in considerable detail @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the effect of gravitational frame dragging on orbiting qubits . in section 2",
    "we offer a brief overview of the wigner rotations induced on qubit states due to spacetime curvature @xcite .",
    "the structure of kerr spacetime , geodesics , and associated tetrad fields and connection 1-forms are presented in section 3 .",
    "the analysis of qubits in kerr spacetime is presented in section 4 .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the case of an equatorial radial fall with zero angular momentum and equatorial circular orbits .",
    "general coordinate transformations in general relativity are described through the group @xmath2 made of all real regular @xmath3 matrices . however , it is known that @xmath2 does not have a spinor representation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the best way to study the dynamics of spin-@xmath0 particles in gravitational fields is through the use of local inertial frames defined at each point of spacetime @xcite .",
    "these local inertial frames are defined through a tetrad field @xmath4 , which is a set of four linearly independent coordinate 4-vector fields @xcite . in what follows",
    ", latin indices @xmath5 refer to coordinates in the local inertial frame , while greek indices @xmath6 correspond to the general coordinate system .",
    "the minkowsky metric @xmath7 in the local inertial frame and the spacetime metric tensor @xmath8 are related through the tetrad field : @xmath9 in a similar manner , the momentum in the local inertial frame is related to the momentum in the general coordinate system by : @xmath10    then , any change in the momentum in the local inertial frame can be expressed as a combination of changes due to ( 1 ) external forces other than gravity @xmath11 , and ( 2 ) spacetime geometry effects ( gravity ) @xmath12 : @xmath13 where : @xmath14 and the connection 1-forms are defined by : @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the covariant derivative .",
    "notice that @xmath17 is the 4-acceleration due to external forces other than gravity .    as the particle moves",
    ", its momentum in the local inertial frame will transform under a local lorentz transformation : @xmath18 where : @xmath19 in the absence of external forces , @xmath20 and the lorentz transformation in the local inertial frame is simply given by : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the 4-velocity of the particle .",
    "the associated infinitesimal wigner rotation that affects the particle s spin is given by : @xmath23 where : @xmath24 and its spin-@xmath0 representation is : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are tha pauli matrices @xcite .",
    "therefore , the wigner rotation for a particle that moves over a finite proper time interval is : @xmath27 where @xmath28 indicates a time ordered product and the integral is taken along the path of the particle .",
    "the kerr metric is a solution to einstein s field equations that represents a stationary axisymmetric spacetime produced by a rotating object of mass @xmath29 and angular momentum @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "this solution can be proved to be unique if one demands that : ( 1 ) the spacetime tends to the minkowsky form as @xmath31 and ( 2 ) the geometry is non - singular outside of a smooth closed convex event horizon . under these conditions",
    "the kerr metric is expressed in terms of the boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath32 in planck units @xmath33 as : @xmath34 where : @xmath35    the schwarzschild metric is obtained in the no - rotation limit : @xmath36 where : @xmath37 as a consequence , all the results presented in the following sections also apply to the schwarzschild metric by setting the limit @xmath38 .",
    "the kerr metric has two event horizons related to coordinate singularities @xcite .",
    "these occur on the surfaces : @xmath39 because of penrose s cosmic censorship hypothesis , one has to demand the existence of event horizons that cover the true singularity , therefore avoiding troublesome naked singularities @xcite . in the kerr metric case ,",
    "the true singularity occurs at @xmath40 . as a consequence , event horizons in kerr spacetime",
    "exist if : @xmath41    in addition , the kerr geometry has two stationary limit surfaces @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 .",
    "these are infinite redshift surfaces where the rotation of the compact object is so strong that any test particle is forced to rotate with the source , even if it has an arbitrarily large angular momentum @xcite . for the case of the kerr metric",
    ", these surfaces are found in : @xmath44 as a consequence , the kerr spacetime geometry has the following structure : @xmath45    in the following discussions we will concentrate on qubits traveling in regions exterior to the stationary limit surface , where the boyer - lindquist coordinates are well defined .",
    "it is possible , however , to analyze the interior of @xmath46 by using eddington - finkelstein coordinates , which provide an analytic continuation that extends the range of validity of the equations @xcite .",
    "this case will be analyzed in a future paper .",
    "it is convenient to choose the tetrad field that defines a local inertial frame in each point of kerr spacetime as follows @xcite : @xmath47 where : @xmath48 let us remark that the choice of tetrad field is somewhat arbitrary , and it could be defined in a different way @xcite . in the present case , the tetrad represents the local inertial frame of a `` hovering '' observer .    in the equatorial plane ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "the non - zero connection 1-forms associated to our choice of tetrad field are given by @xcite : @xmath50      the geodesics in a gravitational field can be obtained using the lagrangian : @xmath51 and the associated euler - lagrange equations : @xmath52 where : @xmath53 normalized as : @xmath54 for massive test particles of unit mass ( @xmath55 ) .    in the equatorial plane ( @xmath49 ) , the geodesic equations for free falling massive particles",
    "are found to be : @xmath56 because the kerr metric tensor is independent of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are integration constants associated to the covariant components of the particle s 4-momentum that are conserved along the geodesic : @xmath61 these two conserved quantities corespond to energy and angular momentum conservation , respectively @xcite .",
    "because of the frame dragging due to the rotation of the compact object , the geometry induces an angular velocity to a free falling particle , even if it has zero angular momentum ( @xmath62 ) : @xmath63 in the following section we will explore the effect of this frame dragging on qubit states .",
    "finally , it is important to recall that , in contrast to orbits in schwartzschild spacetime , non - equatorial orbits in kerr spacetime are not constrained to a plane @xcite .",
    "then , in the sake of simplicity , we will restrict our discussion to equatorial trajectories ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we will limit our discussion of the effects of frame dragging in kerr spacetime to equatorial radial falls and equatorial circular orbits .",
    "a radial fall is a free falling particle with zero angular momentum ( @xmath62 ) and dropped from rest at @xmath31 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the geodesics are given by : @xmath65    we would like to use these geodesics to express the free falling motion of spin-@xmath0 particles .",
    "however , we have to recall that spin and curvature are coupled in a non - trivial manner @xcite . as a consequence , the motion of spinning particles , either classical or quantum , does not follow geodesics @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the deviation from geodetic motion is very small , except for the case of supermassive compact objects and/or ultra - relativistic test particles @xcite",
    ".    however , in the two examples considered in this paper , the @xmath1 non - geodesic motion induced by the coupling between the spin and the curvature can be safely ignored . indeed , from the geodesic equations we can observe",
    "that , in the regime of interest , the geodetic motion is not ultra - relativistic : @xmath66 furthermore , let us consider the angular velocity @xmath67 produced by the non - geodetic motion that results from the spin - curvature coupling @xcite . if we require for this correction to be of about the same value as the maximum angular velocity due to frame dragging : @xmath68 which implies a circular orbit of femtometric radius around a supermassive black hole .    using the geodesic equations we can calculate the 6 non - zero lorentz transformations that describe the motion of the particle in the local inertial frame : @xmath69 these lorentz transformations represent boosts on the 1 and 3 directions , and rotations over the 2-axis .",
    "the associated infinitesimal wigner rotation is found to be : @xmath70 and the total angular rotation of the particle s spin , which is solely due to gravitational effects , is given by : @xmath71 where the integration takes place over the path of the free falling particle .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ]   induced by frame dragging on a free falling particle with zero angular momentum in the equatorial plane .",
    "the two solid lines correspond to the upper and lower bounds of the angular momentum of the compact object ( @xmath72 , respectively).,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure 1 shows the rotation angle @xmath73 induced by frame dragging on a free falling particle with zero angular momentum launched from rest at infinity .",
    "thus , the integration over the radial coordinate is taken from infinite to @xmath74 .",
    "as previously discussed , the minimum value of @xmath74 is taken to be the stationary limit surface @xmath46 , which takes the value of @xmath75 in the equatorial plane .    furthermore , to guarantee the existence of event horizons and avoid naked singularities , the ratio @xmath76 is only allowed to take values between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "when @xmath79 the spacetime geometry reduces to schwarzschild and a radially falling particle with zero angular momentum does not experience any rotation ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "as the rotation of the compact body increases , so does the wigner rotation angle .",
    "that is , in this case the spin rotation angle @xmath73 is completely due to frame dragging .",
    "the two solid lines in figure 2 correspond to the upper and lower bounds of the angular momentum of the compact object .",
    "the maximal rotation is reached at the stationary limit surface and has a value of @xmath81 .",
    "the geodesics for a circular orbit ( @xmath82 ) of constant radius @xmath74 in the equatorial plane ( @xmath49 ) are given by : @xmath83 and the constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 take the following values : @xmath84 where the upper and lower signs correspond to counter - rotating and co - rotating circular orbits , respectively .",
    "it can be observed that the values of @xmath85 an @xmath75 have a further restriction .",
    "indeed , from the equations for @xmath59 and @xmath60 we have the condition for circular orbits in kerr metric : @xmath86 which combined with the bound from penrose s cosmic censorship hypothesis leads to the limiting values : @xmath87 as in the previous case , it can be observed that in the regime of interest , the motion is not ultra - relativistic . indeed : @xmath88 and once more , the @xmath1 non - geodesic motion induced by the coupling between the spin and the curvature can be safely ignored .",
    "the lorentz transformations that describe the motion of the particle in the local inertial frame are : @xmath89 these transformations correspond to a boost in the 1-direction and a rotation over the 2-direction .",
    "the associated infinitesimal wigner rotation is : @xmath90 and therefore , the wigner rotation per circular orbit is : @xmath91 because @xmath92 and @xmath93 have fixed values , independent of the coordinates .    to analyze the gravitational effects on the spin of the orbiting particle",
    ", we need to substract the @xmath94 due to the trivial rotation of the particle around the compact object : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the spin rotation angle ( per orbit ) entrely due to gravitational effects .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]   ( per orbit ) for a particle moving in an equatorial circular orbit in kerr spacetime .",
    "the two solid lines correspond to the upper and lower bounds imposed by the existence of event horizons .",
    "the two dashed lines correspond to the upper and lower bounds imposed by the dynamics of circular orbits .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to circular orbits in schwarzschild spacetime.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the possible values for the spin rotation angle ( per orbit ) due to gravity @xmath96 for a particle moving on an equatorial circular orbit in kerr spacetime are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the two solid lines correspond to the upper and lower bounds imposed by the existence of event horizons @xmath97 .",
    "that is , the upper and lower bounds corresponds to the maximal angular momentum of the compact object : @xmath98 notice the dotted line in figure 2 , which represents the case where the kerr metric reduces to the schwarzschild metric ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the bounds on the angular momentum of the compact object imposed by the dynamics of the circular orbit further restric the space of values for @xmath96 .",
    "the two maximal values correspond to : @xmath99 and are shown as dashed lines in figure 2 .",
    "these bounds generalize the well known gravitational effect that forbids circular orbits of arbitrarily small radius in schwarzschild spacetimes .",
    "the spin dynamic described by figure 2 is expected . even in the case of a non - rotating compact object ( @xmath79 ) ,",
    "the gravitational field affects the particle s spin by @xmath100 .",
    "if the particle co - rotates with the compact object , @xmath101 , then the spin rotation angle increases : @xmath102 .",
    "if the particle counter - rotates with the compact object , @xmath103 , and the spin rotation angle decreases : @xmath104 .",
    "however , notice that except for @xmath31 , there is no circular orbit which completely mitigates the gravitational effects on the spin : @xmath105 . also , the spin rotation angle is bounded for all circular orbits : @xmath106 .",
    "the spin rotation is additive on completion of a single orbit .",
    "thus , the spin rotation angle after @xmath107 orbits around the compact object is given by : @xmath108 .",
    "let us consider qubit states moving in kerr spacetime in an equatorial radial fall with zero angular momentum or on an equatorial circular orbit .",
    "the change to the @xmath109 basis states is given by : @xmath110 then , if we consider a general qubit state expressed in the @xmath109 basis : @xmath111 it will transforms as : @xmath112 if the orbiting qubit is measured in the @xmath113 basis , the probability of measuring the orthogonal state is : @xmath114 then , unless the unitary operation that inverts the gravitational wigner rotation is applied to the orbiting state , @xmath115 could lead to errors in some quantum communication protocols or in epr - type experiments .    for example , from figure 2 we can observe that there are configurations of @xmath116 such that @xmath117 . in these cases the associated error is @xmath118 . as a consequence ,",
    "the channel capacity of a wide class of quantum channels will be zero .",
    "similar errors are incurred in the study of epr experiments in kerr spacetime .",
    "for instance , let us consider @xmath119 as a set of directions for the measurement of epr states @xcite .",
    "then , the bell s inequality will take the modified form : @xmath120 that is , the violation to bell s inequality _ appears _ to be reduced by the presence of a wigner rotation angle @xmath121 .",
    "however , it is important to note that this is not the case .",
    "indeed , the wigner rotation is a local unitary operation which does not affect entanglement .",
    "the apparent decrease in the violation of bell s inequality is due to the observer using an inadequate set of directions @xmath119 .",
    "if the observer knows the exact orbital paths of the particles , then he can derive a modified set of directions @xmath122 that maximaly violate bell s inequality .",
    "in this paper we studied the effect of gravitational frame dragging on orbiting qubits .",
    "in particular we considered the kerr metric and the case of qubits in equatorial radial fall with zero angular momentum and in equatorial circular orbits .",
    "we provided analytical equations and numerical simulations that describe the effect of gravity on a spin-@xmath0 particle . even though the spin rotations induced by gravity are small , they are comulative over the number of orbits .",
    "also , as the resulting wigner rotation is an unitary operation , the state of a particle can be restored by applying the inverse operation . however",
    ", this is true only if the exact transformation is known",
    ". this may not be the case in some applications , for instance , in satellite dynamics .",
    "as such , it is important to understand quantum information in the presence of a kerr metric , which is the simplest exact solution to einstein s field equations that describes the spacetime nearby to earth .                        p.m. alsing , g.j . stephenson , and p. kilian , `` spin - induced non - geodesic motion , gyroscopic precession , wigner rotation and epr correlations of massive spin-@xmath0 particles in a gravitational field '' , arxiv:0902.1396v1 [ quant - ph ] , 2009 .",
