    "synthesis and application of magnetic nanoparticles is a fast burgeoning field which has potential to bring significant advance in many fields , ranging from magnetic nanoparticles based cancer therapy to sensors @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of nanoparticle are important since they enable the manipulation of particles behaviour remotely and therefore provide the means to direct a particles orientation and translation .",
    "janus particles ( jps ) are particles with two dissimilar faces having unique material properties @xcite .",
    "jps provide us with the ability to complete challenging tasks that would be impossible with isotropic particles .",
    "magnetic jps combine magnetic properties with anisotropy and thus are potential building blocks for complex structures that can be assembled from a particle suspension and can be directed easily by external magnetic fields .",
    "jps with ferromagnetic or paramagnetic properties of various anisotropic shapes have been proposed to have potential application in probing the rheology of complex fluid interfaces @xcite .",
    "magnetic jps have interesting properties for their application in microfluidics and as nanodelivery systems . in order to control magnetic jps",
    "it is very important to understand their magnetization behaviour .",
    "masking is the simplest and was one of the first techniques developed for the synthesis of magnetic jps . in a first step ,",
    "particles were deposited onto a substrate and then the above - lying surface was coated with a thin shell of a magnetic metal . during the last years there was an increasing interest in studying the magnetic properties of spherical and hemispherical magnetic shells . in all these geometries which were investigated so far , experiment measurements , analytical calculations and micromagnetic simulations",
    "suggest the existence of three magnetic states : uniform state ( easy plane ) , vortex state and onion state @xcite . considerably less attention has been devoted to non spherical shells , such as spheroids .    in this work ,",
    "we present micromagnetic simulations of nano hemispheroidal shells , by using nmag simulator @xcite .",
    "the simulations were made for a variety of shells thicknesses and sizes ranging from 5 to 10 nm and 1 to 50 nm ( inside dimensions ) , respectively .",
    "we find the phase diagram of equilibrium magnetization states in these shells .",
    "in contrast to the hemispherical magnetic shells which have only three magnetic phases , the hemispheroidal magnetic shells have four magnetic configurations : two phases with homogeneous magnetization ( easy axis and easy plane ) and two phases inhomogeneous ( onion and vortex ) . the easy axis structure is encountered only in the small and elongated hemispheroidal magnetic shells .",
    "hereafter we consider the vortex magnetization profiles and the limitation and applicability of different vortex ansatzes are discussed .",
    "moreover , we investigate the total energy density for each of the magnetic distributions as a function of the hemispheroidal shell dimensions .",
    "the starting point of magnetization dynamics at zero temperature is from the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation ,    @xmath0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath2 is the damping constant .",
    "there are some publicly available packages for solving llg equation , like oommf @xcite , mumax@xmath3 @xcite and nmag @xcite .",
    "oommf and mumax@xmath3 are based on discretizing space into small cuboid cells , respectively .",
    "one advantage of this method ( often called ` finite differences ' ) is that the demag field can be computed very efficiently . on the other hand",
    ", this method works less well if the geometry shape does not align with a cartesian grid since the boundary is represented as a staircase pattern .",
    "nmag s finite elements discretize space into many small tetrahedra .",
    "the corresponding approach is based on the fredkin koehler hybrid finite element / boundary element method ( fem / bem ) @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method ( over @xmath4 and oommf s approach ) is that curved and spherical geometries can be spatially resolved much more accurately .",
    "however , this method of calculating the demagnetisation field is less efficient than oommf s approach for thin films . in particular ,",
    "memory requirements for the boundary element method grow as the square of the number of surface points .",
    "note that for simulation of thin films , the hybrid fem / bem is likely to require a lot of memory . in order to improve the efficiency of the hybrid fem / bem , one can employ techniques which involve some kind of approximation , for example using hierarchical matrices @xcite .",
    "the library hlib [ http://www.hlib.org ] contains implementations of this hierarchical matrix methodology .",
    "because our samples have curved geometries we choose nmag and for the big samples we use nmag with hlib .",
    "the cell size of micromagnetic simulations should be equal or smaller than the half size of the smallest feature of interest , so sampling at that length scale is sufficient to capture all relevant details . in our micromagnetic simulations it is the domain wall .",
    "for soft materials the domain wall profile is determined by competition between the exchange and demagnetization energies .",
    "therefore , it is common to define magnetostatic exchange length as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the exchange constant in j / m and @xmath7 is the saturation magnetization in a / m . in order to get reliable results , in all our simulations",
    "the cell size was smaller than half of the exchange length .",
    "good criteria for testing the reliability of the simulations is the maximum angle between two neighbouring cells . because this is such important issue nmag , provides this data .",
    "a spheroid , or ellipsoid of revolution , is a quadric surface obtained by rotating an ellipse about one of its principal axes ; in other words , an ellipsoid with two equal semi - diameters .",
    "if the ellipse is rotated about its major axis , the result is a prolate ( elongated ) spheroid .",
    "while rotating about its minor axis , the result is an oblate ( flattened ) spheroid .",
    "the systems studied are hemispheroidal shells with permalloy parameters : exchange coupling @xmath8 , saturation magnetization @xmath9 and a megnetocrystalline anisotropy was neglected .",
    "therefore , the exchange length is about 5 nm . we created the shells by rotating a half elliptical ring around the z axis .",
    "the internal dimensions of the shells are of a half spheroid with semi - principal axes of length @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "the outside dimensions of the shells are of a half spheroid with semi - principal axes of length @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "we simulate the remanent states starting with two different directions of hysteresis loops : along the x direction ( in the cutting plane of the hemispheroidal shell ) and along the z direction ( perpendicular to the cutting plane ) .",
    "depending on the dimensions of the hemispheroidal shell , there are one or two remanent states .",
    "the ground state is the one with the minimum energy .",
    "following such a scheme , we construct phase diagram of equilibrium magnetization structures in the hemispheroidal shell . since we have three parameters , which define the hemispheroidal shell , @xmath10 , @xmath12 and the thickness of the shell , our phase diagram is a three dimensional .",
    "we choose to show the phase diagram with two dimensional plots for clarity ( see figure @xmath18 ) .",
    "the general properties of the phase diagram are as follows .",
    "the ground state of the smallest hemispheroidal shells is the homogeneous easy plane state . as @xmath10 and @xmath11 increase",
    "we switch to onion state and then to vortex state .",
    "the vortex state becomes much more preferable while moving to larger thicknesses .",
    "in addition , for high aspect ratio ( @xmath19 ) the homogeneous easy axis becomes preferable .",
    "the total energy densities were obtained for different hemispheroidal shells sizes and magnetization distributions , the results of these simulations are presented in fig @xmath20 . for the onion and vortex",
    "states the energies were taken from the zero field data in the hysteresis loops simulations . in order to find the energy density of the single domain z axis and the single domain xy plane in zero magnetic field ,",
    "much simpler simulations are used ; we put the system in the single domain configurations xy plane ( @xmath21 ) , single domain z axis @xmath22 and simulate the energy .",
    "figure @xmath20(a ) depicts the total energy densities of wide hemispheroidal shells ( @xmath10=40 nm ) with thickness=5 nm . due to the magnetostatic energy ,",
    "the total energy density of the single domain xy plain increases with @xmath12 .",
    "while @xmath12 increases , the total energy density of the onion state increases when @xmath2330 nm and decreases when @xmath24 30 nm ; the decrease of the total energy density when @xmath24 30 nm is very small and therefore unnoticeable in the figure . while @xmath12 decreases , the total energy density of the vortex state and the single domain z axis increase .",
    "the total energy density of the single domain z axis is very high for all value of @xmath12 and decrease with increasing length of @xmath12 .",
    "figure @xmath20(b ) shows the total energy densities of narrow hemispheroidal shells ( @xmath10=10 nm ) with thickness=5 nm .",
    "as can be seen the energies for the single domain easy axis and the single domain easy plane behave qualitative the same as in figure @xmath20(a ) .",
    "there are two main differences between figure @xmath20(a ) and figure @xmath20(b ) : for @xmath10=10 nm the vortex sate is no more a reachable metastable state and the the single domain z axis becomes to be the ground state for @xmath25 nm .    in the absence of intrinsic anisotropy energy , the reason for all these various ground states",
    "is the competition between two energies : the exchange energy and stray field energy . a general solution of the stray field is given by potential theory .",
    "the volume magnetostatic charge density @xmath26 and the surface magnetostatic charge density @xmath27 are defined in terms of the normalised magnetization : @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the outward surface normal . for the vortex state ,",
    "the surface and the volume magnetostatic charges are almost absent . in the vortex distribution",
    "there is a stray field only inside the vortex core . for the homogeneous magnetization distribution",
    "the total energy contains only the contribution of surface magnetostatic charges .",
    "these surface magnetostatic charges are the source of demagnetization field which is opposite to the sample magnetization . in general , the demagnetization field along a short axis is stronger than that along a long axis .",
    "due to demagnetization field , the single domain z axis becomes energetically favorable with the particle size decreasing and the aspect ratio @xmath19 increasing .",
    "for nano particles the single domain configuration becomes the lowest energy state when the particle diameter becomes comparable or smaller than the exchange length .",
    "therefore , the smallest nano hemispheroidal shell ( @xmath10=1 , @xmath11=1 and thickness 5 nm ) in our simulation has a single domain xy configuration .     for thickness=5 nm and different semi - principal axis ( a ) @xmath10=40 nm ( b ) @xmath10=10 nm .",
    "the dashed lines are guides for eyes . ]",
    "the typical vortex magnetization configuration for an oblate hemispheroidal shell and a prolate hemispheroidal shell are depicted in figures @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "while for the oblate hemispheroidal shell we can see clearly a core in the middle of the vortex , in the prolate hemispheroidal shell the core is spread all over the vortex .",

    "nm , @xmath33 nm and thickness 5 nm .",
    "the color code represents the normalized z component of the magnetization , shows that the core is not only in the center of the vortex . ]",
    "using the angular parametrisation for the normalised magnetisation @xmath34 one can describe the vortex solution as follows :    @xmath35     for hemispheroidal shells ( thickness=5 nm ) .",
    "( a ) symbols correspond to the micromagnetic simulations for semi - principal axis @xmath36 nm and different @xmath12 .",
    "( b ) symbols indicate the micromagnetic simulations results for semi - principal axis @xmath37 nm and three different @xmath12 values .",
    "solid lines are the best ansatzes which fit to the simulations results . ]    here , @xmath38 are the cylinder coordinates , @xmath39 is the vortex polarity which describes the vortex core magnetization ( up or down ) and @xmath40 is the vortex chirality ( clockwise or counterclockwise ) .",
    "the function @xmath41 describes the out of surface structure of the vortex . in order to find a good fit to the oblate hemispheroidal shell , it is instructive to use an analogy with a vortex profile of the planar disk .",
    "there are known several models for describing the vortex in a disk shaped particles .",
    "for example the ansatz by usov and peschany @xcite and the kravchuk s ansatz @xcite which describes the vortex structure in disks and rings , @xmath42 where the parameter @xmath43 determines the radius of the vortex core .",
