    "hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) are a natural consequence of the presence of a massive black hole ( mbh ) in the galactic center ( gc ) . at present several hvss",

    "sgr a@xmath0 is difficult to establish , however . in sesana",
    "et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) we showed that the observed velocity distribution of hvss appears to marginally disfavor the mbhb ejection mechanism , though the statistics is still rather poor .",
    "lu et  al .",
    "( 2007 , hereafter l07 ) showed that tight binary stars can be ejected by a mbhb without being tidally torn apart : the discovery of just one _ hypervelocity binary star _",
    "( hvb ) in forthcoming deep stellar surveys could then provide evidence of the existence of a massive or intermediate - mass black hole companion to sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "the analysis of l07 is the starting point of this letter .",
    "our goal is to provide an estimate of the number of hvbs expected to be produced by the in - spiral of an imbh onto sgr a@xmath0 , using the results of scattering experiments between a mbhb and a bound stellar cusp discussed in sesana et  al .",
    "( 2008 , hereafter s08 ) .",
    "we will show that a short burst of hvss accompanied by a few hvbs would be an incontrovertible signature of a recent in - spiral .",
    "by contrast , depending on the properties of the population of binary stars in the gc , it is possible that a fast binary black hole in - spiral and coalescence may occur without the ejection of a single hvb in the galactic halo .",
    "consider a star of mass @xmath7 orbiting the primary hole @xmath8 , and assume , for simplicity , that the secondary hole @xmath2 @xmath9 is in a circular orbit of radius @xmath10 around @xmath8 .",
    "when the star experiences a close encounter with @xmath2 , its velocity is of order the mbhb circular velocity , @xmath11 .",
    "a star having closest approach distance to @xmath2 equal to @xmath12 will be subject to a velocity variation @xmath13 as a result of a ( specific ) force @xmath14 applied for an encounter timescale @xmath15 ( quinlan 1996 ; y03 ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . since in the limit of close energetic encounters",
    "the ejection velocity of the star is , to first order , @xmath19 , equation ( [ deltav ] ) shows two important scalings : ( 1 ) , @xmath20 is inversely proportional to the square root of the closest approach distance to @xmath2 during the interaction ; and ( 2 ) , the closest approach distance required to eject a star above a given speed ( in units of @xmath21 ) scales with the mbhb mass ratio @xmath22 . to verify these simple analytical estimates ,",
    "we have performed 15 sets of 3-body scattering experiments , using the setup described in s08 , for mass ratios @xmath23 , and eccentricities @xmath24 . in each set we integrated 5,000 orbits drawn from an isotropic distribution of stars bound to @xmath8 , and recorded @xmath20 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( the closest approach distance to @xmath8 ) .",
    "the stellar semi  major axis @xmath27 is randomly sampled from fifty logarithmic bins spanning the range @xmath28 .",
    "the stellar specific angular momentum @xmath29 is sampled in the interval @xmath30 $ ] , according to an equal probability distribution in @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the specific angular momentum of a circular orbit of radius @xmath27 .",
    "a population of stars with such distribution in @xmath31 has mean eccentricity @xmath33 , corresponding to an isotropic stellar distribution ( e.g. quinlan , hernquist , & sigurdsson 1995 ) .",
    "we stress that , on average , the ejection velocity does not depend on the details of the initial keplerian orbit of the star around @xmath8 , but only on @xmath25 .",
    "results are plotted in figure  [ fig1 ] for an assumed mbhb eccentricity @xmath34 .",
    "the scaling @xmath35 breaks down for encounters closer than @xmath36 : the ejection velocity tends to @xmath37 , the maximum ejection speed at infinity predicted by simple arguments on elastic scattering .",
    "we checked that the precise value of @xmath38 does not play a significant role on determining @xmath39 .",
    "the third body in our experiments can be thought of either as a single star or as a stellar binary .",
    "a binary star of mass @xmath40 and semimajor axis @xmath41 is broken apart by tidal forces if its center - of - mass approaches a compact object of mass @xmath42 within the distance ( e.g. miller et al .",
    "2005 ) @xmath43 such ",
    "breakup \" radius must be compared with the closest approach distance @xmath25 required for a hypervelocity ejection . if @xmath44 , a stellar binary may be kicked to high speeds while preserving its integrity ( l07 ) .",
    "our three - body approximation does not account for the internal degrees of freedom of the stellar binary .",
    "in particular , a strong interaction with the mbhb can result in the merger of the two stars .",
    "simulations of stellar binary - binary interaction in the context of star cluster dynamics show that a merger event is a quite common dynamical outcome ( fregeau et al .",
    "however , the dynamical regime we consider is different .",
    "the stellar binary experiences a complex weak dynamical interaction with the mbhb ( that is unlikely to affect the binary internal structure ) . ejection or breakup is caused instead by an instantaneous strong encounter with one of the two mbhs .",
    "simulations of strong three body encounters involving a stellar binary and a single mbh ( with parameters similar to those considered here ; ginsburg & loeb 2007 ) show that the merger of the two stars happens at most in @xmath4510% of the cases .    to make definite predictions , the results of our scattering experiments must be scaled to the gc .",
    "the main parameters of our mw models are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] ( see sesana et al . 2007 and s08 for details ) .",
    "the reservoir of stars in the central parsec of the mw is well described by a power - law density profile , @xmath46 , around a @xmath47 mbh . here",
    "@xmath48 is the characteristic radius within which the total stellar mass is @xmath49 ( the `` radius of influence '' of sgr a@xmath0 ) .",
    "as the hypothetical secondary hole @xmath2 sinks in , it starts ejecting background stars when the total stellar mass enclosed in its orbit is @xmath50 ( matsubayashi et al .",
    "following s08 , we set the mbhb at initial separation @xmath51 such that @xmath52 . from @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath48 , and @xmath22 we can derive the parameters @xmath51 , @xmath55 , and the period @xmath56 .",
    "we take a velocity threshold for escaping the mw potential of @xmath57 at @xmath48 ( e.g. smith et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the horizontal lines in figure  [ fig1 ] depict the quantity @xmath58 at orbital separation @xmath59 and @xmath60 , while vertical lines mark the tidal disruption radius @xmath61 in units of @xmath10 for the same two mbhb separations .",
    "an equal - mass stellar binary with @xmath62 , and @xmath63 au was assumed .",
    "the figure shows that , on average , stars must approach @xmath2 within a distance @xmath64 in order to be ejected .",
    "most binary stars will then be tidally disrupted during the strong interaction with @xmath2 , and only a few tight binaries with @xmath65 au may be survive intact and become hvbs .",
    "note that , while stellar binaries can be also broken apart by @xmath8 ( @xmath66 ) , it is the secondary hole @xmath2 that is largely responsible for dissociating candidate hvbs .",
    "this is because there is no connection between tidal dissociation by @xmath8 and hypervelocity kicks , while a close approach to @xmath2 , required to gain hypervelocity , can break up the binary .",
    ".parameters of the different models .",
    "the quantities @xmath67 , and @xmath55 are , respectively , the stellar cusp slope , the influence radius of sgr a@xmath0 , the stellar density at @xmath48 , the mbhb mass ratio , its separation when ejections start , the mbhb orbital period and circular velocity at @xmath51 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "to quantify the fraction of binary stars that are not disrupted by @xmath2 ( and @xmath8 ) , we need to specify their mass and semi - major distributions . in our _ default model _ , we assume a log - flat distribution of semi - major axis , @xmath68 in the range @xmath69 au ( heacox 1998 ) .",
    "the lower limit is set by the contact separation of two solar - mass stars , while the upper limit considers that binaries with @xmath70au are unlikely to survive the dense stellar environment of the gc ( e.g. y03 ) .",
    "we have also run a case with the distribution of semi - major axis arising from a log - normal distribution of binary periods @xmath71 : @xmath72 . \\label{pnorm}\\ ] ] here @xmath73 is a normalization constant , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and the period @xmath71 is measured in days ( duquennoy & major 1991 ) .",
    "the above semi - major axis distributions are coupled to two different choices of the stellar binary member s mass function ( for a total of 4 different models ) .",
    "we either assume all binaries to be composed by two equal solar - mass stars ( @xmath76 , _ default model _ ) , or to follow a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) in the range @xmath77 for @xmath78 while @xmath79 is randomly chosen in the mass range @xmath80 .",
    "we shall discuss later the effect of these different assumptions on our results .    to estimate the fraction of stellar binaries that survive the interaction with the binary black hole and",
    "are ejected intact as hvbs , we proceed as follows . for fixed @xmath22 and @xmath38",
    ", we consider orbital separations in the range @xmath81 , select from our 5,000 simulated orbits those resulting in an ejection with @xmath82 , and denote their number with @xmath83 .",
    "we then assume that each of these  ejection orbits \" is followed by a binary stellar system with parameters ( @xmath84 drawn from the distributions described above , and calculate the radii @xmath61 and @xmath85 using equation ( [ rtd ] ) . finally ,",
    "if during the chaotic interaction with the mbh pair it is @xmath86 or @xmath87 , the stellar binary is counted as  disrupted before ejection \" , and added to @xmath88 .",
    "the fraction of hvbs as a function of @xmath10 is then @xmath89 results are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] for our default model with mbhb eccentricity @xmath90 .",
    "the fraction of undisrupted hvbs is of order @xmath91 , dropping to @xmath92 if the distribution of of semi - major axis is derived from equation [ pnorm ] , similar fractions are obtained for all the eccentricity values we sampled .",
    "surviving hypervelocity binaries have @xmath93 au , i.e. only tight binary stars can be ejected undisrupted .",
    "it is clear from the figure that @xmath94 and @xmath95 do not significantly change as the mbhb shrinks .",
    "we can understand this result by noting that @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 . the ejection velocity ( in physical units ) does not depend then on mbhb separation , but only on the minimum approach distance to @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] also shows that the quantities @xmath94 and @xmath95 decrease slightly with decreasing black hole mass ratios @xmath22 .",
    "this occurs because @xmath98 , while @xmath99 , i.e. the more massive the secondary hole the weaker the interaction required to kick a star above a given speed . if @xmath22 is ( say ) three times smaller , a binary star must approach @xmath2 at a distance three times smaller to be ejected .",
    "but as the breakup radius @xmath61 decreases by just a factor @xmath100 , fewer tighter stellar binaries can survive undisrupted the tidal field of @xmath2 .",
    "we can now estimate the rate at which binary stars would be ejected into the mw halo by an imbh spiralling into sgr a@xmath0 . in s08 , we self - consistently computed the orbital evolution of such an imbh in terms of @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( see figure 8 in s08 ) , and estimated the stellar mass ejection rate @xmath103 . here , we assume that a fraction @xmath104 of scattered stars are binaries , and account for the evolving mbhb eccentricity during orbital decay by linearly interpolating the fraction @xmath105 along the correct @xmath106 curve . the ejection rate of hvbs can be written as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the mean stellar mass .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] for our default model and @xmath109 .",
    "the hvb ejection rate peaks between @xmath110 yr@xmath111 over a timescale of @xmath112 yr , depending on @xmath22 . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the ejection rate of hvss by the in - spiralling imbh ( s08 ) , as well as the rate of hvss produced by the tidal disruption of a tight stellar binary by a single mbh in sgr a@xmath0 ( hills mechanism ) , as estimated by y03 . in all the cases",
    "studied , the total number of hvbs , @xmath113 is small compared to the expected number of hvss .",
    "we find @xmath114 for @xmath115 , respectively . if the @xmath41 distribution is log - normal ( equation  [ pnorm ] ) , the fraction of tight binaries is reduced and the number of hvbs drops by about a factor of 2 .",
    "moreover , in the case of a salpeter imf , @xmath116 and @xmath117 is further reduced by the same factor ( see eq .  [ rate ] ) .",
    "the number of hvbs would trivially increase linearly with @xmath104 .",
    "the number of ejected hypervelocity binaries is well approximated by @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the fraction of stars in binaries with @xmath120 au , and 280 ( 170 ) is the normalization constant appropriate for a log - flat ( log - normal ) @xmath41 distribution .",
    "it should be noted that our approach does not account for the binary stars that are not initially bound to the mbhb and populate its loss cone because of two - body relaxation processes .",
    "l07 estimated an hvb ejection rate for such unbound population of few@xmath121 yr@xmath111 in the case of a mbhb with @xmath122 and @xmath123 pc .",
    "such a pair is expected to have a large eccentricity ( e.g. matsubayashi et al .",
    "2007 ) and a coalescence timescale of only @xmath124 yr . for larger orbital separations , the loss cone is larger but the mean ejection velocity is accordingly smaller , leading to lower ejection rates .",
    "such rates are one dex smaller than those we derived for bound stars and @xmath125 .",
    "we have applied the hybrid approach described in s08 to compute the rate of ejection and the total number of hypervelocity binary stars produced by a hypothetical imbh orbiting sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "depending on the mass of @xmath2 and on the properties of binary stars in the central parsec of the milky way , we have shown that the number of undisrupted hvbs expelled before coalescence ranges from zero to a few dozens at most .",
    "in particular , we have found that the rapid in - spiral of a @xmath126 imbh would generate @xmath127 hvbs , assuming a stellar binary fraction of 0.1 , @xmath128 , and a log - flat distribution of stellar semi - major axis @xmath41 . a 10% binary stellar fraction with @xmath129few au",
    "is suggested by numerical simulations of dense stellar clusters ( e.g shara & hurley 2006 , portegies - zwart , mcmillan & makino 2007 ) .",
    "the number of hvbs is proportional to the mass of the imbh and inversely proportional to @xmath7 , so in the case of a top - heavy stellar mass function ( schodel et al .",
    "2007 ) , the expected number of hvbs would be lower .",
    "moreover , if the distribution of stellar binary semi - major axis is log - normal instead of log - flat , the number of tight binaries that can survive a strong interaction with the mbh pair is smaller . the combination of these factors can potentially decrease the number of expected hvbs to zero .    to conclude , while the observation of even a single hvb in the galactic halo would be a decisive proof of the recent in - spiralling of an imbh into sgr a@xmath0",
    ", it is likely that such an event would give origin to at most a handful of hvbs .",
    "therefore , the non - detection of stellar binaries in a complete survey of hypervelocity stars may not be used to rule out the existence of an imbh - sgr a@xmath0 pair in the gc .",
