    "it is also possible to model the difference of two profiles ( mean vectors ) by a polynomial without modeling the profile of each group ( see section [ subsec : example ] ) .",
    "this notion of superiority is particularly important in statistical tests for assessing new drugs ( @xcite ) .",

    ", we define an lrt for testing @xmath32 against @xmath30 . in the context of the two - sample problem , this is the test for the equality of two regression curves against the hypothesis of superiority . as we see later , it is mathematically convenient to treat the two lrts at a time .",
    "the theory of lrts for convex cone hypotheses has been developed under the name of order restricted inference ( @xcite ) .",
    "a general theorem states that the null distribution of lrt statistics is a finite mixture of chi - square distributions ( @xcite ) .",
    "when the cone has piecewise smooth boundaries , @xcite proved that the weights ( mixing probabilities ) are expressed in terms of curvature measures on boundaries .",
    "these results arise out of a geometric approach referred to as the volume - of - tubes method . using this method",

    "the main result of the present paper is the derivation of the weights associated with the cone of positive polynomials @xmath0 , that is , the null distribution of the lrt for positivity . by applying the representation ( parameterization ) theorem for the positive polynomial cone and its dual cone developed in the framework of tchebycheff systems ( @xcite ) ,",

    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : lrt ] , we present the expressions of the lrt statistics in both cases where the variance @xmath10 is known and unknown . as in most statistical tests , we can also propose simultaneous confidence bands associated with the lrt for positivity . in section [ sec : null ] , we first briefly summarize the volume - of - tubes method . in order to apply this method ,",

    "we also demonstrate an example of growth curve data analysis .    throughout the paper , we treat only the polynomial regression . however , a polynomial is just one example of tchebycheff systems .",
    "the approach developed here is applicable to other systems .",
    "another typical example is trigonometric regression @xmath38 and we can consider the testing problem for the positivity once more . in this case , by changing a variable @xmath39 , all results in the polynomial regression are translated into the trigonometric regression .",

    "these integrals are not easy to handle in general .",
