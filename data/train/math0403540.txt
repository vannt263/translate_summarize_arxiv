    "in the articles @xcite and @xcite we constructed homology functors in a geometric way .",
    "we showed that these functors which are defined on pairs of spaces satisfy the eilenberg ",
    "steenrod axioms for a generalized homology theory .",
    "let @xmath0 be a multiplicative cohomology theory ( for example singular cohomology with coefficients in a ring , or @xmath1theory ) . in this",
    "setting , the associated homology groups @xmath2 of a space @xmath3 are defined by means of of triples @xmath4 ( so  called _ cycles _ ) , where @xmath5 is a manifold , @xmath6 is a cohomology class of @xmath5 and @xmath7 is a continuous map .",
    "an equivalence relation on the set of cycles must be imposed .",
    "it includes bordism and a procedure called `` vector bundle modification '' to shift the degree of @xmath8 and the dimension of @xmath5 without leaving the class of @xmath4 .    in the case of @xmath1theory",
    "this construction goes back to some work of paul baum , cf .  for example @xcite .    on the category of differentiable manifolds and smooth maps",
    "there is also a bivariant version of this construction ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for an introductory text to bivariant theories",
    "see @xcite .",
    "these geometric approaches to homology as opposed to the usual spectral methods of stable homotopy allow surprisingly simple proofs of properties requiring orientations ( say of manifolds or maps ) . in the usual stable homotopy setting often extra considerations are needed .",
    "an illustration of this point is the proof of the poincar duality theorem .",
    "recently , the question has been raised whether in the geometric ( co)homology setting there is a simple proof of the thom isomorphism theorem .",
    "that is in fact the case and in this little note we shall prove :    let @xmath0 be a multiplicative cohomology theory and let @xmath9 be a smooth @xmath0oriented vector bundle of rank @xmath10 .",
    "then the geometric thom class @xmath11 \\in h^n ( de , se)\\ ] ] induces isomorphisms @xmath12 and @xmath13 which are inverse to each other .",
    "here @xmath14 , resp .",
    "@xmath15 is the total space of the unit ball , resp .",
    "unit sphere bundle associated to some metric on @xmath16 , and @xmath17 denotes the zero section of the ball bundle .",
    "further , the map @xmath18 sends the geometric class @xmath19 \\in h^{q+n}$ ] onto the class @xmath20 \\in h^q(x)$ ] .    to be precise , in geometric _",
    "co_homology @xmath14 should be a manifold without boundary .",
    "so one has to put @xmath21 open ball bundle in @xmath16 of a fixed radius @xmath22 .",
    "let us observe first that @xmath17 in the cycle @xmath23 avoids the sphere bundle @xmath15 and thus describes in fact a geometric cohomology class of the pair @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 \\in h^q ( x)$ ] .",

    "n } ( de , se)$ ] is represented by the composition of pull backs @xmath27    then @xmath28 represents @xmath29)$ ] . the equivalence to @xmath4",
    "is given by the isomorphism @xmath30    therefore we have shown @xmath31 let @xmath32 be a cycle representing a cohomology class @xmath33 of @xmath34 . then @xmath35 is represented by the pull back diagram @xmath36    multiplication with the thom class is given by the pull back",
    "diagram @xmath37 now observe that @xmath38 is diffeomorphic to @xmath39 by sending @xmath40 onto @xmath41 .",
    "to finish the proof , one needs to show that the map from the last diagram @xmath42 and the map @xmath43 are cobordant .",
    "this is done by a homotopy joining @xmath44 and its projection onto the zero section .",
    "\\1 . the proof of the homological thom isomorphism follows a similar pattern .",
    "let @xmath19 \\in h_q ( de , se)$ ] . consider the pull back diagram @xmath45 this gives the cycle @xmath46 representing a class in @xmath47 .",
    "our geometric approach to the homological thom isomorphism is valid in a more general setting : let @xmath50 be a vector bundle in the paracompact category . for a class",
    "@xmath25 $ ] of @xmath51 we can perform the latter pull back , when we replace @xmath7 by the composition @xmath52 where the last arrow is the classifying map of the vector bundle .",
    "taking a smooth universal bundle @xmath53 we can make the composition @xmath54 smooth .",
    "moreover , the pull back is a smooth , finite dimensional manifold with boundary . in favorable cases it maps to @xmath24 .",
    "clearly , the thom class @xmath55 can also be viewed as a bivariant class @xmath56 \\in h^n ( e \\buildrel \\pi \\over { \\longrightarrow}x).\\ ] ] it is not hard to work out the appropriate version of the thom isomorphism theorem using the intersection product of geometric bivariant theories .",
