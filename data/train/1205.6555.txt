    "the study of correlated systems like transition - metal dichalcogenides  @xcite , cobaltates  @xcite , @xmath6  @xcite and its doped variant @xmath7  @xcite have attracted considerable attention recently as they exhibit a number of remarkable cooperative phenomena , like valence and metal insulator transition , charge and magnetic order , excitonic instability  @xcite and possible non - fermi liquid states  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested recently that these correlated systems may very well be described by an effective falicov - kimball model ( fkm ) on a triangular lattice  @xcite .",
    "these systems are geometrically frustrated .",
    "the frustration gives rise to a large degeneracy at low temperatures and competing ground states close by in energy .",
    "a consequence of this is a fairly complex ground state magnetic phase diagram  @xcite and the presence of soft local modes strongly coupled to the conduction electrons  @xcite .",
    "the usual fkm  @xcite was proposed to study the semiconductor - metal transition in @xmath8 and other correlated electron systems .",
    "the fkm considers only the kinetic energy of the itinerant electrons and the local coulomb interaction between the itinerant and localized electrons .",
    "the effective interactions in the fkm are mediated by the itinerant electrons  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the fk model can be used to model crystallization in the solids  @xcite .",
    "this model has been applied to different types of lattices ( bipartite / non - bipartite ) and in different dimensions .",
    "more results are available for the fkm on bipartite lattices  @xcite than on non - bipartite lattices .",
    "recently several new ground states were observed for an extended fkm on a triangular lattice where the effect of correlated hopping @xmath0 , was taken into account  @xcite .",
    "as we know fkm is applicable to the systems where both itinerant as well as localized electrons are present . in the following",
    ", we will denote itinerant electrons as @xmath9-electrons and localized electrons as @xmath10-electrons .",
    "the correlated hopping term is influenced by the number of localized electrons present on the neighboring sites as explained below .",
    "for example , in some rare earth compounds ( especially the mixed - valence compounds ) , the rare earth ions with two different ionic configurations @xmath11 and @xmath12 have different ionic radii .",
    "the ions with @xmath12 configuration have less screening of nuclear charge as compared to the ions with @xmath11 configuration .",
    "the @xmath9-orbitals in ions having @xmath12 configuration feel more attraction due to the nucleus and hence get contracted .",
    "this leads to increased localization of those orbitals .",
    "hence the @xmath9-orbital overlap between nearest neighbors depends on local @xmath10- electron occupation of neighboring ions , resulting in a correlated hopping of @xmath9-electrons .",
    "such a correlated hopping term also appears in the first principles calculation  @xcite of the tight binding hamiltonian and is usually neglected in hubbard type models for being smaller compared to the on - site term .",
    "its significance in superconductivity has been emphasized already  @xcite and in the context of fkm , it has been considered by several authors  @xcite using various approximations .",
    "we , therefore , extend the model to include a correlated hopping term in the hamiltonian for the itinerant electrons . @xmath13 here @xmath14 ) are , respectively , the creation and annihilation operators for @xmath9-electrons ( @xmath10-electrons ) at the site @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the chemical potential .",
    "the first term in eq.(@xmath17 ) is a measure of kinetic energy of @xmath9-electrons on a triangular lattice .",
    "the @xmath18 , if i and j are nearest neighboring sites and @xmath19 , otherwise .",
    "the second term represents the dispersionless energy level @xmath20 of @xmath10-electrons while the third term is the on - site coulomb repulsion between @xmath9- and @xmath10-electrons .",
    "the last term ( i.e. the correlated hopping term ) is an extension of the usual fkm as discussed above .",
    "a comprehensive study of the ground state phase diagram of spinless falicov- kimball model on a triangular lattice with correlated hopping at different commensurate fillings of localized electrons in @xmath21 plane is reported elsewhere  @xcite . with correlated hopping ( @xmath22 $ ] ) two different phases",
    "are observed at @xmath23-filling of localized electrons namely ( i ) regular and ( ii ) segregated phases for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . at @xmath27-filling of localized electrons ( i ) bounded ( ii ) axial striped and ( iii ) segregated phases for @xmath24 and ( i ) striped and ( ii ) segregated phases for @xmath28 are reported .",
    "some of these charge ordered phases are also observed experimentally in the above mentioned systems .",
    "now , question arises , what is the temperature stability of these phases and which type of the phase transition occurs from the low temperature ordered phase to the high temperature disordered phase . in this work , therefore , we study the half filled fkm in its spinless version for different range of interactions with correlated hopping @xmath0 , on a triangular lattice numerically and observe the stability of these phases and type of the phase transition at finite temperature .",
    "in the extended falicov - kimball hamiltonian ( 1 ) , hybridization between @xmath29 and @xmath30electrons is absent",
    ". therefore , the local @xmath10-electron occupation number @xmath31 commutes with h. the @xmath32 is a good quantum number taking values either @xmath17 or @xmath33 according to the site @xmath15 is occupied or unoccupied by f - electron .",
    "the gauge symmetry also implies  @xcite that interband excitonic averages of the type @xmath34 are identically zero at any finite temperature ( implying an absence of homogeneous mixed valence ) and the @xmath10-electron level remains dispersionless ( @xmath35 , for @xmath36 ) . following the local conservation of @xmath10-electron number",
    "the hamiltonian may be written as , @xmath37 where @xmath38+(u\\omega_{i}-\\mu ) \\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "we work at half - filling , i.e. , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are the total number of @xmath10- and @xmath9-electrons and @xmath41 is the number of sites . for a lattice of @xmath42 sites ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath43 is now an @xmath44 matrix for a fixed configuration @xmath45 .",
    "we set the value of @xmath46=1 for nearest neighboring sites i and j and zero , otherwise .",
    "we choose a particular value of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , and a configuration @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "choosing values for @xmath0 and @xmath4 , the eigenvalues @xmath51 of @xmath52 , are calculated by numerical diagonalization with the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "average value of the physical quantities is calculated by monte carlo sampling method .",
    "the details of the method is reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the partition function is written as @xmath53 where the trace is taken over the @xmath9-electrons , and @xmath54 .",
    "the trace is calculated from the eigenvalues @xmath55 of the matrix @xmath56 ( first term in @xmath43 ( eq.(2 ) ) .",
    "the partition function can , therefore , be recast in the form @xmath57})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the corresponding total internal energy is @xmath58}}+\\,n_{f}e_{f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the thermodynamic quantities are calculated by the averages with the statistical weights , @xmath59 of localized f - electron configurations @xmath45 , respectively .    in the simulations , one starts with random configuration ( of @xmath30electrons ) at high temperature and then the temperature is ramped down slowly until a stable ground state is obtained at very low temperature .",
    "then this ground state configuration is chosen as the initial configuration for a particular finite temperature .",
    "for a fixed finite temperature a large number of monte carlo steps are carried out to make the system reach the equilibrium .",
    "we have observed that around @xmath60 monte carlo steps are sufficient for this .",
    "then the ensemble average of the thermodynamic quantity of interest is calculated on next ( @xmath61 ) monte carlo steps .",
    "now an important question arises whether the system has reached equilibrium or not . to ensure this we rerun the simulation starting from two different initial configurations ; firstly from a fully ordered configuration of @xmath30electrons and secondly from random configuration of @xmath30 electrons . after a certain number of monte carlo steps ( around 1000 steps ) the internal energies for",
    "both the cases approach same value .",
    "this implies that the system has reached equilibrium .",
    "a similar approach was earlier employed in the study of phase transitions in fkm on a square lattice  @xcite .    in order to determine the type of phase transition , we have calculated temperature dependence of the charge susceptibility @xmath3 and the specific heat @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath2 are calculated by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) .",
    "the @xmath3 is related through the fdt to the first order variance of the density - density correlation function  @xcite , given as , @xmath63 where @xmath64 represent average over different configurations .",
    "the @xmath65 is the density - density correlation function defined as , @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the unitary vectors along the x and y directions respectively ( here we assumed lattice constant as unity ) .",
    "the specific heat ( @xmath2 ) is related through the fdt to the internal energy and defined as , @xmath70    the specific heat and charge susceptibility are calculated by different approaches .",
    "the specific heat is calculated from eigenvalues of the @xmath29electron hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath29electron spectrum changes with temperature .",
    "correspondingly total internal energy of @xmath29electrons changes with temperature .",
    "this change in total internal energy of the system with temperature is nothing but temperature dependence of the specific heat .",
    "it has been seen that in a particular temperature range a few eigenvalues in the lower part of @xmath29band increase with increase in temperature ( while other eigenvalues are remaining unaffected ) .",
    "this manifest in the increase of @xmath29electron specific heat around that temperature .",
    "the charge susceptibility is calculated from density - density correlation function ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the @xmath71 depends on @xmath30electron configuration only .",
    "in addition , we have calculated the thermal average ( or the ensemble average ) of the @xmath30electron occupation ( @xmath72 ) on each site ( @xmath73 ) and probability energy distribution at a temperature t ( p(e , t ) or simply p(e ) ) .",
    "the @xmath72 on each site ( i ) is given as , @xmath74 where , summation is taken over the different monte carlo simulation steps at a finite temperature .",
    "we have chosen a random configuration of @xmath30electrons initially . at @xmath75",
    "an ordered ground state configuration of @xmath30 electrons is obtained . at a finite temperature @xmath76 ,",
    "this ordered configuration is chosen as initial configuration .",
    "the ensemble average of the @xmath30electron occupation , @xmath72 , is calculated for @xmath61 monte carlo steps , after the system reached equilibrium .",
    "p(e ) is defined as the probability of energy @xmath77 occurring at temperature t in the monte - carlo simulation  @xcite .",
    "it is equal to the thermal average of the density of states : @xmath78 where n(e ) is the density of states for energy @xmath77 ( the number of configurations with energy @xmath77 ) and @xmath76 is the temperature of the simulation .",
    "at finite temperature , only few exact calculation results are available on the bipartite ( square ) lattice without  @xcite and with  @xcite correlated hopping . without correlated hopping ( usual fkm ) and for half - filled case",
    ", they observed that for all finite coulomb correlation @xmath79 the ground state configuration is checkerboard type that persist up to a critical temperature @xmath80 . at @xmath81",
    "the system undergoes a phase transition to the homogeneous phase .",
    "the phase transition is of first order for @xmath82 and of second order for @xmath83  @xcite . with correlated hopping @xmath0 and @xmath84",
    ", low temperature phase is an ordered phase and mainly type of checkerboard , axial striped and segregated phase . for @xmath84 , and for @xmath85",
    "the phase transition is of the first order and for @xmath86 , phase transition is of the second order . in the regime of @xmath0 , where phase is of the checkerboard type critical temperature reduces with increasing @xmath0 and in the regime where phase is of the type of axial striped and segregated , the critical temperature enhanced with increase in the @xmath0 .",
    "perturbative results for large @xmath4 indicate that to order @xmath87 , the fkm can be mapped onto an ising antiferromagnet ( afm ) in a magnetic field , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 .",
    "the ising afm state on a triangular lattice is frustrated and leads to large degeneracies at low temperature .",
    "it turns out that this frustration is lifted  @xcite in higher order perturbation in @xmath87 .",
    "it is therefore quite intriguing that one would expect the effects of frustration to bear on the finite temperature states as on - site coulomb correlation ( @xmath4 ) between @xmath29 and @xmath30 electrons and the chemical potential ( @xmath16 ) are varied .",
    "there is hardly any exact result for the fkm on the non - bipartite lattice at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is quite interesting to observe the temperature induced phase transitions in the fkm on a triangular lattice .",
    "we have studied the finite temperature induced phase transitions as a function of a range of values of @xmath4 and fillings ( i ) @xmath90 and ( ii ) @xmath91(@xmath92 is constrained to @xmath93 ) of @xmath30electrons using the method outlined in the previous section .",

    "<S> a numerical diagonalization technique with canonical monte - carlo algorithm is used to study the phase transitions from low temperature ( ordered ) phase to high temperature ( disordered ) phase of spinless falicov - kimball model on a triangular lattice with correlated hopping ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the low temperature phases ( i.e. regular , bounded , striped and segregated ) persist up to a finite critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we observe that the critical temperature decreases with increasing the correlated hopping in regular , striped and bounded phases whereas it increases in the segregated phase . single and multi peak patterns seen in the temperature dependence of specific heat ( @xmath2 ) and charge susceptibility ( @xmath3 ) for different values of parameters like on - site coulomb correlation strength ( @xmath4 ) , correlated hopping ( @xmath0 ) and filling of localized electrons ( @xmath5 ) are also discussed . </S>"
