    "galaxies are thought to form out of gas which cools and collapses to the centres of these dark matter haloes ( e.g. white & rees 1978 ) . in this picture",
    "the properties of galaxies are expected to be strongly related to the properties of the dark matter haloes in which they are embedded ( e.g. mo , mao & white 1998 , dutton et al .",

    "it has been shown by several studies that the structural properties of dark matter ( dm ) haloes are dependent on halo mass : for example higher mass haloes are less concentrated ( navarro , frank & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ; eke et al .  2001 ;",

    "the situation is less clear for the spin parameter , at @xmath5 there seems to be no mass dependence ( macci et al .  2007 ; m08 ) or at least a very weak one ( bett et al .",
    "2007 ) , while for increasing values of the redshift a possible mild correlation between spin and mass seems to arise ( knebe & power 2008 ) .    in m08 the properties of dm haloes were studied in universes whose parameters were fixed by the one , three and five - year release of the wmap mission ( wmap5 ; komatsu et al .",
    "in that study the attention has been focused on the structural parameters of virialized haloes and their correlations at the present epoch , @xmath5 . in this work",
    "we extend this previous analysis to higher redshifts and study how the scaling relations of dm haloes change with time .    as in m08",
    "we use a large suite of n - body simulations in a wmap5 cosmology with different box sizes to cover the entire halo mass range relevant for galaxy formation : from @xmath6 ( haloes that host dwarf galaxies ) to @xmath7 ( massive clusters ) .",
    "we use these simulations to investigate the evolution of concentrations , spin parameter and shapes of dark matter haloes through cosmic time .",
    "similar studies have been already conducted in the past , mainly using lower numerical resolution and/or a smaller mass range ( but with few recent exceptions ) .",
    "navarro , frank & white ( 1997 ) proposed that the characteristic density of dark matter haloes was directly proportional to the density of the universe at time of formation , making possible to connect today properties of the dark matter density profile to the halo formation history and to the evolution of the expanding universe .",
    "this idea was then expanded by wechsler et al .",

    "zhao s main result was the finding of a correlation between @xmath8 and the characteristic mass of dark matter haloes , @xmath9 , defined as the mass inside @xmath8 .",
    "thanks to this correlation they were able to model the time evolution of the concentration parameter in a cosmology - free fashion .",
    "a comparison of the different approaches to predict dark matter halo concentrations was performed by neto et al .",

    "neto et al .  ( 2007 ) found that although these models could match the average concentration reasonably well , they performed very poorly in many cases , because their models for halo mass evolution were not able to satisfactorily reproduce `` real '' mass growth histories from n - body simulations .",
    "however , the evolution of dark matter halo properties does not reduce to the concentration parameter only ; halo shape and spin parameter are also important quantities that could influence the properties of the hosted galaxy .",

    "we determine a set of parameters , including the virial mass and radius , the concentration parameter , the angular momentum , the spin parameter and axis ratios ( shape ) .",

    "a more detailed discussion can be found in macci et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) .      to compute the concentration of a halo",
    "we first determine its density profile .",
    "the halo centre is defined as the location of the most bound halo particle ( we define the most bound particle as the particle with the lowest potential energy , no care about binding energy is taken here ) , and we compute the density ( @xmath32 ) in 50 spherical shells , spaced equally in logarithmic radius .",
    "errors on the density are computed from the poisson noise due to the finite number of particles in each mass shell .",
    "the resulting density profile is fitted with a nfw profile :    @xmath33    during the fitting procedure we treat both @xmath8 and @xmath34 as free parameters .",
    "their values , and associated uncertainties , are obtained via a @xmath35 minimization procedure using the levenberg & marquardt method .",
    "we define the r.m.s . of the fit as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the fitted nfw density distribution .. nevertheless we keep the use of @xmath38 to be consistent with the notation used in macci et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) ] finally , we define the concentration of the halo , @xmath39 , using the virial radius obtained from the so algorithm , and we define the error on @xmath40 as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the fitting uncertainty on @xmath8 .",
    "the spin parameter is a dimensionless measure of the amount of rotation of a dark matter halo .",
    "we use the definition introduced by bullock et al .",
    "( 2001b ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mass interior to @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the total angular momentum of that mass distribution and @xmath47 is its circular velocity at the virial radius .",
    "see macci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for a detailed discussion and for a comparison of the different definitions of the spin parameter .      determining the shape of a three - dimensional distribution of particles is a non - trivial task ( e.g. , jing & suto 2002 ) .",
    "following allgood et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we determine the shapes of our haloes starting from the inertia tensor . as a first step ,",
    "we compute the halo s @xmath48 inertia tensor using all the particles within the virial radius .",
    "next , we diagonalize the inertia tensor and rotate the particle distribution according to the eigenvectors . in this new frame (",
    "in which the moment of inertia tensor is diagonal ) the ratios @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 ) are given by : @xmath52    next we again compute the inertia tensor , but this time only using the particles inside the ellipsoid defined by @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "when deforming the ellipsoidal volume of the halo , we keep the longest axis ( @xmath53 ) equal to the original radius of the spherical volume ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we iterate this procedure until we converge to a stable set of axis ratios .",
    "although this iterative procedure can indeed change the mass contained inside of the ellipsoid , we checked that variations are nevertheless below 20% .",
    "we will therefore not consider those changes in mass when showing mass - shape relations , and we will work always with virial masses .",
    "our halo finder ( and halo finders in general ) does not distinguish between relaxed and unrelaxed haloes .",
    "there are many reasons why we might want to remove unrelaxed haloes .",
    "first and foremost , unrelaxed haloes often have poorly defined centers , which makes the determination of a radial density profile , and hence of the concentration parameter , an ill - defined problem .",
    "moreover unrelaxed haloes often have shapes that are not adequately described by an ellipsoid , making our shape parameters ill - defined as well .",
    "following macci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we decide to use a combination of two different parameters @xmath38 and @xmath56 to determine the dynamical status of a given dark matter halo .",
    "the first quantity @xmath38 is defined as the r.m.s . of the nfw fit to the density profile ( performed to compute @xmath57 ) . while it is true that @xmath38 is typically high for unrelaxed haloes , haloes with relatively few particles also have a high @xmath38 ( due to poisson noise ) even when they are relaxed ; furthermore , since the spherical averaging used to compute the density profiles has a smoothing effect , not all unrelaxed haloes have a high @xmath38 . in order to circumvent these problems ,",
    "we combine the value of @xmath38 with the @xmath56 parameter , defined as the distance between the most bound particle ( used as the center for the density profile ) and the center of mass of the halo , in units of the virial radius .",
    "this offset is a measure for the extent to which the halo is relaxed : relaxed haloes in equilibrium will have a smooth , radially symmetric density distribution , and thus an offset that is virtually equal to zero .",
    "unrelaxed haloes , such as those that have only recently experienced a major merger , are likely to reveal a strongly asymmetric mass distribution , and thus a relatively large @xmath56 .",
    "although some unrelaxed haloes may have a small @xmath56 , the advantage of this parameter over , for example , the actual virial ratio , @xmath58 , as a function of radius ( e.g. macci , murante & bonometto 2003 ) , is that the former is trivial to evaluate .",
    "following macci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we split our halo sample into unrelaxed and relaxed haloes .",
    "the latter are defined as the haloes with @xmath59 and @xmath60 . about 70% of the haloes in our sample qualify as relaxed haloes at @xmath5 .    to check for the effect of changing the definition of relaxed haloes ,",
    "we have computed the median concentration ( as shown in the next section ) using different values of @xmath56 .",
    "changing the value of this parameter by 25% ( above and below 0.07 ) induces changes no larger than 5% in the median concentration of dark matter haloes .",
    "we conclude that choosing @xmath61 our results are robust enough against variations in the definition of relaxed population of haloes . in",
    "what follows we will just present results for haloes which qualify as relaxed .",
    "in figure [ fig : cwithfit ] we show the median @xmath3  relation for relaxed haloes in our sample at different redshifts .",
    "haloes have been binned in mass bins of 0.4 dex width , the median concentration in each bin has been computed taking into account the error associated to the concentration value ( see [ ssec : c ] , and m08 ) . in our",
    "mass range the @xmath3  relation is well fitted by a single power law at almost all redshifts . only for @xmath4",
    "we see an indication that the linearity of the relation in log space seems to break , in agreement with recent findings by klypin et al .",

    "the evolution of @xmath12 and @xmath65 can be itself fitted with two simple formulas that allow to reconstruct the @xmath3  relation at any redshifts : @xmath66 @xmath67    where the additional ( constant ) fitting parameters have been set equal to : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ fig : creconst ] shows the reconstruction of the @xmath3  relation for different mass bins as a function of redshift using the approach described above .",
    "it shows that our ( double ) fitting formulas are able to recover the original values of the halo concentration with a precision of 5% , for the whole range of masses and redshifts inspected .",
    "it has been shown by trenti et al .",
    "( 2010 ) that using @xmath73 between 100 and 400 particles is enough to get good estimates for the properties of halos , nevertheless in order to look for systematics we re - computed @xmath74 varying the minimum number of particle inside @xmath75 , using 200 , 500 and 1000 particles .",
    "no appreciable differences ( less than 2% ) were found in our results for the median .",

    "two of these ( b30 and b90 ) increase the statistics of our halo catalogs at the low mass end , providing a better determination of the @xmath3  relation for @xmath81 .",

    "2009 ) we need to construct merger trees for haloes in our simulation boxes . here",
    "we briefly describe the procedure used to build merger trees ( for more details see neistein , macci & dekel 2010 ) .",
    "we link haloes @xmath82 and @xmath83 , with particle number @xmath84 and @xmath85 , in two consecutive snapshots at redshift @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , if they success to satisfy a list of requirements :    * if @xmath89 , they have at least @xmath90 particles in common * if @xmath91 , they have at least @xmath92 particles in common * halo @xmath83 does not contribute to any other halo in @xmath86 with more particles than it does for halo @xmath82    we will assume that the evolution of the structural properties of the halo is traced by the most massive progenitor , therefore we will present results only for the main branch of the tree .",
    "we follow along the tree the evolution of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath8 and @xmath74 .",
    "since individual histories of haloes can be very different we focus our study on the time evolution of the mean value of these quantities .",
    "these averages are computed binning the histories by mass at @xmath5 with each mass bin having width of 0.4 dex .",
    "one may argue that following only the merger tree main branch of haloes indentified at z=0 could introduce a bias when comparing to the evolution of haloes at earlier cosmic times . in order to verify the stability of our results we rebuilt the merger histories for all haloes starting from z=0.5 and z=1.0 ( i.e. without taking into account the future evolution of an halo , like , for example , being or not in the final catalogue at z=0 ) .",
    "we found no differences in the evolution of the mean values for @xmath45 or @xmath44 with respect to the original merger tree built from z=0 .",
    "for the averages we include only histories with the same length , that is , histories that in the entire box evolve from the same @xmath93 to @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath94 was chosen by numerical - statistic reasons . as we are computing the mean on several properties of haloes in the merger histories along the time",
    ", we wanted to make sure to have at each redshift a statistically meaningful number of histories .",
    "the extension in redshift is then constrained by the resolution of our simulation and the number of histories we choose for our study . at the end we found @xmath95 to be a good compromise .",
    "moreover we only use histories in which the fitting of the density profile was successful in the majority of the snapshots .",
    "any halo was allowed to be `` unrelaxed '' for a maximum of 2 consecutive snapshots . in this case",
    ", we used as criterion for the goodness of the density profile fit @xmath96 .",
    "using both our criteria of relaxation ( @xmath97 and @xmath56 ) the number of histories becomes too small to be statistically meaningful . to be able to follow the histories longer in redshift we reduced the minimum number of particles per halo ( inside the virial radius ) from 500 ( as used in the previous section ) to 200 .",
    "we verified that using 200 particles inside the virial radius the fitting of the density profile is still acceptable for the purposes of this section .    finally ,",
    "since we are constraining the mass histories in redshift extent , we can not overlap data among different boxes , then we have computed average quantities for individual boxes independently . in the following",
    "we will present results coming from the b90 box , other boxes show very similar behaviours . applying all of this selection criteria on b90 results in a set of 2300 histories with the different mass bins having between 35 and 800 halos each .    in figure",

    "it is now possible to interpret the evolution of the @xmath3  relation in the light of our findings .",
    "figure [ fig : creconst ] shows that the growth rate of the concentration depends on the halo mass , with low mass haloes experiencing a faster concentration evolution .",
    "moreover , at fixed mass , the evolution of the @xmath3  relation is faster at lower redshifts .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : rvir ] , at early times @xmath8 grows simultaneously with @xmath45 , then , with decreasing redshift , the growth of @xmath8 slows down , reaches a maximum , and starts to decrease .",
    "when @xmath45 grows together with @xmath8 , the concentration of the halo stays approximately constant or slightly increases .",
    "then when @xmath8 slows down its growth rate and starts to `` contract '' the concentration of the halo grows rapidly . in the case of high mass haloes the time at which the dynamics of the inner region decouples from the outermost part , happens at later times compared to low mass haloes . as a consequence",
    "more massive haloes have a more extended period in which the concentration is a slowly growing function of time as shown in figure [ fig : creconst ] . only in recent cosmic times , due to the late collapse of the inner part the concentration starts to grow at a higher rate also for larger masses .    a crucial point in this process",
    "is the moment when the inner part of the halo decouples from the outer one .",
    "this specific time is strongly mass dependent with smaller structures ( i.e. the more non linear ones ) decoupling earlier .",
    "this effect explains the change in the slope of the @xmath3  relation , as described in figure [ fig : cparams ] by the evolution of @xmath63 , and also explains why a simple scaling of the redshift zero @xmath3  relation with a factor of the form @xmath127 ( e.g. bullock et al .",
    "2001a ) is not able to reproduce the simulated data .",
    "we now turn our attention to the evolution of halo shape with redshift and its dependence on halo mass . as was described in section [ sec : defshapes ] , for each dark matter halo we compute the axis ratios @xmath128 and @xmath129 , where @xmath51 are the major , intermediate and minor axis of the halo mass distribution .",
    "it is worth to note that in our notation using only @xmath130 and @xmath131 is enough to determine the shape of a dark matter halo .",
    "the condition for a halo to be oblate will be @xmath132 , while the condition to be prolate will be @xmath133 with @xmath134 , where the obvious condition for sphericity is @xmath135 and triaxiality will be any other not filling any of the previous requirements .",
    "figure [ baz ] shows the evolution of the shape parameter @xmath130 as a function of redshift and mass .",
    "figure [ caz ] is the analogue of figure [ baz ] but for the @xmath131 parameter , only results for haloes with @xmath136 are shown ; after several convergence tests we found that this number ensures both numerical stability of the axis determination and a fairly large statistical sample .",
    "both figures show that on average halos are preferentially triaxial , where the most massive haloes tend to be the most ellipsoidal ones , while lower mass haloes tend to be closer to spherical , and this trend seems to be redshift independent .",

    "( 2010 ) . when compared with the model proposed in zhao et al .",
    "( 2009 ) our results show a very good agreement at the low mass end ( possibly due to the fact that both halo samples have more or less the same level of resolution ) . for high masses",
    "we find a slightly higher difference but never exceeding few percent .",
    "the comparison with klypin et al .",
    "is less straightforward since they used a different method to compute concentrations , based on the circular velocity of the halo instead of directly fitting the density profile .",

    "our results are in qualitative agreement with the model proposed by klypin et al .  for the evolution of the @xmath3  relation",
    "but there are differences of the order of 8% .",
    "it is then interesting to ask ourselves if these differences arise from the different method used to compute @xmath74 .    for this purpose we applied to our b90 box ( which has roughly the same resolution as the bolshoi simulation of klypin et al .",
    "2010 ) the method proposed by klypin to compute the concentration , based on the relation between mass and maximum circular velocity . to be consistent with klypin et al .",
    "2010 we considered all haloes in our sample , without making any distinction between relaxed and unrelaxed .",
    "we find that the different methods to compute @xmath164 do not introduce any systematic bias , being perfectly consistent .",
    "nevertheless we found that at fixed mass our haloes have a lower circular velocity compared to the klypin et al .",
    "( 2010 ) results . taking into account the explicit dependence of the concentration on @xmath165 we are keen to conclude that part of the difference in @xmath3",
    "relation could be due the slightly different values of the cosmological parameters and primordial power spectral index .",
    "another interesting result regards the effect of including unrelaxed haloes .",
    "klypin et al .",
    "( 2010 ) did not make any attempts of removing unrelaxed haloes ; this is in principle justified because their concentrations are obtained from an integral quantity ( @xmath166 ) which is less affected by the dynamical status of the halo with respect to a differential one like @xmath167 . on the other hand by applying klypin s method to our b90 box we found that the @xmath168 relation has a systematic shift ( @xmath169 ) towards higher values when it is computed for `` relaxed '' haloes instead than for all haloes .",
    "this results in a systematic bias , towards lower concentrations , for the \" all  sample with respect to the relaxed one .",
    "finally zhao et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and klypin et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that the concentration may have a minimum value close to 3.5 - 4.5 at redshift close to 4 .",
    "unfortunately our simulations do not have enough resolution to get a statistical valid halo sample at such a high redshift , so we can not confirm such a finding , even if we do see some evidence of a breaking of a simple power law behaviour for the @xmath3  relation at @xmath4 .",
    "let us stress one more time that the fitting formula we proposed in this work are valid only in the test redshift range [ 0 - 2 ] and should not be extrapolated at higher redshifts .    in order to improve our understanding on the redshift evolution of the @xmath3  relation",
    "we look at the individual evolution with time of @xmath8 and @xmath45 .",
    "both these length scales grow with decreasing redshift until a maximum is reached , then they start to decrease towards @xmath5 .",
    "there is a clear analogy between the collapse of a linear perturbation and the behaviour of @xmath8 and @xmath45 .",
    "we found that we can model the evolution of the inner part of the halo ( within @xmath8 ) as a decoupled spherical perturbation growing inside the central region of the halo .",
    "the temporal offset between the `` turning points '' of the perturbations associated with @xmath8 and @xmath45 is able to explain the observed redshift evolution of the @xmath3  relation ; which strongly deviates from a simple @xmath127 scaling of the @xmath5 relation . as a final remark we would like to stress that our results refer to the dark matter distrubution in the absence of a collisional component .",
    "although it has been shown that the inclusion of baryonic physics may affect the properties of the dark matter , it also known that the strength of this effect strongly depends on the implemented baryonic physics ( duffy et al .",
    "2010 , governato et al .",
    "the dark matter distribution in real haloes is still under debate and a comparison of pure dark matter results with observations should be preformed with extreme caution .",
    "we then investigate the mass and redshift dependence of the axis ratio ( @xmath131 and @xmath130 ) of dark matter haloes .",
    "our results are in agreement with previous studies and show that although on average haloes in our simulations are preferentially triaxial at all masses and redshifts , low mass haloes are more spherical than high mass ones and , at any mass , central regions are more aspherical than outer ones .",
    "we find a more complex evolution of the shape - mass relation with redshift with respect to the model proposed by allgood et al .",
    "we propose a new fitting function ( that deviates from a simple power law ) that is able to reproduce our data in the whole redshift and mass range .",
    "finally we studied the evolution of the spin parameter @xmath147 .",
    "at redshift zero we confirm the results of macci et al .",
    "( 2007 ; 2008 ) , who found the spin parameter to be mass independent . for increasing redshift",
    "there is evidence of a correlation between halo mass and spin : on average , more massive haloes have lower values of the spin parameter .",
    "this is in agreement with recent findings at very high redshift ( @xmath151 ) by knebe & power ( 2008 ) . as already speculated by those authors , since disk sizes are to first order proportional to the spin parameter ( mo et al .",
    "1998 ) , a lower spin parameter for high mass haloes could make their central stellar and gaseous body more compact and hence allowing more efficient star formation .",
    "in addition this could affect the evolution of the size - mass relation of galaxy disks , which is usually modeled by assuming @xmath170 is independent of mass and redshift ( mao , mo & white 1998 ; somerville et al .",
    "2008 ; firmani & avila - reese 2009 ; dutton et al .  2010 ) .",
    "however , in our simulations the differences in median spin parameters at @xmath4 compared to @xmath5 are at most 15% , and thus the consequences to observables such as the size - mass relation of disk galaxies are likely to be small .",
    "furthermore , baryonic effects such as supernova driven outflows and inefficient cooling can modify spin parameters by much larger amounts ( factors of @xmath171 ) ( dutton & van den bosch 2009 ) .",
    "thus it is unlikely that the mass dependence on halo spin that we observe in our simulations at @xmath4 will have an unambiguous observational signature .",
