    "with the new experimental data from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) one will be able to scrutinise the standard model ( sm ) boundaries with unprecedented precision .",
    "flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) top decays such as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are highly suppressed in the sm due to the well known glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "top - quark fcnc branching ratios are of the order of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the electroweak and strong case respectively .",
    "however , some versions of two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) predict quite larger values .",
    "in fact , for some regions of the 2hdm parameter space the br(@xmath5 ) could reach values of the order of @xmath6  @xcite , which is eight orders of magnitude above the sm value .",
    "the high statistics expected in lhc data forces an increase in the precision of all relevant theoretical calculations .",
    "hence , at least next - to - leading ( nlo ) calculations should be made available whenever possible .",
    "the experimental searches performed both at lhc and at the tevatron on the direct top fcnc process have already used nlo cross sections from  @xcite .",
    "however , the nlo calculation was used only as a normalization factor and the events were generated using lo generators like toprex  @xcite or protos  @xcite . in this work we present a new monte carlo tool that generates fcnc direct top events with nlo precision .",
    "the fcnc interactions were implemented via an effective lagrangian  @xcite where a complete set of dimension six operators was used .",
    "the events are generated in the les - houches event ( lhe ) format  @xcite and can therefore be easily interfaced with shower algorithms such as the one in pythia  @xcite . since the generator calculates the total inclusive cross section , the fcnc single top process was also included and can be generated independently .",
    "not only strong fcnc interactions , but also electroweak and four - fermions dimensions six operators were included . each operator can be turned on independently allowing for independent studies of the different lorentz structures . in section  [ sec : effective ] the effective formalism is presented while in section  [ sec : processes ] we show the physical processes already included in metop . in section  [ sec : nlo ] we give a description of the algorithm used by the monte carlo generator in order to obtain a final nlo result . in section  [ results ]",
    "we discuss a few selected results and in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we sum up our conclusions .",
    "in the effective lagrangian formalism we assume that the sm is no more than a low energy limit of some more general theory to be revealed at tev scale . in this context",
    ", the top - quark fcnc interaction is seen at low energies as a contact interaction that can be parametrized with higher dimension effective operators .",
    "the complete lagrangian is written as @xmath7 where we have truncated the expansion series at dimension @xmath8 .",
    "we follow the formalism in  @xcite , where the sm symmetries are imposed and all operators are built using the already known sm fields .",
    "this results in a reduced list of the possible dimension six operators .",
    "additionally , baryon and lepton number conservation is imposed , which restricts the operators to dimension six only . even imposing the sm symmetries ,",
    "the number of all possible fcnc operators is quite vast .",
    "however , the list can be reduced by using appropriate equations of motion and fierz transformations applied to the physical operators we are dealing with .",
    "the final minimal complete set of fcnc operators for top - quark physics was obtained in  @xcite . with this procedure , a single operator survives in the strong sector  @xcite . following the notation in  @xcite this operator",
    "can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gluonic field tensor , @xmath11 right - handed @xmath12 or @xmath13-quark field and @xmath14 is the left - handed quark doublet .",
    "the same operator also appears in the literature as a dimension 5 operator @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a real parameter , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are complex numbers which respect @xmath21 .",
    "this operator is responsible for the effective fcnc vertices @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the minimum set of operators in the electroweak sector is @xmath24 + @xmath25 + @xmath26 + @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the @xmath30 and @xmath31 field tensors , respectively .",
    "the field @xmath32 is the usual higgs boson doublet .",
    "in addition to this electroweak set of operators , we have included subsets of four - fermion operators which are described in  @xcite .",
    "the physical processes included in metop are fcnc direct top production and fcnc single top production .",
    "direct top is available both at lo and at nlo while fcnc single top is availble only at lo .",
    "all processes can be generated for both @xmath33 and @xmath34 hadron colliders .",
    "furthermore , the full top decay chain is included so that spin correlations are preserved .",
    "also , in order to perform spin correlations studies , a on / off switch for the top decay chain was made available . in figures  [ fig : dtop ] and  [ fig : lqtop ] we show the generic feynman diagrams for the physical processes implemented in metop .",
    "the production process depicted in figure  [ fig : dtop ] has only strong fcnc operator contributions . born level fcnc direct top is shown in figure  [ fig : dtop ] ( left ) together with the @xmath35 process ( right ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : lqtop ] we present the diagrams for the lo @xmath36 production process from gluon fusion ( right ) and with quarks in the initial state ( left ) .",
    "the former is only affected by strong fcnc operators while the later has contributions from the strong , electroweak and four - fermion sectors .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , metop is able to generate fcnc direct top events with nlo precision .",
    "the implementation was performed by adopting an nlo effective approximation  @xcite . a general nlo calculation of an n - particles final state process",
    "can be represented by @xmath37 where @xmath38 stands for born , @xmath39 for virtual and @xmath40 for real .",
    "it is well known that the virtual term has infrared divergences that will only be cured by the inclusion of the real radiation term @xmath41 .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : dtopnlo ] the class of diagrams contributing to nlo direct top production .",
    "the first process @xmath42 correspond to the born term .",
    "the second , @xmath42 , corresponds to the virtual term while the third , @xmath43 , is the real radiation term .",
    "this last term gives rise to an infrared divergence which correspond to a low @xmath44 and/or to a collinear external gluon .",
    "kinematically , the divergence can be parametrized by the gluon transverse momentum , @xmath44 , and it obviously occurs in the limit @xmath45 . in order to avoid the divergence one could just impose a @xmath44 cut .",
    "the resulting region has to be excluded from the event space generation with some care - since the problem arises only in the collinear / soft limit , we can fill this phase space region with a branching mechanism . by doing so",
    ", we assume a collinear factorization , where the qcd radiation is emitted by one of the external legs of the born configuration .",
    "this approximation can be translated by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the real radiation for ( @xmath35 ) and direct top amplitudes , respectively ; @xmath49 is the phase space for the @xmath50th body processes and @xmath51 is the altarelli - parisi splitting function .",
    "the variable @xmath52 is a resolution parameter which in our case is the top quark transverse momentum @xmath53 .",
    "the hard @xmath44 region will then be filled by using the appropriate transition amplitude and the low @xmath44 region by the use of a shower mechanism . in this nlo effective approximation",
    "@xcite , the @xmath44 phase - space is then divided in two regions parametrized by @xmath53 , which we call @xmath54 .",
    "this parameter plays the role of a matching parameter where the criterion for a good transition is the smoothness of the final @xmath44 distribution .",
    "the final cross section free of divergences can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the transverse momentum of the parton shower emission .",
    "the contribution from the virtual term @xmath57 in equation  [ eqn : sigmanlo ] is included via a k - factor applied to the born term and because born and virtual terms share the same @xmath58 topology we assume they have similar kinematics .",
    "it is from equation  [ eqn : kfactor ] that events in metop are generated . since metop is a parton level generator , the events must then be submitted to a parton shower simulator in order to include initial ( isr ) and final ( fsr ) state radiation .",
    "therefore , since these parton showers are based on a branching mechanism , we leave the collinear and/or soft @xmath44 phase space region to be filled by the corresponding parton shower . in order to avoid double counting",
    "we just have to ensure that the parton shower will not populate the @xmath59 region in the first emission . to prevent it ,",
    "the shower mechanism must be performed with the pt - ordered scheme with the first emission starting at @xmath60 . for the nlo direct top process",
    ", metop assumes that the pythia shower will be used with its pt - ordered scheme  @xcite flag on .",
    "finally , we note that because this is a @xmath58 process , the shower mechanism implemented in pythia will not add fsr but only isr .",
    "this does not pose any problems because fsr is negligible when compared to isr due the large top - quark mass .",
    "in figure 4 we show the diagram flow of the metop generation process .",
    "it was drawn specifically for the nlo direct top case .",
    "the remaining processes follow the same flow except for the k - factor calculation step .",
    "the amplitudes used to evaluate the cross sections were generated with calchep  @xcite , whit feynman rules derived with lanhep @xcite and all integrations were performed using the cuba library  @xcite .",
    "the k - factors are calculated `` on the fly '' and therefore each sub process has its own normalization factor .",

    "the blue dashed line represents the top @xmath44 distribution of the real radiation process .",
    "as explained before , both regions overlap and therefore a matching must be introduced in order to avoid double counting .",
    "the matching process must be chosen so that the transition between the rescaled direct top distribution and the real radiation process is smooth . in figure",
    "[ fig : ptmatch510 ] we show the top @xmath44 distribution for @xmath62 gev where direct top is the gray dashed line and @xmath35 is the blue dashed line .",

    "we have studied several @xmath54 scenarios in the 5 gev to 20 gev range finding no significant differences .",

    "it is clear that in both distributions the final nlo result does not amount to simply multiplying the lo result by a k - factor .",
