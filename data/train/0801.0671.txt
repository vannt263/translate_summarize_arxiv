    "the last finding leads us to the conclusion that previous arguments made against the presence of alfvn waves in the tr , based on the apparent isotropy of the line width variation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we analyze full disk spectroheliograms in emission lines of ( 1548.20 , @xmath1 ) and ( 770.42 , @xmath2 ) acquired by sumer in february 1996 .",
    "the slit dimensions , step sizes and exposure times of each of these raster scans are documented in table  1 of @xcite .",
    "the data are reduced following the main sumer data reduction procedure .",

    "each pixel in the spectral image then has a line ( peak ) intensity , position and @xmath4 width @xmath5 ( measured in spectral pixel units ) .",

    "figure  f1 shows maps of the line peak intensities ( top ) and line width ( bottom ) from the ga fits for the sumer spectra of and .",
    "the map shows that the @xmath13 values are often enhanced by @xmath1810km / s around network ( nw ) locations compared to internetwork ( in ) areas ( note that some internetwork locations do not have sufficient counts to reliably fit a gaussian to the spectra ) , an effect noted by @xcite among others .",
    "we also note that the non - thermal line broadening increases towards the limb for and . also , the values of @xmath13 are enhanced ( significantly ) in polar coronal holes and ( moderately ) in the darker regions of the spectroheliograms on the disk that are possibly the locations of equatorial coronal holes ( ech ) .",
    "unfortunately , the poor spatial resolution and raster stepping of the spectroheliograms significantly limits the analysis of this interesting correspondence , leaving further investigation for more detailed sumer measurements of ech regions ( like that discussed by * ? ? ?",
    "figure  f3 provides a detailed look at the center - to - limb ( cl ) and center - to - pole ( cp ) variation of the radially averaged line widths ( top ) and intensities ( bottom ) in both spectral lines for 200 wide swathes through disk center . in each case",
    "the line widths vary slowly from disk center to about a radial position of 0.9r@xmath19 ( or 0.8r@xmath19 in the cp variation because of the polar coronal holes ) . beyond 0.8 - 0.9r@xmath19 a dramatic increase of 5 - 10km / s in the line widths is visible , peaking around the limb and then dropping off to disk center values by about 10 above the limb ( noted by * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the growth of the line widths in is amplified in polar coronal holes ( also noted by * ? ? ? * ) and that the line width enhancements in the supergranular network ( visible in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) is reduced by the significant spatial averaging ( cf . the narrow data slice shown in fig .",
    "the line width largely follows the pattern of up to about 0.9r@xmath19 , but at the limb it shows a completely different variation . while the intensities peak somewhat above the limb ( @xmath181.03r@xmath19 ) the line widths appear to increase very gradually beyond that point , extending some 40 above the limb as is evident from close inspection of the equatorial region in the appropriate panels in fig .",
    "f1 . the cp behavior of the line width does not exactly follow that of the cl given its large growth inside the limb ( similar to cp ) and gradual ( uneven ) increase above ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of growth above the polar limb is probably due to spatial averaging and the correspondence between polar plumes and significantly reduced line widths ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that is most clearly visible in the southern portion of the fig .",
    "f1 panels .",
    "we have seen that cool tr lines have a very different cl line width variation from those of the upper tr ( or corona ) .",
    "we believe that this is because much of the lower tr is dominated by the extension of the chromospheric spicules observed with unprecedented spatial ( 0.2 ) and temporal ( 5 s ) resolution by _ hinode_/sot .",
    "the left column of fig .  [ f2 ] illustrates how the limb chromosphere is dominated by the superposition of a large number of long , thin ( @xmath20200 km ) spicules that extend to heights of between 5 and 10 and that undergo significant ( at least @xmath21km / s ) motions along and perpendicular to the line - of - sight ( los ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that there are two types of spicules present in the _ hinode _ limb observations with very different dynamic properties .",
    "type i spicules evolve on timescales of 3 - 5 minutes reaching velocities of 10 - 40km / s along their long axis @xcite .",
    "type ii spicules on the other hand , occur on timescales of 10 - 60s and reach apparent longitudinal velocities of 50 - 150km / s .",
    "@xcite have shown that these chromospheric features undergo vigorous alfvnic motions with amplitudes around @xmath22km / s and periods ranging from 100 to 500s .",
    "why do we believe the same fine - scale structures show up in tr emission lines ?",
    "a large body of literature exists describing the presence of tr spicules at the uv limb ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , @xcite find evidence for rapid heating of type ii spicules to tr temperatures , a picture that is supported by our observations from the transition region and coronal explorer ( _ trace _ ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "f2 ( and the supplied online movie ) shows that there is a qualitatively good correspondence between spicules visible in the _ hinode _ -h image and _ trace _ 1600 and 1700 passbands despite the gulf in spatial resolution .",
    "it is worth noting that off - limb the _ trace _ 1600 and 1700 passbands are dominated by ( @xmath23k ) and ( @xmath24k ) emission respectively , where the relative contributions are computed by folding the off - limb skylab spectral atlas data @xcite into the trace uv filter response functions ( the 1600 passband contains 63% emission , and 27% , while the 1700 passband contains 62% and 18% ) .",
    "these findings strongly suggest that the lower tr is structured by the same spicules that @xcite observe with sot in the chromosphere - results compatible with inferred fine - scale structuring in the tr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we deduce that lower tr dynamics are dominated by the same transverse and longitudinal spicular motions .",
    "of course , the superposition of many finely - structured features undergoing vigorous motion naturally leads to non - thermal line broadening of emission lines observed by a uv spectrograph with coarse spatial resolution , like sumer . @xcite",
    "have previously proposed that flows _ along _ dynamic spicules are responsible for the increase of line widths at the limb and the former has attempted to model this phenomenon with varying degrees of success ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "here we provide , for the first time , a comprehensive interpretation and quantitative model of the line width variation that is based on our recent _ hinode _ results and one that intrinsically connects very dynamic spicules with alfvn waves on very small spatial scales .",
    "we have developed a forward model to test whether the observed on - disk and limb behavior of the line can be explained by los superposition of unresolved alfvnic and longitudinal motions of type i and ii spicules .",
    "we adopt a monte carlo approach to simulate spectral profiles based on the superposed motion of spicules and of internetwork , nearly - horizontal , `` canopy''-like ( @xmath25 ) structures -using the sot observations of the statistical properties of these features as a strong observational constraint .",
    "we allow a large number of structures ( @xmath26 ) to occupy a narrow ( 2 wide ) strip of the sun s surface from disk center to 20 above the limb , prescribing that @xmath27 type i and @xmath28 type ii spicules occur in close proximity to network elements ( given a constant separation of @xmath29 mm ) and @xmath30 independent @xmath25 structures that connect those network elements .",
    "the sot observations @xcite give constraints for each feature ( spicule or @xmath25 structure ) : an angle with respect to the vertical ( randomly chosen from a gaussian around @xmath31 with 1/e width @xmath32 ; @xmath33 ) , a length @xmath34 ( randomly chosen from an exponential distribution with scale height @xmath35 ; e(l ; @xmath35 ) ) , a fixed starting height above the surface ( @xmath36 ) , a longitudinal velocity g(@xmath37;@xmath38 ) , a transverse or alfvnic amplitude g(@xmath39 ; @xmath40 ) , the observed alfvn wave periods ( uniformly chosen between 100 and 500s ) , and a fixed relative intensity @xmath41 that varies along its length with scale height @xmath42 . after selecting the location , angle , intensity and velocities of each feature , we compute the spectrum of the simulated strip under the assumption that the simulated spectral line is optically thin , i.e , the `` observed '' line profile in each pixel is the sum of thermal width gaussians emitted by each feature ( in that pixel ) that is then doppler shifted by the net velocity of the feature projected onto the los ( i.e. , a mixture of the longitudinal and transverse velocities ) .",
    "we take into account the smearing effect of different alfvn wave phases during longer exposure times by calculating several spectra per `` exposure '' . finally ,",
    "for each pixel in the strip , we perform ga gaussian fits to deduce the intensity , line width ( see fig .  [ f4 ] ) and doppler shift .",
    "we note that the network - related structures ( type i and type ii ) are forced to occur within 5 mm of the network loci and that the @xmath25 structures are allowed to occur everywhere in - between .",
    "in addition , we note that while spicular motions play an important role in this model , our model does not necessarily imply that all tr emission comes from spicules .",
    "after all , the scale height of the type i spicules is set to be rather small ( 400 km ) , and a large number of @xmath25 structures occur in the model .",
    "we point out that numerical simulations and observations imply that spicular motions have a significant impact on the observed velocities and line widths of the tr @xcite . whether the spicules ( e.g. , type i ) emit significantly in the uv or not requires further ( detailed ) investigation , but",
    "the same simulations show that the tr emission will be moved up and down by the underlying chromospheric features .    the properties of each feature ( type i , ii , or @xmath25 )",
    "are set by thirteen parameters , most of which are strictly constrained by sot observations : e.g. , scale height , minimum height , velocities , angle from the vertical , period range of the waves , etc . the number of structures per network element or the relative intensities of the network and canopy features are less well constrained .",
    "however , we stress that the point of this effort is not to derive such detailed parameters , but rather to investigate qualitatively which features have a significant effect on the network contrast and cl variation of the sumer line widths",
    ". we will discuss the intricacies of the forward model in a future ( longer ) paper .",
    "[ f4 ] shows a comparison of the simulated cl line width ( top ) and intensity ( bottom ) variations , compared to a sample of one radial ( non - averaged ) cut from the sumer spectra of fig .",
    "f1 ( black lines ) .",
    "we see that a model in which none of the structures carry alfvn waves ( blue lines ) shows a significant , but too small , increase in line widths around network elements ( from longitudinal spicular flows ) , and lacks the necessary line width in the internetwork .",
    "more importantly , this model does not show any increase of line width toward the limb , both of which _ are _ observed in sumer spectra ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) . by switching on alfvn waves with 40km / s",
    "rms amplitude ( green line ; reasonable given the projections of , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the network spicules , we see that the network line widths are now similar in amplitude to those observed by sumer .",
    "in addition , the superposition of many structures in various network elements along the los towards the limb naturally leads to an increase of the line width above 0.9r@xmath19 .",
    "however , the internetwork line widths are still too low .",
    "a final sample model run includes alfvn waves in all structures ( again with 40km / s rms amplitude ; red line ) and shows a striking similarity of intensity and line width profiles with those observed by sumer .",
    "it reproduces not only the variability of the intensity across the disk and the average values of the line width , but also reproduces the values in the internetwork region , the generally isotropic nature of the cl line width variation , network enhancement and even the bump that starts just inside the limb and peaks a few arcseconds above it .",
    "our results indicate that the sumer observations of line widths are indeed fully compatible with the los superposition of a large number of finely scaled spicules that carry significant longitudinal mass flows as well as vigorous alfvn waves .",
    "since the longitudinal and transverse velocity components are of roughly the same order , the overall center - to - limb variation is relatively limited , naturally producing an isotropy of line widths which had been used as an argument against alfvn waves in the past ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is a slight but significant increase of line widths in a region close to and off the limb , which seems to be caused by alfvnic motions along the much increased number of structures ( the first few 2 pixels around the limb contain spicules from three neighboring network elements ! ) .",
    "the steep drop - off of the line width as we go above a certain height above the limb is directly related to the dwindling number of spicular structures : spicules have typical heights of 5,000 km with very few above 10,000 km .",
    "this straightforward interpretation contradicts earlier work that explains this decrease as a result of ion - cyclotron damping of high - frequency alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "our model also suggests that the increase of line widths in and around the magnetic network is directly related to the concentration of spicule flows along the field _ and _ alfvnic motions .",
    "we expect that similar results will hold for uv emission lines formed in the low tr ( t@xmath0250,000k ) although we note that opacity plays a significant role in the broadening of cooler lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that has some opacity at the limb as well , explaining why the forward model predicts intensity increases at the limb that are twice those observed .",
    "it is interesting that , for emission lines formed at temperatures above 500,000k ( e.g. , like those of ) , the bump at the limb does not appear , instead we observe a linear increase of line width with the decreasing density above the limb , indicative of the undamped growth of alfvn waves in the extended corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". our model does not apply to these hotter lines , since the spatial distribution of emission from these lines is no longer dominated by spicules , but rather by thermal conduction and the overlying coronal structure .",
    "further study will be necessary to explain the larger ( by @xmath185km / s ) line widths in polar and equatorial coronal holes .",
    "these enhancements may well be caused by the lower densities and the resulting higher amplitude of the alfvn waves ( for an equal energy flux ) .",
    "detailed studies with sot are necessary to determine whether different amplitudes for the spicular flows perhaps also play a role , especially since the mix of spicule types changes considerably in coronal holes @xcite .",
    "we note that the absolute magnitude of the line width is of significant importance in constraining the amplitude of the alfvn waves that are needed for solar wind models .",
    "unfortunately , the literature reveals a wide scatter of values for the same tr uv emission lines ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from different instruments , epochs , locations , etc .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising since our model shows that we can expect significantly different values of line widths for the same line depending on proximity to the limb , the small - scale distribution of magnetic flux ( which varies considerably over the solar cycle ) and the orientation of the magnetic field ( since inclined spicules will show varying contributions of longitudinal and transverse velocities ) .",
    "in addition to these physical causes , we have found that the fitting algorithm and form of functional fit ( gaussian with constant , linear or quadratic background ) can have a significant impact ( @xmath43 km / s ) on the magnitude of the line width ; e.g. , the more complex the background form of the fit the smaller the resulting line width .",
    "our forward model is only a first , primitive , step towards a comprehensive understanding of what dominates the emission of the tr .",
    "there has been extensive discusson on the detailed physical nature of the tr in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , much of which has ignored the intrinsically dynamic nature of the tr ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is inevitable given its connection to spicules .",
    "it is clear from our results that more sophisticated models of the tr are needed that take into account the intrinsically dynamic and finely structure nature of its dominant components .",
