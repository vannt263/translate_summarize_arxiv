    "<S> the stability and instability of quantum motion is studied in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the jaynes - cummings dynamics can be unstable in the regime of chaotic walking of an atom in the quantized field of a standing wave in the absence of any other interaction with environment . </S>",
    "<S> this quantum instability manifests itself in strong variations of quantum purity and entropy and in exponential sensitivity of fidelity of quantum states to small variations in the atom - field detuning . </S>",
    "<S> it is quantified in terms of the respective classical maximal lyapunov exponent that can be estimated in appropriate in - out experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> the problem of stability of quantum dynamics has attracted a great interest by its own right and in relation to the field of quantum information and computation . </S>",
    "<S> classical instability is usually defined as an exponential separation of two nearly trajectories in time with an asymptotic rate given by the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> perfectly isolated quantum systems are unitary and can not be unstable in this sense even if their classical limits are chaotic @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that quantum coherence is destroyed due to interaction with an environment @xcite which is usually modeled by a heat bath with infinitely many degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> environment - induced decoherence causes quantum - entropy increase which is dominated by the classical lyapunov exponents @xcite . in an alternative approach </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the quantum instability is proposed to be measured by the decay of the fidelity or the overlap @xmath1 of two wave functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , identical at @xmath4 , that evolve under slightly different hamiltonians .    in a number of numerical studies @xcite for a variety of classically chaotic models </S>",
    "<S> it has been established that the overlap decay may be algebraic , gaussian , and exponential . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of perturbations in hamiltonians and other factors determine which of these regimes prevails .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that instability of quantum dynamics and its exponential sensitivity to initial conditions and small variations in parameters may occur in a paradigmic cavity - qed system with a single environmental degree of freedom . to specify the problem we consider the standard model in cavity qed jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xcite @xmath5 which describes the interaction between a two - level atom with lower , @xmath6 , and upper , @xmath7 , states , the transition frequency @xmath8 , and the pauli operators @xmath9 and a quantized electromagnetic - field mode with creation , @xmath10 , and annihilation , @xmath11 operators forming a standing wave with the frequency @xmath12 and the wave vector @xmath13 in an ideal cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the atom and field become dynamically entangled by their interaction with the state of the combined system after the interaction time @xmath14 @xmath15 to be expanded over the fock field states @xmath16 , @xmath17 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the complex - valued probability amplitudes to find the field in the state @xmath16 and the atom in the states @xmath7 and @xmath6 , respectively . in the process of emitting and absorbing photons , atoms not only change their internal electronic states but their external translational states change as well due to the photon recoil effect . </S>",
    "<S> if atoms are not too cold and their average momenta are large as compared to the photon momentum @xmath20 , one can describe the translational degree of freedom classically . </S>",
    "<S> the whole dynamics is now governed by the hamilton - schrdinger equations @xcite that have the following normalized form in the frame rotating with the frequency @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the atomic center - of - mass position and momentum , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> dot denotes differentiation with respect to dimensionless time @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the amplitude coupling constant . the normalized recoil frequency , @xmath27 , and the atom - field detuning , @xmath28 , are the control parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> inspite of existence of an infinite number of the integrals of motion @xmath29 and conservation of the total energy @xmath30 the hamilton - schrdinger system ( [ mainsys ] ) is , in general , non - integrable . </S>",
    "<S> the type of the center - of - mass motion depends strongly on the values of the detuning @xmath31 . in the limit of zero detuning and </S>",
    "<S> with initially excited or deexcited atoms , the optical potential disappears , and atoms move with a constant velocity @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum evolution is periodic with the period @xmath33 , and exact solutions for purity , von neumann entropy , fidelity @xmath34 , and other quantum characteristics can be found in the explicit forms . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the atomic population inversion at @xmath35 is the following : @xmath36 with the detuning being large , @xmath37 , the optical potential is shallow , atom moves with almost a constant velocity , @xmath38 , slightly modulated by the standing wave , and its inversion oscillates with a small depth ( excepting for the case of the so - called doppler - rabi resonance with maximal rabi oscillations that occur at the condition @xmath39 @xcite ) . if the atomic kinetic energy , @xmath40 , is not enough to overcome barriers of the optical potential , the atomic center of mass oscillates in one of the potential wells .     and </S>",
    "<S> the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath0 ( in units of @xmath26 ) on the atom - field detuning @xmath31 ( in units of @xmath26).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    numerical simulation shows that there exist conditions , defined mainly by the values of the detuning , when atoms move chaotically in a cavity . </S>",
    "<S> this type of motion may be called a chaotic or random walking , and it is quantified by positive values of the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath0 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we show by the dotted line the dependence @xmath41 computed with eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mainsys ] ) and the following initial conditions : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , the atom is prepared in the state @xmath7 and the field is initially in a coherent state with the average number of photons @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized recoil frequency is chosen to be @xmath45 , a reasonable value with usual atoms in a high - quality optical microcavity in the strong - coupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> stability of the computation with respect to truncating the set ( [ mainsys ] ) was checked . in most </S>",
    "<S> the cases @xmath46 was taken .    </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement between the internal atomic and field degrees of freedom can be characterized by the quantity known as purity @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the reduced atomic density matrix @xmath49 with the total density matrix to be @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> purity is maximal if an atom is in one of its energetic states @xmath6 or @xmath7 ; i.  e. @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> purity is minimal if @xmath52 , i.  e. @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the identity matrix . in terms of the probability amplitudes , it is given by @xmath55 the root mean square variance of purity , @xmath56 has been computed in the range of the detuning @xmath57 at the same conditions as it was done in computing the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> irregular oscillations of @xmath58 occurs on the same interval of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> computing the von neumann entropy , @xmath61 , we have found the same correlations of its variance with @xmath0 .     </S>",

    "<S> we compute the time @xmath70 , the atom with a given value @xmath65 needs to reach one of the nodes of the standing wave at @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and the number of times , @xmath62 , when it changes its direction of motion . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering function @xmath70 is found to have a self - similar structure with singularities on a cantor - like set of initial values of momenta @xmath65 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a we demonstrate the mechanism of generating this set at @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> there are two sets of atomic trajectories with @xmath73 , the countable one consisting of separatrix - like trajectories , corresponding to the ends of the intervals in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a , and the uncountable one consisting of trajectories with @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the chaotic motion can be , in principle , verified in experiments on 1 d - scattering of atoms at the standing wave . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b demonstrates sensitive dependence of the atomic positions on @xmath65 at a fixed time moment . </S>",
    "<S> a smooth segment of this function in the range @xmath75 should be attributed to atomic oscillations in the first well of the optical potential since these values of @xmath65 are not enough to overcome the respective potential barrier . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath65 exceeds a critical values , atoms leave the well , and it is practically impossible to predict even the sign of the atomic position . the so - called predictability horizon can be estimated as follows : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the confidence interval and @xmath78 the initial inaccuracy in preparing initial atomic positions . in order to demonstrate the quantum - classical correspondence in the chaotic regime we compute the dependence of the output values of the atomic population inversion @xmath66 at a fixed moment on its initial values @xmath67 with the other conditions and parameters to be the same . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]c illustrates that this function is regular in the range @xmath79 , where the atomic center - of - mass motion is regular , and is irregular if @xmath80 where atoms move chaotically .    to quantify instability of quantum evolution in cavity </S>",
    "<S> qed we compute the decay of the fidelity @xmath34 which is the overlap ( [ fidelity ] ) of two states @xmath81 and @xmath82 , identical at @xmath4 , that evolve under two hamiltonians ( [ janes - cum ] ) with the slightly different detunings @xmath83 .     </S>",
    "<S> ( logarithmic scale ) in the chaotic ( thick and thin lines ) and regular ( dotted line ) regimes . </S>",
    "<S> time @xmath84 is in units of @xmath85.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we have found previously ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) that with the initial momentum @xmath43 and @xmath68 the type of atomic motion depends strongly on the initial atomic inversion @xmath86 . if an atom is prepared initially in one of its energetic states , i.  e. @xmath87 , its classical and quantum dynamics are unstable , whereas they are stable with @xmath88 under the same other conditions . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we show for convenience the decay of the quantity @xmath89 in the regimes of chaotic walking ( thick and thin lines , @xmath87 ) and regular motion ( dotted line , @xmath88 ) with @xmath90 . in the chaotic regime </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity decays exponentially with the rate @xmath91 to be equal to the maximal lyapunov exponent computed with the set ( [ mainsys ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result does not depend on the values of differences in the control parameters @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity practically does not decay in the regular regime at @xmath88 , and the respective maximal lyapunov exponent was computed to be zero .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that sensitive dependence of quantum motion both on initial states and parameters may arise with an atom in a quantized cavity field . </S>",
    "<S> single chaotic degree of freedom , arising naturally when we take into account photon recoils , provides quantum instability and irreversibility . </S>",
    "<S> we do not need an infinite bath or any kind of noise for that . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum instability has been shown to be quantified by the respective maximal lyapunov exponent providing a quantum - classical correspondence . </S>"
