    "the widening of the region reflecting chimera pattern due to the introduction of time delay @xmath45 is observed in the parameter space as well .",
    "these proves that the chimera patterns persist as a natural link between incoherence and coherence even in the presence of homogeneous delay in the inter - layer interaction , irrespective of the amount of time - delay .",

    "information transmission delays from upper to lower layer i.e. , @xmath56 and from lower to upper layer i.e. , @xmath57 are different in this case .",
    "these heterogeneous time delays can also be reduced to homogeneous time delay @xmath58 , by a time shift transformation , recently proposed by lucken et al .",
    "but our main concern will be with the emergence of chimera patterns due to the co - action of these different time - delays @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    in order to do that , first we keep @xmath3 fixed at @xmath59 , where chimera was observed for a long range of @xmath45 in the homogeneous delay case ( fig .",

    "in fact , then we found a region ( in black color ) where incoherent and chimera pattern coexist in the parameter space .",
    "for further increment in @xmath56 and @xmath57 , coexistence of chimera and coherence is observed ( green region ) and even higher values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 leads the upper layer to the state of coherence ( blue region ) .",
    "the more the value of @xmath56 , less the value of @xmath57 is needed ( and vice versa ) for the network to attain coherent state as in fig .",
    "[ twopara_hetero](a ) .",
    "this is how in this case , chimera may be found in a wide range of the @xmath60 parameter space .",
    "next , taking @xmath3 from the regime where synchrony is observed for a long range of @xmath45 ( the homogeneous delay ) , we again discover a convincing enough chimera region in the @xmath60 parameter space followed by a synchronous region . for fixed @xmath64 , in the @xmath60 parameter space with @xmath65 $ ] and @xmath66 $ ]",
    ", disordered state ( yellow region ) appears only for very small values of @xmath67 as shown in fig .",
    "[ twopara_hetero](b ) .",
    "but as both the delays increase , the region of coexistence of incoherence and chimera ( in black color ) and a region of coexistence of coherence and chimera pattern ( in green color ) develops as in the previous case followed by the coherent state ( blue region ) .",
    "finally , we fix @xmath68 at such a value where no chimera was observed for almost any value of the homogeneous time - delay @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ twopara_homo ] ) .",
    "taking @xmath68 , for @xmath56 and @xmath57 satisfying @xmath69 , the chimera state can emerge in the uncoupled neurons as in fig .",
    "[ twopara_hetero](c ) .",
    "the region ( in black color ) of coexistence of disordered and chimera states is identified .",
    "but coherence has not been observed for almost any value of @xmath56 and @xmath57 in this case .",
    "in fact , even if we fix @xmath3 at other smaller or larger values than the above values taken , we will have the similar type of @xmath60 space except only the range of @xmath56 and @xmath57 at which disordered , chimera and coherent states show up .",
    "this is how the information transmission delays can play a crucial role as far as the formation of chimera pattern is concerned . by introducing heterogeneous delay , we tried to make our model as general as possible , however , the effect of both @xmath56 and @xmath57 are similar as seen in fig .",
    "[ twopara_hetero ] .",
    "in summary , we have inspected how multi - layering can bring about chimera states in a network of uncoupled neurons where the multi - layering layer ( lower layer ) of neurons are globally coupled .",
    "the neurons in the multi - layering layer has been assumed to be connected with electrical synapses whereas inter layer connection has been supposed to be of chemical synaptic type .",
    "the coaction of these two types of synapses leads the uncoupled layer ( upper layer ) to a chimera state .",
    "we discussed the existence of density dependent threshold for the emergence of chimera states in uncoupled neurons .",
    "it is identified that delay in the inter layer coupling may enlarge the range of inter layer coupling strength for which the chimera pattern appears , compared to instantaneous inter layer coupling .",
    "we also obtained chimera states when we took other types of coupling in the common medium i.e. the multi - layering layer ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "our results therefore seem to be relevant for brain dynamics where coexistence of coherent and incoherent behaviors of the neurons appear .",
    "in the present work our object is to study the behavior of the uncoupled neurons which are not directly coupled rather they are communicated with each others via a common medium .",
    "the neuronal dynamics can be controlled by the coaction of two synapses , namely of electric and chemical synapses .",
    "we consider each neuron in the multilayer network with hindmarsh - rose neuronal model dynamics .",
    "the hindmarsh - rose neuronal model is a popular for its chaotic bursting behavior and the original form is as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71-variable represents the membrane potential , @xmath72 and @xmath73 represent the transport of ions across the membrane through the fast and slow channels respectively .",

    "synaptic current flows from presynaptic neuron to postsynaptic neuron only in response to the secretion of neurotransmitters ( e.g. acetylchosine , glutamate etc . ) .",
    "this synapse is either excitatory or inhibitory that depends on the neurotransmitters .",
    "we assume the chemical synapses are in excitatory for @xmath100 as it has a important function in information processing within the brain and throughout the peripheral nervous system .",

    "<S> even the coupling topology is not restricted to the nonlocal one , rather chimera states have been noticed in global @xcite as well as in local interactions @xcite and even for one - way local coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> chimera - like states have also been well investigated on complex networks @xcite , time - varying network @xcite and modular type neural networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> apart from numerical and theoretical studies , experimental evidence of chimera states is reported in optical coupled - map lattices @xcite , coupled chemical oscillators @xcite , metronomes @xcite and squid meta - materials @xcite etc .    the existence of chimera state is strongly connected to neuronal systems , e.g. various types of brain diseases @xcite such as parkinson s disease , epileptic seizures , alzheimer s disease , schizophrenia and brain tumors . </S>",
    "<S> chimera states are also related with the real world phenomena of unihemispheric slow - wave sleep @xcite of some aquatic animals ( e.g. dolphins ) and migrated birds . during slow - wave sleep in these species half part of the brain </S>",
    "<S> is in sleep and the other half remains awake . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly indicates that the neurons of the sleepy part are synchronized ( coherent ) and desynchronized ( incoherent ) in the awake part of the cerebral hemisphere , which resembles the chimera state . </S>",
    "<S> recently , chimera states are observed in neuronal oscillators if the neurons are locally , globally or nonlocally coupled via chemical synapses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but what if the neurons are not connected to each other ? </S>",
    "<S> diverse nervous activities are found not only among coupled neuron groups in the same brain region , but also among uncoupled neuron groups in the same brain region or among different cortical areas . </S>",
    "<S> it can even cross over two semi - spheres of the brain . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the nervous system , activities are present not only among the coupled neurons , but also among the uncoupled neurons . studies on neuron synchronization are mainly focused on two cases : the coupled neurons and the uncoupled neurons . </S>",
    "<S> previously , synchronization is observed in uncoupled neurons subject to a common noisy field @xcite and also under neuron s membrane potential stimulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally it was observed that synchronization in different neurons may appear in the same region of the brain and even in different regions in the brain @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> most of the earlier works on chimera states assume that the oscillators are on a single layer whatever be the network topology is . </S>",
    "<S> again , there are many physical systems that do not interact directly but exchange the information through a common medium , for instance , in the huygen s experiment the two pendulum clocks were interacting through the common wooden beam from which they were hanging . </S>",
    "<S> also this type of indirect interaction is particularly important in biological systems , e.g. , populations of cells in which oscillatory reactions are taking place @xcite through the interaction via chemicals that diffuse in the surrounding medium .    in this paper , we investigate an architecture where the neuronal oscillators in the upper layer ( the layer of our interest ) have no connection among them , while they interact with each other via another layer of similar oscillators , thus forming a multilayer structure . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this is the first observation of chimera states in uncoupled neurons in the form of multilayer network . </S>",
    "<S> recent research and reviews attest to the fact that multilayer networks are the next frontier in network science @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , not only are the interactions between the constituents of a complex system limited and thus best described by networks , it is also a fact that the processes happening in one network may vitally affect another network , and moreover , that a node in one network is likely part of another network . </S>",
    "<S> from the world economy and transportation systems to social media and biological systems , it is clear that such interdependencies exist , thus making networks of networks or multilayer networks a much better and realistic description of such systems .    </S>",
    "<S> this type of multilayer structure is also quite evident in neuronal networks . </S>",
    "<S> so it would be of obvious importance to study a network having an architecture of the this type taking neuronal models as the nodes of both the layers . </S>",
    "<S> we take the neuron dynamics in terms of hindmarsh - rose neuronal model which exhibits various types of bursting dynamics such as spiking , plateau bursting , square - wave bursting ( periodic and chaotic ) and mixed mode bursting etc . depending on the system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> two types of synapses i.e. electrical and chemical synapses exist through which neurons communicate with each others . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , neurons may not be connected with each other with the same type of synapses everywhere . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a recent work on chimera - like states has been done on neural network inspired by the neuronal connection of the c. elegans soil worm , organized into six interconnected communities , assuming that the neurons are connected with electrical synapses within the communities and with chemical synapses across them @xcite . in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we consider that the neurons are connected with electrical synapses within the bottom layer ( the medium ) and with chemical synapses across the layers . again in neuronal networks , delays arise due to finite propagation times along the axons or to reaction times at chemical synapses . </S>",
    "<S> also depending on the physiological properties of axons and synapses , these delays in signal transmission between different cells of the network may differ . </S>",
    "<S> thus time delay in inter - layer information transmission process is indisputable and it can be heterogeneous too . hence our aim in this article is to examine how these two types of synaptic connection affect the dynamics of upper layer and how chimera pattern emerges due to that competing effects of two synapses and finally to study the influence of inter - layer synaptic delay ( both homogeneous and heterogeneous ) on the upper layer dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath0 identical isolated neurons which are connected through a common medium . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that isolated neurons are situated on same layer ( upper layer ) and medium as globally connected neurons ( lower layer ) . </S>",
    "<S> each isolated neuron interact directly with one neuron ( its replica ) in the medium . as we are considering global coupling in the multi - layering layer ( common medium ) and the uncoupled neurons are only interacting with its replica in the common medium </S>",
    "<S> , so the spatial order of the neurons in the upper layer is same as the spatial order of the neurons in the common medium . </S>",
    "<S> the schematic diagram of the network is shown in fig .  [ schematic ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in terms of recently developed multi - layer networks , our proposed network is a multilayer network with two layers . </S>",
    "<S> we consider each neuron as hindmarsh - rose neuron model . </S>",
    "<S> the neurons in the medium are connected through electrical synapses as they allow direct and passive flow of electron via gap junctions . </S>",
    "<S> these gap junctions permit for mutual instantaneous transmission of electron between the neurons which are spatially very close to each other . </S>",
    "<S> the main goal for considering electrical synapses in the lower layer ( medium ) is to synchronize ( or coherent motion ) electrical activity among the neurons . </S>",
    "<S> we assume electrical synapses among the globally coupled neurons in the common medium which is homogeneous distribution of the medium . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is more realistic in biological and chemical systems , as homogeneous medium is observed either in biological systems by the fast diffusion of the small molecules or in chemical systems by stirring the solution . on the other hand , the isolated neurons are connected with the common medium through chemical synapses . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical synapses typically function in a longer range compared to electrical synapses , it would thus be more likely to connect across the layers . </S>",
    "<S> thus the simultaneous effect of electrical and chemical synaptic coupling is best represented by multilayer structure where the neurons in the medium are connected through electrical synapses while across the layers through chemical synapses . </S>"
