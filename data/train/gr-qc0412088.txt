    "einstein s general relativity ( gr ) can be considered one of the major scientific achievement of last century . for the first time , a comprehensive theory of spacetime , gravity and matter has been formulated giving rise to a new conception of the universe . however , in the last thirty years , several shortcomings came out in the einstein scheme and people began to investigate if gr is the only and fundamental theory capable of explaining completely gravitational interaction .",
    "such issues come , essentially , from cosmology and quantum field theory . in the first case ,",
    "the presence of the big bang singularity , flatness and horizon problems @xcite led to the statement that standard cosmological model @xcite , based on gr and standard model of particle physics , is inadequate to describe the universe in extreme regimes . on the other hand ,",
    "gr is a _ classical _ theory which does not work as a fundamental theory , if one wants to achieve a full quantum description of spacetime ( and then of gravity ) . due to this facts and , first of all , to the lack of a definitive quantum gravity theory ,",
    "alternative theories of gravity have been pursued in order to attempt , at least , a semi - classical scheme where gr and its positive results could be recovered .",
    "one of the most fruitful approach has been that of _ extended theories of gravity _ ( etg ) which have become a sort of paradigm in the study of gravitational interaction based on the enlargement and the correction of the traditional einstein scheme .",
    "the paradigm consists in adding higher - order curvature invariants and minimally or non - minimally coupled scalar fields into dynamics which come out from quantum terms in the effective action of gravity .",
    "other motivations come from the issue of a complete recovering of mach principle @xcite which leads to assume a varying gravitational coupling .",
    "all these approaches are not the `` _ full quantum gravity _ '' but are needed as working schemes toward it . in any case , they are going to furnish consistent and physically reliable results .",
    "for example , it is well known that higher  derivative theories @xcite and scalar ",
    "tensor theories @xcite give rise to inflationary cosmological solutions capable , in principle , of solving the shortcomings of standard cosmological model . besides , they have relevant features also from the quantum cosmology point of view since they give interesting solutions to the problem of initial , at least in the restricted context of minisuperspaces @xcite .",
    "furthermore , every unification scheme as superstrings , supergravity or grand unified theories , takes into account effective actions where nonminimal couplings to the geometry or higher  order terms in the curvature invariants come out .",
    "such contributions are due to one  loop or higher  loop corrections in the high  curvature regimes near the full ( not yet available ) quantum gravity regime @xcite .",
    "however , in the weak ",
    "limit approximation , all these classes of theories should be expected to reproduce gr which , in any case , is experimentally tested only in this limit @xcite .",
    "this fact is matter of debate since several relativistic theories ( in particular etg ) _ do not _ reproduce exactly einstein results in the newtonian approximation but , in some sense , generalize them .",
    "in fact , as it was firstly noticed by stelle @xcite , a @xmath1theory gives rise to yukawa  like corrections to the newtonian potential which could have interesting physical consequences .",
    "for example , some authors claim for explaining the flat rotation curves of galaxies by using such terms @xcite .",
    "others @xcite have shown that a conformal theory of gravity is nothing else but a fourth  order theory containing such terms in the newtonian limit and , by invoking these results , it could be possible to explain _ the missing matter problem without dark matter_.    besides , indications of an apparent , anomalous , long  range acceleration revealed from the data analysis of pioneer 10/11 , galileo , and ulysses spacecrafts could be framed in a general theoretical scheme by taking into account yukawa  like or higher order corrections to the newtonian potential @xcite .",
    "in general , any relativistic theory of gravitation can yield corrections to the newton potential ( see for example @xcite ) which , in the post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism , could furnish tests for the same theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore the newborn _ gravitational lensing astronomy _",
    "@xcite is giving rise to additional tests of gravity over small , large , and very large scales which very soon will provide direct measurements for the variation of newton coupling @xmath2 @xcite , the potential of galaxies , clusters of galaxies @xcite and several other features of gravitating systems .",
    "such data will be very likely capable of confirming or ruling out the physical consistency of gr or of any etg .    in this review ,",
    "we want to discuss the newtonian limit of etg , trying to establish a link to gr by putting in evidence the common features . in particular , we show that , in the newtonian limit , such theories can have features which `` generalize '' the newton potential and could explain several observational results .",
    "for example , a quadratic correction to the newtonian potential strictly depends on the presence of a scalar  field potential which acts , in the low energy limit , as a cosmological constant .",
    "the layout of the review is the following .",
    "in sec.ii , we discuss the foundation of any metric theory of gravity : the equivalence principle in all its formulations .",
    "after , we develop the parametrized post newtonian ( ppn ) formalism which constitutes the basis to compare every theory of gravity .",
    "moreover , we outline the main features of gr discussing , in particular , the weak field approximation , the linearized einstein equations and the gravitational radiation .",
    "finally , a discussion of classical tests of gr is pursued considering the current experimental limits of the ppn parameters .",
    "sec.iii is devoted to the etg which are classified according to their main features .",
    "we start with the minimal extension of gr which is the inclusion of a cosmological constant in einstein equations .",
    "after , we discuss scalar - tensor and higher - order theories of gravity deriving , in every case , the field equations .    in sec.iv , the newtonian limit of etg is discussed considering , in particular , fourth - order and scalar - tensor theories . as an application ,",
    "we develop the approach for string - dilaton gravity deriving its weak field limit .",
    "the discussion of the results and the conclusions are drawn in sec.v .",
    "equivalence principle ( ep ) is the foundation of every metric theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "+ the first formulation of ep comes out from the theory of gravitation studied by galileo and newton ; it is called the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) and it states that the `` inertial mass '' @xmath3 and the `` gravitational mass '' @xmath4 of any object are equivalent . in newtonian physics , the `` inertial mass '' @xmath3 is a coefficient which appears in the second newton law : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the force exerted on a mass @xmath3 with acceleration @xmath7 ; in special relativity ( sr ) ( without gravitation ) the `` inertial mass '' of a body appears to be proportional to the rest energy of the body : @xmath8 .",
    "considering the newtonian gravitational attraction , one introduces the `` gravitational mass '' @xmath4 : the gravitational attraction force between two bodies of `` gravitational mass '' @xmath4 and @xmath9 is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the newtonian gravitational constant and @xmath12 the distance between the two bodies .",
    "various experiments @xcite demonstrate that @xmath13 .",
    "the present accuracy of this relation is of the order of @xmath14 ; spatial projects are currently designed to achieve precision of @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "+ the wep statement implies that it is impossible to distinguish between the effects of a gravitational field from those experienced in an uniformly accelerated frame , using the simple observation of the free - falling particles behavior .",
    "the wep can be formulated again in the following statement @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if an uncharged test body is placed at an initial event in spacetime and given an initial velocity there , then its subsequent trajectory will be independent of its internal structure and composition_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    a generalization of wep claims that sr is only locally valid",
    ". it has been achieved by einstein after the formulation of sr theory where the concept of mass looses some of its uniqueness : the mass is reduced to a manifestation of energy and momentum . according to einstein ,",
    "it is impossible to distinguish between uniform acceleration and an external gravitational field , not only for free - falling particles but whatever is the experiment .",
    "this equivalence principle has been called einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) ; its main statements are the following @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * _ wep is valid _ ; * _ the outcome of any local non - gravitational test experiment is independent of velocity of free - falling apparatus _ ; * _ the outcome of any local non - gravitational test experiment is independent of where and when in the universe it is performed_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    one defines as  local non - gravitational experiment \" an experiment performed in a small - size freely falling laboratory . from the eep , one gets that the gravitational interaction depends on the curvature of spacetime , the postulates of any metric theory of gravity have to be satisfied @xcite :    * _ spacetime is endowed with a metric @xmath17 _ ; * _ the world lines of test bodies are geodesics of the metric _ ; * _ in local freely falling frames , called local lorentz frames , the non - gravitational laws of physics are those of sr_.    one of the predictions of this principle is the gravitational red - shift , verified experimentally by pound and rebka in 1960 @xcite .",
    "+ it is worth stressing that gravitational interactions are specifically excluded from wep and eep . in order to classify alternative theories of gravity ,",
    "the gravitational weak equivalence principle ( gwep ) and the strong equivalence principle ( sep ) has to be introduced .",
    "the sep extends the eep by including all the laws of physics in its terms @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * _ wep is valid for self - gravitating bodies as well as for test bodies ( gwep ) _ ; * _ the outcome of any local test experiment is independent of the velocity of the free - falling apparatus _ ; * _ the outcome of any local test experiment is independent of where and when in the universe it is performed_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    therefore , the sep contains the eep , when gravitational forces are ignored .",
    "many authors claim that the only theory coherent with the sep is general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "gr is not the only theory of gravitation and , up to now , at least twenty - five alternative theories of gravity have been investigated from the 60 s , considering the spacetime to be `` special relativistic '' at a background level and treating gravitation as a lorentz - invariant field on the background .",
    "+ two different classes of experiments have been studied : the first ones testing the foundations of gravitation theory  among them the ep  the second one testing the metric theories of gravity where spacetime is endowed with a metric tensor and where the eep is valid . however , for several fundamental reasons which we are going to discuss , extra fields might be necessary to describe the gravitation , scalar fields or higher - order corrections in curvature invariants . +",
    "two sets of equations can be distinguished @xcite .",
    "the first ones couple the gravitational fields to the non  gravitational contents of the universe , the matter distribution , the electromagnetic fields , etc ... the second set of equations gives the evolution of non  gravitational fields . within the framework of metric theories ,",
    "these laws depend only on the metric : this is a consequence of the eep and the so - called `` minimal coupling '' . in most theories , including gr , the second set of equations is derived from the first one , which is the only fundamental one ; however , in many situations , the two sets are decoupled .",
    "+ the gravitational field studied in these approaches ( without cosmological considerations ) is mainly due to the sun and the eddington - robertson expansion gives the corresponding metric . assuming spherical symmetry and a static gravitational field",
    ", one can prove that there exists a coordinate system ( called _ isotropic _ ) such as    d s^2 = b(r ) dt^2 - a(r ) r^2 - ( dr^2 ^2 d^2 + d^2 ) .",
    "@xmath18 being the proper time between two neighboring events . + the newtonian gravitational field does not exceed @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the speed of light , @xmath21 is the mass of the sun and @xmath22 its radius .",
    "the metric is quasi - minkowskian , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are dimensionless functions which depend only on @xmath11 , @xmath4 , @xmath20 and @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , the only pure number that can be built with these four quantities is @xmath25 .",
    "the eddington - robertson metric is a taylor expansion of @xmath26 and @xmath27 which gives    d s^2 & = & ( 1- 2 + 2 ( ) ^2 + ... ) dt^2 + + & - & ( 1- 2 + ... ) r^2 ( dr^2 ^2 d^2+d^2 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are called the post newtonian parameters and their values depend on the considered theory of gravity : in gr , one has @xmath31 .",
    "the post newtonian parameters can be measured not only in the solar system but also in relativistic binary neutron stars such as @xmath32 . +",
    "a generalization of the previous formalism is known as _",
    "parametrized post - newtonian _",
    "( ppn ) formalism .",
    "comparing metric theories of gravity among them and with experimental results becomes particularly easy if the ppn approximation is used .",
    "the following requirements are needed :    * particles are moving slowly with respect to the speed of light ; * gravitational field is weak and considered as a perturbation of the flat spacetime ; * gravitational field is also static , it does not change with time .",
    "the ppn limit of metric theories of gravity is characterized by a set of 10 real - valued parameters ; each metric theory of gravity corresponds to particular values of ppn parameters .",
    "the ppn framework has been used first for the analysis of solar system gravitational experiments , then for the definition and the analysis of new tests of gravitation theory and finally for the analysis and the classification of alternative metric theories of gravity .",
    "+ by the middle 1970 s , the solar system was no more considered as the unique testing ground of gravitation theories .",
    "many alternative theories of gravity agree with gr in the post - newtonian limit and thus with solar system experiments ; nevertheless , they do not agree for other predictions ( such as cosmology , neutron stars , black holes and gravitational radiation ) for which the post - newtonian limit is not adequate .",
    "in addition , the possibility that experimental probes , such as gravitational radiation detectors , would be available in the future to perform extra - solar system tests led to the abandon of the solar system as the only arena to test gravitation theories .",
    "+ the study of the binary pulsar @xmath32 , discovered by r. hulse and j. taylor @xcite , showed that this system combines large post - newtonian gravitational effects , highly relativistic gravitational fields ( associated with the pulsar ) with the evidence of an emission of gravitational radiation ( by the binary system itself ) .",
    "relativistic gravitational effects allowed one to do accurate measurements of astrophysical parameters of the system , such as the mass of the two neutron stars .",
    "the measurement of the orbital period rate of change agreed with the prediction of the gravitational waves ( gw ) emission in the gr framework , in contradiction with the predictions of most alternative theories , even those with ppn limits identical to gr .",
    "however , the evidence was not conclusive to rule out other theories since several shortcomings remain , up to now , unexplained .",
    "gr is currently the most successful relativistic theory of gravitation , introduced by a. einstein @xcite in 1915 to include in a natural way the ep and sr theory ( 1905 ) .",
    "einstein s derivation of gr has been driven by theoretical criteria of elegance and simplicity , not involving neither experimental nor observational results . nevertheless , he had soon to compare his theory with experimental tests .",
    "three important ones confirmed gr : @xmath33 the anomalous perihelion of mercury ( 1915 ) @xcite ; @xmath34 the deflection of light by the sun ( 1919 ) @xcite ; @xmath35 the gravitational red - shift of light  measured by pound - rebka experiment ( 1960 ) @xcite .",
    "gr is a metric theory where the metric tensor is the only gravitational field @xcite .",
    "the einstein tensor @xmath36 is defined as    = r- r    with @xmath37 being the ricci tensor computed by contracting the riemann tensor @xmath38 and @xmath39 the curvature scalar .",
    "the einstein tensor is symmetric thanks to the features of ricci and metric tensors .",
    "it verifies the bianchi identity @xmath40 . the second term in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tens_eins ] ) is divergence - free as the stress - energy tensor @xmath41 because of the conservation of energy - momentum .",
    "+ einstein equations present , in a formal way , the fundamental relation characterizing the spacetime description of gr : _ matter curves spacetime around it_. + such a relation connects two 4-dimensional symmetric tensors of rank 2 , through a proportionality relation : the einstein tensor @xmath36 , defined above as a contraction of the riemann tensor @xmath42 , describing the curvature of a generic manifold , and the stress - energy tensor @xmath41 which contains densities and energy - momentum fluxes .",
    "this tensor depends on all possible types of energy ( kinetic , potential , pressure , etc ... ) and also on gravitational field energy",
    ". therefore , einstein equations are non - linear since gravity terms appear on both sides ( source and effect ) .",
    "+ einstein equations can be obtained in two different ways .",
    "the first one is the natural covariant generalization of poisson equation for the newtonian gravitational potential , = t = .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath43 is computed by assuming the convergence to the newtonian theory of gravity in the limit of weak , time ",
    "independent gravitational fields and slow motions .",
    "+ einstein equations are non - linear second - order differential equations ; there are ten independent equations since both sides are two - index symmetric tensors ( the solution consists in computing the ten unknown functions of the metric components ) ; nevertheless , the bianchi identities give four additional constraints on @xmath37 , so there are only six independent relations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : einstein ] ) .",
    "it is not possible to solve these equations in general , but even particular solutions , like the ones in vacuum , are difficult to compute without some simplifying assumptions .",
    "+ the second way to derive einstein equations comes from the variation of the action principle where the curvature scalar invariant @xmath44 is considered .",
    "the gr action is the hilbert - einstein action @xcite    = -    linear in the ricci curvature scalar @xmath44 , minimally coupled , being the gravitational coupling the constant @xmath11 , where @xmath45 is the metric determinant and @xmath46 is the perfect - fluid matter lagrangian density .    assuming spherical symmetry ",
    "( [ eq : isotropic ] )  there are standard coordinates such that    d s^2 = e^ dt^2 - e^ dr^2 -r^2 ( ^2 d^2 + d^2 )    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are two functions of @xmath49 and @xmath12 only .",
    "+ the solution of the einstein equations in vacuum is    e^ = e^- f(t ) e^=    where @xmath50 is an arbitrary positive function of @xmath49 and @xmath51 is a constant .",
    "the metric is time ",
    "independent : this is the birkhoff s theorem . for instance , it states that the explosion of a supernova does not produce any time dependent modification of spacetime if it is a spherically symmetric explosion , there is no gw production .",
    "+ let us assume that the source of gravitational field is a mass located at the origin @xmath52 .",
    "in order to recover the newtonian limit far away from the origin , one must assume @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding solution is called the `` schwarzschild solution '' ( in standard coordinates )    d s^2 = b(r ) dt^2 - - r^2 ( ^2 d^2+d^2 ) b(r ) = 1 -    where @xmath4 is the mass of the central body .",
    "+ generally , the schwarzschild radius of the central mass , @xmath54 , is much smaller than the physical radius @xmath55 of the body itself .",
    "therefore the solution ( [ eq : solution_schwarzschild ] ) is only valid in a region where @xmath56 .",
    "however , one can also consider a compact object with @xmath57 ; in that case the surface @xmath58 separates the spacetime into two regions .",
    "such a compact object is called a schwarzschild black hole . in the exterior region , where @xmath59 , the coordinates @xmath49 and @xmath12 are respectively time ",
    "like and space  like ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "when a light source approaches the surface @xmath58 , the einstein gravitational shift becomes so huge that the frequency of the light becomes zero everywhere ; the photons loose their energy and can not be seen anymore .",
    "the surface @xmath58 is the last surface that can be seen from outside and it is thus called the `` horizon '' . in the interior region , where @xmath62 one has @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; it means that @xmath49 is a space  like coordinate while @xmath12 is a time  like coordinate .      replacing the newtonian limit by a less restrictive hypothesis leads to the weak field approximation : practically , the field is still weak , but it is allowed to change in time and there is no more restriction on the test particles motion .",
    "new phenomena are associated with this hypothesis like the emission of gravitational radiation and the deflection of light .",
    "this framework allows one to split the metric @xmath17 into two parts : the flat minkowski metric @xmath65 plus a perturbative term @xmath66 , assumed to be small .",
    "this linearized version of gr describes the propagation of a symmetric tensor @xmath66 on a flat background spacetime .",
    "so , the metric reads    = + || 1 .",
    "as @xmath67 is small , one can neglect terms higher than the first order in the perturbation @xmath66 ; in particular , one can raise / lower indexes with @xmath68 and @xmath69 as the corrections are of higher order in the perturbation    = - h= ^^ h _ .",
    "the aim is to find the equations of motion to which the perturbations @xmath66 obey by investigating the einstein equations to the first order . inserting the new metric ( [ eq : metr_decomp ] ) in the einstein tensor",
    ", we obtain = ( _ _ h^ _ + _ _ h^ _ - _ _ h - - _ _ h^ + h )    where @xmath70 is the trace of the perturbation and @xmath71 is the dalembertian of the flat spacetime , using from now on ( unless otherwise stated ) geometrical units for which @xmath72 . + the stress - energy tensor is computed at the 0-order in @xmath66 : the energy and the momentum have to be small too , according to the weak field approximation and the lowest non - vanishing order in @xmath41 is of the same order of magnitude as the perturbation .",
    "therefore , the conservation law becomes @xmath73 .",
    "gw are weak ripples in the curvature of spacetime , produced by the motions of matter .",
    "they propagate at the speed of light .",
    "the linearized einstein equations allow wave solutions , in a way similar to electromagnetism .",
    "these gw are transverse to the propagation direction and show two independent polarization states .",
    "+ the new metric ( [ eq : metr_decomp ] ) does not fix the spacetime frame completely ; two possible gauges can be applied in addition to simplify the einstein equations . using the lorentz gauge @xmath74 ,",
    "the einstein equations ( [ eq : einstein ] ) are linearized and can be written as    - h = t .",
    "the trace - reversed perturbation is defined as        one can choose a frame in which the harmonic gauge condition , @xmath75 is verified .",

    "( [ eq : vacuum_sol ] ) is a solution of the linearized equations in vacuum ",
    "( [ eq : vacuum ] )  if the wave vector @xmath79 is null , satisfies the condition @xmath80 and shows that gw propagate to the speed of light . + the four conditions of the harmonic gauge @xmath81 lead to six independent components for the symmetric tensor @xmath78 .",

    "<S> newtonian limit of extended theories of gravity ( in particular , higher  order and scalar  tensor theories ) is theoretically discussed taking into account recent observational and experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> extended theories of gravity have become a sort of paradigm in the study of gravitational interaction since several motivations push for enlarging the traditional scheme of einstein general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> such issues come , essentially , from cosmology and quantum field theory . in the first case </S>",
    "<S> , it is well known that higher  derivative theories and scalar  tensor theories furnish inflationary cosmological solutions capable , in principle , of solving the shortcomings of the standard cosmological model . </S>",
    "<S> besides , they have relevant features also from the quantum cosmology viewpoint . in the second case , </S>",
    "<S> every unification scheme as superstrings , supergravity or grand unified theories , takes into account effective actions where nonminimal couplings to the geometry or higher  order terms in the curvature invariants come out . </S>",
    "<S> such contributions are due to one  loop or higher  loop corrections in the high  curvature regimes near the full ( not yet available ) quantum gravity regime . in the weak  </S>",
    "<S> limit approximation , all these classes of theories should be expected to reproduce the einstein general relativity which , in any case , is experimentally tested only in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is matter of debate since several relativistic theories do not reproduce the einstein results in the newtonian approximation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , some authors claim for explaining the flat rotation curves of galaxies by yukawa  like corrections to the newtonian potential arising in this context . </S>",
    "<S> others have shown that a conformal theory of gravity could explain the missing matter problem . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , indications of an apparent , anomalous , long  range acceleration revealed from the data analysis of pioneer 10/11 , galileo , and ulysses spacecrafts could be framed in a general theoretical scheme by taking into account yukawa  like or higher  order corrections to the newtonian potential . </S>",
    "<S> such data will be very likely capable of confirming or ruling out the physical consistency of extended theories of gravity .    </S>",
