    "the transmission of multiply and highly charged ions ( hci ) through nanocapillaries has recently been employed as a tool to study the interaction with surfaces , specifically , the internal walls of the capillary . the original motivation was to delineate the initial state of hollow - atom formation at large distances from the surface @xcite information hardly accessible by scattering at flat surfaces .",
    "image attraction and close collisions tend to erase the memory on this early state of ion - surface interaction when the ion suffers close encounter as it is either reflected from the topmost layer of the surface or penetrates into the bulk . a previous first step to",

    "capillaries provided an attractive alternative as the ion can escape the capillary prior to a close encounter with the surface , the hollow atom can be directly spectroscopically investigated @xcite .",
    "initial investigations focused on metallic capillaries with typical radii of @xmath0 = 50 to 100 nm ( `` nanocapillaries '' ) and a length @xmath1 of about one @xmath2 m , thus featuring an aspect ratio of the order of 1:20 and geometric opening angles @xmath3 . incidence angles @xmath4 larger than @xmath5 therefore necessarily lead to the impact of all projectiles on the surface and , consequently , to the destruction of the hollow atom ( or hollow ion ) .",

    ", suggests that the ions bounce off the walls at distances larger than the critical distance @xmath10 @xcite : ( @xmath11 : charge state ; @xmath12 : workfunction of capillary ) .",
    "key to this process is the charging up of the internal insulator walls due to preceding ion impacts .",
    "ion guiding through the capillary ensues as soon as a dynamical equilibrium of self - organized charge up by the ion beam , charge relaxation , and reflection is established .",
    "a theoretical description and simulation of this process poses a considerable challenge in view of the widely disparate time scales simultaneously present in this problem :    1 .",
    "the microscopic charge - up and charge hopping due to the impact of individual ion impact takes place on a time scale of sub-@xmath13 to @xmath13 with typical hopping time @xmath14 s. 2 .",
    "the transmission time @xmath15 of a projectile ion through the capillary for typical ion energies of @xmath16 ev / u is of the order of @xmath17 s. 3 .",
    "typical average time intervals @xmath18 between two subsequent transmission ( or impact ) events in the same capillary are , for present experimental current densities of na / mm@xmath19 of the order of @xmath20 s. 4 .   characteristic ( bulk ) discharge times @xmath21 for these highly insulating materials , can be estimated from conductivity data @xcite to typically exceed @xmath22 s and can even reach days .",
    "as this multi - scale problem spans a remarkable 18 orders of magnitude , a fully microscopic ab initio simulation covering all relevant scales is undoubtedly out of reach .",
    "the more modest goal of the present approach is therefore to develop a simulation that allows to interrelate the microscopic description of ion - surface impact with macroscopic properties of charge - up and transport .",
    "aim is therefore to employ in our simulation only parameters that are not freely adjustable but can , at least as far as their order magnitude is concerned , be deduced from data for macroscopic material properties of the nanocapillary material .",
    "specifically , the bulk discharge time @xmath21 as well surface charge diffusion constant @xmath23 will be estimated from surface and bulk conductivity data for mylar @xcite .",
    "the present approach represent a mean - field classical transport theory @xcite based on a microscopic classical - trajectory monte carlo ( ctmc ) simulation for the ion transported , self - consistently coupled to the charge - up of and charge diffusion near the internal capillary walls . as a limiting case",
    "we also consider a simplified rate - equation approach .",
    "we find partial agreement with experimental data .",
    "we conclude this paper by pointing to future experimental and theoretical challenges to be overcome .",
    "the simulations presented below incorporate the features of the following underlying scenario : an ensemble of ions of charge state @xmath11 are incident relative to the surface normal of the nanocapillary foil with angle @xmath4 .",
    "the axis of the capillary with radius @xmath24 is assumed to be either aligned with the surface normal ( fig .  [ schema ] ) or gaussian distributed around the orientation of the normal with width @xmath25 .",
    "the lateral inter - capillary spacing @xmath26 is of the order of @xmath27 such that , on an atomic level , inter - capillary interaction effects can be neglected .",
    "mesoscopic field effects resulting from the charge - up of the ensemble of capillaries will , however , be taken into account .",
    "the entrance and exit surfaces are covered by a @xmath28 nm metallic gold layer in order to avoid macroscopic charge - up of the capillary foil .",
    "the insulating material on the inside is characterized by a dielectric constant @xmath29 . in view of the low projectile velocities @xmath30 for which guiding is studied , @xmath31 a.u . , the static limit @xmath32 of the dielectric function @xmath33 is appropriate to characterize the linear response .",
    "about 4  % of the entrance surface is covered by capillary openings .",
    "typical current densities are @xmath34 na / mm@xmath19 and the beam spot size is of the order of @xmath34 mm@xmath19 simultaneously illuminating @xmath35 adjacent nanocapillaries .",
    "ions entering the nanocapillary will be attracted by the image field @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the distance to the capillary wall .",
    "therefore , even ions entering the capillary with angles @xmath4 smaller than the geometric aspect ratio @xmath38 , @xmath39 will eventually experience close encounters with the surface .",
    "therefore , the effective angle for transmission would be smaller than given by eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] , unless guiding effects become operational .",
    "ions reaching the surface will undergo a charge transfer sequence yielding a neutralized projectile and deposite a number @xmath40 of positive charges with @xmath41 at the surface .",
    "in our simulation , we use @xmath42 for the microscopic charge up per ion impact at the capillary wall above all because the secondary electron emission coefficient @xmath43 for impact of slow ions at insulator surfaces is small @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "we have , however , tested the influence of larger @xmath43 by performing simulations in which up to @xmath45 positive charges and @xmath11 electrons with energies up to 50 ev were produced .",
    "trajectories of the latter were followed and these electrons were allowed to neutralize positive charges on the capillary wall .",
    "no significant differences between simulations for different @xmath43 could be found .",
    "the charged - up micro - patch will undergo surface diffusion with diffusion constant @xmath23 as well diffusion into the bulk with diffusion constant @xmath46 .",
    "bulk diffusion is extremely slow for highly insulating materials while the surface diffusion towards the grounded metallic layers will be a factor @xmath47 faster , thus governing the overall discharge process .",
    "self - organized guiding sets in when a dynamical equilibrium between charge - up by a series of ion impacts at internal walls with an average frequency @xmath48 hz and the charge diffusion is established such that the electrostatic repulsion prevents further impacts .",
    "the ion is reflected at distances from the wall larger than the critical distances from the surface for electron capture @xcite , @xmath49 the wall forms then an effective mesoscopic `` trampoline '' for subsequent ions and guides the projectile towards the exit .",
    "we consider the propagation of @xmath50 ions through @xmath51 nanocapillaries .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath52 ionic trajectory through the @xmath53 capillary proceeds by solving hamilton s equation of motion @xmath54 with random initial conditions subject to the energy constraint @xmath55 the non - trivial aspect of this classical - trajectory monte carlo simulation is that memory effects must be built into the potential @xmath56 ( eq .  [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "the force experienced by the @xmath52 ion depends on the history of all previous trajectories @xmath57 through the same @xmath58 capillary as well as on the ensemble of neighboring charged - up capillaries @xmath59 via the mean field @xmath60 .",
    "it furthermore depends on the surface and bulk diffusion constants @xmath61 of the material . by deducing values for @xmath61 from macroscopic conductivity data and considering them to be independent from the stage of charge - up ,",
    "we treat the discharge process in linear response , i.e.  we neglect non - linear processes discussed recently @xcite . details of the determination of @xmath56 will be discussed below .    solving eqs .",
    "[ eq:4 ] and [ eq:5 ] is , while straight - forward in principle , quite demanding in view of the disparate time scales and ensemble sizes involved .",
    "we have therefore developed an algorithm that approaches the accuracy of conventional runge - kutta methods while considerably increasing the computing efficiency .",
    "first , the capillary is divided into three - sided prisms which are further subdivided into three tetrahedrons ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the force ( eq .  [ eq:5 ] ) is calculated before the simulation of a given trajectory only at the corners of the tetrahedrons .",
    "the starting point of the trajectory is determined from a uniform probability distribution over the entrance surface of the capillary , the entrance angle @xmath4 is selected from a gaussian distribution centered around the nominal entrance angle .",
    "its full width at half maximum ( fwhm @xmath62 ) was taken from experimental parameters @xcite .",
    "the propagation is calculated in three steps : first , the point of entrance into a tetrahedron is determined .",
    "next , the average electric field calculated from the potential ( eq .  [ eq:5 ] ) in this structure is determined and , as the last step , the exit point is derived from the _ analytical _ propagation of the trajectory within the tetrahedron .",
    "this exit point becomes the starting point of the trajectory within the next tetrahedron and so forth ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . from comparison between our method and a fourth - order runge - kutta simulation",
    "we have determined the optimal size of the tetrahedrons .",
    "we find a significant speed - up ( up to a factor 100 ) while preserving accuracy to a good degree of approximation .",
    "the propagation of the trajectory is stopped if one of the following two requirements is met : either the projectile reaches the exit surface of the capillary at which point the exit angle for this trajectory is calculated and the transmission probability of the ensemble is updated or the trajectory is not sufficiently deflected by the field of surface charges and hits the surface .",
    "the point of impact is determined and serves as starting point of the simultaneously performed calculation of the charge diffusion .",
    "diffusion of the deposited @xmath11 charges is determined for a time interval @xmath63 between two the subsequent trajectories @xmath64 enter the same capillary @xmath65 .",
    "we have performed simulations both for poissonian distributed intervals with mean @xmath18 as well as for fixed intervals @xmath66 .",
    "the results are indistinguishable which is not surprising as @xmath18 is 9 orders of magnitude larger than @xmath15 .",

    "we use @xmath80 m@xmath19s@xmath73 and @xmath81 unless otherwise stated .",
    "the disparity of surface and bulk diffusion will be key for the understanding of the charge - up and discharge characteristics .",
    "the point to be noted is that for such low conductivities and large uncertainties in the effective number of carriers present , eq .",
    "[ eq:8 ] can only serve for an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "we will later check on the consistency of these estimates by comparison with results of our simulation .",
    "after deposition of @xmath11 charges per impact , charges are assumed to undergo an unbiased random walk resulting in the diffusive spread of the charges . for simplicity and to avoid the introduction of any free parameter , modification of the random walk by mutual coulomb repulsion is neglected .",
    "accordingly , the probability distribution for the charge distribution in the surface a time interval @xmath63 after impact is given by @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the distance on the surface .",
    "likewise , the distribution for bulk diffusion in 3d is given by @xmath84 with @xmath85 the distance in 3d . since surface diffusion is much faster and",
    "effectively controls the discharging at the boundary to the metallic layer , we treat surface diffusion explicitly using eq .",
    "by contrast , we simulate bulk diffusion after the random walk into the bulk by a switch - off of the charge with a time constant @xmath21 estimated from @xmath46 as @xmath86 where we use as characteristic hopping length @xmath87 into the bulk half of the mean inter - capillary distance ( i.e.  @xmath88 @xcite ) .",

    "finally , the mean field @xmath71 takes into account collective field effects of an entire ensemble of nanocapillaries approximately @xmath97 of which are located within the beam spot . as they get simultaneously charged - up , they generate a mesoscopic electric field that is aligned along the capillary axis . due to the large distance of the charge patches near the entry side from the exit surface ( @xmath98",
    "m ) the ensemble can be viewed as a charged condenser consisting of two metallic plates ( the gold layers ) with a dielectric material characterized by the dielectric constant @xmath99 in between ( fig .",

    "the bottleneck condition was realized by setting @xmath23 to be equal to the bulk values of @xmath46 , corresponding to a slow overall discharge time set here to be @xmath111 min .",
    "in fact , such a slow discharge time has been suggested by experiment @xcite for the time interval over which recharging after beam switch - off could be realized . only in the simultaneous presence of both fast ( via surface transport , @xmath23 ) and slow decay ( via bulk transport @xmath46 )",
    "can guiding be established and maintained .",
    "when taking into account both surface and bulk diffusion , assumptions about a non - linear discharging characteristics @xcite need not to be invoked .",
    "the resulting transmission probability as a function of the angle of incidence relative to the capillary axis ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) displays significant transmission for angles well outside the geometric opening angle @xmath5 .",
    "the quantitative agreement with the experimental transmission function is reasonably good considering the discrepancies between different data sets .",
    "the latter is , in part , due to the extraordinarily long bulk discharge times ( from @xmath46 estimated to be in the range of hours ) which makes measurements under reproducible conditions of complete initial discharge a challenge .      the two - dimensional angular distribution of the guided ions displays anisotropic structures ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) in the @xmath112@xmath113 plane where @xmath112 is the angle relative to the capillary axis in the `` scattering plane '' , the plane spanned by the incident velocity vector and the capillary axis while @xmath114 is the angle perpendicular to the scattering plane .",

    "[ fig6 ] ) become visible which qualitatively agrees with recent experimental findings @xcite . from the simulation we can delineate the origin of the second maximum as being due to the formation of a small secondary charge patch close to the exit surface which deflects projectiles passing by at close distance .",
    "we point out that double peak structures are stable under variation of @xmath23 and the capillary length @xmath1 although they appear at different angles @xmath4 .",

    "limited by the dc dielectric break - down strength of mylar , the defocussing effect of @xmath100 on the total spread @xmath9 should not exceed @xmath121 .",

    "the dynamical equilibrium necessary for guiding takes a finite time interval determined by the incoming ion current density and diffusion speed . studying the transient behavior as the ion beam",

    "it is probed by first switching off the ion    beam at @xmath128 and switching it on again after a time interval @xmath129 for a sufficiently short time interval in order not to disturb the discharge process .",
    "data points are normalized to the transition rate at @xmath128 and represent an average transmission over 10 capillaries .    the charging and discharging behavior can be described in terms of a simple analytic rate equation model which is a generalization of the model proposed in @xcite . to this end",
