    "in 1986 paczyski ( @xcite ) suggested that photometric observations of gravitational microlensing might be used to indirectly study the population of massive compact objects in the galaxy , and in particular massive compact halo objects ( machos ) that might be a significant component of the dark matter thought to exist in the galaxy by dynamical considerations .",
    "paczyski s 1986 paper , and the observational proposals it fostered were met with some skepticism .",
    "however , the past several years have seen paczyski s suggestion spectacularly confirmed  at the time of this writing four separate groups have reported significant numbers of candidate gravitational microlensing events from photometric observations of lmc , smc , and galactic bulge sources .",
    "the large majority of the light curves for these candidate microlensing events match theoretical expectations for single lens objects , and all collaborations report a significant excess of microlensing event candidates above the number expected from known stellar populations .",
    "in particular , from their first two years of data the macho collaboration reports eight events toward the lmc where only one is expected from known stellar populations , and estimates that roughly half of the expected dark matter in the galactic halo is in the form of dark stellar mass objects ( @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulty in interpreting the macho collaboration events is that they are observed photometrically , which does not uniquely determine the mass of the lens ",
    "instead the macho collaboration bases their conclusions on interpreting their event sample observables ( namely event duration ) in the context of a halo model ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , other interpretations are possible ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for recent work arguing against a halo interpretation ) .",
    "clearly it is desirable to measure macho physical properties in a model - free context .",
    "this objective has led a number of authors to propose the astrometric observation of macho gravitational microlensing events ( @xcite ) , a specialized application of an earlier suggestion by hosokawa et al ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , miyamoto and yoshi proposed the separate astrometric observation of both lensing images in macho microlensing events ( a small misuse of the term microlensing ",
    "see @xcite ) , and developed the theory of such astrometry . as we shall argue below , we find this suggestion implausible because of the small separation of the images . instead ,",
    "herein we consider astrometry of the lensed center - of - light , primarily for dark lenses .",
    "we find , as did miyamoto and yoshi , that high - precision astrometric observation of such microlensing events allows the estimation of the lens parameters ( mass , distance , proper motion ) appealing only to the properties of lensing .",
    "moreover , we find that in a limited set of circumstances , the problem of determining a subset the lens parameters ( mass , relative parallax , relative proper motion ) is amenable to narrow - angle differential astrometric techniques very similar to those proposed and employed in gravitational companion search programs ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular we argue that if a suitable astrometric reference frame can be established , the lens mass can be directly measured by ground - based differential astrometric techniques independent of additional assumptions , and the lens distance and transverse velocity can be estimated by appealing to an independent model of source distance and proper motion ( see similar remarks by @xcite ) . in such circumstances ,",
    "many of the current issues regarding the nature of the lensing objects can be resolved .    in this paper",
    "we assess the ability of astrometry to probe the physical parameters of microlensing events in which the lens is dark , with a particular emphasis on macho microlensing events . in ",
    "[ sec : microlensing_theory ] we introduce the theory to analyze a microlensing encounter as observed by a ( near ) terrestrial instrument , in terms particularly oriented toward narrow - angle differential astrometry . in ",
    "[ sec : astrometric_observations ] we address astrometric sensitivity to microlensing parameters through monte carlo techniques . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we place our results in the context of envisioned astrometric instrumentation , discuss the near term prospects for such an astrometric program , and mention future extensions to this work .",
    "as quantitatively described by refsdal ( @xcite ) and recently reviewed by paczyski ( @xcite ) , a gravitational lensing event is photometrically observable when an intervening compact massive object passes close to the line - of - sight to a background source .",
    "this phenomenon follows from the curvature of space near a massive object .",
    "general relativity predicts that an object of mass @xmath0 deflects a light ray by an angle @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the  impact parameter \" ( transverse separation at the point of closest approach ) of the light ray relative to the mass position . in this way the mass acts as an optical lens .",
    "the instantaneous geometry of a background source lensed by an intervening point mass ( the lens ) is depicted in figures 1 and 2 of @xcite .",
    "when the lens is sufficiently close to the nominal line - of - sight to the background source , an observer ( equipped with a telescope of arbitrarily high angular resolution ) sees a background disk - like source as two arcs at distinct positions @xmath4 , corresponding to two solutions of a quadratic equation in the bend angles @xmath5  on opposite sides of the lens . in a plane normal to the unperturbed line - of - sight to the source containing the lens ( herein referred to as the transverse lens plane ) ,",
    "the apparent positions of the two arcs are at impact parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 relative to the lens , functions of the impact parameter of the unperturbed line - of - sight to the source @xmath8 relative to the lens : @xmath9 where all the impact parameters are positive semi - definite quantities , the subscript 1 refers to the positive quadratic root  the brighter of the two images and the closest to the source ( in contrast to @xcite ) , @xmath10 is the so - called einstein radius : @xmath11 and we have introduced a dimensionless impact parameter @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the source - lens , lens - observer , and source - observer distances , respectively , and @xmath16 is the fractional separation @xmath17 .",
    "the two images appear separated in the transverse lens plane by : @xmath18    the intensities of the two images can be computed from the fact that any lensing conserves surface brightness . for imperfect lens alignment and constant surface brightness of the source the relative brightness between the arcs and source",
    "is given by the ratio of perturbed and unperturbed image surface areas in the transverse lens plane of @xcite figure 2 .",
    "the relative intensities ( units of the unperturbed source intensity ) of the two images of a quasi - point source are easily shown to be ( @xcite ) : @xmath19    if we consider lensing of lmc , smc , or bulge stars by intervening star - like compact masses , then what we observe is limited by the finite resolution of our instrumentation .",
    "in particular , for @xmath20 m@xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) we find a value of @xmath24 ( hence @xmath25 ) that is a few au . for a lens distance on the order of kiloparsecs , that makes the images separated by an angle on the order of a milliarcsecond ( mas  @xmath26 arcseconds ) .",
    "this image separation is well below the angular resolution of available instrumentation , so an observer sees the lensed images of the source as unresolved and of total amplitude ( @xcite ) : @xmath27 the fact that the source images are unresolved qualifies this event as _ micro_lensing ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath28 is significantly greater than one only for @xmath29 less than one ( figure [ fig : pos_and_amp ] ) , so the unperturbed source line - of - sight must be within the lens einstein radius before significant photometric amplification is observed . figure  [ fig : pos_and_amp ] gives the image positions and amplitudes as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "note also that the photometric amplification of a quasi - point source by a dark lens is achromatic  a fact that is exploited in photometric microlensing searches .",
    "[ [ center - of - light ] ] center - of - light + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    even though the two microlensing images are ( by definition ) unresolved , they are spatially distinct from the nominal source position ( eq .",
    "[ eq : positions ] ) , and have non - trivial intensities ( eq .",
    "[ eq : amplitudes ] ) .",
    "we therefore consider astrometry of the center - of - light position in the instance of microlensing , which can be performed at several orders of magnitude below imaging resolution limits ( for examples see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "as can be seen from @xcite figure 2 , the center - of - light is clearly on the symmetry axis between the source and lens .",
    "additionally , the lens is in general luminous , and probably unresolved from the images of the background source .",
    "if we parameterize the relative lens brightness @xmath30 ( in general a function of wavelength ) in units of the unlensed source brightness , relative to the nominal _ source _ position , the center - of - light is located at : @xmath31 where we have written the expression to identify the multiplicative correction ( and approximation expanded to leading order ) to the dark - lens results as a function of @xmath30 ; in the limit that the lens is dark the expressions simplify to the quantities external to the braces . this center - of - light position for a dark lens is included in figure  [ fig : pos_and_amp ] as a function of @xmath29 . the observable astrometric displacement of the center - of - light from the nominal source position is ( @xcite all give the dark - lens form ) : @xmath32 where we have introduced the angular einstein radius @xmath33 / @xmath14 , and again explicitly indicated the dark - lens result and correction ( and approximation to leading order in @xmath30 ) due to a luminous lens . in what follows",
    "we will assume a dark lens , but will briefly revisit the instance of a luminous lens in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "assuming a dark lens , in the microlensing situation described above @xmath34 o@xmath35 is on the order of a milliarcsecond  a value that is within current and envisioned astrometric capabilities of ground - based optical interferometers ( palomar testbed interferometer ",

    "it is noteworthy that this astrometric perturbation signature is at a maximum for @xmath36 , and has a value of 2@xmath37 0.35 @xmath38 .",
    "note also that this perturbation is positive ( semi-)definite  the apparent center - of - light is always displaced away from the lens .",
    "finally , as in the case of the photometric amplification of a quasi - point source , the astrometric displacement is achromatic in the limit of a dark lens , but in general is a function of wavelength if the lens is luminous .      the geometry of a typical , simple microlensing encounter observed in a barycentric ( inertial ) system is depicted in figure [ fig : lens_geom3 ] .",
    "the source , lens , and observer are taken as free to move linearly on the time scale of the lensing event .",
    "consequently , viewed in a plane containing the lens and normal to the unperturbed source line - of - sight , the relative source - lens trajectory is approximately linear during the encounter . without loss of generality",

    "tab : mc_cases ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure [ fig : masserr ] shows the variation of fractional lens mass error vs.  astrometric error for three illustrative cases : @xmath38 = 100 @xmath62as , @xmath79 = 50 @xmath62as ( @xmath0 = 0.02 m@xmath21 ) ; @xmath38 = 300 @xmath62as , @xmath79 = 100 @xmath62as ( @xmath0 = 0.1 m@xmath21 ) ; and @xmath38 = 1000 @xmath62as , @xmath79 = 200 @xmath62as ( @xmath0 = 0.6 m@xmath21 ) . in each of these cases",
    "@xmath53 = 0.4 and @xmath65 = 0.1 yr . here the lens mass error is estimated from the observed uncertainties ( residual sample standard deviations ) in @xmath38 and @xmath79 ( and the generally nonzero covariance ) .",
    "this behavior is suggestive that the mass error scales by a power law of the astrometric error  we find these cases to be typical of the range of monte carlo cases considered .",
    "ignoring the correlation term , we can estimate the fractional mass error as a function of the fractional errors in @xmath38 and @xmath79 from eq .",
    "[ eq : lens_mass ] : @xmath92 where the second equality comes from crudely estimating the uncertainties in @xmath85 and @xmath79 by @xmath93 .",
    "figure [ fig : massscatter ] shows a scatter plot of the observed fractional mass error from all 384 of our monte carlo cases against the estimated fractional error given by eq .  [ eq : mass_err_est ] .",
    "the agreement between the observed and estimated quantities is good , but we find eq .",
    "[ eq : mass_err_est ] overestimates the fractional error at large values of @xmath93 .",
    "a power - law fit to the data indicates that the observed error scales as the estimate in eq .",
    "[ eq : mass_err_est ] ( hence @xmath93 ) to the 0.9 power .",
    "we attribute this modest sub - linear scaling to the fact that astrometric fits supported by associated photometry resolve @xmath38 and @xmath79 slightly better than the naive estimate of @xmath93 .",
    "we attribute the observed scatter in the data to the correlation terms which are included in the observed error estimates , but are neglected in eq .",
    "[ eq : mass_err_est ] .",
    "we also note that the @xmath65 = 0.2 yr cases on average have lower observed error and smaller scatter than the corresponding @xmath65 = 0.1 yr cases .",
    "this is not particularly surprising , as the slower time evolution allows for extended observation of the relative parallactic effects .",
    "finally , we have argued for and simulated differential astrometric experiments where we assume astrometry in a frame where the source is stationary .",
    "this reference frame must be established by observing field objects near the nominal source position .",
    "for lmc , smc , and bulge events where there are many objects at small @xmath94 with the source , the reference frame will absorb common parallactic motions",
    ". however , there will be residual frame drifts and rotations resulting from unknown velocity dispersion among the reference objects ( and source ) .",
    "the residual linear frame drifts are large ( mas yr@xmath88 ) on the scale of the microlensing astrometric excursion .",
    "the frame rotations will be small ( o(@xmath95 ) rad yr@xmath88 ) , but to the extent that the source is not at the center of the astrometric frame this too adds an effective linear drift to the differential frame of order 100 @xmath62as yr@xmath88 . so in practice the microlensing fit process must account for linear frame drifts that are large compared with the scale of the microlensing excursion .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the microlensing parameter model to include a frame drift .",
    "figure [ fig : framedrift ] gives an example of allowing for a random drift in the astrometric frame , and using an extended microlensing model to solve for this quantity .",
    "the physical parameters of the microlensing event in figure [ fig : framedrift ] are the same as those used in figure [ fig : model_fitting ] : @xmath38 = 300 @xmath62as , @xmath79 = 100 @xmath62as , @xmath65 = 0.1 yr ; and we have taken 50 @xmath62as astrometry .",
    "to this we have added 1.5 mas yr@xmath88 of frame drift in a random orientation to the lens motion .",
    "the microlensing fit does an acceptable job of identifying the frame drift , bolstered by the time base of astrometry at late encounter times ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "we do not find a coupling between frame drift and the quantities of interest in determining the lens mass : @xmath38 and @xmath79 .",
    "we have added random frame drifts to several of the monte carlo cases described in table [ tab : mc_cases ] , and find that such drifts do not significantly effect our simulation results .",
    "this is reasonable , as both @xmath38 and @xmath79 are estimated from the curvature of the astrometric path .",
    "we have specialized the miyamoto and yoshi suggestion to measure the astrometry of the lensing event photocenter .",
    "we agree with their conclusions : that high - precision astrometric observation of macho microlensing events hold the promise of determining fundamental lens parameters ( mass , proper motion , transverse velocity ) in a model - independent fashion .",
    "we maintain that it is sufficient to measure the motion of the center - of - light .",
    "in particular , in many cases accurate differential astrometry is sufficient obtain the lens mass without additional assumptions ( in slight contrast to the earlier suggestion by @xcite , who ignored the value of parallactic effects ) , and reasonable lens distance and transverse velocity estimates can be obtained from an independent model of source distance and proper motion .",
    "such narrow - angle differential astrometry is possible from the ground ( @xcite ) . alternatively",
    ", wide - angle microarcsecond - class astrometry can simultaneously determine the source and lens position and kinematic parameters without external information , and again the lens mass .",
    "clearly the potential for probing the physical parameters of the putative halo object population by astrometric techniques is enormous .",
    "a program to probe microlensing events photometrically detected in the galactic bulge seems plausible for the planned keck interferometer ( ki  @xcite ) .",
    "ki requires a bright guide star to track atmospheric fluctuations of the interferometric fringes .",
    "the brightest bulge objects are 16th magnitude , within the fringe tracking capabilities for the two 10 m apertures . the expected 10  20 @xmath62as astrometric performance of ki yields microlensing parameter estimates sufficient to constrain lens mass and distance parameters for individual events , which will give profound insight into the nature of these objects .",
    "however , events in the lmc or smc are not detectable from the keck site , both because of geography and sensitivity .",
    "the brightest objects in the lmc are 1718 magnitude , arguably fainter than the tracking capabilities of the ki .",
    "however , the declination of these fields would require ki zenith angles that severely degrade the astrometric performance .",
    "a large aperture astrometric interferometer in the southern hemisphere such as the vlt interferometer ( vlti  @xcite ) could measure magellenic cloud events , and in particular determine the lens mass and distance with sufficient accuracy to resolve many of the current issues regarding their nature .",
    "such measurements would be very challenging but are clearly very compelling .",
    "a number of authors have specifically suggested the application of planned space - based global astrometric techniques to analyze these events ( @xcite ) . in space - based applications",
    "astrometric references can be drawn from a global astrometric frame tied to extragalactic objects , and the positions , proper motions , and parallaxes of these references are known to a few microarcseconds in a quasi - static frame .",
    "thus the necessity of establishing a narrow - angle relative frame for differential astrometry is removed .",
    "further , astrometry at late times identifies the source proper motion and parallax in the global frame  thereby establishing the source motion and distance . with the source distance and kinematics established ,",
    "the lens parameters are all uniquely determined . assuming ground - based observations measure lens masses and distance in the manner we describe , we believe the role of space - based microlensing astrometry programs by planned astrometric space missions such as sim ( @xcite ) and gaia ( @xcite ) will be in probing the precision positions and particularly kinematics of the lensing objects . if ground - based measurements of magelenic cloud events are not possible , then sim and gaia seem well - suited to offer definitive answers on the nature of the lenses .",
    "finally , in the near future it is possible that ccd - based astrometry could make detections of microlensing astrometric perturbations , and possibly make rough estimates of lensing parameters , and/or breaking some of the degeneracies in photometric microlensing observations ( see below ) .",
    "pravdo and shaklan ( @xcite ) report night - to - night astrometric repeatability of 200 @xmath62as in data taken at the palomar 5 m telescope , and speculate that limits might approach 100 @xmath62as at the 10 m keck telescope . in further assessing these prospects we anxiously await the results of several nights of keck observations recently made by pravdo and shaklan ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the key assumptions we have made in this work is the assumption of a dark lens .",
    "this assumption is plausible given the success photometric programs have had in fitting dark lens amplification models to photometric data .",
    "however , the instance of a luminous lens is possible and interesting ( @xcite ) , and the astrometric model derived here can be augmented in a straightforward way .",
    "figure [ fig : llens_fitting ] shows an example of a fit to a dataset generated with a luminous lens model unresolved from the lensed source .",
    "the physical parameters ( bulge event , 10 kps source / 5 kpc lens distance , 0.1 m@xmath21 lens , lens / source brightness ratio of 0.1 ) were selected to be comparable to the example given in figure [ fig : model_fitting ] .",
    "the model fit faithfully reconstructs the input physical parameters , including the correct attribution of source and lens brightness .",
    "one operational question that arises is how does one determine whether a dark lens model is appropriate for a given microlensing event . while one could straightforwardly test the luminous lens hypothesis by adding a relative source / lens luminosity parameter to the microlensing fit model as presented here , a more obvious and compelling resolution to this question is contained in the possible chromaticity of the astrometric observables as described in eq .",
    "[ eq : astrometric_perturbation ] .",
    "if the lens is luminous , then its spectral content is in general different from that of the source  implying that both the photometric and astrometric observables will be functions of wavelength .",
    "making the observations in a variety of spectral bands will identify the relative source - lens intensity and color , and provide the necessary data to robustly extend the microlensing model to the general case of luminous lenses .",
    "we defer a more systematic analysis of the luminous lens case to future work .",
    "the closely related problem of image blending is discussed in recent work by alard ( @xcite ) , and woniak & paczyski ( @xcite ) , who consider the possibility that a second source ( possibly unrelated to either source or lens ) is unresolved from the image .",
    "woniak & paczyski find that the degeneracies in photometric observation of such events result in systematic errors in estimating lensing parameters .",
    "based on our preliminary successes in correctly distinguishing source and lens luminosities , we concur with the speculation put forward by woniak & paczyski that multi - spectral astrometry and photometry breaks the degeneracy in ( some subset of ) blended events , and point this out as a particularly important case for future study .",
    "a number of authors have suggested to broaden the applicability of the astrometric techniques to generic microlensing events ( @xcite ) .",
    "these events could potentially be detected astrometrically in programs that concentrated on high proper motion objects ( so as to sweep - out larger solid angles ) , or as a part of broader companion search program ( something we have integrated into our pti program ",
    "@xcite ) . while much of the phenomenology we have developed in ",
    "[ sec : microlensing_theory ] is directly applicable , there is a practical difficulty in establishing lensing parameters in such events by differential means .",
    "the first is the absence of a ready supply of reference objects that share common parallactic motions as the source .",
    "the fact that the rich lmc , smc , and bulge fields used in the photometric surveys naturally yield an abundance of reference objects for which @xmath96 is small makes events in these fields unique .",
    "without such a common parallactic reference , the systematic errors in the determination of @xmath79 will be too large to establish a precise lens mass from ground - based differential astrometry .",
    "such events would seem to be best studied by space - based , global astrometric techniques .",
    "while the majority of photometrically detected events are consistent with single lens hypothesis , a number of binary lens events have been reported ( @xcite ) . in a recent preprint dominik ( @xcite )",
    "argues that photometry alone does not uniquely constrain the binary lens parameters .",
    "we speculate that additional astrometric information would break the degeneracies among various hypotheses in binary lens events through straightforward extensions of the astrometric theory developed here .",
    "we defer the analysis of the binary lens case to future work .",
