    "a high fraction of disc galaxies are lopsided , i.e. their gas and/or stellar component extend further out on one side of the galaxy than on the other ( baldwin , lynden - bell & sancisi 1980 ; block et al .",

    "2008 for a review ) .    the gaseous component of the disc is particularly affected by this phenomenon .",
    "richter & sancisi ( 1994 ) show that the lopsidedness of a galaxy can be inferred from asymmetries in its global hi profile , and estimate , from the analysis of 1700 hi spectra , that @xmath2 per cent of disc galaxies are lopsided in the gaseous component .",
    "haynes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) confirm this result by the analysis of high signal - to - noise hi spectra of 104 galaxies , and suggest that some of the asymmetries may be induced by nearby companions ( e.g. ngc  5324 ) .",
    "matthews et al .",
    "( 1998 ) indicate that the incidence of gas lopsidedness is higher in the late - type galaxies ( @xmath3 per cent ) .",
    "the kinematics of the gas is often affected by lopsidedness : swaters et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find that the rotation curve of lopsided galaxies is rising more steeply on one side than on the other .",
    "rix & zaritsky ( 1995 ) and zaritsky & rix ( 1997 ) , using near - infrared photometry of nearly face - on spiral galaxies , show that even the stellar component is lopsided in @xmath4 per cent of their sample .",
    "similarly , rudnick & rix ( 1998 ) , using _",
    "r_@xmath5band photometry , find that @xmath1 per cent of their sample of nearly face - on early - type disc galaxies ( s0 to sab ) is lopsided in the stellar component .",
    "thus , the incidence of stellar lopsidedness is similar for late - type and for early - type disc galaxies , although slightly lower in the latter case .",
    "the analysis of 25155 lopsided galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( reichard et al .",
    "2008 ) confirms that the lopsided distribution of stellar light is due to a corresponding lopsidedness in the stellar mass .",
    "finally , images and spatially integrated spectra of late - type galaxies ( rudnick , rix & kennicutt 2000 ) suggest a correlation between star formation and lopsidedness .",
    "the hypothesis that lopsidedness is due to galaxy interactions has been long discussed .",
    "based on optical images , odewahn ( 1994 ) finds that 71 of 75 lopsided magellanic spirals have a nearby companion .",
    "however , wilcots & prescott ( 2004 ) obtain hi data of 13 galaxies from odewahn ( 1994 ) and show that only four of them have hi - detected neighbours .",
    "thus , either lopsidedness is not related to galaxy interactions , or the asymmetries produced by these interactions are long - lived ( surviving for @xmath6 orbital times after the encounter ) and the lopsidedness persists even when the companion is quite far - off .    from the theoretical point of view , the n - body simulations by walker , mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) suggest that minor mergers can induce lopsidedness over a long timescale ( @xmath7 1 gyr ) .",
    "however , b05 indicate that the lopsidedness produced by minor mergers disappears when the companion is completely disrupted .",
    "since most of observed lopsided galaxies are not undergoing mergers , the minor - merger scenario does not seem viable .",
    "b05 indicate that the most likely mechanism to produce lopsidedness is the accretion of gas from cosmological filaments .",
    "alternative models suggest that baryonic lopsidedness can be induced by a lopsided dark matter halo ( jog 1997 , 2002 ; angiras et al .",
    "2007 ) or by the fact that the disc is off - centre with respect to the dark matter halo ( levine & sparke 1998 ; noordermeer , sparke & levine 2001 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we address the problem of the origin of lopsidedness by means of n - body / smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations .",
    "in particular , we re - analyze in more detail the hypothesis of gas accretion , already proposed by b05 , and we consider two new possible scenarios : the role of flyby interactions with smaller companions and that of ram pressure from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .    for a comparison with observational data ,",
    "we focus on the case of the edge - on galaxy ngc  891 .",
    "we stress that quantifying lopsidedness in edge - on galaxies is more difficult than in face - on galaxies , as bright regions on one side of the disc can be confused with lopsidedness . however , the lopsidedness of ngc  891 is well assessed ( sancisi & allen 1979 ; baldwin et al .",
    "1980 ; rupen 1991 ; swaters , sancisi & van der hulst 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , for ngc  891 recent hi observations are available , among the deepest ever obtained for an external galaxy ( oosterloo , fraternali & sancisi 2007 , hereafter o07 ) .",
    "this galaxy also shows many interesting peculiarities , e.g. the existence of a gaseous filament extending up to @xmath1 kpc vertically from the disc and located at @xmath8 kpc from the centre of the galaxy .",
    "finally , ngc  891 has also a smaller , gas - rich companion , ugc  1807 , located at a projected distance of @xmath9 kpc , in the direction of the above mentioned gaseous filament .",
    "in this paper , we simulate three different processes : i ) flyby interactions ; ii ) accretion from gaseous filaments ; iii ) ram pressure from the igm .",
    "for all these scenarios we use a galaxy model similar to ngc  891 and whose main properties are listed in table  1 .",
    "such galaxy model has been generated by using the method already described in mapelli 2007 ( hereafter m07 ; see also hernquist 1993 ; mapelli , ferrara & rea 2006 ; mapelli et al .",
    "2008a , 2008b ) . here",
    "we briefly summarize the most important points , referring to m07 for the details .",
    "the galaxy model has four different components :    * a navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 , nfw ) dark matter halo with virial mass @xmath10 ( o07 ) , virial radius @xmath11 kpc , and concentration @xmath12 ; * a stellar exponential hernquist disc ( hernquist 1993 ; m07 ) with mass @xmath13 , scalelength @xmath14 kpc ( shaw & gilmore 1989 ) , and scaleheight @xmath15 ; * a stellar spherical hernquist bulge ( hernquist 1993 ; m07 ) with mass @xmath16 , and scalelength @xmath17 ; * a gaseous exponential hernquist disc ( hernquist 1993 ; m07 ) with mass @xmath18 ( o07 ) , scalelength @xmath19 , and scaleheight @xmath20 .",

    "dark matter particles have mass equal to @xmath26 , whereas disc , bulge and gas particles have mass equal to @xmath27 .",
    "softening lengths are 0.2 kpc for halo particles and 0.1 kpc for disc , bulge and gas particles ( for the criterion used to estimate the softening , see dehnen 2001 ) .",

    "this suggests the existence of a non - negligible amount of diffuse igm even in poor groups . in particular , gas is ram - pressure stripped from a galaxy if the density of the igm is ( gunn & gott 1972 ; mcconnachie et al .",
    "2007 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the relative velocity between the galaxy and the igm and @xmath34 is the column density of hi .",
    "thus , if the igm density is higher than the threshold value in equation  ( [ eq : ram ] ) , even galaxies which are isolated or in small groups can suffer ram pressure and the distribution of their gas might appear lopsided .    according to bland - hawthorn , freeman & quinn ( 1997 )",
    ", ram pressure heating can explain the fact that some galaxies ( e.g. the lopsided galaxy ngc 253 ) have a truncated hi disc but present high temperature , ionized gas extending beyond the hi disc . similarly , ryder et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that ram pressure is responsible for the hi wake observed in the spiral galaxy ngc  7421 .",
    "to check the hypothesis that lopsidedness is induced by ram pressure , we made a simulation where the galaxy is moving into a cylinder of uniform gas with density @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 km s@xmath38 .",
    "we made different runs , changing the inclination of the relative velocity @xmath33 with respect to the plane of the galaxy between 0 and 45@xmath39 .",

    "the main result of this paper is that all the considered processes induce lopsidedness in the gaseous component . in the following ,",

    "we firstly describe the morphological features of the simulated gaseous and ( global and young ) stellar component in the three scenarios ( sections  [ sec : fly]-[sec : ram ] ) .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows the density of the gas in the target galaxy ( seen edge - on ) and in the companion galaxy ( face - on ) @xmath42 myr after the interaction , when the projected distance between the two galaxies is @xmath9 kpc , i.e. comparable with the observations of ngc  891 and ugc  1807 .",
    "the simulation matches some of the properties of the ngc  891@xmath5ugc  1807 system .",
    "first , a gaseous filament connects the two galaxies in the simulation .",
    "the filament starts at @xmath4110 kpc ( projected distance along the @xmath43-axis ) from the centre of the target galaxy , which is the position where the intruder reached the closest approach with the target .",
    "this filament is mostly due to the gas stripped from the companion galaxy .",
    "the position of the filament is the same as in the observations ( o07 ) .",
    "however , in the simulation the density of gas is more or less constant along the filament , whereas in the data only the part of the filament which is closest to ngc  891 is visible .",
    "second , the edge - on disc of the target galaxy is clearly lopsided ( see the zoom in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the disc extends further out on the side of the galaxy which is opposite with respect to the intruder .",
    "indeed , the lopsidedness is induced by the flyby , as the perturbation originated exactly where the intruder penetrated the disc of the target . at the time shown by figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and  [ fig : fig2 ] ( i.e. @xmath42 myr after the flyby ) , the galactic disc has completed a half - rotation , and the perturbation appears on the other side of the disc with respect to its initial position .",
    "third , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows that even the stellar component of the simulated galaxy has some degree of lopsidedness , although less evident than in the gas .",
    "the observations also show that the stellar component of ngc  891 is slightly lopsided , especially the young population ( van der kruit & searle 1981 ; rand , kulkarni & hester 1990 ; hoopes , walterbos & rand 1999 ; kamphuis et al . 2007a ; kamphuis et al .",
    "we also ran check simulations with different disc scalelength @xmath44 ( between 2.2 and 8.8 kpc ) , but we did not find significant differences from the point of view of lopsidedness .",
    "then , the flyby scenario seems to reproduce quite well the lopsidedness of ngc  891 .",
    "furthermore , the simulations suggest that the perturbation induced by flybys is long - lived ( @xmath45 myr ) , explaining the origin of lopsidedness even in galaxies which have no longer interacting companions",
    ". this might be important , as many studies do not find any correlation between lopsidedness and nearby companions ( rix & zaritsky 1995 ; zaritsky & rix 1997 ; wilcots & prescott 2004 ; b05 ) .",
    "gas accretion from cosmological filaments is also able to produce lopsidedness , as suggested by b05 .",
    "however , the kind of lopsidedness that might be induced by gas accretion is quite different from the one connected with flybys .",
    "this can be seen from the comparison between fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "both figures show the density of gas in the edge - on ( upper panels ) and face - on ( lower panels ) view of the galaxy , but fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] refers to the flyby scenario and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] to the gas accretion from a coplanar filament ( acc1 ) . in the case of gas accretion",
    ", the lopsidedness appears much more pronounced , especially in the face - on view .",
    "of course , this depends on the chosen accretion rate ( @xmath46 yr@xmath38 in acc1 ) and on the duration of the accretion phase ( 720 myr in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "however , even smaller accretion rates ( down to @xmath47 yr@xmath38 ) and different timescales for the accretion ( 0.5@xmath51.0 gyr ) produce approximately the same morphology .",
    "therefore , the simulated galaxy looks more like , e.g. , ngc  1637 than ngc  891 .",
    "of course , our models suffer from various limitations , such as the intrinsic problems of the sph treatment of gas ( see agertz et al .",
    "2007 ) , the mass resolution and the fact that we do not account for various feedback processes ( e.g. the cooling for temperatures below 10@xmath48 k ) .",
    "thus , we can not take the morphology inferred from our simulations as a conclusive proof .",
    "however , the morphological difference seen in our simulations might suggest an intrinsic morphological difference in observed galaxies between lopsidedness induced by gas accretion and lopsidedness induced by flybys .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to compare the morphologies of observed lopsided galaxies , with or without companions , in order to check whether any difference can be found ( as an example , we suggest the cases of ngc  1637 and ngc  891 ) .    furthermore , the total stellar component ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) does not seem to be lopsided in the gas accretion scenario , at odds with the observations of ngc  891 .",
    "instead , the young stellar population ( i.e. the simulated star particles which have an age @xmath49 myr ) shows a clear lopsidedness ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that gas accretion does not affect stars and induces lopsidedness only in the gas component .",
    "the distribution of young stars is also lopsided , because these stars formed after the gas component has become lopsided",
    ". we can consider this process a sort of star formation driven lopsidedness ( see section  [ sec : m1 ] for details ) .",
    "the gas accretion from a coplanar filament does not produce anything similar to the gaseous filament observed in ngc  891 .",
    "in runs acc2 and acc3 we change the orientation of the filament ( see table 2 ) , in order to see whether we can reproduce the filament observed in ngc  891 .",
    "however , in runs acc2 and acc3 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] and [ fig : fig7 ] , respectively ) the galaxy disc becomes not only lopsided but also strongly distorted .",
    "this feature is not present in ngc  891 and in most of observed lopsided galaxies , whereas it might be somehow connected with warps .",
    "such distortion tends to disappear only if the accretion rate is sufficiently small ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "as cosmological simulations indicate that non - coplanar filaments exist ( keres et al . 2005 ) , this may put limits on the density and/or on the lifetime of cosmological filaments .",
    "further study of gas filaments in cosmological simulations is required , in order to quantify this effect . on the other hand",
    ", non - coplanar gas accretion does not produce any structure like the filament observed in ngc  891 , unless we assume that the cosmological filament itself ( or its remnant ) is still observable today and represents the feature observed in ngc  891 .    indeed ,",
    "the co - existence of two different cosmological filaments , one coplanar inducing lopsidedness and the other non - coplanar producing the observed filament in ngc  891 , might explain the morphology of this galaxy , but seems quite fine - tuning .",
    "even ram pressure induces lopsidedness ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig8 ] ) , after a sufficiently large amount of time ( @xmath51 myr ) . however , lopsidedness produced by ram pressure appears less pronounced than that induced by either flybys or gas accretion .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that ram pressure perturbs especially the low density gas in the peripheral regions , but does not affect the central parts of the disc .",
    "thus , the effect of ram pressure is that of producing a faint tidal tail , more than a strong asymmetry .",
    "the stellar component , both old and young , does not suffer significant perturbations due to ram pressure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8bis ] ) .    obviously , this result depends on our initial parameters , i.e. the density of the igm and the relative velocity . on the other hand ,",
    "a density higher than @xmath35 @xmath36 seems unrealistic for isolated galaxies ( but this might be due to the lack of dedicated observations , as the paper by mcconnachie et al .",
    "2007 suggests ) .",
    "as a lower density of the igm would produce smaller perturbations , we infer that ram pressure can not induce strong lopsidedness .    another point to stress is the role of the orientation of the relative velocity .",
    "we explored different inclinations of the relative velocity vector with respect to the plane of the galaxy , from 0 to 45@xmath52 .",
    "large inclinations ( @xmath53 ) produce tidal tails which are non - coplanar with the galaxy , and this does not look like lopsidedness . only for smaller inclinations",
    "the tidal tail resembles a feature of lopsidedness .",
    "finally , we did not find any way to reproduce the filament observed in ngc  891 with ram pressure .",
    "ram pressure with non - zero inclination with respect to the plane of the galaxy ( e.g. @xmath54 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ) produces some vertical perturbations in the gas density , but these are transient and much smaller than the observed filament in ngc  891 .      in order to quantify our results , we derive the value of the fourier @xmath0 component for the surface density of our gaseous and stellar discs .",
    "@xmath0 asymmetries are the best indicator of lopsidedness in stellar discs ( rix & zaritsky 1995 ; zaritsky & rix 1997 ; b05 ) .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] shows the normalized strength of the fourier component @xmath0 ( a1 ) as a function of radius , for all the considered models .",
    "a1 has been defined as in equation  ( 1 ) of b05 .",
    "we calculated a1 for both the stellar and the gaseous component . in the case of the stellar component we distinguish between the global stellar population ( central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) and the young stars ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) .",
    "the behaviour of a1 for the gaseous component is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] . in the case of gas accretion ( acc1 , triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) a1 rises very steeply , and reaches the value of @xmath55 at @xmath56 .",
    "a1 rises also in the flyby ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) and in the ram pressure ( squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) scenarios , indicating lopsidedness , but it reaches smaller values ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we also calculated the value of @xmath57 , i.e. the average value of a1 between 1.5 and 2.5 disc scalelengths ( see b05 ) . according to b05 ,",
    "a galaxy is lopsided when @xmath58 . for the gaseous component",
    ", we found @xmath590.08 , 0.28 and 0.06 for the flyby , gas accretion and ram pressure scenario , respectively .",
    "thus , all these three scenarios induce lopsidedness in the gaseous component , but the asymmetry produced by gas accretion is much stronger than the one due to flybys and ram pressure .",
    "this confirms what we found from a qualitative analysis in the previous sections .    the central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] shows the behaviour of a1 for the global stellar component . in the flyby scenario",
    "the lopsidedness of the stellar population is similar to the one of the gaseous component : a1 rises almost monotonously from @xmath60 at the centre to @xmath28 at @xmath61 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the flyby affects both the gaseous and the stellar component .",
    "instead , in the gas accretion and in the ram pressure scenarios a1 remains almost flat through the entire disc .",
    "similarly , for the stellar component , @xmath590.08 , 0.02 and 0.01 for the flyby , gas accretion and ram pressure scenario , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the stellar population is not lopsided in the case of gas accretion and ram pressure .",
    "this finding might seem inconsistent with the results by b05 , where gas accretion is shown to induce lopsidedness also in the stellar component .",
    "however , fig .",
    "17 of b05 shows that @xmath62 for @xmath63 gyr , in agreement with our results .",
    "a value of @xmath64 is reached only at @xmath65 gyr in the simulations presented by b05 .",
    "this means that , in the gas accretion scenario , there is a time delay between the epoch in which lopsidedness appears in the gaseous distribution and the epoch in which even the stellar component starts to be lopsided .",
    "the extent of this delay depends mainly on the efficiency of star formation .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] , which shows the behaviour of a1 for the young stellar population ( @xmath66 myr ) . in the case of gas accretion",
    "the lopsidedness of the young stellar population is much higher than that of the total stellar population : @xmath67 is @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the young stars and for the total stellar mass , respectively .",
    "the difference between the distribution of young stars and that of the total stellar component in the gas accretion scenario is also evident , qualitatively , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( see section  [ sec : accr ] ) . in the case of flybys ,",
    "the young stars are lopsided ( @xmath70 ) approximately in the same amount as the global stellar content ( @xmath71 ) . in the case of ram pressure ,",
    "the young stars are not lopsided ( @xmath72 ) , as already noted for the entire stellar population .",
    "this supports the idea that there are two possible forms of stellar lopsidedness : in the first case the lopsidedness of the stars originates at the same epoch and for the same mechanism as the lopsidedness of gas ( e.g. for a flyby ) , in the second case the lopsidedness of the stellar component is a consequence of the ( pre - existing ) lopsidedness of the gas ( e.g. for gas accretion ) . in the latter case , lopsidedness is present only ( or mostly ) in the young stellar population , unless the system had enough time to evolve after the process which induced lopsidedness in the gas .",
    "for example , after @xmath73 gyr from the beginning of gas accretion , the difference between spatial distribution of old and young stellar population is large , whereas no significant difference in the lopsidedness of young and old stars is expected , if the gas accretion from cold filaments started much more than @xmath74 gyr ago ( and cosmological simulations suggest that cold gas accretion was more important at high redshift than today , keres et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "most of observational work on stellar lopsidedness ( rix & zaritsky 1995 ; zaritsky & rix 1997 ; rudnick & rix 1998 ) focuses on quite red bands ( especially @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , in order to track the mass distribution . as",
    "young stars account only for a small fraction of the light in these bands ( especially in early - type disc galaxies ) , we expect that the observed stellar lopsidedness is different from what we find in the gas accretion scenario , unless gas accretion started sufficiently far ago .",
    "furthermore , observational studies indicate that lopsidedness in the stellar light distribution is primarily tracing lopsidedness in the total stellar mass distribution ( rudnick & rix 1998 ; reichard et al .",
    "in particular , the incidence of stellar lopsidedness is similar in late - type ( @xmath4 per cent , rix & zaritsky 1995 ) and in early - type disc galaxies ( @xmath1 per cent , rudnick & rix 1998 ) , indicating that the asymmetric light distribution is not due to recent asymmetric star formation , but reflects global asymmetric mass distribution .",
    "this implies that the observed stellar lopsidedness may be connected with flyby events or with long - lived gas accretion , but not with recent ( @xmath77 gyr ) gas accretion .    on the other hand , zaritsky & rix ( 1997 ) and rudnick et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show that there is a correlation between lopsidedness and star formation rate .",
    "this suggests that , even if lopsidedness is not due to recent star formation , the event which produced lopsidedness has also triggered star formation .",
    "this matches quite well both the flyby and the gas accretion scenario , where a star formation enhancement by a factor of @xmath6 is induced by the galaxy interaction and by the feeding of fresh cold gas , respectively .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , all the considered mechanisms induce a certain degree of lopsidedness in the density distribution of disc galaxies .",
    "we now compare the effects that these three mechanisms have on the hi spectrum and on the kinematics , which in the observational data also appear to be affected by lopsidedness .    in order to derive the hi spectrum and the rotation curve of the galaxy ,",
    "we adopt a procedure as similar as possible to the one used by observers : we rotate the simulated galaxy by the same inclination angle as the observed ngc  891 ( i.e. @xmath78 ) and we calculate the velocity of gas particles along the line - of - sight ( the details of this procedure are given in mapelli et al",
    ". 2008b ) .",
    "the derived hi spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] and compared with the observational data of ngc  891 ( richter & sancisi 1994 ) .",
    "these results are quite interesting , as the gas accretion scenario ( central panel ) has some problem in reproducing the data , whereas the ram pressure ( bottom panel ) and especially the flyby scenario ( top panel ) match quite well the observations .",
    "this might be crucial , if not for all the lopsided galaxies , at least for the case of ngc  891 .",
    "in fact , other lopsided galaxies have significantly different spectra ( see fig .  3 of richter & sancisi 1994 ) , which might be reproduced even by gas accretion ( e.g. ngc  5006 or ngc  4303 )",
    ". however , the spectrum of ngc  891 seems to agree only with the scenarios of ram pressure and flyby .",
    "analogous conclusions can be inferred from the analysis of the rotation curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] ) .",
    "we calculated two partial rotation curves for each simulated galaxy , one for the receding side of the galaxy ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] ) and the other for the approaching side ( squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] ) .",
    "this procedure is analogous to the position - velocity diagram and has been adopted to quantify kinematic lopsidedness in swaters et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    in the flyby scenario ( top panel )",
    "the rotation curve declines gently at larger radii than @xmath79 kpc , especially in the receding side .",
    "the same trend is apparent from the new data of ngc  891 ( see fig .  5 of o07 ) .",
    "a similar behaviour can be found in the ram pressure case ( bottom panel ) , although the decrease starts at larger radii and is less pronounced .",
    "instead , in the gas accretion case ( central panel ) the rotation curve is almost flat everywhere .",
    "furthermore , in the flyby scenario the rotation curve of the receding side is more steeply rising than the one of the approaching side in the range between @xmath79 and @xmath8  kpc .",
    "an analogous trend also exists in the partial rotation curves of ngc  4395 and dd0  9 ( swaters et al .",
    "1999 ) , while the case of ngc  891 is uncertain ( o07 ) .",
    "also in the gas accretion scenario the rotation curve of the receding side is steeper , but at larger radii ( @xmath80 kpc ) , whereas in the ram pressure case the two sides behave in the same way .",
    "we stress that in some observed ( rubin , hunter & ford 1991 ; hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "2003 ) and simulated ( pedrosa et al . 2008 ) interacting galaxies the receding side of the rotation curve is slightly different from the approaching side .",
    "this circumstance may also suggest a connection between lopsidedness and flybys .",
    "in this paper we considered three different physical mechanisms acting on disc galaxies : flyby interactions , accretion from cosmological gas filaments and ram pressure from the igm .",
    "we showed that all of these processes might induce lopsidedness in the gaseous component of discs .",
    "likely , these three scenarios are not exclusive , but might account for lopsidedness in different galaxies .",
    "our simulations suggest that the features of lopsidedness induced by these three processes are slightly different from each other .",
    "in particular , ram pressure creates only moderate tidal tails in galaxies , whereas flybys account for much stronger asymmetries and gas accretion from filaments might produce even more pronounced lopsidedness .",
    "the spectra and the kinematic features connected with these three scenarios are also slightly different . furthermore , ram pressure is not able to induce lopsidedness in the stellar population , whereas flybys simultaneously produce asymmetries in the gaseous and in the stellar disc .",
    "gas accretion from filaments generates asymmetries only in the gaseous disc , but the star formation in the asymmetric gaseous disc induces lopsidedness in the stellar component at later times .",
    "thus , our simulations suggest that there is not a unique manifestation of lopsidedness but many different forms : lopsidedness may be driven by various mechanisms , and , depending on this , it may affect only the gas and not ( or not yet ) the stellar population , it may be more or less pronounced , it may have different timescales .",
    "this might also explain why the observed incidence of lopsidedness is different in the stellar and in the gaseous component .",
    "thus , it is interesting to look at the observational properties of lopsided galaxies , and check whether their morphological features allow to infer which process produced their lopsidedness . in particular , the characteristics of mildly - lopsided ( e.g. ngc  891 ) and strongly - lopsided ( e.g. ngc  1637 ) galaxies can be studied separately , in order to find any intrinsic difference between them ( e.g. differences in the incidence of companion galaxies , in the star formation rate , in the distribution of young stars ) .",
    "furthermore , lopsided galaxies are also observed in groups and clusters ( haynes , giovanelli & kent 2007 , and references therein ) where flyby interactions and ram pressure effects can be even more important .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the fraction of lopsided galaxies as a function of environment .",
    "another possible feature of lopsidedness which needs to be investigated , both by theoretical models and by observations , are metallicity gradients .",
    "there are no specific observations of metallicity gradients in lopsided galaxies . in the case of both flybys and ram pressure",
    "no significant metallicity gradients are expected .",
    "instead , in the case of cold accretion the metallicity of the gaseous filament is likely lower than the one of the target galaxy .",
    "for example , ocvirk et al . (",
    "2008 ) derive a metallicity @xmath81 ( with a very large spread ) for the cold gas accreted from low density filaments at redshift @xmath82 , whereas the median metallicity for a milky way - like galaxy is @xmath83 . however , it is unclear whether this feature is preserved ( and observable ) in the nearby universe .",
    "in fact , it is likely that stars form from a mixture between the gas in the cold filament and the gas which was already in the disc .",
    "furthermore , if the gas accretion from the filament is not recent , but occurred in the past , pollution from supernovae , stellar winds and other feedback mechanisms have already erased any metallicity gradient both in the gaseous and in the stellar component .    here",
    ", we focused our analysis on the case of ngc  891 .",
    "its morphology , the existence of a companion and of a gaseous filament pointing towards it , the observed hi spectrum and also the shape of the rotation curve favour the hypothesis of a flyby as source of lopsidedness .",
    "however , we can not exclude other scenarios .",
    "in particular , the origin of the gaseous filament observed in ngc  891 might be completely different from that of lopsidedness ( e.g. a galactic fountain ; but see fraternali & binney 2006 ) .",
    "other observed galaxies ( e.g. ngc  2985 , sancisi et al .",
    "2008 ) show features of lopsidedness similar to those of ngc  891 and have nearby companions .",
    "for example , ngc  3027 , the companion of ngc  2985 , has an asymmetric hi distribution .",
    "previous studies ( wilcots & prescott 2004 ; b05 and references therein ) tend to exclude a link between galaxy interactions and lopsidedness .",
    "however , b05 do not consider flybys but only minor mergers .",
    "the main difference between a merger and a flyby is that the merger remnant remains visible inside the target galaxy for a long time after the beginning of the merger .",
    "thus , if lopsidedness was due to mergers , we should also detect the remnants , which is not the case .",
    "instead , in a flyby , the companion goes away after the interaction . as the effects of the flyby are visible for at least @xmath41500 myr after the interaction , the companion has enough time to travel far from the target galaxy .",
    "previous observations do not find a significant correlation between lopsidedness and nearby companions .",
    "however , observations such as those by wilcots & prescott ( 2004 ) consider only companions which are still interacting with the target galaxies . in such analysis ,",
    "companions which had a non - recent flyby with the target are ignored .",
    "even ngc  891 would be considered an isolated galaxy according to this method .",
    "similarly , b05 measure the incidence of companions by the tidal parameter ( see equation 4 of b05 ) .",
    "the tidal parameter of ngc  891 is @xmath84 , which classifies this galaxy as rather isolated ( see fig .",
    "9 of b05 ) .",
    "furthermore , most of the previous studies assume that lopsidedness is produced by the same process in all the observed galaxies .",
    "in this paper we showed that at least three different processes may be responsible for lopsidedness .",
    "thus , the problem of lifetime of lopsidedness induced by flybys disappears : it may be that long - lived lopsidedness is connected with gas accretion , and in this case the lopsided galaxy appears completely isolated ; whereas short - lived lopsidedness is connected with flyby , and in this case the lopsided galaxy has a companion , although non - necessarily an interacting companion .",
    "thus , we argue that the role of flybys in producing lopsidedness can not be excluded on the basis of current observations and simulations .    therefore , an important issue to address is the rate of flybys which may induce lopsidedness .",
    "here we try to do an approximate calculation .",
    "another class of galaxies is known to be produced by flybys : the collisional ring galaxies ( crgs , see mapelli et al",
    ". 2008a , 2008b and references therein ) .",
    "the density of crgs in the local universe is @xmath85mpc@xmath86 ( where @xmath87 is the hubble parameter , few & madore 1986 ) .",
    "ring galaxies are produced during interactions where the mass of the intruder is @xmath88 of the mass of the target ( appleton & struck - marcell 1996 , and references therein ) . from check simulations we found that lopsidedness is induced during galaxy interactions , if the intruder mass is at least @xmath89 of the target mass .",
    "thus , the mass - ratio between intruder and target is similar ( within a factor of 2 ) for interactions producing ring galaxies and for encounters inducing lopsidedness .",
    "however , other characteristics of flybys which induce lopsidedness are different from those of interactions which produce crgs . in particular , to produce a ring",
    ", the flyby must have a very small impact parameter ( @xmath90 , corresponding to @xmath91 per cent of the galaxy radius , few & madore 1986 ) . instead",
    ", lopsidedness is produced by off - centre interactions , with impact parameter as large as @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , regular crgs can not form when the inclination angle between the disc axis of the target and the intruder is too large ( @xmath93 , few & madore 1986 ) , whereas flybys producing lopsidedness do not have this limitation .",
    "finally , ring galaxies are short - lived ( @xmath94 myr , mapelli et al .",
    "2008b ) , whereas in our simulations the lopsidedness is still present at @xmath95 gyr after the flyby .",
    "thus , we can derive the density of galaxies which are lopsided as a consequence of flybys ( @xmath96 ) by considering the density of crgs and by correcting it for these differences is proportional to @xmath97 .",
    "] : @xmath98 substituting in equation  ( [ eq : eqring ] ) the values reported above , we derive @xmath99 mpc@xmath86 .",
    "since the density of relatively bright disc galaxies ( i.e. with absolute magnitude @xmath100 mag ) is @xmath101 mpc@xmath86 ( few & madore 1986 and references therein ) , this suggests that only one galaxy every @xmath102 spiral galaxies can be lopsided as a consequence of flybys .",
    "as lopsidedness of the gas component is observed in @xmath103 per cent of disc galaxies ( richter & sancisi 1994 ) , flybys can reasonably contribute to @xmath1 per cent of lopsided galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , the density of lopsided galaxies which have undergone gas accretion or ram pressure is much more difficult to estimate .",
    "for ram pressure , the peculiar velocities of @xmath104 galaxies in the local volume ( i.e. @xmath105 mpc from the milky way ) are known ( whiting 2005 ) and @xmath106 per cent of them have velocity higher than 100 km s@xmath38 .",
    "however , no data are available for the local density of the igm , and we can not even derive an upper limit for the density of ram - pressure perturbed galaxies . for gas accretion , cosmological simulations show that most of galaxies accrete from cosmological filaments .",
    "thus , all galaxies may have undergone cold accretion .",
    "those galaxies in which the accretion was predominantly coplanar may have become lopsided .",
    "we stress that accretion from non - coplanar filaments might produce distortions in the disc , different from lopsidedness .",
    "this fact deserves further investigations , as it might put constraints on the lifetime , the accretion rate and the existence itself of non - coplanar filaments .",
    "furthermore , the existence of non - coplanar filaments might be associated with the formation of warps ( binney 1992 ) .",
    "finally , in this paper , we did not consider two further possible mechanisms for the origin of lopsidedness : the development of asymmetries due to lopsided dark matter halos ( jog 1997 , 2002 ) or to displacements between disc and halo ( levine & sparke 1998 ) .",
    "these mechanisms might coexist with the three scenarios analyzed in this paper .",
    "however , these mechanisms can not produce the filament observed in ngc  891 .",
