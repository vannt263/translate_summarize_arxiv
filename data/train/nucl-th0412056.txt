    "precise measurements of the beta decay between nuclear analog states of spin , @xmath10 , and isospin , @xmath11 , provide demanding and fundamental tests of the properties of the electroweak interaction .",
    "collectively , these transitions can sensitively probe the conservation of the vector weak current , set tight limits on the presence of scalar or right - hand currents and contribute to the most demanding available test of the unitarity of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , a fundamental tenet of the electroweak standard model .",
    "eight transitions , @xmath12o , @xmath13al@xmath14 , @xmath15cl , @xmath16k@xmath14 , @xmath17sc , @xmath18v , @xmath19mn and @xmath20co are particularly amenable to experiment and , because of their significance to physics , have consequently received a good deal of attention over the past few decades . in each of these cases ,",
    "the experimental @xmath2-value is known to better than @xmath21 . in the 1990s , @xmath22c was added to this list ; its @xmath2 value is known to a precision of @xmath23 .",
    "more recently , three more cases have been added : @xmath24 mg , @xmath15ar and @xmath25rb , with @xmath2-value standard deviations ranging from from @xmath26 to @xmath27 . in the near future these uncertainties will undoubtedly be reduced and an additional eight cases could well be added to the list . though improvements are still possible , with current data we can test the conserved vector current hypothesis at the level of 3 parts in @xmath4 and the three - generation standard model at the level of its quantum corrections .    over the past decade , it has become increasingly clear that the ckm unitarity test made possible by these measurements does not , in fact , quite agree with standard - model expectations .",
    "the test involves the top row of the ckm matrix and requires that the sum of squares of the three experimentally - determined elements , @xmath28 , should equal 1 . with results from superallowed @xmath29-decay providing the input for @xmath30 , and values for @xmath8 and @xmath9 taken from the particle data group reviews , the sum falls short of unity by 0.3 % , more than twice the quoted standard deviation @xcite  a provocative but hardly definitive disagreement .",
    "nevertheless , it has stimulated experimental activity not only on the nuclear decays used to determine @xmath30 but also on the @xmath31 branching ratio used for @xmath8 .",
    "strikingly , a new measurement of the @xmath32 branching ratio @xcite has thrown the accepted value of @xmath8 into doubt .",
    "although the new branching - ratio result disagrees significantly with previous measurements , it would , if taken by itself , lead to a larger value for @xmath8 and thus bring the ckm top - row sum into agreement with unity . at this time , the value of @xmath8 remains controversial and there are a number of kaon - decay experiments currently underway , which should lead to a settled outcome within a very few years .    with all this activity in progress , and the likelihood that a new and reliable value of @xmath8 will soon be forthcoming",
    ", this is an opportune time to produce a complete new survey of the nuclear data used to establish @xmath30 .",
    "this way , we will be able to view the value of @xmath30 with renewed confidence in anticipation of a revised result for @xmath8 .",
    "( @xmath9 is very small and contributes a negligible .001% to the unitarity sum . )",
    "we have published four previous surveys , refs .",
    "@xcite : the most recent appeared fifteen years ago and included only eight superallowed transitions .",
    "in addition to bringing the results for these cases up to date , we are now incorporating data on twelve more transitions and have continued the practice we began in 1984 @xcite of updating all original data to take account of the most modern calibration standards .",
    "we have also made completely new calculations of the statistical rate function , @xmath1 , and employed the most complete radiative and isospin - symmetry - breaking corrections in dealing with the @xmath2-values in the context of fundamental weak - interaction tests .",
    "superallowed fermi beta decay between @xmath33 states depends uniquely on the vector part of the hadronic weak interaction .",
    "when it occurs between isospin @xmath34 analog states , the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis indicates that the @xmath2 values should be the same irrespective of the nucleus , _ viz . _ ft = =  constant , [ ftconst ] where @xmath35 gev@xmath36s , @xmath37 is the vector coupling constant for semi - leptonic weak interactions , and @xmath38 is the fermi matrix element , which for @xmath11 states has the value @xmath39 .",
    "the cvc hypothesis asserts that the vector coupling constant , @xmath40 , is a true constant and not renormalised to another value in the nuclear medium . a demonstration with the data assembled here that the @xmath2 values are indeed constant would provide a stringent test of the cvc hypothesis .",
    "unfortunately , eq .  ( [ ftconst ] ) has to be amended slightly .",
    "firstly , there are radiative corrections because , for example , the emitted electron may emit a bremsstrahlung photon , which goes undetected in the experiment .",
    "secondly , isospin is not an exact symmetry in nuclei so the nuclear matrix element , @xmath38 is slightly reduced from its ideal value , leading us to write : @xmath41 .",
    "thus , we define a  corrected \" @xmath2 value as t ft ( 1 + _ r ) ( 1 - _ c ) = =  constant , [ ftconst ] where @xmath42 is the isospin - symmetry - breaking correction , @xmath43 is the transition - dependent part of the radiative correction , and @xmath44 is the transition - independent part .",
    "fortunately these corrections are all of order 1% but , even so , to maintain an accuracy criterion of 0.1% they must be calculated with an accuracy of 10% of their central value .",
    "this is a demanding request , especially for the nuclear - structure - dependent corrections .    to separate out those terms that are dependent on nuclear structure from those that are not , we split the transition - dependent radiative correction into two terms , _",
    "r^ + _ ns , [ dr ] of which the first , @xmath45 , is a function only of the electron s energy and the charge of the daughter nucleus @xmath46 ; it therefore depends on the particular nuclear decay , but is _ independent _ of nuclear structure .",
    "the second term , @xmath47 , like @xmath42 , depends in its evaluation on the details of nuclear structure . to emphasize the different sensitivities of the correction terms , we rewrite the expression for @xmath3 as t ft ( 1 + _",
    "r^ ) ( 1 + _ ns - _ c ) , [ ftfactor ] where the first correction in brackets is independent of nuclear structure , while the second incorporates the structure - dependent terms .",
    "our procedure in this paper will be to examine all experimental data related to 20 superallowed transitions , comprising those that have been well studied , together with others that have only recently become accessible to precision measurement .",
    "the methods used and the data accepted are presented in sect .  [ exp data ] . the calculations and corrections required to extract final @xmath3-values from these data are described and applied in sect .",
    "[ s : ft ] ; in the same section , we use the resulting @xmath3-values to test cvc . finally , in sect .",
    "[ s : iwip ] we explore the impact of these results on a number of weak - interaction issues : ckm unitarity as well as the possible existence of scalar or right - hand currents .",
    "the @xmath2-value that characterizes any @xmath29-transition depends on three measured quantities : the total transition energy , @xmath48 , the half - life , @xmath49 , of the parent state and the branching ratio , @xmath50 , for the particular transition of interest . the @xmath48-value is required to determine the statistical rate function , @xmath1 , while the half - life and branching ratio combine to yield the partial half - life , @xmath51 . in tables  [ qec]-[reject ] we present the measured values of these three quantities and supporting information for a total of twenty superallowed transitions , incorporating the eight cases we dealt with in our last complete survey @xcite , but now including four more cases that have been measured more recently with comparable precision , and a further eight that are likely to become accessible to precision measurements within the next few years .      in our treatment of the data , we considered all measurements formally published before november 2004 and those we knew to be in an advanced state of preparation for publication by that date .",
    "we scrutinized all the original experimental reports in detail . where necessary and possible",
    ", we used the information provided there to correct the results for calibration data that have improved since the measurement was made . if corrections were evidently required but insufficient information was provided to make them , the results were rejected . of the surviving results , only those with ( updated ) uncertainties that are within a factor of ten of the most precise measurement for each quantity",
    "were retained for averaging in the tables .",
    "each datum appearing in the tables is attributed to its original journal reference _ via _ an alphanumeric code comprising the initial two letters of the first author s name and the two last digits of the publication date .",
    "these alphanumeric codes are correlated with the actual reference numbers in table  [ ref ] .",
    "the statistical procedures we have followed in analyzing the tabulated data are based on those used by the particle data group in their periodic reviews of particle properties , e.g. ref @xcite , and adopted by us in earlier surveys @xcite of superallowed @xmath52 beta decay . in the tables and throughout this work ,  error bars \" and  uncertainties \" always refer to plus - and - minus one standard deviation ( 68% confidence level ) . for a set of @xmath53 uncoupled measurements , @xmath54 , of a particular quantity ,",
    "a gaussian distribution is assumed , the weighted average being calculated according to : = ( _ i w_i ) ^-1/2 , [ ave ] where @xmath55 and the sums extend over all @xmath53 measurements .",
    "for each average , the @xmath56 is also calculated and a scale factor , @xmath57 , determined : s = ^1/2 .",
    "[ scale ] this factor is then used to establish the quoted uncertainty . if @xmath58 , the value of @xmath59 from eq.([ave ] ) is left unchanged .",
    "if @xmath60 and the input @xmath61 are all about the same size , then we increase @xmath59 by the factor @xmath57 , which is equivalent to assuming that all the experimental errors were underestimated by the same factor .",
    "finally , if @xmath60 but the @xmath61 are of widely varying magnitudes , @xmath57 is recalculated with only those results for which @xmath62 being retained ; the recalculated scale factor is then applied in the usual way . in all three cases",
    ", no change is made to the original average @xmath63 calculated with eq.([ave ] ) .",
    "the data for @xmath48 include measurements of both individual @xmath48-values and the differences between pairs of @xmath48-values .",
    "this required a two - step analysis procedure .",
    "we first treated the individual @xmath48-value measurements for each particular transition in the manner already described , obtaining an average result with uncertainty in each case , @xmath64 , where the subscript @xmath65 now designates a particular transition . for transitions unconnected by difference measurements , these uncertainties were scaled if necessary and then the values were quoted as final results . for those transitions involved in one or more difference measurements we combined their average @xmath48 values , @xmath64 , with the difference measurements , @xmath66 , in a single fitting procedure .",
    "if @xmath67 is the number of transitions that are connected by difference measurements , and @xmath68 is the number of those difference measurements , then we have a total of @xmath69 input data values from which we need to extract a final set of @xmath67 average @xmath48-values , @xmath70 .",
    "we accomplish this by minimizing @xmath56 , where ^2 = _ j=1^m_1 ( ) ^2 + _ k=1^m_2 ( ) ^2 [ chi2 ] and @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 designating the two transitions whose @xmath48-value difference is determined in a particular @xmath74 measurement . for each of these individual @xmath48-values",
    ", we obtained its scale factor from eq.([scale ] ) , where the @xmath56 used in that equation is now given by ^2 = _ i ( ) ^2 + _ l ( ) ^2 , [ doubletchi2 ] where @xmath65 is the particular transition of interest .",
    "the sum in @xmath75 extends over all individual @xmath48-value measurements of transition @xmath65 , and the sum in @xmath76 extends over all doublet measurements that include transition @xmath65 as one component .",
    "the resultant value of @xmath57 was applied to the uncertainty , @xmath77 , with the same conventions as were described previously .",
    "the @xmath48-value data appear in tables  [ qec ] and [ qdiff ] . for",
    "the best - known nine superallowed decays ",
    "those of @xmath22c , @xmath12o , @xmath13al@xmath14 , @xmath15cl , @xmath16k@xmath14 , @xmath17sc , @xmath18v , @xmath19mn and @xmath20co  the daughter nuclei are stable , and the most precise determinations of their @xmath48-values have come from direct measurements of that property _ via _ , for example , ( p , n ) or ( @xmath78he , t ) reactions .",
    "such measurements are identified in column 3 of table  [ qec ] by  @xmath79 \" and each individual result is itemized with its appropriate reference in the next three columns . the weighted average ( see eq.([ave ] ) ) of all measurements for a particular decay appears in column 7 , with the corresponding scale factor ( see eq.([scale ] ) ) in column 8 .",
    "a few of these cases , like @xmath15cl and @xmath18v , have no further complications .",
    "there are other cases , however , in which @xmath48-value differences have been measured in addition to the individual @xmath48-values .",
    "these measurements are presented in table  [ qdiff ] .",
    "they have been dealt with in combination with the direct @xmath48-value measurements , as described in section  [ eval ] ( see , in particular , eq.([chi2 ] ) ) , with the final average @xmath48-value appearing in column 7 of table  [ qec ] and the average difference in column 4 of table  [ qdiff ] . both are flagged with footnotes to indicate the interconnection .",

    "<S> a complete and critical survey is presented of all half - life , decay - energy and branching - ratio measurements related to 20 superallowed @xmath0 decays ; no measurements are ignored , though some are rejected for cause and others updated . </S>",
    "<S> a new calculation of the statistical rate function @xmath1 is described and experimental @xmath2 values determined . </S>",
    "<S> the associated theoretical corrections needed to convert these results into @xmath3 values are discussed , and careful attention is paid to the origin and magnitude of their uncertainties . as an exacting confirmation of the conserved vector current hypothesis , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 values are seen to be constant to 3 parts in @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these data are also used to set a new limit on any possible scalar interaction : @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the average @xmath3 value obtained from the survey , when combined with the muon liftime , yields the up - down quark - mixing element of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix , @xmath6 ; and the unitarity test on the top row of the matrix becomes @xmath7 using the particle data group s currently recommended values for @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we also express this result in terms of the possible existence of right - hand currents . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the priorities for future theoretical and experimental work with the goal of making the ckm unitarity test more definitive . </S>"
