    "the recent photometric space missions such as corot @xcite and _ kepler _ @xcite yielded long and quasi - uninterrupted time series with high precision for a huge amount of variable stars . although few people expected previously , many amazing discoveries have been made for classic high amplitude variables stars , as rr lyraes . among others these mission revealed the excitation of low amplitude modes for many blazhko rrab stars ,",
    "one of which is responsible for the so - called period doubling phenomenon @xcite , while others show the famous @xmath00.61 period ratio of the rrc stars @xcite or just appear as an additional mode(s ) resulting in non - traditional double and triple mode stars @xcite .",
    "the corot satellite was one of the most successful in these discoveries .",
    "up to now about ten peer - reviewed scientific articles published corot rr lyrae results .",
    "the paper of @xcite gives a good overview of these .",
    "previous works discussed 13 stars observed in long runs only and till the end of the fourth long run towards the galactic center direction ( lrc04 ) .",
    "neither the short nor the late runs were investigated for searching rr lyrae stars . we make up for this incompleteness with the present work .",

    "this work used the corot public archive n2 data of exo - fields . for simplicity , we used the entire data base in our rr lyrae search including the initial run ( ira01 ) , long runs ( lra01-lra07 , lrc01-lrc10 ) , and short runs ( sra01-sra05 , src01-src03 ) . here the letters ` c ' and ` a ' denote that the corot observed either toward the galactic centre or anti - centre directions , respectively",
    "the advantage of the use of the total observing material is that we can check our search efficiency when we compare our candidates in the early runs with the rr lyraes found by former studies .",
    "we used the automatic corot variable classifier ( cvc ; @xcite ) when we searched for rr lyrae stars separately for each subtype in the complete data base .",
    "the cvc has improved a lot since the beginning .",
    "our present search results illustrate this well : if we decrease the probability level assigned by cvc of rrab stars from @xmath850% to @xmath810% , then to @xmath80% , we found 15 , 16 and 18 candidates , respectively .",
    "investigating the candidates by visual inspection only one of them proved to be non - rr lyrae stars in the lowest probability group .",

    "eight rrab stars were discussed by former studies ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "two additional rrab stars were known in the corot sample ( corot  101315488 and corot  100881648 ) which have not been found by cvc .",
    "these stars are , however , heavily blended by nearby stars and therefore their variability have much smaller amplitude and distorted light curves compared to a normal rr lyrae star .",
    "the corot data of nine rrab stars have not been discussed anywhere yet .",
    "these stars constitute the present sample ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",

    "the rr lyrae nature of two stars : cmori ( corot  617282043 ) and v2042oph ( corot  659723739 ) have already been known but the other seven ones are completely new discoveries .        the same process ( cvc with decreasing probability levels and visual light curve examination ) has been carried out for rrc subtype as well . for rrc stars we get 25 , 34 and 137 candidates for @xmath850% , @xmath810% , and @xmath80% probability levels , respectively .",
    "the two known rrc stars ( corot105036241 and corot105735652 ) were already contained in the highest probability group .",
    "the increasing candidate numbers of the lower probability level groups did not result in new rrc stars .",
    "the groups consist mostly of binary stars and some spotted and hads / sx  phe candidates .        in the case of double mode rr lyrae stars ( rrd ) the cvc yields different kind of results . for @xmath850% and @xmath810% probability levels",
    "we get only one candidate ( corot101368812 ) which is known as a bona fide rrd star @xcite , while for @xmath80% probability level the number of candidates abruptly increases to 7650 .",
    "we applied a semi - automatic method to handle this large number of light curves .",
    "we calculated the fourier amplitude spectra in the 110d@xmath9 range of all the 7650 light curves .",
    "we selected all peaks from these spectra that exceeded the 4@xmath10 amplitude , where @xmath10 was calculated as the 3d@xmath9 moving average of the amplitude spectrum .",
    "the classical double mode rr lyrae stars have a well - known period ratio between their radial fundamental and first overtone modes @xmath110.72 - 0.755  d@xmath9 which defines the petersen diagram ( see e.g. in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we selected those objects that have their highest peak @xmath12 in the 15d@xmath9 range and that have at least one further significant peak in either the @xmath13@xmath14 or the @xmath15@xmath16 range .",
    "these are those stars that have frequency ratio in the 0.720.755 range with the largest - amplitude peak .",
    "this selection yielded 113 objects .",
    "we investigated the light curves and fourier spectra of these 113 objects visually .",
    "apart from the known corot101368812 , we did not find any further rrd pulsator .",
    "note that 61 targets were identified as @xmath17dor candidates and 42 as eclipsing / heartbeat binary candidates .    from now on ,",
    "this paper refers corot stars with the last three digits ( boldfaced in the first column in table  [ tab1 ] ) of their i d number for short notation .",
    "after we extracted the downloaded data files we applied trend and jump filtering , outlier removal , and a transformation into the magnitude scale as we described in detail in @xcite .",
    "two of our targets ( cm  ori and # 190 ) were bright enough to be observed by corot in colour mode , but because of the uniform handling , we also used their integrated ( white light ) fluxes only .",
    "the nominal sampling is 512 sec for all the stars , except cm  ori , where the the light curve was observed with the much denser oversampling mode ( 32 sec ) .",
    "the data set of cm  ori is twice as dense as the _ kepler_/k2 short cadence observations .",
    "the main tool was a standard discrete fourier analyzer implemented by the program package mufran @xcite .",
    "it yields sinusoidal fourier decomposition , therefore , we used this one through this paper .",
    "the nyquist frequency of the normal and oversampled data are 84.375  d@xmath9 , and 1350  d@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the stability of the periods were checked by o@xmath7c diagrams @xcite .",
    "the o@xmath7c diagrams were constructed from the maximum brightness times .",
    "the proper maximum times were determined by light curve maxima with 7 - 10 order polynomial fits .",
    "the fourier spectra of the analyzed nine stars are dominated by the main pulsation frequencies and their harmonics .",
    "simultaneous non - linear fits to the light curves with these frequencies resulted in the pulsation periods @xmath2 and the amplitudes @xmath3 given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    ", after we pre - whitened the data with @xmath18 and all significant harmonic frequencies .",
    "the inserts show narrower ranges @xmath19 of the spectra after a further pre - whitening step in which we removed all the significant modulation side frequencies as well . ]    * # 020 * : the light curve shows a slight amplitude change ( see the top left panel in fig .",
    "[ bl_fig ] ) .",
    "after we pre - whitened the data with the main pulsation frequency and its significant harmonics we found significant peaks in the residual spectrum around the pre - whitened frequency positions .",
    "we can identify them as blazhko modulation frequencies as @xmath20 , ( @xmath21 is positive integer ) .",
    "the blazhko period @xmath22 given in table  [ tab1 ] was calculated from the average of the side peak differences around the main peak .",
    "the side peak amplitudes are highly asymmetric , the right hand side peaks are much higher than the left hand side ones ( see the top panel in fig .  [ fourier ] ) .",
    "this asymmetry , however , decreases with the increasing harmonic order : while the @xmath23 and @xmath24 are around the detection limit , @xmath25 and even @xmath26 are much less asymmetric .",
    "this behaviour has a natural explanation in the simultaneous amplitude and frequency modulation framework @xcite . in the o@xmath7c diagram ( top right in fig .",
    "[ bl_fig ] ) we indeed find a periodic signal with 80.7  d@xmath9 period and @xmath05  min amplitude which can be identified as the frequency modulation part of the blazhko effect .",
    "the pulsation period of the star # 020 is one of the longest ( @xmath27  d ) ever found for a blazhko rr lyrae star . its blazhko period is long enough to test the relation between the pulsation period and blazhko period discovered by @xcite .",
    "they found that the blazhko frequency , which was represented by the frequency separation between the main pulsation frequency and the side frequencies , has a maximal allowed value at a given pulsation frequency .",
    "these maximal values form a linear upper envelope curve in the pulsation frequency vs. blazhko frequency diagram ( see fig .  6 in @xcite ) .",
    "the position of # 020 is under this upper envelope line supporting the finding of the paper .",
    "both the amplitude and frequency modulation parts of the two observed blazhko cycles differ from each other ( top panels in fig .  [ bl_fig ] ) .",
    "this raises the possibility of multiperiodic ( or chaotic ) nature of the modulation , but such a short observing span does not allow us to confirm or reject these hypotheses .    *",
    "# 132 * : the light curve in the middle left panel in fig .",
    "[ bl_fig ] shows three clear blazhko cycles with decreasing amplitudes .",
    "the fourier spectrum contains evident triplet structures around the main pulsation frequency and all its harmonics .",
    "the low - frequency range of the spectrum contains three significant frequencies : @xmath28  d@xmath9 , @xmath29  d@xmath9 and @xmath30  d@xmath31 .",
    "the frequency @xmath32 can be interpreted as the blazhko frequency @xmath33 itself , the @xmath34 most probable belongs to the total time span , and @xmath35 is a linear combination of these two frequencies .",
    "after the first two pre - whitening steps in which we removed the main pulsation frequency , its harmonics and all significant blazhko side peaks the residual spectrum shows two groups of significant peaks between the harmonics ( middle panel in fig .",
    "[ fourier ] ) .",
    "these peaks are most robust between the main pulsation frequency and the first harmonic .",
    "the highest peak is at @xmath36  d@xmath9 while the second one is at @xmath37  d@xmath9 .",
    "the latter frequency can be identified as @xmath38 which belongs to the period doubling phenomenon . what about the frequency @xmath39 ?",
    "numerous studies @xcite found frequencies at this position : between the period doubling ( pd ) frequencies and the first overtone .",
    "these frequencies are explained by the @xmath40 second radial overtone mode or a non - radial mode which is excited close to the position of the second overtone mode .",
    "# 132 has the highest period ratio @xmath41 ever detected .",
    "the identification of the @xmath42 is verified with theoretical model calculations .",
    "[ dm_model ] shows a theoretical petersen diagram where the periods @xmath2 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 belong to the radial fundamental , first , second , third and fourth overtone modes , respectively .",
    "the different metallicity models are noted by different symbols .",
    "the parameters and details of the models are the same as it was described in @xcite . as we see",
    "the ratio of @xmath39 is in the allowed range of second overtone frequencies .",
    "that is the fourier spectrum of # 132 shows the pd and the radial second overtone mode frequencies simultaneously similarly to some other stars in the corot and _ kepler _ samples ( e.g. corot   101128793 @xcite ; v355  lyr , kic  7257008 , and kic  9973633 @xcite ) .",
    "the o@xmath7c diagram in the middle right panel in fig .  [ bl_fig ] shows evident frequency modulation .",
    "the fourier spectrum of the o@xmath7c diagram contains @xmath33 and @xmath47 reflecting the non - sinusoidal nature of the variation .",
    "the consecutive blazhko cycles are different but do not show declining amplitudes as opposed to the light curve .",
    "the strictly mono - periodic nature of the blazhko effect , similarly to the case of the star # 020 , can be ruled out both on the basis of the light and o@xmath7c curves .",
    "* # 561 * : both the light and o@xmath7c curves ( bottom panels in fig .  [ bl_fig ] ) show the blazhko effect .",
    "the amplitude modulation seems to be more regular than the frequency modulation part .",
    "the modulation side peaks in the fourier spectrum of the light curve are asymmetric : left hand side peaks have lower amplitudes than the right hand side ones .",
    "after we removed all the significant side frequencies , no additional frequencies have been found in the residual spectrum .",
    "interestingly , while all stars that show additional frequencies show the blazhko effect as well @xcite , the reverse statement is not true .",
    "there are known some corot @xcite and _",
    "kepler_/k2 @xcite blazhko stars without any additional frequencies .",
    "as we show here the stars # 561 and # 020 seem to belong to this group .",
    "we can speculate whether this finding is a selection effect or a real feature .",
    "the selection effect explanation is supported by the time dependence of these additional frequencies .",
    "they have low and highly time dependent amplitude .",

    "we shifted the 512  sec corot date with 224  sec as it was described by @xcite .",

    "both diagrams are constant lines with a standard deviation of @xmath69  d , and 0.00132  d for cm ori and # 818 , respectively . in the case of cm ori",
    "this scatter means 0.88  min , or , 0.09% of the period , while for # 818 these values are 1.9  min and 0.3% . to test the accuracy of this o@xmath7c method we prepared synthetic light curves using the fourier solutions ( amplitudes and phase ) of the real stars and adding to them gaussian noise .",
    "the noise was set that the rms of the synthetic light curve fits became equal to the measured light curves : 0.0037  mag for cm ori , and 0.0068  mag for # 818 , respectively .",
    "the standard deviation of the o@xmath7c diagrams of these stationary periodic synthetic data are @xmath700.00058  d ( cm ori ) and @xmath700.00121  d ( # 818 ) .",
    "since we recovered the observed scatters our conclusion is that the random fluctuation of the pulsation period is lower than the detection limit of this method .",
    "secondly a more sensitive method was used to measure phase shifts of each pulsational cycle and transform this to an o@xmath7c diagram .",
    "this approach uses the complete light curve instead of small parts around the maxima and could result in more precise o@xmath7c values than the traditional method .",
    "the method is the same as it was successfully used by @xcite for detecting the random period changes of the _ kepler _ cepheid v1154  cyg .",
    "a template curve was defined by fitting 36th order fourier polynomial to the phase diagram of one pulsational cycle .",
    "then we used it  allowing only vertical and horizontal shifts  to fit each phase in the light curve . combining the phase shifts and the period with the epoch , we calculated the o@xmath7c values which are plotted in fig .",

    "this difference is significant for cm  ori ( top panel in fig  [ o - c_short ] ) but it is also less than 0.0008  d ( 1.2  min ) .",
    "what is the reason of this deviation ?",
    "a frequency modulation ( blazhko effect ) is unlikely because no side peaks have been detected around the harmonics in the fourier spectrum .",
    "the rather irregular shape of these o@xmath7c curves rule out the binarity explanation .",
    "the most natural explanation is the intrinsic random period fluctuation . in other words : the rr lyrae stars are also not precise clocks . due to the cumulative nature of the o@xmath7c diagram we see here a random walk . a detailed discussion of the phenomenon and its appearance in o@xmath7c diagrams is given in @xcite .",
    "a possible irregular period jitter in cepheids and rr lyrae stars was proposed by several authors @xcite on different theoretical grounds .",
    "but up to now it has not been detected yet for rr lyrae stars .",
    "it is possible that our detected small period changes of cm  ori are typical .",
    "the 1.2  min cumulative period change means no more than 1 - 2 seconds differences between the length of the subsequent pulsation cycles .",
    "such a small difference could be detect only in precise uninterrapted high cadence data .          .",
    "]    the fourier amplitude of the harmonics decreases with the harmonic order .",
    "previously this decline was believed to be exponential but ( for at least non - blazhko stars ) it was not studied .",
    "satellite data which provide us high number of significant harmonics showed that this nearly exponentially decay can not necessarily be described by a single exponential function . both of the studied non - blazhko rrab stars ( corot101370131 , @xcite , corot  103800818 @xcite ) show similar behaviour : their amplitudes decline exponentially for a while then this decline shows a bump then the amplitude decreases again exponentially but with a smaller exponent than with the lower order harmonics . in this section",
    "we investigate how general this feature is .",
    "we mention here that the amplitude decline of the blazhko stars were investigated in several papers ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these works concentrated mostly on the different declines of the harmonics and side peak amplitudes .",
    "recently @xcite found a hyperbolic fit for the harmonic decline to be better than the exponential ones . in the case of blazhko stars , however , the amplitudes of the harmonics are heavily affected by the frequency / phase modulation part of the blazhko effect @xcite . in other words ,",
    "in the amplitude decline behaviour the basic physics of the pulsation and unknown aspects of the blazhko effect are mixed . to avoid this complication we restricted our study to the non - blazhko stars .",
    "our sample contains six non - blazhko rr lyrae stars .",

    "the fourier amplitude and phase difference distribution with respect to the harmonic order have been studied for the first time on a larger set of non - blazhko stars .",
    "we found a common amplitude decline feature .",
    "the phase differences show a split distribution .",
    "the observed distributions were compared theoretical works .",
    "our conclusion is that the recent model calculations reproduce the main features but the fine structures can not be described properly .",
    "these amplitude and phase distribution diagrams could be potential diagnostic tools for constraining pulsation models , because of their high sensitivity of the fine structure of the light curves .",
    "we successfully transformed the corot unfiltered light curves , and their fourier parameters to the johnson _ v _",
    "curves , and parameters . as a by - product of the use of the interrelations we found possible flux loss for several stars .",
    "such an effect was shown for high amplitude variables of the _ kepler _ telescope , but has not documented yet in the case of corot satellite .    by using empirical formulae we estimated the basic physical parameters of the complete corot rrab sample .",
    "the estimated physical parameters define two subgroups of the sample .",
    "( 1 ) a shorter period and lower metallicity and ( 2 ) a longer period higher metallicity groups",
    ". the physical parameters of both groups , however , are within the canonical ranges of rr lyrae stars .",
