    "carr  @xcite has conjectured that under certain physical circumstances , spherically symmetric solutions will naturally evolve to a self - similar form from complicated initial conditions , and this is termed as the similarity hypothesis .",
    "this conjecture has been strongly supported in the gravitational collapse of a perfect fluid by numerical simulation and linear stability analysis  @xcite .",

    "their numerical simulation suggests that gravitational waves gradually approach a self - similar form .",
    "the vacuum einstein equations in this symmetry can be analytically integrated , and solutions are called the einstein - rosen waves  @xcite . since this system admits two commutative spatial killing vectors and still retains the dynamical degrees of freedom corresponding to gravitational waves , it provides us with a good toy model in which we can learn the physical nature of gravitational waves .",

    "it is not trivial what boundary conditions we should impose on the solution .",
    "at least , the perturbation must be regular at both points ; otherwise the linear perturbation scheme should break down . noting @xmath133 , the regularity at @xmath112 requires @xmath134 for @xmath90 and @xmath135 for @xmath136 because of the logarithmic divergence of the legendre function of the second kind at @xmath112 .",
    "we additionally impose regularity at @xmath113 and then find that only @xmath137 is allowed .",
    "conversely , for @xmath137 and @xmath134 , the normal modes are regular and analytic both at @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "our first motivation is to explain the numerical simulation by nakao _",
    "et al . _",
    "the parameter value for the background is @xmath67 , for which the surface @xmath59 is an outgoing null singularity , as is shown by harada _",
    "et al . _",
    "since this null singularity is naked , we could inject an incoming wave mode there , in principle .",
    "however , the numerical simulation by nakao _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite will correspond to no injection of such an incoming wave .",
    "this corresponds to the condition that @xmath138 at @xmath113 .",
    "this , as well as the regularity at @xmath112 , excludes all normal mode perturbations .",
    "this conclusion is valid also for all late - time ( @xmath46 ) solutions with any values of @xmath51 under the condition of no incoming wave .",
    "note also that if we do not impose the no incoming wave condition but only the regularity condition at @xmath113 , all normal mode perturbations with @xmath114 are allowed , and , hence , the self - similar evolution is strongly unstable .",
    "so far , we have implicitly assumed late - time solutions , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "however , it is also interesting to study the stability of early - time ( @xmath49 ) solutions in the context of gravitational collapse .",
    "the early - time solutions can be obtained by just flipping the sign of @xmath19 . since in this case",
    "@xmath139 is an ingoing null singularity or regular surface , we can impose the regularity at @xmath112 and @xmath113 . we have seen that under the regularity at both @xmath112 and @xmath113 , only @xmath137 is allowed . since the physical time evolution from @xmath140 to @xmath141 corresponds to the decrease of @xmath142 from @xmath143 to @xmath144 , we can conclude that the self - similar early - time solutions are weakly unstable inside the null surface @xmath139 against the normal modes with eigenvalue @xmath75 satisfying @xmath145 . if @xmath137 , all the values for @xmath75 are allowed .",
    "however , during the time evolution , the most rapidly growing mode will dominate the perturbation . in this sense , growing modes with the growth rate @xmath146 will dominate the perturbation , and this suggests that the critical exponent is 2 if there appears a scaling law for the quantity of the mass dimension .",
    "however , there exist a countably infinite number of unstable modes ; critical behavior in this system would be very different from those which have been studied so far . in the present context , we do not need to refer to the behavior of the perturbation outside the surface @xmath139 .",
    "this is consistent with the renormalization group analysis for the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse , initiated by koike _",
    "et al . _",
    "if we additionally impose the condition @xmath138 at @xmath113 as in the late - time case , all normal mode perturbations are excluded , and , hence , the self - similar evolution becomes stable .",
    "the numerical simulation by nakao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite strongly suggests that a self - similar gravitational wave acts as an attractor in the vacuum region at late times after the explosive burst of cylindrically symmetric gravitational radiation in whole - cylinder symmetry .",
    "motivated with this numerical result , we study the stability of self - similar einstein - rosen waves .",
    "there are exact solutions that describe the self - similar einstein - rosen waves .",
    "the parameter values are identified for the numerical solution found in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the null surface @xmath59 corresponds to a null singularity or a shock gravitational wave .",
    "we have analyzed the behavior of cylindrically symmetric linear perturbation around the self - similar solutions in terms of the normal mode analysis .",
    "we have found that the late - time self - similar solutions are stable inside the surface @xmath59 of gravitational waves at late times under the no incoming wave condition .",
    "this is the case for all the self - similar einstein - rosen waves at late times .",
    "we have also investigated the stability of self - similar einstein - rosen waves at early times , which describe the collapse of gravitational waves .",
    "this is important in the context of gravitational collapse .",
    "we find that self - similar einstein - rosen waves are weakly unstable inside the surface @xmath139 against regular cylindrically symmetric perturbations .",
    "the former case provides us with the demonstration that self - similar solutions that arise from the scale invariance of general relativity play an important role in the dynamics of gravitational waves and , hence , extends the applicability of the similarity hypothesis  @xcite , which was originally proposed for spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "we should note that the locally rotationally symmetric kasner solution is known to be unstable against some sorts of homegenous but anisotropic perturbations  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the self - similarity hypothesis is a consequence of the restriction to the models with few enough degrees of freedom , which , hence , stabilize the self - similar solutions that are not stable in general .",
    "the renormalization group analysis together with linear perturbation scheme is quite useful to understand the asymptotic behavior of the somewhat general solutions of partial differential equations .",
