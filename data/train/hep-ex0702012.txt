    "for many years it was possible to consider the charmonia as a `` well - understood '' system : the spectrum of low - lying states was well - established , with one or two gaps , as were the major transitions . however recently there has been a long list of discoveries , or claims of evidence : the @xmath8 , excitation(s ) of the @xmath9 , and an alphanumeric soup of `` x '' and `` y '' mesons ( and briefly a `` z '' ) , some understandable as @xmath10  states , some where a conventional assignment is elusive .",
    "this revival in spectroscopy is due in part to the large datasets accumulated at the @xmath0-factories , and ( one assumes ) to the lack of strong new - physics - in-@xmath11-violation signals there , making analysis of hidden - charm states respectable . but",
    "much of the interest has been due to the data unsettling our understanding of this sector .",
    "at least two of the new charmonium-_like _ states are candidates for non-@xmath12  mesons , and there are other features in the data that are not yet understood . in the following",
    "we will briefly survey the recent results , with some emphasis on these suggestive cases .",
    "the most extensively studied of the new states is the so - called @xmath4 .",
    "its existence is well - established , and some properties have become increasingly clear ; its mass suggests a bound molecule - like state of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , but this interpretation is by no means uncontested .",
    "the @xmath4 was found by belle  @xcite , with a clear signal in decays @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "confirmations followed in short order  @xcite .",
    "the observations agree on a peak with natural width below experimental resolution , and a dipion mass spectrum concentrated at high values , favouring @xmath16 and hence @xmath17-parity @xmath18 .",
    "decays to @xmath19 are not seen  @xcite .",
    "together with the narrowness of the state , this suggests such decays are forbidden , disfavouring @xmath20 _",
    "etc_. thus a conventional - charmonium @xmath21 would likely have unnatural @xmath22 ( the remaining assignments @xmath23 are exotic ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath24 candidates were surveyed for meson 2004  @xcite ; @xmath25 was also included , as decay to @xmath19 would be suppressed by angular momentum in this case .",
    "there are arguments against each assignment : _",
    "e.g. _  belle finds @xmath26 at 90% confidence , while this ratio is expected to be @xmath27 for the @xmath28 .",
    "this , and some other tests , would bear repetition with the larger event samples currently available .       models with @xmath29 .",

    "this study tends to supersede a belle fit that found @xmath30 ( and hence , odd - parity ) solutions were disfavoured  @xcite .",
