    "roughly speaking ( precise definitions will be given in the next section ) , a beauville surface is a complex surface @xmath1 defined by taking a pair of complex curves , i.e. riemann surfaces , @xmath2 and @xmath3 and letting a finite group @xmath0 act freely on their product to define @xmath1 as a quotient @xmath4 .",
    "these surfaces have a wide variety of attractive geometric properties : they are surfaces of general type ; their automorphism groups @xcite and fundamental groups @xcite are relatively easy to compute ( being closely related to @xmath0 - see section [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) ; these surfaces are rigid surfaces in the sense of admitting no nontrivial deformations @xcite and thus correspond to isolated points in the moduli space of surfaces of general type @xcite .",
    "much of this good behaviour stems from the fact that the surface @xmath4 is uniquely determined by a particular pair of generating sets of @xmath0 known as a ` beauville structure ' .",
    "this converts the study of beauville surfaces to the study of groups with beauville structures , i.e. beauville groups .",
    "beauville surfaces were first defined by catanese in @xcite as a generalisation of an earlier example of beauville ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise x.13(4 ) ) ( native english speakers may find the english translation @xcite somewhat easier to read and get hold of ) in which @xmath5 and the curves are both the fermat curve defined by the equation @xmath6 being acted on by the group @xmath7 ( this choice of group may seem somewhat odd at first , but the reason will become clear later ) .",
    "bauer , catanese and grunewald went on to use these surfaces to construct examples of smooth regular surfaces with vanishing geometric genus @xcite .",
    "early motivation came from the consideration of the ` friedman - morgan speculation '  a technical conjecture concerning when two algebraic surfaces are diffeomorphic which beauville surfaces provide counterexamples to .",
    "more recently , they have been used to construct interesting orbits of the absolute galois group gal(@xmath8 ) ( connections with gothendeick s theory of dessins denfant make it possible for this group to act on the set of all beauville surfaces ) .",
    "we will discuss this in slightly more detail in section 7.6 .",
    "furthermore , beauville s original example has also recently been used by galkin and shinder in @xcite to construct examples of exceptional collections of line bundles .    like any survey article , the topics discussed here reflect the research interests of the author .",
    "slightly older surveys discussing related geometric and topological matters are given by bauer , catanese and pignatelli in @xcite .",
    "other notable works in the area include @xcite .",
    "we remark that throughout we shall use the standard ` atlas ' natation for finite groups and related concepts as described in @xcite , excepting that we will occasionally deviate to minimise confusion with similar notation for geometric concepts .",
    "in section 2 we will introduce the preliminary definitions before proceeding in section 3 to discuss the case of the finite simple groups .",
    "we then go on in section 4 to discuss the abelian and nilpotent groups .",
    "next , we focus our attention on special types of beauville structures when we discuss strongly real beauville structures in section 5 and mixed beauville structures in section 6 .",
    "finally , we discuss a miscellany of related but less well studied topics in section 7 .",
    "a surface @xmath1 is a * beauville surface of unmixed type * if    * the surface @xmath1 is isogenous to a higher product , that is , @xmath9 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are algebraic curves of genus at least 2 and @xmath0 is a finite group acting faithfully on @xmath2 and @xmath3 by holomorphic transformations in such a way that it acts freely on the product @xmath10 , and * each @xmath11 is isomorphic to the projective line @xmath12 and the covering map @xmath13 is ramified over three points .",
    "there also exists a concept of beauville surfaces of mixed type but we shall postpone our discussion of these until section 6 . in the first of the above conditions the genus of the curves in question needs to be at least 2 .",
    "it was later proved by fuertes , gonzlez - diez and jaikin - zapirain in @xcite that in fact we can take the genus as being at least 6 .",
    "the second of the above conditions implies that each @xmath14 carries a regular dessin in the sense of grothendieck s theory of _ dessins denfants _ ( childeren s drawings ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by bely s theorem @xcite this ensures that @xmath1 is defined over an algebraic number field in the sense that when we view each riemann surface as being the zeros of some polynomial we find that the coeffcients of that polynomial belong to some number field .",
    "equivalently they admit an orientably regular hypermap @xcite , with @xmath0 acting as the orientation - preserving automorphism group . a modern account of dessins denfants and proofs of bely s theorem may be found in the recent book of girondo and gonzlez - diez @xcite .",
    "this can also be described instead in terms of uniformisation and the language of fuchsian groups @xcite .",
    "what makes this class of surfaces so good to work with is the fact that all of the above definition can be ` internalised ' into the group .",
    "it turns out that a group @xmath0 can be used to define a beauville surface if and only if it has a certain pair of generating sets known as a beauville structure .",
    "[ maindef ] let @xmath0 be a finite group .",
    "let @xmath15 and let @xmath16    an * unmixed beauville structure * for the group @xmath0 is a set of pairs of elements @xmath17 with the property that @xmath18 such that @xmath19 if @xmath0 has a beauville structure we say that @xmath0 is a * beauville group*. furthermore we say that the structure has * type * @xmath20    traditionally , authors have defined the above structure in terms of so - called ` spherical systems of generators of length 3 ' , meaning @xmath21 with @xmath22 , but we omit @xmath23 from our notation in this survey .",
    "( the reader is warned that this terminology is a little misleading since the underlying geometry of beauville surfaces is hyperbolic thanks to the below constraint on the orders of the elements . ) furthermore , many earlier papers on beauville structures add the condition that for @xmath24 we have that @xmath25 but this condition was subsequently found to be unnecessary following bauer , catanese and grunewald s investigation of the wall - paper groups in @xcite .",
    "a triple of elements and their orders satisfying this condition are said to be hyperbolic .",
    "geometrically , the type gives us considerable amounts of geometric information about the surface : the riemann - hurwitz formula @xmath26 tells us the genus of each of the curves used to define the surface @xmath1 and by a theorem of zeuthen - segre this in turn gives us the euler number of the surface @xmath1 since @xmath27 which in turn gives us the holomorphic euler - poincar characteristic of @xmath1 , namely @xmath28 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.4 ) ) .",
    "furthermore , if a group can be generated by a pair of elements of orders @xmath29 and @xmath30 whose product has order @xmath31 then @xmath0 is a homomorphic image of the triangle group @xmath32 homomorphic images of the triangle group @xmath33 are known as hurwitz groups . in several places in the literature , knowing that a particular group is a hurwitz group has proved useful for deciding its status as a beauville group . for a discussion of known results on hurwitz groups",
    "see the excellent surveys of conder @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition for a group to be a beauville group is that it is 2-generated . in @xcite",
    "it is proved that all non - abelian finite simple groups are 2-generated . for a long time",
    "it was conjectured that every non - abelian finite simple group , aside from the alternating group a@xmath34 , is a beauville group ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 7.17 ) , providing a rich source of examples .",
    "various authors proved special cases of this @xcite .",
    "the full result comes from the following theorem which is proved by the author , magaard and parker in @xcite .",
    "[ simpthm ] with the exceptions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , every finite quasisimple group is a beauville group .",
    "similar results were proved at around the same time by garion , larsen and lubotzky in @xcite ( using probabilistic results concerning triangle groups from the phd thesis of marion @xcite ) and by guralnick and malle in @xcite using the theory of linear algebraic groups . since the overriding ideas behind the proofs given in @xcite are in many ways quite general we sketch these ideas in the hope that they may be useful in proving other conjectures that appear later in this survey .",
    "first note that the alternating groups can be dealt with using classical permutation group theory .",
    "furthermore , the low rank groups of lie type may be dealt with using explicit matrix calculations ( see for instance the work of fuertes and jones in @xcite concerning the groups @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . ) the sporadic simple groups are easily dealt with on a case by case basis with structure constant calculations being useful for the larger groups .",
    "the real difficulty lies with the groups of lie type of unbounded rank .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite simple group of lie type of characteristic @xmath40 . to ensure that we can choose elements of the group @xmath0 whose product behaves as we require we use a theorem of gow @xcite ( a slight generalisation of this result to quasisimple groups",
    "is given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.6 ) ) .",
    "an element of @xmath0 is said to be ` semisimple ' if its order is coprime to @xmath40 and is said to be ` regular semisimple ' if its centralizer in @xmath0 has order coprime to @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite simple group of lie type of characteristic @xmath40 and let @xmath41 be a semisimple element .",
    "let @xmath42 be conjugacy classes of regular semisimple elements of @xmath0 . then there exist elements @xmath43 and @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .    to ensure that the conjugacy part of the definition of a beauville structure is satisfied we aim to choose @xmath46 such that @xmath47 is coprime to @xmath48 .",
    "this is made possible by a classical theorem of zsigmondy @xcite ( or rather bang @xcite in the case @xmath49 . ) whilst @xcite and @xcite are over a century old and therefore difficult to read and get hold of , a more recent account of a proof is given by lnburg in @xcite .",
    "[ zig ] for any positive integers @xmath29 and @xmath50 there exists a prime that divides @xmath51 but not @xmath52 for any @xmath53 with the following exceptions :    * @xmath54 and @xmath55 ; and * @xmath56 is a power of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the real significance of the above results stems from the fact that most groups of lie type have an order that is a product of numbers of the form @xmath59 and so the above result guarantees the existence of a rich supply of distinct primes that can be taken as being the orders of the elements of our beauville structure .",
    "it remains to decide if a given triple will generate the group .",
    "since our elements have orders given by theorem [ zig ] we can use a theorem of guralnick , pentilla , praeger and saxl @xcite concerning subgroups of the general linear group @xmath60 containing elements of these orders and closely related results of niemeyer and praeger @xcite for the other classical groups to show that no proper subgroups contain our elements .",
    "it follows that our chosen elements will generate the group .",
    "the abelian beauville groups were essentially classified by catanese in @xcite and the full argument is given explicitly in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.4 ) where the following is proved .",
    "[ abthm ] let @xmath0 be an abelian group .",
    "then @xmath0 is a beauville group if , and only if , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is coprime to @xmath63 .",
    "this explains why beauville s original example used the group @xmath7 - it is the smallest abelian beauville group .",
    "theorem [ abthm ] has been put to great use by gonzlez - diez , jones and torres - teigell in @xcite where several structural results concerning the surfaces defined by abelian beauville groups are proved . for each abelian beauville group",
    "they describe all the surfaces arising from that group , enumerate them up to isomorphism and impose constraints on their automorphism groups . as a consequence",
    "they show that all such surfaces are defined over @xmath64 .    after the abelian groups , the next most natural class of finite groups to consider are the nilpotent groups . in ( * ? ?",
    "* lemma 1.3 ) barker , boston and the author note the following easy lemma .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath65 be beauville groups and let @xmath66 and @xmath67 be their respective beauville structures .",
    "suppose that @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "then @xmath70 is a beauville structure for the group @xmath71 .",
    "recall that a finite group is nilpotent if , and only if , it isomorphic to the direct product of its sylow subgroups .",
    "it thus follows that this lemma , and its easy to prove converse , reduces the study of nilpotent beauville groups to that of beauville @xmath40-groups .",
    "note that theorem [ abthm ] gives us infinitely many examples of beauville @xmath40-groups for every prime @xmath72 - simply let @xmath50 be any power of @xmath40 .",
    "early examples of beauville 2-groups and 3-groups were constructed by fuertes , gonzlez - diez and jaikin - zapirain in @xcite where a beauville group of order @xmath73 and another of order @xmath74 were constructed .",
    "even earlier than this , two beauville 2-groups of order @xmath75 arose as part of a classification due to bauer , catanese and grunewald in @xcite of certain classes of surfaces of general type .",
    "more recently , in @xcite barker , boston and the author classified the beauville @xmath40-groups of order at most @xmath76 and made substantial progress on the cases of groups of order @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "in particular , the number of beauville @xmath40-groups of order @xmath76 is two for every @xmath72 and zero otherwise , but for @xmath77 we have the following .    for all @xmath79 ,",
    "the number of beauville @xmath40-groups of order @xmath77 is given by @xmath80 .    in (",
    "* theorem 1.4 ) we prove that there are at least @xmath81 beauville groups of order @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , the above conjecture has been verified computationally for all primes @xmath40 such that @xmath82 .",
    "perhaps more interestingly , other results proved in @xcite verify that the proportion of 2-generated @xmath40-groups of order @xmath77 that are beauville tends to 1 as @xmath40 tends to infinity , however this fails to to be true for @xmath40-groups of order @xmath78 .    if @xmath83 what is the behaviour , as @xmath40 tends to infinity , of the proportion of 2-generated @xmath40-groups that are beauville ?    another consequence of this work was determining the smallest beauville @xmath40-group for all primes . in the below presentations ,",
    "if no relationship between two generators is specified by a relation or relator then it should be assumed that the two generators commute .",
    "the smallest beauville @xmath40-groups are as follows .    * for @xmath84 the group @xmath85 ^ 22 , [ x , y^3]^2 , [ x^2 , y^3]\\rangle\\ ] ] of order @xmath86 . * for @xmath87 the group @xmath88 of order @xmath89 . * for @xmath79 the group @xmath90 = z\\rangle\\ ] ] of order @xmath91 .",
    "further examples are given by the following unpublished constructions due to jones and wolfart .",

    "nigel boston has recently undertaken some substantial and as yet unpublished computations regarding the relationship between @xmath40-groups status as beauville groups and their position on the so - called ` obrien trees ' @xcite .",
    "whilst little global pattern appears to exist in general , there does appear to be some mysterious relationship with an invariant known as the ` nuclear rank ' of the group - see @xcite . since defining this concept",
    "is somewhat involved we shall say no more about this here .",
    "given any complex surface @xmath1 it is natural to consider the complex conjugate surface @xmath104 .",
    "in particular it is natural to ask if the surfaces are biholomorphic .",
    "let @xmath1 be a complex surface .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is * real * if there exists a biholomorphism @xmath105 such that @xmath106 is the identity map .",
    "as noted earlier this geometric condition can be translated into algebraic terms .",
    "let @xmath0 be a beauville group and let @xmath107 be a beauville structure for @xmath0 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 and @xmath108 are * strongly real * if there exists an automorphism @xmath109 and elements @xmath110 for @xmath24 such that @xmath111 for @xmath69 .",
    "it is often , but not always , convenient to take @xmath112 .",
    "our first examples come immediately from theorem [ abthm ] since for any abelian group the function @xmath113 is an automorphism .",
    "[ abcor ] every beauville structure of an abelian beauville group is strongly real .",
    "a little more generally , when it comes to strongly real beauville @xmath40-groups the examples given by theorem [ abthm ] are , as far as the author is aware , the only known examples .",
    "furthermore , the beauville 2-groups constructed by barker , boston , peyerimhoff and vdovina in @xcite are explicitly shown to not be strongly real . however , a combination of corollary [ abcor ] and the fact that @xmath40-groups in general tend to have large automorphism groups @xcite it seems likely that most beauville @xmath40-groups are in fact strongly real beauville groups .",
    "this makes the following problem particularly pressing .",

    "in @xcite the following conjecture , a refinement of an earlier conjecture of bauer , catanese and grunewald ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.4 ) , is made .",
    "all non - abelian finite simple groups apart from a@xmath34 , m@xmath114 and m@xmath115 are strongly real beauville groups .",
    "only a few cases of this conjecture are known .    * in @xcite fuertes and",
    "gonzlez - diez showed that the alternating groups @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) and the symmetric groups @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) are strongly real beauville groups by explicitly writing down permutations for their generators and the automorphisms used and applying some of the classical theory of permutation groups to show that their elements had the properties they claimed .",
    "it was subsequently found that the group a@xmath120 is also strongly real .",
    "* in @xcite fuertes and jones proved that the simple groups @xmath37 for prime powers @xmath121 and the quasisimple groups @xmath122 for prime powers @xmath121 are strongly real beauville groups .",

    "( for a full statement of this result and related theorems as well a detailed historical account of the maximal subgroups of low dimensional classical groups see the excellent survey of king in @xcite . )",
    "general lemmas for lifting structures from a group to its covering groups are also used . * in @xcite the author determined which of the sporadic simple groups are strongly real beauville groups , including the ` 27@xmath123 sporadic simple group ' , the tits group @xmath124 . only the mathieu groups m@xmath114 and m@xmath115 are not strongly real . for all of the other sporadic groups smaller than the baby monster group @xmath125 explicit words in the ` standard generators ' @xcite for a strongly real beauville structure were given . for the baby monster group @xmath125 and monster group @xmath126 character theoretic methods were used . * in @xcite the author also verified this conjecture for the suzuki groups @xmath38 . again , this was achieved by writing down explicit elements of the group which using the list of maximal subgroups of the suzuki group are shown to generate . * in @xcite the author extended earlier computations of bauer , catanese and grunewald , verifying this conjecture for all non - abelian finite simple groups of order at most @xmath127 .",
    "we remark that several of the groups mentioned in the above bullet points are not simple .",
    "more generally we ask the following .    which groups are strongly real beauville groups ?",
    "finally , we remark that in @xcite the author constructs many further examples of strongly real beauville groups .",

    "a split extension of a simple group is a beauville group if , and only if , it is a strongly real beauville group .",
    "when we defined beauville surfaces and groups we considered the action of a group @xmath0 on the product of two curves @xmath10 . in an unmixed structure this action comes solely from the action of @xmath0 on each curve individually , however there is nothing to stop us considering an action on the product that interchanges the two curves and it is precisely this situation that we discuss in this section .",

    "let @xmath185 , @xmath186 be two hyperbolic triples of integers . then @xmath0 admits an unmixed beauville structure of type @xmath187 if , and only if , the following hold :    1 .   the group @xmath0 is a quotient of the triangle groups @xmath188 and @xmath189 with torsion - free kernel ; 2 .",

    "given that generic lists of maximal subgroups of other low rank groups of lie type are well known in numerous other cases , it seems likely that analogous results for these groups can also be obtained .",
    "we thus reiterate bauer , catanese and grunewald s earlier question in this case .",
    "we mentioned in the introduction that beauville surfaces have fundamental groups that are easy to work with . to make this vague remark a little more specific we note the following .",
    "suppose that if @xmath0 is a beauville group with a beauville structure of type @xmath211 , then for @xmath24 there exist surjective homomorphisms @xmath212 .",
    "the direct product ker@xmath213ker@xmath214 is the fundamental group of the product @xmath10 .",
    "the fundamental group of the surface @xmath4 is now an extension of a normal subgroup ker@xmath213ker@xmath214 by @xmath0 , or more precisely the inverse image in @xmath215 of the diagonal subgroup of @xmath216 under the epimorphism @xmath217 .",
    "it turns out that this simple description of the fundamental group is responsible for the rigidity of beauville surfaces and this in turn ensures that the topological and geometric features of the surfaces are closely intertwined - see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 9 ) for details .",
    "unsurprisingly , since a beauville group dictates so many features of its corresponding beauville surface which in turn determines its fundamental group we also have the reverse relationship whereby the fundamental group determines the original beauville group .",
    "the following is proved by gonzlez - diez and torres - teigell @xcite .",
    "( it also worth noting related results given by bauer , catanese and grunewald in @xcite and by catanese in @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental group is one of the most basic tools in algebraic topology .",
    "it is , however , somewhat limited in its usefulness and topologists have found several important higher dimensional analogues of the fundamental group and so it is natural to pose the following question .    do the higher homotopy / homology / cohomology groups of a beauville surface have similar descriptions in terms of triangle groups and the corresponding beauville group and to what extent do they uniquely determine the surface ?    by way of partial progress on this question in @xcite bauer , catanese and",
    "frapporti recently showed that for any beauville surface @xmath1 the homology group @xmath218 is finite .",
    "they also give a much more detailed discussion of geometric aspects of the study of fundamental groups of beauville surfaces and related objects as well as computer calculations of these objects in some cases .      in @xcite jones",
    "investigated the automorphism groups of unmixed beauville surfaces .",
    "some of these results were obtained independently by fuertes and gonzlez - diez in @xcite and were later extended to mixed beauville surfaces by gonzlez - diez and torres - teigell in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.3 ) .",
    "the automorphism group aut(@xmath1 ) of a beauville surface @xmath219 has a normal subgroup inn(@xmath220 with aut(@xmath221 isomorphic to a subgroup of the wreath product @xmath222 .",
    "in particular aut(@xmath1 ) is a finite soluble group of order dividing @xmath223 and of derived length at most @xmath144 .    here",
    "the subgroup inn(@xmath1 ) consists of automorphisms preserving the two curves ( or more precisely , induced by automorphisms of @xmath224 preserving them ) though it does not necessarily contain all of them : they form a subgroup of index at most @xmath57 in aut(@xmath1 ) , whereas inn(@xmath1 ) can have index up to 72 .",
    "the results in the mixed case are similar .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite group .",
    "the * beauville genus spectrum * of @xmath0 is the set @xmath225 of pairs of integers @xmath226 such that @xmath227 and there are curves @xmath2 and @xmath3 of genera @xmath228 and @xmath229 with an action of @xmath0 on @xmath10 such that @xmath4 is a beauville surface .    by the riemann - hurwitz formula",
    "each @xmath230 is bounded above by @xmath231 and so this set is always finite .",
    "fuertes , gonzlez - diez and jaikin - zapirain determine the beauville spectra of several small groups .",
    "unpublished calculations of the author s phd student , emilio pierro , has added a few more finite simple and almost simple groups to the above list , the largest being the mathieu group m@xmath115 .",
    "furthermore , the beauville genus structures of @xmath37 and @xmath181 may be deduced from the results discussed in subsection [ garsec ] .",
    "this naturally leads us to ask the following .",
    "if we fix @xmath150 then for large values of @xmath129 the group @xmath237 will not be 2-generated and therefore will not be beauville . for more modest values of @xmath129 there is , however , still hope .",
    "these groups have recently been investigated by jones in @xcite where the following conjecture is investigated .",
    "theorem [ simpthm ] shows that this conjecture is true for the characteristically simple group @xmath237 in the case @xmath238 for every non - abelian finite simple group @xmath150 .",
    "if @xmath0 is abelian then this conjecture holds by theorem [ abthm ] following the convention that a cyclic group is not considered to be 2-generated . in [ 39 ] the above conjecture is verified for the alternating groups and in @xcite it is verified for the linear groups @xmath37 and @xmath239 , the unitary groups @xmath170 , the suzuki groups @xmath38 , the small ree groups @xmath39 and the sporadic simple groups .",
    "in addition to the above the author has performed computations that verify the above conjecture for all characteristically simple groups of order at most @xmath240 . as an amusing aside",
    "we note that this shows that whilst a@xmath34 is not a beauville group , the direct product of nineteen copies of a@xmath34 is !",
    "it is likely that many larger direct products are also strongly real , however the precise statement of a conjecture along these lines is likely to be much more complicated .",
    "for example , a straightforward computation verifies that neither of the groups m@xmath241m@xmath241m@xmath114 and m@xmath242m@xmath242m@xmath115 are strongly real despite the fact that both of the groups m@xmath241m@xmath241m@xmath241m@xmath114 and m@xmath242m@xmath242m@xmath242m@xmath115 are .    the above conjecture has been verified for the alternating groups ( though slightly stronger results are true in this case ) , the sporadic simple groups , the linear groups @xmath37 ( @xmath121 ) , the suzuki groups @xmath38 , the sporadic simple groups ( including the mathieu groups @xmath243 and @xmath244 , despite the statement of conjecture 5.5 ) and all of the finite simple groups of order at most @xmath245 .",
    "the task of understanding the absolute galois group gal(@xmath8 ) is of central importance in algebraic number theory and is related to the inverse galois problem ( it is equivalent to asking if every finite group is a quotient of gal(@xmath8 ) under a topologically closed normal subgroup ) and this is arguably the hardest open problem in algebra today . as things stand gal(@xmath8 ) remains very poorly understood .",
    "a natural approach to understanding any group is to study some action(s ) of the group .",
    "an immeidate consequence of bely s theorem is that gal(@xmath8 ) acts on the set of all beauville surfaces .",
    "recently there has been much interest in constructing orbits consisting of mutually non - homeomorphic pairs of beauville surfaces . in @xcite",
    "gonzlez - diez , jones and torres - teigell have constructed arbitrarily large orbits of gal(@xmath8 ) consisting of mutually non - homeomorphic pairs of beauville surfaces defined by the beauville groups @xmath37 and @xmath181 .      a slightly different motivation for addressing the above problem comes from the following . knowing whether or not gal(@xmath8 ) acts faithfully on the set of beauville surfaces is equivalent to the longstanding question of whether or not gal(@xmath8 ) acts faithfully on the set of regular dessins .",
    "this was recently resolved by gonzlez - diez and jaikin - zapirain in @xcite by showing that gal(@xmath8 ) acts faithfully on the set of beauville surfaces .",
