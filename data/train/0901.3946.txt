    "quantum walks were designed as quantum counterparts of classical random walks , a branch of stochastic processes widely used in algorithm development . although some authors have selected the name quantum random walk  to refer to quantum phenomena @xcite and , in fact , in the seminal work by r.p .",
    "feynman @xcite about quantum mechanical computers we find a proposal that could be interpreted as a ( continuous - time ) quantum walk @xcite , it is generally accepted that the first paper with quantum walks as its main topic was published in 1993 by aharonov _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "thus , the links between classical random walks and quantum walks , as well as the utility of quantum walks in computer science , are two fresh and open areas of research .",
    "since one of the main goals in quantum computing is the development of quantum algorithms , and given the success of employing classical random walks for computing solutions to np - complete problems @xcite , there has been a huge interest in understanding the physical and computational properties of quantum walks over the last few years on both experimental @xcite and theoretical research communities ( see @xcite for a review on theoretical aspects of quantum walks ) .",
    "in addition to their usage in computer science , the study of quantum walks is relevant to the modelling of physical phenomena such as energy transfer in photosynthetic systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , although it has been proved that certain properties of quantum walks are also reproducible by classical systems ( like variance enhancement with respect to classical random walks @xcite ) , it is also true that uniquely quantum mechanical properties of quantum walks , such as entanglement , may be employed to building methods in order to test the quantumness  of emerging technologies for the creation of quantum computers .",
    "thus it is of crucial importance to develop methods of entanglement generation through quantum walks so that the genuine quantum nature of a given walk with given physical systems may be tested .",
    "quantum entanglement has been incorporated into quantum walks research either as a result of performing a quantum walk @xcite or as a resource to build new kinds of quantum walks @xcite .",
    "since entanglement is a key component in quantum computation , it is worth keeping in mind that quantum walks can be used either as entanglement generators or as computational processes taking advantage of this quantum mechanical property .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a novel algorithm based on a discrete quantum walk on a line with one coin and two walkers whose purpose is to generate entanglement between walkers . after evolving the quantum walk for a certain number of steps ,",
    "we perform a measurement on the coin state .",
    "we then obtain a post - measurement quantum state composed by the tensor product of one coin state and several walker components .",
    "we take the walker components of this post - measurement state and calculate the entanglement between walkers .",
    "we perform many quantum walks with the same initial conditions and evolution operators , so that we have a quantum walk ready to be measured for each time step .",
    "in addition to our algorithm , we provide several simulation results using different initial conditions for the proposed quantum walks . while this analysis highlights the potential of a quantum walk to entangle high dimensional quantum systems ( the dimension of the space available to the walkers grow in each step ) it can also at times be practically useful",
    ". this will be the case when the walkers are systems which do not directly interact with each other such as two different electromagnetic field modes .",
    "then the coin can be a common system such as an atom which interact with both and can entangle them to a high degree with the degree depending on the number of steps possible within the reasonable decoherence time of the fields .",
    "in this section we present our algorithm for the generation of entanglement in a family of quantum walks on an unrestricted line .",
    "a succint mathematical representation of a quantum walk after @xmath0 steps is    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the initial total state of the quantum walk . in our case",
    ", the family of quantum walks we shall employ is composed by the tensor product of one coin and two walkers    @xmath3    as total initial state .",
    "after several applications of an evolution operator composed of a coin operator and a shift operator , we perform a measurement on the coin state .",
    "the result of this operation is a post - measurement quantum state composed by the tensor product of one coin state and several walker components .",
    "we take the walker components of this coin post - measurement state and calculate the entanglement between walkers using the von neumann entropy    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the schmidt decomposition of a bipartite quantum state @xmath6 .",
    "we compute @xmath0 quantum walks using the same initial states and evolution operator in order to measure the degree of entanglement between walkers _ for each step _ , so that the final result of this algorithm is a graph with the amount of entanglement available at each step .",
    "we summarize this explanation in algorithm 1 .",

    "( [ five_initial_condition ] ) .",
    "as opposed to previous cases in which asymptotical values of entanglement between walkers were different for post - measurement states @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we can see in figs .",
    "( [ fifth_condition_coin_zero ] ) and ( [ fifth_condition_coin_one ] ) that the asymptotics of both entanglement curves tend to the same efficiency of 85% approximately .",

    "( [ fifth_condition_entanglement_comparison].ii ) where we show that both entanglement curves overlap .",
    "we have proposed an algorithm to generate entanglement between walkers , after measuring the coin state , for a hadamard quantum walk with one ( 2-dimensional ) coin and two walkers .",
    "our numerical simulations show that , asymptotically , the amount of entanglement generated between walkers does not reach the highest degree of entanglement possible at each step ( purely from the dimensionality of the space explored by the walkers in a given step ) for either coin measurement outcome .",
    "nevertheless , our simulations also show that the entanglement ratio ( @xmath59 entanglement generated / highest value of entanglement possible , for each step ) tends to converge to a rather high value ( for example , to @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) , and the actual convergence value seems to depend on the coin initial state and on the coin measurement outcome .",
    "convergence of entanglement ratio leads to a most interesting result : the actual value towards which the entanglement ratio converges , for each coin measurement outcome , depends on the symmetry of the coin initial state .",
    "however , the relationship is not straightforward , as it is possible to find two coin initial states ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) such that , although both produce balanced probability distributions , only one coin initial state ( @xmath64 ) makes the asymptotical values of entanglement , for both coin measurements , converge to the same value .",
    "going to two walkers and exploring their entanglement can thereby reveal differences in two quantum walks which are not differentiated easily in the usual case of a single walker .",
    "a noteworthy feature of our algorithm is the high amount of the entanglement generated between the walkers which grows with the number of steps .",
    "our scheme is particularly applicable in physical realizations where the coin is a qubit ( such as an atom or a superconducting qubit ) which interacts with a distinct physical system ( such as an electromagnetic field mode ) acting as a walker @xcite . taking two such walkers , each being a distinct system",
    ", one can probe how entanglement is generated between them through our algorithm .",
    "as such walkers do not naturally interact with each other , using the coin ( qubit ) system is the only way to entangle them .",
    "a recent circuit qed suggestion for the physical implementation of a quantum walk @xcite even estimate a walk of a significant number of steps to be carried out within the decoherence times of the relevant physical systems .",
    "simply enhancing such schemes to two walkers would enable observing the entanglement generation mechanism that we have presented and analyzed in this paper .",
