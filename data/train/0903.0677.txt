    "the problem of random walks ( diffusion ) is a major theme and understanding its behavior is central to a wide range of applications  @xcite . among various interesting issues of random walks , trapping plays a significant role in an increasing number of disciplines , e.g. , physics  @xcite , society  @xcite , computer  @xcite , and biology  @xcite , to name a few .",
    "the classic trapping issue first introduced in  @xcite is a random - walk problem , in which a trap is placed at a given location , absorbing all walkers that visit it .",
    "an important quantity related to trapping problem is the trapping time ( first - passage time , survival time , or the mean walk length ) or the mean time to absorption .",
    "the trapping time of a given site @xmath0 is the expected time for a walker starting from @xmath0 to first reach the trap .",
    "this quantity is useful in the study of transport - limited reactions  @xcite , target search  @xcite and other physical problems .",
    "the average trapping time , also known as the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) , characterizes the process of trapping .",
    "it is defined as the average of survival times over all starting sites .    in the past few decades",
    ", there has been considerable interest in computing the mean first - passage time , in order to obtain the dependence of this primary quantity on the system size or other parameters . in a seminal work ,",
    "using the approach based on generating functions , montroll derived the rigorous results for mfpt of random walks on regular lattices with a variety of dimensions  @xcite . recently , by applying a decimation procedure , kozak and balakrishnan obtained the accurate solutions for mfpt on a family of sierpinski fractals  @xcite ; using an analogous but different method , agliari got the exact expression for the mfpt for a random walker on t - fractal  @xcite . in spite of these rigorous results ,",
    "the explicit determination of mfpt for random walks with a trap on other media is still open  @xcite .",
    "it is well established that the scaling of mfpt is related to the underlying structural properties of the media in which the walkers are confined  @xcite .",
    "extensive empirical studies  @xcite have revealed that most real networked systems share some striking features , such as scale - free behavior  @xcite and small - world effects  @xcite .",
    "these newly - found properties have a profound effect on almost all dynamical processes taking place on the networks  @xcite , including disease spreading  @xcite , games  @xcite , synchronization  @xcite , and so on . very recently",
    ", a lot of activities have been devoted to the study of influences of scale - free and small - world characteristics on the behavior of random walks , uncovering many unusual and exotic phenomena about random walks  @xcite . however , to best of our knowledge , rigorous solution for mfpt of trapping problem on scale - free small - world networks is missing .    in this paper , we study the classic trapping problem on a deterministic network , called pseudofractal scale - free web ( psfw )  @xcite .",
    "we focus on a peculiar case with the trap fixed at a hub node ( node with the highest degree ) .",
    "the psfw is a very useful toy model that captures simultaneously scale - free small - world properties , thus provides a good facility to investigate analytically trapping process upon it .",
    "we derive an exact formula for the mean first - passage time characterizing the trapping process .",
    "the analytic approach is based on an algebraic iterative procedure obtained from the particular construction of psfw .",
    "the obtained rigorous result shows that the mfpt grows as a power - law function of the number of network nodes with the exponent less than 1 , which implies that in contrast to regular lattices , sierpinski fractals , and t - graph , the psfw tends to speed up the diffusion process .",
    "our study opens the way to theoretically investigate the mfpt of a random walker on a wide range of deterministic networks  @xcite .",
    "here we introduce the pseudofractal scale - free web defined in a recursive way  @xcite , which has attracted an amount of attention  @xcite .",
    "we investigate the psfw model because of its intrinsic interest and its deterministic construction , which allows one to study analytically their topological properties and dynamical processes on it .",
    "the pseudofractal scale - free web , denoted by @xmath1 after @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) generation evolution , is constructed as follows . for @xmath4",
    ", @xmath5 is a triangle of edges connecting three nodes ( vertices , sites ) . for @xmath6 , @xmath1",
    "is obtained from @xmath7 : every existing edge in @xmath7 introduces a new node connected to both ends of the edge .",
    "figure  [ network ] illustrates the construction process for the first three generations .        according to the network construction",
    ", one can see that at each step @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) the number of newly introduced nodes is @xmath10 . from this result",
    ", we can easily compute the network order ( i.e. , the total number of nodes ) @xmath11 at step @xmath2 : @xmath12    let @xmath13 be the degree of a node @xmath14 at time @xmath2 , which entered the network at step @xmath8 ( @xmath15 ) . then @xmath16 from eq .  ( [ ki ] ) , one can easily see that at each step the degree of a node doubles , i.e. , @xmath17    the psfw presents some typical characteristics of real - life networks in nature and society .",
    "it has a power - law degree distribution @xmath18 with the exponent @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "its average path length ( apl ) , defined as the mean of shortest distance between all pairs of nodes , increases logarithmically with network order  @xcite . in the large network order limit , the average clustering coefficient tends to @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the psfw exhibits small - world behavior  @xcite .",
    "in addition , its node degree correlations are negative , the average degree of nearest neighbors , @xmath21 , for nodes with degree @xmath22 is approximately a power - law function of @xmath22 with a negative exponent @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "while the graph introduced above visually looks very similar to a fractal ( see fig .  [ network ] ) , the similarities are only superficial .",
    "the distinction is obvious .",
    "fractals have a finite dimension ( i.e. , their apl grows as a power of the vertex number )  @xcite . in sharp contrast",
    ", the network under consideration has an infinite dimension ( i.e. , its apl increases slower than any power of the network order )  @xcite .",
    "this is why it is called _ pseudofractal scale - free web_.    after introducing the psfw , in what follows we will study the mean first - passage time for random walks with a single immobile trap on the web , by applying a method similar to but different from that introduced in  @xcite .",
    "in this section we formulate the problem of a simple unbiased markovian random walk of a particle on psfw @xmath24 in the presence of a trap or a perfect absorber located on a given node . in order to distinguish different nodes , we label all the nodes belonging to @xmath24 in the following way .",
    "the initial three nodes in @xmath25 are labeled as 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . in each new generation , only the new nodes created at this generation are labeled , while the labels of all old nodes remain unchanged , i.e. , we label new nodes as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the total number of the pre - existing nodes and @xmath28 is the number of newly - created nodes .",
    "eventually , every node is labeled by a unique integer , at time @xmath2 all nodes are labeled from 1 to @xmath29 , see fig .",
    "[ network ] .",
    "we locate the trap at node 1  @xcite , denoted as @xmath30 .",
    "note that the particular selection we made for the trap location makes the analytical computation process ( that will be shown in detail in the next section ) easily iterated as we can identify the trap node @xmath30 since the first generation . at each time step ( taken to be unity ) , the particle , starting from any node except the trap @xmath30 , moves to any of its nearest neighbors with equal probability .",
    "it is easily seen that in the presence of the trap @xmath30 fixed on node 1 , the walker ( particle ) will be inevitably absorbed  @xcite .",
    "this random walk process can be described by a specifying the set of transition probabilities @xmath31 for the particle of going from node @xmath14 to node @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , all the entries constitute a matrix @xmath33 that is a @xmath34-order sub - matrix of @xmath35 with the first row and column corresponding to trap being removed , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are separately the adjacency matrix and diagonal degree matrix of @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath38 be survival time for a walker initially placed at node @xmath14 to first reach the trap @xmath30 .",
    "then , the set of this interesting quantity obeys the following recurrence equation  @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "( [ mfpt1 ] ) expresses the markovian property of the random walk , it may be recast in matrix notation as @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( the superscript @xmath43 of the vector represents transpose ) is a ( @xmath44)-dimensional vector , @xmath45 is the ( @xmath44)-dimensional unit vector @xmath46 , and @xmath33 is the transition matrix . from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt2 ] ) , we can easily obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 in which @xmath49 is an identity matrix with an order @xmath50 .",
    "equation  ( [ mfpt4 ] ) is the fundamental matrix of the markov chain representing the unbiased random walk . actually , the matrix @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ mfpt4 ] ) is the normalized discrete laplacian matrix of @xmath24 whose first row and column that correspond to the trap node have been deleted .",
    "then , the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) , or the average of the mean time to absorption , @xmath52 , which is the average of @xmath38 over all initial nodes distributed uniformly over nodes in @xmath24 other than the trap , is given by @xmath53    equation  ( [ mfpt5 ] ) can be easily explained from the markov chain representing the random walk .",
    "in fact , the entry @xmath54 of the fundamental matrix @xmath55 for the markov process denotes the expected number of times that the process is in the transient state @xmath32 , being started in the transient state @xmath14 .",
    "the quantity of mfpt is very important since it measures the efficiency of the trapping process : the smaller the mfpt , the higher the efficiency , and vice versa .",
    "equation  ( [ mfpt5 ] ) shows that the problem of calculating @xmath52 is reduced to finding the sum of all elements of matrix @xmath55 .",
    "notice that the order of @xmath55 is @xmath50 , where @xmath11 increases exponentially with @xmath2 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ nt ] ) .",
    "so , for large @xmath2 , it becomes difficult to obtain @xmath52 through direct calculation from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt5 ] ) , one can compute directly the mfpt only for the first several generations , see table  [ tab : amta1 ] . however , the recursive construction of psfw allows one to compute analytically mfpt to achieve a closed - form solution , the derivation details of which will be given in next section .",
    ".the average of the mean time to absorption obtained by direct calculation from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt5 ] ) . since for large networks , the computation of the mfpt from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt5 ] ) is prohibitively time and memory consuming , we calculate the mfpt for only the first several generations . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the numerical values listed in table [ tab : amta2 ] show that for a given node @xmath14 we have @xmath56 .",
    "that is to say , upon growth of psfw from @xmath2 to generation @xmath57 , the mean time to first reach the trap doubles .",
    "for example , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and so on . this is a basic character of random walks on the psfw , which can be established from the arguments below .",
    "consider an arbitrary node @xmath14 in the psfw @xmath24 after @xmath2 generation evolution of the network . from eq .",
    "( [ ki ] ) , we know that upon growth of psfw to generation @xmath57 , the degree @xmath61 of node @xmath14 doubles",
    ". let the mean transmit time for going from node @xmath14 to any of its @xmath61 old neighbors be @xmath62 ; and let the mean transmit time for going from any of its @xmath61 new neighbors to one of the @xmath61 old neighbors be @xmath63 . then we can establish the following underlying backward equations @xmath64 which leads to @xmath65 .",
    "that is to say , the passage time from any node @xmath14 ( @xmath66 ) to any node @xmath32 ( @xmath67 ) increases by a factor of 2 , upon the network growth from generation @xmath2 to generation @xmath57 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath56 , which will be useful for deriving the formula for the mean first - passage time in the following text .      having obtained the scaling of mean transmit time for old nodes , we now determine the average of the mean time to absorption , aiming to derive an exact solution .",
    "we represent the set of nodes in @xmath1 as @xmath68 , and denote the set of nodes created at generation @xmath2 by @xmath69 .",
    "thus we have @xmath70 . for the convenience of computation",
    ", we define the following quantities for @xmath71 : @xmath72 and @xmath73 then , we have @xmath74 next we will explicitly determine the quantity @xmath75 . to this end",
    ", we should firstly determine @xmath76 .",
    "we examine the mean time to absorption for the first several generations of psfw . in the case of @xmath77 , by construction of the psfw",
    ", it follows that @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "thus , @xmath81 similarly , for @xmath82 case , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , so that @xmath92 proceeding analogously , it is not difficult to derive that @xmath93 and @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are indeed the numbers of nodes generated at generations @xmath2 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "equation  ( [ mfpt13 ] ) minus eq .",
    "( [ mfpt12 ] ) times 4 and making use of the relation @xmath56 , one gets @xmath97 which may be rewritten as @xmath98 using @xmath99 , eq .  ( [ mfpt15 ] ) is solved inductively @xmath100 substituting eq .",
    "( [ mfpt16 ] ) for @xmath101 into eq .",
    "( [ mfpt9 ] ) , we have @xmath102 considering the initial condition @xmath103 , eq .",
    "( [ mfpt17 ] ) is resolved by induction to yield @xmath104 plugging the last expression into eq .",
    "( [ mfpt5 ] ) , we arrive at the accurate formula for the average of the mean time to absorption at the trap located at node 1 on the @xmath2th of the pseudofractal scale - free web : @xmath105 we have checked our analytic formula against numerical values quoted in table  [ tab : amta1 ] . for the range of @xmath106 , the values obtained from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt19 ] ) completely agree with those numerical results on the basis of the direct calculation through eq .",
    "( [ mfpt5 ] ) .",
    "this agreement serves as an independent test of our theoretical formula .",
    "we continue to show how to represent mfpt as a function of network order , with the aim of obtaining the scaling between these two quantities .",
    "recalling eq .",
    "( [ nt ] ) , we have @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "hence , eq .  ( [ mfpt19 ] ) can be recast as @xmath109 for large network , i.e. , @xmath110 , @xmath111 where the exponent @xmath112 .",
    "thus , in the large limit of network order @xmath11 , the mfpt increases algebraically with increasing order of the network .",
    "the above scaling of the mfpt with network order is different from those previously obtained for other media .",
    "for example , on regular lattices with large order @xmath113 , the leading behavior of mfpt @xmath114 is @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 for dimensions @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "again for instance , on planar sierpinski gasket  @xcite and sierpinski tower  @xcite in 3 euclidean dimensions , the asymptotic behavior scales separately as @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "at last , on t - fractal , the leading asymptotic scaling behaves as @xmath123  @xcite .",
    "thus , in contrast to regular lattices , sierpinski fractals , and t - fractal , the trapping process on the pseudofractal scale - free web is more efficient .",
    "it is expected that the efficiency of trapping process on stochastic scale - free networks is also high , since they have similar structural features as the psfw .",
    "why is the mfpt for the pfsw far smaller than that for other lattices ?",
    "we speculate that the heterogeneity of the pseudofractal scale - free web is responsible for this distinction , which may be seen from the following heuristic argument . in the pfsw , there are a few nodes with large degree that are connected to most nodes in the web , which results in the logarithmic scaling of the average path length with network order  @xcite . a walker starting from some node",
    "will arrive at ` large ' nodes with ease .",
    "since ` large ' nodes , including the trap node , are linked to one another , so the walker can find the trap in a short time . while for other regular lattices , they are almost homogeneous , and their average path lengths are much larger than that of the pfsw .",
    "this leads to a long mfpt .",
    "it should be noted that we only give a possible explanation for the shorter mfpt on the pfsw , the genuine reason for this deserves further study in the future .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the classic trapping problem on a deterministically growing network , named pseudofractal scale - free web ( psfw ) that can reproduce some remarkable properties of various real - life networks , such as scale - free feature and small - world behavior , and thus can mimic some real systems to some extent ( to what extent it does is still an open question ) . with the help of recursion relations derived from the structure of psfw , we have obtained the solution for the mfpt for random walks on psfw , with a trap fixed at a hub node .",
    "the exact result shows that the mfpt increases as a power - law function of network order with the exponent less than 1 , which is in contrast to the well - known previously obtained results that for regular lattices , sierpinski fractals , and t - graph with order @xmath113 , their mfpt @xmath124 behaves as @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , the structure of psfw has a profound impact on the trapping problem on it . to the best of our knowledge , our result may be the first exact scaling about mfpt for random walks on scale - free small - world networks .",
    "we should stress that although we have only computed the mfpt for a particular deterministic network , our analytical technique could guide and shed light on related studies for other deterministic networks by providing a paradigm for calculating the mfpt .",
    "moreover , since exact solutions can serve for a guide to and a test of approximate solutions or numerical simulations , we also believe our accurate closed - form solutions can prompt related studies on stochastic networks . at last , as future work , it is interesting to compute higher moments of trapping time for the psfw and compare the scaling with that of homogeneous fractal lattices  @xcite .",
    "another future job of interest is to study the case when the trap is mobile instead of being fixed at one of the hub nodes of the web .",
