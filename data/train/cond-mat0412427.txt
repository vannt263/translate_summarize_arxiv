    "the modern intuition of the emergence of the second law of thermodynamics from mechanics is mainly grounded upon the behaviour of stochastic urn models , where `` particles '' are subjected to a _",
    "probabilistic dynamics _ that eventually generates a sort of thermodynamic equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "obviously , this stochastic ( markovian ) dynamics is only a caricature of the `` real '' ( newtonian ) dynamics ; it is much like an effective dynamics which emerges after averaging over many instances of the complicated short - time motion .    in the classical ehrenfest model",
    ", @xmath2 numbered balls are distributed into two urns ; at each step of the process , a ball is extracted at random and moved from the urn where it resides to the other .",
    "eventually , the number of balls in each urn fluctuates around @xmath3 , with relative deviations from the mean becoming negligible in the large-@xmath2 limit .",
    "this stochastic process is taken to represent the attainment of particle - number equilibrium in a dilute gas diffusing between two communicating vessels of equal volume .    in order to improve the ehrenfest model",
    "so as to make it more realistic , i consider a generalization where the balls / particles are endowed with both a discrete position and a continuous velocity . to be more specific , we are given two boxes , 1 and 2 , and @xmath2 particles in the boxes .",
    "box 1 ( 2 ) is divided into @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) identical cells , with @xmath6 the total cell number .",
    "the occupancy @xmath7 of the @xmath8-th cell can be either multiple ( @xmath9 ) or single ( @xmath10 ) , with both possibilities being considered .",
    "the velocity of the @xmath11-th particle is @xmath12 , a three - dimensional vector with components @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .    to make things simple ,",
    "positions and velocities are updated independently and by turns , in such a way that the two dynamics of free motion and collisions will proceed in parallel though staying separate .",
    "hence , the stationary state of each set of variables can be analysed on its own . along this route ,",
    "one arrives at a probabilistic foundation of the expression of the ideal - gas entropy in thermodynamics and , concurrently , at a justification ( in this case only ) of the maximum - entropy principle .",
    "let us first suppose that each cell can host whatever number of particles .",
    "a position update consists of i ) choosing at random one particle , @xmath15 , and one cell , @xmath16 ; and ii ) moving @xmath15 from its original cell into @xmath16 . in terms of the variable @xmath17 , which counts how many particles",
    "are hosted in box 1 , this defines a stochastic process of the markov type , with transition probabilities : @xmath18 the ensuing master equation admits the _ binomial _ distribution @xmath19 as unique stationary distribution  @xcite . since the markov chain is ergodic ( _ i.e. _ , there is a path connecting every ( macro)state @xmath17 to every other @xmath20 ) , any initial distribution @xmath21 will converge , in the long run , to @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , the average @xmath17 goes eventually into @xmath23 , with relative deviations from the mean of @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the multiplicity of macrostate @xmath17 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of complexions ( microstates ) of @xmath2 numbered particles in the boxes , such that box 1 contains @xmath17 particles , is just @xmath25 . assuming @xmath26 , the equilibrium entropy @xmath27 , defined as the logarithm of the multiplicity , is additive over the boxes and extensive with @xmath2 : @xmath28 being maximum for @xmath29 . in eq([eq03 ] ) , we recognize the volume contribution to the ideal - gas entropy .    while all of the above is rather standard ,",
    "a novel result is obtained when each cell in the boxes can contain at most one particle .",
    "now , at each step in the process , the selected particle @xmath15 is moved into a cell @xmath16 that is chosen at random among the vacant sites .",
    "the transition probabilities read ( with @xmath30 ) : @xmath31 yielding a _ hypergeometric _ stationary distribution for @xmath17  @xcite : @xmath32 as in the previous case , the average @xmath17 converges eventually to @xmath23 , with relative deviations of @xmath24 . the multiplicity of state @xmath17 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of ways @xmath2 indistinguishable particles can be arranged in the boxes , in such a way that @xmath17 particles are placed in box 1 , is equal to @xmath33 .",
    "assuming @xmath34 , the equilibrium entropy becomes : @xmath35 being maximum for @xmath29 .",
    "equation ( [ eq06 ] ) is nothing but the thermodynamic entropy of two ideal _ lattice _ gases that can mutually exchange energy and particles .",
    "the collision dynamics of equal - mass particles can be roughly schematized as a succession of _ random _ binary events which , however , are still required to obey energy and momentum conservation  @xcite . on the macroscopic side , such collision rules go along with the conservation of total _ kinetic _ energy and total momentum , thus being appropriate only to a very dilute ( gaseous ) system of particles . if , moreover , we are willing to drop the momentum constraint , provision should be made also for elastic collisions against the walls of the ( cubic ) container .",
    "as far as the mutual collisions are concerned , i assume their outcome to be as maximally random as possible . this amounts to update the velocities of the colliding particles as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is picked up at random out of the emisphere of unit - length vectors forming an acute angle with @xmath39 .",

    "\\label{eq10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any function @xmath51 , the _ ansatz _ @xmath52 gives a stationary solution to eq.([eq10 ] ) .",
    "however , in case of an isolated system with total energy @xmath53 , the only admissible solution to eq.([eq08 ] ) is the microcanonical density @xmath54  @xcite , and the @xmath51 function becomes : @xmath55 leading in turn to : @xmath56 the latter is the finite-@xmath2 maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) distribution  @xcite . in the @xmath57 limit ( with @xmath58 ) , one recovers from eq.([eq12 ] ) the more familiar gaussian form , @xmath59 , with @xmath60 ( corresponding to an average @xmath61 of @xmath62 for all @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xmath44 i have carried out a computer simulation of the evolution encoded in eq.([eq08 ] ) in order to check whether the stationary distribution ( [ eq12 ] ) is also an asymptotic solution , as expected ( at least when @xmath63 ) from the ergodicity of kernel ( [ eq09 ] ) .",
    "first , i set @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 .",
    "starting at any particular microstate with energy @xmath53 , i collect in a hystogram the values , at regular time intervals , of the three components of particle-1 velocity ( see fig.1 left ) .",
    "indeed , this hystogram has , in the long run , the finite-@xmath2 mb form .",
    "this is indirect evidence that the simulation trajectory samples uniformly , at least effectively if not literally , the @xmath67-dimensional hypersurface of energy @xmath53 .    afterwards , i take @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and follow the evolution of the same hystogram as above , now starting from velocity values extracted at random from _ e.g. _ a uniform one - particle distribution of variance @xmath70 .",
    "the long - run distribution of velocity no.1 compares well with a gaussian ( fig.1 right ) , that is with the large-@xmath2 form of the mb distribution .",
    "in fact , also the instantaneous velocities of all particles are asymptotically distributed , for large @xmath2 , according to the same gaussian ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "this indicates that : 1 ) the vast majority of points in the energy hypersurface is made of `` typical '' states , _",
    "i.e. _ , microstates that look more or less similar as far as low - order distributions like @xmath71 are concerned ; and 2 ) the microstate at which the evolution was started is , indeed , untypical  @xcite .",
    "@xmath44 for a given number @xmath17 of particles in box 1 , the equilibrium probability density @xmath72 of their total energy @xmath73 can be calculated exactly for @xmath74 : @xmath75 that is , variable @xmath76 is _",

    "of all @xmath17-velocity microstates , the fraction of those states whose energy lies between @xmath73 and @xmath78 is @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) . in particular , the boltzmann entropy associated with eq.([eq13 ] ) is , for @xmath26 : @xmath81 which , when including also the configurational term ( [ eq03 ] ) or ( [ eq06 ] ) , gives back the expression of the entropy of the ( monoatomic ) ideal gas .    in conclusion ,",
    "i have introduced a stochastic process of the ehrenfest type which allows one to found microscopically the expression of the thermodynamic entropy of an ideal gas , without relying on the hypothesis of equal _ a priori _ probability of all microstates .",
    "rather , the validity of the latter , at least in an effective sense , follows as an outcome from the stochastic dynamics itself . in thermodynamics ,",
    "the second law requires the maximization of the total entropy @xmath82 under the given constraints ( here , the total number of particles @xmath2 and the total energy @xmath53 of two ideal gases in grand - canonical contact ) in order to find the equilibrium state of an overall isolated system . in the present model , this very same",
