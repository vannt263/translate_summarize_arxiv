    "= 8.7 cm    the results of the rxte observations of sax j1808.43658 can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the 3100 kev spectrum maintained an approximate power law shape @xmath55 as luminosity decreased by a factor of @xmath0 ( table [ fit ] , fig.[spezoo ] ) .",
    "under the abovementioned assumptions about the reflected component , the lower limit on the exponential cut - off in the intrinsic spectrum averaged over april 1125 is @xmath3 kev .",
    "+ the spectrum differs substantially from the low state spectra of the x  ray bursters often observed at @xmath56 erg / s ( 3150 kev ; e.g. gx3540 , 4u170544 , fig.[spezoo ] ) .",
    "it is similar to the spectra of some x  ray bursters at sufficiently low luminosity @xmath57 erg / s ( e.g. 4u1608522 and aql x1 , fig.[spezoo ] ) .",
    "2 .   the decaying part of the x  ray light curve has a sharp cut off below @xmath58 erg / s ( 4 kpc distance is assumed throughout the paper unless mentioned otherwise )  the luminosity has dropped by a factor of @xmath9 within @xmath59 days .",
    "the rise time was also short : @xmath59 days .",
    "the total energy released in the 3150 kev band was @xmath60 erg , corresponding to an accreted mass of @xmath61 .",
    "the peak value of the mass accretion rate was @xmath62 .",
    "these estimates however do not take into account the energy radiated below 3 kev and above 150 kev which could be non negligible .",
    "the @xmath55 power law spectrum does not continue to the ir band ",
    "@xmath63 ( ir data  from @xcite ) .",
    "theories of the spectral formation in accreting pulsars with a strong magnetic field predict a change of the physical conditions near the surface of the neutron star at @xmath64 erg / sec . in the case of x ",
    "ray bursters strong spectral changes are associated with the transition from the soft to the hard spectral state at @xmath65 erg / sec ( fig.[spezoo ] ) .",
    "we therefore expected to observe spectral evolution as luminosity decreased by a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "remarkably no significant spectral changes were detected ( table [ fit ] , fig.[spezoo ] ) .",
    "this , together with the detection of x  ray pulsations of roughly the same relative amplitude , implies that essentially the same mechanism is responsible for the spectral formation in a broad luminosity range .",
    "stability and shape of the spectrum of sax j1808.43658 suggests considering a possibility , that the 1998 outburst was powered by the standard pulsar emission mechanism . for magnetic dipole emission the field strength required to generate x  ray flux",
    "@xmath66 [ erg / s / cm@xmath16 ] is @xmath68 gauss , where @xmath69 is the distance in kpc , @xmath70  the neutron star radius in @xmath71 cm , @xmath72  rotation period divided by 2.5 msec , @xmath73  the efficiency of the production of x  ray photons . on the other hand",
    "the 1996 outburst was accretion powered as the type i x  ray bursts were detected . for the accretion to proceed uninhibited by the centrifugal force due to the rotating magnetosphere of the neutron star the accretion rate would be @xmath74 g / s i.e. @xmath75 for @xmath76 gauss . therefore , independent of the source distance , the 210 kev flux observed in 1996 ( @xmath77 erg / s / cm@xmath16 ) would correspond to @xmath78 of @xmath79 .",
    "such a low efficiency of production of x  ray photons is unlikely for an accreting neutron star .",
    "moreover , such a high @xmath80 would lead to a steady nuclear burning of the accreting matter , which contradicts the detection of the type i x  ray bursts .",
    "thus , the standard pulsar emission mechanism can be ruled out .",
    "the x  ray light curve is similar to the outburst profiles of two very different types of accreting sources  the neutron star soft x  ray transients ( e.g. @xcite ) and type b outbursts in dwarf novae ( @xcite ) . an abrupt cut - off of the light curve",
    "is also common for the black hole x  ray transients ( @xcite ) .",
    "two different interpretations of the abrupt decline of luminosity at the end of the outburst are possible in the case of sax",
    "j1808.43658 :    1 .",
    "closure of the centrifugal barrier at low accretion rate when the magnetosphere reaches the corotation radius @xmath81 km and the source enters the `` propeller '' regime ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cut - off luminosity provides an estimate of the magnetic field as : @xmath82 gauss .",
    "disk instability .",
    "the decay time scale is defined by the propagation of the cooling wave .",
    "a rough estimate for the sax j1808.43658 binary system parameters is @xmath83 days , @xmath47  viscosity parameter ( @xcite ) which approximately accounts for the observed decay time scale ( fig.[lc ] ) .",
    "the above expression for b is an upper limit in this case .      a possible mechanism resulting in the formation of a power law spectrum with a slope @xmath2 might be comptonization on the bulk motion in a radiation dominated shock ( blandford & payne 1981 , @xcite ) . if , as indicated by the x  ray pulsation , there is non negligible disk ",
    "magnetosphere interaction , the accreting matter is funneled onto the polar caps with @xmath84free fall velocity . if the radiation energy flux @xmath85 exceeds the critical value @xmath86local eddington flux , the radiation dominated shock is formed near the surface of the neutron star at the polar regions ( @xcite ) , where @xmath87 of the accretion energy is released . a naive estimate  assuming that the magnetosphere is close to corotation , the magnetic field inside the magnetosphere is not distorted and the in - falling matter fills the magnetic funnel  gives the value of the critical luminosity @xmath88 erg / sec , which exceeds by more than an order of magnitude the minimum luminosity observed for sax j1808.43658 .",
    "however , an accurate calculation of @xmath89 requires detailed knowledge of the disk ",
    "magnetosphere interaction and the accretion flow pattern inside the magnetosphere .",
    "it is important to note that in order for this mechanism to be responsible for the spectral formation in sax j1808.43658 , self adjustment of the accretion funnel to maintain @xmath90 in a broad range of the accretion rates is required .",
    "comptonization on the bulk motion in the radiation dominated shock near the stellar surface in the equatorial area might also occur in the case of the `` classical '' x  ray bursters if the neutron star is smaller than the last marginally stable orbit ( @xcite ) .",
    "the power law spectra with a slope @xmath91 up to @xmath0 kev are indeed observed for some of the `` classical '' x  ray bursters at low luminosity , @xmath92 erg / sec ( fig.[spezoo ] ) .",
