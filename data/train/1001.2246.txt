    "in a previous paper ( * ? ? ? * hereafter k07 ) we presented measurements of the @xmath2 sky brightness at cerro tololo inter - american observatory , obtained with the ctio 0.9-m , 1.3-m , and 1.5-m telescopes and ccd detectors .",
    "as a sanity check we also obtained @xmath1- and @xmath0-band data with a 15-cm reflector and single channel photometer previously used by @xcite for an 11-year series of sky brightness measurements obtained at the 2800-m level of mauna kea .",
    "we found that at a zenith angle of @xmath380 deg we could measure the effect of artificial lights in la serena some 55 km away .",
    "the excess @xmath0-band light amounted to an enhancement of 44 to 72 percent above the model of @xcite .",
    "the december 2006 single channel @xmath1- and @xmath0-band measuremens are included in the analysis of the present paper .",
    "in december of 2008 we obtained more data with the single channel system of @xcite .",
    "our purpose was twofold : 1 ) to confirm the functional form of the basic model of garstang by taking data at the full range of zenith angles ; and 2 ) to determine a baseline level of light pollution measurable from cerro tololo .",
    "as la serena and coquimbo s population continues to grow , we can use these measurements to determine the effectiveness of the lighting control measures in place .",
    "our more and more antiquated , but still functional , photometric system consists of a 15-cm f/5.9 newtonian reflector and a very light photometer whose light sensitive element is an uncooled rca 931a photomultiplier ( pm ) tube @xmath4 effectively the same as a 1p21 tube .",
    "the @xmath0-band filter is a 2 mm thick piece of schott gg495 glass , which has a short wavelength cut on at about 4800  . at 5500 ",
    "it reaches a maximum transmission of 91 percent , which it retains to red end of the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the _ effective _ @xmath0-band filter transmission results from the combination of this transmission curve and the quantum efficiency ( qe ) of the pm tube , which falls to near zero at 7000  ( * ? ?",
    "the @xmath1-band filter is composed of a 2 mm thick piece of schott gg385 glass and a 1 mm thick piece of schott bg-12 glass .",
    "together they give a filter transmission which cuts on at 3600  , has peak transmission at 4000  , diminishes to zero shortly after 5000  , but then has a @xmath3 15 percent red leak starting at 7000  . given the near zero qe of the tube at the red end , the red leak would have no significant effect on the @xmath1-band measurements .    from 28 to 30 december 2008 ut our typical observing strategy",
    "was as follows : 1 ) start and end the night with measurements of standard stars chosen from the _ bright star catalogue _",
    "@xcite so that the photometric zeropoints are interpolated and never extrapolated ; 2 ) measure the background sky near the zenith , then very low in the sky , then at an intermediate zenith angle ; 3 ) measure a standard star every 40 minutes or so .",
    "our principal standard stars were bs 1179 and @xmath5 cae , with @xmath6 for observed less often .",
    "the first two stars could be observed on the same gain setting used for the sky brightness measures .",
    "this eliminates one source of potential systematic error .",
    "the output of the pm tube is amplified by a factor up to 10@xmath7 with an analog amplifier .",
    "the output is displayed real - time on a milliammeter and recorded with a hewlett packard strip chart recorder .    to determine the photometric zeropoints each night we assumed mean extinction coefficients of @xmath8 mag / airmass and @xmath9 = 0.274 mag / airmass , based on several years of ccd photometry at ctio . since our standards",
    "were observed between 1.0 and 1.1 airmasses , the adopted extinction values hardly mattered , but on any given night the derived sky brightness values are systematically in error by the difference of the true extinctions and the assumed values . of greater consequence",
    "is the drift of the zeropoints with time .",
    "we found that the drift was linear and amounted to a maximum of 0.03 mag / hour .",
    "the sky brightness measures presented here take into account these linear drifts .",
    "it should be noted that extinction corrections are not made to sky brightness measures , only to measures of standard stars .",
    "once we determine the equivalent @xmath1- and @xmath0-band magnitudes of the sky in our 6.522 square arc minute beam , we obtain the number of magnitudes per square arc second by adding 10.927 to the single - beam magnitudes .",
    "this additive factor is just 2.5 log@xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the beam size in square arc seconds .",
    "almost all of our high zenith angle measurements made in december 2006 and december 2008 were taken over la serena . on nights",
    "when there is no marine cloud layer , the city is clearly visible down below . in fig .",
    "[ la_serena ] we show a photo of this situation , obtained by one of us ( mgs ) .",
    "the sky - brightness data are found in table [ data ] .",
    "for the @xmath0-band we also give the flux in nanolamberts , using eq .",
    "3 of k07 or its equivalent ( * ? ? ?",
    "fluxes in nanolamberts are technically only relevant for the @xmath0-band , as it approximates the response of the human eye .",
    "we can convert the @xmath1-band sky brightness in mag / sec@xmath12 to the flux @xmath13 in photons / cm@xmath12/sec / steradian by using the inverse of eq .",
    "39 of @xcite , namely :    @xmath15 \\ ; .\\ ] ]    the observed flux of the sky near the zenith can effectively be corrected to the zenith by dividing it by the secant of the zenith angle .",
    "this is basically the same as eq .",
    "19 of @xcite :    @xmath16    = 0 mm    where @xmath17 is the zenith angle in radians .",
    "the mean sky brightness at the zenith in december 2008 was @xmath0 = 21.958 mag / sec@xmath12 .",
    "an individual @xmath0-band measurement at that flux level was accurate to @xmath18 0.060 mag / sec@xmath12 .",
    "this is based on 17 observations within 27 degrees of the zenith and corrected to the zenith using the formula of @xcite given above .",
    "the mean zenith @xmath0-band flux was 56.24 nl , with a 1-@xmath19 scatter of @xmath18 3.11 nl ( 5.5 percent ) .",
    "the mean @xmath1-band zenith sky brightness was 22.826 mag / sec@xmath12 .",
    "an individual @xmath1-band measurement at that flux level was accurate to @xmath18 0.10 mag / sec@xmath12 .",
    "these mean values are amongst the faintest levels we have ever measured , indicating that the solar minimum was still in effect in december 2008 .",
    "the individual @xmath0-band data points from december 2006 and december 2008 are shown in fig .",
    "[ vband ] . we have included the locus of @xcite derived for mt .",
    "graham , offset by + 3.0 nl , and the locus of @xcite for junipero serra ( california ) , similarly offset .",
    "since we did not correct our measurements for the presence of faint stars in the beam , some offset is understandable .",
    "garstang s improved 1991 model includes the addition of an ozone layer , a more accurate representation of the atmospheric molecular density variation as a function of height , a better mathematical representation of the scattering angular function of aerosols , and a thin layer of dust of arbitrary optical thickness and height above sea level .",
    "these modifications lead to a reduction of the predicted brightness of the night sky .",
    "the _ ratio _ of our @xmath0-band data to the slightly offset locus of @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ v_ratio ] .",
    "this shows that _ except _ at high zenith angle we do not measure any significant enhancement of the @xmath0-band sky brightness at ctio , even when we can clearly see la serena down below . for comparison the reader",
    "is directed to the interesting article by @xcite , which includes pictorial and graphical data along with modeling based on the @xcite model and an approximate correction for double scattering .",
    "our @xmath1-band data , converted to photons / cm@xmath12/sec / steradian , are shown in fig .",
    "[ bband ] . unlike our @xmath0-band data",
    ", there is no strong enhancement of the @xmath1-band light at high zenith angle when the lights of la serena / coquimbo are visible to the naked eye .",
    "this may be because the artificial lights presently in operation do not put out much light in the @xmath1-band .",
    "spectra of the scattered light should be obtained to check this .",
    "there is one curious `` anomaly '' in fig .",
    "[ vband ] .",
    "our final high zenith angle measurements on 30 december 2008 were obtained over the town of andacollo @xmath4 a much more southerly azimuth than la serena . though andacollo was clearly visible ( i.e. not covered by cloud ) , we measured no enhancement of the @xmath0-band flux in this direction compared to the model of @xcite .",
    "we surmise that this is due to the smaller population in andacollo and a smaller amount of airborne dust there . a combination of dust and light emitted above the horizontal",
    "gives us enhanced light levels over la serena and coquimbo when they are visible at cerro tololo .    as the population of la serena and coquimbo continues to grow",
    ", the observations presented here may serve as a reference .",
    "if the lighting ordinances in place are effective , we may see only minimally increased light pollution at ctio .",
