    "the orbital magnetic moments of transition - metal bulk magnets are largely quenched  @xcite , while transition - metal surfaces have extremely large orbital moments  @xcite .",
    "understanding the nature of the orbital moment is a problem of fundamental interest , and has over the years attracted much experimental attention through techniques such as xmcd  @xcite and ferromagnetic resonance  @xcite .",
    "the orbital moment is important for several reasons .",
    "first , it contributes to the total magnetic moment of a system , and second it is together with the spin magnetic moment a measure of the extent of spin - orbit coupling in general and magnetic anisotropy in particular  @xcite .",
    "the latter property is also known to couple to the anisotropy of the orbital moment  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "a detailed knowledge of orbital magnetism is crucial in designing new materials with desired hardness and saturation moments .",
    "most interestingly , recent xmcd experiments  @xcite on transition - metal clusters showed huge orbital moments in comparison with their bulk counterparts .",
    "hence these systems may possess a large magnetic anisotropy energy , which makes them potentially interesting for several technological applications . in this letter",
    "we investigate this possibility by means of several computational approaches .",
    "since the orbital magnetic moments of transition - metal clusters lie between those of the quenched values of the bulk systems and the large values of the isolated atoms , clusters provide a unique opportunity for studying the mechanisms that affect the orbital magnetic moments systematically .",
    "unfortunately , there is up to now no theory available that can reproduce the experimentally observed large orbital moments for the transition - metal clusters .",
    "we formulate here , using several computational methods , a theory of orbital and spin magnetism for these clusters .",
    "in particular , we take co clusters as a test case , because co atoms possess the largest orbital moments among the transition - metals in all their forms , as clusters  @xcite , surfaces  @xcite and bulk  @xcite .    previous theoretical studies on the magnetic structure of transition - metal clusters  @xcite focus primarily on the spin moment , due to the difficulties in estimating the orbital moment .",
    "the only theoretical study that addresses the orbital magnetic moment of pure clusters is focused on co@xmath0 , which is technically more treatable . in ref .   it is shown that the calculated spin moment in general is in reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "although the calculated spin and orbital magnetic moments of co@xmath1 clusters capped with pt  @xcite are available , there are no experimental data to compare with these calculations .",
    "the latter are also performed within gga , which is in the present work shown to be inadequate for these systems , e.g. by severely underestimating the orbital magnetic moments with respect to experiment  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is expected that also the previous study on the orbital magnetism of pt capped co@xmath1 clusters suffers from the inadequacy of gga functionals .",
    "the problem to face when calculating the orbital moment from conventional density functionals is the absence of hund s second rule , which is the primary reason for the orbital moment and is driven by intra - shell electrostatic interaction .",
    "the crystal field effect competes against this interaction , and results in a quenching of the orbital magnetism .",
    "it will be shown here that for complex systems like clusters , a high level theory is required to properly describe the subtle competition among these effects .",
    "more precisely , it will be shown that plain density - functional theory ( dft )  @xcite in its conventional lda / gga  @xcite or hybrid  @xcite forms severely underestimates the orbital moment of co clusters .",
    "also an approximate consideration of hund s second rule within extensions of plain dft like the orbital polarization correction  @xcite or the lda@xmath2 approach  @xcite results in a severe underestimation . among the theories explored in this study ,",
    "the only one that is consistent with the measured orbital moments is the combination of dft and dynamical mean - field theory ( usually addressed as lda+dmft  @xcite ) , which treats onsite correlations and thus hund s second rule exactly .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of dynamical correlations on orbital magnetism of magnetic transition - metal clusters as well as the fact that dmft can give reasonable results for clusters too .    for co impurities in gold",
    "it has already been demonstrated that lda+dmft is required to produce the large orbital moments observed in experiments  @xcite . in this study , the authors used the spin - polarized t - matrix fluctuation exchange solver , because the correlation effects are not very strong and can be treated perturbatively . as a matter of fact , we did try to use this solver for the presently studied systems but found that it was inappropriate to describe the formation of orbital moments which are close to their atomic values .",
    "therefore , we exploited the exact diagonalization routine for the impurity part of dmft .",
    "the focus of this work is on the calculation of the spin and orbital moments of pure co clusters . for this purpose",
    "several codes based on density - functional theory ( dft ) , and extensions , have been used .",
    "the extensions are used to incorporate step by step a more sophisticated treatment of the onsite coulomb repulsion .",
    "namely it is this onsite coulomb interaction that leads to the formation of local spin and orbital moments , which in atoms is summarized by the first and second hund s rules . on the other hand",
    "the crystal field effects compete against this mechanism quenching both moments .",
    "a proper theory should take these two competing effects accurately into account , but at the moment such a theory exists only for pure atoms or dimers at most .",
    "therefore we have explored several suitable techniques for our purposes .",
    "the first method considered here is plain kohn - sham dft , with an exchange - correlation functional in the local density approximation ( lda ) as formulated by perdew and wang ( pw )  @xcite , in the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) as formulated by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite and in the b3lyp hybrid approximation  @xcite . in all these approximations",
    "the second hund s rule is completely neglected , and orbital moments are induced by the spin moment through the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "further , lda and gga are derived in the limit of a ( nearly ) uniform electron gas , while the hybrid functional treats the electron exchange of the inhomogeneous system partially exactly .",
    "therefore , dft in these forms only describes onsite coulomb effects in a very rough approximation as far as orbital magnetism is concerned .",
    "the situation improves when an explicit onsite coulomb repulsion term is considered , leading to a generalized hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "the idea behind this is to combine dft and the hubbard model . here , we exploit the fact that dft works well for the ( weakly correlated ) delocalized electrons in the system , while the onsite coulomb repulsion term is crucial for the description of ( strongly correlated ) localized electrons as known from studies of the hubbard model .",
    "there are basically two methods available to approximately solve this generalized hubbard model .",
    "the first is the static mean field approximation , i.e. the lda+u method  @xcite .",
    "this should describe to a certain extent the effects due to the second hund s rule , although at the price of a forced broken symmetry , which is not a problem in the present case  @xcite .",
    "the second approach to this problem is based on the dynamical mean - field approximation  @xcite , which leads to the lda+dmft approach  @xcite .",
    "the lda+dmft approach becomes exact in the atomic limit or equivalently when hybridization effects can be neglected , in the non - interacting limit , and in the limit of an infinite number of nearest neighbors . within this respect",
    "the regime of small clusters is rather far from the limit of infinite neighbors , although it has been shown that in practical terms this limit is reached very fast , even for a small number of nearest neighbors  @xcite . in order to evaluate the influence of hybridization effects we perform two types of lda+dmft calculations .",
    "the first is a simplified version of the lda+dmft method in the limit of zero hybridization , i.e. hubbard - i approximation  @xcite .",
    "the second is a more accurate version , where the hybridization is considered within the exact diagonalization routine . due to the inclusion of the onsite coulomb interaction term , the hubbard @xmath3 and hund exchange @xmath4 parameters of co clusters",
    "are required as an input for the lda+u and lda+dmft calculations .",
    "it is not clear from the beginning what the hubbard @xmath3 value in the cluster regime is but it is reasonable to assume that it is intermediate between the bulk value of about 3  ev and the atomic value of about 14  ev  @xcite . to obtain the hubbard @xmath3 and hund exchange @xmath4 of co clusters we performed calculations using the constrained random phase approximation ( crpa )  @xcite .",
    "the results are reported and discussed below .    in the lda+u calculations",
    "there is a great risk to obtain a solution that corresponds to a local minimum instead of the global one . to avoid this problem",
    "we have used the method of ref .  , which consists in starting from a converged dft calculation and then increasing @xmath3 and @xmath4 step - by - step .",
    "for completeness this type of calculation is compared with a lda+u calculation starting from a converged dft calculation , but without a step wise increase of the hubbard @xmath3 and hund exchange @xmath4 value .",
    "finally , most codes evaluate the orbital moments only within certain spheres around the atomic sites  @xcite .",
    "however , here we have also evaluated the contribution to the orbital moment given by the interstitial region in between these spheres via the modern theory of orbital polarization  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the plethora of these calculations could not be made by means of a single code .",
    "therefore , different codes have been used for different purposes .",
    "calculations based on lsda and gga were made using _",
    "@xcite , _ vasp _  @xcite and _ quantum espresso _  @xcite ( with orbital moment obtained from modern theory of orbital polarization  @xcite ) .",
    "the crpa calculations of hubbard @xmath3 and hund exchange @xmath4 were made using _ fleur _  @xcite and _ spex",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the lsda+u calculations were made with _",
    "vasp _ , whereas the lsda+dmft calculations were made with _",
    "rspt_. all the computational details are contained in the appendix .      the hubbard @xmath3 and hund exchange @xmath4 parameters are required as an input for lda+u and lda+dmft calculations .",
    "the crpa method was used to calculate these parameters , which are reported in table  [ hubujrpa ] for co@xmath5 to co@xmath6 .",
    "we find that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are slightly different for inequivalent atomic sites in a given cluster .",
    "therefore , the values shown in table  [ hubujrpa ] are average values .",
    ".the hubbard @xmath3 and hund exchange @xmath4 parameters in ev obtained from crpa calculations for co@xmath5 to co@xmath6 clusters .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tabdmft ] the spin and orbital moments obtained within the more accurate execution of the lda+dmft method are shown . from this table",
    "it is observed that the effect of the hybridization on the spin and orbital moments is indeed small for co@xmath7 and co@xmath8 , while it is large for co@xmath0",
    ". this large influence on the orbital moment for co@xmath0 can be traced back to the energy difference between the many body eigenstates obtained in the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "namely , for co@xmath0 the energy difference between the ground state and the first two higher lying states is at least an order of magnitude smaller than what is observed for co@xmath7 and co@xmath8 . since for clusters from co@xmath9 to co@xmath10 this energy difference is of the same order of what is found for co@xmath7 and co@xmath8 , hybridization effects should be small also for these clusters .",
    "this discussion leads us to conclude that our calculated value of the orbital moment for clusters from co@xmath0 to co@xmath11 is indeed approximately 0.7  @xmath12/atom , which is exactly what is expected from extrapolations from experimental data .",
    "furthermore , one can conclude that lda+dmft already in its most simplified form ( the hubbard - i approximation ) provides very accurate orbital moments except for co@xmath0 , i.e. when hybridization effects are expected to be large . in this case , and in general for all systems with large hybridization effects , the more accurate exact diagonalization version of the lda+dmft method should be employed .    from the discussion above it is clear that the calculated orbital moment for co@xmath13 and co@xmath10 within the approximation is in good agreement with experiment .",
    "then , from a comparison between lda+dmft calculations with and without hybridization effects included , we could show that the orbital moment for co@xmath0 to co@xmath11 is also approximately 0.7  @xmath12/atom .",
    "it is important to stress that this in principle only holds for neutral clusters .",
    "future ( xmcd ) experiments should show whether this also holds for charged clusters .",
    "very recently xmcd experiments have been performed on co@xmath14 , for which the ground state is found to be of @xmath15 and @xmath16 type  @xcite .",
    "this result is obtained from a discussion , which is entirely based on the ratio of the spin and orbital moment . in this way difficulties due to the unknown number of d - holes , ion temperatue and degree of circular polarization due to the incident photon beam",
    "are circumvented .",
    "however , in this work also an estimation of the orbital and spin moment is made , i.e. respectively 0.29  @xmath12/atom and 1.18  @xmath12/atom .",
    "both orbital and spin moment are thus found to be about a factor 2 smaller than what we obtain from our best lda+dmft calculations ( table  [ tabdmft ] ) .",
    "here we should note that the ratio of orbital and spin moment found by us , i.e. 0.24 , is exactly the same as what was observed experimentally .",
    "further , it is difficult to reconcile an orbital and spin moment of 0.29  @xmath12/atom and 1.18  @xmath12/atom for a ground state of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , for completeness we also performed a lda+dmft calculation with hybridization effects included for co@xmath17 ( with the same inter atomic distance as used for co@xmath0 ) .",
    "we find an orbital moment of 0.69  @xmath12/atom , which again shows the very small influence of the charge on the orbital moment .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of orbital and spin moment is found to be 0.20 , which is within their error bars , i.e. 0.24@xmath180.04 .",
    "further , it is clear that a change of the hubbard @xmath3 from 8 to 9  ev has little influence on the spin and orbital moments of co@xmath5 ( table  [ tabdmft ] ) .",
    "the same holds for an increase of the interatomic distance from 2.2 to 2.4   .",
    "thus , although dmft is supposed to work better for increasing cluster size due to the increasing number of nearest neighbors , the orbital moment of co@xmath0 is already in agreement with our expectation of 0.7  @xmath12/atom .",
    "however , note that according to an exact ( many body ) consideration , the sum of the spin and orbital angular moment along the dimer axis should be integer or half integer .",
    "from an inspection of table  [ tabdmft ] it is clear that this is not the case .",
    "this could be due to an overestimation of the spin , since it is subtantially larger than the values obtained by gga and lda+u ( see table  [ vaspso1 ] ) .",
    "further , it is well known that approximate methods like gga , lda+u and lda+dmft can violate rigorous symmetry considerations .",

    "[ co234 ] . from table  [ tabdmft ] it can be seen that for the in - plane spin axis the orbital moment is 0.1  @xmath12/atom larger than for the out of plane spin axis . for both spin axes",
    "the orbital moment is in good agreement with the roughly expected orbital moment of 0.7  @xmath12/atom .",
    "the spin moment is a bit larger than obtained from gga and lda+u in table  [ vaspso1 ] .    for co@xmath20 two different spin axes in the plane of the rhombus",
    "are considered ( fig .",
    "[ co234 ] ) .",
    "as can be observed from table  [ tabdmft ] , the orbital moment is very similar for both spin axes .",
    "further , both orbital moments are in good agreement with the 0.7  @xmath12/atom orbital moment , which is roughly expected .",
    "the spin moment is very similar to that obtained for gga and lda+u in table  [ vaspso1 ] .    in order to visualize the difference in orbital moment between the lda , lda+u and lda+dmft ( with hybridization effects included ) methods , we took the planar structure of co@xmath20 as a typical example to plot the projected 3@xmath19 density of states for ( see fig .",
    "[ dos ] ) . from this figure",
    "it can be observed that the density of states changes drastically between the methods .",
    "furthermore , by a detailed inspection one may observe that the difference between the @xmath22 and @xmath23 , as wel as @xmath24 and @xmath25 projected density of states increases when going from lda to lda+u and from lda+u to lda+dmft . to see how this asymmetry carries over to the orbital magnetism",

    "it is clear where and how the difference in orbital moment between the different methods occurs .",

    "the dashed lines correspond to the integrals of these differences .",
    ", width=340 ]    finally , we would like to come back to table  [ tabhia ]",
    ". it would be interesting to see for what cluster sizes the orbital moment reaches the ( hcp ) bulk value of 0.13  @xmath12/atom  @xcite .",
    "we speculate that a central atom in a cluster with nearest and next - nearest neighboring atoms will have a bulk like orbital moment .",
    "this speculation is based on the observation that for surfaces in general the third layer already behaves bulk like  @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that in order to obtain a bulk like total orbital moment the major part of atoms in a cluster should have nearest and next - nearest neighboring atoms .",
    "the size and direction of spin and orbital moments are determined by several interactions of a material , e.g. kinematic effects , crystal field interaction and on - site coulomb repulsion between electrons .",
    "all this can amount to a complex dynamical interaction which critically influences all properties , in particular magnetism .",
    "the present investigation is mainly focused on spin and orbital magnetism of clusters , where we find that the orbital magnetism behaves differently from the large value of the atomic limit as well as the reduced value of bulk and thin films .",
    "we here focus on clusters since they are excellent model systems that allow for an investigation where different interactions can have different relative importance , and hence allow for a means to elucidate the importance of different contributions .",
    "we consider several levels of theory to undertake this investigation , with increasing level of accuracy , e.g. gga , orbital polarization correction , lda+u and hybrid functionals .",
    "we found that none of these approximations resulted in calculated orbital moments that are in agreement with experiments .",
    "only when one considers a description based on multiple slater determinants , as in the lda+dmft method , the theory predicts the orbital moments is in accordance with experiment .",
    "thus , for a proper treatment of the orbital moment it is absolutely crucial to take the onsite coulomb correlations accurately into account in a dynamical fashion .",
    "furthermore , from comparing lda+dmft calculations with and without hybridization effects , we can conclude that the static crystal field potential is the dominant quenching mechanism for the orbital moment except for co@xmath0 , where hybridization effects are also very important . since lda+dmft becomes exact in the limit of negligible hybridization",
    ", it is not surprising that it already works for small cluster sizes , co@xmath7 to co@xmath10 .",
    "our findings in this work are relevant not only for co clusters , but have bearing also for isolated co atoms on substrates , e.g. as reported in refs .   or as impurities  @xcite .",
    "these studies can be summarized as all showing large orbital moments ( in the range of @xmath29 0.8 to @xmath29 1.5 @xmath30/atom ) in experiment , which was not reproduced by first principles theory ( on gga or lda level ) . in these works , as well as in previous investigations ,  @xcite the effects of reduced symmetry ,",
    "correlation effects associated with narrow bands , and spin - orbit effects of ligand orbitals were discussed . however , a clear understanding of which effect dominates for specific systems was not obtained .",
    "the present investigation clearly points to the importance of electron correlation as a general cause of large orbital magnetism of narrow band systems .",

    "<S> recent experiments on isolated co clusters have shown huge orbital magnetic moments in comparison with their bulk and surface counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> these clusters hence provide the unique possibility to study the evolution of the orbital magnetic moment with respect to the cluster size and how competing interactions contribute to the quenching of orbital magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate here different theoretical methods to calculate the spin and orbital moments of co clusters , and assess the performances of the methods in comparison with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that density functional theory in conventional local density or generalized gradient approximations , or even with a hybrid functional , severely underestimates the orbital moment . </S>",
    "<S> as natural extensions / corrections we considered the orbital polarization correction , the lda+u approximation as well as the lda+dmft method . </S>",
    "<S> our theory shows that of the considered methods , only the lda+dmft method provides orbital moments in agreement with experiment , thus emphasizing the importance of dynamic correlations effects for determining fundamental magnetic properties of magnets in the nano - size regime . </S>"
