    "`` hybrid '' models can populate a broad region of the inflationary parameter space , the presence of a dynamical fixed point means that there is a simple subclass of hybrid models that live in a narrow band of parameter space along a line with @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "we will see below that while the wmap3 data do not rule out the entire region which we label here as `` hybrid , '' the simplest hybrid models evolving near the dynamical fixed point are clearly disfavored by the data .",
    "an example of a model which falls into the``hybrid '' region of the @xmath4@xmath3 plane away from the dynamical fixed point is a potential with a negative power of the scalar field , @xmath83 $ ] , used in intermediate inflation @xcite and dynamical supersymmetric inflation @xcite .",

    "the four classes of inflation models , categorized by the relationship between the slow - roll parameters as @xmath57 ( large field ) , @xmath100 ( small field , linear ) , and @xmath76 ( hybrid ) , cover the entire @xmath4@xmath3 plane and are in that sense complete at first order in the slow roll parameters .",
    "however , this feature is lost going beyond first order : models can evolve from one region to another .",
    "this feature is manifest when changing the parameter @xmath23 , and is particularly relevant for those models for which the running of the observables with the scale is sizable @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to realize that the lowest - order correspondence between the slow - roll parameters and the class of models does not always survive to higher order in slow roll .",

    "the method we adopt is based on the publicly available markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) package ` cosmomc ` @xcite .",
    "we sample the following eight - dimensional set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on them : the physical baryon and cdm densities , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath110 , the scalar spectral index , its running and the overall normalization of the spectrum , @xmath3 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 at @xmath113 mpc@xmath114 , the tensor contribution @xmath4 , and , finally , the optical depth to reionization , @xmath115 .",
