    "convergence results of this kind are particularly well documented in the case where @xmath10 is a random walk [ see the monograph by @xcite ] , and have more recently been extended to cover generating mechanisms that allow the increments of @xmath10 to exhibit significant temporal dependence [ @xcite ] .",
    "these more general theorems concerning ( [ eq : fidiintro ] ) have , in turn , played a fundamental role in the study of nonparametric estimation and testing in the setting of nonlinear cointegrating models .",
    "the simplest of these models takes the form @xmath11 where @xmath10 is as above , @xmath12 is a weakly dependent error process , and @xmath13 is an unknown function , assumed to possess a certain degree of smoothness ( or be otherwise approximable ) . in a series of recent papers , ( [ eq : fidiintro ] ) has facilitated the development of a pointwise asymptotic distribution theory for kernel regression estimators of @xmath13 under very general conditions : see especially @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "while we consider this approach to the problem to be equally important , our results touch upon it only a little , since we work with a class of regressor processes that are typically ( excepting the random walk case ) non - markov . ]",
    "however , there are definite limits to the range of problems that can be successfully addressed with the aid of ( [ eq : fidiintro ] ) . in particular , since it concerns only the finite - dimensional convergence of @xmath14 , ( [ eq : fidiintro ] ) is suited only to studying the _ local _ behavior of a nonparametric estimator : that is , its behavior in the vicinity of a fixed spatial point . for the purpose of obtaining uniform rates of convergence for kernel regression estimators on `` wide '' domains  that is , on domains having a width of the _ same _ order as the range of @xmath15it is manifestly inadequate .",
    "[ see @xcite , for a detailed account .",
    "] the situation is even worse with regard to sieve nonparametric estimation in this setting  which initially motivated the author s research on this problem  since in this case the development of even a _ pointwise _ asymptotic distribution theory requires a prior result on the _ uniform _ consistency of the estimator , over the entire domain on which estimation is to be performed .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is thus to provide conditions under which the finite - dimensional convergence in ( [ eq : fidiintro ] ) can be strengthened to the weak convergence @xmath16 where @xmath17 is regarded as a process indexed by @xmath18 , and @xmath19 may be random .",
    "results of this kind are available in the existing literature , but only in the random walk case , which requires that the increments of @xmath10 be independent , and @xmath9 to be an @xmath20-stable lvy motion [ see @xcite ( @xcite ) ; @xcite ; and @xcite , chapter  v ] .",
    "in contrast , we allow the increments of @xmath10 to be serially correlated , such that the associated limiting process @xmath9 may be a linear fractional stable motion , which subsumes the @xmath20-stable lvy motion and fractional brownian motion as special cases .",
    "further , we permit the bandwidth sequence @xmath19 to be a _ random _",
    "process , subject only to certain weak asymptotic growth conditions : this is of considerable utility in statistical applications , where the assumption that @xmath19 is a `` given '' deterministic sequence seems quite unrealistic .",
