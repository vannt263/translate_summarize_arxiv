    "a zeeman slower is a special magnet , which allows continuous laser cooling of thermal atomic beams with just a single laser beam of fixed frequency .",
    "the purpose of this magnet is to compensate the doppler frequency shift of the cooling atomic transition by the spatially - dependent zeeman frequency shift , which provides a continuous resonant interaction between the cooling laser light and the decelerated atoms for all atomic velocities within the capture range of the slower . as the most intense sources of cold atoms , ovens combined with zeeman slowers are widely used in different atomic physics experiments , including producing bose einstein condensates @xcite and optical atomic clocks @xcite , which demand a large number of cold atoms .",
    "a standard longitudinal zeeman slower @xcite uses a special current - carrying coil to create a proper spatial distribution of the magnetic field along its axis .    in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "zeeman slowers based on arrays of permanent magnetic dipoles ( md ) were proposed .",
    "the first of these spin - flip transverse zeeman slower for sr atoms @xcite , based on compact neodymium permanent magnets , was recently implemented in the npl sr optical clock and has already demonstrated its efficiency , convenience and reliability . in spite of the simplicity of the transverse md - zeeman slowers ( where the magnetic field is directed transversely to the direction of the atomic and cooling laser beams ) such slowers have some limitations .",
    "first , the transverse zeeman slower demands twice as much laser power , compared to standard longitudinal slowers . for linear polarization of the cooling light ,",
    "only one of its two circular - polarization components of different helicity is in resonance with the corresponding zeeman shifted transition of the slowed atoms .",
    "second , the spin - flip ( the slower , in which the magnetic field is changing its sign ) transverse zeeman slower is working only for atoms without ( or with small ) zeeman splittings of the ground internal state , like sr or yb , for example . for atoms with essential splitting of the ground state , like li ,",
    "na , rb , cs , cr the linear polarization of the cooling light of the transverse zeeman slower prevents it from optically pumping atoms to the correct ( slowed ) magnetic substate in the region where the the magnetic field turns to zero , which leads to loss of the decelerated atoms at that region .",
    "this last fact has been confirmed by the recent tests of the transverse md - zeeman slower for li and cr atoms @xcite .",
    "recently a longitudinal zeeman slower for rb atoms , based on an 8-bars halbach configuration of permanent magnets , has been successfully demonstrated @xcite .",
    "this paper considers longitudinal spin - flip zeeman slowers , which are using just two or four rows of standard cylindrical neodymium magnets , configured according to the original general proposal @xcite .",
    "the simplest of these sr longitudinal slowers has already been successfully tested on the npl optical clock setup @xcite .    in the first chapter of this paper ,",
    "a short revision of the general theory of zeeman slowers is given .",
    "the second chapter describes a general approach to the design of longitudinal md - zeeman slowers based on arrays of magnetic dipoles ( md ) as well as the two designs of slower for sr atoms .",
    "the fourth chapter gives an example of a design of a spin - flip longitudinal slower for rb atoms .",
    "finally , in the conclusion the main results are summarized .",
    "a zeeman slower decelerates atoms by resonant scattering of photons from a counterpropagating laser beam .",
    "it is supposed that the monochromatic laser light of frequency @xmath0 resonantly interacts with some isolated and closed atomic transition of frequency @xmath1 , such that the corresponding interaction can be described with a two - level model of an atom .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that the atom is placed in the magnetic field of a zeeman magnet , which is characterized by a spatially dependent amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "we assume also that this magnetic field leads to a zeeman shift of the frequency of the atomic transition of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the magnetic moment for the atomic transition .",
    "the average spontaneous light pressure force on the atoms in the direction of propagation of the laser beam , given by @xmath5 ^ 2/\\gamma^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the wave vector of light , @xmath7 is the local on - resonance saturation parameter of the atomic transition , @xmath8 is the linewidth of the transition , @xmath9 is the laser frequency detuning and @xmath10 is the velocity of the atom .",
    "the velocity dependence of the force is determined by the effective frequency detuning @xmath11 , which includes the doppler shift @xmath12 of the atomic frequency .",
    "the dependence of the relative magnitude of the force on the effective frequency detuning @xmath13 , for @xmath14 , is shown in fig.1 .",
    "( see the text ) , on the relative effective frequency detuning of the cooing light @xmath15 .",
    "the dashed line gives the same dependence of the derivative of the force . ]    the maximum value of the local deceleration , provided by the force , is achieved at exact resonance , @xmath16 , and is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the atom .",
    "although the maximum deceleration can be used to estimate the shortest possible length of a zeeman slower , this can not be realized in practice . at exact resonance an equilibrium between the inertial force of the decelerated atoms and the light force is unstable and any slight increase of the atomic velocity due to imperfection of the magnetic field distribution or spontaneous heating of atoms will lead to a decrease of the decelerating force and subsequent loss of atoms from the deceleration process . in practice",
    "the deceleration of atoms is realized at a fraction of the maximum deceleration @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "note that the coefficient @xmath21 in our case corresponds to the ratio between the reduced local acceleration and the maximum possible acceleration at the same location , which is a function of the local saturation parameter @xmath7 . in a standard treatment @xcite",
    "a similar coefficient @xmath22 appears , which relates the actual deceleration to the maximum possible deceleration at infinite intensity of laser light .",
    "the two coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 are related as @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the constant coefficient @xmath21 corresponds to a variable coefficient @xmath22 , the value of which depends on the local intensity of light .    when the local deceleration @xmath24 is less than @xmath25 , which corresponds to @xmath20 the decelerated atoms stay on the low - velocity wing of the lorentzian velocity profile of the light force ( 1 ) and undergo stable deceleration ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the corresponding frequency detuning of the cooling light from the optical transition of the decelerated atoms at the active part of a zeeman slower is determined by    @xmath26    in a general case when the saturation parameter @xmath7 changes due to convergence of the cooling laser beam and its absorption by decelerated atoms , the frequency detuning @xmath27 also essentially changes along the axis of the slower .",
    "the optimal offset of the equilibrium velocity @xmath28 from the resonant velocity is achieved at a point where the derivative of the force ( 1 ) reaches its maximum , because the damping of the relative motion of atoms around this point is maximal .",
    "it is easy to show that within our definition of the @xmath21 coefficient ( 3 ) this optimal cooling condition is achieved exactly at @xmath29 at each local intensity of light inside the slower .",
    "the damping coefficient of the force , which is maximal at @xmath29 , reaches its maximum at @xmath30 and slowly decreases with further increase of the intensity of the laser field .",
    "the calculation of the required spatial distribution of the magnetic field in a zeeman slower proceeds as follows .",
    "first , the actual velocity of the slowing atoms is calculated numerically according to the formula    @xmath31    with this approach it is easy to include the spatial variation of the saturation parameter @xmath7 due to convergence of the cooling laser beam and even due to absorption of its light by the decelerated atoms @xcite .",
    "based on the calculated slowing velocity @xmath32 , the corresponding distribution of the magnetic field can be derived from the equality @xmath33 as @xmath34    this equation accepts multiple solutions , which correspond to different constant offcet of the magnetic field and corresponding frequency detuning @xmath35 of the slowing light , where @xmath36 is the coordinate of the maximum of the magnetic field at the end of the slower . in this paper we are considering symmetric spin - flip zeeman slowers , in which the magnitudes of the magnetic field at both ends of the slowers are equal and of opposite sign .",
    "the field of a single magnetic dipole placed at the origin of a cartesian system of coordinates and oriented along the z - axis is described by the formulae @xmath37 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "b_y=\\frac{\\mu_0 m}{4 \\pi } \\left [ \\frac{3yz}{r^5 } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\",
    "b_z=\\frac{\\mu_0 m}{4 \\pi } \\left [ \\frac{2z^2-x^2-y^2}{r^5 } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the magnetic moment of the dipole .    in this paper the longitudinal zeeman slowers based on arrays of magnetic dipoles , oriented parallel to the @xmath40-axis of the slower , are considered .",
    "the spatial distribution of the magnetic field generated by an array of such dipoles is determined by summation of the corresponding field amplitudes , produced by each of the individual dipoles .",
    "an array of magnetic dipoles , oriented parallel to the z - axis and placed in the x0z - plane with coordinates of individual dipoles of @xmath41 , are generating the magnetic field with distribution of the @xmath42-component at the z - axis of    @xmath43.\\ ] ]    for a symmetric distribution of the magnetic dipoles around the @xmath40-axis , all other components of the magnetic field at this axis are equal to zero . for positions away from the @xmath40-axis ,",
    "the magnitudes of the transverse components of the field , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , can be computed in a similar way .",
    "component of the magnetic field along the @xmath40-axis , generated by two continuous line - like arrays of magnetic dipoles , oriented parallel to that axis and located at the same distance @xmath46 cm from it .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the short array , @xmath47 cm , and the dashed one to a long array of length @xmath48 cm . ]",
    "the solid line in fig.2 shows the spatial distribution of the @xmath49 component of the magnetic field along the @xmath40-axis for a line - like continuous array of magnetic dipoles covering a length @xmath47 cm with total magnetic moment @xmath50a@xmath51m@xmath52 , oriented parallel to this axis and placed at a distance of @xmath53 cm from it .",
    "the dashed curve in fig.2 shows the spatial distribution of the field at the @xmath40-axis generated by a @xmath54 cm long continuous line - like array of magnetic dipoles with total magnetic moment @xmath55a@xmath51m@xmath52 , which is located at the same distance of @xmath53 cm from the @xmath40-axis .",
    "it means , that the linear density of the magnetic moments of these two arrays is the same .",
    "one can see that , in spite of the much larger total magnetic moment of the longer array of dipoles , its field amplitude is smaller than the field amplitude of the short array of magnetic dipoles .",
    "moreover , for an infinitely long array of longitudinal magnetic dipoles , the amplitude of its outside field becomes equal to zero .",
    "it is easy to show that the @xmath42-component of the magnetic field of such an array is maximal when its length is @xmath56 , while its spatial distribution along the @xmath40-axis is broadened but still has a single maximum .        for laser cooling of sr atoms ,",
    "the @xmath57 transition with wavelength @xmath58 nm and natural linewidth @xmath59mhz is used .",
    "one of the simplest longitudinal spin - flip zeeman slowers for sr atoms , based on magnetic dipoles , is shown in fig.3 .",
    "it consists of four cylindrical neodymium magnets , placed symmetrically with respect to the @xmath40-axis of the slower in the x0z plane .",
    "the magnetic moments of the long and short magnets are directed parallel to the @xmath40-axis with opposite polarity .",
    "all the magnets have a diameter of @xmath60 mm .",
    "the base of the two long magnets is located at @xmath61 and @xmath62 mm and their length is equal to @xmath63 mm .",
    "the length of the short magnets is equal to @xmath64 mm , while there distances from the axis of the slower are @xmath65 mm .",
    "the gap between the magnets is equal to @xmath66 mm .",
    "therefore , the smaller end magnets are located closer to the axis of the slower , which provides a larger gradient of the magnetic field at the end of the slower .",
    "the total magnetic moment of each of the long magnets is @xmath67a@xmath51m@xmath52 , where @xmath68 is the volume of the magnet , @xmath69 t is the residual induction of a standard neodymium magnet and @xmath70h@xmath51m@xmath71 is the permeability of free space .",
    "the corresponding total magnetic moment of the short magnets is equal to @xmath72a@xmath51m@xmath52 .",
    "the central solid line in fig.4 shows the target spatial distribution of the magnetic field , which was calculated for @xmath73 , capture velocity @xmath74 m/s , final velocity @xmath75 m/s , slowing length of about @xmath76 cm , a saturation parameter of the cooling laser beam at the end of the slower of @xmath77 and a convergence angle of the laser beam , @xmath78 .",
    "the design frequency detuning of the cooling laser beam is @xmath79mhz .",
    "the slower is designed for @xmath73 to provide maximum deceleration of atoms , which minimises the length of the slower and decreases the transverse broadening of the atomic beam due to its heating by spontaneously scattered photons .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the operation of a zeeman slower at almost critical deceleration ( @xmath73 ) is possible only when its spetial distribution of the magnetic field is smooth enough , as it is in the md zeeman slowers considered here .",
    "the thin solid line shows the magnetic field distribution along the axis of the slower , which was calculated with a md model ( 8) , where each magnet was substituted with a row of point - like magnetic dipoles , separated from each other by a distance of 4 mm , with the same total magnetic moment as the modeled magnet .",
    "the lines are slightly shifted with respect to each other along the @xmath40-axis solely to see better the agreement between their slopes .",
    "the two dashed lines correspond to the spatial magnetic field distributions produced by each ( left and right ) half of the slower .",
    "one can see that the @xmath40-positions of maximum and minimum of the magnetic field are located nearly exactly where the centres of the magnets are .",
    "therefore , the slowing length of such a slower is shorter than the physical size of the slower and the magnets are not used efficiently .",
    "the design of a more efficient longitudinal zeeman slower is shown in fig.5 .",
    "this slower consists of four identical sections , each of which includes two stacks of magnets ( `` entrance '' and `` output '' magnets ) of opposite polarity , placed symmetrically with respect to the @xmath40-axis and located in @xmath80 and @xmath81 planes .",
    "each `` entrance '' magnet consists of 16 individual neodymium magnets with length of 8 mm , diameter of 20 mm and magnetic moment of @xmath82a@xmath51m@xmath52 .",
    "each `` output '' magnet contains 6 individual magnets .",
    "the exact distances of the centres of these magnets from the @xmath40-axis , which are changing nearly linearly with @xmath40-coordinate , are given in table1 .",
    "unfortunately , the problem of finding of the positions of individual magnetic dipoles of the slower , which is producing the target spatial distribution of the field of the slower at its axis , has no single solution .",
    "the exact fitting of the target field distribution at the ends of the slower is also impossible .",
    "our general procedure for finding the positions of the magnets consists of the following steps .",
    "first , a simple spin - flip slower with two long cylindrical magnets , placed parallel to the @xmath40-axis as in fig3 , is calculated to have its field distribution maximally close to the target field distribution .",
    "as a next step , the magnets are moved closer to the axis of the slower , in such a way that the corresponding distances of the magnets @xmath83 from the axis are linearly decreasing from the centre of the slower ( where the magnetic field crosses zero ) towards the outer ends of the slower . finally , the residual kinks in the spatial distribution of the magnetic field are eliminated by fine tuning of the positions of the group of the magnets in the vicinity of that kink .",
    "this slower was designed for @xmath84 , capture velocity @xmath85 m/s , final velocity @xmath75 m/s , saturation parameter at the end of the slower @xmath77 and diameter of the cooling laser beam at that location of 1.0 cm with a convergence angle of @xmath86rad .",
    "the design frequency detuning of the cooling laser beam is @xmath87mhz .",
    "the spatial distribution of the magnetic field of the slower , calculated with the md model , and the target field distribution are shown in fig6 .",
    "the slowing length is now @xmath88 cm , which is close to the physical length of the slower .",

    "rubidium is a popular and convenient element for laser cooling , which is used in multiple atomic physics experiments , including producing bec and laser - cooled atomic frequency standards .",
