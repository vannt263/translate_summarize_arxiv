    "we focus on providing a complete phenomenological description of both resonant and non - resonant technimeson production .",

    ". however , our methods are also applicable to future linear colliders at higher energies .",
    "we use the technicolor straw man model ( tcsm ) @xcite as a benchmark for assessing the experimental visibility of technipion production .",

    "the members of the doublet are assigned electric charges @xmath9  and @xmath10  respectively .",
    "this flavor and gauge structure gives rise to the same type of spectrum as two  flavor qcd : namely , an isotriplet and isosinglet of pseudoscalar , pseudo - goldstone modes , the @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and an isotriplet and isosinglet of vector modes , the @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "calculation of matrix elements involving the technihadron bound states at energies below the technicolor scale , @xmath16 , in the full non - abelian technicolor model requires use of low energy phenomenological models . in the recent past",
    ", two different types of descriptions have been widely used for fermion  antifermion annihilation to a technipion plus electroweak gauge boson . in these the initial  state fermions couple with standard weak couplings to the appropriate electroweak gauge bosons in the @xmath17channel .",
    "the descriptions differ in how they handle the weak gauge boson transition to the final state , and can be divided into    1 .",

    "our goal is to synthesize these approaches within the tcsm to eliminate the shortcomings of each .    in section  [ sec :",
    "approaches ] , we review the details of both the anomaly  mediated and dominated approaches to the tcsm and indicate the limitations of their individual descriptions of technimeson production at lepton colliders .",

    "since this scheme does not take into account the heavier technimeson bound states of the technifermions ( the states equivalent to the qcd @xmath43 and @xmath44 , among others ) , it can only provide a valid description of technicolor physics in kinematic regions well below the propagator poles of the lightest technivector meson @xcite .      to describe the kinematic regime near the technivector poles ,",
    "an alternative phenomenological approach is needed ; typically this takes the form of the dominance scheme introduced above . for the tcsm",
    ", a framework has been developed by lane @xcite .",
    "conceptually , the collider experiments generate electroweak gauge bosons via the direct couplings of standard model particles to the electroweak gauge fields .",
    "the electroweak gauge bosons then convert into technivector mesons through mixing terms in the vector propagator matrix ( for illustration , we display the inverse of the neutral propagator matrix here ) @xmath45 where the masses , @xmath46 include @xmath17dependent width effects .",

    ", it did not properly include contributions that are far below the poles @xcite .",
    "however , at an   collider such as lep ( or a future linear collider ) , the machine s operating energy @xmath5 may be well away from the resonance . for those cases , it is necessary to include off  resonance contributions . at the very least ,",
    "this may allow more stringent limits on technihadron masses and couplings to be derived from searches in @xmath53 colliders .",
    "the coupling of the initial state electrons to the gauge boson is unchanged from the standard model .",

    "a more detailed discussion of this and other processes in the dominance approach to the tcsm can be found in @xcite .",
    "the delphi and opal experiments at lep @xcite used dominance to obtain limits on @xmath66 and related processes in the tcsm .      the center of mass energies of lep and proposed future linear colliders are comparable to the expected masses of the lightest technihadrons in low ",
    "scale technicolor : a few hundred gev .",
    "hadron collider experiments are sensitive only to resonant technivector contributions , and therefore need consider only contributions from the poles . in contrast",
    ", lepton collider experiments have a broader sensitivity and may well be operating off the poles  especially when their location is unknown .",
    "for an  collider operating slightly below the poles , it is especially important to understand how the resonant and non  resonant contributions are combined .",
    "schematically , we would like to define a matrix element that interpolates between the anomaly mediated matrix element at the  production threshold and the -dominated matrix element in the region of the technivector poles , that is @xmath67^n + \\mathcal{m}_{{\\particle{v_t } } } \\left[1-f(s)\\right]^n\\ , \\ ] ] where the interpolating function @xmath68 has the limits @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "numerically , we find that either the anomaly  mediated or the mediated matrix element completely dominates the cross section , except in a relatively narrow region approximately midway between threshold and the first technivector pole , where they are of approximately equal magnitude ( see figure  [ fig : xsecs ] ) . because of this behavior , we gain little by implementing such a complicated scheme rather than simply taking @xmath71 in the above interpolation , that is , simply adding the relevant matrix elements everywhere .",
    "this gives us the correct limits , up to numerically irrelevant errors .",
    "adding the matrix elements has several virtues : it reproduces the correct cross - section both well below and in the region of the technivector meson resonances , and it is simple to implement .",
    "in addition , as will be shown shortly , the combined cross - sections still respect unitarity bounds in the energy range of experimental interest . at much higher energies ,",
    "our description will break down because additional resonances and continuum technifermion production will emerge , but that is not relevant to our purposes .    since the matrix element in equation  [ eq : anomaly - coupling ] for the anomaly  mediated coupling and the vectorial component in equation  [ eq : kinetic - coupling ] of the matrix element in the @xmath60-dominated scheme have the same lorentz structure , we add them . from the combined matrix elements , we obtain the cross section for @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a photon or a transversely polarized : @xmath74 here @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the mass of the final state gauge boson .",
    "the vectorial couplings for a given fermion helicity @xmath77 , including both  and anomaly terms , is given by @xmath78 where in contrast to equation  [ eqn : anomalyxsec ] , the anomaly contribution now includes off  diagonal mixing terms in the propagator , @xmath79  and @xmath80 , that are induced by the presence of the  and  in the vector spectrum .",
    "the axial couplings are given by @xmath81 once again , the @xmath82 coupling is @xmath83 .",
    "this method of combining the anomaly and  contributions applies more generally to fermion  antifermion annihilation into technipion plus transverse weak gauge boson at lepton and hadron colliders .",
    "the set of all such differential cross sections including anomaly and  terms and a tabulation of the various anomaly factors in the tcsm will appear in an updated version of @xcite .",
    "as an example of our results , we study in this section the process @xmath19 , both analytically and by means of pythia simulations .",
    "we remind the reader that  refers to both the  and . they can not be distinguished experimentally unless the  and   have significantly different masses and/or decay modes .",
    "note , however , that interference between production of  and  decaying to the same final state will not generally be significant because the  states are extremely narrow @xcite",
    ". only for @xmath84 would this be a concern . to represent the general expectations in the tcsm",
    ", we take @xmath85 throughout this section and in pythia , but do not include interference between the .",
    "as noted before , in the region of the technivector poles , the  mesons dominate other contributions , while well below the poles , the anomaly dominates . in between",
    ", there is a transition region where the contributions should be of the same order , and neither can be considered in isolation . because ( for our choice of technihadron masses ) this is the region in which lep experiments were done",
    ", the combined amplitudes may result in better limits on low  scale technicolor . in figure",
    "[ fig : xsecs ] , we plot the cross sections for the process @xmath19 for two  masses ( in figure  [ fig : light ] and in figure  [ fig : heavy ] ) , with a  mass of and a  mass in the tcsm ; here they are given somewhat different values so the characteristics of the resonances can be compared in the figures . ] of . from these plots ,",
    "the low energy anomaly dominance and pole region dominance are clear .",
    "the  resonance is stronger than the , because the  is narrower .",
    "we also see that the transition region is relatively narrow . for comparison with typical weak scale processes",
    ", we also plot the tree level standard model prediction for @xmath86 @xcite .    finally",
    ", we must ensure that the cross sections calculated above do not violate unitarity in any kinematic region of interest . for a vector mediated interaction ,",
    "both @xmath87 and @xmath88 partial waves contribute to the cross section , and the upper bound on the cross section from partial wave unitarity is given by @xmath89 ; this unitarity limit is also plotted in figure  [ fig : xsecs ] .",
    "the total cross section is well within the unitarity limit in all currently accessible kinematic regions .",
    "unitarity will be lost at inaccessibly high energies , but well before that point the model becomes invalid since it does not include higher mass technihadrons or continuum technifermion production .",
    "we now discuss our pythia studies of the process @xmath20 at the lep collider .",
    "the kinematics of the process dictate that the photon is hard and more central than would be expected in background processes .",
    "we define the signal to be a significant peak in the `` recoil mass '' recoiling against the photon @xmath90 for @xmath91{gev}$ ] and @xmath92 . to reduce backgrounds ,",
    "the photon must pass an isolation requirement : there must be no more than of excess energy within an opening angle of 30@xmath93 centered on the photon .",
    "since the technipion is expected to decay visibly , and predominantly to  quarks , we will impose a tag to eliminate the potentially large backgrounds from @xmath94 .",
    "we comment later on how to generalize this search .",
    "we simulated the signal at the particle level using pythia v6.202 @xcite , with updates to the technicolor simulation as specified in this paper .",
    "the proposed signature is a peak excess in the recoil mass distribution and a loose tag in the rest of the event .",
    "we are not sure how stringent a tag needs to be imposed and have not included any efficiency factors for the signal or fake rates from other quarks .",
    "we do not impose any kinematic cuts or jet  reconstruction algorithm on the particles recoiling from the photon , but require only a displaced vertex .",
    "the only background included is from @xmath95 . to account for the final  state radiation of photons off the partons , the full 2-to-3 parton",
    " level process is calculated at the matrix element  level . the parton level calculation is then interfaced to pythia , producing particle  level results that include the effects of parton showering and hadronization . after the isolation cut on the photon ,",
    "the results are in good agreement with the standard pythia simulation of @xmath96 .",
    "the implied suppression of radiation off the quark arises from several effects : ( 1 ) the small charge of the , ( 2 ) the large  quark mass , which regulates collinear emission , and ( 3 ) the kinematic constraints favoring a small invariant mass of the ( @xmath97 ) or ( @xmath98 ) systems , which is removed by the isolation cut .",
    "finally , we require that at least one of the partons ( after parton showering ) has a @xmath99 of at least . assuming that displaced vertices are detected with unit probability , this eliminates backgrounds from light quarks .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : pythia - a ] , assuming a collider energy of and @xmath100{pb^{-1}}$ ] of integrated luminosity . to demonstrate the variation with tcsm parameters",
    ", we have chosen five parameter sets starting with the baseline ( 1 ) : @xmath101{gev}$ ] , @xmath102 , @xmath103{gev}$ ] , and @xmath104{gev}$ ] .",
    "the @xmath105 and @xmath106 and , separately , the @xmath107 and @xmath108 are assumed to be degenerate in mass .",
    "the other parameter sets are variations on this baseline , with all parameters as in ( 1 ) except : for ( 2 ) , @xmath109{gev}$ ] ; for ( 3 ) , @xmath110 ; for ( 4 ) , @xmath111{gev}$ ] and @xmath112{gev}$ ] ; and , for ( 5 ) , @xmath113{gev}$ ] .",
    "the general tcsm condition @xmath114 obtains for all parameter sets .",
    "figure  [ fig : pythia - a ] shows also the significance defined as @xmath115 for each of the parameter sets .",
    "the baseline curve ( 1 ) includes a strong signal from the @xmath60 poles just above the collider energy .",
    "comparison with set ( 2 ) shows that the peak height scales as @xmath116 as we would expect from equation  [ eqn : vtxsec ] .",
    "comparison with set ( 4 ) , confirms the expected reduction of signal when the  and masses are scaled up to put the collider energy well below the poles .",
    "set ( 3 ) allows us to infer that , as in figure [ fig : xsecs ] , most of the  signal comes specifically from the . taking @xmath110 decouples the  from the gauge bosons and eliminates the @xmath117  coupling .",
    "the branching fraction for @xmath118 is also small for these tcsm parameters , even though the  is kinematically forbidden to decay to a pair of ; the dominant decay is to @xmath119 .",
    "then the small signal in set ( 3 ) reflects the size of contributions from the @xmath120  anomaly and the @xmath121 channel .",
    "the only possible source of the much larger peak in set ( 1 ) is the restored contribution of the . finally , in set ( 5 )",
    ", we deliberately open the ( dominant when present ) decay channel @xmath122 ; this would normally be closed because of large extended technicolor contributions to the masses  @xcite .",
    "although this significantly decreases the @xmath123 branching ratio , a strong signal of @xmath124 still occurs because  decays to two or three @xmath125 remain suppressed or forbidden . once again , the dominant role of the  in the signal is confirmed .",
    "figure  [ fig : pythia - b ] shows what the signals would look like if the anomaly couplings @xmath117  and @xmath120  were eliminated .",
    "the peak heights and significances are clearly reduced in all cases . for the parameter sets with the strongest signals ( 1,2,5 ) , a comparison with figure [ fig : pythia",
    "- a ] confirms that the resonance is largely responsible for making the production visible .",
    "this is what we would expect from the results we presented in figure 2 , because the mass of the resonance is just slightly higher than the @xmath5 of the collider .",
    "nonetheless , the anomaly couplings make a contribution that can be large enough to impact the limits extracted from the data .",
    "several further comments are in order .",
    "first , the signature discussed here is strongly dependent on the  properties , especially the coupling @xmath126 which is proportional to @xmath127 . in this respect",
    ", it is complementary to the @xmath128 signatures @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the tcsm may be naive in its assumption of certain mass degeneracies , and the  may be significantly lighter than the , yielding the first signature of technicolor .",
    "second , the proposed signature is not inclusive , but assumes the @xmath129 branching ratio is large ( the observation of some visible energy is necessary to remove the @xmath130 background ) .",
    "this is reasonable , but the solution to the flavor problem may bring surprises in the  decay rates .",
    "there may also be a substantial rate for @xmath131 ( this rate is already 30% for @xmath106 with the default tcsm choices as encoded in pythia ) , and there even may be appreciable mixing .",
    "therefore , while the first search should be tuned for the @xmath132 mode , we advocate a decay  independent search without the tag",
    ". the background should be 45 times bigger , reducing @xmath133 ( which is a few  to ",
    "one for the @xmath134 signature ) .",
    "it will not not reduce the significance very much ; we have defined it to include a systematic error on the background .",
    "for example , naively scaling the background estimate by 5 would reduce @xmath115 to @xmath135 , and @xmath136 for parameter sets @xmath137@xmath138 , respectively .",
    "this does not include the small increase in signal rate from all decays of the technipions .",
    "in the context of the tcsm , we have shown that both the anomaly and kinetic mixing contributions should be included in analyses of technipion production at lepton colliders .",
    "we have provided analytic formulas combining these contributions and used them to display the predictions of the tcsm for a range of technihadron masses and collider energies .",
    "we have also performed pythia simulations of @xmath19 including the modifications to the tcsm described in this paper for five distinct sets of technihadron masses and technifermion charges .",
    "we find that resonant production of technipions is necessary to ensure a visible signature at lep ii energies for typical tcsm parameters , but that including the non - resonant production will be important for setting accurate limits . finally , we note that measuring the recoil mass spectrum for @xmath0 production ( which we found to proceed mainly through the ) provides a technicolor search strategy that is complementary to the @xmath128 channel .",
