    "it is intuitive that the chemical composition and overall metallicity of the stellar outer layers must play a crucial role in determining the strength of the winds and the rate of mass loss .",
    "the basic description given above is the essence of the radiation driven wind theory , developed during the course of the last 30 years in a number of landmark papers .",
    "following the first suggestion by lucy & solomon ( 1970 ) , concerning the absorption of radiation in the ultraviolet resonance lines of ions such as civ , siiv and nv , recently detected at the time as p cygni profiles from rocket experiments , the mechanism of wind acceleration by metal line absorption has been developed further by castor , abbott & klein ( 1975 ) to include the approximate effect of a larger number of strong and weak metal lines .",
    "the theoretical framework has subsequently been perfected by the works of abbott ( 1982 ) and pauldrach , puls & kudritzki ( 1986 ) .",
    "approximate analytical solutions for velocity fields and mass - loss rates within this framework have been developed by kudritzki et al .",
    "state - of - the - art modeling techniques attain nowadays a realistic description of radiation driven winds , by solving the radiation transfer of millions of lines in an expanding atmosphere , producing synthetic spectra which match the observations of hot stars from the far - uv to the near - ir to a good degree of accuracy ( hillier & miller 1998 ; pauldrach , hoffmann & lennon 2001 ; puls et al .",

    "quite a broad range in the mass loss rate , @xmath5 , has been found among hot stars , scaling roughly with stellar luminosity as @xmath6 ( de jager , nieuwenhuijzen & van der hucht  1988 ; garmany & conti  1984 ) during the main sequence and the supergiant phase ( it is actually the modified wind momentum which scales with some power of the luminosity , as described later ) .",
    "typical values up to a few times @xmath7yr@xmath8 are found among such stars .",
    "wolf - rayet stars possess denser winds , with mass loss rates up to one order of magnitude higher than o stars , while even more extreme values , up to @xmath9yr@xmath8 , can be found among luminous blue variables .",
    "for central stars of planetary nebulae @xmath10yr@xmath8 , in virtue of their lower luminosities ( see the recent review by kudritzki and puls  2000 for further information on stellar wind properties ) .    evidently such rates of mass loss profoundly influence the evolution of massive stars ( chiosi & maeder 1986 ) .",
    "moreover , winds from massive stars are relevant for the calculation of chemical yields and their inclusion in chemical evolution models of galaxies ( maeder 1992 ; portinari , chiosi & bressan 1998 ) .",
    "stellar rotation has also been shown to significantly affect the evolution of massive stars , in particular by enhancing mass loss rates and modifying the surface and wind chemical composition ( meynet & maeder 2000 ) .",

    "expanded possibilities have appeared with the advent of 8-to-10 meter telescopes , which allow us to extend the spectroscopic study of individual stars even beyond the local group .",
    "quantitative stellar spectroscopy in external galaxies is becoming important for a number of projects dealing with stellar abundances , the distance scale , the evolution of massive stars , the characterization of supernova progenitors , and the instabilities of massive stars in the very upper part of the h - r diagram , near the humphreys - davidson limit .",

    "let us consider a hot and massive star radiating a total luminosity @xmath16 out of its photosphere .",
    "the outer layers will be accelerated by radiation pressure through absorption in the metal lines .",
    "the maximum total momentum available from the radiation field is @xmath17 , so that we can expect a dependence of the mechanical momentum flow : @xmath18    as a result of this transfer of momentum from the radiation to the ions , the wind is accelerated , starting from the photospheric layers , up to the asymptotic terminal velocity @xmath19 .",
    "the observed stellar wind velocity fields are customarily parameterized as a ` @xmath20-law ' , given here in its simplest form :      for the hot o stars @xmath22 , therefore the ions are efficiently accelerated right above the photosphere , while for later - type a supergiants a more progressive acceleration takes place , corresponding to @xmath23 .                of these three terms",
    ", only the second one ( the acceleration due to line absorption ) needs to be considered in more detail , the first one ( thomson scattering ) will be included as a constant reduction of the gravity @xmath29 , whereas the third one ( free - free+bound - free transitions ) is negligible in the winds of hot stars .        with @xmath32 being the correction factor which accounts for the finite extension of the stellar disk .",

    "( i.e.  the line opacity divided by the thomson opacity @xmath35 , see kudritzki and puls  2000 ) , gives the optical depth in a given line transition in a supersonically expanding atmosphere :            thus depending on the effective number of metal lines driving the wind , @xmath39 , and on the optical depth through the line force parameter @xmath4 .",
    "solving the equation of motion ( [ eom ] ) with this parameterization of the line force one obtains scaling relations for the mass - loss rate and the terminal velocity ( kudritzki et al .",
    "1989 ) :        the origin of the @xmath30 expression used in the proportionality ( [ gradeq ] ) lies in the statistics of the strengths of the wind - driving lines , which can be described by a simple _ line strength distribution function_. it is found that , to a good approximation , the number of lines of a given strength @xmath34 follows a power - law ( fig .  [ df ] ) :      the exponent @xmath4 , which determines the slope of the distribution function , is mostly set by the laws of atomic physics ( the distribution function of oscillator strengths ) , and is found to vary between 0.5 and 0.7 ( for the hydrogen lyman - series one would obtain @xmath4=2/3 ) .",
    "@xmath39 ( see equations [ gradeq ] , [ scale ] ) is related to the normalization of the line strength distribution function .",

    "the line distribution function plays a primary role in the mechanisms governing radiation driven winds ( see puls , springmann & lennon 2000 for an in - depth study ) , and it is worthwile spending a few additional words in relation to the type of ions which are most effective in driving the wind .",
    "it is clear that such ions will differ among stars of different chemical composition and/or effective temperatures , since the predominant ionizations stages will change accordingly .",
    "what kind of lines are driving the wind ?",
    "the most prominent metal line transitions are located in the far - uv and uv spectral ranges . as the emitted stellar flux peaks at smaller frequencies with decreasing @xmath1 ,",
    "so does the spectral range containing the lines contributing the most at driving the wind .",
    "the calculations by abbott ( 1982 ) and puls et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show that lines of high - ionization stages of o , n , p and other heavy elements , located approximately between 800 and 1200 , are the dominant source of acceleration in the hottest ( 40,000@xmath44 ) stars . at lower temperatures ( 10,00020,000@xmath44 ) lower ionization species ( such as feii , feiii , mgii , caii ) , having transitions at longer wavelengths , become predominant .",

    "[ df ] shows , at lower temperature the number of iron group lines present , mostly feii-*iii * , increases , determining a steepening of the line distribution function , and a consequent decrease in @xmath4 .",
    "we can now answer our question regarding the origin of the metallicity dependence of the mass loss , based on the understanding of the line statistics briefly discussed so far .",
    "there are two main effects :        so that the distribution functions in fig .",
    "[ df ] shift horizontally in the plotted plane .",
    "consequently , the normalization over the range @xmath48 changes with metallicity , affecting the effective number of lines driving the wind :      @xmath50 a metallicity dependence of @xmath4 , coming from the curvature of the line distribution function , which tends to become steeper at high line strengths ( see puls et al .",
    "2000 for the details ) .",
    "it is important to note that the local acceleration in the wind comes mostly from lines with @xmath51 .",
    "this means that strong winds are driven by lines with smaller line strengths , whereas weak winds rely on the acceleration of the fewer lines with large line strengths .",

    "( [ scale ] ) . at very low metallicities ( below @xmath56 ) these relations break down , and",
    "the depth dependence of the line force multipliers must be taken into account ( kudritzki 2002 ) .",
    "we also conclude from fig .",
    "[ df ] that a change of the relative abundance ratio of @xmath4 elements to fe group elements will have an additional effect .      the first , obvious observational test of the effects of metallicity on the stellar winds of massive stars concerns the terminal velocities .",
    "these are easily measured from the p cygni profiles of resonance lines in the uv , e.g.  civ@xmath57 and siiv@xmath58 . a clear decrease of @xmath19 is found when comparing the terminal velocities measured in the milky way with those in the magellanic clouds , especially in the lower metallicity smc ( garmany & conti 1985 ; kudritzki & puls 2000 ) .",

    "the bulk of the measurements available for massive stars comes from h@xmath4 line profile fits .",
    "however , when correlating @xmath5 with , for example , the luminosity @xmath16 , a significant scatter is found , as a consequence of the dependence on the effective mass ( see eq .  [ scale ] ) .",

    "<S> photospheric radiation momentum is efficiently transferred by absorption through metal lines to the gaseous matter in the atmospheres of massive stars , sustaining strong winds and mass loss rates . not only is this critical for the evolution of such stars </S>",
    "<S> , it also provides us with diagnostic uv / optical spectral lines for the determination of mass loss rates , chemical abundances and absolute stellar luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> we review the mechanisms which render the wind parameters sensitive to the chemical composition , through the statistics of the wind - driving lines . </S>",
    "<S> observational evidence in support of the radiation driven wind theory is presented , with special regard to the wind momentum - luminosity relationship and the blue supergiant work carried out by our team in galaxies outside of the local group .    </S>",
