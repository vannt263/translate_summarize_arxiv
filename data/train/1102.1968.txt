    "the kinetic theory of gases had played a pivotal role in the development of statistical mechanics , which is more than a century old .",
    "this theory describes a gas as a collection of a large number of particles ( atoms or molecules ) which are constantly in random motion , and these rapidly moving particles constantly collide with each other and exchange energy . in the ideal gas , this energy is only kinetic .",
    "recently physicists have been studying two - body kinetic exchange models in the socio - economic contexts in the rapidly growing interdisciplinary field of `` sociophysics '' @xcite and `` econophysics '' @xcite .",
    "the two - body exchange dynamics has been developed in the context of modeling income , money or wealth distributions in a society @xcite , and modeling opinion formation in the society @xcite , analogous to the kinetic theory model of ideal gases .",
    "these studies have given deeper insights and different perspectives in the simple physics of two body kinetic exchange dynamics .",
    "in this context of wealth exchange processes , iglesias et al . had considered a model for the economy where the poorest in the society ( atom with least energy in the gas ) at any stage takes the initiative to go for a trade ( random wealth / energy exchange ) with anyone else .",
    "interestingly , in the steady state , one obtained a self - organized poverty line , below which none could be found and above which , a standard exponential decay of the distribution ( gibbs ) was obtained .    here , we study a model where @xmath0 particles , interact among themselves through two - body energy ( @xmath1 ) conserving stochastic scatterings with at least one of the particles having energy below a threshold @xmath2 ( poverty line in the equivalent economic model ) .",
    "the states of particles are characterized by the energy @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 and the total energy @xmath5 is conserved (= @xmath0 here , such that the average energy of the system @xmath6 ) .",
    "the evolution of the system is carried out according to the following dynamics : @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( threshold energy or `` poverty line '' ) and @xmath9 @xmath10 is a stochastic variable , changing with time ( scattering ) .",
    "it can be noticed that , the quantity @xmath1 is conserved during each collision : @xmath11 .",
    "the question of interest is : `` what is the steady state distribution @xmath12 of energy @xmath1 in such systems ? ''    in the standard case , when the threshold energy goes to infinity ( @xmath13 ) , we know that the steady state energy distribution will be the exponential gibbs distribution ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "however , when a finite threshold energy is introduced ( @xmath15 ) , several new and intriguing features appear .",
    "these features are exhibited not only in the mean field version ( with infinite - range interaction , pairs of particles randomly chosen from @xmath0 particles ) but also in the lattice versions ( with nearest neighbor interactions , i.e. exchanges between the nearest neighbors on lattice sites ) .",
    "we simulate a system of @xmath0 particles ( agents ) . at any time @xmath16 , we select randomly a particle @xmath17 . if the energy of the particle is below a prescribed threshold energy @xmath2 , then it collides with any other random particle @xmath18 ( in the mean field model ) which can have any energy whatsoever , and the two particles will exchange energy according to the gibbs - boltzmann dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ed1 ] ) . after each such successful collision , the time is incremented by unity .",
    "the dynamics will continue for an indefinite period , unless there is no particle left below the threshold energy , in which case the dynamics will freeze . if the dynamics gets frozen ( when @xmath19 for all @xmath17 ) , we employ a ` mild ' perturbation such that a randomly chosen particle will be dropped to the lower level ( @xmath20 ) by giving up its energy to anyone else ( to ensure total energy conservation ) .",
    "it can be shown that the addition of this perturbation does not alter the relevant quantities for a thermodynamically large systems , and simply ensures ergodicity in the system .",
    "after sufficiently large time @xmath21 , a steady state is reached when the energy distribution @xmath12 ( and also other average quantities ) do not change with time .",
    "we start with different initial random configurations , where the states of particles are characterized by the energies @xmath3 , which are drawn randomly from an uniform distribution such that @xmath4 and the average energy @xmath22 is set to unity .",
    "we find the system to be _ ergodic _ ( the steady state distribution @xmath12 is _ independent _ of the initial conditions @xmath23 ) , and we take steady state averages over all such independent initial conditions to evaluate the quantities of interest .",
    "we study mainly three cases ( a ) mean field ( or infinite range ) case where @xmath17 and @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ed1 ] ) can represent any two particles / agents in the system ;",
    "( b ) one dimensional case where @xmath24 along a chain and ( c ) two dimensional case , where @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents neighbors of @xmath17 . in our studies we consider a 2d - square lattice .",
    "we observe that for finite values of the energy threshold @xmath2 , the steady state energy distribution is no longer the simple gibbs - boltzmann distribution .",
    "we also find that @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , the average number of particles below the threshold energy in the steady state , is zero for @xmath2 values below or at a critical threshold energy @xmath29 , and for @xmath30 , @xmath27 is non - zero .",
    "the steady state value of @xmath27 , the average number of particles below the threshold energy @xmath2 is seen to act like an `` order parameter '' of the system .",
    "we study the relaxation dynamics in the system : the relaxation of @xmath31 to the steady state value of @xmath27 ( @xmath32 for @xmath33 , the `` relaxation time '' ) .",
    "we find @xmath34 grows as @xmath2 approaches @xmath29 , and eventually diverges at @xmath29 .",
