    "forty years after their discovery , the nature of the material making up the core of neutron stars remains largely unknown . at densities above a few times the equilibrium density of nuclear matter",
    ", models predict the existence of exotic components such as pion or kaon condensates or unconfined quarks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the exciting idea that neutron stars may contain exotic forms of matter makes them of prime interest , not only for astrophysics but for physics in general .",
    "different equations of state of dense matter predict different maximum masses and different mass - radius relationships .",
    "so far accurate mass measurements have been made for radio pulsars giving masses ranging from 1.18@xmath1 m@xmath0 , for the case of one of the pulsars in psr j1756 - 2251 @xcite to 1.4414@xmath2 m@xmath0 , for psr b1913 + 16 @xcite .",
    "such low values can be accommodated by a wide range of equations of states and do not provide a strong constraint on the composition of dense matter .",
    "there is however growing evidence that neutron stars , as massive as 2 m@xmath0 , may also exist , in particular in accreting x - ray binaries , as inferred from the study of the properties of kilo - hz qpos ( quasi - periodic oscillations ) ( e.g. the neutron star in 4u 1636 - 536 which is estimated to have a mass of 1.9 - 2.1 m@xmath0 @xcite ) and binary millisecond pulsars that are no longer accreting ( e.g. psr j0751 + 1807 , which has a mass measured through relativistic orbital decay of 2.1@xmath30.2 m@xmath0 , * ? ? ?",
    "if the latter estimates are confirmed ( by dynamical mass estimates of the binary components ) , they would rule out some exotic forms of matter , such as quarks or pion condensates .",
    "while there are some accurate mass measurements already available , the situation is different with radii which are much harder to constrain .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy is one promising avenue to follow to tackle this issue .",
    "so far , there has been one single ( and still debated ) measurement of redshifted absorption lines in the combined early and late type i x - ray burst spectra of the x - ray binary exo 0748 - 676 .",
    "the line energies are consistent with fexxvi h@xmath4 ( n = 2 - 3 ) and fexxv he@xmath4 ( n = 2 - 3 ) , respectively , both at the same redshift z = 0.350@xmath30.005 @xcite .",
    "the measured redshift provided a direct estimate of mass / radius ( m / r ) ( @xmath5 ) . assuming a canonical mass of 1.4 m@xmath0",
    ", this would imply a radius of about 9 km .",
    "following this result , and using the burst properties , @xcite estimated both mass and radius separately .",
    "this led to a massive neutron star with a mass m @xmath6m@xmath0 ( and r@xmath7 km ) in exo 0748 - 676 , a result suggesting again that if this system is typical , exotic forms of matter , such as condensates and unconfined quarks do not exist in neutron star cores .",
    "another promising way of inferring radii is through observations of quiescent x - ray emission from neutron stars for which the distance ( d ) can be estimated reliably ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the flux and radiation temperatures redshifted to the earth and @xmath11 is the radiation radius ) . whether the energy reservoir is the heat deposited deep in the neutron star crust during the outburst phase of the transient @xcite , or sustained by a low - level of radial accretion @xcite ( via an advection dominated accretion flow ) , the x - rays originate from the atmosphere of the neutron star .",
    "the spectrum radiated by the atmosphere will depend on its actual composition , the strength and the structure of the magnetic field .",
    "in general , it is thought that the old neutron stars in globular clusters have low magnetic fields and hydrogen - rich atmospheres ( gravitational settling of heavier elements occurs rapidly , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "early non magnetic hydrogen atmosphere models have been shown to provide adequate fits to the quiescent x - ray spectra of several neutron star systems , all providing plausible values for the neutron star radius ( typically around 10 km , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "compared to neutron stars in the field , those in globular clusters have accurate distance estimates , and the fitting of their very soft spectra is made easier by the fact that at least the value of the interstellar absorption derived from the optical extinction is well known , even if the absorption intrinsic to the system is largely unknown .    following the work done by @xcite on chandra data of the quiescent neutron star x - ray binary x7 in",
    ", we apply recently improved neutron star atmosphere models , available in the latest release of the xspec spectral fitting package ( version 12.3.0 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to three neutron stars in quiescent x - ray binaries that we have observed in three globular clusters with xmm - newton .",
    "this is part of an on - going program to locate , identify and classify faint x - ray sources in globular clusters @xcite , with an aim to determining the internal energy source that slows down the inevitable collapse of globular clusters .",
    "early fitting of the x - ray spectra with the first hydrogen - atmosphere models of @xcite assuming a constant surface gravity ( log g@xmath12=14.385 , corresponding to a 1.4 m@xmath0 and 10 km radius neutron star ) , were reported for and in @xcite . however , as emphasised by @xcite , using models with appropriate surface gravity for each fitted value of the mass and radius of the neutron star is important when interpreting high quality x - ray spectra , which is indeed the case for the spectra measured with xmm - newton .",
    "applying the improved models is the main motivation of this paper , which further benefits from improved data analysis software and calibration of the epic instruments compared to the earlier published results on these sources .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the observations , recalling the essential parameters of the clusters ( distance , extinction , ... ) , the data reduction and present the results of the spectral fitting .",
    "we use , for comparison purposes three different models , described hereafter .",
    "we have observations of the three likely neutron stars in three different globular clusters , ( @xmath13 cen ) , and .",
    "observations of each of these clusters were made with the x - ray observatory xmm - newton .",
    "all three epic cameras were used in the full - frame mode with the medium filter .",
    "further information about these observations can be found in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "[ tab : obs ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         all the data were binned to contain a minimum of 20 counts per bin where possible and we used the @xmath14 technique to judge the goodness of the model fits . however , for and the data were binned with 15 counts per bin ( to increase the number of data points ) . in these cases",
    "we used the c - statistic to judge the goodness of the fit , as the number of counts per bin is no longer strictly in the gaussian statistics regime but approaches that of the poissonian statistics regime . even though we are at the limit between the two regimes , the c - statistic has been shown to work well at even higher counts @xcite and",
    "should therefore give good results .",
    "the inverse is not necessarily true .",
    "@xcite showed that using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( the algorithm used in xspec ) for small numbers of events per bin gives a systematic bias .      for each model we included ( photoelectric ) absorption along the line of sight to the object .",
    "this was initially fixed at the value determined for each cluster ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) and then allowed to vary . in every case we found that we required additional absorbing material , assumed to be additional gas intrinsic to the system .",
    "this was typically 30 - 60% more i.e. @xmath13 cen required an n@xmath15@xmath160.11 @xmath17 @xmath18 , an increase of 60% with a ftest probability of 0.0099 , indicating that it is reasonable to include additional material .",
    "the normalisation was fixed to the value corresponding to the distance to the cluster ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) and the masses and radii were initially frozen to 1.4 m@xmath0 and 10.0 km , but then allowed to vary .",
    "we then tried to constrain the nature of the additional absorbing material , in the same way as heinke et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , by employing the _ xspec _ model _ vphabs _ and using the abundances corresponding to those of each of the clusters . for we chose the iron abundance to be 3% solar ( [ fe / h ] = -1.5 ) , the abundances of c , n and o to be 5% solar ( [ x / h ] = -1.32 ) , the abundances of ne to ca to be 4% solar ( [ x / h ] = -1.38 ) and that of helium to be of solar abundance , following cohen & melendez ( 2005 ) . for @xmath13 cen the situation is more complicated as there are three distinct populations of stars in this cluster , see e.g. origlia et al .",
    "we elected the abundances from the largest population in the cluster , basing our choice on the fact that the highest probability was that the donor star comes from the largest population .",
    "we adopt the iron abundance to be 3% solar ( [ fe / h ] = -1.58 ) , the abundances of c , n and o to be 6% solar ( [ x / h ] = -1.24 ) , the abundances of ne to ca to be 6% solar ( [ x / h ] = -1.19 ) and again that of helium to be of solar abundance , following origlia et al . (",
    "2003 ) and norris ( 2004 ) . for ngc 2808",
    "we select the iron abundance to be 9% solar ( [ fe / h ] = -1.06 ) , the abundances of c , n and o to be 32% solar ( [ x / h ] = -0.5 ) , the abundances of ne to ca to be 16% solar ( [ x / h ] = -0.8 ) and that of helium to be of solar abundance , following castellani et al . (",
    "2006 ) and gratton ( 1982 ) .",
    "again , however , it is believed that ngc 2808 has as many as three populations of stars , with different abundances ( piotto et al .",
    "we chose the abundances for the only population with sufficient information in the literature .",
    "we then modelled the neutron star spectra fixing the photoelectric absorption ( phabs ) to be that of the cluster and allowing the photoelectric absorption with variable abundances ( vphabs ) to vary ( using the abundances given above ) .",
    "the results that we obtained gave very small masses and/or radii , often small enough to hit the lower mass or radius limit allowed in the models ( see below for values ) .",
    "cen with the best nsatmos model fit and the residuals to the fit .",
    "the different symbols indicate the data from the different instruments used : filled circles show mos 1 data , filled squares show mos 2 data and filled diamonds show pn data . ]    . ]",
    "we thus decided to determine whether our data are of sufficiently good quality to constrain the nature of the additional absorbing material .",
    "we simulated a spectrum similar to that obtained for @xmath13 cen , using the simple phabs model .",
    "we modelled this spectrum in _ xspec _ using first the phabs model and then the vphabs model .",
    "we obtained similar @xmath19 values ( 1.17 , 78 dof when using phabs and 1.29 , 78 dof when using vphabs ) , but again the masses and radii were very low when the vphabs model was employed , only @xmath1680% of the value given to simulate the spectrum as opposed to values within 10% when using the phabs model .",
    "we also simulated the same spectrum but using the vphabs model .",
    "again , modelling this spectrum in xspec using the vphabs model we found values as low as 33% of the original value , yet when modelling with the phabs model our values are within 5% of our original values .",
    "further , we obtain equally good fits using vphabs to our simulated spectrum ( @xmath19=1.09 , 78 dof ) when we choose abundances that are different by 300% to those used in the simulated spectrum , and we still have the problem that either the mass or the radius is very small . we therefore conclude that the quality of our data is insufficient to constrain the nature of the additional absorbing material and we use the phabs model only .",
    "we also investigated whether we required an extra power law tail , especially for the two neutron stars found in proximity of other sources i.e. the neutron stars in m 13 and ngc 2808 .",
    "this is important as substantial flux from other sources is likely to be the dominant source of counts in the higher energy bands ( i.e. above 1 kev ) .",
    "this may tend to systematically bias the spectral fits to higher temperatures , and thus smaller radii .    to do this we extracted the spectra of the neighbouring sources and determined their photon indices ( @xmath20@xmath161.75 for m 13 and @xmath20@xmath161.5 for ngc 2808 ) .",
    "we then estimated the contribution from the neighbouring sources in the extraction region for each neutron star ( 8% for m 13 and 20% for ngc 2808 , see figs  [ fig : m13ext ] and [ fig : ngc2808ext ] ) .",
    "we used these values and refitted our spectra .",
    "interestingly , we found values very similar to those obtained when no power law was included . even allowing the normalisation to increase , increasing the weight of the power law , made little difference to the fits .",
    "ftests show that adding the power law is not necessary .",
    "probability results for fitting nsa , nsatmos and nsagrav models with and without the additional power laws to the neutron star in m 13 are 0.31 , 0.22 and 0.199 respectively and to the neutron star in ngc 2808 are 0.13 , 0.06 and 0.08 respectively .",
    "we therefore conclude that adding a power law is not required by the data .",
    "the spectra of the three neutron stars can be found in figs .",
    "[ fig : m13]-[fig : ngc2808 ] , along with the best fitting nsatmos model .",
    "the principal goal of our spectral fitting is to self - consistently constrain the allowed space in mass and radius using our three neutron stars , but also to test the reliability and accuracy of the three models examined .",
    "table  [ tab : res ] gives the best fits for each neutron star fitted with each of the three models , along with the best fitting values for the column densities , surface temperatures of the neutron stars , masses and radii .",
    "errors are also given at the 90% confidence limit for the one interesting parameter .",
    "to calculate the errors , the mass and distance were held fixed and all other parameters were allowed to vary , except when calculating the error on the mass , when the radius was held fixed instead of the mass .",
    "we also give the estimated bolometric luminosity of the neutron star .",
    "we found that we did not require any additional parameters , such as lines or edges to fit these data .",
    "however , this may be due to the quality of the data , where deeper observations may reveal spectral features that will be useful to constrain the gravitational redshift at the ns surface @xcite .    ) and the radii ( km ) are plotted along with neutron star equations of state taken from @xcite ]     cen ( solid / red line ) and ngc 2808 ( dotted / blue line ) with the xspec model nsatmos .",
    "the 90% and 99% confidence contours for the neutron star masses ( m@xmath0 ) and the radii ( km ) are plotted along with neutron star equations of state taken from @xcite ]     cen ( solid / red line ) and x7 in 47 tuc ( dashed - dotted / green line ) @xcite with the xspec model nsatmos .",
    "the 99% confidence contours for the neutron star masses ( m@xmath0 ) and the radii ( km ) are plotted along with neutron star equations of state taken from @xcite .",
    "the grey hashed region indicates the region not investigated with the models . ]",
    "we use the steppar command in xspec to vary both the radius and mass parameters simultaneously , allowing the temperature to vary as well to find the best fit .",
    "the minimum ( and maximum ) radii allowed with these models are 5 km ( 30/20 km ) for the nsatmos and nsa models respectively and 6 km ( 20 km ) for the nsagrav model .",
    "we chose an inferior limit of 8 km and a superior limit of 18 km as all three models gave stable results when fitting the data in these regions .",
    "the minimum ( and maximum ) masses allowed with these models are 0.5m@xmath0 ( 3.0/2.5m@xmath0 ) for the nsatmos and nsa models respectively and 0.3m@xmath0 ( 2.5m@xmath0 ) for the nsagrav model .",
    "we chose the region between 0.5 and 2.3m@xmath0 as again all three models gave stable results in these regions .",
    "we show 90% confidence , and 99% confidence ( @xmath21 = 4.61 , and 9.21 respectively ) contours in neutron star mass and radius .",
    "[ fig : m13cont ] shows the results of modelling the neutron star in with all three neutron star atmosphere models .",
    "this figure indicates that the two models , nsatmos and nsagrav , give comparable results , whereas the nsa model gives differing results .",
    "the nsa model is more accurate in constraining r@xmath22 than the nsatmos and nsagrav models , due to a degeneracy in spectral shape variations between the surface gravity and the surface temperature .",
    "however , here we calculate a range of neutron star masses and radii , for which the nsatmos and nsagrav , thanks to their variable surface gravities , are better adapted ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the use of these fixed gravity models for testing neutron stars with a variety of masses and radii ( and therefore gravities ) is not therefore strictly appropriate .",
    "this is borne out by the modelling .",
    "for this reason and to simplify the following plots , we ignore the nsa model ( as it is less accurate ) and we plot only the nsatmos model ( as the nsagrav and nsatmos models are similar ) to show the constraints on mass and radius determined by modelling and ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ocencont ] ) .",
    "the loci of models for the equations of state for dense matter are those described in @xcite and @xcite which include diverse equations such as : sqm - @xcite , a strange quark matter model , pal - @xcite a neutron and proton model using a schematic potential , gm - @xcite , a model containing neutrons , protons and hyperons using a field theoretical approach , gs - @xcite , a model containing neutrons , protons and kaons using a field theoretical approach .",
    "as seen in section  [ sec : spec ] even if the nsa model is more accurate in constraining r@xmath22 than the nsatmos and nsagrav models , when calculating a range of neutron star masses and radii , we find that the nsatmos and nsagrav models are better adapted .",
    "we conclude that the use of fixed gravity models for testing neutron stars with a variety of masses and radii ( and therefore gravities ) is not strictly appropriate as previously indicated by @xcite and @xcite .    using the results from figs .",
    "[ fig : m13cont ] and [ fig : ocencont ] , and the results found by @xcite when fitting chandra observations of x7 in 47 tuc , we show the allowed equations of state in fig .",
    "[ fig:3cont ] . modelling",
    "the neutron star in alone shows that the data do not favour the stiffer equations of state , such as ms0 - 2 and pal 1 .",
    "we combine these results with those from modelling the neutron star in . the low quality data for the neutron star in results in very poor constraints for this object and hence we disregard this source in the discussion , although the results seem to be similar to those for the neutron star in .",
    "the equations of state that are satisfied by all three neutron stars fall in the middle of the diagram and includes the equations of state of normal nucleonic matter and one strange quark matter model .",
    "the equations allowed are gs1 , pal 6 , ap3 & 4 , gm3 , fsu , sqm3 , eng and mpa1 , with radii above 8 km and masses up to 2.4 m@xmath0 .",
    "this article was based on observations obtained with xmm - newton , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
    "the authors thank j. lattimer for providing them with the mass - radius relationships for the different equations of state shown in figures  [ fig : m13cont]-[fig:3cont ] and b. gendre for help with the rosat spectrum .",
