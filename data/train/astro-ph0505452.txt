    "the current standard model of structure formation , in which the universe is dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) , predicts that dark matter halos have an inner cusp that is shallower than a singular isothermal sphere model .",
    "specifically , the radial density profile can be well fitted by an nfw profile @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "an important parameter of this model is the concentration parameter @xmath5 , the ratio of the virial radius to the scale radius @xmath6 . for massive clusters ,",
    "it is predicted to be @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these are quite important predictions that should be confronted with observations .",
    "now it is becoming possible to _ directly _ test the nfw predictions using gravitational lensing .",
    "a poster child example for this is a1689 : the inner mass distribution is tightly constrained from more than 100 multiple images of background galaxies discovered from the spectacular deep advanced camera for surveys ( acs)/hubble space telescope ( hst ) data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b05b ) , while the larger scale mass distribution up to the virial radius is obtained from the weak lensing measurements based on the wide - field suprime - cam / subaru data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b05a ) .",
    "the two - dimensional mass profile of a1689 , reconstructed from the combined lensing information , does continuously flatten towards the center like an nfw profile , but the fitting to the nfw predictions leads to a surprisingly high concentration @xmath8 ( b05a ) , compared with the expected value @xmath9 .",
    "such a high concentration is also seen in other clusters , e.g. , ms2137 - 23 @xcite and possibly cl 0024 + 1654 @xcite .",
    "these results may represent a new crisis in the current standard cdm model , offering a very rewarding issue to further explore .",
    "however , the constraints above are obtained by deprojecting the two - dimensional lensing information under assumption of the spherically symmetric mass distribution .",
    "what the cdm model does predict is that dark halos are quite triaxial rather than spherical as a natural consequence of the collision - less dark matter nature and the filamentary nature of structure formation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter js02 ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the results obtained assuming spherical symmetry might be biased ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the similar discussion on a1689 ) .",
    "in fact , @xcite argued that the halo triaxiality affects both mass and concentration parameter measurements from gravitational lensing using @xmath10-body simulation results of clusters .",
    "@xcite also investigated the importance of the halo triaxiality and argued that a high concentration of ms2137 - 23 could be explained by a halo having the major axis oriented toward the line - of - sight .    in this paper , we study the mass distribution of a1689 based on triaxial dark halo model .",
    "specifically , we adopt the triaxial halo model of js02 , and focus on whether the apparent steep mass profile of a1689 can be ascribed to triaxiality of the mass distribution . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a concordance cosmology with the matter density @xmath11 , the cosmological constant @xmath12 , the dimensionless hubble constant @xmath13 , and the normalization of matter power spectrum @xmath14 .",
    "note that one arcminute corresponds to the physical scale of @xmath15kpc for a1689 ( redshift @xmath16 ) .",
    "before going to the analysis of a1689 , we make a simple test to demonstrate how important the halo triaxiality is in constraining mass profiles from a two - dimensional lensing measurement .",
    "the analysis is somewhat similar to that done by @xcite who used high - resolution @xmath10-body simulations of massive clusters .",
    "here we instead use an analytic model of aspherical dark halos .",

    "we have checked that the spherically - averaged radial mass profile of the triaxial halo is quite similar to the spherical nfw profile that is specified by the virial radius @xmath41 , as proposed in js02 ( see figure 14 in js02 ) , and the concentration parameter @xmath42 , is at least 5 times larger than the spherical overdensity @xmath43 , the concentration parameter in the triaxial model tends to be smaller than those in the spherical model ( approximately given as @xmath44 ) .",
    "see js02 for details . ] .",
    "however , it is non - trivial for these triaxial and spherical models whether to yield similar lensing maps as a result of the line - of - sight projection is given in terms of the surface mass density @xmath45 as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the lensing critical density specified for a background cosmology and lens and source redshifts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "] . to make this clear , figure [ fig : kap ] compares the circularly - averaged convergence profiles for the spherical and triaxial halos . for the triaxial halo",
    ", we consider the projection along each of the three principal axes .",
    "it is clear that the surface mass density of the triaxial halo depends strongly on the projection direction .",
    "therefore it is quite likely that adopting a spherical halo model causes a bias in estimating the mass and profile parameters for an individual cluster in reality .    to see this more clearly",
    ", we perform the following test . first , we generate an `` observed '' surface mass density profile : we consider 20 bins logarithmically spacing over the range @xmath48h^{-1}{\\rm mpc}$ ] , and generate the convergence profile @xmath49 , where the mean value for each bin is taken from the triaxial halo model and the gaussian random error of standard deviation @xmath50 is added to each bin .",
    "then , assuming the spherical nfw density profile , we constrain the virial mass ( @xmath51 ) and halo concentration parameter ( @xmath52 ) by fitting the model predictions to the `` observed '' profile .",
    "the constraint contours in the @xmath53 plane are shown in figure [ fig : chi ] , demonstrating that the best - fit parameters depend strongly on the projection direction .",
    "for example , the convergence profile projected along the major ( minor ) axis yields a significant overestimation ( underestimation ) by @xmath54 in _ both _ the mass and concentration parameters .",
    "it should be noted that the bias direction is orthogonal to the degeneracy direction of the error ellipse , implying the systematics is very important .",
    "in fact , we fail to recover the model parameters of the spherically - averaged triaxial profile at more than 3-@xmath2 level when the halo is projected along the major- or minor - axis directions .",
    "in this section , we indeed make a quantitative interpretation of the lensing measurements of a1689 in terms of the triaxial halo model in order to derive more reliable constraints on the three - dimensional mass distribution than does assuming the spherical halo model . our particular attention is paid to whether or not the steep mass profile claimed in b05a",
    "can be reconciled with the cdm - based triaxial halo model of js02 .    following the method of @xcite ,",
    "the model lensing convergence field for a triaxial halo is specified by 7 parameters .",
    "as explained around equation ( [ gnfw ] ) , the _ virial _ radius of the triaxial halo modeling @xmath37 , the concentration parameter @xmath55 , and the axis ratio parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 are considered .",
    "further , we adopt three angle parameters to specify the halo orientation : @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ? * ) and the third angle between major axis of an ellipse of the projected mass distribution and the ra direction on the sky .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath58 gives the angle between the major axis of the triaxial halo and the line - of - sight direction .",
    "we again note that , in this model , the virial mass @xmath51 is not a free parameter but is derivable from the model parameters ( @xmath37 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) . throughout this paper , we assume @xmath60 for the mean redshift of source galaxies as done in b05a .",
    "we then constrain the 7 model parameters from @xmath61 fitting to the observed convergence map obtained from the acs / hst and suprime - cam / subaru data ( e.g. see b05a for the similar method ) : @xmath62 where we adopt flat priors of @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the axis ratios because a small axis ratio such as @xmath65 is unrealistic for a virialized halo . for the acs data , we use the circularly - averaged profile of the obtained convergence map that is given in 12 bins linearly spacing over the range @xmath66 $ ] ( see figure 22 in b05b or figure 3 in b05a ) . hence , the @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the model prediction of the triaxial halo for the @xmath70-th radial bin , computed as in figure [ fig : kap ] , and the @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the observed value and @xmath73-@xmath2 error , respectively . as for the subaru data , we use the two - dimensional convergence map @xmath74 reconstructed from the joint measurements of the weak lensing distortion and magnification bias effects on background galaxies ( umetsu et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "the map is given on @xmath75 grids for the area of @xmath76 .",
    "note that the wide - field subaru data allows us to probe the mass distribution on larger scales @xmath77 covering up to the virial radius @xmath78 ( b05a ) , thus ensuring that the acs and subaru information are independent . the pixel - pixel covariance matrix defined as @xmath79",
    "can be accurately estimated based on the maximum likelihood map - making method , assuming that the error of weak lensing distortion arises from the random intrinsic ellipticities of background galaxies , while the magnification bias error is the poissonian noise of the number counts ( @xcite ; see umetsu et al . in preparation for the details ) .",
    "the @xmath80 can be therefore expressed as @xmath81 ( v^{-1})_{ij}\\left[\\kappa^{\\rm m}(\\mathbf{r}_j)-\\kappa(\\mathbf{r}_j)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the inverse of the covariance matrix .",
    "table [ table : fit ] lists the best - fit values for the 4 model parameters of our interest as well as the virial mass derived , with the 1-@xmath2 error including the other 6 parameter uncertainties ( estimated from @xmath83 in the 7 parameter space ) .",
    "the minimum @xmath61 is @xmath84 for 362 degrees of freedom , thus showing an acceptable fit .",
    "it is clear that the halo triaxiality significantly weakens constraints on the halo concentration parameter @xmath85 , compared to the constraint @xmath8 ( @xmath86 ) derived when _ a priori _ assuming the spherical nfw model ( b05a ) .",
    "in fact , a smaller concentration compatible with the theoretical expectation @xmath87 is marginally allowed at 1-@xmath2 level .",
    "this is more clearly explored in figure [ fig : chi_tri ] , which shows the error contours in the two parameter subspace .",
    "we also show the error contours in the @xmath88 plane in figure [ fig : chi_mc ] to compare our result with figure 3 of b05a .",
    "apparently , the parameter constraints are significantly degenerate .",
    "for example , as a triaxial halo with smaller @xmath56 is considered , a broader range of the halo concentration is allowed , implying that the lensing strength is as quite sensitive to the halo triaxiality as is to the halo concentration @xmath55 . however , the axis ratios can be hardly constrained , obviously because of a lack of the halo shape information along the line - of - sight : any values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are allowed to within 3-@xmath2 level , though profiles close to spherical models ( @xmath89 ) are relatively disfavored because the subaru convergence map is not circularly symmetric .",
    "more intriguing is that the degeneracy direction in the @xmath88 plane ( figure [ fig : chi_mc ] ) is almost orthogonal to that for the spherical case ( figure 3 in b05a ) , as illustrated in figure [ fig : chi ] . as a result",
    ", the mass constraint can be reconciled with the mass estimate derived from the @xmath3-ray observation ( @xmath90 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 3-@xmath2 level",
    ". thus the halo triaxiality could resolve the mass discrepancy reported in the literature ( @xcite ; b05b ) , as we will again discuss later in more detail .    to improve the weak constraints above",
    ", we employ the prior knowledge of what kinds of halo shapes are expected for cluster - scale halos within the cdm clustering scenario .",
    "we use the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the axis ratios , which are derived in js02 using the @xmath10-body simulations .",
    "the pdfs are given as a function of redshift and halo mass ; a cluster - scale halo at @xmath91 is typically characterized by a triaxial shape with the mean value @xmath92 and the standard deviation @xmath93 . for simplicity ,",
    "we add the following gaussian prior to the @xmath61 ( eq . [ [ eqn : chi2 ] ] ) : @xmath94 , \\label{eqn : p_ac}\\ ] ] where the subscript ` ar ' stands for axis ratios and the pdfs @xmath95 and @xmath96 are given by equations ( 17 ) and ( 19 ) in js02 , respectively .",
    "the resulting constraints are shown in table [ table : fit ] and figures [ fig : chi_tri ] and [ fig : chi_mc ] .",
    "however , the constraints are only weakly tightened and the main results we have so far found are not largely changed : a broad range of the halo concentration or the virial mass is still allowed .    hence , to more highlight the constraint on the halo concentration , figure [ fig : chi_tri_ce ] shows the error contours in the @xmath97 plane , when the radius @xmath37 is fixed to @xmath98 which is consistent with observational constraints at 1-@xmath2 level .",
    "note that the other parameters are allowed to vary .",
    "the clear trend , a smaller @xmath55 is favored with decreasing @xmath56 , is apparent .",
    "this result allows a more direct comparison with the theoretical prediction , since js02 suggested that the halo concentration @xmath55 be tightly correlated with the axis ratio @xmath56 .",
    "the pdf of @xmath55 , @xmath99 , is given by equation ( 20 ) in js02 ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "the pdf is approximated with a log - normal distribution , where the mean value of @xmath55 depends on halo mass , @xmath56 and redshift ( see eq . [ 23 ] in js02 ) and the standard deviation @xmath100 . combining with the pdfs ( eq . [ [ eqn : p_ac ] ] ) for the axis ratios ,",
    "the dashed contours in figure [ fig : chi_tri_ce ] show the 1- , 2- and 3-@xmath2 probabilities for the @xmath55 and @xmath56 parameters , expected for a halo at @xmath16 , which are estimated from @xmath101 + @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , respectively , where @xmath105 $ ] ( the subscript ` ce ' stands for the concentration parameter @xmath55 ) .",
    "it is clear that the observation and theory overlap at @xmath106-@xmath2 level . to see this more quantitatively ,",
    "we compute the fraction of halos whose axis ratio @xmath56 and concentration parameter @xmath55 fall inside the contours constrained from the observation .",
    "we find that , if we take @xmath73- , @xmath107- , and @xmath108-@xmath2 limits as the observational constraints , then the fraction becomes @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , if we _ a priori _ assume the spherical halo model ( b05a ) , the fraction is significantly reduced to @xmath112 , even if we take the 3-@xmath2 limit as observational constraints .",
    "hence , we conclude that the a1689 lensing measurements are indeed compatible with the cdm - based triaxial halo model , if the a1689 represents a rare population ( @xmath113 fraction ) of cluster - scale halos ( also see the discussion in the next section ) .",
    "finally , we look at the constraints on the angle parameter @xmath58 between the major axis and the line - of - sight direction .",
    "figure [ fig : chi_theta ] shows the likelihood function against @xmath58 , derived from the observational constraints @xmath17 plus the theoretical pdfs of axis ratios and concentration parameter , @xmath114 .",
    "one can find @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) is obtained at 2-@xmath2 level .",
    "thus the major axis of the triaxial halo , when the halo has a reasonable concentration of @xmath87 , is favored to be aligned with the line - of - sight direction in order to match the a1689 steep mass profile .",
    "in this paper , we have employed the triaxial halo model of js02 to extract more reliable information on the three - dimensional mass distribution of the massive cluster a1689 , from the precise lensing measurements done based on the acs and subaru data .",
    "we have shown several important results .",
    "first , based on the simple thought experiment in  [ sec : test ] , it was demonstrated that the halo triaxiality could cause a significant bias in estimating the virial mass and concentration parameter from the lensing information , if a spherical halo model is _ a priori _ assumed for the model fitting ( see figure [ fig : chi ] ) .",
    "in particular , both the virial mass and concentration parameter are overestimated ( underestimated ) when the triaxial halo is projected along the major ( minor ) axis .",
    "second , we derived constraints on the parameters of the triaxial halo model from the fitting to the lensing measurements of a1689 , by changing all 7 parameters that specify the triaxial model ; the _ virial _ radius and concentration parameter of the triaxial modeling , two axis ratio parameters , and three angle parameters that determine the halo orientation .",
    "we have shown that the halo triaxiality significantly weakens the parameter constraints , compared to those derived when _ a priori _ assuming the spherical halo model .",
    "in addition , the parameter constraints are strongly degenerate , mainly because of a lack of the halo shape information along the line - of - sight ( see table [ table : fit ] and figures [ fig : chi_tri ] and [ fig : chi_mc ] ) . as a result , the triaxial halo model with a theoretically expected halo concentration",
    "@xmath87 is acceptable at 1-@xmath2 level , while the halo shape parameters ( axis ratios and orientation ) are hardly constrained . to further improve the model constraints",
    ", we used the theoretical predictions of probability distributions for the halo shapes , derived in js02 , as the priors to the model fitting ( see figures [ fig : chi_tri ] , [ fig : chi_mc ] , [ fig : chi_tri_ce ] and [ fig : chi_theta ] ) .",
    "most interestingly , we found that about @xmath117 population of cluster - scale halos , expected from the cdm structure formation , can match the a1689 mass profile , if the major axis is almost aligned with the line - of - sight direction .",
    "hence , although it has been shown that the triaxiality has a great impact on strong lensing probabilities @xcite , our results clearly demonstrate that the halo triaxiality is also very important for exploring the three - dimensional mass distribution of an individual cluster from the lensing measurements .",
    "it is encouraging that the triaxial halo model yields the lensing - constrained mass of a1689 consistent with the mass estimate derived from the @xmath3-ray observation at 3-@xmath2 level ( see figure [ fig : chi_mc ] ) , while the significant discrepancy of factor 2 has been reported in the literature ( @xcite ; b05b ) .",
    "we have checked that the consistent mass estimate appears when the major axis of the triaxial halo is oriented along the line - of - sight direction , as inferred from figure [ fig : chi ] .",
    "note that the @xmath3-ray mass estimate is likely to be less affected by the halo triaxiality than the lensing , as described in @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to notice that the triaxial halo elongated along the line - of - sight could resolve both the previously reported discrepancies of the high concentration as well as of the lensing and @xmath3-ray mass estimates . unfortunately , however , this hypothesis can not be further tested by the lensing information alone we have used , because the halo shape parameters ( axis ratios and orientation ) could not be well constrained .",
    "improving the halo shape constraints will allow us to make a more severe , quantitative test of the triaxial halo model , as it is clear from figure [ fig : chi_tri ] .",
    "this would be possible by combining the lensing measurements with the detailed observations of kinematics , @xmath3-ray emission and/or the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect , since projections affect the observables in different ways ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , as noted above , the mass profile reconstructed from the @xmath3-ray surface brightness profile is much less sensitive to the halo orientation , thus by comparing two - dimensional profiles from @xmath3-ray and lensing we will be able to obtain information on the degree of elongation along line - of - sight .",
    "the sz effect is also quite useful since its projection effect is complementary to that of @xmath3-ray @xcite .",
    "while our triaxial modeling is much more realistic than the simple spherical fit , there is still room for improvement .",
    "a caveat is that the pdfs of axis ratios and concentration ( js02 ) were derived for less massive clusters ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "thus it is unclear if the extrapolated predictions still hold for very massive clusters ( @xmath119 ) considered here .",
    "more importantly , the selection effect , which we have neglected in this paper , might be important .",
    "a1689 is well known as the strong - lensing cluster , with the largest einstein radius ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "strong lensing probabilities are very sensitive to shapes and orientations of dark halos such that a halo with large triaxiality , high concentration and the major axis aligned with line - of - sight has higher lensing probabilities @xcite .",
    "therefore a1689 might be indeed such a cluster , as implied in this paper . thus taking into account the selection effect",
    "could further reduce the discrepancy of a1689 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , in practice it is quite difficult to quantify the selection effect . for strong lens systems discovered in a well - defined homogeneous survey , such as the large - separation lensed quasar sdss j1004 + 4112 @xcite",
    ", it will be possible to take this selection effect into account in a correct manner .",
    "another important implication we have found is that the halo triaxiality can be a source of systematic errors in estimating the virial mass from the lensing measurement . while it has been shown that the lensing - based mass determination suffers from the projection effect due to an intervening matter , not necessarily associated with a cluster of interest @xcite ,",
    "our results imply that the halo shape itself causes a bias in the mass determination ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the accurate mass determination is crucial to achieve the full potential of future cluster cosmology experiments such as expected from planck , where the cluster redshift distribution is measured to constrain cosmological models @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is again very interesting to address how the mass determination can be improved for an individual cluster as well as in a statistical sense by combining the lensing , @xmath3-ray and sz effect measurements .",
