    "the insulating antiferromagnetic phase of layered cuprates is well described by the two - dimensional hubbard model at half filling .",
    "it is less clear whether this model is also able to describe the superconducting phase observed for hole concentrations @xmath1 .",
    "it has been shown a long time ago that fermions with purely repulsive interactions can become superconducting , but the initial estimates for the critical temperature of continum models were deceptively low @xcite . in the mean - time , both analytical and numerical studies have indicated that for electrons on a lattice the situation may not be hopeless .",
    "unfortunately , reliable estimates for the superconducting gap @xmath2 , the condensation energy @xmath3 or other important quantities for the two - dimensional repulsive hubbard model and variants thereof are still missing .    here",
    "we report on the current status of our variational studies of the two - dimensional hubbard model for intermediate values of @xmath4 and a hole doping @xmath5 .",
    "our preliminary results for the gap and the condensation energy are consistent with typical experimental values .",
    "there are two competing terms in the hubbard hamiltonian @xmath6 , the hopping term between nearest - neighbour sites    @xmath7    where @xmath8 creates an electron at site @xmath9 with spin @xmath10 , and the on - site interaction ( the number of doubly occupied sites )    @xmath11    several variational studies have been performed for the limiting case @xmath12 , where double occupancy is completely suppressed @xcite .",
    "this limit is not appropriate for intermediate values of @xmath4 .",
    "we have thus chosen the variational ansatz    @xmath13    where double occupancy is only partially suppressed ( variational parameter @xmath14 ) . at the same time both the delocalization of holes and kinetic exchange between spins",
    "are enhanced ( parameter @xmath15 ) .",
    "the parent state @xmath16 is a bcs state with parameters describing @xmath0-wave pairing , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath17",
    "with @xmath18 we notice that our wave function contains two additional variational parameters , the gap @xmath2 and the `` chemical potential '' @xmath19 ( @xmath19 is a variational parameter and not the true chemical potential ) .    the expectation value of the hamiltonian with respect to our trial state is computed using a monte carlo simulation .",
    "this is straightforward for @xmath20 , where the bcs state can be projected onto a subspace with a fixed number of particles and written as a superposition of real space configurations . for @xmath21",
    "the projection onto a state with a fixed number of particles is found to lead to minus sign problems , which worsen as the gap parameter increases .",
    "the problem can be solved by using a fixed `` chemical potential '' ( instead of a fixed number of particles ) together with a momentum space representation .",
    "a hubbard - stratonovich transformation is used to decouple the on - site interaction in the gutzwiller projector .",
    "unfortunately , this approach results in a very slow convergence .",
    "total energy per site of a 8x8 square lattice for a density corresponding to the slightly overdoped region of the phase diagram of cuprates.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]",
    "we have first considered the particular case @xmath20 , which has been studied previously @xcite .",
    "fig .   [ gutz ] shows the energy per site as a function of the gap @xmath2 for several values of @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath22 the numerical precision does not allow to draw any conclusion about pairing , but for @xmath23 and @xmath24 there are clear minima at @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "allowing @xmath15 to vary improves significantly both the energy and the wave function @xcite . for @xmath24 , the energy gain due to the refinement of the variational ansatz is two orders of magnitude larger than the condensation energy of fig .",
    "nevertheless , our first results for @xmath21 confirm the trend towards @xmath0-wave superconductivity , with a gap of about the same size as in fig .",
    "[ gutz ] .",
    "we briefly comment on the comparison between our results ( for @xmath24 , @xmath27 mev and @xmath28 ) and experimental data for the layered cuprates .",
    "typical data for the gap parameter found in photoemission experiments are @xmath29 mev @xcite , while the condensation energy obtained from specific heat data is of the order of @xmath30 mev @xcite .",
    "both experimental values agree surprisingly well with our variational results .",
