    "in a recent fast track communication @xcite we discussed the phenonemon of generalised exclusion statistics @xcite in a non - hermitian bcs model . the non - hermitian hamiltonian results from an asymmetry in the cooper pair scattering amplitudes , depending on whether the scattering is from high energy to low energy states or vice versa .",
    "as a result of being non - hermitian , the hamiltonian admits complex eigenvalues for particular choices of the coupling parameters .",
    "however as the hamiltonian is a real - valued operator non - real eigenvalues , when they occur , arise as complex conjugate pairs . in this sense",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian mirrors the property of admitting an unbroken @xmath0-symmetric phase and a broken @xmath0-symmetric phase which has been discussed in multiple other models , e.g. see articles contained within the journal of physics a special issue _ quantum physics with non - hertian operators _ @xcite .",
    "it was found from numerical diagonalisation of the asymmetric bcs hamiltonian that the transition between broken and unbroken @xmath0-symmetry occurs on two boundary lines in the phase diagram .",
    "furthermore , it was determined from the exact bethe ansatz solution of the hamiltonian that there exist free quasiparticle excitations on the boundary lines which can be characterised as satisfying generalised exclusion statistics .",
    "this finding relies on a deep understanding of the representation theory of a yangian algebra , denoted @xmath1 $ ] , from which the model may be obtained via the quantum inverse scattering method @xcite .",
    "the objective of this article is to provide a detailed exposition of these generalised exclusion statistics .    in section 2",
    "we begin by discussing the reduced bcs pairing hamiltonian in general terms .",
    "we specify the asymmetric choice of cooper pair scattering amplitudes which leads to our model of investigation . in section 3 we review some relevant aspects of the quantum inverse scattering method @xcite , and the associated techniques of the algebraic bethe ansatz for the derivation of exact solutions .",
    "this algebraic approach is essentially an application of the representation theory for the yangian algebra @xmath1 $ ] , which was developed by chari and pressley @xcite . in section 4",
    "we illustrate how excitations obeying generalised exclusion statistics are identified in terms of dividing the solutions of the bethe ansatz equations into two classes .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of generalised exclusuion statistics in an exactly solved model studied by fendley and schoutens @xcite , and provides an example of deconfined quantum criticality @xcite . in part",
    "our analysis amounts to addressing an old question regarding the completeness of the bethe ansatz solution discussed in bethe s original work for the @xmath2 chain @xcite , and more recently debated in @xcite .",
    "we conjecture a formula for counting the number of deconfined states , and prove its validity in some limiting cases .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section 5 .",
    "two appendices are included . the first tables some complete , analytic solutions of the bethe ansatz equations associated with low - dimensional hilbert spaces of states .",
    "the second describes a mean - field analysis of the hamiltonian which predicts that the hamiltonian always has a real eigenspectrum .",
    "these latter calculations highlight the need for exact results to accurately characterise the system .",
    "the general form for a reduced bcs hamiltonian as originally discussed in @xcite is given by @xmath3 here , @xmath4 labels a shell of doubly degenerate single particle energy levels with energies @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the fermion number operator for level @xmath7 .",
    "the operators @xmath8 are the annihilation and creation operators for fermions at level @xmath7 .",
    "the labels @xmath9 refer to pairs of time - reversed states .",
    "an important feature of the hamiltonian ( [ bcs_eqn ] ) is the blocking effect . for any unpaired fermion at level @xmath7",
    "the action of the pairing interaction is zero since only paired fermions are scattered .",
    "this means that basis states for the hilbert space can be decoupled into products of paired and unpaired fermion states in which the action of the hamiltonian on the space for the unpaired fermions is automatically diagonal in the basis of number operator eigenstates . in view of this property the pair number operator @xmath10 commutes with ( [ bcs_eqn ] ) and",
    "thus provides a good quantum number .",
    "below , @xmath11 will be used to denote the eigenvalues of the pair number operator .",
    "[ fig : subfigures ]     +    below we will instead consider the case for which @xmath17 and @xmath18 are both real - valued .",
    "although this does not lead to a hermitian hamiltonian , nonetheless the spectrum is real - valued in some region of the coupling paramater space . throughout",
    "we will work with a _ picket fence _",
    "model whereby the @xmath5 are uniformly and symmetrically distributed around zero . in particular",
    "we write @xmath20 where the level spacing @xmath21 provides an energy scale for the system . through numerical diagonalisation of the hamiltonian",
    "it is found that there are clearly identifiable regions where the spectrum is real .",
    "illustrative cases are depicted in fig .",
    "it is evident that the boundary lines separating real - valued and complex - valued spectra are approximately @xmath22 for sufficiently large @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "on the lines of the coupling parameter space given by ( [ lines ] ) we will describe a class of free quasi - particle excitations exhibiting generalised exclusion statistics .",
    "our analysis hereafter will be conducted using exact results . in order to present the exact bethe ansatz solution for the hamiltonian it is useful to make a change of variable .",

    "the dimension of the hilbert space is @xmath110 .",
    "the first important observation to make from the previous subsection is that when @xmath107 the roots of the bethe equations can be clearly demarcated into two groups , those which are @xmath24-independent and those which are not .",

    "the excitations have the character of two free quasi - particles .",

    "specifically , choosing @xmath112 leads us to consider @xmath113 with @xmath114 and the associated drinfeld polynomial @xmath115 such that ( [ hw ] ) holds . for this drinfeld polynomial",
    "we find that the set of @xmath24-independent roots for the bethe ansatz equations ( [ bae3 ] ) , from which we can choose @xmath116 , is the restricted set @xmath117 here we observe the manifestation of generalised exclusion statistics .",
    "having first chosen the bethe root @xmath112 we find that not only can we not choose it again ( as is the case for the familiar fermionic exclusion principle ) , we also can not choose the `` neighbouring '' roots @xmath118 .",
    "bearing this in mind , a simple counting argument shows that the number of eigenstates in the @xmath90 sector where both roots are @xmath24-independent is given by @xmath119 .      choosing @xmath120 the bethe ansatz equation for @xmath121 is the quadratic equation @xmath122 the solution reads @xmath123 where @xmath124    while there are generally two solutions for @xmath116 , two special cases need to be re - examined in closer detail .",
