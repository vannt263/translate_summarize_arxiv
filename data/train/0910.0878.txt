    "in this paper , we model the diffuse field structure of astrophysical hii regions .",
    "recombinations within these regions emit radiation in the various hydrogen line spectra and balmer and higher continua which is an observed characteristic of them .",
    "emission in the lyman continuum , however , is energetic enough to ionize other hydrogen atoms , and so is trapped within the nebula .",
    "this radiation field is believed to have a significant fraction of the energy density of the direct ionizing continuum in some parts of the hii region , and so it is important to model it correctly .",
    "this is particularly relevant when modelling the complex dynamics of the nebulae , or the emission from the internal features such as the tails of cometary globules in the helix planetary nebula @xcite .",
    "@xcite has suggested that diffuse fields may be particularly important at the edges of hii regions , in some regimes .",
    "this would seem to suggest that the diffuse field may have a more significant impact on their overall evolution than previously assumed .",
    "however , ritzerveld uses a simple outward - only treatment of the diffuse radiation transport , and also assumes that the absorption coefficient is comparable for diffuse and direct radiation fields , although it is acknowledged that in reality the direct photons are likely to have a harder spectrum and will thus be significantly more penetrating .    to investigate the validity of these conclusions ,",
    "in this paper we apply detailed discrete - ordinate angular integration to investigate the validity of several approximate numerical transport schemes . to simplify the problem",
    ", we assume a pure - hydrogen nebula , without dust , and use a simple two - frequency approximation to the radiation flow .    with our more detailed modelling , we find that the diffuse field can indeed dominate for the situations ritzerveld describes",
    ". however , where the diffuse field dominates , it will typically also be outwardly - beamed and therefore be indistinguishable from the direct field for most purposes . for most astrophysically relevant conditions ,",
    "the usual on - the - spot approximation is shown to give accurate results through most of a spherical nebula , except for a region close to the star where it _ overestimates _ the diffuse field .",
    "we also assess the accuracy of the eddington diffusion approximation for the diffuse field transfer , which may be a useful means of modelling diffuse transport effects in multidimensional simulations .",
    "in the present paper , we neglect the effects of dust and heavy elements in the hii region .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for the case of cosmological hii regions ; however , there is observational evidence for the importance of dust absorption within the ionized gas in galactic hii regions @xcite .",
    "we briefly discuss the impact dust might have on our results .",
    "we use a simple model of hii regions to study the diffuse field structure .",
    "we consider steady , spherically symmetric pure - hydrogen regions , with the radiation field in two frequency components : higher frequency radiation propagating directly from a central point source , and lower frequency diffuse radiation .",
    "we assume that the material within the hii region is maintained at a constant temperature in ionization equilibrium .    in the absence of dust ,",
    "the governing equations are then @xmath0 corresponding to the transfer of direct radiation from a point source , @xmath1 , the diffuse radiation field @xmath2 , and balance of ionization and recombination for ionization fraction @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the specific luminosity and @xmath5 the radiation intensity specified in terms of the _ number _ of photons , rather than the radiation energy , as this is more natural in the present application .    integrating equations  ( [ e : dir])([e : ion ] ) over volume , and angle where appropriate , and applying the boundary conditions @xmath6 at @xmath7 , @xmath8 as @xmath9",
    ", we find that @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "this has a simple interpretation , in that the number of ionizing photons into the nebula balances the number of recombinations which destroy such photons ( rather than re - emitting a lyman continuum photon ) .    if the ionization front is thin , as is typically the case , then a characteristic strmgren radius for a spherical hii region , @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13 independent of diffuse radiation transport effects .    from @xcite , we take values of the recombination coefficients at @xmath14 of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the ionization cross section for the diffuse radiation is the lyman limit cross section @xmath17 , while for the direct photons , we take either @xmath18 ( which allows for the largest likely effect of the higher average frequency of the direct photons ) or @xmath19 ( corresponding to the case which was primarily considered by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in practice",
    ", the effective absorption coefficients will depend on the spectrum of the star and the recombination continuum , and their modification due to intervening absorption processes : the uncertainty is enhanced by the sharp dependence of the absorption cross section on the photon frequency above threshold ( see figure 2.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "the calculations are normalized to a star emitting ionizing photons at a rate @xmath20 , generating an equilibrium strmgren sphere of radius @xmath21 in all cases .",
    "this corresponds to a density of @xmath22 for the uniform density case .",
    "for direct comparison to ritzerveld s work , we consider three main density distributions : uniform , and proportional to @xmath23 or @xmath24 beyond an empty core of radius @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the simplest approximation widely used in astrophysics is the case b approximation . here , the diffuse field is assumed to be absorbed at the same point as it is emitted , so equation  ( [ e : dif ] ) is replaced by the on - the - spot ( ots ) approximation @xmath27 note that the diffuse radiation intensity is isotropic in this approximation . with this assumption ,",
    "equation  ( [ e : ion ] ) simplifies to @xmath28 and so @xmath29 since the hydrogen ionization fraction is close to unity through most of an astrophysical hii region , this equation may then be integrated to define the strmgren radius , in agreement with equation  ( [ e : rstrom ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the diffuse field photon density to that of the ionizing field is @xmath30 which is roughly @xmath31 per cent for equal absorption cross sections , or @xmath32 per cent if we assume a lower absorption cross section for direct photons .",
    "the ratio of the diffuse flux through a surface ( of any orientation ) to the direct flux through a surface directed towards the star will be one quarter of this value ( as in the analysis of * ? ? ? * who assume @xmath33 , and thus find @xmath34 ) .",
    "if we wish to extend this analysis , we need to obtain a better estimate for @xmath35 to insert in equation  ( [ e : ion ] ) .",
    "writing equation  ( [ e : dif ] ) as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the opacity and @xmath38 is the volume emissivity , then we can write @xmath39 this exact expression remains dependent on @xmath40 .",
    "if we apply the on - the - spot approximation @xmath41 to truncate the hierarchy at this approximation , the integration over angle is zero , which shows that the case b approximation is accurate to second order .    to obtain more accurate results , however , we can substitute for @xmath40 again using equation  ( [ e : gentran ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath42 again , the second term in the integral will be zero . assuming the remaining @xmath40 term is also isotropic to first order , it will be a function of radius alone , so @xmath43 and so @xmath44 corresponding to eddington approximation @xmath45 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus given a distribution of ionization , we can solve for the diffuse field using this expression , in which the diffusive transport corrects the ots intensity .",
    "note , that since @xmath46 in the centre of the hii region , the free path @xmath47 may be large .",
    "@xcite solves an outward - only system @xmath48 where for slab symmetry @xmath49 , @xmath50 , for cylindrical symmetry @xmath51 , @xmath52 and for spherical symmetry @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "note that these equations are given here for the total ionization intensity integrated over the surface at the specified radius .",
    "ritzerveld states that they apply to the density of photons per unit volume , but this is clearly not the case , as if all the recombination coefficients are zero , then @xmath55 .",
    "this system approximates the transport in the limit of nearly complete ionization within the hii region .",
    "the factor @xmath56 allows for the preferential absorption of the diffuse photons .",
    "the results presented by @xcite can be generalized to the case of arbitrary ratios of absorption cross section .",
    "adding equations ( [ e : ritzerdir ] ) and ( [ e : ritzerdif ] ) , we find @xmath57 and hence @xmath58    a general ( implicit ) expression for the direct and diffuse fields can be derived in terms of the total field , independent of the density distribution or geometry . dividing equation  ( [ e : ritzersum ] ) by equation  ( [ e : ritzerdir ] ) , we find @xmath59 and hence @xmath60.\\label{e : gendirect}\\ ] ] given @xmath61 from equation  ( [ e : itot ] ) above , equation  ( [ e : gendirect ] )",
    "may then be solved for @xmath1 ( explicitly in the case @xmath62 , to recover the analytic solutions which ritzerveld presents ) , and then @xmath63 .",
    "we use an iterative technique to find solutions , using similar techniques to those applied elsewhere @xcite . here",
    ", we integrate the diffuse field using a large number of coaxial zones .",
    "we first derive an approximate ionization structure using the case b approximation , and use this to estimate the outward - going diffuse field components .",
    "we integrate the diffuse field transport inwards through this structure . as part of this sweep , we calculate an improved estimate for the ionization structure taking account of the new inward radiation field beams .",
    "we then integrate the direct radiation and outward - going diffuse field outward through the resulting structure , using the inward diffuse field at its closest point to the star as the initial condition for the outward beams , updating the ionization structure again .",
    "we iterate these inward and outward sweeps until the ionization structure has converged  this convergence is rapid in practice .",
    "the results for the ionization structure are very sensitive to the details of the numerical scheme for the case where the density varies as @xmath24 , in particular the strmgren radius can vary significantly . as noted by @xcite , the ionization front can in this case escape to infinity : having the ionization front at 20 times the inner radius of the density distribution requires a rather precisely tuned value of the incident radiation field .",
    "this feeds through to the numerical sensitivity .    as a result of this ,",
    "considerable care has to be taken in the radiation field integration to ensure the rate at which photons are removed from the radiation field is consistent with the ionization rate within the zone @xcite . to do this",
    ", we will adapt the approach described by @xcite to the case of multiple incident beams of radiation and diffuse sources .",
    "we specify the radiation field in coaxial cylindrical zones , which intersect spherical shells within which the physical variables are assumed to be uniform .",
    "we take the @xmath64-th component of the density field to occupy a spherical shell of outer radius @xmath65 , and the @xmath66-th group of diffuse photons to be those with an impact parameter between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "integrating equation  ( [ e : ion ] ) over a spatial zone , we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 substituting from the transport equations , ( [ e : dir ] ) and  ( [ e : dif ] ) , then gives @xmath72_{r_{i-1}}^{r_i}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad -\\int_{r_{i-1}}^{r_i } \\int { di_{\\rm dif}\\over ds } \\,d\\omega ' 4\\pi r^2 \\,dr , \\label{e : disceqm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the problem is uniform in space , so the angular integral over the zone volume is trivial . combining the spatial integral @xmath73 with the beam solid angle integral @xmath74 , however , yields an integral which may be taken as over the zone volume for beams which are incident from a single direction .",
    "this may be discretized as the difference in diffuse flux within each radiation bin across the zone , @xmath75 where the integral may now be approximated as the change in the diffuse flux within the cylinder @xmath76 as the photons pass across the radial zone .",
    "again , this has the interpretation that the difference between ionizing photons into and out of the zone is balanced with the rate of recombinations in the zone which destroy such photons .    in order to evaluate the differences in the direct and diffuse fluxes on either side of the zone",
    ", we discretize the transport equations .",
    "there are a range of choices for this discretization , which give different forms for the equations to be solved to evaluate the ionization fraction @xcite .",
    "as the source function from the recombinations means that there is no simple closed form solution to the ionization equilibrium problem in the zone , we instead choose a scheme where the outgoing beams are guaranteed to be positive .",
    "we integrate the transfer equation  ( [ e : dif ] ) across a uniform zone to give @xmath77+\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad s_{\\rm dif}(x)\\left(1-\\exp\\left[-na_1(1-x)\\delta s\\right]\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the diffuse field source function .",
    "the change in ionizing flux across the zone required for the ionization balance equation in the form  ( [ e : disceqm ] ) is then @xmath79\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\left(1-\\exp\\left[-n(1-x)a_1\\delta s\\right]\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression must then be integrated over the cylindrical zone of impact parameters and the solid angle of photon directions to obtain a finite difference in the form needed to be used in equation  ( [ e : disceqm ] ) . on the right hand side",
    ", we make the first - order assumption that a single mean path length applies to all photons within the photon zone as they cross the radial zone .    in order to perform the discrete integrals",
    ", we need to determine the volume of intersection between the radiation and spatial zones .",
    "the volume between these cylindrical and spherical shells , each of thickness @xmath80 , is contained in two disjoint components , apart from the case @xmath81 .",
    "the radiation field in the latter case can still be advanced by the same formalism by splitting the zone in two at the intersection of the radiation beam with the equatorial plane .",
    "note , however , that the additional radiation flux values introduced into the diffuse field arrays as a result must not be included when calculating radiation field moments at the radial zone interfaces .",
    "each component has volume @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the volume within a coaxial sphere of radius @xmath84 but outside a cylinder of radius @xmath85 , @xmath86 the area of the cylindrical shell is @xmath87 hence the average path length of photons within the cylindrical shell @xmath66 through one of the the intersections with the spherical shell is @xmath88 we use these distances as the chord lengths for propagation of the diffuse radiation propagation in the cylindrical shell labelled @xmath66 through its intersection with the spherical shell labelled @xmath64 in the ionization equilibrium solution , in order to obtain volume consistency .",
    "the resulting expression for the zone ionization , including all direct and diffuse beams , is solved using newton - raphson iteration .    in all cases",
    ", we verify that at convergence the number of case b recombinations within the modelled hii region balances the incoming ionizing flux to high accuracy .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in figure  [ f : accuracy ] , we compare the accuracy of a diffusion approximation solution to the diffuse field intensity to that of the on - the - spot approximation .",
    "the diffusion results are almost everywhere more accurate than the ots approximation , being in error by less than 30 per cent even in the most difficult , central region of the flow .",
    "both schemes are accurate at the edge of the nebula , where the most interesting dynamical structures occur , although the diffusion results are still significantly more precise .",
    "a diffusion approximation solver could be embedded in a dynamical code by updating the ionization solution consistently with the sources derived from the diffusion solver and iterating , in a similar fashion to that which we use for the full field transfer .",
    "experimenting with updating the ionization structure after both inward and outward transfer are complete suggests that the solution converges more slowly than if the ionization structure is updated on each sweep .",
    "however , in the context of a dynamical scheme , the initial approximation for the ionization structure will have come from the previous timestep , and hence would be expected to not be far from the correct solution .",
    "the diffusion approximation allows processes such as the lateral illumination of the tails of photoionized globules to be modelled @xcite .",
    "however , the lateral illumination of shadowed tails may be overstimated in cases where the beaming of the diffuse field is expected to be strong @xcite : eddington tensor approaches ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may improve the results in such limits .",
    ") for power - law density indexes @xmath89 ( solid ) , @xmath90 ( dashed ) , @xmath91 ( dot - dashed ) .",
    "this function shows where the ots approximation for the diffuse field is expected to be accurate ( roughly for radii where the ordinate is less than @xmath92).,width=226 ]    the accuracy of the ots approximation may be evaluated by comparing the scale of variation of the diffuse field source function , @xmath93 , to the mean free path for diffuse photons , @xmath94 .    using equation  ( [ e : sdif ] ) for the source function , and the ots approximation equation  ( [ e : casebbalance ] ) for the ionization balance @xmath95 note that we can still use the ots approximation to close our equations at this higher order .",
    "the source function varies radially , so that @xmath96 where we have used equation  ( [ e : ldirots ] ) .",
    "now through most of the hii region , @xmath46 , and hence @xmath97 and so @xmath98 where the integral is the result of equation  ( [ e : ldirots ] ) . for a density distribution @xmath99 outside some specific radius , @xmath100 (",
    "so long as @xmath101 ) . in figure",
    "[ f : otsacc ] we show the form of the r.h.s . of equation  ( [ e : otsacc ] ) for @xmath33 .",
    "this suggests that ots approximation will be most accurate close to the outer edge of hii regions .",
    "when @xmath33 , the ots approximation for the diffuse field is only marginally valid at any point in the nebula . for @xmath102 , the ots approximation may be valid for a larger region at the outside of the nebula .",
    "this is in accord with the results we have already seen in figure  [ f : radang ] ; equation  ( [ e : otsacc ] ) is a simple formula which allows the accuracy to be assessed for a variety of hii region structures .    in conclusion ,",
    "while the ots approximation gives accurate results for the ionization structure in the hii region , as we have seen in figure  [ f : ionize ] , the form of the diffuse field opacity @xmath103 emphasizes differences in the interior of the region , where @xmath46 .",
    "hence , as demonstrated for certain hii region structures in figure  [ f : radang ] and confirmed in general by the analysis in this section , the ots approximation will give poor results for the diffuse radiation field , particularly when @xmath104 .",
    "as has been mentioned , there is some observational evidence for dust absorption in well - observed hii regions .",
    "the effect of such dust absorption on nebular structure and emission has been widely studied , recently by @xcite .",
    "dust absorption will act to further limit the importance of the diffuse field .",
    "this is true independent of the relative dust absorption cross section at different frequencies , since the absorption of direct photons reduces the net source of diffuse photons .    to obtain a more accurate estimate of the effects of dust ,",
    "we assume a dust cross - section in euv of @xmath105 per nucleon , with albedo @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "the dust scattering function is primarily forward - beamed , so in the present analysis we will ignore the dust - scattered continuum and take the effective absorption cross - section to be @xmath107 .",
    "if we consider the ots approximation , then for the diffuse field @xmath108 we also have photoionization equilibrium , for which equation  ( [ e : ion ] ) still holds .",
    "substituting the ots approximation  ( [ e : dustots ] ) into equation  ( [ e : ion ] ) , we find @xmath109},\\ ] ] where @xmath110 .",
    "rearranging , using @xmath111 , gives @xmath112 since in the presence of dust @xmath113 , the dust absorption will always act to reduce the diffuse field , and will be significant effect only where @xmath114 , i.e. @xmath115 . for a uniform nebula in the case b approximation , @xmath116 so , if there is a sufficient dust optical depth , the effects of dust will be most significant close to the core of an hii region .",
    "we present detailed calculations of radiation transfer within a photoionized nebula , for a simplified physical model . we find that the diffuse field is indeed enhanced in the outer parts of such a nebula if there are steep density gradients in the hii region , particularly if the absorption cross section for diffuse and direct photons is comparable .",
    "these circumstances are not likely to be typical .",
    "we also find that when the diffuse radiation is relatively strong , it is also strongly beamed in the radial direction , and so the dynamical effect of the radiation field will in any case be similar to the direct illumination .",
    "we discuss the possibility of using a diffusion approximation for the diffuse radiation field in two- and three - dimensional radiation hydrodynamic calculations of hii regions .",
    "this may allow the diffuse field effects to be calculated to reasonable accuracy without requiring a full radiation transfer calculation .",
    "this paper has not considered in detail a number of additional processes which may effect the radiation field within the nebulae , such as the spectral hardening of radiation close to the ionization front , dust absorption and scattering , and the effects of helium and other heavy elements .",
    "this is left for future work .",
