    "still unidentified , diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) are believed to be the result of the absorption of starlight by complex molecules or small dust particles in the interstellar medium .",
    "the weak absorption features have been well documented by early spectroscopists although it was not until the 1930s that the interstellar nature of the lines was recognised by merrill ( 1934 ) and coworkers .",
    "continuing investigations showed that the strength of the interstellar absorption features increased with the star s distance and degree of interstellar reddening ( merrill , 1936 ) .",
    "hence the measurement of the strength of the dibs is related to path length through the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "more recently it has become clear that the strength of the dibs correlate with the column density of hi , but not with the h@xmath3 column ( herbig 1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "although the line strengths of individual dibs correlate relatively well with the foreground reddening in cases where the diffuse ism is the main contributor to the extinction , there are particular classes of sightline where this correlation breaks down .",
    "for example , for lines of sight through circumstellar material the dib - derived colour excesses ( _ e(b  v ) _ ) turn out to be smaller than the total _ e(b ",
    "v ) _  determined by other means ( e.g. snow & wallerstein , 1972 ; le bertre & lequeux , 1993 on mass - losing objects ; porceddu , benvenuti & krelowski 1992 , on be stars ) .",
    "a similar effect has been found for sightlines into star - forming regions , with the further complication that not all dibs suffer the same reduction ( e.g. meyer & ulrich 1984 , who studied t tau objects ; adamson et al .",
    "1991 , taurus dark clouds ; jenniskens , ehrenfreund & foing 1994 , orion ) .",
    "these findings suggest that the physical conditions in these media are such that the carriers responsible for the dib absorption do not exist in the same relative quantities as in the diffuse ism , which is probably related to the formation , excitation and destruction of different dib carriers . the concept of different dib ` families ' ( krelowski & walker , 1987 ) can be traced back to this concept .",
    "some band strengths are well correlated with each other , but not with the reddening , while other bands correlate strongly with reddening .    in the present study",
    "we describe the behaviour of the dibs in the lines of sight towards massive young stellar objects .",
    "our targets are the optically visible young stellar object ( yso ) mwc 349a and four herbig be stars , objects which are optically bright enough to obtain high signal - to - noise spectra at intermediate dispersion in the optical .",
    "the herbig  ae / be@xmath4  stars are widely believed to be associated with circumstellar envelopes of dust .",
    "the material in the line of sight towards these young massive objects is thus a combination of ` normal ' intervening diffuse interstellar material , possibly cold material in the clouds in which the objects have formed , and certainly warm circumstellar material .",
    "it is hard to estimate the relative contributions to the total extinction of these media , but observations of the dibs can in the long run help to elucidate this problem .    here",
    ", we investigate whether the dibs in the spectra of our targets would imply the same extinction as that derived by other means .",
    "any difference between the derived _ e(b ",
    "v ) _  values would set an upper limit to the contribution of diffuse material to the line - of - sight extinction . in the following",
    "we will derive _ e(b",
    " v ) _  by comparing the observed slopes in the target spectra with standard star spectra - a ` continuum method ' , and derive _ e(b ",
    "v ) _  from the dib strengths alone using published relations between the ew of dibs and _ e(b ",
    "v)_.    the lay - out of this paper is as follows : in sec.[obs ] we describe the observations and data reduction . in sec .",
    "[ ebv ] the determination of the continuum reddening towards the targets is presented and compared with values in the literature . in sec .",
    "[ dibs ] the measurement and analysis of the dibs in the spectra are presented .",
    "we then compare the dib derived _",
    "v ) _  with statistical estimates of the colour excess attributable to the foreground ism described in sec .",
    "[ foreg ] .",
    "the paper ends with a summary .",
    "in the course of our study of the optical spectra of massive ysos ( e.g. drew et al .",
    "1997 ) we obtained observations on the nights of the 20th to the 22nd june 1994 with the william herschel telescope ( wht ) at the la palma observatory .",
    "the weather throughout the run was good , yielding a seeing of 0.7 to 1 arcsec .",
    "the twin - beam intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( isis ) was used with the r1200b and r1200r gratings on the blue and red arms of the instrument .",
    "the blue detector was a 1124 @xmath5 1124 pixel tek1 chip , the red detector was a 1180 @xmath5 1280 eev6 chip .",
    "the wavelength ranges covered were 38605190  in the blue arm with a small gap of 120between 42704390  .",
    "the red arm covered the wavelength range 58408390 .",
    "the dichroic crossed over at 5400 .",
    "the instrumental set - up does not allow for the observation of the well - known dibs at 5780 and 5797 @xmath6 .",
    "however , the large wavelength coverage and high sensitivity of the observations make up for this loss . for wavelength calibration a copper - neon - argon lamp",
    "was observed at frequent intervals .",
    "the projected entrance slit width was 1 arcsec , which resulted in spectral resolution elements of 0.8(@xmath7/@xmath8 @xmath9 8200 at h@xmath10 ) , as determined from arc line profile fits .",
    "to minimise cosmic ray events in the spectra , exposure times were limited to 1800s .",
    "the observations included a spread of spectral type standards which are listed in table  [ tab : spectypes ] .",
    "the typical integration times for these bright stars were of order minutes per setting , resulting in snr ratios in the continuum of more than 100 .",
    "table  [ tab : objects ] lists the ysos observed . at each wavelength setting the spectral coverage obtained",
    "was generally a few angstroms in excess of 400 .",

    "now that the total _ e(b  v ) _  and the _",
    "e(b  v ) _  traced by the dibs are derived , it is of interest to have an independent estimate of the extinction due only to the foreground diffuse interstellar medium along our sightlines .",
    "this is done by investigating the reddening of nearby field stars .    to facilitate this ,",
    "we have searched the polarization catalogue compiled by matthewson et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , which contains , in combination with polarization data , values for the extinction and photometric distances of more than 7500 objects . for each of our stars , we selected all objects within a radius of 400 arcmin .",
    "the results of this exercise are set out in fig .",
    "[ fore ] , where the _",
    "e(b  v ) _  for each star is plotted against its distance modulus _",
    "m_. a consistency check was made by a comparison with similar relations presented by fitzgerald ( 1968 ) and neckel & klare ( 1980 ) , and by calculating the _ e(b  v ) _  and",

    "( using @xmath12= 3.1 ) listed by schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) for randomly selected objects .",
    "this showed that the listed _",
    "e(b  v ) _  and _ m  m _ in the matthewson et al .  ( 1978 ) catalogue are in general correct to within 0.2 and 0.5 magnitudes respectively .    in the figure ,",

    " v)_. the lines of sight to bd+40@xmath14124 , mwc 349a and mwc 1080 initially show a trend between the distance modulus and _ e(b  v ) _ , which then breaks down at large distances , where the objects are scattered in _",
    "v)_. since all these objects are located in , or near , molecular clouds the scatter is real , and reflects the many stars at different depths and locations within patchy clouds . where feasible ,",
    "a conservative upper bound to the foreground reddening in the lines of sight is indicated by the solid lines .",
    "it is not ruled out that the sightlines to mwc 297 and hd 200775 show a similar behaviour to that seen in e.g. mwc 349a , but the sparse number of data points makes it hard to recognize this .",
    "for example , mwc 297 is known to be located within the aquila rift at a distance of about 250 pc ( dame & thaddeus , 1985 , drew et al",
    ". however , one may see that it is only beyond @xmath9500 parsec ( _ m  m _ @xmath9 8.5 ) that the data points scatter in a similar way as for mwc 349a .",
    "these stars must be behind the aquila rift .",
    "it would appear that the catalogue of matthewson et al .",
    "includes too few stars that are located in the rift at _ m ",
    "@xmath9 6 - 7 .",
    "similarly , it seems in the figure for hd 200775 ( positioned within ngc 7023 ) that _",
    "v ) _  only starts to become significant beyond _ m  m _ @xmath9 6 .",
    "it is clear that in all cases the foreground extinction is much less than the total extinction towards the objects ( fig .",
    "[ fore ] , table  [ simple ] ) . for the _",
    "e(b  v ) _  traced by the dibs some interesting differences appear . for both mwc 297 and hd 200775 the foreground extinction may be comparable with the _",
    "e(b  v ) _  as calculated from the dibs , but not larger . in the other cases , the dib- _ e(b ",
    "v ) _  is intermediate between the total _ e(b ",
    "v ) _  and the foreground extinction .",
    "this suggests that the molecular clouds , or even the circumstellar material , harbour conditions in which the dib carriers can be present albeit at reduced abundance .",
    "we remind however that there is a small collection of dibs in the spectrum of mwc 297 that is particularly strong ; namely @xmath75849 , @xmath74963 and @xmath74726 appear to trace the total continuum _",
    "dib features are in general well - correlated with the interstellar extinction for field objects , but deviate in instances where circumstellar or parental cloud material is present .",
    "the results in table  [ simple ] and in the previous section certainly indicate that the latter is true for our sample of massive ysos as well .",
    "the diffuse ism contributes only a fraction of the total reddening towards the ysos  the rest of the extinction being due to either cloud or circumstellar material .      1 .    from our crude estimates of the foreground extinction",
    "we find that a large fraction of the extinction to these stars is not provided by the diffuse interstellar medium , but by circumstellar material or dust within the parental cloud",
    ". 2 .    by and large ,",
    "the dib- _ e(b ",
    "v ) _  is smaller than the total _ e(b ",
    "v ) _  towards the optically visible massive ysos - but is mostly larger than the expected foreground reddening .",
    "this means that at least a fraction of the dibs are formed within the molecular clouds , but less efficiently than in the normal diffuse ism .",
    "this implies that conditions in this material are such that dib excitation is weaker or that the dib carriers are less efficiently formed or more prone to destruction .",
    "the dibs trace most of the _ e(b",
    " v ) _  suffered by bd+40@xmath14124  but very little in the line of sight to mwc 297 .",
    "such variations in ` efficiency ' clearly imply that the conditions vary strongly from one cloud of massive star formation to the other .",
    "if the dibs are due to different types of carrier , the strength of the lines will be proportional to the respective column densities of the carriers .",
    "the effective normalization of line - strengths to _ e(b  v ) _  for ` normal ' diffuse interstellar material then gives us a handle on their relative abundances . from the fact that the @xmath75849 line seems to trace the total _ e(b ",
    "v ) _ , one may infer that the carrier of this line is more readily formed or less likely to be destroyed , in star - forming clouds than other lines .",
    "the same may also be true for the @xmath74726 and @xmath74963 dibs as strikingly illustrated by the case of mwc 297 .",
