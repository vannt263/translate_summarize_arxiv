    "the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite has promoted the search for new types of matter that can behave like a cosmological constant @xcite by combining positive energy density and negative pressure .",

    "this type of matter is known as _",
    "chaplygin gas_. in doing so the authors considered mainly a spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic universe described by a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric .",
    "the theoretical arguments and recent experimental data , which support the existence of an anisotropic phase that approaches an isotropic one , lead to consider the models of universe with anisotropic back - ground . since the modern - day universe is almost isotropic at large , its simplicity and evolution into a frw universe makes the bi universe a prime candidate for studying the possible effects of an anisotropy in the early universe on present - day observations . in a number of papers , e.g. , @xcite , we have studied the role of a nonlinear spinor and/or a scalar fields in the formation of an anisotropic universe free from initial singularity .",
    "it was shown that for a suitable choice of nonlinearity and the sign of @xmath2 term the model in question allows regular solutions and the universe becomes isotropic in the process of evolution .",

    "the author studied a self - consistent system of bianchi type - i ( bi ) gravitational field and a binary mixture of perfect fluid and dark energy given by a cosmological constant .",
    "the perfect fluid in that paper was chosen to be the one obeying either the usual equation of state , i.e. , @xmath0 , with @xmath1 $ ] or a van der waals equation of state . that paper was followed by another where we studied the evolution of an initially anisotropic universe given by a bi spacetime and a bimnary mixture of a perfect fluid obeying the equation of state @xmath0 and a dark energy given by either a quintessence or a chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the inclusion of dark energy does not eliminate initial singularity of the model and the space - time in those cases is ever - expanding . in order to obtain a singularity - free universe in the present paper",
    "we introduce a modified version of quintessence - like dark energy , which at the same time is able to explain the accelerated expansion .",

    "we also use the notations @xmath40 and @xmath41 to denote the energy density and the pressure of the perfect fluid , respectively .    in a comoving frame",
    "the conservation law of the energy momentum tensor leads to the balance equation for the energy density @xmath42 the dark energy is supposed to interact with itself only and it is minimally coupled to the gravitational field . as a result the evolution equation for the energy density decouples from that of the perfect fluid , and from eq .",
    "we obtain two balance equations    [ balance ] @xmath43      in order to complete the system of equations we need to specify two equations of state for @xmath41 and @xmath39 .",

    "it was mentioned earlier that the dark energy can be given by a @xmath2 term , a quintessence or a chaplygin gas .",

    "we introduce a modified model of quintessence when the dark energy and the corresponding pressure obeys the following equation of state : @xmath59 where the constant @xmath60 .",
    "here @xmath61 some critical energy density .",
    "setting @xmath62 one obtains ordinary quintessence .",
    "it is well known that as the universe expands the ( dark ) energy density decreases . as a result ,",
    "being a linear negative function of energy density , the corresponding pressure begins to increase . in case of an ordinary quintessence",
    "the pressure is always negative , but for a modified quintessence as soon as @xmath63 becomes less than the critical one , the pressure becomes positive . in fig .",

    "as one sees , the positivity of the radical imposes some restriction on the maximum value of @xmath18 , i.e. , in this case the model allows oscillatory mode of expansion .",
    "it means the dark energy initially acts as a repulsive force resulting in accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "but as soon as @xmath68 becomes less than @xmath61 the corresponding pressure changes its direction and as a result the universe begins to contract . in order to give a complete picture , beside the system with a modified quintessence we study the system with an ordinary one as well",

    "it should be emphasized that the initially anisotropic universe in this case evolves into an isotropic frw one .",
    "as oppose to the ordinary quintessence a modified quintessence imposes some restriction on the maximum value of @xmath18 . as a result",
    "the universe initially expands , but after reaching some maximum it begins to contract . depending on the choice of the constant , which can be viewed as an energy level , it either shrinks into a point [ cf .",
    "[ taunonpc1 ] ] thus giving rise to space - time singularity , or begins to expand again after reaching some non - zero minimum , i.e. , the universe in this case experiences the oscillatory mode of expansion [ cf . fig .",

    "[ edpr ] we illustrate the evolution of energy density and pressure when the universe is filled with a binary mixture of perfect fluid given by a radiation and a modified quintessence .",
    "as one sees , the initial density is large enough and the pressure is initially negative , with the energy density being less than @xmath61 , pressure becomes positive and the universe begins to contract . as a result the energy density begins to increase and pressure again becomes negative .",
    "this results in the oscillatory mode of expansion .    finally in fig .",
    "[ acceleration ] we plot the graphic of acceleration verses time .",
    "as one sees , if the universe is filled with perfect fluid only , the process of evolution decelerates with time , while the inclusion of an ordinary quintessence results in an accelerated evolution .",
