    "when drawing up genetic trees of languages , it is sometimes useful to quantify the degree of relationship between them .",
    "mathematical approaches along these lines have been pursued for some time now  is an excellent review of some important techniques .",
    ", in fact , attempts to address the issue central to this paper  that of obtaining distance measures between related chinese dialects . however , he does this at a lexical level by using karl pearson s tetrachoric correlation coefficient on 905 words from a lexical dictionary @xcite .",
    "this paper takes a novel approach to this problem by pioneering the use of phonological data to find dissimilarity measures , as opposed to lexical ( which has been used most frequently up till now ) , semantic or syntactic data .",
    "an argument can also be made that phonetic or phonological dissimilarity measures , being the least abstract of all , could give the most realistic results .",
    "unfortunately , studies in this direction have been relatively rare .",
    "two such works which should be mentioned are and , both of which are , however , constrained by the use of lexicostatistical methodology . in fairness to existing methods , it must be noted that many other existing methods for obtaining dissimilarity measures are in fact applicable to non - lexical data for deriving non - lexical measures . in practice , though , they have been constrained by a preoccupation with the lexicon as well as by the unavailability of phonological data .",
    "hopefully , the phonological data developed in this project should provide fresh input to those methods and revive their application to the problem area in future research .",
    "the data we use to illustrate our ideas are two phonological histories taken from the field of chinese linguistics .",
    "one is an account of the modern beijing ( mb ) dialect from an earlier stage of chinese , referred to as middle chinese , and published as ; the other is an account of the modern cantonese ( mc ) dialect also from middle chinese , published as chen and newman ( 1984a , 1984b and 1985 ) .",
    "these should be consulted for further explanation of the diachronic rules and their relative chronology as well as for an explanation of the rule labels used in this paper . for brevity",
    ", we will refer to the former as chen76 and the latter as cn84 in subsequent sections .",
    "we would now like to draw attention to five features of these accounts which make them ideal for the purpose at hand :    1 .",
    "the accounts are relatively explicit in their expositions .",
    "each account assumes middle chinese reconstructions which are phonetically explicit , states each rule in a formal style , and defines the ordering relationships which hold between the rules .",
    "this degree of comprehensiveness and explicitness in writing the history of a language is relatively rare .",
    "it is even rarer to have accounts of two related dialects described in a similarly explicit way . obviously , when it comes to translating historical accounts into phonological derivations , the more explicit the original account , the more readily one can arrive at the derivations .",
    "the two accounts assume identical reconstructions for the middle chinese forms , which of course is crucial in any meaningful comparison of the two dialects .",
    "not surprisingly , given the existence of sinology as an established field and one with a history going back well over a hundred years , there are many conflicting proposals about middle chinese and its pronunciation .",
    "decisions about the forms of middle chinese go hand in hand , necessarily , with corresponding decisions about the historical rules which lead from those forms to modern - day reflexes .",
    "one can not easily compare competing historical accounts if they assume different reconstructed forms as their starting points .",
    "see chen76 for a full description and justification of the middle chinese reconstructions used in these accounts .",
    "the two accounts are couched in terms of one phonological framework .",
    "this , too , is a highly desirable feature when it comes to making comparisons between the sets of rules involved in each account .",
    "the framework could be described as a somehwat `` relaxed '' version of spe @xcite .",
    "for example , the accounts make use of orthodox spe features alongside others where it was thought appropriate ( e.g. [ + /-",
    "labial ] , [ + /-",
    "acute ] ) .",
    "phonotactic conditions are utilized as a way of triggering certain phonological changes , alongside more conventional rule statements .",
    "the accounts purport to describe the phonological histories of a single database of chinese characters and their readings in modern dialects @xcite .",
    "this is a substantial database containing about 2,700 chinese characters and it is the readings of these characters in two of the dialects  modern beijing and modern cantonese which are the outputs of the rule derivations in the two accounts .",
    "the accounts themselves are published in an easily available journal , _ the journal of chinese linguistics _ , which allows readers to scrutinize the original discussion and rule statements .",
    "the features alluded to in points 15 make these two accounts uniquely suited to testing out formal hypotheses relating to historical phonology .",
    "the historical account of modern beijing / modern cantonese is construed as a set of derivations .",
    "the input to a derivation is a reconstructed middle chinese form ; the input is subjected to a battery of ( ordered ) phonological rules ; and the output of the derivation is the reflex in the modern dialect .",
    "the mechanistic model we have used to represent diachronic phonological derivations is that of probabilistic finite state automata ( pfsa ) .",
    "these are state determined machines which have stochastic transition functions .",
    "the derivation of each word in mb or mc from middle chinese consists of a sequence of diachronic rules .",
    "these rule sequences for each of the approximately 2700 words are used to construct our pfsa .",
    "node 0 of the pfsa corresponds to the reconstructed form of the word in middle chinese .",
    "arcs leading out of states in the pfsa represent particular rules that were applied to a form at that state , transforming it into a new intermediate form .",
    "a transition on a delimiter symbol , which always returns to state 0 , signifies the end of a derivation process whereby the final form in the daughter language has been arrived at .",
    "the weightings on the arcs represent the number of times that particular arc was traversed in processing the entire corpus of words .",
    "the complete pfsa then represents the phonological complexity of the derivation process from middle chinese into one of the modern dialects .",
    "if this is the case , then the length of the minimal description of the pfsa would be indicative of the distance between the parent and daughter languages .",
    "there are two levels at which the diachronic complexity can be measured .",
    "the first is of the canonical pfsa , which is a trie encoding of the rules .",
    "this is the length of the diachronic phonological hypothesis accounting for the given dataset .",
    "the second is of a minimised version of the canonical machine .",
    "our minimisation is performed initially using the sk - strings method of and then reducing the resultant automaton further with a beam search heuristic .",
    "the sk - strings method constructs a non - deterministic finite state automaton from its canonical version by successively merging states that are indistinguishable for the top s% of their most probable output strings limited to a length of @xmath0 symbols . both _",
    "s _ and _ k _ are variable parameters that can be set when starting program execution . in this paper ,",
    "the reduced automata are the best ones that could be inferred using any value of string size ( @xmath0 ) from 1 to 10 and any value of the agreement percentage ( @xmath1 ) from 1 to 100 .",
    "the beam search method reduces the pfsa by searching recursively through the best @xmath2 descendants of the current pfsa where a descendant is defined to be the result of merging any two nodes in the parent pfsa .",
    "the variable parameter @xmath2 is called the beam size and determines the exhaustiveness of the search . in this paper , @xmath2 was set to 200 , which was the maximum the sun sparcserver 1000 with 256 mb of main memory could tolerate .",
    "the final resultant pfsa , minimised thus is , strictly speaking , a generalisation of the proposed phonology .",
    "its size is not really indicative of the complexity of the original hypothesis , but it serves to bring to light important patterns which repeat themselves in the data .",
    "the minimisation , in effect , forms additional diachronic rules and highlights regular patterns to a linguist .",
    "the size of this structure is also given in our results to show the effect of further generalisation to the linguistic hypothesis .",
    "a final point needs to be made regarding the motivation for the additional sophistication embodied in this method as compared to , say , a more simplistic phonological approach like a distance measure based on a simple summation of the number of proposed rules .",
    "our method not only gives a measure dependent on the number of rules , but also on the inter - relationship between them , or the regularity present in the whole phonology .",
    "a lower value indicates the presence of greater regularity in the derivation process . as a case in point",
    ", we may look at two closely related dialects , which have the same number of rules in their phonology from a common parent",
    ". it may be the case that one has diverged more by losing more of its original structure .",
    "as in the method of internal reconstruction , if we assume that the complexity of a language increases with time due to the presence of residual forms @xcite , the pfsa derived for the more distant language will have a greater complexity than the other .",
    "the derivations that were used in constructing the pfsa were traced out individually for each of the 2714 forms and entered into a spreadsheet for further processing .",
    "the relative chronologies ( rc ) of the diachronic rules given in chen76 and cn84 propose rule orderings based on bleeding and feeding relationships between rules .",
    "we have tried to be as consistent as possible to the rc proposed in chen76 and cn84 .",
    "for the most part , we view violations to the rc as exceptions to their hypothesis .",
    "consistency with the rc proposed in chen76 and cn84 has been maintained as far as possible .",
    "for the most part , violations to them are viewed as serious exceptions . thus if rule a is ordered before rule b in the rc , but is required to apply after rule b in a specific instance under consideration , it is made an exceptional application of rule a , denoted by `` [ a ] '' .",
    "such exceptional rules are considered distinct from their normal forms .",
    "the sequence of rules deriving beijing _ tou _ from middle chinese _ to _ ( `` all '' ) , for example , is given as `` t1-split : raise - u : diphthong - u : chamel : '' .",
    "however , `` diphthong - u '' is ordered before `` raise - u '' in the rc . the earlier rule in the rc",
    "is thus made an exceptional application and the rule sequence is given instead as `` t1-split : raise - u:[diphthong - u]:chamel : '' .",
    "there are also some exceptional phonological changes not accounted for by cn84 or chen76 . in these cases",
    ", we form a new rule representing the change that took place , denote it in square brackets to show its exceptional status .",
    "related exceptions are grouped together as a single exceptional rule .",
    "for example ,",
    "tone-4 in middle chinese only changes to tone-1a or tone-2 in beijing when the form has a voiceless initial .",
    "however , for the middle chinese form _ niat _",
    "( `` pinch with fingers '' ) in tone-4 , the corresponding beijing form is _ nie _ in tone-1a .",
    "since the n - initial is voiced , the t4-tripart rule is considered to apply exceptionally .",
    "the complete rule sequence is thus denoted by `` raise - i : apocope : chamel:[t4 ] : '' where the `` [ t4 ] '' exceptional rule covers cases when tone-4 in smc unexpectedly changed into tone-1a or tone-2 in beijing in the absence of a voiceless initial .",
    "it also needs to be mentioned that there are a few cases where an environment for the application of a rule might exist , but the rule itself may not apply although it is required to by the linguistic hypothesis .",
    "this would constitute an exception again .",
    "the details of how to handle this situation more accurately are left as a topic for future work , but we try to account for it here by applying a special rule [ ! a ] where the ` ! ' is meant to indicate that the rule a did nt apply when it ought to have . as an example",
    ", we may consider the derivation of modern cantonese _",
    "hap_(tone 4a ) from middle chinese _",
    "k^h^ap_(tone 4 ) ( `` exactly '' ) . the sequence of rules deriving the mc form is `` t4-split : spirant : x - weak : '' .",
    "however , since the environment is appropriate ( voiceless initial ) for the application of a further rule , ac - split , after t4-split had applied , the non - application of this additional rule is specified as an exception . thus ,",
    "`` t4-split : spirant : x - weak:[!ac - split ] : '' is the actual rule sequence used .    in general , the following conventions in representing and treating exceptions have been followed as far as possible : exceptional rules are always denoted in square brackets .",
    "they are considered excluded from the rc and thus are consistently ordered at the end of the rest of the derivation process wherever possible .",
    "a final detail concerns the status of allophonic changes in the phonology .",
    "the derivation process is actually two - stage , comprising a diachronic phase during which phonological changes take place and a synchronic phase during which allophonic changes are automatically applied .",
    "changes caused by cantonese or beijing phonotactic constraints ( pcs ) are treated as allophonic rules and fall into the synchronic category , whereas pcs applying to earlier forms are treated in line with the regular diachronic rules which chen76 calls p - rules .",
    "a minor problem presents itself when it comes to making a clear - cut separation between the historical rules proper and the synchronic allophonic rules . in chen76 and cn84 ,",
    "they are not really considered part of the historical derivation process .",
    "yet it was found that the environment for the application of a diachronic rule is sometimes produced by an allophonic rule .",
    "such feeding relationships between allophonic and diachronic rules make the classification of those allophonic rules difficult .",
    "the only rule considered allophonic in beijing is the * chamel pc , this being a rule which determines the exact qualities of mb vowels . for cantonese ,",
    "cn84 has included two allophonic rules within its rc under bleeding and feeding relationships with p - rules .",
    "these are the break - c and y - fuse rules , both of which concern vocalic detail . in these cases ,",
    "every instance of their application within the diachronic phonology has been treated as an exception , effectively elevating these exceptions to the status of diachronic rules .",
    "in other cases , as with other allophonic rules , they are always ordered after all the diachronic rules . since the problem regarding the status of allophonic rules in general is properly in the domain of historical linguists , it is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "it was thus decided to provide two complexity measures  one including allophonic detail and one excluding all allophonic detail not required for the derivation process .",
    "the minimum message length ( mml ) principle of is used to compute the complexity of the pfsa . for brevity",
    ", we will henceforth call the minimum message length of pfsa as the mml of pfsa or where the context serves to disambiguate , simply mml .    in the context of data transmission ,",
    "the mml of a set of symbols is the minimum number of bits needed to transmit a static model together with the data symbols given this model _ a priori_. in the context of pfsa ,",
    "the mml is a sum of :    * the length of encoding a description of the proposed machine * the length of encoding the dataset assuming it was emitted by the proposed machine    the following formula is used for the purpose of computing the mml : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of states in the pfsa , @xmath5 is the number of times the @xmath6 state is visited , @xmath7 is the cardinality of the alphabet including the delimiter symbol , @xmath8 the frequency of the @xmath9 arc from the @xmath6 state , @xmath10 is the number of different arcs from the @xmath6 state and @xmath11 is the number of different arcs on non - delimiter symbols from the @xmath6 state .",
    "the logs are to the base 2 and the mml is in bits .    the mml formula given above assumes a non - uniform prior on the distribution of outgoing arcs from a given state .",
    "this contrasts with the mdl criterion due to which recommends the usage of uniform priors .",
    "the specific prior used in the specification of @xmath10 is @xmath12 , i.e. the probability that a state has @xmath13 outgoing arcs is @xmath14 .",
    "thus @xmath10 is directly specified in the formula using just @xmath10 bits and the rest of the structure specification assumes this .",
    "it is also assumed that targets of transitions on delimiter symbols return to the start state ( state 0 for example ) and thus do nt have to be specified .",
    "the formula is a modification for non - deterministic automata of the formula in where it is stated with two typographical errors ( the factorials in the numerators are absent ) .",
    "it is itself a correction ( through personal communication ) of the formula in which follows on from work in numerical taxonomy @xcite that applied the mml principle to derive information measures for classification .",
    "the results of our analysis are given in tables  [ tbl : canon - mml ] ( for canonical pfsa ) and  [ tbl : reduced - mml ] ( for reduced pfsa ) .",
    "row 1 represents pfsa which have only diachronic detail in them and row 2 represents pfsa which do not distinguish between diachronic and allophonic detail .",
    "column 1 represents the mml of the pfsa derived for modern cantonese and and column 2 represents the mml of pfsa for modern beijing . as mentioned in section  [ sec : mod ] , smaller values of the mml reflect a greater regularity in the structure .",
    ".mmls for the canonical pfsa for middle chinese to modern cantonese and modern beijing respectively [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the canonical pfsa are too large and complex to be printed on a4 paper using viewable type . however , it is possible to trim off some of the low frequency arcs from the reduced pfsa to alleviate the problem of presenting them graphically .",
    "thus the reduced pfsa for modern beijing and modern cantonese are presented in figures  [ fig : mand - opfsa ] and  [ fig : cant - opfsa ] at the end of this paper , but arcs with a frequency less than 10 have been pruned from them . since several arcs have been pruned , the pfsa may not make complete sense as some nodes may have outgoing transitions without incoming ones and vice - versa .",
    "there is further a small amount of overprinting .",
    "they are solely for the purposes of visualisation of the end - results and not meant to serve any other useful purpose .",
    "the arc frequencies are indicated in superscript font above the symbol , except when there is more than one symbol on an arc , in which case the frequencies are denoted by the superscript marker `` '' .",
    "exclamation marks ( `` ! '' ) indicate arcs on delimiter symbols to state 0 from the state they superscript .",
    "their superscripts represent the frequency .",
    "superficially , the pfsa may seem to resemble the graphical representation of the relative chronologies in chen76 and cn84 , but in fact they are more significant .",
    "they represent the actual sequences of rules used in deriving the forms rather than just the ordering relation among them .",
    "the frequencies on the arcs also give an idea of how many times a particular rule was applied to a word at a certain stage of its derivation process .",
    "certain rules that rarely apply may not show up in the diagram , but that is because arcs representing them have been pruned .",
    "the mml computation process , however , accounted for those as well .",
    "the complete data corpus , an explanation of the various exceptions to rules and the programs for constructing and reducing pfsa are available from the authors .",
    "the results obtained from the mmls of canonical machines show that there is a greater complexity in the diachronic phonology of modern beijing than there is in modern cantonese .",
    "these complexity measures may be construed as measures of distances between the languages and their ancestor . nevertheless we exercise caution in interpreting the results as such .",
    "the measures were obtained using just one of many reconstructions of middle chinese and one of many proposed diachronic phonologies .",
    "it is , of course , hypothetically possible that a simplistic reconstruction and an overly generalised phonology could give smaller complexity measures by resulting in less complex pfsa .",
    "one might argue that this wrongly indicates that the method of obtaining distances as described here points to the simplistic reconstruction as the better one .",
    "this problem arises partly because of the fact that the methodology outlined here assumes all linguistic hypotheses to be equally likely _ a - priori_. we note , however , that simplicity and descriptive economy are not the only grounds for preferring one linguistic hypothesis to another @xcite .",
    "many other factors are usually taken into consideration to ensure whether a reconstruction is linguistically viable .",
    "plausibility and elegance @xcite , knowledge of what kinds of linguistic changes are likely and what are unlikely @xcite , and in the case of chinese , insights of the `` chinese philological tradition '' @xcite are all used when deciding the viability of a linguistic reconstruction .",
    "thus , a final conclusion about the linguistic problem of subgrouping is still properly within the domain of historical linguists .",
    "this paper just provides a valuable tool to help quantify one of the important parameters that is used in their decision procedure .",
    "we make a further observation about the results that the complexity measures for the phonologies of modern beijing and modern cantonese are not immensely different from each other .",
    "interestingly also , while the mml of the canonical pfsa for modern beijing is greater than that for modern cantonese , the mml of the reduced pfsa for modern beijing is less than that for modern cantonese .",
    "while the differences might be within the margin of error in constructing the derivations and the pfsa , it is possible to speculate that the generalisation process has been able to discern more structure in the diachronic phonology of modern beijing than in modern cantonese . from a computational point of view",
    ", one could say that the scope for further generalisation of the diachronic rules is greater for modern cantonese than for modern beijing or that there is greater structure in the evolution of modern beijing from middle chinese than in the evolution of cantonese .",
    "one could perhaps claim that this is due to the extra liberty taken historically by current modern cantonese speakers to introduce changes into their language as compared to their mandarin speaking neighbours .",
    "but it would be nave to conclude so here .",
    "the study of the actual socio - cultural factors which would have resulted in this situation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is also no surprise that the mmls obtained for the two languages are not very different from each other although the difference is large enough to be statistically significant .",
    "bits ( however small @xmath13 is ) would point to an odds ratio of 1:@xmath15 that the larger pfsa is more complex than the smaller one .",
    "the explanation is not directly applicable in this case as we are comparing two different data sets and so further theoretical developments are necessary . ] indeed , this is to be expected as they are both contemporary and have descended from a common ancestor",
    ". we can expect more interesting results when deriving complexity measures for the phonologies of languages that are more widely separated in time and space .",
    "it is here that the method described in this paper can provide an effective tool for subgrouping .",
    "in this paper , we have provided an objective framework which will enable us to obtain distance measures between related languages . the method has been illustrated and the first step towards actually applying it for historical chinese linguistics has also been taken .",
    "it has been pointed out to us , though , that the methodology described in this paper could in fact be put to better use than in just deriving distance measures .",
    "the suggestion was that it should be possible , in principle , to use the method to choose between competing reconstructions of protolanguages as this tends to be a relatively more contentious area than subgrouping .",
    "it is indeed possible to use the method to do this  we could retain the basic procedure , but shift the focus from studying two descendants of a common parent to studying two proposed parents of a common set of descendants . a protolanguage is usually postulated in conjunction with a set of diachronic rules that derive forms in the descendant languages .",
    "we could thus use the methodology described in this paper to derive a large number of forms in the descendant languages from each of the two competing protolanguages . since descriptive economy is one of the deciding factors in selecting historical linguistic hypotheses , the size of each body of derivations , suitably encoded in the form of automata , in conjunction with other linguistic considerations",
    "will then give the plausibility of that reconstruction .",
    "further study of this line of approach is , however , left as a topic for future research .",
