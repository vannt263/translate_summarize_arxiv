    "closed , isolated physical systems , whose dynamics is described by a hamiltonian @xmath2 , reach for long times a thermodynamic equilibrium state in which each microstate with total energy @xmath3 has equal weight @xmath4 : the so - called microcanonical ensemble . when brought into contact with a heat reservoir , so that the energy is not fixed but fluctuates around an average value , the system is described by the canonical distribution @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the inverse temperature .",
    "an essential observation is that in both cases the equilibrium distribution is completely known in terms of the hamiltonian , without the need to explicitly solve the dynamics generated by @xmath2 .",
    "the situation is quite different in the case of _ driven _",
    "systems , where the dynamics does not satisfy the detailed balance condition , and prevents the system from reaching thermal equilibrium , e.g.  due to an external driving field or due to heat reservoirs at different temperatures .",
    "an example of the latter is a fluid layer heated from above and cooled from below , so that a temperature gradient across the layer is maintained .",
    "after long times this system reaches a non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "the corresponding phase space distribution can only be determined by explicitly solving the dynamics , e.g.  using kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "it is helpful to study simple models for driven systems to gain insight in the nature of non - equilibrium steady states , and to compare theoretical predictions with the result of computer simulations .",
    "it is in fact simple to define models with stochastic dynamics that violate detailed - balance .",
    "a class of models that has been studied quite extensively in recent years are driven kinetic ising models with kawasaki - type spin - flip dynamics @xcite and certain particle hopping models @xcite .",
    "for a recent review see ref .",
    "computer simulations have revealed algebraic decay of the density - density correlation function , i.e.  @xmath7 for large @xmath8 , in the stationary state . although the exponent @xmath9 can be determined from symmetry considerations alone , using a langevin equation approach @xcite , there is currently no theory available that predicts the _ amplitude _ @xmath10 of the tail .",
    "we propose lattice gas automata ( lga s ) as an alternative class of simplified models that can be used to study the basic properties of non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "but more importantly , we present a systematic approximate theory for the large distance behavior of the correlation function of conserved quantities .",
    "thus we are able to calculate the amplitude of the algebraic tails , starting from the microscopic definition of the model .",
    "in addition to the type of lattice on which particles move and a required set of local conservation laws ( particle density , momentum density , etc . ) , an lga is defined by a set of stochastic transition probabilities that define the stochastic collision rules at each node . in the context of lga s",
    "there is a distinction between collision rules that satisfy the condition of detailed or semi - detailed - balance @xcite , and rules that violate this condition .",
    "semi - detailed - balance models reach for long times a completely factorized equilibrium state that is independent of the transition probabilities",
    ". however , to study non - equilibrium steady states of driven systems one needs to consider models with collision rules that violate semi - detailed balance .",
    "such collision rules are incompatible with a factorized state . strong violation of semi - detailed - balance may even lead to spatial instability and pattern formation  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of lga s over ising - type models is that can be used to model nonequilibrium states of _ fluids _ as well . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is explained how non - detailed - balance lga - fluids are to be considered as generalizations of driven diffusive systems .",
    "here we exclusively deal with lga s having only stable modes , so that after long times a spatially homogeneous , but correlated equilibrium state is reached .",
    "( note that we use the term ` equilibrium state ' as a synonym for ` steady state ' , to emphasize that we consider lga s driven only through strictly local collision rules that are the same for each node and applied simultaneously to each node at each time step . )",
    "such lga s can be interpreted as effective models , whose dynamics represents a coarse - grained , mesoscopic description of a physical system kept out of thermal equilibrium . due to their discrete nature",
    "lga s are relatively easy to analyze , and studying their behavior will provide insight in the physics of non - equilibrium processes .",
    "on the other hand , many authors use lga s lacking detailed - balance to model physical phenomena , without analyzing how the lack of detailed - balance may affect the validity of their conclusions .",
    "it is therefore important to have a fundamental understanding of the statistical mechanics of non - detailed - balance lga s .    to describe the correlations occurring in the correlated equilibrium state of non - detailed - balance lga s a microscopic description beyond the boltzmann equation",
    "is required .",
    "bussemaker , ernst , and dufty @xcite were the first to derive kinetic equations for lga s at the level of pair correlations , by neglecting three point and higher order correlation functions .",
    "this theory successfully predicts the magnitude of the pair correlations between occupation numbers at the same or at nearby nodes , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite by numerically evaluating the solution to the kinetic equations , and comparing it with simulation results .    here",
    "we extend the analysis to _ large distances _ , and show that all lga s lacking detailed - balance possess spatial correlations between fluctuations of locally conserved quantities that decay _ algebraically _ for large distances .",
    "this is surprising since the collision rules only involve occupation numbers at the same node : zero range interactions thus lead to infinite range correlations .",
    "the mechanism that is responsible for the buildup of these long range correlations involves the slow evolution of diffusive or hydrodynamic modes at large scales .",
    "it is the same mechanism that is responsible for the existence of the well - known long time tails in hydrodynamic time correlation functions of equilibrium fluids , and the logarithmic density dependence of transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] we recapitulate the kinetic equations of ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of excess correlation functions , and obtain an expression for the pair correlation function in terms of diffusive or hydrodynamic modes that resembles results derived from the phenomenological mode coupling theory .",
    "this expression is analyzed for interacting random walkers on a square lattice with x - y anisotropy in section  [ sec : irw - xy ] , and with the full square lattice symmetry in section  [ sec : irw - square ] . in section",
    "[ sec : fluid ] we discuss a fluid - type lga with full triangular lattice symmetry , which exhibits long range momentum correlations .",
    "we end with a discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we consider an lga defined on a @xmath11-dimensional lattice of linear size @xmath12 .",
    "the lattice has periodic boundary conditions and contains @xmath13 nodes . in this paper",

    "we will consider two specific lga s in this paper : ( i ) a model defined on a square lattice , where @xmath18 are the nearest neighbor vectors @xmath20 with @xmath21 , and ( ii ) a model defined on a triangular lattice , where @xmath22 for @xmath23 ; in addition there may be a channel @xmath24 for a rest particle with @xmath25 .",
    "the absence , respectively presence , of a particle in channel @xmath17 is denoted by boolean occupation numbers @xmath26 .",
    "the state of a node @xmath15 is denoted by @xmath27 . during the _ collision step _ of the lga",
    "the precollision state @xmath28 is replaced by a postcollision state @xmath29 at all nodes simultaneously , according to a stochastic process with transition probabilities @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31 matrix @xmath32 is normalized : @xmath33 the collision step is followed by a _ propagation step _ during which a particle with post - collisional velocity @xmath18 is moved from node @xmath34 to a neighboring node @xmath35 .",
    "the combined collision and propagation steps constitute a time evolution of the entire lga from time @xmath36 to time @xmath37 .    in most lga s",
    "the collision rules satisfy certain local conservation laws . for instance , in an lga describing the diffusive behavior of ( interacting ) random walkers , the number of particles at a node does not change during collision , but the distribution among velocity directions does .",
    "this conservation law is conveniently formulated in terms of the collisional invariant @xmath38 . in a fluid - type lga the local momentum at each node",
    "is also conserved during collision , and we have @xmath39 .",
    "nonzero transition probabilities @xmath40 are only allowed if @xmath41 or , stated compactly , the matrix @xmath32 must satisfy @xmath42    the transition matrix @xmath32 is said to satisfy the _ semi - detailed - balance _ or stueckelberg condition @xcite if @xmath43 the stronger _ detailed - balance _ condition , @xmath44 , implies semi - detailed - balance on account of the normalization ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that if eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) holds , the equilibrium distribution is completely factorized over all @xmath45 channels @xmath17 , and only depends on the microscopic state through global invariants , like the total number of particles or the total momentum @xcite .",
    "since the collision step does not change the value of these invariants , it follows that the equilibrium distribution is invariant under the collision step .",
