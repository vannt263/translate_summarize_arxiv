    "recent scanning force microscope experiments @xcite and subsequent theoretical work @xcite have shown that screening effects , notably the occurrence of `` incompressible strips '' @xcite , are very important for the understanding of the hall - field and current distribution as well as the high precision of the low - temperature integer quantized hall ( qh ) effect in narrow hall samples . since coulomb interactions should become important within and between the layers of an electron bilayer system showing the _ drag effect _",
    "@xcite at very low temperatures , we extended the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite to the bilayer case and calculated the hall and longitudinal resistances for density - matched and mismatched systems .",
    "magnetoresistance ( mr ) measurements on separately contacted bilayers , which were performed to check the results , showed pronounced hysteresis effects , similar to results reported previously for hole @xcite and electron @xcite double layers . in contrast to this previous work , our approach makes the origin of the hysteresis rather evident : the peculiar nonlinear screening properties leading to the occurrence of `` incompressible strips '' in the qh regimes of the individual layers .",
    "we measured the mrs of both layers as functions of the applied perpendicular magnetic field and the sweep direction for matched and mismatched densities at a fixed base temperature ( @xmath0mk ) within the linear response regime ( @xmath1na ) .",
    "measured hall ( upper panel ) and longitudinal ( lower panel ) resistances for the top layer and the bottom layer ( long - dashed lines , only for the mismatched case and one sweep direction ) .",
    "no hysteresis is observed for the matched case ( green dashed - dotted line ) and the `` equilibrium measurement '' ( solid line with circles ) , with @xmath2 . ]",
    "longitudinal resistances versus magnetic field , for both layers and two sweep directions with @xmath3 . ]",
    "we also performed `` equilibrium '' measurements , where the system was heated up to @xmath4k and cooled down again at each magnetic sweep step , in the magnetic field interval where hysteresis is observed .",
    "the samples are @xmath5 nm wide gaas / algaas double quantum well structures grown by mbe and capped by top and bottom gates that control the electron densities of the layers .",
    "two 2des are confined by @xmath6 doping remote si donors and are separated by a spacer of thickness @xmath7 nm .",
    "for such a separation the bilayer system is electronically decoupled , i.e. electron tunneling between the layers ( @xmath8m@xmath9 ) is not possible and the system can be described by two different electrochemical potentials .",
    "separate ohmic contacts to the two layers are realized by a selective depletion technique @xcite .",
    "the samples were processed into @xmath10 m wide and @xmath11 m long hall bars , with grown densities in the range @xmath12m@xmath13 , the mobility is @xmath14m@xmath15/vs per layer",
    ".    figure  [ fig : experiment1 ] shows hall and longitudinal resistances of the top layer versus magnetic field strength , measured under different conditions . as a reference ,",
    "the resistances of the bottom layer ( long - dashed lines ) are also shown for one sweep direction in the mismatched case . in the `` equilibrium measurements '' ( solid lines with symbols ) explained above and also in the case of matched densities",
    "the resistances are insensitive to the sweep direction .",
    "note that the qh plateau for matched densities is narrower than that of the mismatched system in the `` equilibrium measurement '' .",
    "for the density mismatched ( and non - equilibrium ) case , the data were taken at a sweep rate @xmath16t / min and the base temperature is always kept at @xmath17mk .",
    "apparently the resistances of the top layer follow different traces for the up- ( red dotted lines ) and the down- ( black solid lines ) sweep .",
    "figure [ fig : exphysteresis ] shows that , for density - mismatched bilayers , hysteresis occurs in both layers under comparable conditions .",
    "the hysteresis shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment1 ] occurs in the top layer near the high-@xmath18 edge of the @xmath19 qh plateau ( plateau region @xmath20t@xmath21 t ) .",
    "it occurs in a @xmath18-interval well within the @xmath19 qh plateau ( @xmath22t@xmath23 t ) of the bottom layer .",
    "similarly , the mr of the bottom layer shows hysteresis at the low-@xmath18 edge of its @xmath19 qh plateau , in a @xmath18-interval well within the @xmath19 qh plateau of the top layer .",
    "no hysteresis is observed in magnetic field intervals in which the other layer is in the normal state , with finite longitudinal resistance .",
    "a less pronounced repetition of these features is observed in the @xmath24 plateau regimes .",
    "we model the electron bilayer system as a series of parallel charged planes , perpendicular to the @xmath25-direction , translation invariant in the @xmath26-direction , and confined to @xmath27 .",
    "the bottom and top 2dess with number densities @xmath28 and @xmath29 lie in the planes @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "ionized donor layers with number densities @xmath32 and @xmath33 are assumed at @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and a top gate at @xmath36 , allowing for a density mismatch even with @xmath37 , is simulated by ionized donors with number density @xmath38 at @xmath39 . solving poisson s equation with the boundary condition @xmath40 , we obtain from the charge densities @xmath41 in the plane @xmath42 as contribution to the potential energy of an electron at position @xmath43 : v^j(x , z)= _",

    "we write the total potential energy of an electron as [ vbplusvt ] v(x , z)=v^b(x , z)+v^t(x , z ) , where @xmath48 is the sum of the potentials created by bottom electron and donor layer , while @xmath49 is the sum of the potentials due to the top electron , donor , and gate layers .",
    "the electron number densities in the layers are , within the thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) , n^j_el(x)=ded(e)f([e+v(x , z_j)-^_j]/k_bt ) [ tfaed]with @xmath50 or @xmath51 and @xmath52 the ( collision - broadened ) landau density of states .",
    "this completes the self - consistency scheme @xcite . in the practical calculations we first decoupled the layers , replacing @xmath53 by @xmath54 , and solved the single electron - layer problem for bottom and top system separately .",
    "there it is convenient to fix the edges @xmath55 of the electron density profile in the limit of zero magnetic field and temperature @xcite , which fixes the average density ( and @xmath56 ) . with the converged results at finite @xmath51 and @xmath18",
    ", we treat the inter - layer coupling iteratively . to describe the density - mismatched case , we add more electrons to the top layer by setting @xmath57 to a positive value and keeping the depletion length @xmath58 fixed .",
    "we scale energies by the average fermi energy @xmath59 , e.g. @xmath60 .",
    "next we implement in each electron layer a quasi - local model to impose a current , following the lines of ref .",
    "it is based on a local version of ohm s law , @xmath61 between current density @xmath62 to driving electric field @xmath63 .",
    "the position - dependent conductivity tensor @xmath64 is taken from a bulk calculation @xcite , with the electron density @xmath65 replaced by the local one , and a spatial smoothening over a length of the order of the fermi wave length is performed , in order to avoid unphysical artifacts of a strictly local transport model and of the tfa @xcite .",
    "typical results with a slightly modulated donor distribution @xmath66 $ ] , introduced to simulate the long - range - part of the impurity potentials @xcite , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonequdens ] .",
    "values ( right panel ) .",
    "the density mismatch is obtained by setting @xmath67 which results in @xmath68 at a low temperature @xmath69 for fixed @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath71 is the pinch - off energy which defines the minimum of the bare confinement potential .",
    "[ fig : nonequdens ] ]",
    "the quasi - equilibrium model just introduced is , of course , not able to describe hysteresis effects .",
    "it yields , however , qualitatively correct results for the matched density case ( @xmath72 ) , where the mrs for both layers are identical , and for the mismatched systems it yields results in qualitative agreement with those found in the `` equilibrium measurements '' . moreover , the results shown in fig .  [ fig : nonequdens ] give some hints towards the possible origin of the hysteresis effects .",
    "we see that , in the plateau regime of the qh effect , i.e. , in the magnetic field interval in which incompressible strips ( iss ) exist @xcite , the position of the incompressible strips [ local filling factor @xmath73 and the potential distribution change drastically .",
    "to realize these changes , electrons must be transported , e.g.  by thermal activation , across the iss . in real samples ( of finite length )",
    "this is extremely difficult , since states at the fermi level exist on both sides of an is but not within the is , and since the region between iss is not connected to the contacts .",
    "therefore , after a slight change of the magnetic field , it may take an extremely long time until the electron density relaxes to its new equilibrium distribution @xcite .    to simulate this hindered approach to equilibrium",
    ", we calculate the mrs of the current - carrying layer in a @xmath18-interval in which the other layer exhibits a qh plateau , using different frozen - in density and potential distributions for up- and down - sweeps of the magnetic field @xmath18 . for the down - sweep",
    ", we freeze in the density profile of the other layer at the high-@xmath18 edge of its qh plateau and for the up - sweep we freeze it in at the low-@xmath18 edge , and use these fixed potentials to describe the other layer when calculating the equilibrium and transport properties of the current - carrying layer .",
    "thus , for the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonequdens ] , we calculate the mrs of the bottom layer in the qh plateau regime of the top layer by fixing the potential due to the top layer at @xmath74 for the down - sweep and at @xmath75 for the up - sweep . to calculate the mrs of the top layer in the plateau regime of the bottom layer",
    ", we fix the potential profile of the bottom layer at @xmath76 for the down - sweep and at @xmath77 for the up - sweep .",
    "since the mrs slightly outside the qh plateau regimes depend on the electron and current density profiles @xcite , we will obtain slightly different results for the different sweep directions .",
    "figure  [ bare12 ] shows longitudinal magnetoresistances calculated along such lines .",
    "we report on measurements and calculations of the magnetoresistances in separately contacted _ e - e _ bilayer systems .",
    "the calculation , based on a self - consistent thomas - fermi - poisson theory of the equilibrium state and a quasi - local transport theory @xcite , yields reasonable agreement with the measurements for density - matched layers and for mismatched layers , if the measurement allows for thermal relaxation at each value of the magnetic field @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath18-sweeps at constantly low temperature show hysteresis between up and down sweep in the current - carrying layer , provided the other layer exhibits the quantized hall effect .",
    "a model , based on the existence of incompressible regions in the quantum hall states @xcite and the extremely long relaxation times in compressible regions surrounded by incompressible ones @xcite , is worked out and can explain the observed hysteresis effects ."
