    "x - ray observations of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) revealed a surprisingly rich population of high mass x - ray binaries in this close neighbour of the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at the time of writing , about 50 sources of this type have been identified in the smc with the majority of discovered systems being be / x - ray binaries .",
    "existence of such a rich population of hmxbs in a nearby galaxy opens unique possibility to study properties of population of hmxbs .",
    "as has been shown by @xcite , the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of hmxbs obeys , to the first approximation , a universal power law distribution with the differential slope of @xmath10 , whose normalization is proportional to the star formation rate of the host galaxy .",
    "the validity of this universal hmxb xlf has been established in a broad range of the star formation rates and regimes and in the luminosity range @xmath11 .",
    "based on the asca observations of the small magellanic cloud and on the behavior of the integrated x - ray luminosity of distant galaxies located at redshifts @xmath12 observed by chandra in the hubble deep field north , @xcite tentatively suggested , that the hmxb xlf is not dramatically affected by the metallicity variations .",
    "study of the population of high mass x - ray binaries in the smc is of importance for several reasons :    1 .",
    "the magellanic clouds are known to have a significant under - abundance of metals @xcite .",
    "for example , the interstellar medium of the smc has a mean metallicity 0.6 dex lower than the local ism , the [ fe / h ] of young objects ( age@xmath13gyr ) in the smc is 0.5  dex lower than in the solar vicinity @xcite .",
    "the effects of the metallicity variations on the population of x - ray binaries are poorly understood .",
    "study of the smc , a galaxy with relatively well known chemical composition gives a unique opportunity to investigate such effects observationally .",
    "2 .   owing to the proximity of the smc ,",
    "the weakest sources become reachable within a moderate observing time .",
    "indeed , the sensitivity of a typical chandra or xmm - newton observation , @xmath14 erg / s/@xmath2 corresponds to the luminosity of @xmath15 erg / s at the smc distance .",
    "this opens the possibility to study the low luminosity end of the hmxb xlf .",
    "in addition , the proximity of the smc allows to study the properties of its stellar population and the star formation history in details .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the present paper we study population of x - ray binaries in the smc based on the archival xmm - newton data .",
    "the distance modulus of the smc is @xmath16 @xcite , corresponding to the distance of @xmath17 kpc .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "xmm - newton observations and data analysis are described in the section  [ sec : data ] . in the section  [ sec : nature ]",
    "we discuss nature of detected x - ray sources . in the section  [ sec : ident ]",

    "we have selected 9 xmm - newton archival observations with the pointing direction towards the smc and with sensitivity better than @xmath18 erg / s/@xmath2 in the 210 kev energy band .",
    "these observations are listed in table [ tb : pnt ] .",
    "fig.[fig : fir_map ] shows their fields of view , overlayed on the far - infrared map ( iras , @xmath19 ) of the small magellanic cloud .",
    "the observations were processed with science analysis system ( sas ) v6.0.0 . after filtering out high background intervals we extracted images in the 28 kev energy band .",
    "this energy range was chosen to minimize the fraction of cataclysmic variables and foreground stars among detected sources , generally having softer spectra than high mass x - ray binaries . to improve the sensitivity of the survey",
    ", images from mos1 and mos2 detectors have been merged .",
    "if both mos and pn data were available , we used the data having higher sensitivity .",
    "this was determined comparing the exposure times and taking into account that the effective area of pn is @xmath20 two times higher than the effective area of each of mos cameras .",
    "the source detection was performed with standard sas tasks _ eboxdetect _ and _ emldetect_. the value of the threshold likelihood @xmath21 used in emldetect task to accept or reject detected source was chosen as follows .",
    "we simulated a number of images with poisson background ( without sources ) .",
    "each of the generated images was analyzed with the full sequence of the source detection procedures using different values of the emldetect threshold likelihood @xmath21 and for each trial value of @xmath21 the number of detected `` sources '' was counted .",
    "the final value of the threshold likelihood , @xmath22 , was chosen such that the total number of spurious detections was @xmath23 per 9 images .",
    "the obtained images were visually inspected and the source lists were manually filtered of spurious sources near bright sources and sources whose extent undoubtedly exceeded psf size .",
    "the final merged source list contains @xmath24 sources .",
    "their flux distribution is plotted in fig.[fig : lf0 ] .",
    "the 28 kev source counts were converted to the 210 kev energy flux assuming a power law spectrum with the photon index 1 and n@xmath25=5@xmath26@xmath27 .",
    "the energy conversion factors are ecf@xmath28=2.95@xmath29 erg/@xmath2 and ecf@xmath30=1.0@xmath29 erg/@xmath2 .",
    "we note that , as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : cxb ] , significant part of sources in our sample are background agn .",
    "therefore , in sections  [ sec : cxb ] and  [ sec : cxbsrc ] ( figures  [ fig : area ] ,  [ fig : lf0 ] and  [ fig : cxb ] ) we used energy conversion factors calculated for photon index 1.7 , ecf@xmath28=2.27@xmath29 erg/@xmath2 and ecf@xmath30=8.0@xmath31 erg/@xmath2 , instead of values mentioned above .      for several xmm observations we performed boresight correction using optical sources from the mcps catalogue @xcite .",
    "the correction was applied in case when two or more well - known sufficiently bright x - ray sources with optical counterparts were found .",
    "naturally , the point source detection sensitivity varies from observation to observation and , for a given observation , across the telescope field of view .",
    "the reasons of these variations are difference in the exposure times , deterioration of the point spread function of the telescope with the increase of the off - axis angle , presence of the diffuse emission and background variations .",
    "these factors affect the completeness of the survey at low fluxes .",
    "the conventional way to account for these effects without setting too high conservative completeness limit , is to calculate ( using the sensitivity maps of individual observations ) the survey area as a function of flux . after appropriate normalisation",
    "it represents the fraction of sources we are able to detect as a function of flux , and can be used to correct the detected number of low - flux sources : @xmath32 where a(s ) is the survey area at flux s and a@xmath33 is the total ( geometrical ) survey area .",
    "the corrected cumulative log(n)log(s ) distribution can be obtained as follows : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the flux of the j - th source .",

    "[ fig : area ] one can see that the incompleteness effects become important at fluxes @xmath36erg / s/@xmath2 . in the high flux limit , the total area of the survey equals @xmath37 deg@xmath38 .",
    "the flux distribution , corrected for the incompleteness effects , is plotted as the thick histogram in fig.[fig : lf0 ] .",
    "the total number of sources with the flux @xmath39>2.3\\cdot 10^{-14}$ ] erg / s/@xmath2 ( corresponding to the luminosity 10@xmath40erg / s at the smc distance ) is 151 . with account for the survey incompleteness ( eq .  [ eq : lc ] )",
    "this number corresponds to @xmath41 ( see thick histogram in fig .  [",
    "fig : lf0 ] ) . according to the cxb @xmath42 determined by @xcite ,",
    "the total number of cxb sources expected in the field of 1.48 deg@xmath38 is @xmath43 . from the comparison of these numbers it is obvious that about 3/4 of sources in our sample are background agns .",
    "a significantly less important source of contamination is x - ray sources associated with foreground stars in the galaxy ( no known galactic x - ray binaries were located in the field of view of xmm observations ) .",
    "foreground stars are removed by our filtering procedure , as described in section  [ sec : ident ] .      given the limiting sensitivity of the survey , @xmath44 erg / s/@xmath2 , corresponding to the luminosity @xmath45 erg / s at the smc distance , the intrinsic smc sources are dominated by x - ray binaries .",

    "the discussion of results of different star formation indicators could be also found in @xcite ( see also discussion of the sfr in the lmc by @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite based on isophot observations and calibration of @xcite obtained the star formation rate in the smc sfr(ir)=0.015@xmath55yr .",
    "@xcite , however , noted that this value underestimates the sfr of the smc because some stellar radiation , due to low opacity of the smc , can escape the star formation regions directly , and gave a more realistic estimate of @xmath56 with the total infrared luminosity of the smc @xcite l@xmath57erg / s and using the equation ( 5 ) from @xcite which accounts for the uncertainty mentioned above , we obtained @xmath58 note , that this calibration should be applied extremely cautious for such a low - luminosity galaxy @xcite .",

    "we obtain with the @xcite calibration @xmath62 this value is consistent with the sfr(uv ) derived from flux corrected for both foreground and internal extinction @xcite : @xmath63    @xcite , from comparison of discrete radio ( parkes telescope ) and x - ray ( rosat ) sources , estimated a number of snrs in the smc ( 14 ) . from the age ",

    "the `` standart '' indicators ( ir , uv , h@xmath6 ) result in the rather low value of @xmath69 m@xmath52/yr , whereas the estimates based on the radio supernova rate and the analysis of the color - magnitude diagram point towards much larger star formation rates , in the @xmath70 m@xmath52/yr range .",
    "we note , that the methods based on the analysis of the color - magnitude diagrams are generally believed to be the most reliable and accurate . as the controversy between different sfr indicators",
    "can not be resolved at present , we shall assume in the following that the true value of sfr is somewhere in the range : @xmath71      for the star formation rate of sfr=@xmath72 yr@xmath73 , using hmxb - sfr relation of @xcite ( see also the discussion of the normalization in the hmxb - sfr calibration by * ? ? ?",

    "number accounts for uncertainty of the sfr estimate and does not include the poisson fluctuations .",
    "as demonstrated above , the population of compact x  ray sources in the smc field is dominated by two types of sources  background agn and high mass x - ray binaries in the smc .",
    "their log(n)log(s ) distributions in the flux range of interest can be described by a power law with the differential slopes @xmath84 ( cxb ) and @xmath10 ( hmxbs ) . due to significant difference in the slopes ,",
    "their relative contributions depend strongly on the flux . at large fluxes , @xmath85 erg / s/@xmath2 ( @xmath53 erg / s ) the x - ray binaries in the smc prevail . on the contrary , in the low flux limit ,",
    "e.g. near the sensitivity limit of our survey , @xmath86 erg / s/@xmath2 , the majority ( @xmath5 ) of the x - ray sources are background agn .",

    "the corrected log(n)log(s ) distribution agrees at low fluxes with that of cxb sources . at high fluxes",
    ", there is an apparent excess of sources above the numbers predicted by the cxb sources log(n)log(s ) , due to the contribution of hmxbs .",
    "to filter out contaminating background and foreground sources , we use the same filtering procedure as described by @xcite .",
    "it is based on the fact that optical emission from hmxbs is dominated by their optical companions , whose properties , such as absolute magnitudes and intrinsic colors are sufficiently well known .",
    "high mass x - ray binaries are powered by accretion of mass lost from the massive early - type optical companion .",
    "the mechanism of accretion could be connected either to ( i ) strong stellar wind from an ob supergiant ( or bright giant ) or ( ii ) equatorial circumstellar disk around oe or be type star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of small magellanic cloud where the only supergiant system smc x-1 is known at present time , the hmxbs with be companion seem to give the main contribution @xcite",
    ".    given the large number of well known high mass x - ray binaries in the smc , the selection criteria for the optical counterparts of such systems can be determined straightforwardly .",
    "for example , @xcite studied the optical properties of be / x - ray pulsars in the smc .",
    "the majority of hmxbs with identified optical companions in their sample ( 32 out of 34 ) have apparent v - band magnitudes m@xmath87 .",
    "the exceptions are supergiant system smc x-1 with m@xmath88 and x - ray pulsar cxou j010042.8721132 with m@xmath89 ( ogle catalogue * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which has been previously classified by @xcite as a possible anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ) .",
    "this picture is consistent with the expectations based on the positions of possible optical counterparts on the hertzsprung - russel diagram , distance modulus of the smc , @xmath90 @xcite , and foreground and intrinsic extinction towards the smc , a@xmath91 ( for hot population ) @xcite .",
    "ob supergiants and bright giants ( luminosity classes i  ii ) have absolute magnitudes m@xmath92 , corresponding to apparent magnitudes in the range m@xmath93 .",
    "the position of be stars in the h ",
    "r diagram is close to the main sequence .",
    "apparent magnitudes m@xmath94 correspond to spectral classes earlier than b3b5 for main sequence stars ( b5b7 for giants ) .",
    "thus we can conclude , that hmxbs in the smc with main sequence be optical companions have spectral classes earlier than b3b5 ( b5b7 for giants ) , in agreement with expectations based on the optical properties of hmxbs in our galaxy .    as potential optical counterparts of hmxbs belong to spectral classes earlier than @xmath7 b3b5 , their intrinsic optical and near - infrared colors",
    "are constrained by @xmath95 , @xmath96 . with account for the interstellar reddening",
    ", both apparent colors are expected to be @xmath97 .",
    "this is consistent with b - v colors of hmxbs from @xcite sample .",
    "in infrared part of the spectrum , however , be stars are known to exhibit an infrared continuum excess , caused by free - free and free - bound emission within the disk @xcite .",
    "therefore , j  k colors of",
    "be stars can be higher than values qouted above . to avoid this uncertainty , in identification procedure we use mainly",
    "b  v colors , applying j  k identification criteria only in extreme cases ( in fact we used this criteria alone only for one source ) .",
    "we used the following optical and near - infrared catalogs :    1 .",

    "the color limits are higher than possible colors of hmxbs optical companions ( b  v@xmath1010.1 - 0.2 ) and were chosen to account for limited photometric accuracy of optical catalogues .",

    "below we consider the problem of cross - corellation of two catalogs ( e.g. of the list of detected x - ray sources and an optical catalogue ) .",
    "more specifically we concentrated on the case when only a fraction of x - ray sources has true optical counterparts in the optical catalogue and when the probability of chance coincidences is not negligible . in this case , the matches of x - ray sources with optical sources will include real optical counterparts and chance coincidences .",
    "we consider the behavior of the growth curves  the dependence of the number of matches on the search radius .",
    "we show that using different dependences of the number of true matches and chance coincidences on the search radius , it is possible to estimate the number of true optical counterparts .      the number of x - ray sources with optical matches inside radius r depends on the number of x - ray sources which have true optical counterpart inside r and number of chance coincidences of x - ray sources with field stars : @xmath206 where n - total number of x - ray sources , m - number of x - ray sources with true optical counterparts , @xmath207 - density of optical field stars ( i.e. excluding the true optical counterparts ) and @xmath208 is the distribution of distances between x - ray sources and their optical counterparts . the first term in the above equation is a number of chance coincidences , i.e. number of x - ray sources which have at least one field star inside its search radius .",
    "the second term corresponds to number of true matches falling inside search radius r. the exponent in this term excludes cases when both true optical counterpart and chance coincidence with field stars are present , as such matches were already taken into account in the first term . assuming that all x - ray sources have the same positional error @xmath110 ( hence @xmath209 ) , we can rewrite this equation in the following way : @xmath210 fitting the curve n@xmath211(r ) with this formula one can determine the number of x - ray sources with true optical matches , surface density of optical stars @xmath207 and error on the source positions .      in a real situation ,",
    "the density of optical stars @xmath207 varies from field to field and even from source to source .",
    "this can lead to significant deviations of n@xmath211(r ) curve behaviour from the eq .",
    "[ eq : appendix2 ] .",
    "there is no obvious way to overcome this problem completely .",
    "however , the density variations could be partially taken into account by replacing the mean density of optical objects in the first term of eq .",
    "[ eq : appendix2 ] by the local densities of optical objects around each individual x - ray source . the first term in this case , of course , should be replaced by the corresponding sum over all x - ray sources .",
    "the density @xmath207 in the second term , however , can not be straightforwardly calculated because it is related to x - ray sources with true optical counterparts , which we do not know a priori .",
    "thus , modifying the first term in equation [ eq : appendix2 ] we obtain : @xmath212 the local densities @xmath213 of optical objects should be calculated individually for each x - ray source .",
    "the areas over which these densities are calculated must be large enough to minimize the relative contribution of the true optical counterparts and poissonian errors .",
    "density @xmath207 corresponds now to the mean density of optical objects near x - ray sources which have true optical counterparts .",
    "fit parameters are the number of x - ray sources with true optical matches m , the value of positional error @xmath110 and the mean density of optical objects @xmath207 .",
    "fitting the n@xmath211(r ) curve using real list of xmm sources and optical sources from the mcps catalogue we obtain the best fit value for the total number of sources with true optical counterpart in our sample is @xmath214 , surprisingly close to the number of our likely hmxb candidates ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nmatch2 ] ) .",
    "best fit value of positional error , @xmath215 , also agrees with typical values for x - ray sources from our list ranging from @xmath216 to @xmath217 .",
    "we note also , that from the eq .",
    "[ eq : appendix3 ] it follows that subtracting the first sum from @xmath218 curve and multiplying the remaining part by @xmath219 , we can obtain the dependence of the number of true counterparts among optical matches on the search radius .",
    "the resulting curve is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : nmatch ] .",
    "it is clear from this figure , that almost all true optical counterparts of x - ray sources will be detected with the search radius of 4@xmath98 used in our hmxb identification procedure .    .",
    "the individual components of this equation corresponding to spurious matches with field stars and true optical counterparts ( which do nt have simultaneous spurious matches ) are shown with dashed and dot - dashed lines respectively . ,",
    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]     ( see  [ sec : appvardens ] ) .",
    "the vertical dashed line shows the search radius of @xmath220 arcsec .",
    "it is clear from this figure , that almost all true optical counterparts of x - ray sources fall within the chosen search radius.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      the deviation of positional errors distribution from the delta function together with the astrometric uncertainty can also modify n@xmath211(r ) curve . with the spread in positional errors accounted for ,",
    "the equation  [ eq : appendix3 ] becomes :      where @xmath222 is the ( gaussian ) distribution of distances between the x - ray and optical sources for given @xmath110 and @xmath223 is a distribution of positional uncertainties of x - ray sources . to show that such a spread will not significantly change our results",
    ", we assumed that errors distribution follows the power law @xmath224 between @xmath225 and @xmath226 . in this case",
