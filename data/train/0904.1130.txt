    "relativistic mean - field models have been widely accepted as a successful tool for the theoretical description of different nuclear systems such as nuclear matter , finite nuclei and heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the major advantage of relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models has been a novel description of the saturation mechanism and an explanation of the strong spin - orbit force .",
    "an energy dependence of the schrdinger equivalent optical potential @xcite is naturally included as a consequence of a relativistic description .    the common starting basis for rmf models is the relativistic hadrodynamics ( rhd ) with interacting hadrons , i.e. , nucleons and mesons , as the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "starting from the pioneering work of duerr @xcite , simple lagrangians have been introduced @xcite , and since then many different extensions and treatments have evolved . the lagrangian of rhd can be treated in different approximations .",
    "for a practical application to nuclear matter and finite nuclei one usually employs the mean - field approximation . in this approach",
    "the nucleon selfenergies become simple functions of various nucleon densities , but do not explicitly depend on energy or momentum of the nucleon . as a consequence a linear energy dependence of the optical potential arises . in principle",
    ", one can go beyond the mean - field approximation in a quantum field theoretical treatment by a systematic diagrammatic expansion . in this case , the nucleon selfenergies show a much more complicated structure that takes the non - trivial effects of the nuclear medium into account . in dirac - brueckner ( db )",
    "calculations of nuclear matter based on a given nucleon - nucleon interaction it is possible to extract the corresponding nucleon selfenergies @xcite .",
    "they depend on both the density of the nuclear medium and the energy and momentum of the nucleon .",
    "they reproduce the empirical saturation point of nuclear matter as well as the energy dependence of the optical potential for energies up to @xmath0 mev",
    ".    however , for practical applications the db approach is not suitable due to its high complexity and its apparent limitations at high energies and densities .",
    "thus , as an alternative approach to these _ ab - initio _",
    "strategies for the nuclear many - body system a phenomenological treatment of the problem in the spirit of the mean - field approximation has been established .",
    "the basic lagrangian of rhd has to be modified for a quantitative description of static nuclear systems such as nuclear matter and/or finite nuclei .",
    "therefore , it becomes mandatory to introduce new terms , e.g. , including non - linear selfinteractions of the scalar @xcite and vector @xcite meson fields , or to modify existing contributions in the lagrangian , e.g. , introducing density dependent meson - nucleon couplings @xcite .",
    "the model parameters have to be fitted to properties of nuclear matter and/or atomic nuclei , since they can not be derived in a simple manner from a microscopic description . for a quantitative description of dynamical systems ,",
    "e.g. , hadron- and heavy - ion - induced reactions , the energy and momentum dependence of the nuclear mean - field becomes important . in conventional rmf models the meson - nucleon couplings are independent of the nucleon energy and momentum .",
    "this leads to a linear energy dependence of the schrdinger equivalent optical potential with an unrealistically divergent behaviour at high energies .",
    "indeed , analyses of proton - nucleus scattering data @xcite show that the proton - nucleus optical potential levels off at proton energies of about @xmath1 mev .",
    "thus , alternative rmf approaches have been developed by including additional non - local contributions , i.e. , by introducing fock - terms , on the level of the rmf selfenergies leading to a density and energy dependence @xcite .",
    "however , such a treatment is not covariant and also its numerical realization in actual transport calculations is difficult @xcite .",
    "another approach has been proposed in @xcite and more recently in @xcite by introducing linear order derivative couplings in the lagrangian of rhd .",
    "these additional terms lead to an energy ( or momentum ) dependence of a nucleon inside the nuclear matter , and modify also the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "zimanyi and moszkowski @xcite studied such gradient terms with the conclusion of a softening of the nuclear eos . a more detailed study by typel @xcite involved the investigation of both , the density dependence of the nuclear eos and the energy dependence of the optical potential . while _ linear _ derivative interactions of meson fields with nucleons explain the empirical energy dependence of the optical potential , a soft eos results from an introduction of an explicit density dependence of the nucleon - meson couplings with additional parameters .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to develop a covariant model , which generates both , the correct density and momentum dependence of the selfenergies in an unified framework .",
    "furthermore , we find that the density and the momentum dependencies are indispensable and strongly correlated .",
    "the model proposed here is simple in realization and respects all the underlying symmetries of the rhd lagrangian .",
    "the approach followed here is to extend the original lagrangian of rhd @xcite by including _ non - linear _ derivative interactions of meson fields with nucleons .",
    "we refer it to as non - linear derivative ( nld ) model , and it is presented in the section 2 .",
    "the nld lagrangian ( section [ sec2 ] ) contains not only the nucleon spinor and its first derivative , but it depends on all higher order derivatives of the nucleon field . as a consequence ,",
    "the standard canonical formalism has to be generalized ( section [ subsec3 ] ) .",
    "field equations for nucleons and meson fields can be then derived ( section [ subsec4 ] ) .",
    "the nld model gives field equations with very simple structure in nuclear matter ( section [ sec3 ] ) with density and energy dependent nucleon selfenergies .",
    "as a major advantage , both the equation of state ( eos ) ( density dependence ) and the optical potential ( energy dependence ) are quantitatively well reproduced with a single parameter and the results are comparable with microscopic db models , as in detailed discussed in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec5 ] , conclusions and an outlook complete the paper .",
    "this section describes the details of the formalism . in the first subsection",

    "are investigated , before the euler - lagrange equations for the relevant degrees of freedom are formulated .",
