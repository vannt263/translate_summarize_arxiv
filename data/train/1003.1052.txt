    "one of the main objectives of _ nonequilibrium thermodynamics _ is the study of the response of physical systems to applied external perturbations . around the mid of the last century",
    "major advancements were obtained in this field with the development of linear response theory by several authors , among which we mention @xcite .",
    "this theory , inspired by the works of @xcite on the brownian movement and of @xcite and @xcite on noise in electrical circuits , established that , under certain circumstances , the linear response to small perturbations is determined by the equilibrium fluctuations of the system .",
    "in particular , the linear response coefficients are proportional to two - point correlation functions for hamiltonian systems @xcite as well as for stochastic , generally non - equilibrium systems @xcite . in principle",
    ", an infinite hierarchy of higher order fluctuation - dissipation relations connects the @xmath3-th order response coefficients to @xmath4-point correlation functions .",
    "in contrast , fluctuation theorems are compact relations that provide information about the fully _ nonlinear response_. accordingly , fluctuation - dissipation relations of all orders can be derived therefrom .",
    "@xcite were the first to put forward one such fully nonlinear fluctuation theorem .",
    "these authors noticed that , for a _ classical _ system , their general fluctuation theorem implies the following , extremely simple nonequilibrium identity : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the work done on the system by the external perturbation during one specific realization thereof , @xmath7 denotes the average over many realizations of the same perturbation , and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the initial temperature of the system and @xmath10 boltzmann s constant . due to the properties of convexity of the exponential function ,",
    "an almost immediate consequence of ( [ eq : bke ] ) , is the second law of thermodynamics in the form , @xmath11 ; i.e. when a system is perturbed from an initial thermal equilibrium , on average , it can only absorb energy .",
    "the works of @xcite has recently re - gained a great deal of attention , after @xcite derived , within the framework of classical mechanics , a salient result similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : bke ] ) : @xmath12 which , in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ eq : bke ] ) , allows to extract an equilibrium property of the system , i.e. , its free energy ( difference ) @xmath13 , from nonequilibrium fluctuations of work @xmath14 .",
    "evidently , the definitions of work adopted by @xcite and @xcite ( denoted here respectively as @xmath14 and @xmath6 ) do not coincide .",
    "the relationships between these two work definitions and the corresponding nonequilibrium identities , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bke],[eq : je ] ) , were discussed in a very clear and elucidating manner in @xcite , which , for the sake of clarity , we summarize below .",
    "let us express the time dependent hamiltonian of the driven classical system as the sum of the unperturbed system hamiltonian @xmath15 and the interaction energy stemming from the coupling of the external time dependent perturbation @xmath16 to a certain system observable @xmath17 : @xmath18 we restrict ourselves to the simplest case of a protocol governed by a single `` field '' @xmath16 coupling to the conjugated generalized coordinate @xmath17 . generalization to several fields @xmath19 coupling to different generalized coordinates @xmath20 is straightforward .",
    "the definition of work @xmath14 according to @xcite stems from an _ inclusive _ viewpoint , where one counts the term @xmath21 as being part of the system internal energy .",
    "in contrast the definition of work @xmath6 according to @xcite belongs to an _ exclusive _ viewpoint where instead , such term is not counted as part of the energy of the system .",
    "more explicitly , if @xmath22 is a certain initial condition that evolves to @xmath23 in a time @xmath24 , according to the hamiltonian evolution generated by @xmath25 , then the two different definitions of work become : @xmath26    it is important to stress that @xcite only obtained eq .",
    "( [ eq : bke ] ) in the _ classical _ case , notwithstanding the fact that they developed a quantum version of their theory , as well .",
    "this difficulty is related to the fact that work was identified by @xcite with the quantum expectation of a pretended _ work operator _ , given by the difference of final and initial hamiltonian in the heisenberg representation . to be more clear , if the quantum hamiltonian reads : @xmath27 where now @xmath28 and @xmath29 are hermitian operators , the work operator was defined by @xcite as : , where @xmath30 is the operator @xmath17 in the heisenberg representation .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that @xmath31 coincides with @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : work - op - ex ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath32 where the superscript @xmath25 denotes heisenberg picture .",
    "a similar approach was employed also within the inclusive viewpoint , with work defined as @xcite @xmath33 as pointed out clearly by some of us before with the work in @xcite the jarzynski equality ( [ eq : je ] ) _ can not _ be obtained on the basis of the work operator ( [ eq : work - op - in ] ) . likewise the bochkov - kuzovlev identity ( [ eq : bke ] ) can not be obtained on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ eq : work - op - ex ] ) .",
    "it is by now clear that the impossibility of extending the classical results ( [ eq : bke],[eq : je ] ) on the basis of quantum work operators ( [ eq : work - op - ex],[eq : work - op - in ] ) , respectively , is related to the fact that work characterizes a process , rather than a state of the system , and consequently can not be represented by an observable that would yield work as the result of a single projective measurement . in contrast , energy must be measured twice in order to determine work , once before the protocol starts and a second time immediately after it has ended .",
    "the difference of the outcomes of these two measurements then yields the work performed on the system in a particular realization @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will adopt the exclusive viewpoint of @xcite , but use the proper definition of work as the difference between the outcomes of two projective measurements of @xmath15 , to obtain the quantum version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bke ] ) .",
    "indeed we will develop the theory of quantum work fluctuations within the exclusive two - point measurements viewpoint in great generality . in sec .",

    "[ sec : can ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : mu - can ] we derive the exclusive versions of the tasaki - crooks quantum fluctuation theorem @xcite , and of the microcanonical quantum fluctuation theorem @xcite , respectively . sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] closes the paper with some remarks concerning the relationships between the inclusive - work , the exclusive - work , and the dissipated - work .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , work is properly defined in quantum mechanics as the difference of the energies measured at the beginning and end of the protocol , i.e. , at times @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . according to the exclusive viewpoint that we adopt here ,",
    "this energy is given by the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 , denote the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath15 : @xmath38 here @xmath3 is the quantum number labeling the eigenvalues of @xmath15 and @xmath39 denotes further quantum numbers needed to specify uniquely the state of the system , in case of degenerate energies .",
    "a measurement of @xmath15 at time @xmath34 gives a certain eigenvalue @xmath40 while a subsequent measurement of @xmath15 at time @xmath41 gives another eigenvalue @xmath42 , so that @xmath43 evidently @xmath1 is a stochastic variable due to the intrinsic randomness entailed in the quantum measurement processes and possibly in the statistical mixture nature of the initial preparation . in the following",
    "we derive the statistical properties of @xmath1 , in terms of its probability density function ( pdf ) , and the associated characteristic function of work .",
    "let the system be prepared at time @xmath44 in a certain state described by the density matrix @xmath45 .",
    "we further assume that the perturbation @xmath16 is switched on at time @xmath34 . at the same time the first measurement of @xmath15",
    "is performed , with outcome @xmath40 .",
    "this occurs with probability : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the projector onto the eigenspace spanned by the eigenvectors belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath40 : @xmath48 and @xmath49 denotes trace over the hilbert space . according to the postulates of quantum mechanics , immediately after the measurement",

    "the same symbols , without the superscript @xmath57 denote the respective quantities within the inclusive viewpoint .",
    "the fourier transform of the probability density of work gives the characteristic function of work @xmath58 which allows quick derivations of fluctuation theorems and nonequilibrium equalities .",
    "performing calculations analogous to those reported by @xcite we find the characteristic function of work , in the form of a two point _ quantum correlation function _ : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is defined as : @xmath61 and the superscript @xmath25 stands for heisenberg representation , i.e. : @xmath62 this exclusive - work characteristic function @xmath63 should be compared to the inclusive - work characteristic function @xmath64 that is obtained when looking at the difference @xmath0 of the outcomes @xmath65 and @xmath66 of measurements of the _ total _ time dependent hamiltonian @xmath67 . in this case one",

    "consider next the reversed protocol @xmath71 which consecutively assumes values as if time was reversed .",
    "let @xmath72 be the resulting hamiltonian : @xmath73 the characteristic function of work now reads : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the time evolution operator generated by @xmath72 : @xmath77 assuming that the hamiltonian @xmath67 is invariant under time reversal i.e. , ) , see @xcite . ] @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the antiunitary time reversal operator @xcite , the time evolution operators associated to the forward and backward protocols are related by the following important relation , see [ app : theta ] : @xmath80 in the following section we will derive the quantum version of eq .
