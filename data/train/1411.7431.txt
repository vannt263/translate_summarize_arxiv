    "the collapse and revival in the population dynamics of the atom - cavity coupled system under the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) is an important issue in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the collapse is attributed to the destructive interference among various transitions between the atomic upper and lower levels , and the revival is due to quantized nature of the photonic number states in the cavity .",
    "the collapse and revival phenomenon was first predicted by eberly _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and was observed experimentally by rempe _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the rwa is a very good approximation if the atom - cavity interaction energy is much smaller than the characteristic energy of the atom - cavity coupled system , i.e. , if the ratio of the coupling constant and the field frequency , @xmath0 , is much less than unity , a parameter space often refereed to as the weak coupling regime . if the coupling constant",
    "is comparable to the field frequency , i.e. , @xmath1 , also known as the ultra - strong coupling regime , the counter - rotating terms ( crts ) have to be considered .",
    "the effect of the crts on the dynamics of the atomic population inversion has been studied in the weak coupling regime @xcite as well as the deep strong coupling regime with @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "et al . _  examined the full range of atom - cavity coupling finding that the collapse and revival gradually disappear and reemerge periodically as the coupling strength increases in the strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "numerically exact calculations reveal that the collapse and revival gradually loses prominence as the coupling is increased , and vanish in the ultra - strong coupling regime .",
    "however , due to the lack of an analytical apparatus analogous to rwa , an in - depth understanding remains elusive on the dynamics of atomic population inversion from the weak to the ultra - strong coupling regime ( @xmath3 ) .    for superconducting qubits , a one - dimensional transmission - line resonator , or an lc circuit @xcite can play the role of the cavity ,",
    "also known as the circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) systems .",
    "recently , an lc resonator inductively coupled to a superconducting qubit  @xcite has been realized experimentally .",
    "the qubit - resonator coupling @xmath4 has been strengthened to @xmath5 , entering the ultra - strong coupling regime , and evidence for the breakdown of the rwa has been provided  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the crts can no longer be ignored .",
    "recently , much attention has been devoted to the qubit - oscillator system and the effect of the crts in the ultra - strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "a two - level atom coupled to a single - mode cavity has long been a subject of extensive study , for which two main schemes are usually employed .",
    "one is based on the phontonic fock states as pioneered by swain @xcite , and the other , on various unitary transformations or displaced oscillators @xcite , which are equivalent to extended coherent states @xcite or extended squeezed states  @xcite .",
    "very accurate solutions can be obtained in the latter scheme , but as an infinite number of phontonic fock states are involved , certain important features may be smeared out .",
    "recently , he _",
    "et al . _",
    "proposed a method of using only the dominant parts in swain s wave function @xcite in the corrections to the rwa .",
    "the effect of the crts emerges clearly even in the first - order correction .",
    "all eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are derived analytically .",
    "the vacuum rabi splitting has been obtained successfully up to the remarkable coupling strength of @xmath6 , suggesting that they could be convincingly applied to recent circuit qed systems operating in the ultra - strong coupling regime . in this work ,",
    "we show that this method can be improved further with easy - to - use eigenvalues and eigenvectors similar to those in the rwa , and the atomic population inversion from an initial field of coherent states can then be studied in great detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we show an improved version of the first correction to the rwa , and give all eigensolutions similar as those in rwa . in section iii , the atomic population inversion is calculated analytically .",
    "the origin of the absence of the collapse up to the ultra - strong coupling regime is examined in detail .",
    "the structure of the exact power spectrum is discussed in terms of the corrections to the rwa and the numerical exact energy levels .",
    "a brief summary is given in section iv .",

    "here we define @xmath16 as the detuning parameter , and focus on the resonance case of @xmath17 .",
    "the frequency of the cavity mode is set to unity as the energy scale , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "the rwa neglects the crts , @xmath19 , rendering the hamiltonian diagonalizable with the eigenfunctions  @xcite @xmath20 and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath21 where @xmath22  is the atomic quantum number , and @xmath23 is the photonic quantum number . throughout this appear , @xmath24 and",

    "the first correction to the rwa wave function is to add a new photonic state @xmath26 to the upper atomic level so that the wave function can be written as @xmath27 from the rwa results , we note that an odd quantum number @xmath24 is for even parity , and an even @xmath24 for odd parity , resulting in a single univariate cubic equation @xmath28 e\\ ] ] @xmath29 which is the same as eq .",

    "it will be demonstrated that the crwa expansions are exact up to @xmath45 ( @xmath10 ) in energy ( wave function ) .",

    "for example , for @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "it is understood that orthogonality is only observed in the weak coupling limit .    following the standard procedure ,",
    "we can also obtain the ground state ( gs ) and its energy by adding one new bare state to the rwa one @xmath48 as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 this gs eigenvector is regarded as the crwa one , because only one new phontonic state is added , analogous to the crwa excited states .",

    "the gs eigenvectors appear to reveal the general property of the excited states with second order corrections , for which analytical expressions are elusive .",
    "crwa may not yield more accurate results than many other approaches involving infinitely many photon states .",
    "the advantage , instead , lies in the transparency in important mechanisms of interest provided by the compact eigenstates with only three photonic number states .",
