    "in this paper we continue our study of real and virtual photon - proton scattering in a nonperturbative framework which we have initiated in @xcite , hereafter referred to as i. sections of that paper will be referred to as i.2.1 and equations as ( i.1 ) etc .",
    "we use the same notation and conventions as in i , and definitions made there will not be repeated here . in the present paper",
    "we include only references that are directly relevant to the material treated here , for a more extensive list of references we refer the reader to i.    in the first paper we have classified the contributions to the process of real or virtual photon - proton scattering , see section i.2.1 , figure i.2 .",
    "we have identified the leading contributions at high energies in sect .",
    "i.2.2 and have derived expressions for them which take into account the renormalisation of the photon - quark - antiquark vertex . in the present paper we study in detail the high energy limit .",
    "we investigate the approximations and assumptions that are necessary to derive the dipole model of high energy scattering from the results obtained in the first paper .",
    "we point out that the naive dipole model formula should be supplemented by two additional terms which can potentially become large at small photon virtualities .",
    "gauge invariance is known to place strong constraints on current - induced scattering amplitudes .",
    "we find it therefore interesting to study the gauge invariance of different contributions to the scattering amplitude .",
    "it turns out that at finite energies the part of the compton amplitude from which the dipole picture emerges is not gauge invariant separately .",
    "this also leads to subtleties in the definition of the wave function of longitudinally polarised photons which we discuss in some detail .    as a key result of the present paper",
    "we identify the assumptions and approximations that lead us from the most general description of the compton amplitude to the usual dipole picture .",
    "we consider it a very important task to test the validity of those assumptions and approximations for the experimentally accessible ranges of the kinematic variables . in the dipole picture",
    "the total photon - proton cross section is a convolution of the square of the photon wave function with the reduced cross section describing the scattering of a colour dipole off the proton . at present , the reduced cross section can not be derived from first principles and one has to retreat to models based on ideas like saturation .",
    "one finds that the currently available data permit considerable freedom for models of the reduced cross section . if one is to find phenomenological tests of the dipole picture ( and hence of the assumptions on which it is based ) one should thus concentrate on the other convolution factor in the dipole formula , that is on the photon wave function .",
    "this motivates us to study in some detail the properties of the wave function .    as an immediate consequence of the dipole formula for the total virtual photon - proton cross section we derive a bound on the ratio @xmath6 of the cross sections for longitudinally and transversely polarised photons that results only from the respective photon wave functions .",
    "although there are only few data points available at energies sufficiently high for one reasonably to expect the dipole model to be applicable the bound turns out to give some indication as to the photon virtualities below which the dipole model becomes questionable . in this region",
    "the two additional terms mentioned above should become relevant .",
    "in the dipole picture one talks about a quark - antiquark pair scattering on a target .",
    "if we want to be rigorous we have to face the question how far we can go treating quarks as asymptotic states .",
    "of course , quarks are confined and do not have a mass shell . in this paper",
    "we shall nevertheless assume  as is usually done  that we can treat quarks and antiquarks as asymptotic particles .",
    "as we shall show we can then make a precise connection between the photon induced reaction and the reaction where the photon is replaced by a superposition of quark - antiquark states .",
    "we leave the investigation of the realistic case of quarks which have no mass shell for future work . at present",
    "we may give the following simple argument .",
    "let us assume that the two - point functions for quarks have a kllen - lehmann representation with standard properties , but with no mass shell .",
    "this is indicated by calculations using lattice as well as schwinger - dyson equation methods , see for example @xcite .",
    "we can then think that the mass - distribution function of a quark propagator may have a strong peak at some value @xmath7 which we shall call the quark mass .",
    "if the peak is approximated by a @xmath8-function we have effectively a quark mass shell .",
    "this second paper is organised as follows .",
    "we start by discussing the high energy limit of the parts of the compton amplitude that are leading at high energies and identify their asymptotic behaviour in section [ highenergysect ] . in section [ gaugesect ]",
    "we investigate the separate gauge invariance of different parts of the amplitude .",
    "the derivation of the photon wave function is performed in section [ wavefunctsec ] where we also discuss the gauge non - invariance of this object and its consequences for the choice of the photon polarisation vectors . in section [ sec : genphotons ] we generalise our findings to the case of more general amplitudes with incoming and outgoing photons and define dipole states . in section",
    "[ sec : dippictdis ] we finally obtain the usual dipole picture and identify all underlying assumptions and approximations .",
    "here we also study the properties of the photon wave function . in section [ sec : phencons ] we derive a bound on the ratio of the cross sections for longitudinally and transversely polarised virtual photons that needs to be satisfied if the usual dipole picture is valid , and compare this bound to the available experimental data .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ conclsect ] . in appendix [ appuseful ]",
    "we collect some technical details relevant to the discussion of the high energy limit in sections [ highenergysect ] and [ wavefunctsec ] .",
    "appendix [ appdiffcontgauge ] supplements section [ gaugesect ] with further discussion of the separate gauge invariance of different parts of the compton amplitude which are subleading at high energies .",
    "in this section we shall study the high energy limit of the real or virtual compton amplitude ( i.[2.3 ] ) , @xmath9 with @xmath10 fixed .",
    "our aim is to obtain eventually the usual dipole picture of high energy photon - proton scattering . as was discussed in section i.[sec : relsize ] in the high energy limit the two amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 give the leading contribution to the full amplitude .",
    "however , it is only the amplitude @xmath11 from which we expect the usual dipole picture to emerge . in the present section",
    "we will therefore study mainly that amplitude @xmath11 ( i.[2.8 ] ) , ( i.[2.20 ] ) .",
    "but it should be kept in mind that at low photon virtuality an important correction to the dipole picture can arise from the amplitude @xmath12 , see the discussion in section i.[sec : relsize ] .",
    "we will mainly be concerned here with the term @xmath13 ( i.[2.33 ] ) of @xmath11 which we will find to be leading in the high energy limit , whereas the terms @xmath14 to @xmath15 are subleading . in the amplitude @xmath13 by definition",
    "only the momentum @xmath16 occurs but not the momenta @xmath17 to @xmath18 which correspond to the other three parts of amplitude @xmath11 , see ( i.[b.20])-(i.[b.23 ] ) .",
    "therefore we now simplify our notation and write @xmath19 instead of @xmath20 and @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 .",
    "let us now consider the term @xmath13 which we have obtained in ( i.[2.33 ] ) in the form @xmath23 and let us in particular concentrate on the integration over @xmath24 in the complex @xmath24-plane . recall that @xmath24 is the off - shell part of the energy of the quark on the left - hand side of the diagram in figure i.[fig4]a , see ( i.[b.3 ] ) .",
    "we expect the matrix element of @xmath25 to be regular in the vicinity of @xmath26 .",
    "thus we have the two explicit pole factors in the integrand ( [ 2.33again ] ) with the poles in @xmath24 situated at @xmath27 and at @xmath28 with [ defdeltae ] e = k^0+k^0-q^0 , see figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "( [ 2.33again ] ) in the @xmath24-plane .",
    "there are poles at @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "[ fig7],width=325 ]    one finds that always @xmath29 .",
    "the poles will contribute a factor of order @xmath30 in the amplitude unless there is a pinching of the two singularities , that is for @xmath31 the conditions for this to happen are easily derived and in principle well known . to make the article self - contained we discuss them here in detail .",
    "we have from ( i.[b.20 ] ) @xmath32 we set @xmath33 where we suppose @xmath34 that is , longitudinal and transverse directions are defined relative to @xmath35 .",
    "we then get @xmath36\\nonumber\\\\ & = & { } ( q^0+k^0+k^{\\prime 0})^{-1 } \\left[q^2 + 2m^2_q+2k^0k^{\\prime 0}-2\\mathbf{k}\\,\\mathbf{k}^{\\prime}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & = & { } 2(q^0+k^0+k^{\\prime 0})^{-1 } \\bigg[\\,\\frac{1}{2}\\,q^2+(\\alpha^2\\mathbf{q}^2+\\mathbf{k}^2_t+m^2_q)^{1/2 }   \\nonumber\\\\ & & { } \\left((1-\\alpha)^2\\mathbf{q}^2+\\mathbf{k}^2_t+m^2_q\\right)^{1/2 } -\\alpha(1-\\alpha)\\mathbf{q}^2+\\mathbf{k}^2_t + m_q^2 \\bigg]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for large @xmath37 the energy difference @xmath38 becomes small only if the terms proportional to @xmath39 in the square brackets cancel .",
    "this happens for @xmath40 if and only if @xmath41 thus we get a pinch and a large contribution only if the splitting of the photon @xmath42 is into a quark - antiquark pair where the longitudinal momenta are both in the direction @xmath35 .",
    "note again that we have used no arguments related to perturbation theory to arrive at this conclusion .",
    "we can rewrite ( [ 3.5 ] ) in yet another form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in figure [ fig8 ] we show the range in @xmath45 corresponding to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is some chosen fixed mass scale for which we always suppose @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "corresponding to @xmath50*k*@xmath51 ( see ( [ 3.11 ] ) , ( [ 3.12 ] ) ) .",
    "[ fig8],width=302 ]    we see that ( [ 3.10 ] ) corresponds to @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and to @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "thus the pinch condition in the form @xmath57 is only fulfilled for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for very small @xmath45 whereas for @xmath60 ranges up to @xmath61 .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in appendix [ appiiapinch ] .",
    "taking now only the contribution from the pinch in ( [ 2.33again ] ) we obtain asymptotically for large @xmath37 @xmath62 here the four - momenta @xmath63 are given as in ( [ 3.2 ] ) and ( [ 3.3 ] ) with @xmath49 .",
    "we have inserted a @xmath64-function to ensure the pinch condition in the form ( [ 3.13 ] ) .",
    "this limits @xmath65 as shown in figure [ fig8 ] ; see also the discussion in appendix [ appiiapinch ] .",
    "we note that in @xmath14 to @xmath15 , ( i.[2.23])-(i.[2.25 ] ) , no pinch of the explicit pole terms in @xmath24 occurs and we expect these terms to be suppressed relative to the leading term ( [ 3.14 ] ) by a factor of the order @xmath66 for large @xmath37 .",
    "in ( [ 3.14 ] ) we already see something like the dipole picture emerging .",
    "the photon splits into a @xmath67 pair with both the quark and the antiquark on the mass shell @xmath7 .",
    "this on - shell pair interacts with the proton to produce the final state .",
    "but the photon ` wave function ' is not simply the vertex function .",
    "there is also the piece containing the kernel @xmath68 which in a way represents rescattering corrections of the @xmath67-pair .",
    "we should keep in mind also the contribution from the amplitude @xmath12 . in complete analogy to the discussion above we start from ( i.[2.45 ] ) and find a pinch singularity also for that amplitude .",
    "the leading term in @xmath12 for large @xmath37 then asymptotically becomes @xmath69    the discussion of the high energy limit presented here is consistent with the well - known space - time picture of photon - hadron scattering at high energies that is the origin of the dipole picture .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 is the energy imbalance between the photon and the quark - antiquark pair , see ( [ defdeltae ] ) .",
    "according to the energy - time uncertainty relation the quark - antiquark pair into which the photon fluctuates can therefore live at most for a time @xmath70 . in the high energy limit we have @xmath71 ( for fixed @xmath10 ) such that the maximal lifetime of the pair increases with increasing energy . in the rest frame of the proton ,",
    "for example , the photon typically splits into the quark - antiquark pair already at a large distance from the proton .",
    "the actual interaction of the pair with the proton then takes place on much shorter timescales .",
    "some typical values of @xmath38 in realistic situations are given in appendix [ appuseful ] .    in order to extract the dipole picture explicitly from the formulae obtained above it will turn out to be useful to address first the problem of gauge invariance of various parts of the amplitude .",
    "in this section we want to study the question of electromagnetic gauge invariance of the real or virtual compton amplitude .",
    "in particular we are interested in the question whether the different parts of the amplitude arising from the decompositions that we have performed up to this point are separately gauge invariant . in the following",
    "we will therefore consider the general amplitude without imposing the high energy limit . only in section [ subsec : gaugehighenergy ]",
    "we will come back to this limit .",
    "the full compton amplitude ( i.[2.3 ] ) obviously exhibits electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "more precisely , electromagnetic current conservation implies [ generalgaugeinv ] q_^_s^s(p^,p , q ) = 0 . here and in the following",
    "we always consider current conservation for the incoming photon , hence the contraction with @xmath72 .",
    "the outgoing photon can be treated analogously .",
    "we first consider the general decomposition of the amplitude derived in section i.[nonpertsect ] and do not yet impose the high energy limit .",
    "again we are in particular interested in the contributions @xmath11 and @xmath12 represented by figures i.[fig2]a and i.[fig2]b , which are not suppressed at high energies .",
    "let us first consider the contribution @xmath11 , that is the term from which the usual dipole picture emerges at high energies , as we will see in the following sections .",
    "we start from expression ( i.[2.8 ] ) in which we recognise that the @xmath42-dependence of @xmath11 is fully contained in the term @xmath73 given in ( i.[2.8a ] ) .",
    "we therefore consider the expression [ qtimesaa ] q_a^(q)(q ) & = & d^4 x ( q_e^-iqx ) + & = & d^4 x ( i e^-iqx ) + & = & - d^4 x e^-iqx i , where we have integrated by parts .",
    "this contains the following expression , in which we can complete the derivatives to full covariant derivatives in order to obtain inverse quark propagators , [ qnuacontr ] + & = & + & = & \\ { ^s_f^(q)(0,x;g ) s_f^(q)(x,0;g ) } . inserting this back in ( [ qtimesaa ] ) we obtain with ( i.[a.4 ] ) and ( i.[a.4b ] )",
    "q_a^(q)(q ) & = & - d^4 x e^-iqx + & = & 0 . consequently",
    ", the amplitude @xmath11 is separately gauge invariant , [ magaugeinv ] q_^(a ) _",
    "s^s(p^,p , q ) = 0 .",
    "next we turn to the amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "the factor in that amplitude which is relevant for our considerations here is according to ( i.[mbexpl ] ) given by @xmath74 , see ( i.[c.3 ] ) .",
    "its contraction with @xmath72 gives [ abpartial ] q_a_b^(q)(q ) & = & q_d^4x e^-iqx + & = & - d^4x e^-iqx i , where we have again integrated by parts .",
    "the derivative of the trace then becomes [ derivtracemb ] i & = & + & = & .",
    "|_x=x here we can again complete full covariant derivatives and obtain for ( [ abpartial ] ) with ( i.[a.4 ] ) and ( i.[a.4b ] ) [ fullcovderinmb ] q_a_b^(q)(q ) & = & - d^4x e^-iqx |_x=x + & = & .",
    "d^4x e^-iqx |_x=x + & = & 0 . hence also the amplitude @xmath12 is separately gauge invariant , [ mbgaugeinv ] q_^(b ) _",
    "s^s(p^,p , q ) = 0 .",
    "finally we consider the remaining parts of the amplitude in the skeleton decomposition , @xmath75 ",
    "@xmath76 , which are subleading in the high energy limit . here",
    "we find that @xmath75 taken together with @xmath77 is gauge invariant , [ mcdgaugeinv ] q _",
    "( ^(c ) _ s^s(p^,p , q ) + ^(d ) _",
    "s^s(p^,p , q ) ) = 0 , whereas each of the remaining three amplitudes @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath76 is gauge invariant by itself , [ mefggaugeinv ]",
    "q_^(e ) _ s^s(p^,p , q ) = q_^(f ) _ s^s(p^,p , q ) = q_^(g ) _",
    "s^s(p^,p , q ) = 0 .",
    "the derivation of these results is presented in appendix [ appdiffcontgauge ] .      among the contributions to the skeleton decomposition of the full amplitude",
    "we have identified @xmath11 and @xmath12 as the ones that will be leading at high energies .",
    "we now turn to the spin sum decomposition which we have performed for these two amplitudes . at this point we still consider the general decomposition of these amplitudes performed before taking the high energy limit .",
    "we have decomposed @xmath11 into the four terms @xmath82 , @xmath83 , see ( i.[2.20])-(i.[2.25 ] ) and the graphical illustration in figure i.[fig4 ] .",
    "according to ( [ magaugeinv ] ) we clearly have q__j=1 ^ 4 ^(a , j ) _",
    "s^s(p^,p , q ) = 0 .",
    "since we have obtained the dipole picture only from @xmath13 , it is now interesting to see whether that part is gauge invariant by itself .",
    "we use the expression ( [ 2.33again ] ) for @xmath13 and remember that the terms in curly brackets in that equation equal @xmath84 via ( i.[2.31 ] ) . hence the contraction @xmath85 contains as the relevant factor in the integrand the expression [ qzubarv ] q_|u_r(k ) z_q ^v_r^(k ) & = & z_q |u_r(k ) /q",
    "v_r^(k ) + & = & z_q |u_r(k ) v_r^(k ) + & = & - ( e ) z_q |u_r(k ) ^0 v_r^(k ) , where we have used ( [ defdeltae ] ) , ( [ 3.2 ] ) , and that by definition the spinors @xmath86 and @xmath87 are solutions of the free dirac equation , [ freedirac ]    ( /k + m_q ) v_r^(k ) & = & 0 .",
    "clearly , ( [ qzubarv ] ) is in general different from zero . inserting that term back into the full expression ( [ 2.33again ] ) for @xmath13",
    "we thus find that the resulting expression does in general not vanish .",
    "hence the amplitude @xmath13 does in general not fulfil electromagnetic gauge invariance separately .",
    "similar considerations hold for each of the other three terms @xmath82 , @xmath88 , in ( i.[2.20 ] ) .",
    "none of them is gauge invariant separately .",
    "the situation for the spin sum decomposition ( i.[c.11 ] ) of the amplitude @xmath81 into the terms @xmath89 ( @xmath83 ) is completely analogous .",
    "none of the terms @xmath89 given in ( i.[c.13 ] ) - ( i.[c.16 ] ) is gauge invariant by itself .",
    "in particular , the term @xmath90 ( i.[c.14 ] ) gives rise to the same relevant factor ( [ qzubarv ] ) proportional to @xmath38 when contracted with the photon momentum .",
    "finally , we turn to the decomposition of the photon vertex @xmath84 in the amplitude @xmath91 into the renormalised vertex term and the rescattering term , see ( i.[2.31 ] ) and the expression in curly brackets in ( [ 2.33again ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that none of the two contributions to @xmath91 arising from these two terms is gauge invariant separately .",
    "let us consider for example the renormalised vertex term .",
    "contracting @xmath91 of ( [ 2.33again ] ) with @xmath72 the term containing the renormalised vertex gives rise to a factor [ qnurenormvertex ] + & = & |u_r(k ) ( k+k)_^(q ) ( k ,- k ) v_r^(k ) - ( e ) |u_r(k ) ^(q)0 ( k ,- k ) v_r^(k ) + & = & |u_r(k ) v_r^(k ) - ( e ) |u_r(k ) ^(q)0 ( k ,- k ) v_r^(k ) + & = & - ( e )",
    "|u_r(k ) ^(q)0 ( k ,- k ) v_r^(k ) , where we have used the qed ward identity and the dirac equation ( [ freedirac ] ) , and have assumed the existence of a mass shell for quarks , that is @xmath92 .",
    "the remaining expression does not vanish and hence the corresponding term in @xmath91 is not gauge invariant separately .",
    "one can show that also the rescattering term is not gauge invariant separately .",
    "the same considerations hold for the analogous decomposition ( i.[2.31 ] ) of the amplitude @xmath90 as applied in ( i.[2.45 ] ) .",
    "so far we have seen that the amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 are gauge invariant by themselves , but their most interesting parts in the high energy limit , @xmath13 and @xmath93 respectively , are not .",
    "now we want to see what happens to the latter in the high energy limit .",
    "we start with the formula ( [ 3.14 ] ) for @xmath94 in the high energy limit . after contracting that amplitude with @xmath72 the terms in curly brackets together with the two spinors",
    "give exactly the expression ( [ qzubarv ] ) proportional to @xmath38 , and this factor cancels against @xmath70 in ( [ 3.14 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath95 has no @xmath70 enhancement factor and is not of leading order at high energies .",
    "consequently , we have for the ratio [ qnumatoqvecm0 ] = ( ) , where we have chosen the component with @xmath96 in the denominator as a reference for the typical magnitude of the components of @xmath94 . since @xmath97 ( see ( [ deltaelargeq ] ) )",
    "this ratio tends to zero as @xmath98 .",
    "this can be considered an approximate gauge invariance of @xmath94 in the high energy limit in the sense that @xmath95 is suppressed by two powers of @xmath37 compared to the nominal power counting of the two factors of that contraction .",
    "it is a separate question whether @xmath95 itself vanishes in the high energy limit @xmath98 .",
    "that is in general not the case .",
    "we will see this explicitly when we discuss the proper choice for the polarisation vector in the photon wave function for longitudinally polarised photons in section [ sec : longphotons ] below .    by the same argument as just given for @xmath13 also the gauge invariance of @xmath93",
    "is restored asymptotically in the high energy limit , again in the sense that [ qnumbtoqvecm0 ] = ( ) .    finally , we turn to the decomposition ( i.[2.31 ] ) of the photon vertex @xmath84 into renormalised vertex and rescattering term . in ( [ qnurenormvertex ] )",
    "above we have seen that the contraction of the renormalised vertex term with @xmath72 gives rise to an expression proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "we can hence use the same argument as given above for the amplitude @xmath91 : again , the @xmath70 in ( [ 3.14 ] ) is cancelled by the factor @xmath38 from ( [ qnurenormvertex ] ) .",
    "it then immediately follows from ( i.[2.31 ] ) and ( [ qzubarv ] ) that the same happens for the rescattering term .",
    "we conclude that approximate gauge invariance in the sense of ( [ qnumatoqvecm0 ] ) holds separately for the renormalised vertex term and for the rescattering term .",
    "the same conclusions hold also for the corresponding decomposition of the amplitude @xmath90 .",
    "note that the photon - quark - antiquark vertex @xmath84 does not involve any momentum arguments .",
    "however , its separation ( i.[2.31 ] ) into renormalised vertex and rescattering terms makes it necessary to assign momentum arguments for the quark lines in the latter two . in ( [ qnurenormvertex ] )",
    "we have made use of the particular choice ( i.[2.32 ] ) .",
    "other choices for the momentum assignment would have given different results not necessarily giving rise to the separate approximate gauge invariance for the renormalised vertex and the rescattering term in the high energy limit .",
    "therefore the separate approximate gauge invariance of the two terms _ a posteriori _ justifies the momentum assignment ( i.[2.32 ] ) .",
    "in this section we stay in the high energy limit and derive the perturbative photon wave function at leading order from the results obtained above in ( [ 3.14 ] ) and ( [ 3.17 ] ) .",
    "we will do this explicitly starting from the amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "exactly the same steps can be performed also for @xmath12 .    in the following we assume that the photon virtuality is sufficiently large so that we can apply perturbation theory .",
    "we work in the high energy limit and suppose furthermore [ kinlimitalphaq ] || & & |_t| , m_q , + ( 1- ) || & & |_t| , m_q .",
    "this explicitly excludes the end points in longitudinal momentum , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    in leading order of perturbation theory",
    "we have [ 3.16 ] ^(q)=^ , while the rescattering term vanishes in this order , [ kisnull ] k^(q , q)=0 .",
    "we insert this in the leading contribution to the amplitude @xmath11 at high energies as given in ( [ 3.14 ] ) . applying ( [ 3.3 ] )",

    "we have introduced a normalisation factor @xmath102 here which could in principle still be chosen freely at this stage . in order to conform with the usual normalisation of the photon wave function used in the literature",
    "we will pick the choice [ normalizationchoice ] n = - 2 e with the proton charge @xmath103 and the number of colours @xmath104 . note that the freedom in choosing @xmath102 at this stage also involves a dependence on the fractions @xmath105 and @xmath106 of the longitudinal momentum of the photon which are carried by the quark and antiquark , respectively . the particular dependence chosen here",
    "will be motivated later on by the way in which the remaining @xmath107-matrix element is related to dipole matrix elements and in which the latter depend on @xmath105 and @xmath106 , see sections [ sec : realvirtleadingorder ] and [ subsec : dipolepicture ] below .",
    "note further that ( [ defpsischlange ] ) includes the theta function involving the mass scale @xmath47 introduced in section [ highenergysect ] .",
    "we first notice that the function @xmath108 becomes independent of @xmath35 in the high energy limit @xmath98 , see ( [ m2atlargeq ] ) .",

    "we now come to the problem of correctly choosing a polarisation vector for longitudinally polarised photons which we have already mentioned before . while the simplest possible choice for such a polarisation vector is @xmath124 as given by ( [ defepslong ] ) one can easily see that also [ possibleepslong ] ( _ l^ ) = ( _ l^+ ) = e^(0 ) + e^(3 ) describes a longitudinally polarised photon for any real or complex number @xmath125 . indeed ,",
    "since @xmath126 and @xmath124 differ only by a multiple of @xmath127 one can invoke electromagnetic current conservation ( [ generalgaugeinv ] ) to show that the contraction of the full compton amplitude @xmath128 with @xmath126 gives the same result as the contraction with @xmath124 , [ contrepsgleichcontreps2str ] _",
    "l ^ ^_s^s(p^,p , q ) = _ l ^_s^s(p^,p , q ) .",

    "the same holds also for the amplitude @xmath130 .",
    "therefore the polarisation vector @xmath131 is completely equivalent to @xmath132 as long as it is contracted with a gauge invariant amplitude , as expected on general grounds .",
    "the crucial point is now that in the definition of the wave function of longitudinally polarised photons ( see ( [ defpsischlange ] ) and ( [ phischll ] ) for the correct choice ) the polarisation vector is contracted with an expression that is not gauge invariant , namely with @xmath133 which occurs in the amplitude @xmath134 .",
    "we have in fact seen explicitly in ( [ qzubarv ] ) that gauge invariance does not hold for this expression separately .",
    "let us see which concrete consequences this general observation has for the wave function of longitudinally polarised photons .",
    "for that we calculate the analogue of ( [ phischll ] ) for @xmath131 , [ pseudodefpsil ] - _ l ^ ^(q ) _ ,  ( , _ t , q ) , which would naively appear to be a reasonable definition of the photon wave function for general @xmath125 . with ( [ defpsischlange ] ) and ( [ possibleepslong ] ) we find for this contraction [ contrpseudopsil ] - n q_q ( e)^-1 |u_(k ) v_(k ) . now the product of the two spinors @xmath135 and @xmath136 with @xmath137 occurring here gives the leading term [ ubargamma0v ] |u_(k ) ^0 v_(k ) = - , and interestingly their product with @xmath138 gives exactly the same leading term , [ ubargamma3v ] |u_(k ) ^3 v_(k ) = - , where we have again used ( [ expk0he])-([k0plusmkstr0plusm ] ) .",
    "one finds in fact that even the terms proportional to @xmath139 and to @xmath140 , that is the next - to - leading terms in the expansion in @xmath141 , are identical in ( [ ubargamma0v ] ) and ( [ ubargamma3v ] ) , but we will not need those terms here . for the square brackets and the spinors in ( [ contrpseudopsil ] )",
    "one then obtains [ simpleqkappaq ] ( || + q^0 ) - ( q^0 + || ) = ( 1- ) ( || - q^0 ) times the expression ( [ ubargamma0v ] ) . applying ( [ expk0he])-([deltaelargeq ] ) and ( [ expandq0inqvec ] ) and taking into account the prefactors in ( [ contrpseudopsil ] ) we finally have [ pseudoepslfinal ] - _ l ^ ^(q ) _ ,  ( , _ t , q ) = - ( 1- ) q_q _  , -",
    "obviously , this expression strongly depends on @xmath125 which reflects the fact that @xmath111 is not gauge invariant .",
    "choosing arbitrary values for @xmath125 here would lead to completely arbitrary wave functions for longitudinally polarised photons .",
    "what happens here is that cancellations take place between terms coming from different components in the contraction with the polarisation vector .",
    "if the chosen polarisation vector contains large terms proportional to @xmath37 or @xmath142 , subleading terms in the amplitude ( or in the product of spinors ) can at the same time be enhanced due to these factors when the high energy limit @xmath143 is taken .",
    "those subleading terms , however , can not be correctly determined only from @xmath111 which was extracted only from the amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "instead , one would have to take into account also the subleading terms @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "those terms do not have a pinch singularity ( see the discussion in section [ highenergysect ] ) and are therefore difficult to identify in a nonperturbative framework using the methods that we have used here .",
    "we will comment on the situation in lowest order of perturbation theory at the end of the section .    if one wants to determine the correct wave function from the leading term at high energies alone , that is only from @xmath13 and hence from @xmath111",
    ", one must therefore choose a polarisation vector which remains finite in the high energy limit . using ( [ expandq0inqvec ] )",
    "one sees that the only possible choice for @xmath125 in ( [ possibleepslong ] ) consistent with this requirement is [ corrchoicekappa ] = -1 + ( ) , up to subleading terms as indicated .",
    "the leading term in this expression turns ( [ possibleepslong ] ) into the correct choice @xmath144 ( [ correctepslong ] ) all components of which remain finite in the high energy limit @xmath143 . with that choice one",
    "obtains in fact the correct wave function ( [ psilmomentum ] ) for longitudinally polarised photons as described above .",
    "note that a similar problem with the choice of a polarisation vector would also occur for transversely polarised photons if one decided to add terms proportional to @xmath127 to @xmath145 ( [ defepspm ] ) .",
    "there , however , the simplest choices for the polarisation vectors do not involve any factors of @xmath37 or @xmath142 . therefore the gauge invariance problem is usually not discussed in the case of transversely polarised photons .",
    "let us finally comment on the situation in lowest order of perturbation theory where the interaction of the quark - antiquark pair with the proton is given by two - gluon exchange , possibly including the resummation of soft or collinear logarithms . here",
    "the problem of choosing appropriate polarisation vectors can be studied explicitly , and the above results are found to be confirmed . in the perturbative situation it is possible to compute the photon wave function to lowest order starting from a gauge invariant expression , as it has been done for example in @xcite .",
    "there one starts with a set of diagrams in which the incoming and outgoing photons couple to a quark loop with two gluons attached in all possible ways",
    ". that amounts to four diagrams one of which is shown in figure i.[fig200 ] .",
    "this set of diagrams is exactly the expansion of our amplitude @xmath129 ( see figure i.[fig2]a ) to lowest nontrivial order and constitutes a gauge invariant expression .",
    "for such a gauge invariant set of diagrams due to ( [ contrepsgleichcontreps2strforma ] ) and its perturbative expansion the different choices of photon polarisation vectors are fully equivalent .",
    "one can then compute the leading contribution to the quark loop at high energy and subsequently split the result into factors corresponding to the incoming and outgoing photon .",
    "more precisely , it is then possible to identify the perturbative photon wave functions from the different combinations of transversely and longitudinally polarised photons by invoking conservation of quark helicities at high energy .",

    "for the case that no operators @xmath152 are present @xmath151 is the amplitude for [ ii2 ] ^(*)(q)+ab . as in previous sections",
    "we suppose [ ii2a ] q^2=-q^20 .",
    "we should point out that in general we do not have @xmath153 for the amplitude ( [ ii1 ] ) due to the t - ordering .",

    "we will generically denote the two contributions to the @xmath107-matrix for dipole states corresponding to the two diagram classes of figure [ fig : tab ] by @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively .",
    "the following assumptions will concern the @xmath107-matrix element of dipole states .",
    "since the dipole picture is usually applied only to the scattering of photons off unpolarised protons we will in fact need to make these assumptions only for the proton spin averaged @xmath107-matrix element [ spinavertmatrixel ] _ s,s",
    "_ s s d^()(,,_t , ,),p(p , s)|t| d^(q)(,,_t,,),p(p , s ) . we will nevertheless formulate the next two assumptions for the @xmath107-matrix element before averaging and point out some interesting issues concerning the proton spin in our discussion .",
    "our third assumption is the following :    * the @xmath107-matrix element occurring in ( [ vi55a ] ) is diagonal in the quark flavour , in @xmath105 and @xmath182 , and is proportional to the unit matrix in the space of spin orientations of the quark and antiquark in the dipole .    as we will see",
    "this assumption is crucial for the dipole picture , but it is far from obvious whether it can be derived on general grounds .    our assumption ( iii ) is known to hold for the simplest perturbative diagrams ( one of them is shown in figure i.[fig200 ] ) , both for the case without or with the resummation of leading logarithms of the energy , see for example @xcite .",
    "these diagrams also illustrate well the intuitive picture of high energy scattering on which the more general assumption ( iii ) is based . according to this picture a highly energetic",
    "quark or antiquark follows a straight trajectory and does not change its transverse position or its longitudinal momentum by a sizable amount while being scattered in the very forward direction , and similarly one expects its helicity to be conserved . for a discussion of this in a nonperturbative framework see for instance @xcite .",
    "the interaction would correspondingly be diagonal in flavour , in @xmath105 and @xmath182 , and in the helicity .",
    "this picture has been quite successful phenomenologically ; it for example forms the basis of all eikonal formulations of high energy scattering . a fully nonperturbative derivation of this picture including an estimate of possible corrections",
    "could presumably be done along the lines of @xcite , but this remains to be worked out .",
    "let us for instance consider the diagonality of the interaction in the transverse position of the quark .",
    "the idea that hadronic states in which the partons have fixed transverse positions become eigenstates of the @xmath107-matrix in the high energy limit has been put forward already in @xcite . in the particular case of the dipole picture one",
    "often argues that the typical lifetime of the quark - antiquark pair into which the photon fluctuates is much longer than the typical timescale of the interaction with the proton and that therefore the transverse positions ( or other properties ) of the quark and antiquark should not change during that interaction . but this argument does not make any reference to the actual dynamics of the interaction and in our opinion would need more rigorous support .",
    "while for soft gluon exchanges that argument can be made more concrete @xcite the situation remains to be clarified for general interactions .",
    "interestingly , the results found in @xcite indicate that the diagonality in @xmath182 is violated already in perturbation theory if one goes beyond the leading logarithmic approximation by taking into account exact gluon kinematics in the framework of @xmath211-factorisation @xcite",
    ". it would be very interesting to study this issue in more detail in the framework of a full calculation in next - to - leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "this could lead to a more solid test of the validity of assumption ( iii ) and hence of the foundation of the dipole picture at least in perturbation theory .",
    "an interesting issue is also the assumption that the helicity of the quark and the antiquark are conserved in the interaction .",
    "this helicity conservation has already been found in the perturbative study of various qed processes at high energy , see for example @xcite .",
    "the results obtained there for the leading terms at high energy can be applied also for gluon exchanges between quarks and hence also hold in qcd . in perturbation",
    "theory one finds that there are also contributions involving a helicity flip if one goes to the next - to - leading logarithmic approximation , see for example @xcite and references therein . it hence remains an open question to which accuracy the conservation of quark helicities holds in general .",
    "an interesting possibility to address this question might be the study of spin - dependent structure functions as we will explain in section [ sec : spindependence ] .",
    "as we have pointed out the intuitive picture of high energy scattering described above is reflected in the simplest perturbative diagrams , see for example figure i.[fig200 ] .",
    "but one should remember that those diagrams contribute only to the amplitude @xmath80 and hence to the part @xmath209 of the full @xmath107-matrix element , see figure [ fig : tab]a .",
    "one can easily see that the diagonality in assumption ( iii ) is plausible only for that part @xmath209 .",
    "let us consider the second contribution @xmath210 to the @xmath107-matrix element ( corresponding to the part @xmath81 of the amplitude ) , see figure [ fig : tab]b .",
    "one of the simplest diagrams contributing to @xmath210 is shown in figure i.[fig200b ] .",
    "the flavours in the two quark loops in this diagram are independent of each other , and the contribution of identical quark flavours in the loops constitutes only the smaller part of the amplitude .",
    "further it appears extremely unlikely that the outgoing quark and antiquark should have a high probability to be produced at the same positions in transverse space and to carry the same longitudinal momentum fractions as the incoming quark and antiquark .",
    "similar considerations can be applied to the full matrix element represented by figure [ fig : tab]b .",
    "hence we can at most expect that the part of the @xmath107-matrix element corresponding to the amplitude @xmath80 satisfies the assumption ( iii ) .    in the light of this discussion of the simplest perturbative diagrams corresponding to @xmath210 we can say that the above assumption ( iii ) is likely to exclude most contributions to the scattering amplitude contained in the amplitude @xmath81 .",
    "however , we can not make this statement rigorous based on fully nonperturbative considerations .",
    "thus , although it is most probably a consequence of assumption ( iii ) we formulate it as a separate assumption of the dipole model :    * in the @xmath107-matrix element in ( [ vi55a ] ) only the contribution @xmath209 is kept while @xmath210 is neglected .",
    "recall that the amplitude @xmath81 contributes only at higher orders of @xmath180 compared to @xmath80 , but at low photon virtualities its contribution can well be important .",
    "finally we need to make the following assumption .    *",
    "the proton spin averaged reduced matrix element depends only on @xmath212 and on @xmath213 .",
    "this assumption implies in particular that the reduced matrix element is independent of the longitudinal momentum fractions of the quark and antiquark given by @xmath105 .",
    "that reflects the usual factorisation of transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom in high energy reactions . but also for this assumption a general proof is not known .",
    "note that we have assumed here a dependence of the reduced matrix element on the squared energy @xmath214 rather than on bjorken-@xmath215 .",
    "we will explain our choice and discuss it in more detail in section [ sec : energyvariable ] below .    with the assumptions ( iii)-(v )",
    "we find for the spin averaged @xmath107-matrix element at high energy [ vi55b ] + & = & _ q _  _ ( - ) ^(2)(_t-_t ) t^(q)_red(^2_t , s ) , where @xmath216 is the reduced @xmath107-matrix element and involves only contributions coming from @xmath209 .",
    "the fact that @xmath216 is a function of @xmath212 and @xmath214 only is an immediate consequence of assumption ( v ) .",
    "the more conventional definition of the reduced @xmath107-matrix element would include all factors depending on the continuous parameters of the @xmath107-matrix element .",
    "here we have explicitly taken out the two singular factors given by the two delta - functions involving @xmath105 and @xmath182 in order to have a reduced @xmath107-matrix element that can as usual be assumed to be a smooth function of its arguments .",
    "alternatively , we could have chosen to approximate the delta - functions involving @xmath105 and @xmath182 in ( [ vi55b ] ) by strongly peaked but smooth functions and to absorb them into the definition of the reduced matrix element .",
    "that would correspond to requiring an approximate diagonality in assumption ( iii ) .",
    "we can now obtain the reduced cross section for the scattering of a dipole state on an unpolarised proton from the reduced @xmath107-matrix element via the optical theorem , [ vi55cunsmeared ] ^(q)_red(^2_t , s)= i m t^(q)_red ( ^2_t , s ) 0 .",
    "recall that we have assumed that quarks have a mass - shell in assumption ( i ) .",
    "therefore we can now conclude that this reduced cross section is non - negative since it can due to that assumption be related to a physical three - to - three scattering process @xmath217 . in this sense",
    "we can further below interpret the reduced cross section @xmath218 as the cross section for a scattering of a dipole on an unpolarised proton .",
    "note that the reduced cross section can naturally be expected to depend on the quark flavour @xmath42 , for instance via the quark mass @xmath7 .    instead of considering the original dipole states @xmath208",
    "we could also consider the corresponding @xmath107-matrix element of smeared dipole states @xmath219 as introduced in ( [ v109 ] ) .",
    "then we obtain from ( [ vi55b ] ) for large @xmath214 [ vi55bsmeared ] + & = & _ q _  _ |t^(q)_red(|^2_t , s ) with [ tredsmeared ] |t^(q)_red(|^2_t , s ) = d^2 r_t |f_t ( _ t-|_t ) |^2 t^(q)_red(^2_t , s ) .",

    "we have finally arrived at the standard formulae for the dipole picture used extensively in the literature , see for example @xcite .",
    "we have tried to spell out all the assumptions that enter and that should be carefully examined when one wants to draw conclusions , for instance concerning saturation , from a supposed ` unitarity limit ' for @xmath228 .",
    "we consider it an important task for the future to test the assumptions and to quantify their accuracy .",
    "note that in the dipole formulae ( [ vi55 g ] ) and ( [ vi55i ] ) @xmath227 appears formally as an integration variable .",
    "but the interpretation of these formulae as a factorisation into the square of a photon wave function and a cross section for the scattering of a dipole of transverse size @xmath227 on a proton is very natural in view of the relation of the latter to the corresponding @xmath107-matrix element , see ( [ vi55b ] ) and ( [ vi55cunsmeared ] ) .",
    "we will therefore simply call @xmath218 a dipole cross section in the following . due to the same relation to a @xmath107-matrix element involving a particular quark",
    "flavour it is also natural that this dipole cross section still depends on that quark flavour @xmath42 .",
    "next we discuss two issues that we have postponed earlier in this section .",
    "the first point is the dependence on the proton spin .",
    "so far we have considered only the scattering of transversely or longitudinally polarised photons on an unpolarised proton , and we have obtained the usual formulae of the dipole picture for the total cross sections of these processes . as a consequence , we needed to make our assumption ( iii ) only for the proton spin averaged @xmath107-matrix element ( [ spinavertmatrixel ] ) rather than for the actual @xmath107-matrix element which occurs in ( [ vi55a ] ) .",
    "nevertheless we have formulated our assumption ( iii ) for the latter , which amounts to making a stronger assumption .",
    "it now seems very interesting to think about possible tests of the dependence of that matrix element on the proton spin . to our knowledge , all models proposed so far for the dipole cross section @xmath229 have been used only for calculating scattering processes on unpolarised protons .",
    "some of these models are based on an additional assumption about the proton , namely that it can be considered at high energies as a superposition of colour dipoles described by a suitable weight function for their transverse size and orientation . the scattering process",
    "can then be expressed in terms of the cross section of two colour dipoles . in phenomenological applications",
    "one hence only needs to make a model for that simpler cross section . for a typical approach along these lines",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that this assumption goes beyond the dipole picture as we have derived it here , and it is in our opinion far from obvious that the proton can be approximated by a collection of dipoles",
    ". it would of course be very interesting to see if that assumption can be justified using the techniques developed in the present work .",
    "let us now for a moment adopt that additional assumption .",
    "one expects the dipole - dipole cross section and the corresponding @xmath107-matrix element to be symmetric under the exchange of the two dipoles at least in the large-@xmath230 limit in which a colour dipole can be viewed as a quark - antiquark pair . in assumption ( iii )",
    "we have assumed that the @xmath107-matrix element in ( [ vi55a ] ) is proportional to the unit matrix in the space of spin orientations of the quark and antiquark .",
    "accordingly , one would now have to assume that the dipole - dipole @xmath107-matrix element is also proportional to the unit matrix in the space of spin orientations corresponding to the dipole in the proton . as an immediate consequence one finds that in such a picture the polarised proton structure function @xmath231 vanishes .",
    "since this is in contradiction with the experimental findings ( for a review see @xcite ) one might conclude that at least the additional assumption does not hold , but that would be premature . on the contrary , that result would be in agreement with the general finding that the polarised structure function @xmath231 is suppressed at high energy with respect to the unpolarised structure function @xmath232 .",
    "it has been established for example in regge theory that @xmath231 is suppressed with respect to @xmath232 by a power of the energy @xcite , and a similar picture emerges also in perturbation theory both in extrapolations of altarelli - parisi evolution @xcite to small bjorken-@xmath215 @xcite and in calculations taking into account double - logarithmic contributions beyond altarelli - parisi evolution @xcite . in many steps of our arguments",
    "leading to the dipole picture subleading terms at high energy have been neglected .",
    "thus it is consistent that the leading level result for an observable that starts at a subleading level is zero .",
    "turning this argument around the polarised structure function @xmath231 might offer an opportunity to study the structure and the size of subleading terms at high energies .",
    "the most important question is of course whether it is possible to find a consistent description of @xmath231 ( or of any other observable that starts at a subleading level in the expansion in inverse powers of the energy ) in the dipole picture .",
    "this problem could be studied independently of the additional assumption that the proton can be considered as a superposition of colour dipoles .",
    "( note , however , that that additional assumption is at least consistent with the known results about @xmath231 . ) further studies along these lines might either show that also subleading terms can be factorised according to the dipole picture , or tell us about a potential breakdown of the dipole picture for subleading terms . in the latter case",
    "one could even hope to quantify the size of potential corrections to the dipole picture in general .",
    "the other important issue that we have not yet discussed in detail is the question whether the dipole cross section @xmath229 should depend on the squared energy @xmath214 or on bjorken-@xmath215 in addition to the dependence on the dipole size @xmath227 . since at high energies @xmath233 the latter possibility would imply a dependence of the dipole cross section on @xmath10 while such a dependence would be absent if the former possibility were chosen .",
    "phenomenological models for the dipole cross section have been proposed based on both possibilities , and both can lead to a satisfactory description of the available data .",
    "overall , models based on an @xmath234-dependent dipole cross section appear to be more popular at present .",
    "a model with an @xmath214-dependent dipole cross section has been constructed for instance in @xcite while a prominent example for an @xmath234-dependent dipole cross section is the model of @xcite . in our approach",
    "we have obtained the dipole cross section from a @xmath107-matrix element for the scattering of a dipole state on a proton , see ( [ vi55b ] ) and ( [ vi55cunsmeared ] ) .",
    "but as we have discussed in section [ sec : realvirtleadingorder ] the dipole states entering this matrix element are independent of the photon virtuality @xmath10 at high energy as can be seen from the expression for their invariant mass ( [ p2aufdipolhe ] ) , see also the corresponding formulae ( [ meanp2smeareddip ] ) and ( [ meanm2smeareddip ] ) for smeared dipole states .",
    "the relevant @xmath107-matrix element thus corresponds to a scattering process in which the initial and final state is independent of @xmath10 . according to this observation we have chosen our dipole cross section @xmath229 to depend only on @xmath214 rather than on @xmath234 in our assumption ( v ) . the main motivation for choosing an @xmath234-dependence in many phenomenological models comes from studying the simultaneous limit of large @xmath214 and large @xmath10 .",
    "in this limit the cross section for photon - proton scattering should agree with the perturbative result obtained in the double - leading logarithmic approximation ( dlla ) @xcite .",
    "as was discussed already in @xcite the dipole cross section can in that limit be identified up to factors with the gluon density of the proton .",
    "the latter naturally depends on @xmath234 and @xmath10 and therefore suggests to choose the dependence on @xmath234 also at lower @xmath10 .",
    "can we decide which variable is the correct one for the dipole cross section ?",
    "let us first recall that @xmath182 in ( [ vi55 g ] ) and ( [ vi55i ] ) is an integration variable .",
    "we can therefore perform a change of variables [ changeofintvar ] _",
    "t = _t , where @xmath235 is some fixed momentum scale . expressing the integrands of ( [ vi55 g ] ) and ( [ vi55i ] ) in terms of the new integration variable @xmath236",
    "we obtain formulae similar to the dipole model that contain a factor [ defsigafterchange ] ^(q)_red(^2_t , q , x_bj ) = ^(q)_red ( ^2_t , s ) which we could define as a reduced cross section that depends on @xmath237 , @xmath238 and @xmath234 instead of @xmath212 and @xmath214 .",
    "however , in this case @xmath236 is no longer the physical size parameter of the colour dipole .",
    "moreover , the substitution ( [ changeofintvar ] ) would affect also the other factor in the integrands of ( [ vi55 g ] ) and ( [ vi55i ] ) and hence spoil the interpretation of the integrand as a product of an actual dipole - proton cross section with the square of the perturbative photon wave function .",
    "we therefore discard the mathematical possibility of changing the integration variable from @xmath182 to @xmath236 .",
    "a discussion of @xmath214 versus @xmath234 dependence of the dipole cross section was given in chapter 9 of @xcite and our remarks below follow the same lines .",
    "for large photon virtualities @xmath10 one finds that the integrals in ( [ vi55 g ] ) and ( [ vi55i ] ) receive the dominant contribution from small @xmath227 due to the shape of the weight factors @xmath239 . for small @xmath227",
    "the dipole - proton cross section should become small due to colour transparency , and the typical behaviour to be expected at small @xmath227 is @xmath240 .",
    "hence a typical ansatz for small @xmath227 is [ sigsmallrexpfactr2 ] ^(q)_red ( r_t^2,s ) = r_t^2 f ( ) , where @xmath241 is a dimensionless scaling function .",
    "naive scaling arguments suggest this and in qcd we expect ( [ sigsmallrexpfactr2 ] ) to hold up to logarithmic corrections in @xmath227 . inserting ( [ sigsmallrexpfactr2 ] ) in ( [ vi55 g ] ) and ( [ vi55i ] ) we find that the explicit factor @xmath242 together with the weight functions @xmath243 and an additional factor @xmath227 from the integral measure @xmath244 leads to a pronounced maximum in the integrands situated at [ intmaxpos ] r^2_tmax = with @xmath245 , see p.  273 of @xcite and figure [ fig : spikes ] in section [ densitysect ] below .",
    "that is , for large @xmath10 mostly dipoles of size @xmath246 contribute .",
    "we may therefore make the replacement [ replaceinint ] ^(q)_red ( r_t^2,s ) & & r_t^2 f ( ) r_t^2 f ( ) + & & r_t^2 f ( ) _ red^(q ) ( r_t^2,x_bj ) for @xmath247 .",
    "hence it is only due to the behaviour of the other factors in the integrands and the explicit factor @xmath242 in ( [ sigsmallrexpfactr2 ] ) that an @xmath214-dependent @xmath229 and an @xmath234-dependent @xmath229 lead to the same result at large @xmath10 .",
    "it is therefore not possible to establish an @xmath234-dependence of the dipole cross section in general based on this argument .",
    "as we have described above , in our approach an @xmath214-dependence occurs naturally .",
    "we can not exclude that a different derivation of the dipole picture based on a different set of assumptions is possible in which an @xmath234-dependence occurs . if one wants to maintain the interpretation of @xmath229 as an actual cross section involving a quark - antiquark colour dipole state , however , one would need to define the dipole states in such a way that they depend on @xmath10 in leading order in the expansion in inverse powers of @xmath214 .",
    "this would in particular exclude the natural definition ( [ v104 ] ) which we have used .    in this context we should add a further remark .",
    "it would of course be interesting to establish the relation of our derivation of the dipole picture with the perturbative picture of the dlla step by step .",
    "but there is a potential problem . in the present paper",
    "we study the limit [ limitsinfqfixed ] s , q^2 fixed , whereas in the dlla one takes [ limitsinfqinf ] s , q^2 , fixed .",
    "it is not at all clear and not necessary that first taking the limit ( [ limitsinfqfixed ] ) and then letting @xmath10 become large will lead to the same result as taking the limit ( [ limitsinfqinf ] ) .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this makes the comparison of our derivation with the perturbative approach intrinsically difficult .      in the dipole picture",
    "the photon - proton cross section is obtained as the convolution of the square of the photon wave function with the dipole cross section .",

    "this might pose a problem in the context of our discussion in section [ sec : energyvariable ] but for the purpose of illustrating the behaviour of @xmath6 in a typical dipole model we can disregard this issue . we should point out in this context that our bound ( [ boundonr ] ) is completely independent of the variables on which the dipole cross section depends . in the golec - biernat - wsthoff model",
    "the dipole cross section @xmath229 is given by [ gbwformel ] ^(q)_gbw = _ 0 with [ gbwr0 ] r_0 ^ 2 ( ) = ( ) ^ ^-2 , where the three parameters of the model are chosen to be @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath309 .",

    "@xmath10 below about @xmath319 the bound is significantly below the original bound ( [ boundonr ] ) which was obtained for massless light quarks and which is shown in the figure as the dotted line .    more precise data on @xmath6 might in the future",
    "serve as an additional test of the quality of various models for the dipole cross section",
    ". it would therefore be interesting to study in more detail the behaviour of @xmath6 also in other models for the dipole cross section .",
    "an interesting aspect of such studies could be in particular the choice of a suitable phenomenological light quark mass which is required for the photoproduction limit or is motivated by the expected breakdown of the perturbative description of the photon wave function at large dipole sizes . for a consistent description one should clearly use the same light quark mass in the photon wave function and in the model for the dipole cross section . since the bound on @xmath6 depends on the mass of the light quarks in the photon wave function especially at low @xmath10 it would even be possible to use more precise data on @xmath6 in that region to obtain bounds on possible choices of a phenomenological mass for light quarks in the photon wave function and hence also in models for the dipole cross section .",
    "in this paper and in the companion paper i we have studied how the dipole picture of high energy scattering can be derived in the framework of a genuinely nonperturbative formulation of photon - nucleon scattering .",
    "we have analysed in detail the compton amplitude for real and virtual photons and have isolated the contributions to it which are leading at high energies .",
    "we have taken into account properly the renormalisation of these contributions and have studied their gauge invariance emphasising in particular its relevance for the definition of the perturbative photon wave function .",
    "we have then identified the approximations and assumptions which are necessary to arrive at the usual dipole picture .    at high energies",
    "we obtain indeed the dipole picture , but also find two important additional contributions .",
    "one of them corresponds to rescattering effects of the quark and antiquark forming the colour dipole .",
    "the other additional contribution corresponds to diagrams in which the incoming photon and the outgoing photon do not couple to the same quark loop .",
    "both of these terms are of higher order in the coupling constant @xmath180 but are not suppressed by powers of the energy . in lowest order in perturbation theory these two additional terms do not contribute , and one is left with only the usual dipole picture . at low photon virtualities on the other hand we expect that both additional contributions can have sizable effects .",
    "we expect for example that the rescattering term will play an important role in the transition to low photon virtualities for which vector meson dominance applies .",
    "the rescattering term should in fact generate the relevant diagrams for the formation of quark - antiquark bound states",
    ". it would therefore be very interesting to see whether our results can be used to obtain a better picture of the transition from a perturbative photon wave function at high virtualities to vector meson dominance at low virtualities .",
    "a crucial question in all phenomenological applications of the dipole picture concerns the range of its applicability , or in other words the kinematical region in which the approximations and assumptions leading to the dipole model hold . we have derived a bound on the ratio @xmath6 of the cross sections for the scattering of longitudinally and transversely polarised photons off hadrons which is relevant in this context .",
    "the bound is obtained only from the perturbative photon wave function and is independent of any particular model for the dipole - proton cross section .",
    "therefore it allows for a model independent test of the dipole picture .",
    "unfortunately the presently available data are not precise enough to restrict the range of applicability of the dipole picture . however , the data appear to come close to the bound below photon virtualities of about @xmath305 , suggesting that at least in that region one should be careful in interpreting high energy scattering data in terms of the dipole picture only . in @xcite",
    "we have presented further bounds on ratios of nucleon structure functions @xmath232 taken at the same energy @xmath320 but at different photon virtualities @xmath10 resulting from the dipole picture .",
    "they are suitable for further constraining the range of applicability of the dipole picture .",
    "the dipole picture is often discussed in the context of the space - time picture of high energy photon - hadron scattering in the target rest frame . here",
    "the photon splits into a long - lived quark - antiquark pair which then interacts with the hadron .",
    "our study confirms this space - time picture and supplements it with the renormalisation of the photon - quark - antiquark vertex .",
    "the space - time picture is closely related to the notion of the light - cone wave function of the photon , suggesting a hamiltonian picture of the evolution of the photon wave function and of the scattering process .",
    "we emphasise that we have obtained the dipole picture in a purely lagrangian approach here .",
    "this allowed us in particular to implement the renormalisation procedure in a simple and transparent way . in a hamiltonian approach a natural extension of the dipole picture",
    "is to include higher fock states in the photon wave function . in a first step one",
    "would include for example the quark - antiquark - gluon component of that wave function .",
    "as we have already pointed out in i we do not expect to see such higher fock states in the decompositions of the compton amplitude which we have performed .",
    "we emphasise that they are not missing in our approach .",
    "gluon emissions from the quark and antiquark are in our approach contained both in the rescattering term and in the dipole - nucleon cross section",
    ". it would be interesting to study in detail whether and how a consistent separation of such contributions into parts belonging to the photon wave function and to the dipole - nucleon scattering amplitude can be done .",
    "naturally one would expect that this separation would require to introduce a factorisation scale .",
    "we recall that in the usual dipole picture the factorisation of the cross section into the square of the photon wave function and a dipole - proton cross section does not involve such a factorisation scale .",
    "we consider it an important task for future work to establish a closer relation of our approach with perturbation theory .",
    "it should be possible to follow our derivation of the dipole picture step by step in a perturbative setting .",
    "we have for example checked our results concerning the different choices for the polarisation vector for longitudinally polarised photons in the abelian gluon model of @xcite where the cancellations between different terms become very transparent . in the comparison with the perturbative framework",
    "it would be especially interesting to see how the picture of higher fock states of the photon is related to our results .",
    "another very important problem is to understand the relation between inclusive and diffractive photon - nucleon scattering .",
    "this problem has also been addressed in the framework of the dipole picture , see for example @xcite . in our opinion",
    "it is a nontrivial question whether the same approximations and assumptions leading to the dipole model in inclusive scattering also lead to the usual description of diffractive scattering in terms of the dipole - nucleon cross section as given by ( [ dipcrossdiff ] ) .",
    "this question becomes particularly challenging when one wants to include corrections from higher fock states in the photon wave function .",
    "we expect that the study of diffractive scattering in the approach presented here can provide more insight into these problems .",
    "we hope that our approach can also help to address other important questions concerning high energy lepton - nucleon scattering .",
    "we have pointed out for example that a study of polarised structure functions in the framework of the dipole picture might allow one to investigate and to quantify contributions that are subleading at high energies in unpolarised scattering .",
    "another interesting issue is the choice of the energy variable in the dipole - proton cross section .",
    "our results strongly suggest that the correct energy variable should be the total energy @xmath320 rather than bjorken-@xmath215 .",
    "we can not exclude , however , that different approaches to deriving the dipole picture in a nonperturbative framework lead to a different result concerning the energy variable .",
    "we consider this to be an interesting question for future studies .",
    "a third problem which we consider to be important is the use of the mass - shell condition for quarks .",
    "motivated by local parton - hadron duality one often treats quarks produced into the final state as on - shell particles , especially in perturbative calculations .",
    "the assumption of a quark mass shell is also important for the usual formulation of high energy scattering in a hamiltonian approach where the cross sections of higher fock states of the photon are only well - defined for on - shell partons . due to confinement , however , a mass - shell for quarks actually does not exist .",
    "we expect that by carefully tracing the effect of using the mass - shell - condition for quarks in our framework one can learn something about the validity of this assumption",
    ".    the approach presented here might also offer the possibility to study in another way the transition region from high to low photon virtualities which has been a key question in many applications of the dipole picture to deep inelastic scattering .",
    "most of those studies try to use the framework of the dipole picture and introduce modifications of the dipole - nucleon cross section at low virtualities .",
    "the formulae derived here appear to be suited also for an implementation of nonperturbative green s functions as obtained for instance in studies of nonperturbative dyson - schwinger equations . in this way",
    "one could hope to approach the transition region also from the side of low virtualities . in practice that would certainly require a number of additional approximations , and",
    "would hence be less rigorous .",
    "nevertheless , we think that it would be very important from a phenomenological point of view to study the transition region between small and large photon virtualities using all available methods .",
    "the general methods developed here can also be applied to other current induced reactions at high energies , including exclusive reactions .",
    "an interesting application would be the study of reactions induced by electroweak currents .",
    "the perturbative wave functions of @xmath321 and @xmath322 bosons have recently been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we expect that the derivation of the dipole picture for electroweak currents in a nonperturbative framework can be performed using essentially the same approximations and assumptions that were needed for photon induced reactions .",
    "let us finally give a brief summary of the main findings of the present paper and of the companion paper i.    * in i we used functional methods to classify the contributions to the compton amplitude in terms of nonperturbative quark - skeleton diagrams , see figure i.[fig2 ] .",
    "the important diagrams at high energies were found to be those of figures i.[fig2]a and i.[fig2]b .",
    "* cutting the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) of figure i.[fig2 ] next to the incoming photon vertex and inserting suitable factors of one we could identify parts corresponding to the photon vertex and to quark - antiquark scattering off the proton .",
    "proper account was taken of renormalisation and this led to the introduction of the rescattering terms , see section i.[sec : currenttoquarkqft ] . * in the high - energy limit as studied in the present paper the compton amplitude was split into a genuine quark - antiquark - proton scattering amplitude and a photon - wave - function piece including rescattering terms . here",
    "the assumption of the existence of a quark mass shell was made . *",
    "the equivalence of an incoming or outgoing high - energy photon to incoming or outgoing quark - antiquark - dipole states was given explicitly in section [ sec : genphotons ] for arbitrary reactions .",
    "as always , vertex and rescattering terms occurred .",
    "* the lowest order perturbative wave function of the photon was studied in detail .",
    "it was shown that the polarisation vectors of the virtual photon have to be chosen such that they do not contain terms growing indefinitely as @xmath323 .",
    "gauge invariance was discussed in detail and was found to be crucial in this context , see section [ wavefunctsec ] . * in section [ sec : dippictdis ] deep inelastic scattering was treated and the assumptions needed to arrive at the usual formulae of the dipole model were spelled out in detail . a bound on @xmath324 which followed from these assumptions",
    "was derived and its consequences were discussed in section [ sec : phencons ] .",
    "this bound can be used to test the kinematic region in which the usual dipole model can be applied .",
    "the dipole picture has been surprisingly successful in describing the data obtained at hera and has substantially contributed to the understanding of photon - nucleon scattering . in the near future the lhc will offer the possibility to study photon - proton and photon - photon collisions at even higher energies for quasi - real photons . particularly suitable for this purpose are highly peripheral heavy ion collisions where the coulomb field of a fast heavy ion acts as a beam of quasi - real photons .",
    "we expect that the dipole picture will be a very useful tool for analysing the data to come from the lhc in this field .",
    "a thorough study of the dipole formalism , its nonperturbative foundations and its necessary modifications is therefore very important . with the present study",
