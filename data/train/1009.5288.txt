    "generically , neutral colloidal particles attract each other via van der waals and casimir forces , and measures must be taken to prevent aggregation of clusters in both experimental systems and technological applications .",
    "one might be led to conclude that purely attractive hard - core particles could only form close - packed lattices or glassy messes .",
    "but the phenomenon of aggregation in colloids is not restricted to particles that attract each other . over the past two decades clustering in purely repulsive pair potentials has been explored in some detail to find that it is distinguished by emerging order not seen in attractive particles . in particular",
    ", it has been established that at large enough density , clumping repulsive colloids can form superstructures with large voids on the order of many particle diameters  @xcite .",
    "indeed , malescio and pellicane  @xcite demonstrated that even simple hard - core , square - shoulder potentials led to clustering purely on energetic grounds . the cluster morphologies and the clustering criterion itself have been studied theoretically using a range of approaches including liquid - state theory  @xcite , lattice theory  @xcite , density functional theory  @xcite , and continuum models  @xcite , and the predictions of the different approaches are remarkably consistent .",
    "equally unequivocal are the results of numerical studies , mostly using monte carlo methods  @xcite and direct search of minimal - energy configurations using genetic algorithms  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile at this juncture to step back and develop a minimal set of simple rules to expose the mechanism of lattice formation in these systems .",
    "it is our hope that these rules will make clear the essential ingredients needed for pattern formation in this large class of purely repellent systems .",
    "moreover , we develop these ideas in the context of real - space potentials and interactions yet recapitulate the clustering criterion of the more technical ( though precise ) fourier - based analyses  @xcite . designing potentials in real space offers a more intuitive route to rational self - assembly and connects directly with , for instance , laser - trap and depletion based potentials .    in this note",
    ", we do this by using the continuum @xmath0 model of the stripe phase formed by particles interacting via the hard - core / square - shoulder pair potential @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the diameters of the core and the shoulder , respectively , and @xmath4 is the shoulder height  @xcite",
    ". characterized by a one - dimensional density modulation , the stripe phase is mathematically the most transparent of all cluster morphologies and our real - space analysis may be easier to visualize than reciprocal - space arguments  @xcite . moreover , by focusing on energy rather than on free energy we emphasize that the entropy does not promote clustering .",
    "these results are then extended to explore the generic phase diagram of the cluster - forming system at finite temperatures .",
    "in the following , we first evaluate the energy of a two - dimensional hard - core / square - shoulder system with given hard - core diameter @xmath2 and shoulder diameter @xmath5 at a fixed average number density , and we minimize it with respect to intra - cluster density , cluster size , and lattice spacing .",
    "we consider the simplest cluster morphology , the one - dimensional square - wave of uniformly populated parallel stripes of width @xmath6 and particle - free gaps of width @xmath7 ; the lattice spacing is @xmath8 . in the continuum model",
    "suitable in the large shoulder - to - core limit where @xmath5 is sufficiently larger than @xmath2 , the energy per particle can be related to the average overlap area per particle defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the heaviside step function describing the shape of the shoulder potential and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the locations of particles 1 and 2 , respectively , measured from the origin at an edge of the stripe in question . the first integration over @xmath13 , the distance of particle 1 from a stripe edge , is over the stripe containing particle 1 and the integration over @xmath12 goes over all stripes .",
    "@xmath14 captures the interaction of the shoulders of particles , whereas the hard - core repulsion is treated in a mean - field approximation by demanding that the number density within stripes @xmath15 be no larger than @xmath16 corresponding to the close - packed hexagonal arrangement of the particles hard - disk cores .",
    "this approximation is applicable in the broad shoulder regime @xmath17 and at densities large enough that the stripes are sufficiently wider than the core diameter so that speaking of `` intra - cluster packing '' of particles has meaning .    in terms of @xmath14 ,",
    "the average energy per particle reads @xmath18 but the number density of particles within stripes depends on their width relative to lattice spacing @xmath19 , which represents the fraction of the total area that is occupied by the stripes . in terms of the average density @xmath20 , @xmath21 since the energy is to be minimized at fixed @xmath20 rather than at fixed @xmath15 it is convenient to introduce the scaled average overlap area @xmath22 which includes all dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "for the hard - core / square - shoulder pair interaction , @xmath24 can be computed analytically but the result is too cumbersome to be of interest here .",
    "we will now establish some rules of thumb .    [ [ i .- clusters - are - close - packed ] ] i. clusters are close - packed + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in [ omega ] we plot the reduced scaled average overlap area @xmath25 as a function of reduced lattice spacing @xmath26 for several stripe widths @xmath19 .",
    "the cluster - free , unmodulated phase corresponds to @xmath27 and its nature depends on density : as argued below , its phase sequence includes the expanded fluid , the expanded hexagonal crystal , the condensed fluid , and the condensed hexagonal crystal .",
    "but since we treat the hard - core part of the pair interaction in a mean - field fashion , worrying only about the average number of neighbors within the reach of a particle s shoulder , the exact nature of the unmodulated phase is not crucial to understand why clustering takes place .     for @xmath28 ; for the sake of clarity , only curves corresponding to @xmath29 and 0.9 are labeled .",
    "the global minimum of the reduced scaled overlap area @xmath30 at @xmath31 is deepest for vanishingly small @xmath19 , which suggests that the equilibrium stripes are as compact as possible , _",
    "i.e. _ , close - packed . the square density waves representing stripes with @xmath32 and 0.9 ( top ) schematically depict the stripe morphologies at @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; the second column where @xmath35 corresponds to a lattice spacing exactly equal to the shoulder width . ]    the uniform , unmodulated phase can be interpreted as a stripe morphology with a very fine density modulation such that the lattice spacing and the stripe width are much smaller than the two characteristic length scales of the pair potential , @xmath5 and @xmath2 . in this limit , @xmath36 irrespective of @xmath19 which tells us that for @xmath37 the average energy per particle is @xmath38 . as @xmath39",
    "is increased , @xmath30 oscillates around @xmath40 , reaches a global minimum at @xmath31 , and then grows monotonically to saturate at a value of @xmath41 .",
    "the large @xmath42 behavior is a signature of macroscopic phase separation : at fixed @xmath19 , states with reduced lattice spacing @xmath42 beyond @xmath43 correspond to thick stripe widths @xmath44 with an ever smaller number of particles residing at the boundary of the stripes .",
    "the average energy per particle is gradually dominated by that of the particles well within the bulk of the stripes , which reads @xmath45 because the density within the stripes is larger than the average density by a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "this result gives @xmath47 .",
    "the most important feature of this diagram is that the depth of the minimum decreases with increasing relative stripe width @xmath19 .",
    "this means that at any given average density @xmath48 , the system will select the state with the smallest possible @xmath19 at the expense of the density within stripes .",
    "for example , the curves corresponding to @xmath49 and 0.2 represent two possible states of the system of a fixed average density @xmath20 . according to [ omega ] ,",
    "the absolute minimum of the former is lower than that of the latter , which means that of the two stripe phases in question , the @xmath49 state minimizes the total energy @xmath50 .",
    "but since the relative stripe width of the @xmath49 state is half of that of the @xmath51 , the corresponding density within stripes must be twice as large as in the latter state . in other words ,",
    "the ground state geometry of the stripes minimizes @xmath19 , restricted only by the close - packing limit forbidding stripes with @xmath52 beyond the close - packed density @xmath53 .",
    "we conclude that at @xmath0 the optimal stripes are made of close - packed particles so that @xmath54 and the reduced average number density @xmath55 coincides with @xmath19 .    [ [ ii .- lattice - spacing - weakly - depends - on - density ] ] ii . lattice spacing",

    "it is apparent that @xmath56 is largest at half - filling where it reaches @xmath57 , which nicely agrees with the value of @xmath58 predicted by the lattice theory  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath59 is well described by a parabola symmetric about @xmath60 . even in the infinitely - dilute and close - packed limits , @xmath56 tends to @xmath61  but this result is of no physical consequence . as shown below , the binding energy vanishes in these two limits so that the clustering mechanism is not acting and the corresponding equilibrium reduced lattice spacings are irrelevant .",
    "this observation is made even more compelling by employing observation i : since the ground - state stripes are close - packed , we may as well switch back to the average overlap area per particle , @xmath14 and write the energy as @xmath62 ; @xmath63 can thus be regarded as the reduced energy . in [ omegaf ]",
    "we plot @xmath64 as a function of reduced lattice spacing @xmath39 .",
    "it is apparent in this presentation that the location of the global minimum of @xmath64 is little changed over the range @xmath65 and again we conclude that @xmath56 is roughly independent of @xmath59 .    , as a function of reduced lattice spacing @xmath42 for @xmath66 . in the unmodulated phase at @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "the inset shows the reduced binding energy @xmath69 [ as illustrated in the @xmath70 curve ] which is a skewed u - shaped function of reduced average density and vanishes at @xmath71 and @xmath72 . ]    from [ omegaf ] we also extract the reduced binding energy @xmath73 defined as the depth of the global minimum of @xmath74 at @xmath56 relative to the unmodulated phase at @xmath75 .",
    "the reduced binding energy shown in the inset to [ omegaf ] is a skewed u - shaped function of reduced average density which vanishes for @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in an infinitely dilute system ,",
    "the energy of the unmodulated phase itself tends to 0 and no spatial modulation of the density profile can reduce it further so that the binding energy is 0 too . on the other hand , a system of average density close to @xmath53 can not undergo but a very restricted spatial modulation ( because the density within the stripes should not exceed @xmath53 ) and thus the energy gained upon clustering approaches 0 when @xmath76 .",
    "although @xmath64 and @xmath30 are closely related , they convey a somewhat different message . from [ omega ]",
    "we learned that the particles within the stripes are close - packed , which enabled us to directly relate the average density @xmath20 to relative stripe width @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , [ omegaf ] exposes the binding energy of the equilibrium stripe morphology more clearly .",
    "but as far as the magnitude of the equilibrium lattice spacing is concerned , both quantities are equally telling .",
    "our two observations can be used to qualitatively outline the phase diagram of the cluster phases in the temperature - density plane . to this end , we need to study the difference of the free energies of the stripe phase and the unmodulated phase , which consists of an energy term @xmath77 and of an entropic term .",
    "the entropy of the two phases depends on their structure elaborated below in a semi - quantitative fashion .    at absolute zero ,",
    "one of the hallmark features of the stripe morphology is its compact intra - stripe structure where the impenetrable hard cores of the particles are packed together as tightly as possible at any reduced average density @xmath59 .",
    "this state is materialized by the hexagonal lattice .",
    "because of the robust , density - independent nature of this behavior , we posit that at finite temperatures the intra - stripe density @xmath15 should not depend strongly on the reduced average density either ( though it must be smaller than the close - packing density @xmath53 ) and that the intra - stripe order remains hexagonal .",
    "the structure of the unmodulated phases of hard - core / square - shoulder particles is more complicated and despite decades of efforts ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , their thermodynamics remains only a partly solved problem .",
    "for the purpose of present discussion , it suffices to note that at low temperatures where they compete with cluster morphologies , the phase sequence of unmodulated phases consists of 4 variants , the 2 low - density and high - density phases being characterized with little and sizable overlap of particles shoulders , respectively . at very small densities ,",
    "the particles form an expanded fluid of disks of shoulder diameter @xmath5 ( schematically shown in [ fex ] ) . as this fluid",
    "is compressed , it undergoes a transition to the expanded hexagonal crystal of disks of diameter @xmath5 .",
    "the location of the transition can be estimated by rescaling the phase diagram of the hard - disk system : @xmath78  @xcite . upon further compression , the expanded hexagonal phase remelts to avoid close - packing ; since the overlap of shoulders is increasingly less unfavorable at elevated temperatures , the phase transition density should decrease with temperature . from this transition on , the particles behave essentially as hard spheres of diameter @xmath2 and the transition to the condensed hexagonal phase takes place approximately at @xmath79  @xcite .    understanding the main features of the sequence of unmodulated phases helps us to construct semi - qualitatively the entropic part of their free energy .",
    "we first note that the pressure of the hard - disk hexagonal crystal can be roughly regarded as a continuation of the hard - disk fluid branch  @xcite and we approximate the excess entropic free energy per particle in both the fluid and the crystal unmodulated phase by @xmath80 \\label{fexe}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 .",
    "this prediction is based on the 2d carnahan - starling type theory for the fluid phase  @xcite .",
    "admittedly a rough approximation  it does not distinguish between the fluid and the crystalline phase , and the hexatic phase is disregarded altogether  this excess entropic free energy provides a simple and adequate model across a broad range of reduced densities consistent with the scope of this analysis .",
    "its main deficiency is the poor description of the crystalline phase ( whose excess entropic free energy should diverge at reduced average density of @xmath72 and not at @xmath82 ) .",

    "we approximate the temperature dependence of the reduced density within stripes by a linearly decreasing function @xmath99 in the following , we choose @xmath100 : at the largest reduced temperature where the stripe morphology is stable , this gives @xmath101 which is plausible .    in [ phased]a , we plot @xmath102 for several values of reduced temperature @xmath103 .",
