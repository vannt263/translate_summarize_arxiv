    "with the birth and development of quantum technologies , quantum control systems constructed using quantum optical devices play a more and more important role in control engineering , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "implementation of the system at the hardware level is shown in figure [ fig : network - c ] .",
    "analogously to the electrical network synthesis theory of how to synthesize linear analog circuits from basic electrical components , @xcite have proposed a quantum network synthesis theory ( briefly introduced in subsection [ subsect : quantum ] of this paper ) , which details how to realize a quantum system described by state space representations using quantum optical devices .    ]    ]    the purpose of this paper is to address this issue of quantum physical realization for a class of classical linear systems .",
    "for example , the quantum physical realization of the system is shown in figure [ fig : realnew ] ( see example 1 in section [ sec : main results ] for more details ) .",
    "the essential quantum optical components used in figure [ fig : realnew ] include optical cavities , degenerate parametric amplifiers ( dpa ) , phase shifters , beam splitters , and squeezers , etc ; interested readers may refer to @xcite , @xcite for a more detailed introduction to these optical devices",
    ". the problem of quantum physical realization can be solved by embedding the classical system into a larger linear quantum system , theorem [ thm : main ] . in this way ,",
    "the classical system is represented as an invariant commutative subsystem of the larger quantum system .",
    "while the results of this paper may be useful for a variety of problems outside the scope of measurement feedback control , the principle motivation for realizing classical systems in quantum hardware is that one is better able to match the timescales and hardware of a classical controller to the system being controlled .",
    "classical hardware is typically much slower than the quantum systems intended to be controlled , and complex interface hardware may be required .",
    "compared with classical systems typically implemented using standard analog or digital electronics , quantum mechanical systems may provide a bandwidth much higher than that of conventional electronics and thus increase processing times .",
    "for instance , quantum optical systems can have frequencies up to @xmath6 hz or higher .",
    "furthermore , it is becoming feasible to implement quantum networks in semiconductor materials , for example , photonic crystals are periodic optical nanostructures that are designed to affect the motion of photons in a similar way that periodicity of a semiconductor crystal affects the motion of electrons , and it may be desirable to implement control networks on the same chip ( rather than interfacing to a separate system ) ; see @xcite .",
