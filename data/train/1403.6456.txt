    "notice first of all that for @xmath146 the expression @xmath147 is a polynomial in @xmath93 of degree smaller than @xmath31 , therefore the same is true of @xmath148 so this expression is orthogonal to @xmath149 on @xmath0 with respect to area measure .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath193 is again a hilbert - space , but note that it is different from @xmath194 ( the definition of the norm on the two spaces is the same , but the latter space contains also functions that may not be analytically continued throughout @xmath0 , while the former space contains only analytic functions in @xmath0 ) .",

    "in fact , for @xmath206 the relation in ( [ eq : kk1-ti ] ) is quite standard , see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * section 1.3 , theorem 3 ) . to derive this relation ,",
    "observe that since the jacobian of the mapping @xmath209 is @xmath210 , we have @xmath211 for any @xmath212 .",
    "hence , the mapping @xmath213 is an isometry from @xmath199 into @xmath214 .",
    "this mapping is actually onto @xmath215 , with inverse @xmath216 .    next , from the reproducing property of @xmath203",
    ", it follows that for @xmath217 , @xmath218 if we make the change of variable @xmath209 , @xmath219 , this takes the form @xmath220 which , after multiplication by @xmath221 gives for @xmath222 that @xmath223 thus @xmath224 is the reproducing kernel for the space @xmath215 , which establishes ( [ eq : kk1-ti ] ) .    to obtain the formula for @xmath203 , we note that the polynomials @xmath225 form a complete orthonormal system in the space @xmath199 . therefore , we obtain the following representation : @xmath226 and the result ( [ kfinal - ti ] ) follows from ( [ eq : kk1-ti ] ) .",
    "* proof of theorem [ th2]*. with the above preparations we now turn to the proof of part ( a ) in theorem [ th2 ] .",
    "first , we need a good polynomial approximation of the kernel @xmath227 on @xmath15 , for fixed @xmath228 , where @xmath82 is a compact subset of @xmath9 . by the kellogg - warschawskii theorem ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "thus , @xmath233 on @xmath232 and ( [ kfinal - ti ] ) shows that the kernel @xmath227 is a @xmath234-smooth function on @xmath232 and the smoothness is uniform when @xmath235 lies in a compact subset @xmath82 of @xmath9 .",
    "consequently ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , there are polynomials @xmath236 of degree @xmath237 such that for @xmath228 @xmath238 where @xmath239 here and below denotes a positive constant , not necessarily the same at each appearance , that depends on @xmath232 and @xmath82 , but is independent of @xmath237 .",
    "therefore , the maximum modulus principle gives @xmath240    note that this provides a good approximation to @xmath241 only for @xmath242 .",
    "however , @xmath241 is also defined for @xmath243 , @xmath244",
    ". actually , as we have seen in ( [ eq : kk1-ti ] ) , for such values @xmath245 .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a good approximation to @xmath241 for all @xmath246 , we have to modify the polynomials @xmath247 . to this end",
    ", we note that since ( [ knt ] ) implies that the @xmath247 are bounded uniformly for @xmath242 , @xmath228 and @xmath248 , the bernstein - walsh lemma  @xcite implies that there is a constant @xmath249 such that @xmath250 since @xmath251 has an analytic continuation to an open set containing @xmath15 , it is known from the theory of polynomial approximation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that there exist polynomials @xmath252 of degree at most @xmath253 such that @xmath254 for some @xmath255 .    for some small @xmath256 we set @xmath257",

    "since @xmath263 is of degree smaller than @xmath31 , using the reproducing property of the kernel @xmath241 and the orthonormality of @xmath264 with respect to the inner product ( [ eq : innpro - ti ] ) , we conclude that @xmath265 therefore , from the cauchy - schwarz inequality and ( [ ktig - qn ] ) , we obtain the following uniform estimate for @xmath228 : @xmath266 where we recall that @xmath82 is a compact subset of @xmath9 . since this is true for any @xmath267 , we have shown that latexmath:[\\[\\label{k3 }    where now @xmath82 is any compact subset of @xmath0 .",
