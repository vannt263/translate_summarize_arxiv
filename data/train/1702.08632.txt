    "coulomb glass ( cg ) belongs to the class of disordered insulators .",
    "the electronic states in the system are localized due to disorder and are unable to screen the coulomb interactions effectively at low temperatures .",
    "some examples of such a system are amorphous semiconductors and impurity bands in doped semiconductors where the fermi level lies in the region of localized states .    in the absence of disorder , mbius and rssler @xcite",
    "have given evidence of phase transition from fluid to the charge - ordered phase ( cop ) in two and three dimensional cg . there finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis predicts that the values of the critical exponents are consistent with those of the ising model with short - range interactions .",
    "but at finite disorder , such a transition was seen in three dimensional ( 3d ) cg @xcite .",
    "later the phase diagram and the critical properties of 3d cg were also investigated by goethe and palassini @xcite .",
    "they found fluid to cop transition consistent with random field ising model ( rfim ) universality class . in our previous paper @xcite we provided numerical evidence of cop at finite disorder in two dimensional ( 2d )",
    "the investigations were done at zero temperature , where we found that the transition was driven by rearrangement of domain wall in the metastable state of cop as disorder was increased to give disordered phase . on the basis of this a two valley picture",
    "was proposed and phase coexistence was argued .",
    "this coupled with jump in the staggered magnetization at transition region was found as an indication of first order transition .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate the critical properties of 2d cg using finite size scaling at zero temperature .",
    "we have used monte carlo ( mc ) annealing and cluster - flipping algorithm to obtain the minimum energy state .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide sufficient evidence that the transition is , indeed first order .",
    "the distribution of staggered magnetization was investigated around the transition region to confirm the presence of coexisting phases .",
    "in addition to this , we have also investigated the properties of domains in the system at transition .    from the earlier studies done on rfim",
    "one can extract some useful conclusions about the phase transition and the properties of domains .",
    "one of the pioneer work in this field was done by imry and ma @xcite .",
    "they proposed that , if the spins within a domain of linear size @xmath7 are reversed , then the energy cost @xmath8 where @xmath9 is ferromagnetic interactions between the nearest neighbour spins and @xmath10 is the dimensionality of the system . reversing the spins yields gain in energy by an amount @xmath11 where h is the root - mean square deviation of the random fields .",
    "hence the energy needed to form a domain of linear size l in d dimensions is @xmath12 for @xmath13 , if @xmath14 then @xmath15 is positive but for @xmath16 , if @xmath7 is large enough then @xmath15 becomes negative .",
    "so the ferromagnetic ordering is unstable when @xmath16 . at @xmath17 , both the terms in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "[ introeq1 ] are of the order @xmath7 so the argument is inconclusive .",
    "later , binder @xcite gave an argument that , if one allows for roughening of the domain walls then there exists a length scale @xmath18 given by @xmath19\\ ] ] where c is a constant @xmath20 , for which @xmath21 becomes negative .",
    "so no long range order can exist for @xmath17 . a rigorous proof was later provided by aizenman and wehr @xcite , claiming absence of ferromagnetic ordering in 2d rfim .",
    "seppl et al @xcite numerically confirmed binder s roughening arguments and thus absence of any phase transition in 2d rfim .",
    "the existence of ferromagnetic ordering in 3d rfim was confirmed at finite @xcite as well as at zero temperature @xcite . from the standard picture",
    "@xcite one finds that the transition is second order , but there are few arguments in support of first order transition as well @xcite .",
    "recent work on 2d rfim @xcite also claim presence of ordered state in the system at finite disorder , but the nature of transition is not clear . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have given an argument that for a compact domain , the energy of formation of domain in cg system also scales as @xmath22 .",
    "we then used numerical data to show that the argument also holds for non - compact domains .",
    "we will here check whether the imry - ma arguments ( on domain structure and random field energy of the domain ) and the binder s argument ( on domain wall roughening ) are valid for cg system or not .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we will first discuss our model and then the numerical technique used to reach the minimum energy state . in section  [ sec5 ] results are shown where first a detailed study is done to prove discontinuity in magnetization and the critical exponent of correlation length ( @xmath23 ) and magnetization ( @xmath24 ) are computed .",
    "then the calculation of disconnected susceptibility is used to prove that the condition for second - order transition is not satisfied .",
    "we have then shown the distribution of staggered magnetization where three peaks are present at the critical disorder for all system sizes .",
    "the @xmath18 scaling derived for rfim @xcite is also discussed later for cg system .",
    "we have then studied the properties of the domains at transition where our results are in contradiction with the imry - ma arguments @xcite .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "the lattice model of cg was first discussed by efros and shklovskii @xcite , where the states were assumed to be localized around centres , on a regular lattice of @xmath25 sites . for the case where the number of electrons are half the total number of sites in the lattice , the hamiltonian can be considered as @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the electron occupation number which can take values 0 and 1 , as the on - site coulomb energy",
    "is assumed to be too large to permit more than one electron per site .",
    "the on - site energy @xmath28 at each site was considered as independent random variable with a probability distribution @xmath29 defined as @xmath30 the width @xmath31 of this distribution characterizes the amount of disorderedness in the system .",
    "the distance ( @xmath32 ) between sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 was calculated using periodic boundary conditions ( using minimum - image convention ) .",
    "the system under consideration possesses a particle - hole symmetry so the chemical potential @xmath35 .",
    "all the energies are measured in units of @xmath36 where @xmath37 is lattice spacing @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the dielectric constant of the medium .",
    "the minimum energy state was obtained using monte carlo annealing . to start the simulation we used a completely random initial configuration @xmath39 ( using ising spin variable @xmath40 ) where half the sites were randomly assigned with @xmath41 and the remaining half with @xmath42 . in our previous work @xcite , @xmath43",
    "were chosen in a correlated manner , i.e. for each run , @xmath43 were chosen from a box distribution @xmath44 and then multiplied by @xmath45 which was increased from 0 to 0.50 in small steps . in this paper at each @xmath31 , @xmath43 s were chosen independently from a box distribution given by eq  [ p1 ] .",
    "both type of simulations have been extensively done for rfim .",
    "metropolis algorithm @xcite was used which constitutes of random walk in space of all the possible configurations in the system .",
    "as the number of electrons is conserved , we have used kawasaki dynamics ( spin - exchange ) here . in this case a single monte carlo step ( mcs ) involves randomly choosing two sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 with opposite spins for spin exchange .",
    "if the state after spin exchange results into energy relaxation then the exchange is always done with the exchange probability @xmath46 but if the above mentioned condition is not satisfied i.e. the spin exchange results into thermal excitation by an amount say @xmath47 then the exchange probability is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the change in energy @xcite calculated using the single - particle hartree energy ( @xmath50 ) @xmath51 annealing was done from @xmath52 to @xmath53 for different system sizes ( @xmath54 ) . at low temperatures",
    "the number of mcs were increased to a maximum of @xmath55 at each temperature . for all system sizes ,",
    "investigations were done from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "system having same disorder realization but four different initial configurations . ]",
    "the minimum energy state obtained after mc annealing was then used to perform cluster analysis by hoshen - kopelman algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is used to identify domains ( clusters ) which are defined as a group of nearest neighbour spins with antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "we found that the system consisted of two large domains and few small domains and the interaction between these domains was negligible .",
    "so we flipped the domains one by one to reach a lower energy state .",
    "the final state thus obtained was then assumed as a ground state .",
    "we have also carried out the above mentioned simulation for the case where , same @xmath58 was considered for different initial configurations @xmath59 . the domains in the ground state for four different configurations are shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "one can see that the minimum energy states of all four configurations have the same domain structure and are pinned at a certain location .",
    "so using our method one can not find the true ground state but the minimum energy state found will be very close to the ground state .",
    "these different states should not be considered as metastable states ( states belonging to different valleys in a glass picture ) .",

    "<S> the lattice model of coulomb glass in two dimensions with box - type random field distribution is studied at zero temperature for system size upto @xmath0 . to obtain the minimum energy state we annealed the system using monte carlo simulation followed by further minimization using cluster - flipping . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the critical exponents are determined using the standard finite size scaling . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the correlation length @xmath1 diverges with an exponent @xmath2 at the critical disorder @xmath3 and that @xmath4 with @xmath5 for the disconnected susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> the staggered magnetization behaves discontinuously around the transition and the critical exponent of magnetization @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability distribution of the staggered magnetization shows a three peak structure which is a characteristic feature for the phase coexistence at first - order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this , at the critical disorder we have also studied the properties of the domain for different system sizes . in contradiction with the imry - ma arguments , we found pinned and non - compact domains where most of the random field energy was contained in the domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> our results are also inconsistent with binder s roughening picture . </S>"
