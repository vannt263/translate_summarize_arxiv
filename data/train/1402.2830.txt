    "it is manifested in , e.g. , the high - temperature tetragonal phases of the so - called cuprates : layered , ceramic materials that exhibit the phenomenon of high - temperature superconductivity  @xcite . in this particular system several studies were conducted only recently , experimentally probing its response to external gauge fields  @xcite to nematic ferromagnetism  @xcite and nonlinear conical diffraction  @xcite .",
    "the flat - band zero - energy edge modes in this lattice exhibit various peculiar features  @xcite and , hence , deserve particular attention .    here ,",
    "we analyze transport in lieb lattices theoretically and experimentally , in the bulk and at the edges .",
    "we demonstrate that whether or not flat - band modes are excited strongly impacts the transport in the bulk of the lattice . additionally , we demonstrate the presence of tamm - like edge states that arise at a van hove singularity in the band structure  @xcite .",
    "finally , we show that our photonic realization holds promise for a thorough analysis of various features of the lieb lattice in terms of transport at and far off the lattice edges .",
    "the structure of the lieb lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) , where it is evident that the unit cell consists of three sites @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . as in honeycomb lattices ( also known as  photonic graphene \" ) @xcite , the equation describing the propagation of light in this system is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the longitudinal propagation distance into the photonic lattice ( playing the role of time in the analogous schrdinger equation ) ; @xmath5 is the envelope of the electric field , defined by @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the electric field , @xmath8 the wavenumber in free space , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the speed of light in vacuum ) ; @xmath11 is the refractive index structure defining the photonic lattice , while @xmath12 is the refractive index of the material in which the lattice is embedded ; @xmath13 is the transverse laplacian operator ; @xmath14 as defined in equation ( 1 ) corresponds to the continuum hamiltonian for wave propagation in a photonic lattice . when the refractive index structure is composed of highly confined waveguides , each with a single bound state , we employ a tight - binding approximation .",
    "since within a given unit cell hopping takes place only between @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath1-@xmath2 nearest neighbors , the corresponding tight - binding hamiltonian reads @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 as the creation operators in the @xmath19-th unit cell on the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 sites , respectively .",
    "the summation takes place over @xmath20 ( the position of the unit cell ) , and @xmath21 ( the vectors connecting the neighbors via the inter - site coupling @xmath22 in the @xmath23- and @xmath24-direction , respectively ) . in",
    "fourier space , this becomes @xmath25 with @xmath26 ( first brillouin zone ) . from this ,",
    "one readily obtains the dispersion relation , i.e. , the spectrum @xmath27     and @xmath1 is described by @xmath28 ( horizontal direction ) , and between @xmath1 and @xmath2 by @xmath29 ( vertical direction ) .",
    "( b ) the dispersion relation of the isotropic lieb lattice ( @xmath30 ) in the tight - binding approximation ( eq.[tightbindingband ] ) shows three bands : a flat band at @xmath31 and two conically intersecting ones , with all three bands intersecting at the m point ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "( c ) microscope image of a laser - written lieb lattice in a fused silica glass wafer.[fig:1 ] ]    the full spectrum ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) for @xmath33 ) consists of three bands : a flat band ( @xmath34 ) and two conically intersecting bands , with all three bands intersecting at the m point ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "note that for each eigenstate at bloch wavevector @xmath35 in the top band with eigenvalue @xmath36 , there exists an eigenstate also at @xmath35 with eigenvalue @xmath37 ; this is known as particle - hole symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the finite lieb lattice with periodic and vanishing boundary conditions are given in ref .",
    "importantly , any superposition of eigenstates belonging to the flat band is also an eigenstate of the system , meaning that it is static and does not contribute to transport .",
    "equivalently , the group velocity in the flat band is zero at all bloch wave vectors , therefore any wavepacket is necessarily diffraction - free .",
    "consequently , to have transport , states in the other bands have to be excited .",
    "we also note that the flat band is not destroyed by any anisotropy @xmath38 , being an intrinsic property of this lattice in the nearest - neighbor coupling limit  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "linear modes of any periodic structure are completely extended . however",
    ", flat band systems allow the formation of very localized eigenmodes as a destructive linear combination of extended linear wavefunctions  @xcite . in the case of the lieb lattice , in any square of the lattice ( formed by four @xmath1 sites at the corners ,",
    "two @xmath2 sites at the upper and lower sides and two @xmath0 sites at the right and left sides of the square ) a stationary localized mode can be created by taking the four @xmath1 sites strictly zero , the two @xmath2 sites with an amplitude @xmath39 , while the last two @xmath0 with an amplitude @xmath40 and the rest of lattice sites are zero .    for our experiments ,",

    "a microscope front view of such a lattice , which consists of @xmath44 waveguides with nearest - neighbor spacing of 20@xmath45 m , is shown in fig .  [ fig:1](c ) .",
    "note that due to the slightly elliptical form of our waveguides , we find that the vertical inter - site coupling is slightly stronger than the horizontal one , i.e. the lattice is effectively uniaxially strained and anisotropic with @xmath46 . in our experiments , laser light at @xmath47 nm was launched into a single waveguide at the input facet of the array using a standard microscope objective . at the output facet of the sample ,",

    "the overlap with the eigenmodes in the three bands is shown in ( d ) for the @xmath0-site , ( e ) for the @xmath1-site , and ( f ) for the @xmath2-site .",
    "it is evident that transport is stronger when the flat band is least populated at the initial plane of excitation .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ]    we begin by launching light into the bulk of the lattice , i.e. , far away from the edges .",
    "as there are three elements per unit cell ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) , we study the propagation arising from excitations in each of the three positions @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding diffraction patterns obtained in our experiments are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:2](a),(c),(e ) .",
    "one can clearly see that the impact of the excitation location on the diffraction pattern is significant , depending on where in the unit cell the lattice is excited .",
    "the reason lies in the unique structure of the lieb lattice , where a single site excitation ( that corresponds to a unit impulse in real space ) does not excite all bands - in contrast to other lattices , like square , hexagonal or honeycomb lattices . to illustrate this effect ,",
    "we plot the projections @xmath48 of the impulse excitation @xmath49 at the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 sites on the eigenfunctions @xmath50 of the three bands ( @xmath51 is the band index ) in figs .",
    "[ fig:2](b),(d),(f ) , and compare them to the experimental data .",
    "it is evident that , when exciting the @xmath1 site [ fig .",
    "[ fig:2](e ) ] , the projections on the flat band are minimal ( equal to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the number of complete unit cells on one side of a finite square lieb lattice , i.e. , @xmath54 in our case ) and , hence , transport is strong . this",
    "is clearly observed in the experiment [ see  [ fig:2](b ) ] , where the light spreads across many lattice sites following the 10  cm propagation in the lattice . however , when exciting the @xmath0 site the situation changes drastically [ fig .",
    "[ fig:2](d ) ] . in this case",
    ", the projections on the flat band dominate and , therefore , the transport is minimal .",
    "the experiment shows exactly this : the spreading is very weak , and the light covers only a few lattice sites after propagating through the lattice [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) ] .",
    "intermediate spreading is observed when launching light into lattice site @xmath2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) , as a consequence of the partial overlap with the flat band [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](f ) ] .    at this point",
    "it is interesting to examine the transport through the lieb lattice when strain is applied .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that inhomogeneous strain applied to honeycomb lattices can give rise to landau level splitting @xcite , robust klein tunneling @xcite , topological transitions @xcite , and other unexpected phenomena .",
    "it is therefore instructive to look at the projections on the flat band as a function of the strain when exciting either the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 sites in the infinite lieb lattice .",
    "our calculations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "interestingly , when exciting a @xmath1 site , the population of the flat band always vanishes , for all values of the anisotropy .",
    "localized flat band modes have @xmath1 sites with zero amplitude , therefore launching light into this site will always result in strong transport , irrespective of the ratio @xmath55 . however , the situation is different for an excitation of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 sites .",
    "whereas for the isotropic case ( @xmath56 ) , the overlap with the flat band for both sites is exactly the same ( due to symmetry reasons ) , for the anisotropic case ( @xmath57 ) the flat band is more populated for an @xmath0-site excitation ( resulting in decreasing transport ) and less populated for a @xmath2-site excitation ( yielding enhanced transport ) .",
    "( anisotropic @xmath31 modes have @xmath58 , being therefore easier to excite them in sites @xmath0 ) .",
    "-site ( red dotted line ) , @xmath1-site ( green solid line ) , and @xmath2-site ( blue dashed line ) .",
    "[ fig:3],width=453 ]",
    "notwithstanding the bulk transport , we pay particular attention to the diffraction of light at the edge of the lattice .",
    "it is important to note that , within tight - binding model ( eq .  [ tightbindingmodel ] ) there are no edge states present , in the isotropic as well as in the anisotropic case . however , we surprisingly find that edge states arise in anisotropic lieb lattices in the continuous model ( eq .  [ continuousmodel ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](a ) we present a plot of the band structure at the edge of the lieb lattice by diagonalizing @xmath59 as given by eq .  [ continuousmodel ] , showing clearly the existence of states residing in the band gap that are localized at the lattice edge .",
    "the underlying mechanism for the formation of these edge states is similar to the one recently reported for `` photonic graphene ''  @xcite .",
    "note that these calculations are performed by full diagonalizing @xmath59 , as given in eq .",
    "[ continuousmodel ] , as opposed to simply examining the spectrum of the tight - binding model .    to explain these edge states in the lieb lattice , one has to take into account the fact that the effective on - site propagation constant of each mode is modified by its neighbouring sites .",
    "this modification differentiates between the @xmath1-sites in the bulk , where they have four neighbours , and the edge , where they have only three .",
    "although this difference is small and is usually neglected in tight - binding theories , it comes into play where the modes are highly degenerate at the van hove singularity . at the degeneracy point , any slight edge perturbation takes the edge mode out of the band and creates a tamm - like edge state as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) .",
    "we emphasize again that this state does not result from any real surface perturbation but rather from the specific surface structure along the edge .",
    "we classify this state as a `` tamm state ''  @xcite as opposed to a `` shockley state ''  @xcite , because it does not arise due to a band crossing , the criterion for the emergence of shockley states .",
    "it is important to note that these states do not have a topological origin , and only arise from the ` effective defect ' at the edge .",
    "although tamm states are conventionally associated with surface perturbations or defects ( that are inherent in the system , or that arise from modulation  @xcite ) , in the present case no defects whatsoever are present . instead , what happens here is that the edge itself acts as a sufficiently strong defect to localize light on the edge .",
    "this effect can not be accounted for in the standard tight - binding model and appears only in the continuum model .",
    "the experimental observation of strong edge diffraction in the anisotropic lieb lattice is presented in fig .",

    "[ fig:4 ] ]",
    "in conclusion , we presented a theoretical and experimental study of transport of light in photonic lieb lattices .",
    "we find that the transport in the bulk is significantly affected by which site in the unit cell is excited , due to different overlap with the flat band ( since any superposition of flat band states does not diffract and can form localized bulk states ) .",
    "importantly , an excitation of the @xmath1-site in the unit cell leaves the flat band essentially empty , resulting in maximal transport .",
    "we also show that the population of the different bands is a function of the anisotropy of the lattice .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate the existence of new edge states in anisotropic lieb lattices that arise due to a virtual defect at the lattice edges and are not manifested in the standard tight - binding model .",
