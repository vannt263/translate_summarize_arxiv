    "the network design problem is the problem of constructing a low cost network that satisfies given constraints .",
    "it includes many fundamental optimization problems , and has been extensively studied . in this paper",
    ", we consider a network design problem called the _",
    "generalized terminal backup problem _ , recently introduced by bernth and kobayashi  @xcite .",
    "the generalized terminal backup problem is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the sets of non - negative rational numbers and non - negative integers , respectively .",
    "let @xmath3 be an undirected graph with node set @xmath4 and edge set @xmath5 , @xmath6 be an edge cost function , and let @xmath7 be an edge capacity function .",
    "a subset @xmath8 of @xmath4 denotes the _ terminal _ node set in which each terminal @xmath9 is associated with a connectivity requirement @xmath10 .",
    "a solution is a multiple edge set on @xmath4 containing at most @xmath11 edges parallel to @xmath12 .",
    "the objective is to find a solution @xmath13 that minimizes @xmath14 under certain constraints . in bernth and kobayashi  @xcite",
    ", the subgraph @xmath15 was required to contain @xmath16 edge - disjoint paths that connect each @xmath17 to other terminals .",
    "in addition to these edge - connectivity constraints , we consider node - connectivity constraints , under which the paths must be inner disjoint ( i.e. , disjoint in edges and nodes in @xmath18 ) rather than edge - disjoint . to avoid confusion",
    ", we refer to the problem as _ edge - connectivity terminal backup _ when the edge - connectivity constraints are required , and as _ node - connectivity terminal backup _ when the node - connectivity constraints are imposed .",
    "when @xmath19 , the problem is called the _ terminal backup problem_. since there is no difference between edge - connectivity and node - connectivity when @xmath20 , these names make no confusion .",
    "the generalized terminal backup problem models a natural data management situation .",
    "suppose that each terminal represents a data storage server in a network , and @xmath16 is the amount of data stored in the server at a terminal @xmath9 .",
    "backup data must be stored in servers different from that storing the original data . to this end , a sub - network that transfers data stored at one terminal to other terminals is required .",
    "we assume that edges can transfer a single unit of data per time unit .",
    "hence , transferring data from terminal @xmath9 to other terminals within one time unit requires @xmath16 edge - disjoint paths from @xmath9 to @xmath21 , which is represented by the edge - connectivity constraints .",
    "when nodes are also capacitated , @xmath16 inner - disjoint paths are required ; these requirements are met by the node - connectivity constraints .",
    "the generalized terminal backup problem is interesting also from theoretical point of view .",
    "anshelevich and karagiozova  @xcite demonstrated that the terminal backup problem is reducible to the simplex matching problem , which is solvable in polynomial time . on the other hand , when @xmath22 , the generalized terminal backup problem is equivalent to the capacitated @xmath23-edge cover problem with degree lower bound @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "since the capacitated @xmath23-edge cover problem admits a polynomial - time algorithm , the generalized terminal backup problem is solvable in polynomial time also when @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , we may naturally ask whether the generalized terminal backup problem is solvable in polynomial time .",
    "bernth and kobayashi  @xcite proposed a polynomial - time algorithm for the uncapacitated case ( i.e. , @xmath26 for each @xmath12 ) in the edge - connectivity terminal backup .",
    "their result partially answers the above question , but their assumptions may be overly stringent in some situations ; that is , their algorithm admits unfavorable solutions that select too many copies of a cheap edge .",
    "moreover , their algorithm can not deal with the node - connectivity constraints .",
    "unfortunately , when the edge - capacities are bounded or node - connectivity constraints are imposed , we do not know whether the generalized terminal backup problem is np - hard or admits a polynomial - time algorithm .",
    "instead , we propose approximation algorithms as follows .",
    "[ thm : main-4/3 ] there exist a strongly polynomial - time @xmath0-approximation algorithm for the generalized terminal backup problem .",
    "the present study contributes two major advances to the generalized terminal backup problem .",
    "* bernth and kobayashi  @xcite discussed the generalized terminal backup problem in the uncapacitated setting with edge - connectivity constraints , noting that the problem in the capacitated setting is open . here",
    ", we discuss the capacitated setting , and introduce the node - connectivity constraints . *",
    "the generalized terminal backup problem can be formulated as the problem of covering skew supermodular biset functions , which is known to admit a 2-approximation algorithm . on the other hand , as stated in theorem  [ thm : main-4/3 ] , we develop @xmath0-approximation algorithms , that outperform this 2-approximation algorithm .",
    "let us explain the second advance more specifically .",
    "given an edge set @xmath13 and a nonempty subset @xmath27 of @xmath4 , let @xmath28 denote the set of edges in @xmath13 with one end node in @xmath27 and the other in @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be a function such that @xmath31 if @xmath32 , and @xmath33 otherwise . by the edge - connectivity version of menger s theorem",
    ", @xmath13 satisfies the edge - connectivity constraints if and only if @xmath34 for each @xmath35 .",
    "bernth and kobayashi  @xcite showed that the function @xmath36 is skew supermodular ( skew supermodularity is defined in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] ) . for any skew supermodular set function @xmath37 ,",
    "jain  @xcite proposed a seminal @xmath38-approximation algorithm for computing a minimum - cost edge set @xmath13 satisfying @xmath39 , @xmath35 .",
    "although the node - connectivity constraints can not be captured by set functions as the edge - connectivity constraints , they can be regarded as a request for covering a skew supermodular _ biset _ function , to which the 2-approximation algorithm is extended  @xcite ( see section  [ sec : preliminaries ] ) .",
    "therefore , the generalized terminal backup problem admits 2-approximation algorithms , regardless of the imposed connectivity constraints .",
    "one of our contributions is to improve these 2-approximations to @xmath0-approximations .",
    "both of the above 2-approximation algorithms involve iterative rounding of the linear programming ( lp ) relaxations .",
    "primarily , their performance analyses prove that the value of a variable in each extreme point solution of the lp relaxations is at least @xmath40 .",
    "once this property of extreme point solutions is proven , the variables can be repeatedly rounded until a 2-approximate solution is obtained .",
    "our @xmath0-approximation algorithms are based on the same lp relaxations as the iterative rounding algorithms .",
    "we show that , in the generalized terminal backup problem , all variables in extreme point solutions of the relaxation take half - integral values .",
    "we also prove that the half - integral solution can be rounded into an integer solution with loss of factor at most @xmath0 .",
    "it may be helpful for understanding our result to see the well - studied special case of @xmath22 and @xmath41 for each @xmath12 ( i.e. , feasible solutions are simple @xmath42-edge covers ) . in this case ,",
    "our lp relaxation minimizes @xmath43 subject to @xmath44 for each @xmath25 and @xmath45 for each @xmath12 , where @xmath46 is the set of edges incident to the node @xmath47 .",
    "it has been already known that an extreme point solution of this lp is half - integral , and the edges in @xmath48 form odd cycles .",
    "the half - integral variables of the edges on an odd cycle can be rounded as follows .",
    "suppose that edges @xmath49 appear in the cycle in this order , where @xmath50 is the cycle length ( i.e. , odd integer larger than one ) .",
    "for each @xmath51 , we define @xmath52 if @xmath53 and @xmath54 , or if @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and @xmath57 otherwise .",
    "see figure  [ fig.oddcicle ] . for an illustration of this definition .",
    "note that exactly @xmath58 variables in @xmath59 are equal to one , and the other @xmath60 variables are equal to zero for each @xmath61 .",
    "this means that @xmath62 let @xmath63 minimize @xmath64 in @xmath65 .",
    "then , since @xmath66 , replacing @xmath67 by @xmath68 increases their costs by a factor at most @xmath69 .",
    "we also observe that the feasibility of the solution is preserved even after the replacement . by applying this rounding for each odd cycle",
    ", the half - integral solution can be transformed into a @xmath0-approximate integer solution .    , and",
    "a solid thick line represents @xmath52 . ]",
    "our result is obtained by extending the characterization of the edge structure whose corresponding variables are not integers , but the extension is not immediate . as in the above special case , those edges form cycles in the generalized terminal backup problem if the solution is a minimal feasible solution to the lp relaxation .",
    "however , the length of a cycle is not necessarily odd , and it is not clear how the half - integral solution should be rounded ; in the above special case , we round up and down variables of edges on a cycle alternatively , but this obviously does not preserve the feasibility in the generalized terminal backup problem .",
    "the key ingredient in our result is to characterize the relationship between the cycles and the node sets or bisets corresponding to linearly independent tight constraints in the lp relaxation .",
    "we show that a cycle crosses maximal tight node set or bisets an odd number of times , which extends the property that the length of each cycle is odd in the special case .",
    "our rounding algorithm decides how to round a non - integer variable from the direction of the crossing between the corresponding edge and a tight node set or biset .",
    "multiflows are closely related to the generalized terminal backup problem . among the many multiflow variants , we focus on the type sometimes called _ free multiflows_. for @xmath70 , @xmath71 denotes the set of paths that terminate at @xmath9 and @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath73 denote @xmath74 , and @xmath75 denote @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the sets of edges and nodes in @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "we define a multiflow as a function @xmath80 . in the edge - capacitated",
    "setting , an edge capacity @xmath81 is given , and we must satisfy @xmath82 for each @xmath12 . in the node - capacitated",
    "setting , a node capacity @xmath83 is given and @xmath84 is required for each @xmath25 .",
    "the multiflow @xmath85 is called an _ integral _",
    "multiflow if @xmath86 for each @xmath79 , and is called a _",
    "half - integral _ multiflow if @xmath87 for each @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath88 denote @xmath89 for @xmath79 .",
    "the cost of @xmath85 is given by @xmath90 .",
    "in the edge - connectivity terminal backup , the connectivity requirement from a terminal @xmath9 equates to requiring that a flow of amount @xmath16 can be delivered from @xmath9 to @xmath21 in the graph @xmath15 with unit edge - capacities if @xmath13 is a feasible solution .",
    "this condition appears similar to the constraint that the graph @xmath15 with unit edge - capacities admits a multiflow @xmath85 such that @xmath91 .",
    "we note that @xmath15 with unit edge - capacities admits a multiflow @xmath85 if and only if the number of copies of @xmath12 in @xmath13 is at least @xmath92 .",
    "these observations suggest a correspondence between the edge - connectivity terminal backup and the problem of finding a minimum cost multiflow @xmath85 under the constraint that @xmath91 for @xmath17 in the edge - capacitated setting .",
    "we refer to such a multiflow computation as the _ minimum cost multiflow problem _ ( in the edge - capacitated setting ) .",
    "the same correspondence exists between the node - connectivity terminal backup and the node - capacitated setting in the minimum cost multiflow problem",
    ".    however , the generalized terminal backup and the minimum cost multiflow problems are not equivalent .",
    "especially , the minimum cost multiflow problem can be formulated in lp , whereas the generalized terminal backup problem is an integer programming problem . even if multiflows are restricted to integral multiflows ,",
    "the two problems are not equivalent . to observe this , let @xmath3 be a star with an odd number of leaves .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 is the set of leaves , and each edge incurs one unit of cost .",
    "this star is a feasible solution to the terminal backup problem ( i.e. , @xmath93 for @xmath17 ) .",
    "in contrast , setting @xmath20 and @xmath94 admits no integral multiflow in the edge - capacitated setting , and no feasible ( fractional ) multiflows in the node - capacitated setting .",
    "nevertheless , similarities exist between terminal backups and multiflows . as mentioned above",
    ", we will show that an lp relaxation of the generalized terminal backup problem always admits a half - integral optimal solution .",
    "similarly , half - integrality results are frequently reported for multiflows .",
    "lovsz  @xcite and cherkassky  @xcite investigated @xmath95 in the edge - capacitated setting , and showed that a half - integral multiflow maximizes @xmath96 over all multiflows @xmath85 . using an identical objective function to ours ,",
    "karzanov  @xcite sought to minimize the cost of multiflows .",
    "his feasible multiflow solutions are those attaining @xmath97 in the edge - capacitated setting with @xmath95 , and he showed that the minimum cost is achieved by a half - integral multiflow .",
    "babenko and karzanov  @xcite and hirai  @xcite extended karzanov s result to node - cost minimization in the node - capacitated setting .",
    "in this scenario also , the optimal multiflow is half - integral .    in the present paper ,",
    "we present a useful relationship between the generalized terminal backup problem and the minimum cost multiflow problem in the edge - capacitated setting .",
    "we prove that the optimal solution of the lp used to approximate the edge - connectivity terminal backup is a half - integral multiflow , which also optimizes the minimum cost multiflow problem .",
    "thereby , we can compute the minimum cost half - integral multiflow by solving the lp relaxation .",
    "this result is summarized in the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : flow ] the minimum cost multiflow problem admits a half - integral optimal solution in the edge - capacitated setting , which can be computed in strongly polynomial time .",
    "in contrast , we find no useful relationship between the node - connectivity terminal backup and the node - capacitated setting of the minimum cost multiflow problem .",
    "we can only show that the lp relaxation of the node - connectivity terminal backup also has an optimal solution which is a half - integral multiflow in the edge - capacitated setting .    despite its natural formulation ,",
    "the minimum cost multiflow problem has not been previously investigated to our knowledge .",
    "we emphasize that theorem  [ thm : flow ] can not be derived from previously known results on multiflows .",
    "the minimum cost multiflow problem may be solvable by reducing it to minimum cost maximum multiflow problems that ( as mentioned above ) admit polynomial - time algorithms .",
    "a naive reduction can be implemented as follows .",
    "let @xmath98 be a minimum cost multiflow that satisfies the flow demands from terminals , and let @xmath99 for each @xmath17 .",
    "for each @xmath17 , we add a new node @xmath72 and connect @xmath9 and @xmath72 by a new edge of capacity @xmath100 .",
    "the new terminal set @xmath101 is defined as @xmath102 .",
    "now the multiflow @xmath98 can be extended to the multiflow of maximum flow value for the terminal set @xmath101 . applying the algorithm in  @xcite to this new instance",
    ", we can solve the original problem .",
    "moreover , if @xmath100 is an integer for each @xmath17 , this reduction together with the half - integrality result in @xcite implies that an optimal multiflow in the minimum cost multiflow problem is half - integral .",
    "however , this naive reduction has two limitations .",
    "first , @xmath100 is indeterminable without computing @xmath98 .",
    "we only know that @xmath100 can not be smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "second , we can not ascertain that @xmath100 is always an integer for each @xmath17 .",
    "hence , this naive reduction seems to yield neither a polynomial - time algorithm nor the half - integrality of optimal multiflows claimed in theorem  [ thm : flow ] .    applying a structural result in  @xcite on the generalized terminal backup problem",
    ", it is easily shown that any integral solution to the edge - connectivity terminal backup provides a half - integral multiflow at the same cost .",
    "however , since the way to find an optimal solution for the edge - connectivity terminal backup is unknown , theorem  [ thm : flow ] is not derivable from this relationship . in proving the half - integrality of the lp relaxation required for theorem  [ thm : main-4/3 ]",
    ", we immediately imply the quarter - integrality of a minimum cost multiflow ( i.e. , @xmath103 for each @xmath79 ) .",
