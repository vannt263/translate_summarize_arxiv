    "ao  0235 + 164 is an extensively studied bl lac object at redshift @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the object is seen through a foreground group of galaxies at @xmath2 responsible for spectral lines in both absorption and emission .",
    "absorption lines from @xmath3 are also present in the spectrum .",
    "the source is highly variable over the whole electromagnetic spectrum from radio to @xmath4-rays .",
    "variability time scales from years to days are observed , as well as intra - day variability .",
    "see e.g. @xcite and references therein for a detailed account of the optical and radio variability studies of ao  0235 + 164 over the past three decades .",
    "the high - resolution radio structure of the source at milli - arcsecond ( mas ) angular scales revealed by ground - based very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) is characterized by a dominant compact core .",
    "occasionally , faint extensions are seen at various position angles mainly between the north and east .",
    "a collection of references to earlier vlbi observations is given by @xcite .",
    "based on a series of 43-ghz very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations spanning almost two years , @xcite recently claimed to identify two components well within 1  mas of the core that show apparent superluminal motion with speeds up to @xmath5 .",
    "this would imply a doppler factor of at least 90 in the jet when it points directly to the observer . such high doppler factors ( @xmath6 )",
    "were reported by @xcite based on radio variability measurements , and by @xcite derived from vlbi and radio total flux density observations .",
    "the result is also consistent with our earlier first - epoch 5-ghz vlbi space observatory programme ( vsop ) imaging observation @xcite .",
    "we derived a lower limit to the brightness temperature , @xmath0  k , based on an unresolved core component .",
    "this is the highest value measured directly and implies a doppler factor of @xmath6 .",
    "however , the doppler boosting also varies with time as can be inferred from the brightness temperatures derived from vlbi data @xcite .",
    "this , and the large changes in the apparent vlbi jet position angle are qualitatively well explained by small deviations in a jet that intrinsically points very close to the line of sight . indeed , @xcite interpreted the long - term quasi - periodic variability of ao  0235 + 164 at multiple wavebands as orientation variations in a helical jet . in their model , non - periodic features are explained by flow instabilities .",
    "short timescale ( intra - hour ) variability data taken in 2000 are best interpreted by invoking interstellar scintillation of a source of at least 0.015  mas in angular size , implying a doppler factor smaller than 40 in the relativistically moving component @xcite .",
    "as opposed to other bl lac objects , high - resolution radio polarization studies using ground - based vlbi at 5  ghz @xcite and 8.4  ghz @xcite found no convincing structure in either total or polarized intensity apart from the compact core of ao  0235 + 164 .",
    "our vsop monitoring observations presented here were aimed at investigating how the sub - mas scale radio structure of ao  0235 + 164 varies , and to see whether linear polarization structure can be detected with the superior angular resolution offered by vsop at the frequencies of 1.6 and 5  ghz . the vsop satellite , halca , receives only left - circularly polarized radiation , and has a limited sensitivity compared to ground - based vlbi stations . however , dual - polarization experiments with the co - observing ground network ( e.g. the vlba ) allow polarization imaging of sources that show sufficiently high correlated polarized flux density @xcite .",

    "the visibility amplitudes were calibrated using system temperatures measured at the antennas wherever available .",
    "nominal values were applied for halca and occasionally for some ground antennas ( ar , at and ud ) . due to the sufficiently large ground network in most experiments ,",

    "fringe - fitting was performed with the aips task fring over 5-minute solution intervals .",
    "the total intensity images are the results of a hybrid mapping procedure involving several iterations with the tasks calib and imagr .",
    "the fourth root of the visibility data weights were used in a uniform weighting scheme in order to increase the relative importance of the baselines to the orbiting radio telescope and hence to improve the angular resolution .",

    "no image is presented for the 5-ghz observation on 2001 aug 14 ( experiment g ) , because only single baselines were available for most of the time .",
    "however , the source was clearly detected on each baseline and the data are consistent with a slightly resolved compact component .",
    "for the polarization experiments , the task lpcal was used to solve for instrumental polarization terms for the antennas .",
    "absolute calibration of the polarization position angle was possible for experiments e and f. the calibrator source 0048 - 097 was observed with the ground antennas .",
    "integrated polarization measurements for the calibrator were obtained from the nrao very large array ( vla ) involved in the svlbi experiment as a phased array ( epoch e ) , and from the umrao monitoring ( epoch f ) . in the latter case , due to a 2-month period between our epoch and the data base entry ,",

    "at 1.6  ghz , the total intensity images of ao  0235 + 164 ( fig .  [ svlbi - image-1.6 ] ) obtained at epochs b and c separated by 6 months in time show a resolved and somewhat extended structure .",
    "the low - brightness extension is on the eastern side of the compact core .",
    "the fractional polarization of the core was @xmath13% .    at 5  ghz , in contrast to our earlier results ( epoch d , @xcite ) ,",
    "the source is well resolved on the space  ground baselines at three different epochs .",
    "this is clearly indicated by the plots of the correlated flux density as a function of the projected baseline length ( fig .",
    "[ svlbi - radpl-5 ] ) . although there are hints of sub - mas scale structure in the images , these are difficult to interpret due to the highly elongated restoring beam , a consequence of the asymmetric ( @xmath14)-coverage . in fact , the source brightness distribution is well fitted with a single circular gaussian component of 0.20 , 0.30 and 0.23  mas ( fwhm ) in the case of experiments e , f and h , respectively .",
    "these values imply brightness temperatures of @xmath15  k , more than an order of magnitude less than that derived in 1999 , shortly after a major total flux density outburst @xcite .",
    "the source has apparently become extended and , according to the umrao total flux density monitoring data , also faded since 1999 .",
    "our monitoring epochs fall into a long , relatively quiescent period in the flux density history of ao  0235 + 164 ( fig .",
    "[ fluxhistory ] ) .",
    "the nearly contemporaneous 5-ghz total flux density measurements are indicated with horizontal dashed lines in the correlated flux density plots ( fig .",
    "[ svlbi - radpl-5 ] ) for comparison .",
    "it is interesting to note that the correlated flux densities on the shortest vlbi baselines are considerably lower than the total flux densities , by up to @xmath16  mjy ( epochs e , f ) .",
    "this phenomenon is often encountered at different epochs and frequencies by other authors as well . in particular , @xcite lists ao  0235 + 164 as one of the `` compact but slightly resolved '' sources found in the vlba 2-cm survey sample , suggesting that a weak extended emission is associated with a jet structure seen more or less face - on . in the framework of this survey , @xcite derived @xmath17  k at 15  ghz at the epoch of 2001 mar 15 , consistently with our results discussed here .      since the phased vla was included in the ground network in our 5-ghz experiment on 2001 feb 2 ( epoch e ) , we were also able to image ao  0235 + 164 using only vla data",
    ". our vla image ( fig .",
    "[ vla - image ] ) with about 3 orders of magnitude less resolution than that of the svlbi images shows weak extended emission surrounding the core , reaching 0.1% of the peak brightness in a component at an angular distance of to the north - northwest .",
    "the structure seen is similar to earlier vla results @xcite . unlike the vlbi data , the vla observations fully account for the total flux density .",
    "about 10  mjy flux density can be attributed to the extended structure in the vla image .",
    "we believe that diffuse low surface brightness emission is present on intermediate angular scales , but is resolved out by vlbi .    as argued by e.g. @xcite , the radio jet in ao  0235 + 164 may lie very close ( within @xmath18 ) to the line of sight .",
    "it is possible that this angle changes with a period of @xmath19 years @xcite , as in the helical jet model proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , the next major radio outburst predicted by the model for around early 2004 has yet to be detected @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , this explains a wide range of phenomena observed in the source , including ( some ) variability , rapid changes in the vlbi jet component position angles ( when observed ) , and the diffuse radio emission surrounding the core at larger scales . in this picture",
    ", our svlbi monitoring covers a period post-1999 that corresponds to a larger jet angle with respect to the line of sight , and therefore a less dominant doppler boosting . with the jet doppler factor",
    "@xmath20 determined in 1999 , the lorentz factor characterising the bulk plasma motion is @xmath21 , and the corresponding jet viewing angle is @xmath22 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) . at our later epochs , the doppler boosting decreased by a factor of @xmath23 . under the simple assumption that the bulk lorentz factor remained similar , the observed change in the brightness temperature can be explained by an increase in @xmath24 as small as @xmath25 .    at our monitoring epochs ,",
    "the fractional polarization of ao  0235 + 164 was quite low , @xmath26% .",
    "this result is fully consistent with the corresponding umrao monitorig data , where the polarized flux density was measured to be around the detection limit at these epochs .",
    "historically , values as high as @xmath27% have been measured for ao  0235 + 164 . besides the low level of polarization , the structure found is simple , no feature apart from the compact core is being seen in our polarization images .",
    "this rather atypical property of ao  0235 + 164 compared to other bl lac objects has already been noted by @xcite and @xcite using ground - based vlbi data . in this `` inactive '' phase",
    "the degree of ordering of the magnetic field in the source is low and no propagating shock is emerging in the plasma flow .",
    "svlbi observations of other bl lac objects ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) resolve the polarization structure of the inner jet components .",
    "this is typically aligned with the jet axis , suggesting that the jets are associated with helical magnetic fields that propogate outward with the jet flow .",
