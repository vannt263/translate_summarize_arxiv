    "in 1918 schottky @xcite reported that in ideal vacuum tubes , where all sources of spurious noise had been eliminated , there remained two types of noise in the electrical current , described by him as the _ wrmeeffekt _ and the _ schroteffekt_. the first type of noise became known as johnson - nyquist noise ( after the experimentalist @xcite and the theorist @xcite who investigated it ) , or simply thermal noise .",
    "it is due to the thermal motion of the electrons and occurs in any conductor .",
    "the second type of noise is called shot noise , caused by the discreteness of the charge of the carriers of the electrical current .",
    "not all conductors exhibit shot noise .",
    "noise is characterized by its spectral density or power spectrum @xmath3 , which is the fourier transform at frequency @xmath4 of the current - current correlation function @xcite , @xmath5 here @xmath6 denotes the time - dependent fluctuations in the current at a given voltage @xmath7 and temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the brackets @xmath9 indicate an ensemble average or , equivalently , an average over the initial time @xmath10 . both thermal and shot noise",
    "have a white power spectrum  that is , the noise power does not depend on @xmath4 over a very wide frequency range . thermal noise ( @xmath11 )",
    "is directly related to the conductance @xmath12 by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite , @xmath13 as long as @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the thermal noise of a conductor does not give any new information .",
    "shot noise ( @xmath15 ) is more interesting , because it gives information on the temporal correlation of the electrons , which is not contained in the conductance . in devices such as tunnel junctions , schottky barrier diodes , @xmath16-@xmath17 junctions , and thermionic vacuum diodes @xcite , the electrons are transmitted randomly and independently of each other .",
    "the transfer of electrons can be described by poisson statistics , which is used to analyze events that are uncorrelated in time . for these devices",
    "the shot noise has its maximum value @xmath18 proportional to the time - averaged current @xmath19 .",
    "( we assume @xmath20 and @xmath21 throughout this review . )",
    "equation ( [ q1b.4 ] ) is valid for @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the width of a one - electron current pulse . for higher frequencies the shot noise vanishes .",
    "correlations suppress the low - frequency shot noise below @xmath24 .",
    "one source of correlations , operative even for non - interacting electrons , is the pauli principle , which forbids multiple occupancy of the same single - particle state .",
    "a typical example is a ballistic point contact in a metal , where @xmath25 because the stream of electrons is completely correlated by the pauli principle in the absence of impurity scattering .",
    "macroscopic , metallic conductors have zero shot noise for a different reason , namely that inelastic electron - phonon scattering averages out the current fluctuations .",
    "progress in nanofabrication technology has revived the interest in shot noise , because nanostructures allow measurements to be made on `` mesoscopic '' length scales that were previously inaccessible .",
    "the mesoscopic length scale is much greater than atomic dimensions , but small compared to the scattering lengths associated with various inelastic processes .",
    "mesoscopic systems have been studied extensively through their conductance .",
    "noise measurements are much more difficult , but the sensitivity of the experiments has made a remarkable progress in the last years .",
    "some theoretical predictions have been observed , while others still remain an experimental challenge .",
    "this article is a review of the present status of the field , with an emphasis on the theoretical developments .",

    "this has become a key concept in mesoscopic physics .",
    "the conductor is modeled as a scattering region , connected to electron reservoirs .",
    "the electrons inside each reservoir are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "incoming states , occupied according to the fermi - dirac distribution function , are scattered into outgoing states . at low temperatures",
    "the conductance is fully determined by the transmission matrix of electrons at the fermi level .",
    "the two - terminal landauer formula @xcite and its multi - terminal generalization @xcite constitute a general framework for the calculation of the conductance of a phase - coherent sample . a scattering theory of the noise properties of mesoscopic conductors",
    "was derived in refs .",
