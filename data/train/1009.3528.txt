    "during the past decade the gravitational average action @xcite has been used both as a framework within which the asymptotic safety scenario for a consistent microscopic quantum theory of gravity can be tested @xcite-@xcite and as a convenient tool for finding the leading quantum gravity corrections to various classical spacetimes .",
    "the latter investigations exploited the effective field theory properties of the average action @xmath2 in an essential way .",
    "it can be regarded as a one parameter family of effective field theories , one for each value of the built - in infrared cutoff @xmath3 @xcite-@xcite . in single scale problems involving a typical covariant momentum scale @xmath3",
    "a tree - level evaluation of @xmath2 encapsulates the leading quantum effects at this scale .",
    "thanks to this property the running couplings contained in @xmath2 can be used in order to `` renormalization group improve '' the classical field equations or solutions thereof @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the possibility of interpreting @xmath2 as a `` running effective field theory '' distinguishes the effective average action @xcite from alternative functionals satisfying exact renormalization group ( rg ) equations .",
    "the functional evolved by polchinski 's equation , for instance , has the interpretation of a bare action .",
    "therefore it can not be used for `` improvement '' purposes in the same way @xcite .    knowing the gravitational average action with some accuracy ( i.e. , in some truncation ) means that we know the scale dependence of a set of generalized gravitational couplings ; typically it includes newton 's constant , for instance .",
    "these running couplings can be used in order to `` rg improve '' classical spacetimes .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "one starts by picking a solution of the classical field equation .",
    "this solution will in general depend on the classical gravitational couplings .",
    "then one replaces the classical ones by their @xmath3-dependent counterparts and tries to express the value of @xmath3 by means of a `` cutoff identification '' in terms of the relevant geometrical or dynamical scale .    in refs .",
    "@xcite this approach has been applied to stationary and spherically symmetric , uncharged black holes .",
    "the classical starting point was the schwarzschild metric which involves the classical newton 's constant @xmath4 in the familiar way .",
    "the improvement consisted in replacing the classical @xmath4 by the running newton 's constant @xmath5 obtained from the functional  rg equation for the effective average action .",
    "a subtle point is finding a suitable cutoff identification .",
    "it should be chosen in such a way that higher values of @xmath3 correspond to a `` zooming '' into the details of the black hole .",
    "one can try to find a meaningful identification in the form @xmath6 which associates scales to spacetime points @xmath7 .",
    "it is plausible that this map should be such that @xmath3 is smaller ( larger ) at larger ( smaller ) distances from the center of the black hole . in the analogous situation in",
    "flat space one would set @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the radial distance ; with this identification one can obtain the quantum corrected coulomb potential from the @xmath3-dependence of the fine structure constant , for instance",
    ". in gravity the assignment of scales to points should be diffeomorphism invariant , i.e. upon introducing coordinates @xmath10 the relationship @xmath6 should be represented by a _",
    "function @xmath11 . in @xcite",
    "the following class of cutoff identification was considered : @xmath12 @xmath13 here @xmath14 is a constant of order unity and @xmath15 is a distance scale typical of the point @xmath7 .",
    "according to ( [ 1.1b ] ) it is given by the length of a certain curve @xmath16 .",
    "this curve is supposed to end at @xmath7 , and to start at some reference point @xmath17 .",
    "the line element @xmath18 refers to the classical metric . while diffeomorphism invariant by construction , the above ansatz is still very general and different choices are possible for @xmath16 .",
    "they correspond to different ways of `` re - focusing '' the `` microscope '' with which spacetime is observed when one goes from one point to another . in refs .",
    "@xcite a straight radial line from the center to the point @xmath7 has been employed , and this choice has been motivated in detail . the only running parameter considered in this analysis was newton 's constant .",
    "its @xmath3-dependence had been assumed to be given by the formula @xmath19 here @xmath4 is the classical ( macroscopic ) newton 's constant , and @xmath20 is a positive constant .",
    "this equation is a rather precise approximation to @xmath5 as obtained from the einstein - hilbert truncation @xcite for all rg trajectories with a negligible cosmological constant in the classical regime . according to ( [ 1.2 ] ) , the running newton 's constant interpolates between @xmath4 for @xmath21 and the non - gaussian fixed point behavior @xmath22 for @xmath23 . with ( 1.1 )",
    "inserted into ( [ 1.2 ] ) we obtain the position dependent newton 's constant @xmath24 with @xmath25",
    ".    the rg improved schwarzschild metric was obtained by replacing @xmath26 in the classical metric .",
    "it has been analysed in great detail in @xcite .",
    "in particular , its horizon structure was investigated .",
    "one finds that besides the usual schwarzschild horizon there exists a new inner horizon which merges with the ( standard ) outer one at a critical value of the mass .",
    "an `` extremal '' black hole of this kind has vanishing hawking temperature .",
    "in fact the improvement suggests a very attractive scenario for the final state of black hole evaporation : in the early stages the temperature increases with decreasing mass , as predicted by the conventional semiclassical analysis .",
    "however , once the mass approaches the planck mass , the quantum gravity effects reduce the temperature , and ultimately `` switch off '' the hawking radiation . for further details on the rg improved schwarzschild black hole we refer to @xcite and to @xcite where a dynamical picture of the evaporation process by means of a quantum corrected vaidya metric has been developed .",
    "the generalization to higher dimensions was considered in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to perform a similar analysis for rotating black holes .",
    "we shall construct and analyse an rg - improved version of the kerr metric . in boyer - lindquist",
    "coordinates the classical kerr metric reads @xcite @xmath27 here we used the traditional abbreviations @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 kerr black holes are characterized by two parameters , their mass @xmath31 and angular momentum @xmath32 @xcite .    applying the method outlined above we shall `` improve '' @xmath33 by replacing @xmath34 and using a cutoff identification of the type ( [ 1.1 ] ) . to start with , we are going to analyse various plausible curves @xmath16 , including a straight radial line again , and discuss their physical properties .",
    "the classical kerr spacetime has two spherical horizons @xmath35 at the radii @xcite @xmath36 and two static limit surfaces @xmath37 at @xmath38 ( here @xmath39 denotes the `` geometric mass '' which actually has the dimension of a length . )",
    "we shall discuss in detail the analogous critical surfaces ( horizons and static limit surfaces ) of the improved metric .",
    "in particular we demonstrate that , contrary to the schwarzschild case , the improvement does not lead to the formation of additional horizons .",
    "as compared to the schwazschild metric , the kerr spacetime displays several new features which are interesting from a conceptual point of view .",
    "one of them is the existence of an ergosphere and the possibility of extracting energy from the black hole via the penrose process @xcite .",
    "we shall analyse in detail how the quantum gravity effects influence the structure of the ergosphere and the `` phase space '' available for the penrose process .",
    "another new feature of the kerr spacetime becomes apparent when one asks whether the improved black holes still satisfy a set of ( quantum corrected ) laws of black hole thermodynamics . in full generality",
    "this is an extremely difficult question .",
    "here we can only analyze whether there exists an entropy - like state function satisfying a modified version of the first law . in the case of kerr black holes",
    "the space of states , labeled by @xmath31 and @xmath40 , is 2-dimensional . as a result",
    ", it turns out that the mere _ existence _ of an entropy is a non - trivial issue .",
    "( for the schwarzschild metric the space is 1-dimensional and so the existence of an entropy for the improved black hole is guaranteed . )",
    "we shall see that , within the present approach , a state function with the interpretation of an entropy can exist only if the corresponding hawking temperature is no longer proportional to the surface gravity , as it is semiclassically . at least in the limit of small angular momentum we shall find unambiguously defined relations @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the temperature and entropy of the improved rotating black holes .",
    "the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the cutoff identification we are going to employ , and in section 3 we introduce the rg improved kerr metric and analyse some of its general properties ; in particular we derive formulas for the modified static limit and horizon surfaces , we reexpress the metric in a set of appropiately generalized eddington - finkelstein coordinates , and compute the surface gravity of the rotating quantum black holes .",
    "then , in section 4 and 5 we analyse the detailed structure of the critical surfaces and the phase space of the penrose mechanism ( negative energy states ) , respectively , usign both analytical and numerical methods . in section 6",
    "we reinterprete the improved vacuum black hole as a classical one in presence of a certain kind of fictitious matter which mimicks the quantum effects , and we investigate the positivity properties of this matter system . in section 7",
    "we show how the `` bare '' mass and angular momentum of these black holes get `` dressed '' by the quantum effects in according with the antiscreening character of quantum einstein gravity .",
    "finally , in section [ seccion 8 ] we take a first step towards an rg improved black hole thermodynamics ; in particular we derive a modified first law satisfied by the improved kerr black holes .",
    "section 9 contains a summary of the results .",
    "after replacing @xmath34 we would like to express the scale @xmath3 as a scalar function on spacetime so that newton 's constant becomes position dependent : @xmath43 here we have indicated that for symmetry reasons @xmath3 and @xmath44 can depend on the boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath45 only . the classical spacetime is stationary and invariant under rotations about the @xmath46-axis ; we require that the corresponding killing vectors @xcite @xmath47 are killing vectors of the improved metric , too .",
    "if @xmath48 is annihilated by @xmath49 and @xmath50 this is indeed the case . in the boyer - lindquist ( bl ) system",
    "this means that @xmath51 .",
    "when an explicit form of the `` rg trajectory '' @xmath52 is needed we shall use the relationship ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "however , for our mostly qualitative discussion the precise details of this function are not important .",
    "what matters is only that it smoothly interpolates between @xmath53 in the infrared @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the ultraviolet @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , we assume , as in the previous analyses @xcite that @xmath57 , which is given by the integral ( [ 1.1b ] ) . in the case at hand",
    "it reads @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a path associated to the point @xmath7 with bl coordinates @xmath60 . by stationarity and axial symmetry ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath61 must not depend on @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the line element @xmath18 in ( [ 2.3 ] ) is the one of the classical kerr metric .",
    "the choice for @xmath16 which appears most natural is a radial path from the origin to @xmath7 . along this path , @xmath64 and , by ( [ 1.4 ] ) , @xmath65 .",
    "hence we have in this case @xmath66 this integral is easy to perform only in the equatorial plane , i.e. for @xmath67 .",
    "one obtains @xmath68 where @xmath69 are the radii of the classical horizons given in ( [ 1.8 ] ) , and @xcite @xmath70    ( -1.2,2)(4.2,7.5 )   ( -11.6,5.6)@xmath71 ( -10.25,8.6)@xmath72 ( -8.25,8.6)@xmath73 ( -6.85,7.6)@xmath74 ( -7.2,7.2 ) ( -6.95,6.9 ) ( -8.18,3.1)(-8.18,3.5 ) ( -4.6,3.1)(-4.6,6 ) ( -8.18,2.8)@xmath75 ( -4.6,2.8)@xmath76 ( -4.75,6.6)@xmath77 ( -4.45,5.6)@xmath78 ( -2,5.6)@xmath79 ( -3.3,4.1)@xmath80 ( -5.5,1.9)@xmath9 ( -12.5,0.8)fig .",

    "as @xmath88 by definition , the geometric mass @xmath89 equals the actual mass @xmath31 when planck units are used . )",
    "the main features of the @xmath82 curves are as follows . for @xmath90 not too close to the extreme case @xmath91 , the curves run essentially parallel to the dashed line in fig .",

    "they run parallel to @xmath92 .",
    "in particular for @xmath95 the exact @xmath82 is approximately of the form @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a constant independent of @xmath9 . obviously , for @xmath9 large enough so that @xmath98 , we can approximate the @xmath82 curves simply by @xmath92 . for smaller @xmath9",
    "there is the step - like behavior near @xmath93 and @xmath94 , but in most of our qualitative investigations it will not play a role .",
    "the deviations from @xmath92 become significant when @xmath81 approaches @xmath89 which corresponds to the situation of an extremal classical black hole .",
    "for @xmath99 it is easy to evaluate the integral ( [ 2.4 ] ) numerically .",
    "it turns out that @xmath100 has a similar @xmath9-dependence for all values of @xmath45 . for @xmath101",
    "the shift @xmath97 is somewhat larger than at the equator , but nevertheless all curves are essentially parallel to @xmath92 again .",
    "a more precise asymptotic analysis of the integral ( [ 2.4 ] ) reveals that @xmath100 has the following structure for @xmath102 : @xmath103 there are three types of terms which do not vanish for @xmath104 : a linearly increasing one , a logarithmically increasing one , and one which is @xmath9-independent . among the three ,",
    "only the @xmath9-independent one depends on the angle @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath105 is subdominant we see that , to logarithmic accuracy , @xmath100 is actually independent of @xmath45 at large @xmath9",
    ".    an alternative definition of the distance scale @xmath100 could be as follows @xcite .",
    "let @xmath59 be a circular path of coordinate radius @xmath9 , contained in the @xmath106const plane and centered about the origin . in this case",
    "we define @xmath100 to be the _ reduced circumference _ of this path , i.e. its proper length divided by @xmath107 . in flat space the reduced circumference would equal @xmath9 ; in the kerr background there are corrections .",
    "a detailed numerical analysis @xcite shows that , for @xmath9 not too small , and @xmath81 not too close to @xmath89 , the resulting distance functions @xmath100 have similar qualitative properties as those fom the radial path .    for concreteness we shall use the distance function",
    "obtained from the radial path whenever a concrete expression is needed .",
    "since our analysis is mostly at a qualitative or `` semi - quantitative '' level we shall be concerned with leading order effects only . for this reason we shall neglect the subdominant @xmath45-dependence of @xmath100 and assume that @xmath108 and , as a result @xmath109 depends on @xmath9 only : @xmath110 the implications of the @xmath45-dependence are presumably too weak to be accesible by our present method",
    "from now on we assume that we are given a @xmath9-dependent newton 's constant , @xmath111",

    "the discussion parallels the classical case to some extent @xcite , but the results collected here will be needed for an analysis of the quantum effects .",

    "thus we are led to conclude that if there exists a modified , i.e. quantum version of black hole thermodynamics which is accesible by rg improvement then the temperature can not be simply proportional to the surface gravity , @xmath575 . while a priori it is perhaps not very surprising that the semi - classical relation @xmath250 is subject to quantum gravity correction this causes a difficulty of principle . within the present approach",

    "we observe that the angular momentum dependent terms in ( [ 8.23 ] ) and ( [ 8.24 ] ) _ decrease _ both the black hole s temperature and entropy as compared to the corresponding schwarzschild quantities .",
    "we also see that the size of the @xmath580-corrections increases with @xmath622 , i.e. these corrections grow as the mass @xmath31 of the black hole becomes smaller during the evaporation process .    in summarizing the most important aspects of the modified black hole thermodynamics discussed in this section we recall that @xmath623 does not agree with the surface gravity @xmath236 here as it is the case in the familiar ( semi- ) classical situation .",
    "we demonstrated that a modified first law can exist only when we give up the relationship @xmath250 .",
    "we also showed that , to order @xmath580 , there is a uniquely determined modification of this relationship which allows for the existence of a state function @xmath553 with the interpretation of an entropy .",
    "in this paper we tried to assess the impact of the leading quantum gravity corrections on the properties of rotating black holes within the framework of quantum einstein gravity ( qeg ) . using the gravitational average action as the basic tool we developed a scale - dependent picture of the spacetime structure .",
    "we exploited that @xmath2 is a family of effective field theories labeled by @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , to each point @xmath7 we associated a coarse - graining scale @xmath624 and then described a neighborhood of @xmath7 by the specific effective action @xmath625 . in principle",
    "there could be several plausible choices of the map @xmath626 .",
    "they lead to different `` pictures '' of the same physical system . using the analogy of a microscope with a variable resolving power @xcite we are using a microscope with a position dependent",
    "resolving power , and clearly the `` picture '' we see depends on how we change the resolving power from point to point . for the black hole",
    "the choice of @xmath627 is made less ambiguous than for a generic spacetime since we would like the `` picture '' , the improved metric , to have the same symmetries as the classical metric .",
    "we chose @xmath627 to be monotonically decreasing in the radial direction , giving the best `` resolution '' to points near the black hole and the worst to those asymptotically far away .",
    "the experience with similar `` rg improvements '' indicates that in this way the improved metric encodes the leading quantum corrections at least at a qualitative level .",
    "the results we obtained can be summarized as follows . in general",
    "the quantum corrections are small for heavy black holes ( @xmath197 ) , but become appreciable for light ones .",
    "heavy quantum black holes have the same number of critical surfaces as the classical ones , namely two static limit surfaces and two horizons .",
    "( for @xmath621 the improvement had led to the formation of a new horizon . ) as one lowers @xmath31 towards the planck mass , the two horizons coalesce and then disappear . at an even smaller mass",
    "the static limit surfaces coalesce and then disappear as well .    even though the reliability of the improvement method becomes questionable when the corrected metric is very different from the classical one we believe that the disappearence of the horizons below a certain critical mass is a fairly reliable prediction .",
    "in fact , this phenomenon has a very simple interpretation : the existence of a horizon means that the gravitational field is so strong that it can trap light ; if , however , the strength of the gravitational interaction is reduced at small distances by the rg running of @xmath44 then it is quite plausible that very small objects with a low mass can not prevent light from scaping .",
    "whether or not these objects have a naked singularity remains an open question .",
    "the method used here is likely to loose its validity close to the black hole s center . also on the basis of earlier investigations @xcite ,",
    "it is likely though that the quantum corrections soften the singularity ( again because @xmath44 is `` switched off '' at short distances ) ; it is even conceivable that it disappears altogether @xcite .",
    "a particularly intriguing feature of the kerr black hole is the possibility of energy extraction . as the penrose process is related to the existence of negative energy states of test particles we analyzed the `` phase space '' of such negative energy states in detail . in paticular",
    "we saw that , while it is possible to extract energy from classical black holes of arbitrary small mass and angular momentum , in the improved kerr spacetime there exists a minimum mass for energy extraction .",
    "it is defined by the extremal configuration of the static limit surfaces .",
    "we explained that even though the quantum black holes in the vacuum can be reinterpreted as classical black holes in presence of a special kind of matter mimicking the quantum fluctuations , many of their mechanical and in particular thermodynamical properties are nevertheless nonstandard since this `` pseudo matter '' does not satisfy any of the familiar energy conditions .",
    "as a first step towards an `` rg improved black hole thermodynamics '' we analyzed the problem of identifying a state function which could possibly be interpreted as an entropy .",
    "we saw that in the quantum case the 1-form @xmath628 is no longer exact or , stated differently , the surface gravity is not an integrating factor of @xmath629 .",
    "we concluded that if an entropy is to exist also for the improved black hole , their temperature can not simply be proportional to @xmath236 .",
    "we also saw that for small angular momentum , to order @xmath580 , there exist unambiguously defined modified relationships for the @xmath31- and @xmath40-dependence of temperature and entropy .",
    "we hope to come back to a more detailed discussion of these thermodynamical issues elsewhere .",
