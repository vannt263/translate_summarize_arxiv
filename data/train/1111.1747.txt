    "it has long been recognised that the extended , diffuse stellar haloes of galaxies contain a potential treasure trove of information about the formation and evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , we are entering a ` golden age ' for studies of stellar haloes , with the exploitation of large surveys such as the sdss / sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue , @xcite ) , rave , skymapper , pan - starrs and gaia that are yielding ( or will yield ) exquisite structural and kinematic measurements of the milky way s stellar halo and its substructures .",
    "at the same time , dedicated surveys of nearby galaxies , such as m31 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , ngc 891 @xcite and other nearby galaxies ( e.g. , in the ghosts survey ) , provide us with a valuable external perspective and a point of comparison for the milky way ( i.e. , how typical is the milky way ? ) .    over the past few years",
    "there have also been significant advances in the modelling of stellar haloes of galaxies with masses similar to that of the milky way .",
    "the majority of these studies have relied on so - called ` hybrid ' models , which couple simple recipes for assigning stellar mass to infalling satellites in dissipationless ( i.e. , dark matter only ) cosmological simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in terms of assigning stellar mass to the infalling satellites ,",
    "the models are generally tuned to reproduce the observed luminosity function of satellites around the milky way .",
    "the stellar mass is distributed by tagging centrally - located dark matter particles and tracking the dm particles using their ids . in general , the models have been largely successful at reproducing the observed outer stellar halo , as well as the observed demographics of stellar streams .    however , it has also become clear that such hybrid models have a number of problems .",
    "for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have all shown that they fail to produce significant metallicity gradients in the stellar spheroids , whereas observations of the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite , but see @xcite ) and m31 ( @xcite ) show evidence for large - scale gradients kpc or so , however , the metal - poor component is dominant and there is no further alteration of the mdf as one progresses further into the outer halo ( i.e. , no gradient ) .",
    "the transition from metal - rich component dominance to metal - poor component dominance would suggest a gradient if these populations are not separated explicitly ( e.g. , as in the case of observations of m31 ) , because of the lessening degree of dominance between the metal - rich component , relative to the metal - poor component , as one moves outward .",
    "it is in this sense that we use the term gradient .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the simulated galaxies in gimic  exhibit exactly this behavior ; i.e. , that there are two populations ( in situ and accreted ) with different characteristic metallicities that overlap spatially , and it is the change in the mass fraction of these populations with radius that gives rise to an overall gradient out to radii of 30 kpc ( see their fig .",
    "8) . beyond this radius ,",
    "the accreted component dominates by mass , thus there is no further decline in the mean metallicity . ] .",
    "furthermore , observations of the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) and m31 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as stacked observations of distant galaxies @xcite , show that the spheroid has a highly flattened ( oblate ) distribution , whereas the stellar haloes in hybrid simulations usually have a _ prolate _ configuration like the dark matter @xcite",
    ". observations of the spheroid in the solar neighbourhood show kinematic and chemodynamic evidence for two distinct components to the spheroid ( the ` dual halo ' e.g. , @xcite ) that may be difficult to reconcile with purely dissipationless hybrid methods . finally , hybrid models appear to overproduce the degree of substructure seen in the stellar halo of the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hybrid models implicitly assume that the spheroid is built entirely of the tidal disruption of infalling satellites , they do not include / allow for dissipational processes such as in situ star formation ( i.e. , star formation in the spheroid itself , or star formation in a disc which is subsequently heated to become a spheroid ) . studies of the formation of stellar haloes in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , however , routinely show that this channel for producing stellar spheroids is significant ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter paper i ) . an important caveat to bear in mind ,",
    "is that many cosmological simulations suffer from a large degree of overcooling , and the importance of the in situ component could thus be overestimated in such simulations . however , as we showed in paper i and in @xcite ( hereafter c10 ) , the gimic  suite of cosmological simulations @xcite does not suffer from a large degree of overcooling on the scale of milky way mass ( and lower ) systems , due to efficient ( but energetically - feasible ) supernova ( sn ) feedback .",
    "note that strong sn feedback is widely believed to be required to explain the generally low star formation efficiency ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the ` missing baryon problem ' ( e.g. , @xcite ; c10 ) of normal galaxies , as well as the enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as we demonstrated in paper i , the gimic  simulations yield satellite luminosity functions and stellar spheroid surface brightness distributions that are quite comparable to those observed for the milky way and m31 , which is a direct result of efficient sn feedback .",
    "we also demonstrated in paper i that the gimic  simulations successfully reproduce the radial distribution of metals ( i.e. , the large - scale gradient ) in the spheroid , a problem that has been a thorn in the side of hybrid methods for some time .",
    "this begs the question of whether or not a significant in situ component can also alleviate the problems that hybrid methods have in reproducing the shape of the spheroid , the evidence for a ` dual halo ' from kinematics , and also the degree of substructure .    in the present study ,",
    "we focus on the global structure and kinematics of spheroids and leave the study of substructure for a future work . in particular , in the present study we first examine in some detail the nature of the in situ component in the gimic  simulations and show that its origins are deeply rooted in the dynamical heating of the proto - disc at high redshift .",
    "the implication of this finding is that the in situ component of the spheroid is expected to have different kinematic characteristics ( namely rotation and perhaps also a different velocity anisotropy profile ) than that of the spheroid component built from the disruption of satellites .",
    "in addition , one expects a more flattened distribution for this in situ component , due to its net rotation .",
    "we make comparisons with measurements of the shape and kinematics of the milky way , m31 , and more distant galaxies .",
    "the upshot of this comparison is that the simulated disc galaxies have spheroids of the correct shape ( oblate with a median axis ratio of @xmath3 at @xmath0 kpc ) and that the kinematics show evidence for two components ( due to in situ vs.  accreted ) , as observed .",
    "the present paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : sims ] we describe the simulations and the selection of the sample of milky way - mass disc galaxies . in section 3",
    "we examine the origin of the in situ component of the spheroid in the simulations . in section 4",
    "we present our main results on the global structure and kinematics of the spheroids of the simulated galaxy population and make comparisons with observations .",
    "finally , in section 5 we summarise and discuss our findings .",
    "we use the galaxies - intergalactic medium interaction calculation ( gimic ) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations , which were carried out by the virgo consortium and are described in detail by @xcite , hereafter c09 ( see also c10 and paper i ) .",
    "we present only a very brief summary of the simulations here and refer the interested reader to the above papers for further details .",
    "the suite consists of a set of hydrodynamical re - simulations of five nearly spherical regions ( @xmath4 mpc in radius ) extracted from the millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "the regions were picked to have overdensities at @xmath5 of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the root - mean - square deviation from the mean on this spatial scale .",
    "the 5 spheres are therefore environmentally diverse in terms of the large - scale structure that is present within them . for the purposes of the present study , however , we will only select systems with total ` main halo ' ( i.e. , the dominant subhalo in a friends - of - friends , hereafter fof , group ) masses similar to that of the milky way , irrespective of which gimic  volume it is in ( i.e. , irrespective of the large - scale environment ) .",
    "c09 found that the properties of systems of fixed main halo mass do not depend significantly on the large - scale environment ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "8 of that study ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted for gimic  are the same as those assumed in the millennium simulation and correspond to a @xmath8cdm model with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the rms amplitude of linearly evolved mass fluctuations on a scale of @xmath14 mpc at @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum ) .",
    "the value of @xmath21 is approximately 2-sigma higher than has been inferred from the most recent cmb data @xcite , which will affect the abundance of milky way - mass systems somewhat , but should not significantly affect their individual properties .",
    "the simulations were evolved from @xmath22 to @xmath15 using the treepm - sph code gadget-3   ( last described in @xcite ) , which has been modified to incorporate new baryonic physics .",
    "radiative cooling rates for the gas are computed on an element - by - element basis by interpolating within pre - computed tables generated with cloudy @xcite that contain cooling rates as a function of density , temperature , and redshift and that account for the presence of the cosmic microwave background and photoionisation from a @xcite ionising uv / x - ray background ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this background is switched on at @xmath23 in the simulation , where it quickly ` reionises ' the entire simulation volume .",
    "star formation is tracked in the simulations following the prescription of @xcite which reproduces the observed kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite by construction .",
    "the timed release of individual elements by both massive ( type ii sne and stellar winds ) and intermediate mass stars ( type ia sne and asymptotic giant branch stars ) is included following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "a set of 11 individual elements are followed in these simulations ( h , he , c , ca , n , o , ne , mg , s , si , fe ) , which represent all the important species for computing radiative cooling rates .    feedback from sne is incorporated using the kinetic wind model of @xcite with the initial wind velocity , @xmath24 , set to @xmath25 km / s and the mass - loading parameter ( i.e. , the ratio of the mass of gas given a velocity kick to that turned into newly formed star particles ) , @xmath26 , set to @xmath27 .",
    "this corresponds to using approximately 80% of the total energy available from sne for a @xcite imf , which is assumed in the simulation .",
    "this choice of parameters yields a good match to the peak of the star formation rate history of the universe ( c09 ; see also @xcite ) and reproduces a number of x - ray / optical scaling relations for normal disc galaxies ( c10 ) .",
    "as shown in paper i , the gimic  simulations also produce realistic spheroidal components around @xmath28 disc galaxies ( see figs .  3 - 5 of that paper , which compare the predicted surface brightness and metallicity profiles to observations ) .",
    "to test for numerical convergence , the gimic  simulations have been run at three levels of numerical resolution : ` low ' , ` intermediate ' , and ` high ' .",
    "the low - resolution simulations have the same mass resolution as the millennium simulation ( which , however , contains only dark matter ) while the intermediate- and high - resolution simulations have @xmath29 and @xmath30 times better mass resolution , respectively . only the @xmath31 volume was run to @xmath15 at high resolution , owing to the computational expense of running such large volumes at this resolution . as in paper",
    "i , we adopt the intermediate - resolution simulations in the main analysis and reserve the high - resolution @xmath31 simulation to test the numerical convergence of our results .",
    "the intermediate - resolution runs have a dark matter particle mass @xmath32 m@xmath33 and an initial gas particle mass of @xmath34 m@xmath33 , implying that it is possible to resolve satellites with total stellar masses similar to those of the classical dwarf galaxies around the milky way ( with @xmath35 ) with several hundred up to @xmath36 particles .",
    "the gravitational softening of the intermediate - resolution runs is @xmath37 kpc .",
    "as we showed in the appendix of paper i , the surface brightness and metallicity profiles are converged at this resolution , as is the satellite luminosity function for satellites brighter than @xmath38 ( note that bright satellites dominate the assembly of the accreted component of the stellar spheroid ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the appendix of the present paper",
    ", we show the global shape and kinematics of the spheroid in the intermediate - resolution runs agrees well with that of the high - resolution run .    note that for all these simulations the remainder of the ( @xmath39 mpc)@xmath40 millennium volume is also simulated , but with dark matter only and at much lower resolution .",
    "this ensures that the influence of the surrounding large - scale structure is accurately accounted for .",
    "we use the same sample of 412 milky way - mass disc galaxies introduced in paper i. a milky way - mass system is a defined as a system with a present - day total ( gas+stars+dark matter ) mass within @xmath41 ( i.e. , the radius which encloses a mean density of 200 times the critical density of the universe ) of @xmath42 .",
    "this range roughly spans the mass estimates in the literature for both the milky way and m31 , although we are not attempting to reproduce the properties of either of these systems in detail . systems and their substructures are identified in the simulations using the subfind  algorithm of @xcite , that extends the standard implementation of @xcite by including baryonic particles in the identification of self - bound substructures . for each fof system that is identified , a spherical overdensity ( so ) mass with @xmath43",
    "is computed ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) . the gas+stars+dark matter associated with the most massive subhalo of a fof system",
    "are considered to belong to the galaxy , while the gas+stars+dark matter associated with the other self - gravitating substructures are classified as belonging to satellite galaxies .",
    "as the current study is focused on examining the extended stellar distributions of normal disc galaxies , we exclude all bound substructures ( i.e. , satellites ) from the analyses presented in this paper .",
    "we also exclude mass that is part of the fof system but which is not bound to it ( the so - called fof `` fuzz '' ) , but note that these particles make a negligible contribution to the stellar spheroid by mass .",
    "galaxies identified in this way are then classified morphologically as disc- or spheroid - dominated , based on their dynamics . in particular , we use the ratio of disc stellar mass to total stellar mass ( d / t ) within 20 kpc computed by c10 to select our sample . in particular , we select disc galaxies with @xmath45 . we note that c10 decomposed the spheroid component from the disc by first computing the angular momentum vector of all the stars within 20 kpc , calculating the mass of stars that are counter - rotating , and doubling it .",
    "this procedure therefore assumes that the spheroid has no net angular momentum .",
    "the remaining mass of stars is assigned to the disc and d / t is computed as the disc mass divided by the sum of the disc and spheroid masses . in reality , however , the spheroid of the simulated galaxies ( and likely of real galaxies as well ) does in general possess a net angular momentum .",
    "we explicitly show this below for the simulated galaxies .",
    "however , ignoring this fact in the _ selection _ of our sample has no important consequences for our results or conclusions , since the vast majority of our simulated galaxies are highly disc - dominated regardless of whether or not we take into account the angular momentum of the spheroid when calculating d / t .",
    "the method of c10 for decomposing the disc and spheroid does not assign individual star particles to either component , it simply computes the _ total _ mass in two components .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite in assigning particles to the disc and spheroid . in particular , we align the total angular momentum of the stellar disc with the z - axis , calculate the angular momentum of each star particle in the x - y plane , @xmath46 , and compare it with the angular momentum , @xmath47 , of a star particle on a co - rotating circular orbit with the same energy .",
    "disc particles are then selected using a cut of @xmath48 as in @xcite . visually , this cut is quite successful in isolating the disc , but in a number of cases we found that particles well above / below the disc mid - plane were also assigned to the disc .",
    "for this reason , we also apply a spatial cut such that disc particles can not exist more than @xmath49 kpc above or below the disc mid - plane ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : disc_stack ] below we show that star - forming gas in the disc is generally confined to this region ) .",
    "we have also tried assigning disc particles based on the fraction of stellar kinetic energy in ordered rotation , as defined in @xcite ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : krot_track ] below ) , but found no significant differences from the method outlined above .    finally , we point out that we have not imposed any explicit constraints on the merger histories of the simulated galaxies .",
    "this is in contrast with many of the previous cosmological modelling studies of milky way - type galaxies , which usually select their simulation candidates from systems that have not undergone any major mergers in the recent past ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as noted in paper i , the constraints adopted in previous hybrid studies are overly conservative , given that the majority of the milky way - mass systems in gimic  are disc - dominated systems ( see c10 ) .",
    "the resilience of galactic discs to mergers likely stems from the fact that the galaxies contain a significant dissipational gaseous component , which is able to maintain ( or re - establish ) the disc ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in any case , for the present study , which is based on hydrodynamic simulations of large volumes , there is no need to place explicit constraints on the merger histories since it is easy to identify which galaxies have prominent discs at @xmath15 .    applying the system mass and morphology criteria described above yields a total sample of 412 systems in the 5 intermediate - resolution gimic  volumes .",
    "we define in situ star formation as star formation that takes place in the most massive subhalo of the most massive progenitor ( mmp ) fof group of the present - day system .",
    "stars are said to be ` accreted ' if they formed either in another fof group or in a satellite galaxy ( i.e. , not the dominant subhalo ) of the mmp . in practice , only a small proportion ( 2% ) of the stellar halo is from stars that formed in satellites of the mmp and were then stripped ; most of the accreted stars were formed in other fof groups ( i.e. , other haloes ) before they became satellites of the mmp .        to identify the mmp of a given milky way - mass system at @xmath15 , we first select all dark matter particles within @xmath41 belonging to the dominant subhalo .",
    "we then use the unique ids assigned to these particles to identify the fof group in previous snapshots that contains the largest number of these particles .",
    "this earlier fof group is defined to be the mmp and the dominant subhalo of that fof group is assumed to be the most massive progenitor of the dominant subhalo of the system at @xmath15 .",
    "each of the star particles that comprise the @xmath15 stellar spheroid is tracked back in time to the fof group and subhalo it belonged to , if any , when it formed from a gas particle .",
    "if , at the time of star formation , the star particle is a member of the dominant subhalo of the mmp , the star particle is said to have formed in situ . if it formed in another fof group or in a non - dominant subhalo of the mmp , then it is said to have been accreted .",
    "as discussed in paper i , there are sufficient snapshots output for each of the gimic  volumes to be able to reliably assign particles to a formation mode .",
    "we trace each of the @xmath15 stellar halo particles back in time as far as @xmath50 to determine whether they formed in situ or were accreted .",
    "before examining the shape and kinematics of the stellar spheroid , we begin by examining in some detail the origin of the in situ component , which dominates the spheroid by mass in our simulations .",
    "we show below that there is a close physical connection between the in situ component of the spheroid and the early disc .",
    "this motivates us to look at potential differences in the shape and kinematics of the in situ and accreted components of the spheroid in section 4 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : disc_stack ] we show the stacked ( using all 412 disc galaxies ) spatial distribution of cold , dense star forming gas ( @xmath51 k and @xmath52 @xmath53 ) at various redshifts , @xmath54 .",
    "we only include gas that is part of the most massive subhalo of the most massive progenitor of the disc galaxies that were selected at @xmath15 .",
    "this is , by definition , the gas that gives rise to the in situ stellar component of the galaxy ( both of the disc and the spheroid ) .",
    "the red and blue filled contour enclose 50% and 90% of the star forming gas particles , respectively .    in the top row",
    "we show the stacked distributions where the individual galaxies have been aligned before stacking so that the angular momentum vector of their stars at @xmath15 is parallel to the z - axis . at @xmath15",
    "( top left panel ) a disky distribution is evident .",
    "this implies that the bulk of the star formation is occurring in a disc and that the star forming gas disc is well - aligned with the stellar disc . as we track the most massive progenitor of these galaxies back to previous redshifts and stack using the _ same ( @xmath15 ) rotation matrix _ to align the gas the stacked star forming region becomes less disky and more isotropic in appearance .",
    "either the star forming gas was genuinely distributed in this way ( and therefore discs only formed very recently ) , or the gas was in a disc but the disc has been significantly torqued between @xmath15 and @xmath55 .",
    "we can distinguish between these two possibilities by aligning the star forming gas at @xmath54 using either the angular momentum of the stars ( middle row ) or the angular momentum of the cold gas itself ( bottom row ) at @xmath55 . a disky distribution for the star forming gas is readily apparent using either approach .",
    "the radial extent of the disc becomes smaller at high redshift which is qualitatively consistent with previous simulation studies of disc galaxies as well as with observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the star forming gas becomes more isotropic looking with increasing redshift in the top row because of the significant torquing of the disc . in the legend in the top row",
    "we quote the median misalignment angle ( in deg . ) , @xmath56 , between the angular momentum vector of the star forming gas at @xmath55 and that of the stars at @xmath15 . a random distribution ( i.e.",
    ", no correlation between the vectors ) would have a median misalignment of 90 degrees .",
    "this is nearly the case of the star forming discs at @xmath57 , implying that there is almost no correlation between the orientation of ( proto)-discs at @xmath57 and the descendant discs today .",
    "based on fig .",
    "[ fig : disc_stack ] we therefore conclude that the vast majority of the overall ( disc+spheroid ) in situ component present in our galaxies at @xmath15 formed in a disc at some previous time . since stars formed in situ dominate the stellar spheroid in these simulations out to @xmath58 kpc ( see fig .  7 of paper i )",
    ", this implies that some process has added sufficient energy ( ` puffed up ' ) to the stars to liberate them from the confines of the disc",
    ". we can explicitly check that this is the case by comparing the ratio of ( specific ) kinetic energy in ordered rotation [ @xmath59 , where @xmath60 to total kinetic energy [ @xmath61 , where @xmath62 for in situ stars at the present - day to the same ratio for the same particles at the time of star formation .",
    "operationally , we select cold , star forming ( in situ ) gas particles residing in the most massive progenitor at some previous redshift @xmath54 and then find the corresponding star particles at @xmath15 using the unique particle ids stored in the snapshot data .",
    "note that not all of the cold , star forming gas turns into stars by @xmath15 ( e.g. , some gas is heated up by sne ) and not all of the in situ stars at @xmath15 will be in the cold gas component at @xmath54 .",
    "we are therefore examining a subset of the particles , but it is an unbiased selection in terms of kinematics .",
    "the results of this test are shown in fig .",

    "as shown in paper i , however , the accreted spheroid is still being _ assembled _ today ( see fig .  10 of that study ) .",
    "both the in situ spheroid and disc are on average younger than the accreted spheroid .",
    "interestingly , the median age of the in situ spheroid ( @xmath68 gyr , corresponding to @xmath69 ) is significantly older than the median age of stars in the present - day disc ( @xmath70 gyr , or @xmath71 ) . taken together with figs .  1 - 2",
    ", this implies that the in situ component of the spheroid primarily formed in a _",
    "proto-_disc that evidently was heated up before much of the current disc stellar population was formed .",
    "interestingly , there is a marked decline in the distribution of the in situ spheroid toward younger ages , even though the distribution of ages for the disc is effectively flat below @xmath72 9 - 10 gyr ( implying a nearly constant disc star formation rate for the past @xmath72 9 - 10 gyr ) .",
    "this suggests that the heating mechanism that is responsible for producing the in situ spheroid is becoming less and less efficient at late times .",
    "a likely culprit for the heating is the accretion of satellites ( and mass in general ) onto the simulated galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the mass accretion histories of thousands of milky way - mass dark matter haloes in the millennium - ii simulation . if one defines the epoch of formation as the time when the halo has accreted half of its present - day mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xcite find a median epoch of formation of @xmath73 for milky way - mass haloes",
    "this is suggestively close to the median age of the in situ spheroid component .",
    "alternatively , instead of using the epoch of formation , one can use the redshift of most massive merger .",

    "the accreted spheroid formed mostly from cold gas ( `` cold mode '' ) , whereas approximately half of the stars in the disc and half in the in situ spheroid formed from gas that was accreted in the so - called `` hot mode '' ( i.e. , they formed from the cooling of gas that was first shock heated to approximately the virial temperature ) . ]",
    "our analysis therefore favours a scenario similar to that proposed recently by @xcite , in which the inner parts of galactic spheroids contain proto - disc stars that may have been liberated in the same merger / accretion events that delivered material to the outer spheroid .",

    "the distributions for the disc and in situ spheroid components are quite similar , with a peak peak corresponds to the temperature floor imposed by the photoionising uv / x - ray background in the simulations .",
    "note that the temperature floor that is established depends on redshift , as the cooling rate of the gas increases with redshift due to the increase in density with redshift .",

    ", we find that approximately half of the disc stellar mass formed via the cooling of hot gas .",
    "we find a similar result for the in situ spheroid component .",
    "by contrast , the accreted component formed predominantly from gas that has never been hot .",
    "the above points to a different physical nature for the in situ component than advocated previously by @xcite .",
    "in particular , these authors found a median redshift of formation of @xmath83 for the in situ spheroid component in their simulations .",
    "furthermore , the stars formed at very small radii ( @xmath84 kpc ) from gas that was fed via cold mode accretion . in contrast",
    ", we find the in situ component is younger , formed in a proto - disc , and that approximately half of the stellar mass was formed via the cooling of gas that was heated to approximately the virial temperature of the system .",
    "a possible reason behind this difference is that the simulations adopted by @xcite suffered from a larger degree of overcooling due to inefficient feedback .",
    "a likely consequence of this overcooling is that a significant fraction of the gas that would have been destined to end up as part of the in situ stellar halo was instead converted into stars in small dwarf galaxies at high redshift , and were therefore instead incorporated into the accreted spheroid component when these systems fell into the main progenitor .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the fact that the simulations used by @xcite produce present - day satellite galaxies that are too bright compared to those of the milky way or m31 ( see fig .  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "we note , however , that there are many other differences between the simulations that could also play a role ( e.g. , somewhat different implementations of star formation , chemodynamics , and metal - dependent radiative cooling ) .",
    "direct comparisons of the properties of stellar spheroids predicted by different simulation codes all using the same initial conditions would obviously be beneficial in helping to firmly identify the origin of the apparent differences between the simulations .",
    "the above results point to a close physical connection between the disc and the in situ spheroid in our simulations .",
    "naively , we therefore expect that the latter should have kinematics and a spatial configuration that may be more reminiscent of the former than to the accreted spheroid . as we highlighted in section 1",

    "therefore , there is some preference for satellites to be accreted parallel to the plane of the disc , which could induce a net rotation of the accreted spheroid in the same sense as the disc .",
    "another contributing factor may be the fact that galaxies on prograde orbits are preferentially susceptible to orbital decay due to dynamical friction ( as argued by , e.g. , @xcite ) , although this is only expected to be important for those satellites which are able to penetrate very close to the disc before being disrupted . but note it has even been argued that this effect can give rise to a small net retrograde motion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the other panels we show the distribution of @xmath129 for the spheroid component when we apply cuts in metallicity , age , or galactocentric distance .",

    "there is a strong correlation between the rotation velocity of the spheroid and its mass structure - systems with a high degree of rotation tend to be highly flattened and their mass density tends to drop off more slowly with radius than for systems with a lower degree of rotation .",
    "the correlation between the rotation velocity and flattening is even stronger than the one between the rotation velocity and the power - law index . like the structural parameters",

    "the inverted orange triangle represents the median of the simulated spheroids .",
    "the simulated galaxies have a wide range of behaviours : for some the shape is set entirely by rotation ( @xmath150 ) while for others anisotropy plays as large a role as rotation .",
    "the median corresponds to @xmath151 .",
    "the milky way has @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( see text ) , implying @xmath154 . ]",
    "is there a direct _ causal _ link between the rotation and the shape of the spheroid ?",
    "it is possible , for example , that velocity anisotropy is the true underlying cause of the flattened shape rather than rotation ( as is the case with many giant elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "we attempt to shed some light on this in fig .",
    "[ fig : binney_plot ] , which shows a scatter plot of the average ratio of the rotation velocity to the 3d velocity dispersion of the spheroid against its ellipticity , @xmath155 .",
    "the solid curves correspond to the predictions of the tensor virial theorem applied to oblate spheroids ( see , e.g. , @xcite , see eqn .  4 - 95 of the latter ) with anisotropy parameters @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) = 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5 ( top to bottom ) .",
    "note that the predictions are independent of how rapidly the galaxy rotates and , if the isodensity surfaces are similar concentric ellipsoids , they are also independent of the radial density profile of the spheroid .",
    "it is readily apparent that the spheroids of the simulated galaxies display a fairly wide range of behaviours , from being completely rotation - dominated ( i.e. , points clustered around the top curve ) to having a significant contribution to the flattening from velocity anisotropy with @xmath148 ranging as high as @xmath156 .",
    "the median implied value of @xmath151 for the simulated galaxies .",
    "thus , typically , both rotation and velocity anisotropy contribute to the flattening of the spheroids in our simulations .",
    "measuring the rotation speed of the stellar halo of the milky way is non - trivial as it relies on the availability of accurate distances to the spheroid tracers , an accurate distance from the sun to the centre of the galaxy , and finally an accurate estimate of the local standard of rest circular velocity .",
    "while the sun s galactocentric distance is now relatively well pinned down ( to @xmath133 kpc ) , the other two issues remain .",
    "@xcite have used a large sample of main sequence turn off stars in the sdss to constrain the rotational velocity of both the metal - rich inner and metal - poor outer components ( both confined to @xmath157 kpc ) . under the assumption of the canonical local standard of rest circular velocity of @xmath158 km / s ,",
    "these authors find no evidence for rotation of the inner metal - rich component , but they find evidence for significant net _ retrograde _ motion of the outer metal - poor component of @xmath159 km / s .",
    "we note that there is an ongoing debate about whether or not hard kinematic evidence exists indicating the need for at least two halo components .",
    "@xcite argue that the evidence for two components found by @xcite is spurious , and the result of errors in the distance estimates that were employed in that study . however , as @xcite demonstrate , the stars in the sample considered by @xcite ( whether or not the unlikely main - sequence turn - off luminosity classifications are reassigned to dwarf and/or giant classifications ) clearly exhibit _ proper motion distributions _ that are asymmetric with respect to the other ( non highly retrograde ) stars .",
    "@xcite conclude this illustrates that the inferred asymmetry in the highly retrograde tail arises not from improper distances , but rather , is due primarily to real differences in the proper motions .",
    "@xcite have measured the rotation of the halo using a spectroscopic sample of bhb stars selected from the sdss .",
    "the advantage of bhb stars is that they are luminous and have nearly a constant absolute magnitude when selected within a certain colour range .",
    "the disadvantages are that there are far fewer bhb stars than main sequence turn off stars to work with , and that the bhbs may be a biased tracer of the spheroid ( e.g. , they are typically older on average than main sequence stars ) . in qualitative agreement with @xcite , @xcite find evidence for a retrograde - rotating , relatively metal - poor component with @xmath160 km / s .",
    "but they also find evidence for a prograde - rotating , relatively metal - rich component with @xmath161 km / s .",
    "these values were derived under the assumption of the canonical local standard of rest circular velocity of @xmath158 km / s .",
    "a number of recent studies ( see the discussion in @xcite ) have , however , recommended an upward revision to @xmath162 km / s .",
    "@xcite show that if one adopts a local standard of rest circular velocity of @xmath163 km / s , then the implication is that the metal - poor component has no detectable net rotation while the comparatively metal - rich component has a net prograde rotation velocity of @xmath164 km / s .",
    "this is the speed that is indicated by the solid blue cross in the two panels in the middle row of fig .",
    "[ fig : shape_rot ] , which is compatible with the distribution of simulated galaxies .",
    "is the shape of the milky way s stellar halo determined by rotation or velocity anisotropy ? we can use the theoretical curves plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : binney_plot ] to try to answer this question .",
    "as discussed in section 4.1.2 , the inferred shape of the milky way s halo is @xmath165 , implying an ellipticity of @xmath152 .",
    "using the latest bhb - based results of @xcite provides a measure of the rotation velocity and @xcite have estimated the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of a similar bhb sample ( see their fig .",
    "note that what is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : binney_plot ] is the ratio of the rotation velocity to the _ 3d _ velocity dispersion , which is not directly observable .",
    "thus , one must assume something about the degree of anisotropy in order to infer an anisotropy from fig .",
    "[ fig : binney_plot ] , which is clearly not self - consistent .",
    "however , it can be said with some certainty from the bhb results that @xmath153 for the milky way s stellar halo . using the theoretical curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : binney_plot ] , implies @xmath154 , which is consistent with the implied spread in the spheroids of the simulated galaxies .",
    "thus , based on recent bhb measurements ( which show the halo has a non - zero rotation speed ) , one infers that both rotation and velocity anisotropy contribute to the flattening of the milky way s stellar halo .",
    "we can now return to the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : shape_rot ] , to try to explain the relationship between @xmath109 and @xmath110 in terms of the correlations of these parameters with the rotational speed , @xmath145 .",
    "there is a clear lower envelope to the distribution in the top panel : the minimum @xmath109 increases with @xmath110 ( or , equivalently , the maximum @xmath110 increases with @xmath109 ) .",
    "this same envelope is also visible in the middle left panel : the maximum @xmath110 increases with decreasing @xmath145 and the central panel shows that @xmath109 increases with decreasing @xmath145 .",
    "thus , the maximum @xmath110 must increase with increasing @xmath109 .",
    "however , this kind of correlation argument does not really explain the trend between @xmath109 and @xmath110 or demonstrate causality .",
    "a possible explanation may be found in the @xmath166 plane . in particular , for a given @xmath110 , @xmath145 can not be arbitrarily high . if it is too high , the centripetal force would exceed the gravitational one ( which depends on @xmath110 ) .    finally , in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : shape_rot ] we investigate whether the shape of the stellar mass distribution or its kinematics tell us about the in situ mass fraction .",
    "the green points and error bars represent the median and 1-sigma ( i.e. , encloses 68% of the data ) in the in situ mass fraction in bins of @xmath110 , @xmath109 , and @xmath145 .",
    "as noted above , the in situ mass fraction has been computed within the volume limits specified above .",
    "there is a wide system - to - system variation in the in situ mass fraction , with typical fractions in the range of 20 - 60% ( median of @xmath72 40% ) .",
    "we find no strong trend between the in situ mass fraction and the power - law index , @xmath110 .",
    "a trend exists between the in situ mass fraction and the flattening of the spheroid for @xmath167 or so , in that systems with large in situ mass fractions are typically flatter than those with low in situ mass fractions .",
    "an even stronger trend is evident between the in situ mass fraction and the rotation velocity of the stellar spheroid .",
    "if one uses the simulations as a guide to infer an in situ mass fraction for the milky way , the shape and kinematics would be consistent with a mass fraction of @xmath168 40% .",
    "we have used the gimic  simulations to study the global structure and kinematics of the spheroids of @xmath169 simulated @xmath170 disc galaxies . @xcite",
    "have recently demonstrated that these simulations are able to successfully reproduce the metallicity and surface brightness profiles of the spheroids of the milky way and m31 .",
    "a key to the success of the simulations is a significant contribution to the spheroid from stars that formed _ in situ_. while the outer halo is dominated by accreted stars , stars formed in the main progenitor of the galaxy dominate at @xmath0 kpc .    in the present study",
    "we have shown that there is a close physical connection between the in situ spheroid and the disc , namely that the in situ spheroid was produced by the dynamical heating of a proto - disc .",
    "the likely mechanism for the heating is accretion of satellites ( and mass in general ) at @xmath75 .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached recently by @xcite on the basis of the analysis of idealised simulations of disc bombardment by infalling satellites .",
    "given the very different origins for the in situ and accreted spheroids , we expect there to be differences in the global structure and kinematics of the two components .",
    "indeed , we have shown that the inner regions of the spheroid are highly flattened ( oblate ) and show evidence for two components in the kinematics , with the dominant one rotating in prograde fashion with respect to the disc .",
    "the degree of flattening is in good accordance with detailed observations of both local galaxies , such as the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) and m31 @xcite , and stacked observations of more distant galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the results of collisionless hybrid models in which star particles are ` painted on ' to dark matter haloes of infalling dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which usually give rise to highly _",
    "prolate _ configurations , like that of the underlying dark matter halo @xcite .    as we noted in the introduction",
    ", hybrid models also fail to reproduce the observed radial trend with metallicity found in the milky way and m31 @xcite , and it is difficult to see how they could be easily reconciled with the kinematic and chemodynamic evidence for a ` dual halo ' in the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the gimic  simulations , on the other hand , successfully and simultaneously account for the large - scale metallicity distribution , the flattening of the spheroid , and the presence of two components in the kinematics of the spheroid stars .",
    "including hydrodynamics in the simulations does not in and of itself guarantee success though .",
    "we suggest that the stars that constitute the present - day in situ spheroid must be formed in a proto - disc ( at relatively late times of @xmath171 ) in order for the present - day spheroid to have the correct shape and kinematics .",
    "this likely requires an efficient form of feedback to operate in order to delay the formation of these stars .",
    "this is achieved in the gimic  simulations with efficient , but energetically feasible , supernova feedback . note that strong sn feedback is required in simulations in order to explain the generally low star formation efficiency and the ` missing baryon problem ' of normal galaxies , and to enrich the intergalactic medium via outflows .    as a further test",
    ", it will be interesting to see whether such hydrodynamic simulations can also account for the relatively low fraction of unbound substructure ( relative to that predicted by hybrid models ) that is observed in the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we use the galaxies - intergalactic medium interaction calculation ( gimic ) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the global structure and kinematics of stellar spheroids of milky way mass disc galaxies . </S>",

    "<S> have recently demonstrated that these simulations are able to successfully reproduce the satellite luminosity functions and the metallicity and surface brightness profiles of the spheroids of the milky way and m31 . </S>",
    "<S> a key to the success of the simulations is a significant contribution to the spheroid from stars that formed _ in situ_. while the outer halo is dominated by accreted stars , stars formed in the main progenitor of the galaxy dominate at @xmath0 kpc . in the present study we show that this component was primarily formed in a proto - disc at high redshift and was subsequently liberated from the disc by dynamical heating associated with mass accretion . as a consequence of its origin , </S>",
    "<S> the in situ component of the spheroid has different kinematics ( namely net prograde rotation with respect to the disc ) than that of the spheroid component built from the disruption of satellites . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the in situ component has a flattened distribution , that is due in part to its rotation . </S>",
    "<S> we make comparisons with measurements of the shape and kinematics of local galaxies , including the milky way and m31 , and stacked observations of more distant galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the simulated disc galaxies have spheroids of the correct shape ( oblate with a median axis ratio of @xmath1 at radii of @xmath2 kpc , but note there is significant system - to - system scatter in this quantity ) and that the kinematics show evidence for two components ( due to in situ vs.  accreted ) , as observed . </S>",
    "<S> our findings therefore add considerable weight to the importance of dissipative processes in the formation of stellar haloes and to the notion of a ` dual stellar halo ' .    </S>",
