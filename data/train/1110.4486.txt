    "<S> to understand how charge transport is affected by a background medium and vice versa we study a two - channel transport model which captures this interplay via a novel , effective fermion - boson coupling . by means of ( dynamical ) dmrg we prove that this model exhibits a metal - insulator transition at half - filling , where the metal typifies a repulsive luttinger liquid and the insulator constitutes a charge density wave . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum phase transition point is determined consistently from the calculated photoemission spectra , the scaling of the luttinger liquid exponent , the charge excitation gap , and the entanglement entropy .    </S>",
    "<S> the way a system evolves from a metallic to an insulating state is one of the most fundamental problems in solid state theory . </S>",
    "<S> electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions are the driving forces behind metal - insulator transitions ( mits ) in the majority of cases . for example , the mott - hubbard mit  @xcite is caused by strong coulomb correlations , whereas the peierls mit  @xcite is triggered by the coupling to vibrational excitations of the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically the mit problem can be addressed by the investigation of generic hamiltonians for interacting electrons and phonons such as hubbard or holstein models  @xcite . in one dimension ( 1d ) , </S>",
    "<S> these models exhibit a mit at half - filling , where on the insulating side of the mit a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) or a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) broken - symmetry ground state appears , respectively . on the metallic side , near the mit </S>",
    "<S> , charge transport then takes place within a strongly correlated `` background '' that anticipates the developing sdw , respectively cdw , order . </S>",
    "<S> since the particles responsible for charge transport and the background order phenomena are the same , the problem is very complex .    </S>",
    "<S> a path forward might be the construction of simplified transport models , which capture the basic mechanisms of quantum transport in a background medium in a rather effective way . </S>",
    "<S> along this line a novel quantum transport model has been proposed recently  @xcite , @xmath0 this so - called edwards model mimics the correlations inherent to a spinfull fermionic many - particle systems by a boson affected hopping of spinless particles ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : model ] ) . for the half - filled band case </S>",
    "<S> , the model describes a repulsive tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) , provided the excitations of the background are energetically inexpensive ( @xmath1 ) or will readily relax ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this defines the fluctuation dominated regime . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , strong background correlations , which will develop for large @xmath3 and small @xmath4 tend to immobilize the charge carriers and may even drive a mit by establishing cdw long - range order  @xcite . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we employ density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) and dynamical dmrg methods  @xcite to analyse the ground - state properties of the edwards model and the charge carrier dynamics for the limiting case of high - energy background fluctuations .    ) </S>",
    "<S> describes a very general situation : as a charge carrier ( @xmath5 ) moves along a 1d transport path it creates an excitation with energy @xmath3 ( @xmath6 ) in the background at the site it leaves or annihilates an existing excitation at the site it enters . </S>",
    "<S> the background medium may represent , e.g. , a magnetically , orbitally or charge ordered lattice . </S>",
    "<S> one assumes that the ( de)excitation of the background can be parameterized as a bosonic degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> any distortion of the background can heal by quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly the @xmath7-term allows for spontaneous boson creation and annihilation processes . ]    </S>",
    "<S> let us start with the discussion of the photoemission ( pe ) spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle spectral function probed by angle - resolved [ inverse ] pe reads @xmath8\\ , . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{spsfpm}\\ ] ] here @xmath9 [ @xmath10 is associated with the emission [ injection ] of an electron with wave vector @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 is the ground state of a @xmath15site system in the @xmath16particle sector , while @xmath17 denote the @xmath18-th excited states in the @xmath19-particle sectors with excitation energies @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> for the half - filled edwards model we have @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : spsf ] shows @xmath22 for a stiff background , i.e. the distortions induced by particle hopping are energetically costly . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the bosons will strongly affect particle transport : the quasiparticle mass is sizeably enhanced and a renormalized band structure appears but  if @xmath7 is large enough  the system remains metallic , as can be seen from the finite spectral weight at the fermi energy @xmath23 ( left panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the system s ability for relaxation decreases , i.e. , at fixed @xmath3 , @xmath7 falls below a certain critical value , a gap opens in the single - particle spectrum at @xmath24 ( middle panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> evidently the system has become an insulator . </S>",
    "<S> we note the internal feedback mechanism : the collective boson excitations originate from the motion of the charge carriers and have to persist long enough to finally inhibit particle transport , thereby completely changing the nature of the many - particle ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the collective boson - particle dynamics leads to an asymmetric band structure for @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( see inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> while the induced hole probed by pe can only move coherently by a six - step process with three bosons first excited and afterwards consumed , an additional electron can easily move by a two - step process even if strong cdw correlations exist in the background  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the ( i)pe spectra exhibit weak signals around the bare boson energies @xmath27 ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interrelation of charge dynamics and background fluctuation becomes apparent again , if we decrease @xmath3 keeping @xmath7 fixed ( right panel ) . now </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations overcome the correlations and the system returns to a metallic state which is different in nature , however , from the state we started with : @xmath22 shows sharp absorption features near @xmath28 only and is `` overdamped '' at the brillouin zone boundaries , where the spectrum is dominated by bosonic excitations .    in order to determine more precisely the phase boundary between the metallic and insulating ground states , </S>",
    "<S> typifying a tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) and a cdw , respectively , we analyse the limiting ( @xmath29 ) behaviour of the tll charge exponent @xmath30 as well as those of the single - particle ( charge ) gap , @xmath31 , and monitor the finite - size scaling of the entanglement entropy difference  @xcite @xmath32\\ , , \\label{delta_e_entropy}\\ ] ] where @xmath33=   \\tfrac{c^\\ast}{3}\\ln\\left [ \\tfrac{n}{\\pi}\\sin\\big(\\frac{\\pi l}{n}\\big)\\right]+s_1 $ ] . we expect that the tll charge exponent decreases from @xmath34 , as @xmath7 is lowered , and finally reaches 1/2 at the mit point , if the transition is of kosterlitz - thouless type  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the central charge @xmath35 should scale to unity in the metallic tll regime  @xcite .     in the half - filled band sector of the 1d edwards model . </S>",
    "<S> the insets shows the dispersion of the absorption / emission maximum . for the numerics , we consider an @xmath36site chain with open boundary conditions ( bc ) and map a boson site , containing @xmath37 states , to @xmath38 pseudosites </S>",
    "<S> we take up to 4 pseudosites , keep @xmath39 density - matrix eigenstates , and use a broadening @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> all energies are given in units of @xmath41 . ]     extrapolated value of the tll parameter @xmath42 , respectively of the charge gap @xmath43 , as a function of @xmath44 for @xmath45 ( open bc ) . </S>",

    "<S> our dmrg results point towards an exponential opening of the charge gap entering the insulating state , which corroborates the kosterlitz - thouless transition scenario . </S>",
    "<S> note that the cdw state of the edwards model is a few boson state , in contrast to the peierls cdw phase of the holstein model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that means the mit in the edwards model is driven by strong correlations , as for the mott - hubbard transition . to extract the central charge </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 we use the entanglement entropy difference , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ delta_e_entropy ] ) , rather than directly exploiting @xmath54 . for a model with spinless fermions </S>",
    "<S> this is advantageous because we can work with a fixed system size , thereby avoiding antiperiodic bc that give rise to complex phase factors  @xcite . as can be seen from the middle panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : krhoetal ] , for @xmath55 , the rescaled quantity @xmath56 $ ] extrapolates to unity as @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this opens an alternative route to detect the mit point . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath57 determined by extrapolating the maximum of @xmath46 , i.e. in a completely different manner , matches the critical value obtained from @xmath42 surprisingly well . simultaneously , indeed @xmath58 ( see right panel ) .    to summarise , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the spectral and ground - state properties of the 1d edwards fermion - boson transport model by large - scale ( dynamical ) dmrg numerics . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that strong correlations within the background medium will not only affect the charge - carrier s dynamics by enhancing the quasiparticle mass but may even trigger a metal - insulator quantum phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the mit transition point has been determined in good agreement both from the tll charge exponent and the entanglement entropy difference . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that to date only a very small number of microscopic model exists which have been rigorously shown to exhibit a mit .    </S>",
