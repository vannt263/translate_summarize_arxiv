    "that result was shown to be true for general observables and for a final measurement that can be either weak or strong . here , we give a less rigorous but more intuitive derivation of this result by restricting ourselves to observables that are projectors and to a strong final measurement .",

    "one starts with an ensemble of quantum systems all in an identical initial state @xmath122 . for each member of the ensemble ,",

    ", the concept of a photon s wavefunction has been clarified .",
    "the photon s full quantum state describes its freqency - time , position - momentum , and polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "the quantum state formalism has been successfully used in hundreds , if not thousands , of papers to theoretical describe the physics of single and entangled photons in experiments ,",
    "so one might ask why there is any controversy .",
    "confusion about this concept largely arose because the concept of the wavefunction was introduced in terms of the non - relativistic schrdinger equation , yet 1 .",
    "the schrdinger equation contains a mass parameter , whereas the photon is massless , 2 .",
    "the position operator in schrdinger equation is not a true observable for photons ; they are naturally relativistic and can not be localized to an exact position @xcite .",
    "compounding this confusion is the fact that dirac derived the second quantization ( i.e. quantum electrodynamics ) for the electromagnetic field .",
    "in short , the answer to this confusion is that maxwell s equations play the same role to the photon as the schrdinger equation does to , say , an electron @xcite .",
    "is the first quantization of the electromagnetic field , the wavefunction of the photon .",
    "in fact , maxwell s equations can be combined into a single equation that has the same analytic form as the schrdinger equation .",
    "this resolves issue number 1 ; the schrdinger equation is not valid for a photon , but there is an equation that the _ same _ form as the schrdinger equation that _ is _ valid .",
    "the resolution to issue number 2 comes in two limits . in the limit of relativistic massive particles on",
    "should use the relativistic schrdinger equation , in which the standard position observable is not valid @xcite .",
    "that is , both photons and electrons do not have simple position observable in the relativistic limit .",
    "in fact , there is an inherent contradiction in the non - relativistic schrdinger equation : an electron localized to a point will contain infinite momentum components , and , hence , will be relativistic .    consequently , the position observable in the schrdinger equation is only a valid approximation in certain limits .",
    "the same holds for the photon ; when one is in both the paraxial limit and in the limit where the slowly varying frequency envelope amplitude approximation is valid @xcite , the photon wavefunction can be written as @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the photon s momentum and @xmath142 is the polarization of the photon ( @xmath143=horizontal , @xmath144=vertical ) . in these limits ,",
    "@xmath145 and @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the photon s frequency and @xmath148 is photon s time ( @xmath81 is heisenberg s constant and @xmath125 is the speed of light ) .",
    "these parameters are all defined relative to some time - space coordinate system . in these limits ,",
    "transverse positions @xmath0 and @xmath93 ; transverse momenta @xmath149 and @xmath150 ; frequency @xmath147 ( or @xmath151 ) ; and time @xmath148 ( or @xmath152 ) can each be measured as an observable .",
    "moreover , in these limits , the photon wavefunction is normalized to unity in the same manner as the electron wavefunction : @xmath153 these normalizations show some of the many equivalent ways of expressing the photon wavefunction .",
    "the relation to the second quantization of light is that the wavefunction of the photon becomes a ` mode ' in which photons can be created such that , @xmath154 where @xmath155 is a photon creation operator for the plane wave defined by @xmath149 , @xmath156 @xmath147 , and @xmath157 . in this context ,",
    "the single photon wavefunction is same state as@xmath158 .    in our experiment",
    ", we focus on the transverse position @xmath0 wavefunction @xmath58 of the photon .",
    "this is valid if the full wavefunction can be factorized , @xmath159 , which we ensure by using photons of a single frequency , polarization and spatial mode ( the fiber mode ) . since photons",
    "do not interact , it is not crucial to send them through one at a time .",
    "this is true as long as the only measurements are of the number operator @xmath160 i.e. intensity measurements .",
    "hence , for experimental simplicity we use an attenuated laser as our source of photons .      here , we use back - action as a term to describe the disturbance induced in the measured system by a measurement .",
    "our theoretical discussion of weak measurement described results in the limit of zero interaction between the measurement apparatus ( the photon polarization and waveplate sliver ) and the system ( the photon s transverse position ) . while this limit is unphysical , generally , the average result of a weak measurement ( the ` weak value ' or ` weak average ' ) converges to its limit - value asymptotically as the interaction strength is reduced .",
    "consequently , the weak average is a good approximation even for reasonable interaction strengths . in our measurement",
    ", we use both a two - dimensional operator @xmath49and pointer ( i.e. polarization ) .",
    "this bounds the effect of backaction and makes it simple to account for @xcite .",
    "consider the unitary that models our weak measurement of position , @xmath161 where @xmath71 is the pauli operator and @xmath65 is the strength of the interaction . without any approximations , this induces a rotation of the polarization by @xmath65 if the photon is at position @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath65 increases , it will entangle the polarization and position degrees of freedom .",
    "this entanglement is the cause of a dephasing in the @xmath0-basis , i.e. the back - action . in turn",
    ", this dephasing suppresses the dirac distribution by an amount proportional to @xmath162 , @xmath163 .",
    "this effect creates a small offsets in every point of the dirac distribution that are difficult to see .",
    "hence , we do not correct our dirac distributions for the back - action . on the other hand , if we examine the @xmath0-basis density matrix found from the measured dirac distribution , we find that the back - action suppresses only the diagonal elements .",
    "we correct our presented density matrices by dividing the diagonals by @xmath164 ) .",
    "note that since this correction grows as @xmath165 for small @xmath65 , one can measure a good approximation to the true weak average even for experimentally reasonable values of@xmath65 .",
    "as one reduces @xmath65 , at some point another source of experimental error or uncertainty will become dominant . in practice",
    ", there is no need to be in the limit @xmath101 .",
    "the dirac distribution shares many of the properties of other the other common quasi - probability distributions - the q , p and wigner functions .",
    "namely , any physically measurable property can be calculated directly and simply from the dirac distribution without first transforming to the density matrix @xcite .",
    "it can be used to directly calculate the average result of measuring an observable @xmath166 on state @xmath19 : @xmath167=2\\pi\\iint dxdp\\mathrm{\\mathbb{\\widetilde{p}}_{\\rho}}(x , p)\\mathrm{\\mathbb{\\widetilde{p}}_{a}^{*}}(x , p),\\ ] ] where @xmath168 is the dirac distribution for observable @xmath169 and * is the complex conjugate .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "4 in the main paper shows that once the strength of the measurement ( i.e.@xmath172 ) is accounted for , the measured dirac distribution requires no further normalization ( unlike the direct wavefunction measurement in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .        consequently , the result of our joint weak measurement , the dirac distribution of the density operator , is a capable alternative to the standard quantum quasi - probability distributions , such as thefunction .",
    "its peculiarity is that it is complex whereasprobabilities are real .",
    "nonetheless , our method for directly measuring it provides an operational meaning to both its real and imaginary parts ; they appear right on our measurement apparatus , in the shifts in the two conjugate observables of the pointer , e.g. , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "where @xmath180 and @xmath181 is a normalization @xcite ( here , we have left out the effect of the magnification lens ) with this , we propagate the experimental dirac distribution in fig .",

    "<S> this is the plane in space at which we measure the dirac distribution of the photon ensemble . here </S>",
    "<S> , a quartz sliver ( width @xmath63 mm ) rotates the photon polarization ( initially @xmath64 ) to @xmath65 degrees at position @xmath0 . for @xmath66 </S>",
    "<S> this would be a strong measurement , whereas by setting @xmath67 our measurement becomes weak . </S>",
    "<S> the sliver is also slightly tilted about the x - axis in order to null any phase shift it induces . as described in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we can readout by measuring @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the polarization state of the photon , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the pauli operators , and @xmath72 is the lowering operator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the real part and imaginary parts of the weak value are proportional to the shift from zero of the average value of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as expected the two parts separately appear in conjugate variables of our measurement apparatus , that is , in the linear and circular polarizations .    in order to perform a _ joint _ measurement of @xmath73 </S>",
    "<S> we must make polarization measurements at each momentum . </S>",
    "<S> to do so , a lens ( achromat , @xmath741 m , @xmath755 cm ) is placed one focal length after the sliver . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform ( ft ) of the quantum state forms in the plane one focal length past the lens . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the transverse position @xmath76 in this ft plane is proportional to the transverse momentum @xmath1 of the photon at the sliver . we magnify ( @xmath77 ) by another lens ( @xmath78 mm , @xmath79 cm ) so that the final scaling is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is planck s constant . to readout @xmath82 we project onto a circular or linear polarization by inserting a quarter - waveplate ( @xmath83 ) and/or polarizer ( pol , nanoparticle linear film polarizer , thorlabs lpvis50 ) just before the magnifying lens </S>",
    "<S> . then , position and momentum are jointly measured by measuring @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> we do so by recording the average number of photons @xmath85 arriving at each transverse position @xmath76 on a camera sensor ( basler aca1300 - 30um , pixel size : 3.75@xmath86@xmath623.75@xmath86 , x@xmath62y array size : 1296@xmath62966 , 12 bit ) for two pairs of polarization measurements : @xmath87 and @xmath88 polarizations , and right ( @xmath89 ) and left - hand ( @xmath90 ) circular polarizations . for @xmath91 the differences in each pair are proportional to the real and imaginary parts of the dirac distribution ,    @xmath92    where the expectation value is now an average over the polarization and transverse momentum state of the photon ensemble . each polarization measurement is a 1.8 s camera exposure in which we average along the @xmath93 dimension to arrive at a vector @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> we take the mean of the weak average over ten scans of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> we directly measure the dirac distribution @xmath36 for the transverse quantum state by measuring these polarization differences for every @xmath1 as a function of the sliver position @xmath0 , which we move in steps of 1 mm across aperture of the collimating lens . </S>",
    "<S> the insets of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 plot this pair of polarization differences as the real and imaginary parts of @xmath36 according to eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : exp_dirac ] . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( a ) and ( b ) display the measured dirac distribution for the case where the glass plate is stationary ( pure state ) and oscillating ( mixed state ) , respectively . as can be seen in the lower plots , </S>",
    "<S> there is a state - independent phase of @xmath94 inherent to the dirac distribution , imposed on the underlying 2-d form of the state in ( a ) and ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this overlay phase structure allows one to immediately see phase jumps , such as the one in the pure state ( a ) at @xmath9525 mm ( the glass edge ) due to increased optical path length through the glass . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , </S>",
    "<S> in the mixed state ( b ) , the phase fringes on either side of @xmath9525 mm are unrelated , a signature of the lack of phase coherence across this point . </S>",
    "<S> looking now at the magnitude , shown in the upper plots , both the mixed and pure states exhibit a depression at @xmath96 mm , likely due to photons being scattered out of the apparatus by the glass edge . in the momentum direction , </S>",
    "<S> the width of the mixed state is broader than the pure state , as is expected due to the reduced spatial coherence of the former . </S>",
    "<S> this is accompanied by a decreased magnitude since the distribution is normalized to one . </S>",
    "<S> these distinctive features suggest that the dirac distribution provides a useful way to visualize key characteristics of pure and mixed quantum states .    </S>",
    "<S> the dirac distribution is related in a simple way to the position density matrix of the state , @xmath97(x')$ ] , where the fourier transform ft is performed with respect to momentum @xmath1 @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , we plot the position density matrix for each of the dirac distributions from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . for the pure state fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( a ) , the hard edges of the aperture form a square outline in @xmath19 and the phase jump now appears at both @xmath9525 mm and @xmath9825 mm . strikingly , in the mixed state in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( b ) the off - diagonal regions for @xmath0@xmath99 mm , @xmath100>25 mm , and the reverse are close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> this is indicative of the lack of coherence between the part of the state that passes through the oscillating glass and the part that does not . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that we can successfully measure the dirac distribution for a transverse quantum state and that it correctly determines the state of a mixed system . </S>",
    "<S> since we are not in the limit of a zero interaction - strength measurement ( @xmath101 ) , there will still be some backaction due to the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> while in the dirac distribution this leads to minor offsets @xmath102 everywhere , in the density matrix it leads solely to a suppression , by @xmath103 , of the diagonals , which we correct for in fig 3 ( see supp . mat . ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the compatibility of bayes theorem with the dirac quasi - probability distribution goes beyond the simple example we gave earlier . </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity of dirac distribution allows us to generalize its theoretical definition to multiple variables , e.g. , @xmath104=@xmath105 $ ] , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are another two continuous variables ( e.g. the photon position and momentum at a later time after undergoing some evolution ) . </S>",
    "<S> hoffman showed that with the above theoretical definition of @xmath108 one can propagate the dirac distribution @xmath109 in time by applying bayes theorem @xcite : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is independent of the quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> this four dimensional generally complex conditional quasi - probability is a propagator of an arbitrary point in @xmath112 phase - space to any point in @xmath113 phase - space . in the context of quantum information , it functions like </S>",
    "<S> a superoperator ( i.e. it transforms between density operators ) and can encompass both unitary and non - unitary evolution of any quantum process ( see @xcite for further development of this concept ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is very different from using bayes theorem to update a prior quantum state based on the incomplete information about the system provided by classical positive - valued statistics , e.g. povms ( as was studied in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , here , as with classical probability distributions , one can directly apply bayes theorem to update the dirac quasi - probability distribution and evolve it as a function of space or time .    </S>",
    "<S> we now describe a demonstration of this bayesian propagation . for the sake of experimental simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we only update one of the variables in the dirac distribution @xmath114 to arrive at @xmath115 . by moving the camera back from the re - imaged fourier </S>",
    "<S> transform plane so that the photons travel a further distance @xmath40 before being detected , we change our strong measurement of @xmath4 to one of @xmath107 , which is a combination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite ( see supp mat . ) . </S>",
    "<S> then we make a joint weak - strong measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath107 in exactly the same manner as we did for the dirac distribution to experimentally measure @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> we repeat the experiment [ fig 4 . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) ] and theoretical [ fig 4 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) ] bayes propagation ( see supp </S>",
    "<S> . mat . ) for three values of @xmath117 and plot the results in fig . 4 ( i - iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath40 is increased , the distributions in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 exhibit a broadening of @xmath116 in the @xmath107 direction . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the broad width of the photon state in @xmath3 and the fact that the @xmath3 portion of the hybrid @xmath118 variable @xmath107 increases as @xmath40 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> also apparent is a growing @xmath119 displacement of the @xmath120 mm portion of the state as @xmath40 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with a wedge in our oscillating glass plate of 0.4 arcseconds . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , each of the three pairs of experimental and theoretical distributions agree well in a qualitative manner , which confirms the applicability of classical - like bayesian propagation .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> by experimentally measuring the dirac quasi - probability distribution we have completely determined a mixed quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> we have also demonstrated that the dirac distribution measured at different spatial planes are related by bayes law , which therefore acts as a propagator of the quasi - probability . </S>",
    "<S> quasi - probability distributions like the q , p , or wigner function reflect the arbitrary choice of the operator ordering ( normal , anti - normal , or symmetric ) that embodies the inherent incompatibility of quantum and classical physics . missing from this list has been the standard ordering , the dirac quasi - probability distribution , which has three outstanding features : 1 . </S>",
    "<S> its measurement is simple and similar to the classical equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is compatible with bayes theorem , with which we can propagate it to other points in space or time . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . in the limit of a pure quantum state </S>",
    "<S> , it reduces to quantum wavefunction itself .    </S>",
    "<S> we thank aephraim steinberg and holger f. hofmann for useful discussions . </S>"
