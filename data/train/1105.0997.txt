    "as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , a grism is a direct - vision dispersive element composing of a transmission grating and prism(s ) .",
    "a grism is designed to cancel the diffraction angle of a transmission grating by the refracting angle of the prism(s ) ; the dispersed beam of the central wavelength of the specific diffraction order goes straight forward in parallel with the incident beam .",
    "this has a great advantage of an astronomical instrument in that we can switch promptly between the imaging mode and the spectroscopic mode , just by setting a slit onto the focal plane of a telescope and inserting a grism into the collimated beam section of the instrument .",
    "faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ) is an optical instrument for the cassegrain focus of the 8.2 m subaru telescope on mauna kea , hawaii ( kashikawa , et al .",
    "focas has been operated as an open common - use instrument since 2001 april . a pair of 4k@xmath02k back - side illuminated ccd imagers of focas with pixels 15 @xmath1 m square cover the entire cassegrain field of view , 6 in diameter , at a pixel scale of 0\".103/pixel .",
    "focas offers several observing modes : direct imaging , long - slit spectroscopy , multi - slit spectroscopy , and slitless spectroscopy .",
    "each of these modes can be used together with polarimetric elements .",
    "as dispersive elements , focas provides five surface relief grisms , including an echelle type grism , and eight volume - phase holographic ( vph ) grisms optimized for various resolving powers ( @xmath2 ) , ranging from 280 to 8200 with various central wavelengths designed so as to cover the entire spectral region .",
    "a direct - vision prism is also installed as a cross disperser for the echelle - type grism .",
    "we describe the specifications and performance of these grisms in section 2 and 3 that are now in use for focas .",
    "examples for astronomical spectroscopic observations are also presented in section 4 .",
    "we present conclusions in section 5 .",
    "because of the limitation of the collimated - beam size of focas and the size specification for housing grisms in the grism turret , the physical size of a focas grism is specified to be 110 mm@xmath0106 mm in aperture with a maximum thickness 110 mm along the optical axis , so as to offer an effective aperture of 102 mm in diameter .",

    "they suggested that the explosion date of the sn agrees with the grb in the range @xmath44 d , based on the similarity in the spectral evolution to the broad - lined sne ic ( `` hypernovae '' ) 1998bw and 1997ef .",
    "kawai et al .",
    "( 2006 ) performed follow - up spectroscopy of grb 050904 ; 3 d after the grb , and confirmed that the spectral cutoff around 900 nm is produced by ly @xmath6 absorptions at @xmath45 ( totani et al .",

    "the early - phase spectrum is characterized by continuum and broad absorption lines such as o i 7773 and ca ii ir triplet ; while the late - phase spectra are dominated by emission lines as [ o i ] 6300 , 6363 , [ ca ii ] 7291 , 7323 , [ o ii ] 7320 , 7330 , and the ca ii .",
    "these spectra are consistent with mildly energetic explosion with oxygen - rich ejecta of @xmath46 m@xmath47 and @xmath48 erg ( see mazzali et al .",
    ", width=453 ]    subaru / focas also enables us to perform spectroscopic monitoring of nearby sne through later , nebular phases ( @xmath49 days after the sn explosion , figure [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "mazzali et al .",
    "( 2005 ) obtained a double - peaked [ o i]emission line for the non - grb - associated hypernova sn 2003jd at @xmath50 yr after the explosion , which suggested that the sn was an aspherical axisymmetric explosion viewed from near the equatorial plane .",
    "this result is interesting because grbs are believed to be produced from a highly asymmetric explosion ; also , some core - collapse sne are aspherical ( and also linked with grbs ) .",
    "maeda et al . ( 2008 ) gathered such late - phase spectra of 15 envelope - stripped , core - collapse sne using focas , and revealed that the high incidence of the double - peaked profiles are consistent with a model where all envelope - stripped , core - collapse sne are aspherical .    about late - phase spectroscopy with focas ,",
    "a number of case studies have been reported for specific sne , such as a peculiar sn ib 2005bf ( tominaga et al .",
    "2005 ; maeda et al .",
    "2007 ) , a faint sn ib 2005cz in an elliptical galaxy ( kawabata et al . 2010 ) , a faint sn ia 2005hk ( sahu et al .",
    "2008 ) , sn ib 2008d associated with an x - ray transient ( tanaka et al .",
    "2009 ) .    for the brightest nearby sne ,",
    "subaru / focas enables us to perform high - quality spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "so far , spectropolarimetric results have been reported , e.g. , for sn ia 2009dc ( tanaka et al .",
    "they all showed solid intrinsic polarization of continuum light and/or in absorption lines , which can be explained by the global asymmetry of the photosphere , or clumpy distribution of some specific elements within the photosphere , e.g. , oxygen , calcium , and silicon .",
    "krause et al . ( 2008a ) used focas to obtain the spectrum of the historical supernova sn 1572 observed by tycho brahe .",
    "the observation was done in 2008 , @xmath5400 yr after direct light of the supernova reached earth .",
    "this was enabled by observing a `` light echo '' , which is light from the original supernova scattered toward us by a surrounding interstellar cloud .",
    "the low grism in the second diffraction order and the middle blue grism were used together with a 2\"-width slit to cover the wavelength range of 380 to 920 nm with a spectral resolution of 2.4 nm ( r=160@xmath5380 ) .",
    "the acquired echo spectrum shows the broad absorption and emission features that are commonly observed in supernovae . a detailed analysis and a comparison of composite spectra with those of the other past supernovae allowed a precise determination of the spectral type , and revealed that sn 1572 belongs to the class of normal type - ia supernovae .",
    "the same observational technique was also used to determine the type of the cassiopeia a supernova in 1680 .",
    "it was found that this supernova was the rare class of type - iib supernovae , and originated from the collapse of a red supergiant ( krause et al .",
    "2008b ) .",
    "vph grisms are being use for observations of the most distant galaxies as mentioned in section 4.1 .",
    "about other examples , the vph450 grism was used for observations of a binary system with a compact object ( kubota et al .",
    "2010 ) , and the vph650 grism was used for observations of a high z star - forming galaxy ( oyama et al .",
    "2004 ) and of planetary nebulae in a nearby galaxy ( bresolin et al . 2010 ) .",
    "moreover , any number of observational results of subaru / focas with vph grisms will be published in the near future .",
    "five surface - relief grisms including the echelle grism were commissioned for common use between 2001 and 2003 .",
    "common use for the vph450 , vph520 , vph650 , vph680 , vph800 and vph950 grisms started between 2003 and 2006 .",
    "common use for the vph850 and vph900 grisms started in 2010 .",
    "the performances have been found to be consistent with the results such as were evaluated in the laboratory , since grisms have been in regular use . the second diffraction order of the low and middle red grisms are used in short wavelength region in combination with an appropriate filter .",
    "the echelle grism was designed for spectroscopy with wide wavelength coverage ; nevertheless , the second diffraction order of the grism is frequently used for a long - slit mode and multislit mode above 800 nm by combination of an appropriate filter .    since",
    "a vph grism has a dependence on the slit position and peak - efficiency wavelength , dome flats or twilight flats on observations are important for reduction , especially with multislit mode . from another viewpoint , the wavelength of the peak efficiency can be adjusted by the slit position . for examples ,",
    "the vph450 grism with an appropriate offset slits is suitable for a uv region ( 360@xmath5400 nm ) , and the vph850 or vph900 or vph950 grism with an appropriate offset slit is suitable for observations of galaxies with redshift above 7 ( wavelength above 1000 nm ) .",
    "although the specifications of the vph850 grism are similar to that of the middle red of surface - relief grism , the efficiency of the vph grism is higher than that of the surface - relief grism .",
    "this means that a vph grism is feasible for applications with moderate dispersion .",
    "we greatly appreciate m. kawabata and t. teranishi of nippon paint co. ltd . for supplying hologram resin .",
    "the grisms and cross disperser were developed at the request of national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) in collaboration with communication research laboratory ( present name is national institute of information and communications technology : nict ) , riken , japan women s university ( jwu ) , konan university , and nagoya university .",
    "m. yoshida of hiroshima university gave us valuable opinions on grism design .",
    "numerical calculation for the diffraction properties of the surface - relief grisms were partly performed by t. sasaki of naoj and m. goto of max planck institute .",
    "we thank m. watanabe , m. ishikawa , and m. irisawa and member of kodate laboratory of jwu for their contributions on vph grating fabrications and measurements .",
