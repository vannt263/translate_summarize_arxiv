    "a better analytical understanding of the hilbert space and ground state structure of multicomponent fractional quantum hall systems is needed to have a clear physical picture and to properly interpret the experimental data . in this article",
    "we make a contribution in this direction , studying the bilayer case at fractional values of the filling factor @xmath0 and the limit @xmath6 .",
    "according to jain s composite fermion picture @xcite , this is the case of @xmath7 quasiparticles ( 2 electrons bound to @xmath2 magnetic flux quanta each ) per landau site .",
    "the integer case @xmath3 has been extensively studied in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where the analysis of the ground state structure reveals the existence of ( in general ) three quantum phases , shortly denoted by : spin , canted and ppin @xcite , depending on which order parameter ( spin or pseudospin / layer ) dominates across the control parameter space : tunneling , zeeman , bias , etc , couplings [ see later on eq . ] .",
    "the fractional multicomponent case ( including multilayer , graphene , etc ) has also been addressed ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , for the bilayer quantum hall ( blqh ) system , the fractional case @xmath8 has been theoretically worked out in @xcite , having an excellent agreement with previous experimental results @xcite .    the variational states used to study the ground state and phase diagrams of ( multicomponent ) fractional qh systems are usually of laughlin @xcite ( phenomenological ) type .",
    "complementary descriptions are provided by halperin @xcite and haldane s @xcite scheme of hierarchy states , jain s composite fermion theory @xcite , hierarchy states by macdonald et al .",
    "@xcite , etc . in this article",
    "we shall use wave functions introduced previously by us in a series of papers , firstly for the bilayer case at fractional values @xmath0 @xcite and recently extended to the @xmath9-component case at @xmath10 in @xcite .",
    "we followed a group - theoretical approach that generalizes the classification of @xmath1 isospin states at @xmath3 according to the 6-dimensional irreducible totally antisymmetric representation @xmath11 $ ] of @xmath1 arising in the decomposition of @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath0 we constructed the @xmath13-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath1 which , in young tableau notation @xmath14 $ ] , consists of two rows ( two electrons ) of @xmath2 boxes ( flux quanta ) each [ see eq . ] .",
    "the corresponding phase space is the grassmannian @xmath4 $ ] , a picture that has also been considered in some extensions to @xmath9-component antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "the dimension @xmath13 of the corresponding hilbert space grows as @xmath15 since there are more and more ways of attaching flux quanta to the indistinguishable electrons .",
    "these states have been used to quantify interlayer coherence and entanglement in the blqh system at @xmath0 @xcite . here",
    "we test our grassmannian @xmath16 coherent states as variational states to study the quantum phase diagram ( according to gilmore s algorithm @xcite ) at filling factor @xmath0 , the case @xmath5 being recovered as a particular case @xcite .",
    "we shall see that the existence of the three quantum phases ( spin , canted and ppin ) is common to any @xmath2 , but the phase transition points depend on @xmath2 .",
    "we study the large isospin @xmath6 limit and realize that the canted region shrinks for high values of @xmath2 in the tunneling direction .",
    "we also analyze the quantum case through a numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian and compare the results with the mean field ( semiclassical ) case .",
    "we obtain good agreement between quantum and semiclassical results in the spin and ppin phases , but not in the canted phase , where we detect exactly @xmath2 energy - level crossings between the ground and first excited states for given values of the tunneling gap .",
    "therefore , this degeneracy problem becomes more apparent for higher @xmath2 .",
    "the fidelity ( overlap ) between variational and numerical ground states increases when we adapt our coherent states to a parity symmetry , as turns out also to occur in other quantum physical systems undergoing a second order qpt like the dicke model of atom - field interactions @xcite , vibron model of molecules @xcite , lipkin - meshkov - glick @xcite , etc .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following .",
    "in section [ sec2 ] we provide an oscillator realization of the @xmath17 operators and the landau - site hilbert space for @xmath0 , together with their matrix elements , which will be necessary for the quantum analysis addressed in section [ sec4 ] . more details can be found in references @xcite and appendices [ basissubsec ] and [ subseccs ] , which have been introduced for the sake of self - containedness .",
    "specially appendix [ subseccs ] , which contains the isospin-@xmath2 coherent states , essential for the semiclassical analysis of the model hamiltonian studied in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the landau - site hamiltonian governing the blqh system at @xmath0 is an adaptation of the one proposed in @xcite for @xmath5 to the many body case ( arbitrary @xmath2 ) . using our coherent states , we obtain in section [ sec3 ] the phase diagram ( in the balanced case , for simplicity ) for arbitrary @xmath2 and , in particular , we recover the results of @xcite for @xmath5",
    ". we also study the large isospin @xmath6 limit . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we analyze the quantum case through a numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian and compare the results with the mean field ( semiclassical ) case . for low and high interlayer tunneling ( spin and ppin phases ,",
    "respectively ) an analytical treatment of the hamiltonian reveals a formation of energy bands depending on angular momentum and layer population imbalance quantum numbers .",
    "we study the internal structure of these bands ( for other studies on band structure formation in the fqhe see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the last section is left for conclusions and outlook .",
    "blqh systems underlie an isospin @xmath17 symmetry . in order to emphasize the spin @xmath18 symmetry in the ,",
    "let us say , bottom @xmath19 ( pseudospin down ) and top @xmath20 or ( pseudospin up ) layers , it is customary to denote the @xmath17 generators in the four - dimensional fundamental representation by the sixteen @xmath21 matrices @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denote the usual pauli matrices @xmath24 , plus the identity @xmath25 . in the fractional case ,",
    "bosonic magnetic flux quanta are attached to the electrons to form composite fermions .",
    "let us denote by @xmath26 [ resp .",
    "@xmath27 creation operators of magnetic flux quanta ( flux quanta in the sequel ) attached to the electron @xmath28 with spin down [ resp . up ] at layer @xmath20 [ resp .",
    "@xmath19 ] , and so on . for the case of two electrons , @xmath30 , the four - component electron",
    "`` field '' @xmath31 is arranged as a compound @xmath32 of two fermions , so that the sixteen @xmath17 density operators are then written as bilinear products of creation and annihilation operators as ( the so called schwinger oscillator realization ) @xmath33 in the blqh literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) it is customary to denote the total spin @xmath34 and pseudospin @xmath35 , together with the remaining 9 isospin @xmath36 operators for @xmath37 .",
    "a constraint in the fock space of eight boson modes is imposed such that @xmath38 , with @xmath2 representing the number of magnetic flux lines piercing each electron and @xmath39 the @xmath40 identity . in particular ,",
    "the linear casimir operator @xmath41 , providing the total number of flux quanta , is fixed to @xmath42 , with @xmath43 the total number of flux quanta in layer @xmath20 ( resp . in layer @xmath19 ) . the quadratic casimir operator is also fixed to @xmath44 we also identify the interlayer imbalance operator @xmath45 , which measures the excess of flux quanta between layers @xmath20 and @xmath19 , that is @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the realization defines a unitary bosonic representation of the @xmath17 matrix generators @xmath47 in the fock space with constrains .",
    "this unitary irreducible representation arises in the clebsch - gordan decomposition of a tensor product of @xmath48 four - dimensional ( fundamental , elementary ) representations of @xmath17 ; for example , in young tableau notation : @xmath49 or @xmath50\\otimes\\dots\\otimes [ 1]}^{2\\lambda}=[\\lambda,\\lambda]\\oplus\\dots$ ] , where we wanted to highlight rectangular young tableaux of shapes @xmath14 $ ] ( 2 rows of @xmath2 boxes each ) corresponding to @xmath7 electrons pierced by @xmath2 magnetic flux lines ( i.e. , fractional filling factor @xmath0 ) .",
    "these are the young tableaux determining our carrier hilbert space @xmath51 associated to the eight - dimensional grassmannian phase spaces @xmath52 ( see @xcite for similar pictures in @xmath9-component antiferromagnets ) .",
    "the dimension of this representation can be calculated by the hook - length formula and gives @xmath53 in references @xcite we have also provided a physical argument to derive the expression of @xmath13 in a composite fermion picture .",
    "it turns out to coincide with the total number of ways to distribute @xmath48 flux quanta among two identical electrons in four ( spin - pseudospin ) states .",
    "note that quantum states associated to young tableaux @xmath14 $ ] are antisymmetric ( fermionic character ) under the interchange of the two electrons ( two rows ) for @xmath2 odd , whereas they are symmetric ( bosonic character ) for @xmath2 even .",
    "composite fermions require then @xmath2 odd .    in refs .",
    "@xcite we have worked out an orthonormal basis of the carrier hilbert space @xmath54 , which is spanned by the set of orthonormal basis vectors @xmath55 which can be written in terms of fock states ( to be self - contained , we give a brief in appendix [ basissubsec ] ) .",
    "the basis states @xmath56 turn out to be antisymmetric ( resp .",
    "symmetric ) under the interchange of the two electrons for @xmath2 odd ( resp .",
    "even ) , so that the parity of the number of flux quanta attached to each electron affects the quantum statistics of the compound ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath57-dimensional irrep of @xmath1 is usually divided into two sectors ( see e.g. @xcite ) : the spin sector with spin - triplet pseudospin - singlet states @xmath58 and the ppin sector with pseudospin - triplet spin - singlet states @xmath59    the basis states @xmath56 are eigenstates of the following operators : p_3|_q_a , q_b^j , m&=&(2j+2m-)|_q_a , q_b^j , m , + ( _ a^2+_b^2)|_q_a , q_b^j , m&=&2j(j+1)|_q_a , q_b^j , m,[ccoc ] + s_3|_q_a , q_b^j , m&=&q_|_q_a , q_b^j , m , = a , b , where we have defined angular momentum operators in layers @xmath20 and @xmath19 as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , so that @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , @xmath63 represents the total angular momentum of layers @xmath20 and @xmath19 , whereas @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the corresponding third components .",
    "the integer @xmath66 is related to the interlayer imbalance ( ppin third component @xmath67 ) through @xmath68 ; thus , @xmath69 means @xmath70",
    "( i.e. , all flux quanta occupying layer @xmath20 ) , whereas @xmath71 means @xmath72 ( i.e. , all flux quanta occupying layer @xmath19 ) .",
    "the angular momentum third components @xmath73 measure the imbalance between spin up and down in each layer , more precisely , @xmath74 and similarly for @xmath65 . for later use",
    ", we shall also provide the matrix elements of the interlayer tunneling operator @xmath75 where the coefficients @xmath76 where calculated in @xcite and are given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "the total landau - site hamiltonian governing the bilayer qh system consists of coulomb and a combination of zeeman and pseudo - zeeman interactions @xcite @xmath80 in particular , we are just interested in the hamiltonian reproducing the ground state energy which , for @xmath3 gives ( we discard @xmath1-invariant terms ) @xmath81 as a sum of the naive capacitance ( @xmath82 ) and the exchange ( @xmath83 ) interactions .",
    "the exchange and capacitance energy gaps are given in terms of the interlayer distance @xmath84 by @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the coulomb energy unit and @xmath88 the magnetic length . in the following",
    "we shall simply put @xmath89 and @xmath90 as no confusion will arise .",
    "we shall usually choose @xmath91 , which gives @xmath92 in coulomb units .",
    "the ( pseudo ) zeeman part @xmath93 is comprised of : zeeman ( @xmath94 ) , interlayer tunneling ( @xmath95 , also denoted by @xmath96 in the literature @xcite ) and bias ( @xmath97 ) gaps .",
    "the bias term creates an imbalanced configuration . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the balanced case in the semiclassical study , which eventually means to discard the therms proportional to @xmath98 and @xmath97 ; we shall take capacitance and bias into account in the quantum analysis of section [ sec4 ] .",
    "a minimization process of the ground state energy surface ( based on a semiclassical analysis ) reveals the existence of three quantum phases : spin , canted and pseudospin ( ppin for short ) , which are characterized by the squared spin @xmath99 and ppin @xmath100 ground state mean values ( order parameters ) , as in figure [ figfases ] and table [ tabla ] for @xmath5 .",
    ".[tabla ] spin and ppin ground state mean values in the three blqh phases . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for large tunneling @xmath101 ( ppin phase ) , energy bands are formed around the eigenvalues of the ppin first component @xmath102 , that is , at energies about @xmath103 , since the eigenvalues of @xmath102 and @xmath67 coincide ( actually , the discussion also applies for large bias voltage ) .",
    "therefore , the number of energy bands arising at high @xmath101 is exactly @xmath104 [ remember discussion in paragraph between and ] .",
    "we can label each band by @xmath105 [ the homogeneity degree of polynomials ] and the number of closely spaced energy levels forming each energy band @xmath106 is @xmath107 one can verify that @xmath108 gives the dimension of the hilbert space . at intermediate tunneling ( canted phase ) there is an intricate spectrum structure with multiple band - crossing .",
    "the physics of multicomponent quantum hall systems , and particularly the bilayer case , is very rich .",
    "the fractional case incorporates extra ingredients that makes the problem even much more interesting . in this article",
    "we have analyzed the bilayer ( four components ) case at fractional values @xmath0 of the filling factor .",
    "we have obtained the phase diagram structure of the balanced case by using an overcomplete set of coherent ( semiclassical ) variational states previously introduced .",
    "the hamiltonian used is an adaptation of the integer case , @xmath3 , to an arbitrary number of magnetic flux quanta @xmath2 per electron , to make it intensive and to study the large @xmath1-isospin @xmath2 limit .",
    "up to our knowledge , an study of this type has not been done before .",
    "we have also performed a numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian and compared exact ( quantum ) with mean - field ( semiclassical ) results for the ground state .",
    "the accordance is quite good in the spin and ppin phases , but not in the canted phase , where degeneracies and energy level crossings occur , specially at large @xmath2 .",
    "we have also analyzed the full energy spectrum and we have found an energy band arrangement in spin and ppin phases .",
    "the particular structure of these energy bands has also been analyzed in terms of angular momentum and layer population imbalance quantum numbers .",
    "an experimental corroboration of these band energy formation would enforce our theoretical work .",
    "to finish , just to say that a generalization of the previous study to arbitrary @xmath9 component quantum hall systems at fractional filling factors @xmath10 could also be ( in principle ) carried out with the help of our recent construction of @xmath109 $ ] coherent states @xcite ( this is still work in progress ) .",

    "<S> the existence of three quantum phases ( spin , canted and ppin ) is common to any @xmath2 , but the phase transition points depend on @xmath2 , and the instance @xmath5 is recovered as a particular case . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the quantum case through a numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian and compare with the mean - field results , which give a good approximation in the spin and ppin phases but not in the canted phase , where we detect exactly @xmath2 energy level crossings between the ground and first excited state for given values of the tunneling gap . </S>",
    "<S> an energy band structure at low and high interlayer tunneling ( spin and ppin phases , respectively ) also appears depending on angular momentum and layer population imbalance quantum numbers . </S>"
