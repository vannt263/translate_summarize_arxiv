    "type i planetary migration is one of serious difficulties in the theory of planet formation and there have been a lot of work on this topic . for an unmagnetized disk ,",
    "extensive linear perturbation analyses have been performed since goldreich & tremaine s pioneering work ( goldreich & tremaine , 1979 ) .",
    "the recent result by tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) has shown that the protoplanet of 5m@xmath0 located at 5au and embedded in the minimum - mass solar nebula @xcite will migrate inward to the central star in @xmath1 years , shorter than the observed time scale of protoplanetary disk , @xmath2 years ( see e.g. , haisch et al .",
    "their results are confirmed by numerical calculations ( see e.g. , dangelo et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "most of analytic works on type i planetary migration have focused on unmagnetized , locally isothermal disks .",
    "goldreich & tremaine ( 1979 ) considered the two - dimensional disk , that is , there is no structure in the vertical direction of the disk , and derived analytic formulae of the torque exerted at lindblad and corotation resonances . in order to calculate the migration rate ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate the difference of the torque exerted on the disk inside and outside of the planet .",
    "this is done by ward ( 1986 ) .",
    "later , artymowicz ( 1993 ) derived , without invoking wkb approximation , a generalized formula for lindblad resonances including the cutoff of the torque for high azimuthal mode number .",
    "three - dimensional analysis is performed by takeuchi & miyama ( 1998 ) , tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and zhang & lai ( 2006 ) .",
    "takeuchi & miyama ( 1998 ) derived torque formulae for some resonances and full analytic calculation was performed by zhang & lai ( 2006 ) . when the planet is embedded in the equatorial plane of a thin disk ,",
    "three - dimensional modes have been shown to be ineffective ( tanaka et al . 2002 ) .",
    "in contrast to all the above studies , magnetic fields are supposed to be present in protoplanetary disks .",
    "significant mass accretion onto the central star requires an effective mechanism for angular momentum transfer . at present , magneto - rotational instability , or mri ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) ,",
    "is the most likely mechanism for the generation of turbulent viscosity in the disks .",
    "however , whether the disk is magnetically active or dead depends strongly on the amount of gas ( and hence , dust ) , number density , and the properties ( size distribution etc . ) of the dust grains because the surfaces of the dust grains are very efficient sites of recombination ( gammie 1996 , sano et al .",
    "the detailed analysis of the ionization structure with the standard cosmic ray ionization rate simply predicts that the planet forming region ( approximately between 0.1au and 10au from the central star ) might be in the dead zone where gas and magnetic field do not couple .",
    "however , various effects can change this prediction : the growth of dust grains to larger particles decreases the total surface area for recombination , and hence , increases the ionization degree .",
    "sedimentation of dust grains onto the disk midplane also increases the ionization degree of most of the height of the disk .",
    "yet another mechanism to increase the ionization rate is also proposed , which possibly removes the dead zone in the standard solar nebular model ( inutsuka & sano 2005 ) .",
    "the property of planetary migration may be totally different if magnetic field is important .",
    "nelson and papaloizou ( 2004 ) performed numerical calculations of type i migration in a magnetized disk and indicated that the turbulence due to mri would result in stochastic torque on the planet .",
    "a simple model for the random torque was presented by laughlin et al .",
    "terquem ( 2003 ) performed the linear analysis of the torque for two - dimensional laminar disk with toroidal magnetic field and indicated that when stronger magnetic field was exerted on the disk inside the planet s orbit than the outside , inward migration might be halted .",
    "fromang et al . (",
    "2005 ) further investigated this situation by numerical calculation and the numerical results showed good agreement with linear analysis .    in this paper , we investigate the type i planetary migration when the disk is exerted by poloidal magnetic field , which is a complementary analysis to terquem ( 2003 ) . as a first step to understand the nature of migration in a magnetized disk , we perform shearing sheet analysis , which assumes symmetric structure inside and outside the planet s orbit , and calculate the torque exerted on one side of the disk .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a laminar disk , the case without mri , and derive analytic formulae of torque exerted on some important resonances .",
    "we perform a three - dimensional calculation and our formalism is a natural extension of previous studies of unmagnetized cases that is developed by goldreich and tremaine ( 1979 ) and artymowicz ( 1993 ) . for two - dimensional modes ,",
    "we derive an analytic formula which generalizes that of artymowicz ( 1993 ) . for three - dimensional modes ,",
    "we employ wkb approximation and derive an analytic torque formula in a strong field limit .",
    "we show , for three - dimensional modes , that there is a divergence in perturbed density at certain resonances and the torque is localized at this point .",
    "we describe how to treat the singularity in the wave equation .",
    "we show that two - dimensional modes are suppressed by poloidal magnetic field and three - dimensional modes will dominate the total torque .",
    "we then compare the results of the linear analysis with a numerical calculation , and show good agreement .",
    "type i migration in a disk with strong poloidal magnetic field may be also important in the formation of planets around neutron stars ( e.g. , bailes et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ linear ] , we describe the linear analysis . in section [ simu ] , we describe the numerical calculation .",
    "section [ compare ] compares the results of linear analysis and numerical calculation .",
    "we discuss some possible important points that are not covered in this analysis in section [ discussion ] , and section [ summary ] is for our summary .",
    "in this section , we derive analytic formulae for the torque exerted on the disk by the planet by linear analysis .",
    "the backreaction exerted on the planet causes orbital migration .",
    "for simplicity , we consider only a local region around the planet using shearing sheet model @xcite .",
    "although it gives the same magnitude but the opposite sign of the torque between the inner and outer regions of the planet so the net torque becomes zero , we focus on one side of the disk in this setup and simplify the problem to understand the effect of magnetic field . we assume that the temperature is constant and the self - gravity of the disk is negligible in this local region .",
    "the orbit of the protoplanet is assumed to be circular on the equatorial plane of the disk .",
    "we set up local cartesian coordinates with origin at the protoplanet s position and the @xmath3- , @xmath4- , and @xmath5-axes are radial , azimuthal , and vertical direction of the disk , respectively .",
    "we use ideal mhd equations : @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the gas density , velocity , gas pressure , effective potential including tidal force and the planet s gravitational potential , keplerian angular velocity of the protoplanet , a unit vector directed to the @xmath5-axis , and the magnetic flux density , respectively .",
    "we adopt an isothermal equation of state , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is sound speed .",
    "the keplerian angular velocity of the protoplanet is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the gravitational constant , mass of the central star , and the distance between the protoplanet and the central star , respectively .",
    "our calculations are normalized by unit time , @xmath22 , unit velocity , @xmath17 , and unit length , @xmath23 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath12 in our normalization is given by , assuming a keplerian disk , @xmath24 where all the quantities with tilde indicate the normalized value .",
    "the first term of the right hand side of equation ( [ effective ] ) is composed of the gravitational potential of the central star and the centrifugal potential , and higher orders in @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are neglected .",
    "we also neglect the @xmath5-dependence of the gravitational potential of the central star for simplicity , and consider later the constant background density .",
    "this greatly simplifies the calculation , and we have found that it does not seriously affect the results .",
    "the second term of the right hand side of equation ( [ effective ] ) is the gravitational potential of the protoplanet , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are normalized hill radius and the distance from the center of the protoplanet respectively .",
    "the hill radius is defined by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the mass of the protoplanet .",
    "the background disk is assumed to have no planet .",
    "the background gas flow has a keplerian shear , @xmath29 , background density is assumed to be constant , @xmath30 , and the background magnetic field is assumed to be constant and poloidal , @xmath31 .",
    "we denote all the background quantities with subscript zero .",
    "we treat the planet as a perturber on this background disk and derive the stationary pattern excited by the planet , as in goldreich & tremaine ( 1979 ) .",
    "we denote perturbed quantities with @xmath32 , e.g. , density perturbation is denoted as @xmath33 .",
    "we fourier transform in @xmath34- , @xmath4- , and @xmath5-directions , i.e. , we shall consider the solution of the form @xmath35 $ ] . since we consider the stationary pattern , the frequency @xmath36 is zero .",
    "the perturbed quantities are then @xmath37 and the inverse transformation is @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the box sizes of @xmath4- and @xmath5-directions respectively . imposing periodic boundary conditions in @xmath4- and @xmath5- directions , the wave numbers in these directions are @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are integer .",
    "we shall drop the subscripts @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the fourier modes unless it is ambiguous .",
    "we define the lagrangian displacement @xmath47 by @xmath48 where @xmath49    using the lagrangian displacement , the linearized induction equations are @xmath50 the equation of continuity is @xmath51 and the equations of motion become , using the induction equations , @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the alfvn  velocity of the background gas .",
    "we shall also define , for later convenience , the plasma @xmath54 by @xmath55 .",
    "the equations ( [ pert_eoc ] ) , ( [ pert_eomx ] ) , ( [ pert_eomy ] ) and ( [ pert_eomz ] ) are four independent equations for four variables @xmath33 and @xmath47 .",
    "the boundary conditions to be imposed are such that wave excited propagate away from the planet in both inner and outer parts of the disk .",
    "once the wave pattern is derived for each fourier mode , @xmath5-component of the torque , of which backreaction causes the orbital migration , exerted on the disk by the planet for each mode is calculated by @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the imaginary part .",
    "we shall investigate the wave propagation property of the disk with poloidal magnetic field .",
    "first , we derive a wave equation from ( [ pert_eoc])-([pert_eomz ] ) .",
    "the @xmath3- and @xmath4-components of the equations of motion can be written @xmath58 where @xmath59 is defined by @xmath60.\\ ] ] equations ( [ eqn1 ] ) and ( [ eqn2 ] ) are the generalization of equation ( 10 ) of goldreich & tremaine ( 1979 ) .",
    "variable @xmath59 is related to the perturbation of total pressure @xmath61 by @xmath62 therefore , it is a natural extension of the variable used by goldreich & tremaine ( 1979 ) that is @xmath63 . solving for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , \\\\ & \\xi_y = { { \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{d } }   } \\left [ -2i\\omega_p \\sigma { { \\displaystyle \\frac{df}{dx } }   }               + \\left ( \\sigma^2 + 3\\omega_p^2 - v_a^2 k_z^2                \\right ) ik_y f \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is @xmath68 this generalizes what is denoted by @xmath67 in the case of unmagnetized disk , e.g. , equation ( 12 ) of goldreich & tremaine ( 1979 ) .",
    "note that in the absence of magnetic field , @xmath67 is a quadratic function of @xmath69 , while this becomes a quartic function in the present situation . from equations ( [ pert_eoc ] ) and ( [ pert_eomz ] ) ,",
    "we finally obtain a second order ordinary differential equation which describes wave excitation and propagation of the disk , @xmath70 where @xmath71    imposing wkb approximation , @xmath72 , this equation simplifies to + schrdinger type : @xmath73 where @xmath74 the regions where @xmath75 are wave propagation regions , and those where @xmath76 are evanescent .",
    "the boundary between these regions , where @xmath77 or @xmath78 , is the resonances .",
    "figure [ fig : pot ] shows the appropriately normalized potential @xmath79 for disk with @xmath80 and mode @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "there are two or three points where @xmath77 in one side of the disk with respect to the planet ( either @xmath83 or @xmath84 ) , depending on the value of @xmath54 . from the condition @xmath85",
    ", we have @xmath86\\ ] ] we call the point with positive sign lindblad resonance plus ( lr@xmath87 ) and with negative sign lindblad resonance minus ( lr@xmath88 ) . in the unmagnetized disk ,",
    "lr@xmath87 coincides with the usual lindblad resonance , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the epicycle frequency , and lr@xmath88 degenerates into corotation point .",
    "we note that lr@xmath88 exists only when @xmath91 , which is exactly the same as the stability condition against mri @xcite .",
    "when lr@xmath88 does not exist but @xmath92 , the corotation region becomes a wave propagation region .",
    "since @xmath93 at the corotation , this indicates that there is a mode with zero frequency but non - zero wavelength , and therefore , in general , there is an unstable mode .",
    "another condition for @xmath94 is @xmath95 this condition does not depend on magnetic field strength .",
    "this resonance corresponds to that found by takeuchi & miyama ( 1998 ) and is named `` vertical resonance '' by zhang & lai ( 2006 ) .",
    "we shall also call this point vertical resonance ( vr ) in this paper .",
    "there are two points in one side of the disk where @xmath79 diverges .",
    "one is given by @xmath96 at this point , the radial wavelength of alfvn  wave becomes zero .",
    "we shall call this point alfvn  resonance ( ar ) . note that this divergence is related to what is called alfvn  resonance in plasma physics ( see e.g. , stix 1992 ) .",
    "the other point where @xmath79 diverges is given by @xmath97 at this point , the wavelength of the slow mode becomes zero , and this corresponds to `` magnetic resonance '' found by terquem ( 2003 ) in the analysis of toroidal field .",
    "therefore , we shall also call this point magnetic resonance ( mr ) in this paper .    for two - dimensional modes , @xmath98 , only lr+ exists , and the region in the vicinity of the corotation is evanescent region , whereas the regions further away from lr+ are propagation regions .",
    "the details of the wave propagation property of the disk depend on the value of @xmath54 and @xmath46 , but in general , there are three propagation regions on one side of the corotation , corresponding to the three wave modes of the magnetohydrodynamics",
    ". there are only two propagation regions in the analysis of terquem ( 2003 ) , since the mode is restricted to @xmath98 and the alfvn  wave with @xmath99 is not taken into account .",
    "figure [ fig : waveprop ] shows the wave propagation property of one side of the disk in the case of @xmath100 .    with careful investigation of the properties of the resonances ,",
    "it is possible to analyze the wave excitation , propagation , and absorption . in this paper , however , we calculate the torque in some restricted cases and compare the results with numerical calculation .",
    "we first investigate the case when @xmath98 .",
    "we then calculate three dimensional modes , @xmath92 , when very strong magnetic field is exerted . in these cases",
    ", mri does not occur @xcite , and we expect the wave pattern becomes stationary with respect to the planet s motion .",
    "we consider the two - dimensional , or @xmath98 , mode . in this case",
    "it is possible to calculate the torque exerted on the disk without imposing wkb approximation . when @xmath98 , it is clear from equation ( [ pert_eomz ] ) that the fluid particles do not move along @xmath5-axis , @xmath101 , and the effect of magnetic field appears only in the pressure term .",
    "the sound speed becomes the phase velocity of the fast mode , @xmath102 , and this acts as an effective sound speed .",
    "we can then follow the track of artymowicz ( 1993 ) and calculate the torque exerted on the disk by evaluating the angular momentum flux carried by the wave at @xmath103 .",
    "the position of the effective lindblad resonance is given by @xmath104 when @xmath105 the resonances inside and outside of the corotation radius are well isolated each other , and the torque exerted on the disk may be evaluated by the strength of the gravitational potential of the planet at the resonance point .",
    "the modified formula of the torque is @xmath106 where @xmath107 details of the derivation are given in appendix [ app:2dtq ] .",
    "the equation ( [ tq_art ] ) generalizes the equation ( 56 ) of artymowicz ( 1993 ) to a magnetized disk .",
    "since the effective sound speed becomes faster when poloidal magnetic fields present , the magnitude of the torque becomes smaller .",
    "there are two kinds of cutoff mechanism of the torque , as artymowicz ( 1993 ) pointed out .",
    "one is mild cutoff that comes from the coefficient of @xmath108 .",
    "the other is the sharp cutoff , which is the consequence of the fact that position of the effective lindblad resonance goes further away from the corotation when magnetic field is stronger . in the case of planetary migration ,",
    "the effect of sharp cutoff is more important , and the torque by two - dimensional mode is strongly suppressed when @xmath109 .",
    "we emphasize that we have obtained the torque formula ( [ tq_art ] ) including the torque cutoff at high @xmath45 mode because we have not imposed wkb approximation , and hence , not neglected terms with @xmath45 .      in the unmagnetized disk ,",
    "the contribution from three - dimensional , or @xmath92 , mode is small @xcite .",
    "however , it is indicated in the previous section that the two - dimensional mode is strongly suppressed when strong magnetic field is present .",
    "therefore three dimensional mode may be important in this case .",
    "we investigate three - dimensional mode in the limit of @xmath110 .",
    "we impose wkb approximation in this section .    in the limit of @xmath111 , the resonances lr+ , lr- , and ar are infinitely far away from the corotation and we can safely neglect their contribution .",
    "the other two resonances , mr and vr , degenerate and the equation ( [ eqn_prop ] ) becomes @xmath112 where the source term @xmath113 is @xmath114 in this case , waves are evanescent in the vicinity of the corotation , but there is a singularity in the source term at the degenerate point of mr and vr , @xmath115 the subscript mr denotes the quantities evaluated at this point . note that this divergence originally comes from the divergence of the source term ( [ sources ] ) at mr .    in order to regularize the singularity , we consider the small viscosity effective only in the vicinity of this point . the viscosity is effectively taken into account by adding the small positive imaginary part to the frequency , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is small positive number ( see e.g. , meyer - vernet and sicardy 1987 ) . taking the limit of @xmath118 , @xmath119 where @xmath120 is an arbitrary smooth function , @xmath121 denotes the principal value of the integration and @xmath122 is the dirac s delta function .",

    "it is clear that , with increasing magnetic field , the amplitude of the wave becomes small and the point where waves are excited goes further away from the planet .",

    "it is clear that the torque becomes weaker as the magnetic field is stronger .",
    "we show in figure [ fig:2dtq_compare ] the comparison between the results of numerical calculation and linear analysis , equation ( [ tq_art ] ) .",
    "it is clear that for modes that satisfy condition ( [ cond : art ] ) , which we expect that equation ( [ tq_art ] ) gives a good approximation for the torque , numerical calculation and linear analysis indeed show reasonably good agreement , at least an order of magnitude , even though equation ( [ tq_art ] ) estimates the torque by the value of density perturbation only at the position of effective lindblad resonance .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ tq_art ] ) is useful for estimating two - dimensional torque when poloidal magnetic field is exerted on the disk .",
    "we also checked that the numerical calculation and linear analysis are in good agreement for other values of @xmath54 except for @xmath180 . for @xmath180 , since the amplitude of density perturbation is very small , numerical torque is dominated by small noise in the disk .      for @xmath177 and @xmath180 models of the three - dimensional calculations , we do not observe mri and steady state is realized . for other parameters ,",
    "we observe the instability .",
    "since we investigate the stationary pattern , we focus on results in which we do not observe mri .",
    "we show in figure [ fig:3dtq_num ] the torque that is derived from numerical calculation for @xmath181 , where @xmath44 is the mode number of @xmath5-direction .",
    "it is clear that @xmath182 modes overwhelm the two - dimensional modes in these models .",
    "figure [ fig:3dtq_comp ] compares the torque calculated from the three - dimensional numerical calculations and that calculated from linear analysis of @xmath182 modes , torque formula ( [ tq_mr ] ) . from the derivation of formula ( [ tq_mr ] ) , this expression of the torque is valid when wkb condition @xmath183 and strong magnetic field condition ( [ fieldcond ] ) are both satisfied . in the present parameter , the wkb condition is more restrictive . since @xmath184 for @xmath182 mode , we expect that for @xmath185 greater than this value , equation ( [ tq_mr ] ) does not give a good approximation for the torque .",
    "nevertheless , the result of the numerical calculation indicates that the equation ( [ tq_mr ] ) shows a very good agreement even in the modes with @xmath185 greater than this limit .",
    "we also find that the imaginary part of the fourier components of density perturbation diverges around mr , as expected from linear analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : denspert_3d ] shows the profile of the imaginary part of the density perturbation of @xmath180 calculation for @xmath186 .",
    "the position of magnetic resonance is indicated by an arrow .",
    "it is clear that density perturbation diverges at the resonance position and the contribution of the torque mostly comes from this divergence .",
    "the torque is localized at the magnetic resonances since waves can not propagate on the disk , and , therefore , the analytic torque formula ( [ tq_mr ] ) gives a good approximation of the total torque , even if we consider the regions only in the vicinity of the resonance .",
    "tanaka et al . ( 2002 ) has shown that in the unmagnetized disk , three - dimensional modes are subdominant .",
    "in contrast , when poloidal magnetic field is exerted on the disk , it is indicated that three - dimensional modes can dominate the torque when the magnetic field is sufficiently strong . in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the critical value of @xmath54 at which @xmath92 modes dominate the total torque in a thin magnetized disk according to the results of linear analysis . by `` thin disk '' , we refer to the disk with small aspect ratio , smaller than that we have used in the numerical calculation , but not two - dimensional .",
    "we calculate the torque for @xmath187 modes by ( [ tq_art ] ) and @xmath188 modes by ( [ tq_mr ] ) .",
    "the fourier transformation of the planet s gravitational potential is done numerically with the box size @xmath189 and the spatial resolution @xmath190 .",
    "we have checked that @xmath191 modes are smaller than @xmath182 modes .",
    "figure [ fig : thin_2d ] shows the torque for @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 .",
    "the vertical wavenumber of @xmath182 modes is @xmath192 , and wkb approximation is valid for @xmath193 less than this value . for thin disk case , it is indicated , just as thick disk case , that two - dimensional modes are dominant for a weak magnetic field , while three - dimensional modes are important for a strong magnetic field case .",
    "we have investigated other values of @xmath54 and it is indicated that for the disk with @xmath194 , three - dimensional modes are more important than two - dimensional modes .    since three - dimensional torque formula ( [ tq_mr ] ) is valid only in the strong magnetic field limit , it is not possible to extrapolate this to the case with @xmath195 .",
    "however , since the torque formula for two - dimensional modes ( [ tq_art ] ) does not have any restriction , we can safely conclude that @xmath98 modes are always suppressed for strong magnetic field .",
    "therefore , qualitatively , we expect that two - dimensional modes are suppressed for @xmath109 . to verify this conjecture quantitatively , we need careful analysis for @xmath196 case , which will be presented elsewhere ( t. muto and s. inutsuka 2008 , in preparation ) .      for an unmagnetized disk",
    ", it is known that the outer torque that is exerted by the disk outside the planet wins over the inner torque exerted by the disk inside , when the disk gas density is larger in the inner disk than the outer @xcite .",
    "this is the result of the competition of two effects . on one hand ,",
    "since the inner density is larger than the outer , the inner torque becomes larger than the outer . on the other hand , the effect called pressure buffer enhances the outer torque .",
    "considering the background disk structure , gas is slightly sub - keplerian resulting from the outward pressure gradient .",
    "since the planet is in keplerian rotation , the corotation point locates slightly inside the planet , which makes the outer lindblad resonance slightly closer to the planet .",
    "calculating the difference of these two competing effects , the outer torque is larger than the inner torque .",
    "let us now qualitatively discuss the differential torque in the disk with poloidal magnetic field .",
    "first , we consider the two - dimensional mode when magnetic field exerted on the disk inside the planet s orbit is larger than the outside . in the case without variation in density and temperature",
    ", the mild cutoff of the torque by magnetic field makes the outer torque stronger .",
    "if the disk has radially decreasing magnetic pressure distribution , the planet locates slightly outside the corotation point since outward magnetic pressure is exerted on the gas .",
    "this also enhances the outer torque , since the outer effective lindblad resonance locates closer to the planet .",
    "the outer torque is , therefore , expected to be stronger because of these two effects , in contrast to the toroidal magnetic field case of terquem ( 2003 ) where the inner torque is stronger .",
    "this might indicate that the differential torque may be very sensitive to the configuration of magnetic field near the planet .",
    "we now turn to the magnetic resonances of @xmath92 modes , effective for low @xmath54 . since the formula ( [ tq_mr ] ) is for the limiting case of @xmath127 , the torque does not depend on the magnetic field strength .",
    "we shall propose a simple torque formula for mr which generalizes equation ( [ tq_mr ] ) and discuss the effect of magnetic field .",
    "firstly , we note that the relation between @xmath131 and @xmath129 is given by @xmath197.\\ ] ] since @xmath131 in the right hand side can be neglected when @xmath110 , we expect this term can be neglected even in @xmath198 , provided that @xmath54 is sufficiently small .",
    "this equation also indicates that there is a @xmath32-function - like divergence at mr . neglecting the term with @xmath131 , we obtain the following torque formula at mr for low @xmath54 , @xmath199 where the value of gravitational potential is evaluated at mr .",
    "the smaller the magnetic field strength is , the closer towards the planet the mr position locates , which makes the gravitational potential at mr , @xmath200 , stronger .",
    "however , the coefficient , @xmath201 , becomes smaller , which makes the evaluation complicated . using the parameters with three - dimensional torque calculation",
    ", we evaluate the fourier transform of the gravitational potential and calculate the torque .",
    "figure [ fig : mrtq_dis ] shows the torque calculated from the modified formula ( [ tq_mr_mod ] ) for @xmath180 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 .",
    "it is indicated that mr torque becomes smaller for weaker magnetic field strength .",
    "therefore , we expect that when the inner magnetic field is stronger than the outer magnetic field and the field strength is high enough for @xmath204 modes to be dominant , the inner torque wins over outer torque , in analogous to the results of the analysis of toroidal field by terquem ( 2003 )",
    ".    when magnetic field is very strong , equation ( [ tq_mr_mod ] ) indicates that the value of the torque is not sensitive to the strength of the field , and the differential torque can be very small .",
    "we consider , then , the effect of the gradient of sound speed , which changes the location of the resonance even in @xmath111 limit .",
    "let us consider the disk with higher sound speed inside .",
    "the outer mr , which nearly degenerates with vr , is closer to the planet , giving a larger value of gravitational potential .",
    "the coefficient of the gravitational potential in equation ( [ tq_mr ] ) is inversely proportional to the sound speed because @xmath205 is the mode number of the @xmath5-direction that is indifferent to the value of @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the coefficient is smaller for the inner mr than the outer mr .",
    "the outer torque is expected to be stronger than the inner torque when magnetic field is very strong and when there is a negative gradient of the sound speed .",
    "the qualitative dependence on magnetic field of the differential torque for laminar modes may be summarized as follows .",
    "consider the case where inner magnetic field is stronger than the outer .",
    "when magnetic field strength is weak and two - dimensional modes are dominant , the outer torque is more enhanced and the migration is inward . when magnetic field is strong enough for three - dimensional modes to be dominant , the migration can be outward .",
    "note , however , that the rate and directions of migration may depend sensitively on the gradient of the sound speed @xmath17 .",
    "negative gradient of the sound speed may cause the inward migration for very low @xmath54 .",
    "it seems difficult to halt the inward migration in a disk with strong poloidal magnetic field , since outward migration may require positive gradient of sound speed .",
    "note , however , that the typical magnitude of one - sided torque is always smaller than the unmagnetized case , as shown in figure [ fig : thin_2d ] . in the disk with @xmath206 ,",
    "the torque is dominated by two - dimensional modes and its magnitude is approximately @xmath207 in our normalization , while in @xmath177 case , the magnitude is smaller by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the strong magnetization of disk is expected to slow down the migration .",
    "actually this outcome is analogous to the effect of increasing gas temperature , and hence , thermal pressure and sound speed in the disk without magnetic field .      in this paper , we have considered a protoplanetary disk threaded by a poloidal magnetic field . in the analysis of the torque at the magnetic resonance , we have considered a strong magnetic field case and derived a torque formula ( [ tq_mr ] ) .",
    "we now consider briefly the more general case when toroidal component of magnetic field also exists .",
    "although it is necessary to make a full , rigorous calculation including both poloidal and toroidal components of magnetic field in the background disk , we make a qualitative discussion by comparing the effect of magnetic resonances of purely toroidal and that of purely poloidal case .    in the case of toroidal magnetic field",
    ", there is a magnetic resonance in two - dimensional modes too ( terquem 2003 ) . in the strong field limit ,",
    "the position of the magnetic resonance is given by @xmath208 since the magnetic resonance in poloidal case is located at @xmath209 and in a thin disk , modes @xmath210 are important , the magnetic resonance of a toroidal field is closer to the planet than the toroidal case .",
    "we also note that the fourier components of three - dimensional modes of gravitational potential are much smaller than the two - dimensional modes , as shown by tanaka et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , in a standard case of a planet on a circular orbit embedded in a disk midplane , we expect that when the net magnetic field is dominated by toroidal components , the effect of poloidal magnetic field is small compared to that of a toroidal field .",
    "a possible exception is provided by a large inclination of planet s orbit . in this case",
    ", the gravitational potential of planet has a large z - component ( three - dimensional modes ) , and thus , the poloidal field would be important .",
    "note , however , that we need a new set of analyses for the case of a planet with inclined orbit ( for unmagnetized disks , see tanaka & ward 2004 ) .",
    "we have performed linear perturbation analysis to calculate the torque exerted on the planet embedded in the non - turbulent disk with poloidal magnetic field using the shearing sheet approximation .",
    "we have derived a second order ordinary differential equation describing the excitation and propagation of the wave , equation ( [ eqn_prop ] ) , and derived analytic expressions of the torque for two limiting cases .",
    "equation ( [ tq_art ] ) gives the torque for two - dimensional modes .",
    "equation ( [ tq_mr ] ) gives the torque for three - dimensional modes for @xmath211 under wkb approximation .",
    "we have compared the result of the linear analysis and numerical calculation , and found that both formulae show reasonable agreement .",
    "we have shown that the two - dimensional modes are suppressed when magnetic field is strong , in contrast to terquem ( 2003 ) analysis of toroidal field , indicating that the property of planetary migration may be sensitive to the configuration of the magnetic field around the planet .",
    "it is also indicated that when magnetic field is very strong , three - dimensional modes are more effective than the two - dimensional modes , in contrast to the analysis of the three - dimensional calculation of unmagnetized disk by tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 )    since we have been using the shearing sheet approximation and have derived the torque formulae only in restricted cases , the analysis of more general cases and other resonances is necessary , which will appear elsewhere ( t. muto and s. inutsuka 2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "although the equation ( [ tq_mr ] ) agrees well with the numerical calculations , this is derived under wkb approximation .",
    "therefore , we need careful analysis for high @xmath45 for three - dimensional modes .",
    "we also need more quantitative analysis of the differential torque , which determines the direction and rate of the migration of the planet .",
