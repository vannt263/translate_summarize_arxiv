    "the question whether there exists an underlying principle to understand the pattern of lepton mixing , which is quite different from the quark mixing , demands the study of neutrino mass matrix as well as the charged lepton one into a deeper level .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses can be well understood by the seesaw mechanism in a natural way .",
    "i seesaw mechanism @xcite provides the simplest possibility by extending the standard model ( sm ) with three right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos .",
    "an introduction of discrete symmetries into it may reveal the flavor structure of the neutrino and charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "for example , a type - i seesaw in conjugation with @xmath8 explains the tribimaximal lepton mixing pattern ( tbm ) @xcite in presence of sm singlet flavon ( charged under @xmath8 ) fields which get vacuum expectation values ( vev)@xcite",
    ". however the original approach fails to accommodate the recent observation of non - zero @xmath0@xcite . in @xcite , we have shown that an extension of the altarelli - feruglio ( af ) model @xcite by one additional flavon field can be employed to have a nonzero @xmath0 consistent with the present experimental results .",
    "the set - up also constraints the two majorana phases involved in the lepton mixing matrix .",
    "the deviation of the tbm pattern is achieved through a deformation of the rh neutrino mass matrix compared to the original one . on the other hand , within the framework of a general type - ii seesaw mechanism ( where both rh neutrinos and @xmath2 triplet higgs are present ) , light neutrino",
    "mass depends upon comparative magnitude of the pure type - i ( mediated by heavy rh neutrinos ) and triplet contributions .",
    "this interplay is well studied in the literature @xcite . in recent years keeping in mind that @xmath0 is nonzero , efforts have been given to realize leptogenesis @xcite and linking it with @xmath0 in models based on type - ii seesaw@xcite .",
    "in this article , we focus on the generation of light neutrino mass matrix through a type - ii seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "the fields content of the sm is extended with three right - handed neutrinos , one @xmath2 triplet and a set of sm singlet flavon fields . a flavor symmetry @xmath1 is considered .",
    "the type - ii seesaw mechanism therefore consists of the conventional type - i seesaw contribution ( @xmath9 ) along with the triplet contribution ( @xmath10 ) to the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "here we find the type - i contribution alone can generate the tbm mixing pattern , where the charged lepton mass matrix is a diagonal one .",
    "then we have shown that the same flavor symmetry allows us to have a deviation from the conventional type - i contribution , triggered by the @xmath2 triplet s vev .",
    "we have found that this deviation is sufficient enough to keep @xmath0 at an acceptable level@xcite .",
    "we mostly consider the triplet contribution to the light neutrino mass is subdominat compared to the conventional type - i contribution .",
    "we further assume that apart from the flavons ( sm singlets charged under @xmath8 ) involved , there is a @xmath8 singlet ( as well as sm gauge singlet ) field @xmath3 , which gets a complex vacuum expectation value and thereby responsible for spontaneous cp violation@xcite and other extensions of standard model @xcite .",
    "] at high scale @xcite .",
    "all other flavons have real vevs and all the couplings involved are considered to be real .",
    "it turns out that the magnitude of this complex vacuum expectation value of @xmath3 is responsible for the deviation of tbm by generating nonzero value of @xmath0 in the right ballpark . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase associated with it generates the dirac cp violating phase in the lepton sector .",
    "so in a way , the triplet contribution provides a unified source for cp violation and nonzero @xmath0 . in lepton sector , the other possibilities where cp violation can take place , involves complex vev of higgs triplets@xcite , or when a higgs bi - doublet ( particularly in left - right models ) gets complex vev@xcite or in a mixed situation @xcite .",
    "however , we will concentrate in a situation where a scalar singlet @xmath3 present in the theory gets complex vev as in @xcite .",
    "we have also studied the lepton asymmetry production through the decay of the heavy triplet involved .",
    "the decay of the triplet into two leptons contributes to the asymmetry where the virtual rh neutrinos are involved in the loop .",
    "this process is effective when the triplet is lighter than all the rh neutrinos .",
    "it turns out that sufficient lepton asymmetry can be generated in this way . on the other hand",
    "if the triplet mass is heavier than the rh neutrino masses , the lightest rh neutrino may be responsible for producing lepton asymmetry where the virtual triplet is contributing in the one loop diagram .    in @xcite",
    ", authors investigated a scenario where the triplet vevs are the sole contribution to the light neutrino mass and a single source of spontaneous cp violation was considered .",
    "there , it was shown that the low energy cp violating phase and the cp violation required for leptogenesis both are governed by the argument of the complex vev of that scalar field .",
    "the nonzero value of @xmath0 however followed from a perturbative deformation of the vev alignment of the flavons involved . here in our scenario , the tbm pattern is realized by the conventional type - i contribution .",
    "therefore in the tbm limit , @xmath0 is zero in our set - up .",
    "also there is no cp violating phase in this limit as all the flavons involved in @xmath9 are carrying real vevs , and hence no lepton asymmetry as well .",
    "now once the triplet contribution ( @xmath10 ) is switched on , not only the @xmath0 , but also the leptonic cp violation turn out to be nonzero . for generating lepton asymmetry ,",
    "two triplets were essential in @xcite , while we could explain the lepton asymmetry by a single triplet along with the presence of rh neutrinos .",
    "in this case , the rh neutrinos are heavier compared to the mass of the triplet involved .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we provide the status of the neutrino mixing and the mass squared differences .",
    "then in section [ sec3 ] , we describe the set - up of the model followed by constraining the parameter space of the framework from neutrino masses and mixing in section [ nucons ] . in section",
    "[ sec : lep ] , we describe how one can obtain lepton asymmetry out of this construction .",
    "finally we conclude in section [ conlc ] .",
    "here we summarize the neutrino mixing parameters and their present status .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix @xmath11 , in general , can be diagonalized by the @xmath12 matrix ( in the basis where charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal ) as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are the real mass eigenvalues for light neutrinos .",
    "the standard parametrization of the @xmath12 matrix @xcite is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , the angles @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19 $ ] is the cp - violating dirac phase while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the two cp - violating majorana phases .",
    "the mixing angles @xmath22 , @xmath23 and the two mass - squared differences @xmath24 have been well measured at several neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "recently the other mixing angle @xmath0 is also reported to be of sizable magnitude @xcite . very recently , we start to get hint for nonzero dirac cp phase@xcite . from the updated global analysis @xcite involving all the data from neutrino experiments , the 1@xmath25 and 3@xmath25 ranges of mixing angles and the mass - squared differences",
    "are mentioned ( nh and ih stand for the normal and inverted mass hierarchies respectively ) in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the result by planck@xcite from the analysis of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) also sets an upper limit on the sum of the three neutrino masses as given by , @xmath26 ev . the result from neutrinoless double beta decay by kamland - zen@xcite and exo-200 @xcite indicates a limit on the effective neutrino mass parameter @xmath27 as , @xmath28 ev at 90@xmath29 cl and @xmath30 ev at 90@xmath29 cl respectively .",
    "our starting point is the conventional type - i seesaw mechanism to explain the smallness of light neutrino masses which further predicts a tribimaximal mixing ( tbm ) pattern in the lepton sector . for this part",
    ", we use the original af model @xcite by introducing a discrete @xmath8 symmetry and @xmath8 triplet flavon fields @xmath31 along with a singlet @xmath32 field .",
    "of course three right handed neutrinos ( @xmath33 ) are also incorporated .",
    "in addition , we include a @xmath2 triplet field ( @xmath34 ) with hypercharge unity , the vev of which produces an additional contribution ( hereafter called the triplet contribution ) to the light neutrino mass .",
    "so our set - up basically involves a general type - ii seesaw , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the typical type - i term and @xmath10 is the triplet contribution . to realize both ,",
    "the relevant lagrangian for generation of @xmath11 can be written as , @xmath37 so that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the vevs of the triplet @xmath34 and sm higgs doublet ( @xmath42 ) respectively . @xmath43 and",
    "@xmath44 correspond to the yukawa matrices for the dirac mass and triplet terms respectively , the flavor structure of which are solely determined by the discrete symmetries imposed on the fields involved in the model .",
    "@xmath45 is the majorana mass of the rh neutrinos . in the following subsection",
    ", we discuss in detail how the flavor structure of @xmath46 and @xmath45 are generated with the flavon fields .",
    "a discrete symmetry @xmath47 is also present in our model and two other sm singlet fields @xmath48 and @xmath49 are introduced .",
    "these additional fields and the discrete symmetries considered play crucial role in realizing a typical structure of the triplet contribution to the light neutrino mass matrix as we will see below . among all these scalar fields present , only the @xmath3 field is assumed to have a complex vev while all other vevs are real .",
    "the framework is based on the sm gauge group extended with the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the field contents and charges under the symmetries imposed are provided in table [ teb2 ] .    with the above fields content ,",
    "the charged lepton lagrangian is described by , @xmath50 to the leading order , where @xmath51 is the cut - off scale of the theory and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the respective coupling constants .",
    "terms in the first parenthesis represent products of two @xmath8 triplets , which further contracts with @xmath8 singlets @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 corresponding to @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively to make a true singlet under @xmath8 .",
    "once the flavons @xmath59 and @xmath60 get the vevs along a suitable direction as @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively and @xmath60 are assumed here .",
    "we expect the minimization of the potential involving @xmath59 and @xmath60 can produce this by proper tuning of the parameters involved in the potential .",
    "however the very details of it are beyond the scope of this paper . ]",
    ", it leads to a diagonal mass matrix for charged leptons , once the higgs vev @xmath41 is inserted .",
    "below we will first summarize how the tbm mixing is achieved followed by the triplet contribution in the next subsection .",
    "the requirement of introducing sm singlet fields will be explained subsequently while discussing the flavor structure of neutrino mass matrix in detail .",
    "the relevant lagrangian for the type - i seesaw in the neutrino sector is given by , @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the coupling constants .",
    "after the @xmath66 and @xmath59 fields get vevs and the electroweak vev @xmath41 is included , it yields the following flavor structure for dirac ( @xmath67 ) and majorana ( @xmath68 ) mass matrices , @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath8 multiplication rules that results to this flavor structure can be found in @xcite .",
    "therefore the contribution toward light neutrino mass that results from the type - i seesaw mechanism is found to be , @xmath71 note that this form of @xmath9 indicates that the corresponding diagonalizing matrix would be nothing but the tbm mixing matrix of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath72    as a characteristic of typical @xmath8 generated structure , the rh neutrinos mass matrix is as well diagonalized by the @xmath73 . in order to achieve the real and positive mass eigenvalues ,",
    "the corresponding rotation @xmath74 is provided on @xmath45 as @xmath75 with @xmath76 once @xmath77 is considered . on the other hand for @xmath78 ; through @xmath79 itself , the real and positive eigenvalues of @xmath45 [ @xmath80 can be obtained .",
    "this would be useful when we will consider the decay of the rh neutrinos for leptogenesis in section [ sec : lep ] .",
    "the leading order lagrangian invariant under the symmetries imposed , that describes the triplet contribution to the light neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath10 ) , is given by , @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the couplings involved . here",
    "@xmath48 develops a vev @xmath84 and the singlet @xmath3 is having a complex vev @xmath85 . as we have mentioned before , the vev of @xmath3 provides the unique source of cp violation as all other vevs and couplings are assumed to be real .",
    "cp is therefore assumed to be conserved in all the terms involved in the lagrangian .",
    "similar to @xcite , cp is spontaneously broken by the complex vev of the @xmath3 field .",
    "after plugging all these vevs , the above lagrangian in eq.([ld ] ) contributes to the following yukawa matrix for the triplet @xmath34 as given by , @xmath86 this specific structure follows from the @xmath8 charge assignments of various fields present in eq.([ld ] ) and is instrumental in providing nonzero @xmath0 as we will see shortly .    before discussing the vev of the @xmath34 field ,",

    "similar to @xcite , here also it can be shown that the @xmath3 field gets a complex vev for a choice of parameters involved in @xmath92 as @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "however contrary to @xcite , here we have only a single triplet field @xmath34 .",
    "once the @xmath31 get vevs , the last term of @xmath95 results into an effective @xmath96 interaction which would be important for leptogenesis .",
    "the vev of the triplet @xmath34 is obtained by minimizing the relevant terms . ] from @xmath87 after plugging the vevs of the flavons and is given by @xmath97    using eqs.([ydelta ] ) and ( [ d1d2 ] ) , the triplet contribution to the light neutrino mass matrix follows from the lagrangian @xmath98 as @xmath99 where @xmath100 note that only the triplet contribution ( @xmath101 ) involves the phase due to the involvement of @xmath102 in @xmath103 , while the entire type - i contribution @xmath9 remains real .",
    "therefore the term @xmath101 serves as the unique source of generating all the cp - violating phases involved in neutrino as well as in lepton mixing .",
    "this will be clear once we discuss the neutrino mixing in the subsequent section .",

    "in this section , we discuss how the neutrino masses and mixing can be obtained from the @xmath11 mentioned above . keeping in mind that @xmath9 can be diagonalized by @xmath73",

    "we have , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 are the real and positive eigenvalues and @xmath113 are the phases associated to these mass eigenvalues .",

    "<S> a possible interplay between the two terms of the general type - ii seesaw formula is exercised which leads to the generation of nonzero @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the specific flavor structure of the model , guided by the @xmath1 symmetry and accompanied with the standard model singlet flavons , yields the conventional seesaw contribution to produce the tribimaximal lepton mixing which is further corrected by the presence of the @xmath2 triplet contribution to accommodate @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the cp symmetry to be spontaneously broken by the complex vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a singlet field @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> while the magnitude of its complex vev is responsible for generating @xmath0 , its phase part induces the low energy cp violating phase ( @xmath4 ) and the cp violation required for leptogenesis . hence the triplet contribution , although sub - dominant , plays crucial role in providing a common source for non - zero @xmath0 , @xmath4 and cp - violation required for leptogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the recent hint for @xmath4 close to @xmath5 is somewhat favored in this set - up though it excludes the exact equality with @xmath5 . </S>",
