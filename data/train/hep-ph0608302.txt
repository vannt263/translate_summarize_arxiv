    "experimental data at different collision energies would verify the solution and shed more light on the dynamics of the @xmath0 meson production . at present",

    "measurement at lower energies would be also interesting .",
    "natural possibilities would be fair at gsi and j - parc at tokai .",
    "such data could shed more light on the role of subleading reggeons which seems important in understanding the wa102 data .",
    "due to a nonlocality of the loop integral our model leads to sizeable deviations from the @xmath172 dependence ( predicted in the models of one - step fusion of two vector objects ) .",

    "<S> most of the models of ugdf from the literature give too small cross section as compared to the wa102 data and predict angular distribution in relative azimuthal angle strongly asymmetric with respect to @xmath8 in disagreement with the wa102 data . </S>",
    "<S> this points to a different mechanism at the wa102 energy . </S>",
    "<S> predictions for rhic , tevatron and lhc are given . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the normalization , @xmath9 dependences as well as deviations from @xmath7 of double - diffractive double - elastic cross section are extremely sensitive to the choice of ugdf . </S>",
    "<S> possible implications for ugdfs are discussed . </S>"
