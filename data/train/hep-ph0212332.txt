    "in quantum field theory and especially in the cosmological context , various models have been discussed where the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry produces domain walls @xcite . if the symmetry is approximate and broken spontaneously in the history of the expanding universe , the false vacuum regions shrink due to the energy density difference @xcite and this process is accelerated by the surface tension .",
    "the shrinking will stop before collapsing if there exist zero mode solutions for the fermions bound in such domain walls @xcite and the fermi pressure of such fermions becomes comparable to the shrinking force due to the surface tension and the volume energy .",
    "these objects , a kind of non - topological solitons , are called fermi balls @xcite and introduced as a candidate for cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "they were also suggested in the baryon - separation scenario with the qcd energy scale @xcite .",
    "however , the stability of the fermi balls which should be essential to be a candidate for cold dark matter has not been fully examined .",
    "we consider in this paper the stability of the thin - wall fermi balls against the fragmentation",
    ". the fermi ball , if it is electrically neutral as was firstly proposed @xcite , is unstable against the fragmentation , when the domain wall thickness @xmath3 can be neglected in comparison with the fermi ball radius @xmath4 . in the previous paper @xcite , we estimated the corrections caused by the finite @xmath3 effect ( corresponding to the curvature effect of the domain wall ) , and found that the neutral fermi ball is unstable even if the curvature effect is included .",
    "though the electrically charged fermi ball introduced by morris @xcite has the stability against the deformation from the spherical shape @xcite , they are metastable @xcite and not absolutely stable against the fragmentation",
    ". we do not discuss the charged fermi ball in the present paper .    in the above discussions ,",
    "though , the thickness @xmath5 of the distribution of the fermions confined in the wall is much less than the wall thickness @xmath3 and can be neglected .",
    "this approximation is valid only for the case where the fermions are tightly bound to the domain wall .",
    "we in this paper consider the case where @xmath5 can not be neglected . in order to estimate the corrections caused by the finite @xmath5 effect",
    ", we use the perturbation approximation expanding the scalar field @xmath6 , the fermion field @xmath7 and the static energy of the fermi ball @xmath8 in the power of @xmath9 .",
    "we examine the stability of the fermi ball against the fragmentation at each level of the perturbation .",
    "the contents of the present paper are organized as follows : we first explain the neutral fermi ball model to clarify terminologies and method of energy estimation in sec.[setup.sec ] .",
    "we next examine the stability of the fermi ball within the leading ( zeroth ) order of @xmath9-perturbation but with finite @xmath5 in sec.[1storder.sec ] , and regain the result obtained in the previous works in the limit @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the effect of the finite @xmath5 in the higher order corrections of @xmath9-perturbation is investigated in sec.[2ndorder.sec ] .",
    "we discuss constraints on the fermi ball parameters from the experimental viewpoint in sec.[para.sec ] .",
    "we summarize the obtained results in sec.[concl.sec ] .",
    "we consider the simple model with the lagrangian density , @xmath11 where the scalar potential @xmath12 is approximately double - well shaped , @xmath13 here , the first term has the @xmath0 symmetry under @xmath14 , and the second term violates the symmetry though it is assumed to be much smaller than the first one , @xmath15 . supposing @xmath16 , we call the region with @xmath17 and that with @xmath18 as the true vacuum and the false vacuum , respectively . in the following ,",
    "we neglect the second term except for the explicit discussion in sec.[concl.sec ] .",
