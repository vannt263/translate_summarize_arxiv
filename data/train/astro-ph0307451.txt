    "more recently , white et al . (",
    "2003 ) presented an additional high resolution spectrum of a quasar at @xmath10 ( fan et al .",
    "2003 ) which also appears to have an extended gunn - peterson trough .",
    "together , these results indicate that the universe was reionised only a short time earlier , implying a relatively late epoch for complete reionisation .",
    "results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite ( kogut et .",
    "al 2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) have challenged this scenario by suggesting that much of the igm was ionised earlier than inferred from the sdss quasars . in particular , the measured correlation between polarisation and temperature yields an electron optical depth to the cmb surface of last scattering of @xmath11 , corresponding to an instantaneous reionisation epoch @xmath12 .",
    "the uncertainty associated with this measurement depends on fitting all parameters concerned with the tt power spectrum and the te cross power spectrum . after a careful analysis ,",
    "kogut et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have reported a 68% confidence range of @xmath13 corresponding to an instantaneous reionisation epoch @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , if reionisation was completed around @xmath15 , as is suggested by the sdss quasars , the electron optical depth would be only @xmath16 .",
    "although the discrepancy is only at the @xmath17 level , it is timely to explore the connection between the two sets of observations .    in a previous paper ( sokasian et al .",
    "2003 ; hereafter paper i ) , we used a high resolution cosmological simulation in conjunction with a fast 3d radiative transfer code to study how stellar sources similar to those seen in local galaxies , i.e. population ii type , contributed to the reionisation history of the igm in the redshift interval @xmath18 .",
    "this work was similar to other related numerical studies ( e.g. , gnedin 2000 ; ciardi et al .",
    "2000 ; razoumov et al . 2002 ; ciardi et al .",
    "2003 ) except that source intensities were derived directly from intrinsic star formation rates computed in the underlying hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "in addition , the high mass resolution of the simulation allowed us to include sources down to @xmath19 m@xmath20 in a @xmath21 mpc comoving box , which proved to have a significant impact on the reionisation process .",
    "our results showed that the star - formation history inferred by springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) based on detailed hydrodynamic simulations and estimated analytically by hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) led to a relatively late reionisation epoch near @xmath22 for a plausible range of escape fractions .",
    "additionally , we generated synthetic spectra from a range of models with different escape fractions and showed that values in the range 10 - 20% led to good statistical agreement with observational constraints on the neutral fraction of hydrogen at @xmath23 derived from the @xmath9 sdss quasar of becker et al .",
    "however , the relatively late reionisation epoch predicted by these models can not account for the high electron scattering optical depth inferred from the wmap measurements .    in an effort to study how this difference could be reconciled , we employed heuristic models with an evolving ionising boosting factor and found that in order to simultaneously match the wmap and sdss constraints , one requires an @xmath24 model with a boosting factor that rises from unity at @xmath6 to @xmath25 near @xmath26 . in this picture ,",
    "large boosting factors mean that the stellar production rate of ionising photons is much higher than that which would be produced according to our model assumptions .",
    "one mechanism that would boost the production rate of ionising photons would be if the stellar imf evolved so that it became increasingly top - heavy at high redshift .",
    "while possible , this scenario would still result in an igm that is highly ionised at @xmath27 , a condition which may be inconsistent with the thermal history of the igm . more specifically , hui & haiman ( 2003 ; see also theuns et al .",
    "2002 ) have shown that as long as the universe is reionised before @xmath28 and remains ionised thereafter , the igm would reach an asymptotic thermal state which is too cold compared to the temperature inferred from ly@xmath8 forest observations at @xmath29 .",
    "this conclusion , however , relies on assumptions regarding the ionising spectrum .",
    "for example , if the ionising spectrum is harder than the typical quasar spectrum above the h i and he i ionisation thresholds , then order unity changes in the ionisation fraction of h i and he i are necessary in the range @xmath30 in order to sufficiently heat up the igm within the observation constraint at @xmath31 .",
    "however , if the spectrum is relatively soft ( more typical of population ii stars ) then this condition is avoided as long as he ii reionisation occurs relatively late near @xmath32 ( see , for example , sokasian et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "another difficulty with boosting the production rate of ionising photons , as emphasised by e.g. yoshida et al .",
    "( 2003a , e ) is that the imf would need to remain top heavy for many generations of high mass stars .",
    "these stars have typical lifetimes @xmath33 a few million years .",
    "however , the total elapsed time between @xmath34 and @xmath28 is more than a hundred times longer ; therefore , it would be necessary for massive star formation to proceed efficiently for more than 100 generations .",
    "studies by e.g. omukai ( 2000 ) , bromm et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and schneider et al .",
    "( 2002 ) indicate that very massive stars can form only if the metallicity of the gas lies below a critical threshold , @xmath35 .",
    "it appears problematic for the gas in star - forming halos to remain sufficiently chemically pristine for massive star formation to continue for over 100 stellar generations .",
    "the combined observational constraints summarised above suggest that the reionisation history of the universe was complex , perhaps having had multiple reionisation epochs .",
    "such a scenario has been considered by cen ( 2003b ) and wyithe & loeb ( 2003b ) who pointed out the possibility that the universe was first reionised by an early generation of massive , metal - free ( population iii ) stars , but that then much of the igm recombined once these stars were no longer able to form , and the universe was subsequently reionised a second time by the next generation of population ii stars . in hierarchical models of structure formation",
    ", these `` first ( metal - free ) stars '' are thought to form through molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath36 ) cooling in halos with masses larger than @xmath37 m@xmath20 at redshifts as high as @xmath38 , provided that the halos are dynamically cold and contain sufficiently larger numbers of hydrogen molecules ( yoshida et al .",
    "2003c ) .",
    "recent progress in simulating the formation of the very first objects in the universe ( abel et al .",
    "1998 ; bromm , coppi & larson 1999 ) has shown that the first luminous objects to form in cdm models are stars .",
    "in addition , because the first h ii regions are capable of driving out most of the gas from the halo , it is unlikely that massive seed black holes are able to accrete within a hubble time after they formed ( whalen , abel , & norman 2003 ) . the notion that these population iii stars played a role in cosmological reionisation in cold dark matter ( cdm ) models has been discussed widely ( e.g. , couchman & rees 1986 ; barkana & loeb 2001 ; mackey , bromm , & hernquist 2003 ; venkatesan , tumlinson & shull 2003 ; cen 2003a ; wyithe & loeb 2003a ; yoshida et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "simulations indicate that these stars which form in `` mini - halos '' should be massive @xmath39 m@xmath20 ( abel , bryan , & norman 2000 , 2002 ; bromm , coppi & larson 2002 ) .",
    "whereas abel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) predict one massive star per halo bromm et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggest that multiple stars can be produced in each dark matter halo .",
    "we discuss both scenarios in this paper .",
    "such population iii stars are efficient uv emitters because of their approximately constant effective surface temperatures near @xmath40 k with lifetimes of @xmath41 yr , independent of their mass ( e.g. bromm , kudritzki & loeb 2001 ; schaerer 2002 for recent discussions ) . in fact , these stars are capable of producing up to @xmath42 times more ionising photons per baryon compared to population ii stars with a salpeter imf .",
    "although the impressive yield of ionising photons from population iii stars appears promising in terms of a possible solution to the early reionisation epoch suggested by wmap , there are still many questions remaining as to whether enough of these first generation stars could have formed to cause cosmic reionisation . in general , semi",
    "- analytic modeling has been used to address these questions ( see , e.g. , wyithe & loeb 2003a , b ; cen 2003a , b ) ; however , the predictions of these models are often uncertain because of the relatively crude assumptions used to relate luminous objects to the dark matter halos which host them .",
    "for example , yoshida et al .",
    "( 2003c ) have shown that simple criteria based on only the mass or virial temperatures of halos can fail by an order of magnitude or more because of dynamical heating by mergers . additionally , the effects of feedback processes are very difficult to assess in semi - analytic models . the uv radiation in the lyman - werner ( lw ) band ( 11.26 - 13.6 ev ) from these massive stars can photo - dissociate the fragile h@xmath36 molecules which are responsible for their formation .",
    "this negative feedback can significantly limit population iii star formation and thereby substantially reduce the effective ionising flux in the early universe .",
    "conversely , it has been argued that feedback from x - rays can promote h@xmath36 production by boosting the free electron fraction in distant regions ( haiman , rees & loeb 1996 ; oh 2001 ) .",
    "efforts to explore feedback effects on cooling and collapsing gas have been pursued by many groups ( e.g. , dekel & rees 1987 ; haiman , rees , & loeb 1997 ; haiman , abel , & rees 2000 ) .",
    "however , these studies have primarily relied on semi - analytic methods which assume spherically symmetry and ignore details regarding formation dynamics and locations of halos in complex density fields .",
    "a more realistic analysis of the problem requires detailed numerical simulations capable of capturing the physics of early structure formation and related feedback effects .",
    "this was first attempted by machacek , bryan , & abel ( 2001 ; see also machacek , bryan , & abel 2003 ) who employed an eulerian adaptive mesh refinement simulation to investigate the quantitative effects of a background radiation field on the subsequent cooling and collapse of high - redshift pre - galactic clouds .",
    "ricotti et al .",
    "( 2002a , b ) followed up on the numerical approach by including radiative transfer effects and found that the formation of small halo objects is not significantly suppressed by the dissociating background .",
    "more recently , yoshida et al .

    "( 2003b ) coupled radiative transfer calculations to their analysis to investigate reionisation by an early generation of stars .",
    "more specifically , they identified plausible sites of star formation in their cosmological volume where they then placed massive stars with @xmath43 m@xmath20 under the usual `` one star per halo '' assumption .",
    "they ran the multi - source radiative transfer code described in paper i on a @xmath44 grid with the assumption that source lifetimes are 3 million years and that the escape fraction for ionising radiation from the halos is unity . to mimic the strong radiative feedback in h ii regions , they implemented a `` volume exclusion effect '' which disabled sources within already ionised regions .",
    "the results from their analysis indicated that in the standard @xmath1cdm cosmology , a sufficient number of population iii sources turn on to fully reionise the volume by @xmath45 . by merging the subsequent ionisation history from population ii sources ( adopted from paper i )",

    "the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum has been set to @xmath56 and we normalise the fluctuation amplitude by setting @xmath57 .",

    "( 2003c ) and yoshida et al .",
    "( 2003d ) , respectively .",
    "the particular simulation we use employs @xmath58 particles in a cosmological volume of 1 mpc on a side , corresponding to a mass resolution of 160 m@xmath20 and 1040 m@xmath20 for gas and dark matter particles , respectively .",
    "convergence tests using higher resolution simulations indicate that the mass resolution adopted here is sufficient to follow the cooling and collapse of primordial gas within low mass ( @xmath59m@xmath20 ) halos .",
    "owing to the relatively small size of our simulation box , the fundamental fluctuation mode starts to become non - linear at @xmath60 , forcing us to stop our analysis at this redshift .",
    "we discuss the limitations of such a small volume in the context of predicting cosmic reionisation in  4 .",
    "our approach for defining sources relies on identifying virialised halos which contain a reservoir of cold and dense gas that undergoes star formation .",
    "this requires first locating dark matter halos via a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with a linking parameter @xmath61 in units of mean particle separation , and discarding groups with fewer than 100 dark matter particles . for each fof group",
    ", we compute a virial radius @xmath62 defined as the radius of the sphere centered on the most bound particle of the group having an overdensity of 180 relative to the critical density . within this radius",
    "we then measure the mass of gas which is cold ( @xmath63 k ) and dense ( @xmath64 @xmath65 ) .",
    "the clouds of molecular gas in these reservoirs is expected to rapidly cool and exceed the characteristic jeans mass @xmath66 m@xmath20 for the typical temperature @xmath67 k and density @xmath68 @xmath65 of the condensed gas .",
    "the halos which contain these reservoirs of cold gas are therefore considered to be sites of active star formation and serve as potential locations for population iii sources . in the top panel of figure 1",
    "we show how cold gas accumulates in star - forming halos as a function of redshift . here , star - forming halos ( _ solid circles _ ) are plotted at each simulation snapshot ( separated in time by @xmath69 years ) and serve to illustrate how cold gas accumulates within individual halos over time . in the bottom panel of the same figure",
    "we show the total number of star forming halos as function of redshift in our simulation volume .",
    "it is important to point out that in carrying out our analysis , we construct a halo merger history and use it to carefully track the star - forming gas that is exchanged between the progenitors and descendants of each halo .    for each potential source site , we compute the amount of gas that actually forms stars by multiplying the total amount of cold gas in the halo by the free parameter @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath70 can be thought of as a universal star formation efficiency of _ dense - cold _ gas as defined above to form sources and should not be confused with similar definitions of star formation efficiencies based on the _ total _ amount of gas in the halo ( see , e.g. cen 2003a , b ) . in this study , we consider two different values for this parameter : @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . for a given value of @xmath70 , we apply a further restriction on the allowable mass of stars @xmath73 which can actually form . more specifically , we assume that the primordial imf is moderately top - heavy and yields stars with masses in the range 100 - 300 m@xmath20 .",
    "we therefore first discard all halos with star masses below @xmath74 m@xmath20 . above this limit",
    ", we allow a range of star masses to be incorporated into the halo up to a maximum of 900 m@xmath20 under the assumption that only a few stars can form at coincidentally close times and thus survive the intense dissociating radiation from the first star in the halo ( see omukai & nishi 1999 ; abel , bryan & norman 2002 ) and its subsequent explosion ( e.g. bromm et al . 2003 ) . our assumption may therefore be considered as a slightly more relaxed version of the `` one - star - per - halo '' prescription employed in related studies of this topic ( see , e.g. , oh , nollett , madau , wasserburg 2001 ) . nevertheless , it should be noted that the associated parameter space which will be explored in this study leads to relatively few multi - source halos ( @xmath75 m@xmath20 ) under the assumption of a moderately top - heavy imf and therefore leads to similar results .",
    "because of their high mass , population iii stars are dominated by radiation pressure and have luminosities close to the eddington limit @xmath76 .",
    "this leads to a constant source lifetime estimated to be @xmath77 yr .",
    "we use this value as the universal lifetime for all our stars and also adopt it as the time step over which we evolve our simulation . to compute ionising intensities we first note the results presented in bromm , kudritzki , & loeb ( 2001 ) who demonstrated that population iii stars with masses @xmath78 m@xmath20 have a generic mass - scaled spectral form that is almost independent of mass resulting in h i and he ii ionising photon production rates @xmath79 s@xmath55 m@xmath80 and @xmath81 s@xmath55 m@xmath80 , respectively . for 100 m@xmath20 stars ,",
    "the number of ionising photons per solar mass is reduced by a factor of @xmath82 for h i and @xmath83 for he ii ( bromm et al . 2001 ; tumlinson & shull 2000 ) . given our assumption of the 100 - 300 m@xmath20 mass range for individual stars , we compute ionisation rates for halos by interpolating between the values quoted above for the 100 m@xmath20 and @xmath78 m@xmath20 cases . in the relatively few halos where the total source mass exceeds 300 m@xmath20 , we adopt the median values of @xmath84 s@xmath55 m@xmath80 for h i and @xmath85 s@xmath55 m@xmath80 for he ii under the assumption that these halos contain multiple stars with masses in the range 100 - 300 m@xmath20 .",
    "the quantity of ionising flux that can actually escape a halo and enter into the igm is parameterised by the escape fraction @xmath86 . in this context , @xmath87 is defined to be the fraction of ionising photons intrinsic to each source that escape the virial radius of the halo and participate in the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "it must be noted here that this parameter inevitably also carries with it any uncertainties associated with the shape of the galaxy , the gas and stellar density profiles , and the imf and star formation efficiency . at low redshifts , observations deduced from @xmath88 starburst galaxies ( see heckman et al 2001 ; hurwitz et al .",
    "1997 ; leitherer 1995 ) suggest small values for @xmath87 around @xmath89 . however , it is important to note that these observational results may be underestimating the true values owing to undetected absorption from interstellar components .",
    "in fact , observations of 29 lyman break galaxies at @xmath90 by steidel , pettini , adelberger ( 2001 ) appear to suggest much larger escape fractions .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear how the relevant factors associated with the escape fraction vary with redshift",
    ". theoretical work on @xmath87 at high redshifts ( wood & loeb 2000 , ricotti & shull 2000 ) finds small values , although these estimates are highly uncertain owing to the lack of information regarding the imf and star formation efficiencies at early times . in addition , the effect of dust , complex gas inhomogeneity and gas dynamics , all of which may strongly influence escape fractions , are not included in these theoretical studies .",
    "more recently , whalen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have studied the ionisation environment of the first luminous objects using detailed one  dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations and find that the transition from d to r  type fronts occurs within only @xmath91yrs after the star reaches the zero age main sequence .",
    "because these i  fronts exit the halo on timescales much shorter that the stars main sequence lifetime , their host halos can have uv escape fractions of @xmath92 .",
    "given these recent results we employ relatively large escape fractions , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , in all the models we consider .",
    "the escape fraction of unity is motivated by the extreme cases from whalen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) while the escape fraction of 0.3 is meant to represent an alternate case where the surrounding environment is much more complex and restrictive to ionising break - throughs .",
    "feedback effects from the first stars inevitably exert prompt and significant impact on subsequent star formation .",
    "locally , population iii stars are expected to significantly affect their environments when they explode as supernovae ( e.g. bromm et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this `` internal '' feedback will perturb the gas and effectively regulate subsequent star formation in the pregalactic cloud .",
    "feedback from the first stars can also affect structure formation on a global scale .",
    "this is because the uv photons below 13.6 ev produced by these stars can easily propagate through the universe and build up a soft uv background that can alter the chemistry of distant regions .",
    "more specifically , studies have suggested that even a feeble uv background can photo - dissociate the fragile h@xmath36 molecules necessary for cooling of the primordial gas ( see , e.g. , haiman , rees , & loeb 1997 ; haiman , abel , rees 2000 ; ciardi , ferrara , & abel 2000 ; machacek , bryan , & abel 2001 ) .",
    "conversely , it has been argued that feedback may actually enhance h@xmath36 formation ahead of of the ionisation front ( ricotti , gnedin , & shull 2001 ) or through the boosting of the electron fraction in dense regions by x - rays emitted from , for example , distant supernovae remnants ( haiman , rees & loeb 1996 ; cen 2003a ; but see also machacek , bryan , & abel 2003 who find that the net effect of x - rays is rather mild ) .",
    "presently , the technical difficulties involved with the incorporation of radiative transfer calculations directly into cosmological simulations prevent us from studying these effects numerically in a fully consistent manner .",
    "we therefore adopt a more _ ad hoc _ approach which attempts to include feedback effects through the incorporation of simple , physically motivated criteria which dynamically constrain the amount of stellar mass that forms . in the following two sections we will describe our prescription for parameterising internal and external feedback effects within the context of our simulation .",
    "stars with masses in the range 140 m@xmath95 m@xmath20 are expected to die as supernovae which release up to @xmath96 ergs of kinetic energy into their surroundings ( e.g. heger & woosley 2002 ) .",
    "since the gravitational binding energy for gas in sub - galactic halos is @xmath97^{5/3 } [ ( 1+z)/20]$ ] , these explosions can severely disrupt their immediate surroundings , possibly _ driving away _ a large portion of the gas from the halo ( see , e.g. , bromm , yoshida , & hernquist 2003 ) . to mimic this effect",
    ", we introduce an `` internal disruption factor '' @xmath98 which will parameterise the amount of gas that gets blown out .",
    "more specifically , for every halo which turns on with star mass @xmath73 , we flag a corresponding amount of star forming gas mass @xmath99 ( cold gas ) equivalent to @xmath100 within that halo as unusable for future star formation .",
    "the prescription for calculating a new star mass for a given halo is then quantified at each time step @xmath101 in terms of @xmath70 by the expression , @xmath102,\\ ] ] where @xmath103 represents the amount of _ usable _ star - forming gas mass from the previous step and @xmath104 is the amount of new star - forming gas accumulating in the halo at the current step .",
    "this prescription requires us to explicitly track the history of gas in each halo directly , accounting for the accumulation of new star - forming gas by continuing accretion from surrounding gas , and also from mergers with other star - forming halos . in this analysis ,",
    "we explore a case where the disruption factor is small , @xmath105 , and also a case where the disruption factor is large , @xmath106 .",
    "we admit that these choices for the disruption factor are somewhat arbitrary .",
    "however , our aim here is to use @xmath98 in conjunction with @xmath70 to create a range of different models which span the plausible parameter space associated with internal feedback effects . in particular",
    ", our choice of @xmath105 will describe a scenario where clumps of condensed gas in the halo only inefficiently absorb the energy released from a local supernova ( possibly owing to a spatially clustered distribution with a small cross section and large column density to the explosion site ) and are therefore marginally disrupted ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "such a low disruption factor may also be motivated by the potential positive feedback which can arise from propagating compression shocks induced by the exploding star which may accelerate star formation within the halo ( mackey , bromm , & hernquist 2003 ; salvaterra , ferrara & schneider 2003 ) .",
    "on the other hand , our choice of @xmath106 will simulate the case where energy absorption is efficient and effectively disperses a large amount ( @xmath108 ) of the gas . here ,",
    "values for @xmath109 close to unity correspond to the total disruption of star - forming gas within the halo , while values larger than unity are meant to represent an extreme disruption of the gas extending beyond the halo .",
    "formally , the latter scenario results in negative star masses for some of the halos immediately after a star - forming episode . in these cases",
    "we simply set the star mass to zero , but continue to track the amount of _ negative _ star forming gas mass in the halo , which decreases in time as new gas is accumulated .",
    "negative star forming gas , in this context , represents a ramification of strong internal feedback effects which not only disrupt the available star forming gas in the halo but also inhibit the future accretion of neighbouring gas surrounding the halo . in all cases ,",
    "it is important to keep in mind that our parameterisation of the disruption factor @xmath98 also carries with it the uncertainty associated with whether or not the stars formed actually end their lives as supernovae .    in figure 2 , we plot all the possible star - forming halos in our simulation volume for the four different combinations of @xmath98 and @xmath70 we tried . here ,",
    "the two dotted horizontal lines delineate the range of allowable star masses in halos ( _ solid circles _ ) as described earlier . in particular , halos with source masses falling short of @xmath74 m@xmath20 ( _ crosses _ )",
    "are excluded while those above the @xmath110 m@xmath20 limit ( _ open - circles _ ) are included , but with star masses artificially set to the upper limit of @xmath110 m@xmath20 .",
    "a comparison between this figure and the top panel in figure 1 clearly demonstrates the effect of including a disruption mechanism in the halos .",
    "namely , once halos acquire enough star mass to turn on , the surrounding star forming mass in that halo is disrupted to varying degrees and does not monotonically increase as a function of time .",
    "consequently , a halo which has turned on at a given time may not have enough undisrupted star - forming gas at subsequent time steps to turn on again .",
    "this effect is especially noticeable in the right - hand column where the disruption factor is high with the most dramatic case indicated in the top - right panel . here",
    ", the combination with a high efficiency factor renders most halos incapable of turning on more than once . in the left - hand column ,",
    "the disruption factor is 3 times smaller and most halos are capable of turning on repeatedly .",
    "this is especially true in the bottom - left panel where the efficiency is also small and individual halos can be seen switching on continuously once they surpass the minimum star mass threshold .",
    "interestingly , in all cases the most massive halo in our simulation volume appears to contain enough star - forming mass at redshifts below 20 that the disruption caused by a star mass of 900 m@xmath20 switching on at each step does not inhibit subsequent star formation .",
    "this seems like a plausible scenario for halos with very deep potential wells that are especially conducive to star formation .",
    "it must be noted that at some level there exists a degeneracy between the effects produced by the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath70 .",
    "however , as figure 2 demonstrates , there are distinct differences between the two parameters in terms of simulating the physical consequences of star formation , especially in extreme cases .",
    "we therefore continue our analysis with this distinction .",
    "we now turn to the issue of simulating external feedback effects which have a more global impact . the first type of external feedback we consider is related to the `` sphere of influence '' associated with the ionisation zone surrounding a source .",
    "the gas within this region is expected to be substantially photo - heated to temperatures in excess of @xmath111 k when ionised by radiation with a spectrum typical of metal - free stars ( see hui & haiman 2003 ) . for example , a @xmath112 m@xmath20 halo at @xmath113 has a binding energy of roughly @xmath114 ergs , which is considerably less that the total ionising energy produced by a single massive star of order @xmath115  m@xmath116 erg . as a result",
    ", star - forming gas in shallow potential wells located within these ionised regions photo - evaporates and fails to produce stars .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is difficult to gauge without a self consistent treatment of radiative photo - heating effects linked directly to the hydrodynamics of the gas .",
    "since the radiative transfer and gas dynamics are not coupled in our calculations , we can only simulate the effect in an _ ad hoc _ manner .",
    "in particular , we would like to qualitatively mimic the inhibiting effects that photo - heating may have on star formation in halos as function of the depth of their potential wells , or masses , as seen in the simulations of e.g. bromm et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and whalen et al .",
    "for this , we implement an `` ionisation exclusion effect '' which will act to inhibit sources from turning on before a certain amount of time has passed since their gas was ionised .",
    "we express the recuperation time @xmath117 in terms of the free fall time associated with each source cell . in a spherical potential , the free fall time can be expressed as , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the gravitational constant and @xmath120 is the density .",
    "we note that free fall times are calculated only for the overdense cells which actually contain sources , otherwise this time scale is not meaningful . as a first order approximation",
    ", we use this expression to compute free fall times in source cells according to their matter densities .",
    "we can then express the recuperation time in terms of the free fall time @xmath121 . here",
    "the free parameter @xmath122 can be thought of as the relative fraction of a free fall time that must pass before a source halo can recuperate from the negative effects of photo - evaporation .",
    "this method requires us to carefully track when source cells become ionised ( either by their own radiation or by the radiation of neighbouring sources ) and subsequently increment the amount of time that passes in these cells at each time step .",
    "it should be noted that we also track the migration of sources into different source cells during the course of a particular exclusion interval so as to properly follow the total wait time associated with each source halo .",
    "owing to the large overdensities in source cells , recombination times are short and , as a result , it is possible for a given source cell to undergo multiple ionisations and inhibited phases . on a general level",
    ", this effect is very similar to the `` volume exclusion effect '' adopted by yoshida et al .",
    "( 2003b ) although our method has the convenient feature of naturally gauging the resiliency of each halo to be able to recuperate from photo - heating .",
    "to explore both a weak and strong case of this effect , we consider recuperation parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "next , we turn to photo - dissociation of molecular hydrogen by the lw radiation from the first stars . while photons with energies above 13.6 ev are likely to be completely absorbed by the gas surrounding the sources , those with energies in the lw bands can easily travel unimpeded through the neutral igm and build up a uniform uv background radiation field ( dekel & rees 1987 ; haiman , et al .",
    "2000 ; omukai & nishi 1999 ) .",
    "we emphasise that the net effect of this radiation is _ not _ to completely inhibit primordial gas cooling , but it raises the minimum mass scale of the halos in which the gas can cool ( haiman et al . 2000 ; machacek et al .",
    "recently , yoshida et al .",
    "( 2003c ) studied the effect of lw backgrounds on the formation of primordial gas clouds and found that owing to the photo - dissociation of h@xmath36 , gas cooling is suppressed for radiation with intensity @xmath125 ( in units of @xmath126 erg s@xmath55 @xmath127 hz@xmath55 str@xmath55 ) .",
    "they also implemented a technique to compute h@xmath36 column densities around virialised regions making it possible to estimate gas self - shielding factors in their maximal limits . with the help of self - shielding , primordial gas in large halos",
    "can cool efficiently even when exposed to background radiation with intensity @xmath128 .",
    "while the two extreme cases studied by yoshida et al .",
    "( 2003c ) , an optically thin limit and maximal gas self - shielding , should bracket the true effect of the lw background , a more careful study is required to obtain an accurate estimate of the impact of this radiation .",
    "given the uncertainties , we continue with our approach of adopting a simple parameterisation aimed at capturing the qualitative aspects of the effect . in particular",
    ", we first note that lw radiation is only capable of affecting the abundance of molecular hydrogen in gas and does not significantly affect the thermal state of the gas . assuming equilibrium , the amount of molecular hydrogen in a gas cloud is inversely proportional to the photo - dissociation reaction coefficient given by , @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the radiation intensity at @xmath131 ev and @xmath132 is the effective shielding factor . neglecting the evolution of the gas density and temperature , and noting",
    "that the cooling rate scales just as the number of hydrogen molecules , the amount of gas that can cool should be proportional to @xmath133 . given this linear scaling we introduce a modulating function , @xmath134 from which the amount of cold gas available for star mass production is computed after the effects of photo - dissociation are taken into account . to determine the fitting parameters @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , we refer to yoshida et al .",
    "( 2003c ) who point out that lw radiation is unimportant for @xmath138 , whereas for @xmath139 , the gas can not cool by molecular hydrogen cooling in nearly all the halos in the optically thin limit ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "thus by setting @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and restricting the maximum value of @xmath144 to 1 , we are able to mimic this behaviour .",
    "the fact that the relevant range of intensities is small lends support for our use of a linear approximation .    assuming that an effective screen owing to abundant neutral hydrogen blocks photons in the lyman - series lines from all sources at redshifts above @xmath145 ( haiman et al .",
    "1997 ) , we can approximate @xmath146 at each redshift @xmath147 by summing the emissivity in the lw band from all previously active sources up to @xmath145 . for our analysis",
    ", we set @xmath148 and approximate @xmath149 as arising from the unattenuated radiation field purely from the set of sources in the previous time step . our assumption should be reasonable given the large amount of neutral hydrogen present around the time when @xmath130 becomes appreciable and the fact that photons with @xmath150 ev will be redshifted out of the relevant energy range ( 11.18 - 13.6ev ) after @xmath151 change in redshift .",
    "since the luminosity in the lw band per unit stellar mass for very massive stars is @xmath152 erg s@xmath55 hz@xmath55 m@xmath80 , with only a weak dependence on the stellar mass , our expression for @xmath153 becomes , @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the speed of light , @xmath156 is the total star mass which was switched on at redshift step @xmath157 , @xmath158 is our time step of @xmath159 yr , and @xmath160 is the proper volume of our simulation box at @xmath147 .",
    "owing to the highly uncertain nature of shielding processes , we refrain from developing a complex parameterisation of this effect ( see , however ,  7.2 of yoshida",
    "rather , we adopt the conservative value of @xmath161 as our maximum shielding effectiveness for halos with @xmath162 m@xmath163 and linearly scale this value with mass such that @xmath164 for @xmath165 m@xmath20 ( corresponding to zero shielding ) .",
    "we apply this level of shielding in all our models .    finally , we turn to the effect of metal pollution from the life - cycles of the first stars .",
    "metals can cool gas inside halos to temperatures lower than can be achieved by h@xmath36 cooling , making possible the formation of less massive _ ordinary _ population ii stars .",
    "the critical transition between the two populations should occur after a certain level of metal enrichment has occurred .",
    "assuming that the metallicity in the igm is directly linked to the amount of gas that has been incorporated into population iii stars , one can parameterise when this transition should occur in terms of the fraction of total gas that forms massive stars .",
    "oh et al . (",
    "2001 ) estimate that the critical transition should occur when a fraction of @xmath166 is formed into massive stars in the range 150 - 250 m@xmath20 , which are believed to be the main contributors of metals .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this estimate assumes that metals produced by massive stars are uniformly mixed throughout the igm , which is unlikely .",
    "if this is not the case , and metals remain preferentially near sites of halo formation , then we would expect that the critical fraction is potentially much lower than the value reported by oh et al .",
    "in addition , stars with masses larger than 250 m@xmath20 were excluded under the assumption that their contribution to metal enrichment should be small if they end their lives as black holes .",
    "however , the amount of mass these stars shed before they collapse into black holes is still relatively uncertain and may also reduce the fraction quoted above .    given the large uncertainty associated with this fraction",
    ", we allow all our models to continually form population iii stars all the way to @xmath167 where we stop our simulations owing to the growing non - linearity of the fundamental fluctuation mode . for all the models which we consider , the fraction of total gas mass that is converted to stars @xmath168 by @xmath167 falls short of the lower bound of the critical range quoted by oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in an effort to study more protracted population iii epochs",
    ", we will employ simple extrapolations of the model results to lower redshifts .",
    "this will allow us to assess the impact of population iii stars for larger @xmath168 values more consistent with the critical range quoted in oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "our goal of identifying the important features which are associated with the ability of population iii stars to reionise the universe leaves us with a rather large parameter space to explore .",
    "namely , even neglecting uncertainties associated with the lw background and metal enrichment , we are still left with 4 free parameters : @xmath87 , @xmath70 , @xmath169 , and @xmath122 .",
    "our approach of considering both a weak and strong case for each of these parameters thus leads to 16 separate models which we list in table 1 .",
    "in addition , we include a further model m9 which will represent our most restrictive case where we allow only a single 200 m@xmath20 star to form in each halo which has at least @xmath170 m@xmath20 of star forming mass ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "this model is meant to be more consistent with the picture described by abel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who have used high resolution hydrodynamical simulations to show that a pre - galactic halo tends to form only a single collapsing core in its center without renewed fragmentation . in an effort to simulate the ultimate inhibition of subsequent star formation in these halos",
    ", we further restrict the model to allow only one episode of population iii star - formation per halo without the possibility of forming new metal - free in the same halo or its descendents at a later time . in this case , once a single source turns on within the halo or its gas becomes ionised by a neighbouring source , we inhibit it from hosting any future metal - free stars ( @xmath171 , @xmath172 ) . it is important to point out that the total number of ionising photons released by a single 200 m@xmath20 star in the course of @xmath173 yrs easily exceeds the amount of baryons in even our most massive halos and therefore justifies our use of relatively large escape fractions in single - star halos ( see whalen et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the main goal of our analysis will be to explore the effectiveness of population iii stars as ionising sources in the early universe . by considering a plausible set of models which incorporate feedback effects to varying degrees",
    ", we develop a better qualitative understanding of the complex interplay between these processes and reionisation .",
    "our inclusion of an _ ultra - restrictive _ model will allow us to loosely constrain the minimum effectiveness of population iii reionisation .",
    "the reionisation history of h i and he ii is followed in each of our models using the radiative transfer code described in paper i. briefly , radiative transfer is performed on a cartesian grid with @xmath44 cells using an adaptive ray - casting scheme ( abel & wandelt 2002 ) .",
    "density fields , clumping factors , and source characteristics are taken from outputs of the hydrodynamic simulations ; thus we neglect the dynamical feedback of the radiation on structure formation .",
    "however , to account for the neglected photo - heating of the igm , we compute recombinations in our radiative transfer calculations according to an artificially raised temperature of @xmath174 k. this temperature corresponds to a reasonable estimate of the igm temperature after reionisation by sources with spectra typical of metal - free sources ( hui & haiman 2003 )",
    ". if the photoionised gas has a higher temperature , recombinations occur at a slightly slower rate ( the recombination time @xmath175 ) and ionisation zones grow marginally faster . for lower temperatures ,",
    "the opposite is true .    in the context of reionisation studies ,",
    "cosmic variance limits our ability to capture both a representative mass function for source halos and also a reliable picture of the distribution of gas in the universe .",
    "since our simulation box has a comoving length of only 1 mpc , we will not be able to make very strong statements regarding the precise moment of cosmic reionisation .",
    "however , as stated earlier , our goal is only to assess the relative properties of a set of physically motivated models for the impact population iii sources can have on reionisation .",
    "having stated this , we note that the same small box simulation was analysed in yoshida et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and was found to contain halo abundances for @xmath176 m@xmath20 that were in reasonable agreement with the press - schechter mass function between @xmath177 ( see also jang - condell & hernquist 2001 ) .",
    "the incomplete sampling of the halo mass function due to the finite box size is appreciable only at @xmath178 .",
    "however , as we shall show , star formation in our models is not dominated by rare massive halos and therefore simulating larger volumes should not significantly alter our results .      in figure 3",
    ", we show the evolution of the star formation rate ( sfr ) density for population iii stars for all our models . here",
    "the sfr is computed on the fly as the simulation regulates the amount of star mass that actually turns on after incorporating the effects of feedback . by @xmath167 , all but",
    "our most restrictive model m9 appear to reach a sfr near @xmath179 m@xmath20 yr@xmath55 mpc@xmath180 .",
    "the similarity in the sfrs between the different models brings attention to the self - regulating consequences of feedback .",
    "for example , when the disruption factor is large , less star formation takes place locally , which in turn minimises negative feedback in the form of dissociating radiation and photo - evaporation . as a result ,",
    "star formation is promoted externally and the global sfr is regulated . in a similar fashion ,",
    "models with a low escape fraction limit the effect of photo - evaporation externally and therefore are able to have a similar level of star formation as models with a large escape fraction . in ",
    "4.3 we shall take a more detailed look at dynamic feedback and attempt to quantify the effect .    nevertheless , it is important to point out that a sfr of @xmath179 m@xmath20 yr@xmath55 mpc@xmath180 is roughly an order of magnitude lower than the `` normal - mode '' ( population ii ) star formation predictions from springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) and hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) at the same redshift . here , `` normal mode '' refers to star formation occurring in larger mass systems where gas cooling takes place via atomic hydrogen and helium transitions and the only form of regulating feedback is supernovae . besides the difference in amplitude , the sfr in our population iii models appears to have relatively `` flatter '' shapes in the range @xmath181 compared to the `` normal - mode '' sfr of hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) .",
    "this is not surprising given the stronger regulating processes associated with population iii star formation .",
    "the overall shape and the amplitude of the sfr are in reasonable agreement with the semi - analytic prediction of yoshida et al .",
    "( 2003c , their fig .",
    "it is important to note that population iii star formation at @xmath182 may have a significant impact on subsequent `` normal - mode '' star formation occurring in small proto - galaxies which are susceptible to the negative feedback effects of photoheating .",
    "because these effects were not included , it is not surprising that the population iii sfr presented here does not converge with the `` normal - mode '' sfr of hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) .",
    "nevertheless , if the epoch of population iii stars ends abruptly , as we have assumed here , then the transition itself should also be abrupt . a very interesting issue for future work , therefore , would be to address how the transition from population iii stars to ordinary star formation occurs .",
    "the discontinuity presented here represents an additional uncertainty of our analysis only when we attempt to compute a complete history of reionisation which spans both population ii and population iii stars .",
    "the evolution of the global ionisation fraction in the simulation volume is a useful tool for characterising differences between the various models . in figures 4 and 5",
    "we show the evolution of the volume - weighted ionisation fraction down to @xmath167 for h ii and he iii , respectively . in each panel , we plot both the @xmath183 ( _ solid - line _ ) and @xmath94 ( _ dashed - line _ ) cases for the corresponding model . here",
    ", we note that with the exception of our most restrictive model m9 , all the @xmath184 models are able to significantly ionise their volumes by @xmath167 .",
    "interestingly , some of the models with higher emissivity are also able to substantially doubly ionise helium although the corresponding fractions are much less than in h ii . this is true despite the fact that the ionising spectrum of a typical @xmath185 m@xmath20 metal - free star produces roughly @xmath186 times more ionising photons per helium atom compared to hydrogen for cosmic abundances .",
    "the difference in the resultant ionisation fractions owes to the fact that the recombination rate of he iii is much larger relative to h ii .",
    "this large recombination rate is also responsible for making he iii ionisation evolution relatively less smooth , because relic he iii regions are much quicker to recombine .    in all our models ,",
    "the initial rise of the ionisation fraction appears to be closely correlated with the exponential growth of star - forming halos in the volume .",
    "interestingly , however , our highest emissivity models ( m1@xmath187 , m2@xmath187 , m3@xmath187 ) appear to show some degree of divergence from this rate at later times . in particular , the rise of the ionisation fraction becomes shallower once the ionisation fraction exceeds @xmath188 .",
    "the mostly likely explanation for this behaviour is that dynamic external feedback becomes particularly inhibitive once a substantial portion of the volume has become ionised and many sources become involved in the process .",
    "we will explore this effect in more detail in the next section where we try to assess the impact from this dynamic component of the feedback in terms of the amount of star mass that actually turns on at each time step .",
    "a summary of the ionisation results at @xmath167 is given in table 2 which lists for each model : the fraction of total gas mass converted to stars @xmath168 , the cumulative number of ionising photons released per atom , and the volume ionisation fraction for h ii and he iii , respectively .",
    "here we point out that while our more restrictive models do not achieve as high of an ionisation fraction as the models with larger emissivities by @xmath167 , they convert less gas mass into stars and therefore should have polluted their environment relatively less with metals . as a result , we would expect that metal - free star formation should persist longer in these models .",
    "it is particularly interesting to compare the results for our most restrictive model m9 to our most liberal model m1 .",
    "we note in particular that the realisation of a `` one - star - per - halo '' for metal - free stars as defined in our m9 model has such a slow rate of growth for its ionising emissivity that recombinations will likely prevent the ionisation fraction from increasing significantly even if we had extended this model down to lower redshifts .",
    "however , we point out that this model is relatively more efficient in terms of the resultant ionisation fraction per ionising photon than the m1 model with larger emissivity .",
    "this feature can be attributed to the fact that models with higher emissivity suffer cumulatively more recombinations as a result of ionising substantial portions of their volumes at very early redshifts and keeping them ionised down to lower redshifts .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this difference will be slightly diminished by the fact that ionisation fronts in the more restrictive m9 model have difficulty breaking through the dense environments surrounding the sources .",
    "this causes the m9 model to suffer relatively more recombinations _ per unit volume _ than models with higher emissivity whose ionisation zones expand into the less dense and more voluminous portions of the igm .",
    "this morphological effect also helps to explain why models m4-m9 , which have not yet experienced a slow - down in the rate of ionising photon production ( owing to external feedback factors ) , exhibit ionisation fractions for their @xmath94 case that are systematically lower than @xmath189 times the ionisation fractions predicted in the corresponding @xmath184 case ( see table 2 ) .",
    "a visual illustration of the reionisation process is shown in figure 6 where we plot a series of projected slices through the simulation volume from the m1@xmath190 model ( other models exhibit a similar topological evolution in their ionisation structures ) . in each panel , a @xmath191 mpc slice is projected in both density and ionisation fraction . from the plots one can follow the growth of the ionisation zones ( _ blue _ ) around the first stars as they turn neutral gas ( _ yellow _ ) into highly ionised regions ( _ light - blue _ ) .",
    "the plots clearly show the preferential advance of ionisation fronts into the underdense regions , responsible for the steep rise seen in the corresponding volume - weighted ionisation fractions .",
    "to understand which halos are contributing the bulk of the ionising radiation , we plot in figure 7 the fraction of ionising flux released as function of halo mass for three redshift ranges associated with the m1@xmath192 run ( other models had similar results ) . here",
    "we see that through the redshift ranges @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 , the bulk of ionising radiation is consistently released from halos with masses between @xmath196 m@xmath20 and @xmath197 m@xmath20 .",
    "the fact that these `` mini - halos '' are capable of substantially ionising the igm appears to contrast with the findings of ricotti et al .",
    "( 2002a ) who conducted similar 3d cosmological simulations which included dynamically linked radiative transfer calculations ( see ricotti et al .",
    "2002b for simulation details ) .",
    "they showed that negative feedback prevents the size of h ii regions from exceeding the size of the dense filaments ; hence , `` mini - halos '' are not able to reionise the voids . more specifically , the ricotti et al .",
    "( 2002a ) simulations showed that positive feedback from the accelerated formation rate of molecular hydrogen in front of ionisation fronts within these filaments provided an effective shield preventing the destruction of molecular hydrogen in other star forming regions . on the contrary , when the ionisation fronts expand beyond the filaments , densities drop and the shield disappears allowing negative feedback from lw radiation and photoevaporation to dominate .",
    "ricotti et al .",
    "( 2002a ) thus concluded that the volume filling factor of the h ii regions associated with these `` mini - halos '' remains small and can not reionise the universe .",
    "although none of the models considered in our analysis are able to fully reionise the universe before the onset of population ii stars , they do ionise a substantial portion of the igm .",
    "this discrepancy most likely results from the way in which negative feedback is treated in the simulations .",
    "more specifically , by dynamically linking approximate radiative transfer calculations directly with cosmological simulations , ricotti et al .",
    "( 2002a ) are able to simulate positive feedback processes preceding h ii regions which effectively reduces negative feedback from the dissociation of molecular hydrogen . however ,",
    "when the ionising emissivity of `` mini - halos '' is large , ionisation fronts expand outside of the filaments and negative feedback from dissociation and photo - heating begins to dominate .",
    "since our analysis does not allow us to couple radiative transfer effects directly into the cosmological simulations , we are unable to include positive feedback effects such as the one mentioned above . nevertheless , the models we consider are able to easily force ionisation fronts beyond the dense filaments and therefore we do not expect positive feedback to be important in these cases .",
    "once ionisation fronts expand into the igm , negative feedback effects kick in through our _ ad - hoc _ implementation of the photo - evaporation effect and the lw dissociating background . as we shall show in the following section , such feedback works to regulate further star formation , however , unlike ricotti et al .",
    "( 2002a ) we do not find that it fully suppresses star formation .",
    "it is important to note that our simulations included an approximate treatment which allowed halos to shield themselves against dissociating radiation in proportion to their masses .",
    "in contrast , self - shielding was excluded in the simulations of ricotti et al .",
    "( 2002a ) and may have resulted in an overestimation of negative feedback , plausibly causing much of our discrepancy with the results by ricotti et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "furthermore , it should be pointed out that the discrepancy may also be related to a number of other differences between the two simulations such as the differing methodologies used in the calculation of the star forming mass in the halos as well as differences in the choice of the imf .      in figures 4 and 5",
    "we showed the evolution of the global volume - weighted ionisation fraction for each model . while useful for making comparisons between the net ionising ability of the models",

    "we attempt to study the effectiveness and subsequent evolution of this feedback more directly .",
    "in particular , we focus on tracking the modulating behaviour of our implementation of the lw background and the photo - evaporation effect ( or in terms of our parameterisation , the `` ionisation exclusion effect '' ) . more specifically , by tracking the ratio of the star mass that actually turns on at each time step @xmath198 to the star mass originally available @xmath199 ( computed in the absence on any external feedback )",
    ", we can directly study the net impact from both these effects .",
    "in figure 8 we show the ratio @xmath200 at each redshift step as a histogram for all our models .",
    "the plots reveal sharp swings mainly owing to the discrete timesteps used . however , these swings are enhanced at early times , reflecting the strong nature of our `` ionisation exclusion effect '' when localised to a small region with only a few sources , which is the case when the first cluster of sources turns on .",
    "as more sources are invoked at lower redshifts , this ratio begins to behave more smoothly .    in table 3",
    "we list for all the models the mean value of @xmath201 weighted by the original star mass between the time the first source turns on and @xmath167 .",
    "this mass - weighted mean quantifies the relative effectiveness of external dynamical feedback .",
    "note , in particular , how models in which we have incorporated strong local feedback effects have correspondingly low values for this mean ratio ( compare , for example , models m1@xmath202m2 and m3@xmath202m4 ) .",
    "this is a clear indication of the self - regulating feature of the population iii era : when local negative feedback is strong , the global component of negative feedback is reduced , allowing for more sources to turn on in distant regions .",
    "this feature helps to explain how such a large set of model realisations leads to the relatively similar ionisation histories seen in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "bearing in mind that the net effect of the lw background is to systematically reduce @xmath200 in proportion to the star mass that froms , one can use the mean of this ratio to isolate and assess the relative impact of the photo - evaporation effect between the models m1@xmath202m5 , m2@xmath202m6 , m3@xmath202m7 , and m4@xmath202m8 .",
    "note in particular , the significant drop in this ratio from m1@xmath203m5 , which gives an indication that external feedback may play an important role in scenarios where star formation is efficient and internal feedback is low .",
    "interestingly , the effectiveness of external feedback is strong by @xmath204 even in model m9 which turns on very few sources .",
    "this is most likely owing to the fact that these sources reside in only the most clustered regions containing massive enough halos capable of hosting sources in this _ ultra - restrictive _ model .",
    "the close proximity of the sources to one another in these regions therefore keeps external feedback in the form of photo - evaporation particularly effective in inhibiting a fair portion of the sources from turning on .",
    "we mention that , under certain conditions , weak ionising radiation can promote molecular hydrogen formation and enhance primordial gas cooling , hence causing possibly _ positive _ feedback effects ( haiman , rees , & loeb 1996 ; kitayama et al .",
    "we do not consider the effects in our models and thus all the models may be restrictive in this sense .",
    "the recent tentative measurement of polarisation in the cmb by the wmap satellite ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) indicates that reionisation occurred earlier than implied by the sdss quasars alone ( e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "the optical depth to thomson scattering is @xmath13 corresponding to an instantaneous reionisation epoch between @xmath205 . in paper",
    "i , we showed that stellar sources similar to those seen in local galaxies ; i.e. population ii type stars , are unable to reionise the universe by such high redshifts .",
    "meanwhile , the analysis in this paper indicates that metal - free ( population iii ) stars could have significantly reionised the universe at @xmath206 .",
    "cen ( 2003a , b ) and wyithe & loeb ( 2003a , b ) explored a large number of models of reionisation history using semi - analytic methods and argue that , in some specific cases , the universe could be reionised twice .    in an effort to study this scenario more quantitatively , we would like to couple the ionisation histories from both types of sources and compute the resulting integrated electron optical depth . unfortunately , owing to the high resolution necessary for carrying out simulations involving population iii stars , we are unable to directly include these sources in the larger simulation volumes necessary for studying cosmic reionisation by population ii sources ( galaxies ) .",
    "we are therefore forced to adopt the more approximate approach of linking together the ionisation histories from the two sets of simulation volumes .",
    "more specifically , our approach relies on using the results of our population iii simulations to estimate the volume - weighted ionisation fraction at redshifts around which it is reasonable to assume that star - forming halos have exhausted their ability to form additional metal - free stars . at this point in time , we then re - run the @xmath24 population ii simulation from paper i ( conducted in a 14.3 mpc comoving box ) with the initial conditions that the igm was _ uniformly _ ionised to the same ionisation fraction ( both in hydrogen and helium ) as estimated by our population iii simulations and also _ uniformly _ heated to @xmath174 k. our use of this particular model for population ii sources is motivated by our analysis in paper i where we found that given the amplitude and form of the underlying star formation predictions , an escape fraction near 20% is most successful in terms of statistically matching observational results from the @xmath9 sdss quasar of becker et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( see paper i for further details ) . by linking together the two simulations in this fashion",
    ", we are assuming that the onset of population ii begins exclusively at redshifts below the transition redshift and that there are no population iii stars thereafter . since the relative contribution predicted for population ii sources in the simulations is small above the transition redshifts which we will consider , we can reliably separate the two contributions in this manner .",
    "given the fact that most of our population iii models ionise the volume to a similar extent by @xmath167 , we are motivated to simplify our analysis by grouping together these models into a single model by averaging all the results at each redshift .",
    "we perform this averaging for models m1-m8 , but continue to keep model m9 distinct as it represents our _ ultra - restrictive _ case which predicts significantly lower ionisation fractions as a result of invoking only a single 200 m@xmath20 star once per star forming halo . by @xmath167 , at which point we stop our population iii simulations , our combined model m1-m8 with @xmath207 ( @xmath93 ) has converted a fraction @xmath208 ( @xmath209 ) of its total gas into stars .",
    "this fraction falls short of the lower limit estimated by oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the transition to the population ii epoch ( @xmath210 ) . in an effort to examine a more prolonged population iii epoch culminating with gas - to - star conversion fractions more in - line with the estimates from oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we apply a simple extrapolation of all the simulation results to redshifts below @xmath167 .",
    "more specifically , we extrapolate the simulations using the associated rate of change in the models between @xmath34 and @xmath167 . for the combined m1-m8 model with @xmath207 ( @xmath93 ) , we extrapolate the population iii epoch down to @xmath211 and @xmath212 resulting in gas conversion fractions : @xmath213 ( @xmath214 ) and @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) , respectively . in the case of model m9 with @xmath207 ( @xmath93 ) ,",
    "even an extrapolation down to @xmath217 only yields a conversion fraction of @xmath218 ( @xmath219 ) , well below the estimate from oh et al .",
    "however at @xmath220 , population ii stars which form via atomic line cooling in massive halos begin to dominate the ionising emissivity relative to the population iii stars incorporated in m9 .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath217 as our epoch transition redshift for this model keeping in mind that the exclusion of population iii sources below @xmath217 slightly underestimates the resultant rise in the global ionisation fraction .    in figure 9 and 10 , we plot the evolution of the h ii volume - weighted ionisation fraction ( _ top - panel _ ) and the corresponding optical depth to thomson scattering @xmath221 between the present and redshift @xmath222 ( _ bottom - panel _ ) for the models discussed above with @xmath94 and @xmath183 , respectively . here",
    "the vertical dashed - dotted line represents the redshift ( @xmath167 ) where we stop our population iii simulations .",
    "the meaning of the various curves is summarised in the caption to figure 9 .",
    "the electron optical depth was calculated from @xmath223 where @xmath224 @xmath225 is the thomson cross section and @xmath226 is the mean electron number density at @xmath227 . in the calculation of",
    "@xmath221 we use mass - weighted ionisation fractions and assume that helium is singly ionised to the same degree as the hydrogen component for @xmath228 and doubly ionised everywhere at @xmath88 .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates how population iii sources may have significantly contributed to the electron optical depth , especially in the case where the escape fraction from the mini - halos hosting metal - free stars is close to unity .",
    "interestingly , the relatively late onset of population iii stars does not cause a dramatic recombination era before population ii stars begin to continue the reionisation process .",
    "comparisons with the wmap results show that only the combined model with @xmath183 comes close to the inferred mean value of @xmath11 ( _ dashed - line _ ) with optical depths @xmath229 and @xmath230 for population iii extrapolations to @xmath211 and @xmath217 , respectively . in the case of our _ ultra - conservative _ m9 model with @xmath183 ,",
    "the resultant optical depth is @xmath231 larger than in the case with only population ii stars only , but is slightly shy of the lower @xmath232 limit of the wmap measurement . in all cases",
    ", however , it appears that a large escape fraction is required during the population iii epoch in order to significantly contribute to the integrated optical depth .",
    "in this paper we have applied approximate radiative transfer calculations to the results of cosmological simulations capable of following early structure formation in an effort to study the potential impact that the first generation of metal - free stars may have had on the reionisation history of the universe . by incorporating a series of approximate feedback effects ,",
    "we are able to simulate the complex interrelated processes which may have self - regulated subsequent population iii star formation .",
    "we have examined a set of models in which the severity of the effects was varied in order to capture qualitatively how the feedback can affect star - formation at early epochs .",
    "overall , we find that for a plausible range of values related to our parameterisations , population iii star formation proceeds in a self - regulated manner . as a result ,",
    "the net impact of these sources in terms of reionisation is fairly insensitive to the relative degree of severity of one form of feedback over another .",
    "this is true as long internal feedback within a halo is not exceedingly large and halos can host multiple generations of population iii stars . in particular",
    ", we find that if we restrict halos of sufficient mass to host only a single @xmath233 m@xmath20 star _ once _ in their existence , then the impact of population iii sources on reionisation is significantly reduced .    in the models where there is no restriction on the number of stars a halo can host and the escape fraction is unity , the mean level of ionisation reached by @xmath167 is @xmath234 and @xmath235 for h ii and he iii , respectively .",
    "one would therefore expect that at least within the context of this description , population iii stars should have had a significant impact on the ionisation history of the universe .",
    "interestingly , the fact that the helium component may also have been ionised to a significant fraction has consequences for the thermal history of the igm ( e.g. hui & haiman 2003 ) and could possibly be observable with future observations of he ii recombination lines in the host halos using the next generation space telescope ( oh , haiman , & rees 2001 ; tumlinson , giroux , & shull 2001 ) .    by linking together the simulation results of the population ii study from paper i with the results of the population iii analysis presented here , we are able to synthesise a full history of how the universe may have been reionised .",
    "we find that even with fairly conservative estimates for negative feedback , population iii sources with large escape fractions are able to significantly raise the total electron optical depth so that it becomes statistically consistent ( within the 1@xmath236 lower bound ) with the wmap measurement .",
    "we note that the thomson optical depths predicted in our analysis appear to be lower than those obtained in the semi - analytic treatment conducted by cen ( 2003a ) .",
    "correspondingly , population iii sources in our analysis appear to significantly affect the reionisation history of the universe only at relatively later times ( @xmath237 ) than the models considered by cen ( 2003a ) . nevertheless , both studies appear to suggest that achieving @xmath238 seems quite difficult with reasonable assumptions for the properties of population iii stars .",
    "it is impractical to make more direct comparisons between the two works given the very different approaches employed and the large number of parameters .",
    "it should also be noted that semi - analytic treatments do no allow for the direct incorporation of negative feedback effects and instead absorb these uncertainties directly into star formation efficiency factors . as a result",
    ", they may oversimplify the true impact of these effects if the amount of star mass that turns on in each halo is a sensitive function of halo properties such as proximity to other halos , merger history , and total mass ( yoshida et al .",
    "2003c ) .",
    "in carrying out our analysis , we were forced to extrapolate a small portion of the population iii ionisation history to lower redshifts owing to boxsize limitations . in doing so",
    ", we were able to produce gas - to - star conversion fractions which approached the critical range described in oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , estimated to mark the transition to the population ii epoch .",
    "it is important to point out that the simple recipe of oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) may not accurately reflect the transitional stage if metal pollution is not efficient .",
    "in particular , in the case of an inefficient mixing mechanism , the metallicity in overdense regions can almost reach solar levels even at @xmath206 for a top heavy imf , preemptively ending the population iii epoch ( e.g. yoshida et al .",
    "nevertheless , in all of our models we switched over to a population ii epoch at aggressively conservative values below or slightly above the lower bound of the estimated range in oh et al .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that population iii star formation continues beyond the transitional redshifts considered here .",
    "if that is the case , population iii stars would continue to significantly ionise the igm , potentially leading to a single reionisation epoch in which population ii sources turn on at relatively late times and are intense enough to keep the igm in a highly ionised state .",
    "in fact , our combined @xmath239 population iii model , when extrapolated down to @xmath217 , exhibits such a single reionisation epoch .",
    "interestingly , the results from this model appear very similar to the prediction from our model in paper i which incorporated an evolving ionising boosting factor as an additional multiplicative factor to the intrinsic ionisation rates in population ii sources .",
    "such an evolution would be indicative of an evolving imf which became more and more top - heavy with increasing redshift .",
    "we note however , that such a `` vanilla '' model of reionisation may be inconsistent with the observational constraints from the thermal history of the igm as noted earlier .",
    "future observations of cmb polarisation by the planck surveyor , potentially tractable observations of the 21 cm emission signal from neutral hydrogen at high redshifts ( see furlanetto et al . 2003 ; ciardi & madau 2003 ; zaldarriaga et al .",
    "2003 ) , and searches for ly-@xmath8 emission from galaxies at the reionisation epoch ( e.g. barton et al .",
    "2003 ) may help resolve these degeneracies .    through our analysis , we have attempted to assess the potential role feedback effects may have had on the ability of population iii sources to reionise the universe .",
    "while our radiative transfer simulations capture nearly all the important physical mechanisms operating during reionisation , the precise effects of some processes that are modeled in an _ ad hoc _ manner remain still uncertain .",
    "more accurate studies may soon be forthcoming with the incorporation of radiative transfer calculations directly into cosmological simulations similar to the one used here .    finally , we emphasise that the results here were obtained for a conventional @xmath1cdm cosmology . if the true power spectrum is actually similar to the running spectral index ( rsi ) model advocated by spergel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , `` first star formation '' in mini - halos will be greatly suppressed ( yoshida et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "it is an open question whether the first luminous sources at redshifts below @xmath240 in a rsi cosmology can produce a thomson optical depth consistent with the wmap measurement .",
