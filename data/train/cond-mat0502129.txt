    "the idea of quantum annealing ( qa ) is a late offspring of the celebrated _ simulated thermal annealing _ by kirkpatrick _",
    "et al . _ @xcite . in simulated annealing",
    ", the problem of minimizing a certain cost ( or energy ) function in a large configuration space is tackled by the introduction of a fictitious temperature , which is slowly lowered in the course of a monte carlo or molecular dynamics simulation @xcite .",
    "this device allows an exploration of the configuration space of the problem at hand , effectively avoiding trapping at unfavorable local minima through thermal hopping above energy barriers .",
    "it makes for a very robust and effective minimization tool , often much more effective than standard , gradient - based , minimization methods .",
    "an elegant and fascinating alternative to such a classical simulated annealing ( ca ) consists in helping the system escape the local minima through _ quantum mechanics _",
    ", by tunneling through the barriers rather than thermally overcoming them @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence in disordered ising ferromagnets subject to transverse magnetic fields showed that this strategy is not only feasible but presumably winning in certain cases @xcite .",
    "in essence , in quantum annealing one supplements the classical energy function , let us denote it by @xmath0 , with a suitable _ time - dependent _ quantum kinetic term , @xmath1 , which is initially very large , for @xmath2 , then gradually reduced to zero in a time @xmath3 .",
    "the quantum state of the system @xmath4 , initially prepared in the fully quantum ground state @xmath5 of @xmath6 , evolves according to the scrdinger equation @xmath7 |\\psi(t)\\rangle \\;,\\ ] ] to reach a final state @xmath8 .",
    "a crucial basic question is then how the residual energy @xmath9 , decreases for increasing @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the absolute minimum of @xmath0 , and @xmath11 is the average energy attained by the system after evolving for a time @xmath3 , @xmath12 , generally speaking , this question has to do with the _ adiabaticity _ of the quantum evolution , i.e. , whether the system is able , for sufficiently slow annealing ( sufficiently long @xmath3 ) , to follow the instantaneous ground state of @xmath13 , for a judiciously chosen @xmath1 .",
    "the fictitious kinetic energy @xmath1 can be chosen quite freely , with the only requirement of being reasonably easy to implement .",
    "for this reason , this approach has also been called quantum adiabatic evolution @xcite .    at the level of practical implementations on an ordinary ( classical ) computer , the task of following the time - dependent schrdinger evolution in eq .",
    "[ schrodinger : eqn ] is clearly feasible only for toy models with a sufficiently manageable hilbert space @xcite .",
    "actual optimization problems of practical interest usually involve astronomically large hilbert spaces , a fact that calls for alternative stochastic ( quantum monte carlo ) approaches .",
    "these qmc techniques , in turn , are usually suitable to using _ imaginary time _ quantum evolution , where the @xmath14 in eq .",
    "[ schrodinger : eqn ] is replaced by @xmath15 .",
    "one of the questions we will try to address in the present paper will be , therefore , if working with an imaginary - time schrdinger evolution changes the quantum adiabatic evolution approach in any essential way .",
    "we will argue that , as far as annealing is concerned , imaginary - time is essentially equivalent to real - time , and , as a matter of fact , can be quantitatively better .",
    "alternatively , a number of recent theoretical papers have applied path - integral monte carlo strategies to qa .",
    "a certain success has been obtained in several optimization problems , such as the folding of off - lattice polymer models @xcite , the random ising model ground state problem @xcite , and the traveling salesman problem @xcite .",
    "it is fair to say , however , that there is no general theory predicting the performance of a qa algorithm , in particular correlating it with the energy landscape of the given optimization problem .",
    "this is a quite unpleasant situation , in view of the fact that it is a - priori not obvious or guaranteed that a qa approach should do better than , for instance , ca .",
    "indeed , for the interesting case of boolean satisfiability problems  more precisely , a prototypical np - complete problem such as 3-sat  recent attempts in our group showed that path - integral monte carlo annealing may perform definitely _ worse _ than simple ca @xcite .",
    "evidently , the performance of qa over ca depends in detail on the energy landscape of the problem at hand , in particular on the nature and type of barriers separating the different local minima , a problem about which very little is known in many practical interesting cases @xcite .",
    "it makes sense therefore to move one step back and concentrate attention on the simplest textbook problems where the energy landscape is well under control : essentially , one - dimensional potentials , starting from a double well potential , the simplest form of barrier . on these well controlled landscapes we can carry out a detailed and exhaustive comparison between quantum adiabatic schrdinger evolution , both in real and in imaginary time , and its classical deterministic counterpart , i.e. , fokker - planck evolution .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "assume generally a situation in which a steepest - descent approach , i.e. , the strategy of following the gradient of @xmath20 , would lead to trapping into one of the many local minima of @xmath20 , and would thus not work .",
    "classically , as an obvious generalization of a steepest - descent approach , one could imagine of performing a stochastic ( markov ) dynamics in x - space according to a langevin equation @xmath21 where the strength of the noise term @xmath22 is controlled by the squared correlations @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "both @xmath25 and @xmath26  with dimensions of a diffusion constant and of a friction coefficient and related , respectively , to fluctuations and dissipation in the system  are temperature dependent quantities which can be chosen , for the present optimization purpose , with a certain freedom .",

    "classical annealing can in principle be performed through this langevin dynamics , by slowly decreasing the temperature @xmath31 as a function of time , from some initially large value @xmath32 down to zero . instead of working with the langevin equation  a stochastic differential equation  one might equivalently address the problem by studying the probability density @xmath33 of finding a particle at position @xmath17 at time @xmath34 .",

    "( [ gen_airy : eqn ] ) is easily solved when the annealing schedule for @xmath52 is linear , @xmath374 , i.e. , when @xmath375 with @xmath127 , a case in which eq .",
    "( [ gen_airy : eqn ] ) is of the _ airy _ type . in the latter case , it is useful to perform a final change of independent variable to @xmath376 , so that , defining @xmath377 , we can write the equation for @xmath378 in the standard airy form : @xmath379 the general solution of eq .  ( [ airy : eqn ] )",
    "is given in terms of the two airy s functions @xmath380 and @xmath381 , @xmath382 where @xmath383 and @xmath145 are two constant coefficients .",
    "going back to @xmath371 and @xmath369 , we then have the explicit expressions :    @xmath384    where the prime indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath385 , and we have used the property of airy s functions that @xmath386 and @xmath387 . finally , substituting back the expressions in eq .",
    "( [ solution_y : eqn ] ) into the original function @xmath88 , see eq .",
    "[ b_versus_y : eqn ] , we get :    @xmath388    this general solution correctly depends on one parameter only , i.e. , @xmath389 , so that we can put @xmath390 without loss of generality .",
    "we impose the initial condition @xmath359 by requiring : @xmath391 solving for @xmath145 , we get : @xmath392 due to the asymptotic properties of the airy s functions ( @xmath393 , @xmath394 and @xmath395 , @xmath396 , when @xmath397 on the real axis ) , we conclude that for the it case : @xmath398 so that , finally ,    @xmath399    where we used that @xmath400 and @xmath401 . on the other hand , for the rt case we have to take the limit @xmath402 ( on the real axis ) instead , and in that region all the airy s functions oscillate",
    ". nevertheless is possible to show that the value of @xmath145 is uniformly bounded for @xmath403 .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that for large @xmath3 and with a linear annealing schedule , @xmath127 , @xmath404 and , consequently , the residual energy behaves asymptotically as @xmath405 the generalization of this result to an arbitrary annealing exponent @xmath406 in @xmath407 , is a bit more involved .",
    "it is however possible to establish a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eps_res_airy : eqn ] ) , for arbitrary @xmath100 , that we checked by means of direct numerical integration .",
    "it reads : @xmath408 an expression that holds true for both rt and it annealing .",
    "a side issue , but nonetheless an interesting one we wish to discuss here relates to classical annealing , and concerns the well - known mapping of a fokker - planck equation onto an imaginary - time schrdinger problem @xcite , and its implications on the relationship between ca and qa .",
    "the bottom - line will be that the mapping does _ not _ imply that a fp - based ca is actually equivalent to qa , and moreover that such a mapping is not particularly useful in our annealing context .",
    "consider , once again , the fp problem with a time - dependent temperature @xmath31 @xmath409 where both the friction coefficient and the diffusion constant are now time - dependent quantities , which we indicate by @xmath410 and @xmath44 . in order to map the problem in eq .",
    "[ fp_2:eqn ] onto an imaginary - time schrdinger problem , the standard procedure @xcite is to pose @xmath411 and to determine @xmath412 in such a way as to eliminate the non - schrdinger - looking drift term , turning it onto a standard potential term .",
    "the algebra is trivial .",

    ", one can show that the resulting equation for @xmath85 is indeed of the schrdinger form @xmath418 with an effective potential @xmath419 given by @xmath420 + \\frac{\\partial_t \\phi_0(x , t)}{\\phi_0(x , t ) } \\;.\\ ] ] the first term in @xmath419 is the standard effective potential of the riccati form obtained in the time - independent case @xcite .",
    "the second piece in @xmath419 is absent in the time - independent case , and can be easily seen to be @xcite : @xmath421 the main point we want to stress is that , by annealing @xmath31 and hence @xmath263 , we not only reduce the coefficient of the laplacian in eq .",
    "[ fp_to_it : eqn ] , but we also strongly modify the _ potential _",
    "@xmath419 , at variance with a genuine qa where only the kinetic term is annealed down .",
    "the modifications of the potential are so strong that , at low temperature , the instantaneous eigenvalue spectrum associated to the fp equation , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ tls : sec ] , is vastly different from that of the quantum double well system .",
    "it is easy to see , by direct substitution in eq .",
    "( [ fp : eqn ] ) , that , at constant @xmath28 , the boltzmann distribution @xmath182 is a stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation only if @xmath422 and @xmath43 satisfy the einstein s relation , @xmath423 .",
    "if , for instance , @xmath63 behaves in one scheme as a power - law , @xmath424 , and in another as a slowly decreasing logarithm , @xmath425 , then the first scheme will be sooner or later more convenient independently of most details .",
    "typically , we restrict the variable @xmath17 in the interval @xmath426 $ ] , beyond which the potential is too large and @xmath33 is negligible , and use a grid of up to 1000 points , checking for convergence of the results .",
    "this is generally speaking a difficult fit : the estimated value of @xmath427 is between 0.14 and 0.22 , depending on the inclusion of sub - leading corrections , to be compared with the theoretical value of 0.22 . neglecting the log - corrections leads to a wrong estimate of the power - law exponent .        for the sake of precision , we should stress the fact that the logarithm is , strictly speaking , born out of the continuum limit , which is indeed valid only for @xmath428 .",
    "if the lattice constant @xmath106 is kept finite , there is a minimum non - zero value @xmath155 for the splitting between the bottom of any two valleys , and , based on the two - level system results , we could anticipate a final power - law behavior @xmath429 .",
    "nevertheless , the logarithmic behavior should apply in a whole temperature window with a final crossover to the power - law behavior ."
