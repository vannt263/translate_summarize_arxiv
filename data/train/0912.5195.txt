    "moist thermal convection combines turbulent convection with phase changes and latent heat release .",
    "it is ubiquitous throughout the atmosphere of the earth ( heintzenberg & charlson 2009 ) .",
    "when a parcel of air rises in convective motion , it expands adiabatically . as a consequence ,",
    "its temperature and pressure drop and at some point during its ascent the air parcel becomes saturated .",
    "once water condenses , a cloud is formed .",
    "the range of spatial and temporal scales in the convective turbulent motion varies widely , from a few hundred meters in isolated cumulus clouds to several thousands of kilometers in midlatitudes storm systems .    despite its enormous importance",
    ", the small - scale structure and statistics of moist convective turbulence has been studied relatively little compared to its dry convection counterpart .",
    "the reason for this gap is that turbulent convection in moist air includes the complex nonlinear thermodynamics of phase changes in addition to the turbulent motion ( stevens 2005 ; pauluis 2008 ) .",
    "the associated latent heat release provides a rapidly changing local source of buoyant motion , so that moist convection is characterized by a complex interaction between dynamics and thermodynamics .",
    "one approach to this problem is to express the buoyancy of a parcel of moist air as function of its entropy , pressure and total water content . in such framework ,",
    "phase changes can be treated implicitly , and lead to discontinuities of the partial derivatives in the equation of state at the saturation point ( emanuel 1994 ) . while moist convection remains poorly understood ,",
    "significant progress has been made in the last decade in understanding the global and local mechanisms of turbulent heat transfer in dry convection ( for a comprehensive review see ahlers _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) . in this work",
    ", we aim at transferring some of the numerical analysis concepts from the well - investigated dry convection case , such as studies of the rayleigh number dependence of the heat transfer ( verzicco & camussi 2003 ) , the flow properties in the cell ( van reeuwijk _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 ) or the small - scale statistics ( emran & schumacher 2008 ) to the less - explored moist convection case .",
    "we propose here to take a first step by considering moist convection in the idealized setting of moist rayleigh - bnard convection with a linearized thermodynamics of phase changes ( pauluis & schumacher 2010 ) . on the one hand ,",
    "the model is a straightforward extension of numerical studies in dry rayleigh - bnard convection in the boussinesq approximation ( e.g. schumacher 2009 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is a generalization of a moist convection model which was discussed by bretherton ( 1987 , 1988 ) for the linear and weakly nonlinear regime and has not been studied ever since . here",
    ", we conduct direct numerical simulations of the turbulent nonlinear stage of moist convection .",
    "the present work reports systematic parameter investigations to understand the effect of phase change on the turbulent transport of buoyancy through the shallow layer .",
    "we also discuss the dependence of the cloud cover on the physical parameters of the model .",
    "the buoyancy @xmath0 in atmospheric convection is given by ( emanuel 1994 ) @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the gravity acceleration , @xmath3 a mean density , @xmath4 the pressure , @xmath5 the entropy and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 the mixing ratios of water vapor , liquid water and ice . in the following , we discuss in brief the sequence of simplifications of the equation of state that result in a model of shallow non - precipitating moist convection in the boussinesq approximation  the simplest case that goes beyond the well - known dry convection ( pauluis & schumacher 2010 ) .",
    "first , in the boussinesq approximation the pressure variations about a mean hydrostatic profile are omitted when computing the buoyancy ( pauluis 2008 ) and one is left with @xmath9 .",
    "second , warm clouds are discussed with @xmath10 .",
    "third , we assume that the air parcels are in local thermodynamic equilibrium , which means that water vapor and condensed water can only co - exist at saturation line .",
    "this implies that liquid water is formed whenever a relative humidity of 100% is exceeded .",
    "furthermore , no rain can fall out in our model .",
    "the two remaining mixing ratios are then combined to the total water mixing ratio , @xmath11 .",
    "this assumption also excludes the possibility of supersaturation .",
    "condensation in the earth s atmosphere occurs primarily through heterogenous nucleation caused by a large number of cloud condensation nuclei ( @xmath12 m@xmath13 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "supersaturation rarely exceeds one per cent ( rogers & yau , 1989 ) . in the absence of condensation nuclei in the fluid",
    ", homogeneous condensation may result in much larger supersaturation , as in a recent experiment by zhong et al .",
    "( 2009 ) where the condensate is formed at the top plate of the convection cell .",
    "the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium has the practical advantage that , once the entropy and pressure are known , the total water content can be separated between the vapor and liquid phases .",
    "the dependencies of the buoyancy are thus reduced to @xmath14 .",
    "the buoyancy is still a highly nonlinear function of the entropy , total water mixing ratio and height .",
    "fourth , we approximate @xmath0 as a piecewise linear function of the two state variables @xmath5 , @xmath15 at each height @xmath16 around the phase boundary between gas and liquid .",
    "the linearization step restricts us to a shallow layer since the height variations of thermodynamic quantities have to remain small .",
    "it preserves the main physical ingredient : the discontinuity of partial derivatives ( e.g. the specific heat ) at the phase boundary .",
    "it also allows for an explicit determination of whether an air parcel is saturated or not .",
    "finally , since @xmath0 is a linear function of @xmath5 and @xmath15 , we can introduce two new prognostic buoyancy fields , a _ dry buoyancy field _",
    "@xmath17 ( which corresponds to a liquid water potential temperature ) and a _ moist buoyancy field _ @xmath18 ( which corresponds to an equivalent potential temperature ) .",
    "they are linear combinations of @xmath5 and @xmath15 . since the state variables @xmath5 and @xmath15 are adiabatic invariants , the two new state variables @xmath18 and @xmath17 are also conserved by adiabatic transformations .",
    "consequently , the original buoyancy @xmath19 is simplified to @xmath20 , a linear function of the fields @xmath18 and @xmath17 which is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the brunt - vaisala frequency .",
    "this is the saturation condition in our model .",
    "the dry and moist buoyancy fields can be decomposed in @xmath23 the variations about the mean linear profiles of both fields have to vanish at @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "equation ( [ buo1 ] ) can now be transformed into @xmath26 note that the first term on the right - hand side is horizontally uniform .",
    "this implies that it can be balanced by a horizontally uniform pressure field given by @xmath27 z^2 $ ] .",
    "we can thus remove the mean contribution from the buoyancy field without any loss of generality . a dimensionless version of the equations of motion",
    "is obtained by defining the characteristic quantities .",
    "these are the height of the layer @xmath25 , the free - fall velocity @xmath28 , the time @xmath29 , the characteristic pressure @xmath30 , and the buoyancy difference @xmath31 .",
    "the equations together with the decompositions ( [ decomposition a ] ) and ( [ decomposition b ] ) are given by @xmath32 these equations contain three non - dimensional parameters , the prandtl number @xmath33 , the dry and the moist rayleigh numbers @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath36 under most circumstances , the amount of water in the atmosphere decreases with height .",
    "this implies that the moist rayleigh number should be larger than the dry rayleigh number , @xmath37 .",
    "in addition to the three parameters explicitly present in equations ( [ ueq])-([meq ] ) , two more parameters are hidden implicitly within the definition ( [ buo2 ] ) of the buoyancy @xmath0 which is given in dimensionless form by @xmath38 the so - called _ surface saturation deficit _ @xmath39 and the _ condensation in saturated ascent _",
    "@xmath40 are then defined as @xmath41 these two new non - dimensional parameters respectively measure how close the lower boundary is to saturation , and how much water can condense within the atmospheric layer during an adiabatic ascent of a saturated air parcel .",
    "the larger @xmath40 , the easier is the formation of liquid water and thus of clouds .",
    "when @xmath42 is positive , the air at the lower boundary is unsaturated , and @xmath42 is proportional to the `` water deficit '' , i.e. the amount of water vapor that must be added to the air parcel to become saturated .",
    "a positive surface saturation deficit @xmath39 would occur over the continents .",
    "for convection over the ocean , the lower boundary is neither saturated nor unsaturated , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "it is clear that we can consider a subspace of the five - dimensional parameter space only which is spanned in general by @xmath44 and @xmath40 . therefore , this study is restricted to @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the variation of @xmath39 while keeping the other parameters fixed was discussed already in pauluis & schumacher ( 2010 ) .",
    "the equations of motion are solved by a pseudospectral scheme with volumetric fast fourier transformations and 2/3 de - aliasing in a cartesian slab with side lengths @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 is the aspect ratio of the slab . in lateral directions @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we apply periodic boundary conditions . in the vertical @xmath16 direction",
    ", we apply free - slip boundary conditions , @xmath51 the boundary conditions , which have also been used in bretherton ( 1987 , 1988 ) , approximate a situation over an ocean surface at the bottom and a temperature inversion at the top .",
    "time - stepping is done by a second - order runge - kutta scheme . since both buoyancy fields are linearly unstable , the requirements on mesh resolution and time stepping are the same as in dry convection . the additional scalar field and the update of the @xmath0 increases computational costs by 20% .",
    "table 1 summarizes the grid resolutions and dimensionless parameter sets which are taken in the direct numerical simulations",
    ". the spectral resolution does not go below @xmath52 for all dns , where @xmath53 is the maximum resolved wavenumber and @xmath54 the kolmogorov length . technically , we use @xmath55 in the momentum equation ( [ ueq ] ) instead of @xmath0 since the mean contribution is @xmath56 which can be added to the kinematic pressure , i.e. @xmath57 . for the moist runs we distinguish two classes for initial equilibrium configurations  a fully saturated slab which corresponds with @xmath58 ( large csa ) and a fully unsaturated slab with @xmath59 ( small csa ) .    .parameters of simulation runs : grid resolution , @xmath35 , @xmath34 and @xmath40 . for all runs , @xmath45 , @xmath60 and @xmath46",

    "this is when the statistical analysis is started .",
    "as indicated in the table , we restrict dependencies of moist convection on the two rayleigh numbers and parameter @xmath40 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the mean vertical profile of the buoyancy , @xmath84 , which is obtained by taking averages in the @xmath16 planes and over an ensemble of statistically independent snapshots .",
    "it is observed , that this profile becomes strongly asymmetric for the cases which started with an initially fully saturated equilibrium .",
    "these will be the cases where phase changes affect the turbulence properties most strongly .",
    "table 1 lists the root - mean - square ( rms ) values of @xmath18 and @xmath85 as obtained in the statistically stationary regime .",
    "since both buoyancy fields follow a linear advection - diffusion equation , the ratio of the rms fluctuations to the outer buoyancy difference @xmath31 should be constant .",
    "the velocity rms fluctuations decrease with decreasing @xmath40 . at fixed @xmath40 , the fluctuations decrease also with increasing rayleigh number @xmath34 .",
    "this result is also observed in dry convection ( verzicco & camussi 2003 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we refine this analysis and study the vertical profile of the rms of the vertical velocity component , @xmath86 .",
    "a measure of asymmetry of the profile with respect to the midplane @xmath87 can be based on the moments @xmath88 .",
    "if the skewness @xmath71 is larger than zero then the vertical velocity fluctuations are enhanced in the upper half of the slab .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) shows that the profile is symmetric for the dry reference run and those with smaller amount of water which can be condensed . asymmetry is observed for @xmath89 which peaks at @xmath81 and decreases again for larger @xmath40 .",
    "we will show at the end of subsection 3.2 that the asymmetry in the vertical velocity fluctuations is directly coupled to the vertical fraction @xmath73 of the convection layer that is partially saturated and unsaturated .",
    "this fraction turns out to be largest at @xmath81 for all @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "it is also found that isotropy in the velocity fluctuations is established to a better degree with increasing @xmath34 .",
    "we conclude that phase changes cause the asymmetry of the vertical velocity fluctuations",
    ". however , with increasing rayleigh number and thus reynolds number the small - scale turbulence is found at increasingly isotropic conditions which can compensate this trend in parts .    of central importance in dry convection",
    "is the one - point - correlation between buoyancy ( or temperature ) and vertical velocity , @xmath78 ( which is equal to @xmath90 ) .",
    "it enters the definition of the dimensionless measure of buoyancy flux through the layer , the nusselt number @xmath91 . in the present model",
    ", we can define two nusselt numbers for both fields in a standard way , such as @xmath92/ [ \\kappa(d_0-d_h)/h]$ ] for @xmath17 which is constant and thus simply denoted by @xmath93 . since @xmath93 and @xmath94 are normalized with respect to their diffusive fluxes , @xmath95 follows which was verified in the simulations . in order to quantify the additional amount of buoyancy transfer",
    ", we will relate the correlations @xmath78 to the dry field in the following .",
    "note that the buoyancy flux @xmath96 is tied to the correlations @xmath97 and @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , because the partial derivative of the buoyancy with respect to @xmath18 and @xmath17 are bound by 0 and 1 ( see ( [ buo1 ] ) ) , we have automatically that at each level @xmath16 @xmath98 the lower bound ( @xmath99 ) occurs when a layer is fully unsaturated , while the upper bound ( @xmath100 ) is achieved in fully saturated layer .",

    "the formation of clouds is less probable when @xmath34 is increased .",
    "reasons could be the stronger filamentation of the turbulent patches and the decreased velocity fluctuations which are in line with an increase of the reynolds number of the turbulent flow . for @xmath116 and 0.44",

    "we have presented a shallow moist convection model with a linear equation of state for the thermodynamics of phase changes . this model which contains five dimensionless parameters",
    "is discussed in a three - dimensional subspace due to fixed prandtl number and surface saturation deficit ( @xmath39 ) . the most important simplification which reduces the complexity is the assumption of a local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "several key physical processes , such as the formation of precipitation and the existence of supersaturation are thus omitted .",
    "the model nevertheless captures the fundamental interactions between phase transition and dynamics .",
    "phase changes cause an asymmetry of the vertical velocity fluctuations when the amount of water that can be condensed ( parameter @xmath40 ) is sufficiently large .",
    "similar to the dry convection case , the correlations between vertical velocity and buoyancy are used to quantify the amount of additional buoyancy flux due to condensation and related latent heat release .",
    "furthermore , this correlation can be connected with the cloud cover in the layer .    the studies in this simplified setting provide thus a basis for possible parameterizations of cloud impact in large - scale models .",
    "in particular , determining the factors that control cloud fraction is a central issue in climate modeling , as small changes in cloud cover can dramatically affect the amount of energy received and emitted by the atmosphere .",
    "we found here that the rayleigh number has a direct impact on the cloud cover , which should be a cause of concern , as the rayleigh number in our numerical simulations ( @xmath125 ) is significantly smaller than its typical atmospheric value , @xmath126@xmath127 .",
