    "the natural environment presents the auditory system with the challenge of responding to sounds over many orders of magnitude ; the threshold of hearing and the threshold of pain differ by about thirteen orders of magnitude . for the ear to discriminate between sounds over such a large dynamic range ,",
    "it is necessary for auditory stimuli to be compressed into a much smaller , more achievable range of physical responses .",
    "this is accomplished through a nonlinear mechanism in which small amplitude sounds are amplified to a greater extent than larger amplitude sounds . in order to process complex sound stimuli , it is also necessary for the auditory system to distinguish between the frequency components of the stimuli .",
    "the ear s amplification and frequency discrimination properties are thought to be derived from a common , metabolically - powered mechanism , the details of which have been the topic of much investigation @xcite .    in both mammals and nonmammals , hair cells of the inner ear",
    "are responsible for translating sound - induced mechanical stimuli into a neurotransmitter signal which induces the firing of the auditory nerve @xcite .",
    "each hair cell consists of a cell body which is contacted from below by the auditory nerve and a hair bundle consisting of actin - supported fibers . when sound stimulates the auditory organ , the resulting motion of the hair bundle causes transduction channels to be mechanically pulled open .",
    "ionic current then enters the cell body through the transduction channels , thereby depolarizing the cell , and ultimately causing the release of neurotransmitter at the auditory nerve synapse .    in mammals , the frequency - discrimination properties of the basilar membrane , the membrane in which the hair cells are embedded , contribute to the auditory system s capacity to distinguish between sounds of different frequencies .",
    "by contrast in nonmammals , the surface in which the hair cells are embedded lacks tuning properties . the nonmammalian auditory system is thought to achieve its frequency tuning properties through two different mechanisms , both intrinsic to the hair cell .",
    "the first mechanism involves the mechanical motion of the hair bundle .",
    "experiments indicate that the hair bundle responds actively , with greater energy than provided by the stimulus , if forced near its resonance frequency @xcite .",
    "evidence for a second mechanism , referred to as electrical resonance , is provided by the decaying oscillations that are observed in the membrane potential of the cell body in response to constant current injection @xcite .",
    "these oscillations indicate that the cell body possesses a preferred response frequency .",
    "dynamical systems methods have proven useful in analyzing the frequency tuning and amplification properties of physiologically - based auditory models .",
    "interestingly , models of both the active motion of the hair bundle and the electrical resonance mechanism have been shown to be poised near a hopf bifurcation  @xcite .",
    "a hopf bifurcation is a robust mechanism for generating spontaneous oscillations as a control parameter of a nonlinear system is varied .",
    "it occurs when a static equilibrium loses stability via a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues ( of the associated linear stability problem ) crossing the imaginary axis in the complex plane with nonzero imaginary part .",
    "it has been suggested that the hair cell critically tunes itself so that its parameters are poised just below the bifurcation point , thereby making the cell sensitive to stimuli at the hopf bifurcation frequency , without causing spontaneous oscillations @xcite .",
    "these investigations determine the generic frequency tuning and amplification properties of a periodically - forced system in the vicinity of a hopf bifurcation ; specifically , they analyze the characteristics of solutions that are frequency - locked to a weak , additive resonant forcing term . sufficiently close to the hopf bifurcation point , the system is compressively nonlinear : small inputs are amplified to a greater extent than larger ones  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the compression of the dynamic range is accompanied by frequency tuning , which is sharper for small amplitude inputs than for larger amplitude signals .",
    "previous studies of hair cell amplification models have considered the normal form for a system near a hopf bifurcation without actually performing the normal form reduction from the physiologically relevant mathematical model . here , in appendix ii",
    ", we reduce the hudspeth and lewis model of the electrical tuning mechanism  @xcite to the normal form for a system near a hopf bifurcation , thereby determining the numerical values of the coefficients of the normal form corresponding to the model and parameters used by hudspeth and lewis .",
    "we find that the coefficient of the nonlinear term in the normal form has comparable real and imaginary parts ; it is not purely real as was assumed in earlier investigations  @xcite .",
    "we show that a result of the nonzero imaginary part is that the response of the system to resonant forcing may be hysteretic and that the frequency tuning curves are no longer symmetric about the resonance frequency .",
    "we further propose a model that describes weak coupling between the hair bundle amplification mechanism and the electrical resonance mechanism .",
    "we assume that both oscillation mechanisms are critically tuned to approximately the same resonant frequency and only weakly damped so that the hopf bifurcation normal form applies to each independently , _",
    "i.e. _ when the other mechanism is suppressed .",
    "we then assume weak linear coupling of the mechanisms , and direct forcing of the hair bundle at a frequency that is close to its natural frequency . as in earlier investigations ,",
    "the analysis focuses on the frequency - locked solutions , and , in particular , on how the magnitude of response grows with the forcing .",
    "we find that the combined critically - tuned amplification system , can lead to a response , @xmath0 , that scales with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the resonant forcing amplitude , thereby leading to enhanced amplification , @xmath3 , of small signals .",
    "we also explore the enhanced frequency - tuning characteristics of the combined mechanical and electrical amplification system , comparing it with those associated with a single tuning mechanism .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the reduced mathematical model , with the mathematical details of the reduction from the physiologically - detailed models relegated to appendix ii .",
    "section iii contains our analysis of the reduced model , focusing particularly on the simpler situation of unidirectional coupling from the hair bundle tuning mechanism to the electrical resonator .",
    "we present response - versus - forcing curves that demonstrate the transition from a linear response ( @xmath4 ) to a response @xmath5 as the amplitude of the ( weak ) signal increases .",
    "we also demonstrate the sharper tuning that is possible with the combined amplification system .",
    "finally , section iv compares our model predictions with published experimental auditory nerve data .",
    "two distinct mechanisms contribute to auditory tuning in nonmammalian vertebrates : an ` electrical ' resonance arising from an interplay between ionic currents through the cell membrane , and a ` mechanical ' resonance associated with the active motion of the stereocilia in reponse to stimuli at their resonance frequency .",
    "we start our discussion by focusing on the electrical resonance mechanism .",
    "the underlying biophysical components have been discussed by hudspeth and lewis @xcite , who performed a set of experiments that carefully characterized the dynamical properties of the major ion channels on the cell bodies of bullfrog saccular hair cells . on the basis of these experiments",
    ", they developed a single compartment model of the hair cell ( see appendix i ) using the simplifying assumption that only two major active ion channels , a voltage - gated calcium channel and a calcium - gated potassium channel , contribute to the cell s dynamical behavior . in this model , the dynamical evolution of the membrane potential @xmath6 is given by an equation based on the direct application of kirchoff s laws to a circuit that represents the flow of ions across the membrane :    @xmath7    here @xmath8 is the membrane potential and @xmath9 is the membrane capacitance per unit area . the voltage - gated calcium ( @xmath10 ) current is represented by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the maximum @xmath10 conductance per unit area , @xmath13 is the voltage - dependent fraction of open conformational subunits in the @xmath10 channels , and @xmath14 is the reversal potential for the @xmath10 ion channels .",
    "the @xmath10-gated potassium ( @xmath15 ) current is represented by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the maximum @xmath15 conductance per unit area , @xmath18 is the fraction of @xmath15 channels in one of their two open states , and @xmath19 is the reversal potential for the @xmath15 ion channels .",
    "the term @xmath20 represents all passive ion channels as a leak conductance @xmath21 per unit area and a reversal potential @xmath22 .",
    "the command current @xmath23 is directly injected into the cell body .",
    "the formulation of the model involves six additional equations ( see appendix i ) that describe the dynamical evolution of the fraction @xmath13 of open units in the @xmath10 channels , the intracellular concentration of @xmath10 ions close to the cell membrane , and the fraction of @xmath24-gated @xmath15 channels in each of their three closed states @xmath25 and two open states @xmath26 . in their seminal work @xcite , hudspeth and lewis ( h&l )",
    "experimentally characterized the value of the various parameters that appear in these equations .",
    "the h&l model reproduces qualitatively the decaying membrane potential oscillations observed in current - clamp experiments in which a current of constant amplitude @xmath23 is injected into the cell body @xcite . as shown in figure  [ fig : hudplots ] , the response of the membrane potential to a step current of amplitude @xmath23 depends crucially on the value of the injected current . for small injected currents ,",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : hudplots](a ) , the membrane potential exhibits an oscillatory decay to a new constant value . for larger current values , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : hudplots](b ) , the membrane potential decays to a new state that is oscillatory .",
    "this qualitative difference signals a transition between a regime in which the asymptotic state is a fixed point and a regime in which the asymptotic state is a limit cycle . in the h&l model ,",
    "this transition occurs by a hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    a hopf bifurcation occurs when a fixed point of a system of ode s undergoes a change in stability in which a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues @xmath27 , @xmath28 passes from the @xmath29 to the @xmath30 side of the imaginary axis in the complex plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : hudeigs ] shows the evolution of the eigenvalues of the h&l model linearized around its fixed point , as the input current is increased from 0 and 100 pa .",
    "note that three of the eigenvalues are always real and negative , and one complex conjugate pair remains in the @xmath29 semispace .",
    "the leading complex conjugate pair crosses the @xmath31 axis for @xmath32 pa ; this is the value of the input current at which the fixed point becomes unstable , as determined by fixing the parameters of the model at the experimentally  based estimates listed in hudspeth and lewis s original paper . that the h&l model is , for physiologically reasonable values of the parameters , poised near a hopf bifurcation has profound implications for the signal processing capabilities of the modelled hair cell .",
    "specifically , at the hopf bifurcation the system is compressively nonlinear , as it exhibits a large amplification of small amplitude inputs and a smaller amplification of large amplitude inputs @xcite .",
    "moreover , the resulting compression of the dynamic range is accompanied by a sharp frequency tuning of the response to small amplitude inputs and a broad tuning in the response to large amplitude inputs @xcite .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the model is asymptotically described by the amplitude of the mode associated with the most unstable eigenvector , which is the one associated with the complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues that cross the @xmath31 axis at the hopf bifurcation . sufficiently close to the bifurcation",
    ", the system can be generically described by a normal form equation  @xcite :    @xmath33    which characterizes the dynamical evolution of the complex amplitude @xmath34 of the most unstable mode . in this equation ,",
    "the parameter @xmath35 is a measure of the distance to the hopf bifurcation at @xmath36 ; @xmath35 is negative below the bifurcation and positive above .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is the frequency of the system at the bifurcation , and the parameter @xmath38 measures the shift in preferred frequency as the amplitude of the solution increases , as readily seen by setting @xmath39 in  ( [ eq : hopfnormal ] ) to establish that @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 distinguishes between supercritical @xmath43 and subcritical @xmath44 hopf bifurcations .",
    "we have carried out a standard nonlinear reduction of the h&l model to the normal form ( see appendix ii ) . in the resulting normal form ( [ eq : finalresult ] ) , @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath45 and @xmath42 is negative .",
    "this reduction thus establishes the supercritical nature of the hopf bifurcation in the h&l model . for this supercritical bifurcation",
    ", there is a transition from a stable fixed point to a state in which the fixed point becomes unstable and a stable limit cycle exists .",
    "moreover , in the supercritical case , the radius @xmath46 of the limit cycle grows , with distance past the bifurcation point , with the characteristic scaling @xmath47 .    in the current - clamp experiments conducted by hudspeth and lewis @xcite , the current injected into the cell was of constant amplitude .",
    "in contrast , natural inputs to the cell are due to a time - dependent , sound - induced mechanical displacement of the hair bundle , which results in time - dependent changes in the conductance through the transduction channels .",
    "because the transduction channels are passive , this time - dependence can be incorporated into the h&l model through the leakage conductance term on the right - hand - side of  ( [ eq : veq1 ] ) . in the case of a simple time - periodic conductance ,",
    "the reduction carried out in appendix ii suggests that for command currents close to @xmath48 the most important contribution of the time - periodic forcing to the asymptotic dynamics comes from the fourier component that is closest to the resonance frequency of the system .",
    "in the case of a weak periodic signal with frequency close to the resonator s frequency , the time - periodic input can be represented as an additive contribution to the amplitude equation , which then takes the form : @xmath49 due to the time - translation symmetry of the unforced case , we can , without loss of generality , assume that @xmath2 is real and positive . we note that earlier investigations of  ( [ eq : singleredf ] ) in the context of amplification mechanisms in auditory hair cells  @xcite assumed a real coefficient of the nonlinear term , _",
    "i.e. _ they made the nongeneric assumption that @xmath50 such that the preferred frequency of the nonlinear oscillator had no amplitude - dependence .",
    "we next consider the tuning mechanism associated with the mechanical deflection of the hair bundle .",
    "experiments in which a glass fiber was attached to the hair bundle and used to mechanically stimulate the bundle at a specific frequency showed that the hair bundles respond preferentially to stimuli at their resonance frequency @xcite .",
    "the motion of the hair bundles has been shown to be sensitive to the amount of calcium ion entering the transduction channels @xcite . a model for hair bundle motion due to calcium binding within the stereocilia",
    "was proposed by choe",
    "_ et  al_.  @xcite . in their model ,",
    "when transduction current enters the hair bundle @xmath51 ions attach themselves to the transduction channels at sites within the stereocilia ; this attachment causes an increase in tension , which in turn causes the channel to close @xcite .",
    "when the transduction channel closes , the @xmath10 ions detach themselves from the binding sites and the channel returns to its regular tension allowing the cycle to repeat itself .",
    "et al_. have shown that , when the parameters of their model are specified within physiologically reasonable ranges , the model is near a hopf bifurcation .",
    "experimental evidence also indicates that the relationship between stimulus magnitude and magnitude of the hair bundle oscillations obeys the scaling that would be expected for a system tuned near a hopf bifurcation @xcite , lending support to our assumption that a model describing the hair bundle dynamics is poised near a hopf bifurcation .",
    "assuming this second mechanism is tuned sufficiently close to a hopf bifurcation , it too can be reduced to the normal form  ( [ eq : hopfnormal ] ) for a system near a hopf bifurcation .",
    "it only remains to consider first the manner in which the two tuning mechanisms are coupled in the biological system , and second how this coupling should be represented in the reduced model .",
    "one clear source of coupling between the two tuning mechanisms is through the transduction current .",
    "the magnitude of the transduction current entering through the stereocilia is directly related to the magnitude of displacement of the stereocilia .",
    "this relationship between displacement and the amount of current entering the cell has been measured indirectly by measuring the change in the receptor potential of the cell in response to stereocilia displacements of different magnitudes @xcite .",
    "such experiments indicate that , in absence of stimuli , a small amount of current is flowing into the cell through the stereocilia . when the hair bundle is deflected in the negative direction , away from the tallest stereocilia , transduction channels close and the amount of current flowing into the cell decreases .",
    "similarly , when the hair bundle is deflected in the positive direction , the amount of current entering through the transduction channels increases and eventually saturates . for small displacements in the positive direction ,",
    "the relationship between the displacement of the hair bundle and the change in the receptor potential is approximately linear @xcite . as the amplitude of the hair bundle oscillations increases due to stimulation at the stereocilia s resonance frequency , the amount of current entering the cell body and providing a forcing to the second electrical resonance mechanism increases",
    "this clearly provides a means of coupling from the stereocilia tuning mechanism to the electrical resonance mechanism .",
    "there is also evidence for coupling in the reverse direction , from the electrical resonance mechanism to the hair bundle resonance mechanism , in that electrical stimulation of the cell body has been shown to induce displacement of the stereocilia @xcite .",
    "the exact mechanism for coupling in this direction is less clear .",
    "experimental comparisons between current injected into the cell body and the resulting displacement of the stereocilia indicate that the linear approximation is reasonable for small current injections @xcite .",
    "the presence of coupling in both directions raises the question of whether there are actually two separate tuning mechanisms or the stereocilia tuning mechanism is simply a manifestation of the electrical tuning mechanism .",
    "this question was addressed in experiments in which the cell body was voltage clamped to silence electrical resonance oscillations allowing the motion of the stereocilia to be probed separately @xcite .",
    "these experiments demonstrate active motion of the stereocilia even in the absence of the electrical resonance mechanism .",
    "electrical resonance experiments are often performed by direct current injection , with transduction channels blocked , so the independence of the electrical resonance mechanism from the active motion of the stereocilia was never in question .    from the biological evidence , it is reasonable to assume that the coupling between the two mechanisms is linear for sufficiently small forcing .",
    "this leads us to a reduced model consisting of two coupled amplitude equations of the form ,    @xmath52    @xmath53    in this model , ( [ eq : coupledampa ] ) represents the hair bundle resonance mechanism which receives a sound - induced time - dependent forcing ( @xmath54 ) as well as feedback from the electrical resonance mechanism ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : coupledampb ] ) represents the electrical resonance mechanism which receives a forcing proportional to the displacement of the stereocilia .",
    "note that we allowed for a phase difference @xmath56 in each of the coupling terms , with the corresponding parameters @xmath57 taken to be real and non - negative .",
    "moreover , we note that when both @xmath58 and @xmath59 are nonzero , then the hopf bifurcations that cause spontaneous oscillations in the unforced problem ( @xmath60 ) will shift away from @xmath61 . as detailed mathematically in appendix ii ,",
    "the model is valid for the case in which each system is tuned close to the hopf bifurcation ( @xmath62 sufficiently small ) , each system is tuned near the resonance frequency ( @xmath63 ) , and the forcing and the coupling are weak ( @xmath2 , @xmath57 sufficiently small ) .",
    "we have determined from hudspeth and lewis s model the numerical values of the coefficients @xmath64 of ( [ eq : coupledampb ] ) for h&l s physiological parameters .",
    "models also exist for the stereocilia mechanism , so it is possible that the same coefficients of  ( [ eq : coupledampa ] ) could be determined based on these models . performing the second reduction however would not be particularly useful in this paper because our analysis requires that both systems be tuned close to the same frequency .",
    "there are multiple ways to tune the physiological models such that they yield vibrations at a required frequency .",
    "thus , without a very clear idea of the physiologically reasonable method to adjust the model parameters , there is no way to determine a consistent result for the numerical values of the coefficients in the amplitude equation  ( [ eq : coupledampa ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , many of our conclusions regarding scaling laws hold provided that the hopf bifurcations are supercritical ( _ i.e. _ provided @xmath65 ) , and that our fundamental modeling assumptions are met .",
    "our analysis of the reduced model , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : coupledampa])-([eq : coupledampb ] ) , focuses on frequency - locked solutions of the form @xmath66 , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are constants .",
    "we wish to determine how the magnitude of the electrical response , measured by @xmath70 , scales with the sound - induced mechanical forcing amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "this scaling depends on the proximity to the hopf bifurcation , captured by the linear damping coefficients @xmath71 in ( [ eq : coupledampa])-([eq : coupledampb ] ) .",
    "it also depends on how closely tuned the natural frequencies , @xmath72 , of the nonlinear oscillation mechanisms are to each other and to the driving frequency , @xmath73 .",
    "substituting @xmath74 into ( [ eq : coupledampa])-([eq : coupledampb ] ) yields the following pair of complex - valued algebraic equations defining an implicit relationship between the real quantities @xmath2 and @xmath70 : @xmath75 we can solve  ( [ eq : m3 ] ) for @xmath76 in terms of @xmath70 : @xmath77 here we can determine the phase difference @xmath78 by the requirement that @xmath76 be real and nonnegative .",
    "substituting this expression into  ( [ eq : m1 ] ) , we find @xmath79 where @xmath80 again , the phase @xmath81 in  ( [ eq : poly ] ) is determined by the requirement that the forcing magnitude @xmath2 be real and non - negative .",
    "it immediately follows from the polynomial form of  ( [ eq : poly ] ) that the response @xmath70 need not be a single - valued function of @xmath2 .",
    "it also follows that , with increasing forcing , there is a transition from a linear regime , @xmath82 , for sufficiently small forcing , to a regime where @xmath83 for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "however , whether this transition occurs for small values of @xmath2 , for which the model  ( [ eq : coupledampa])-([eq : coupledampb ] ) is valid , depends on both the magnitude of the coupling coefficients @xmath57 and the magnitude of the linear coefficients @xmath84 . in particular ,",

    "we expect that if each independent amplification mechanism is well - tuned to the forcing frequency ( @xmath138 ) and the damping is small the coupled system will have a greater response than a system with only a single tuning mechanism . from  ( [ eq : alphacoeffs ] ) we see that the leading coefficients @xmath139 for @xmath140 in  ( [ eq : poly ] ) may decrease in magnitude , compared to the highest order coefficient @xmath141 , as the forcing frequency @xmath73 approaches the natural frequencies of the tuning mechanisms , @xmath72 .",

    "the exponent , @xmath153 , of this response - versus - forcing relationship , @xmath154 , provides a measure of the quality of the amplification ; small amplitude signals are amplified to a greater extent for smaller values of @xmath153 . for a system employing only a single tuning mechanism ,",
    "critically tuned to the bifurcation point and forcing frequency , the expected scaling is @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "the smaller exponent of @xmath156 , associated with the well - tuned coupled model , can provide more powerful amplification ( @xmath157 ) than a system with an isolated tuning mechanism . in more realistic situations for which some damping and/or detuning is present ( @xmath71 , @xmath158 ) , equation ( [ eq : poly ] ) predicts a transition from a regime in which @xmath159 for smaller forcings and a regime in which @xmath160 for sufficiently large signals . by measuring the response of the electrical resonance mechanism for different amplitudes of signal , it is possible to estimate @xmath153 ,",
    "although , depending upon which portion of the response - versus - forcing curve is sampled , different estimates for @xmath153 might be obtained experimentally .    in comparing the scaling predictions of our model to experiment , we turn to auditory nerve data .",
    "changes in the membrane potential of the hair cell body result in the release of neurotransmitters at the hair cell - auditory nerve synapse .",
    "larger depolarizations result in larger amounts of neurotransmitter release and thus a faster firing rate in the auditory nerve .",
    "there is biological evidence that , even for nonresonant stimuli , the firing rate at the auditory nerve is a nonlinear function of the sound stimulus .",
    "however , this nonlinearity , which occurs either due to synaptic effects or the relationship between hair bundle displacement and dc receptor potential , is factored out during the data analysis , allowing an estimate of @xmath153 to be made ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "numerous experiments have been performed in order to estimate the exponent , @xmath153 , of the response - versus - forcing relationship from experimental auditory nerve recordings .",
    "table i summarizes some recent measurements of @xmath153 taken from experiments in both mammals and nonmammals . in each case , @xmath153 is commonly measured to be smaller than 1/3 . in mammals , as in nonmammals , two different mechanisms have been proposed to explain amplification , the first due to active motion of outer hair cells @xcite , and the second due to the active motion of the hair bundles @xcite . while our results do not directly apply to mammalian data , as the coupling of the two active elements may be more complicated @xcite , it is noteworthy that compression estimates in mammals are similar to those in nonmammals .    [ cols=\"<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the observation of @xmath153 values smaller than 1/3 is interesting in that it indicates that the auditory system achieves greater compressions than would be expected from a system with a single tuning mechanism associated with a hopf bifurcation .",
    "experimental measurements of the forcing - versus - displacement relationship for individual hair bundles satisfy the @xmath161 scaling law expected for a system tuned near a generic hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "because effects at the synapse are removed during the data analysis , any additional compression must occur due to the interaction with the electrical resonance mechanism .",
    "some models have explained this increased compression by assuming within their model , that the leading nonlinear terms are higher than cubic ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "we propose that a more physically motivated way of achieving higher order compression would be through the coupling of two systems tuned near a hopf bifurcation . with the exception of three data points , all @xmath153-values in kppl and yates",
    "owl data are greater than .1 , with the majority of measurements lying between .1 and .3 @xcite .",
    "so their data is not inconsistent with what would be expected from a coupled system , which at best produces a @xmath153-value of 1/9 .",
    "if it is the case that the observed enhanced amplification occurs due to coupling between the two tuning mechanisms , this is an interesting result , because our analysis indicates that the tuning mechanisms must maintain themselves close to the bifurcation point and close to the same frequency for maximum amplification to be observed .",
    "it would be interesting both from a biological and mathematical perspective to understand how such fine tuning is achieved .",
    "some studies have suggested that stochastic effects may help the system adjust itself to the bifurcation point @xcite .",
    "another has suggested that with certain assumptions about the evolution of the bifurcation parameter , self - tuning occurs automatically @xcite .",
    "biologically , it has been suggested that adjustments in the tension of the hair bundle due to an actin myosin mechanism may act to keep the hair bundle properly tuned @xcite .",
    "another prediction of the model is that the response of the electrical resonance mechanism may be hysteretic for sufficiently large frequency detuning .",
    "it is worth noting that this feature arises as a direct result of shift in the natural frequency of the tuning mechanisms with increasing response , a feature that was not taken into account in previous models",
    ". it would be interesting if such bistability could be observed in experimental auditory nerve data .",
