    "understanding the solubility of a polymer in a solvent is a technologically important problem .",
    "it is well documented that `` like dissolves like '' but it is almost impossible to quantify the notion of `` likeness '' of materials .",
    "the understanding of solubility requires a basic understanding of `` likeness '' that is lacking at present .",
    "solubility parameters in all their incarnations are attempts to quantify this simple notion .",
    "there are several ways one can proceed to understand solubility by considering various thermodynamic quantities , not all of which are equivalent . however , almost all these current approaches are based on our thermodynamic understanding of mixtures at the level of the _ regular solution theory _ ( rst ) @xcite .    in practice",
    ", one usually introduces the hildebrand solubility parameter @xmath5 for a pure component in terms of @xmath6 the latter being the cohesive energy density of the pure ( p ) component and is normally reported at its boiling temperature . in this work , we will take this definition to be operational at any temperature , thus treating @xmath7  as a thermodynamic quantity , and not just a parameter .",
    "then its value at the boiling point will be the customarily quoted solubility parameter .",
    "the cohesive energy is related to the interaction energy @xmath8  obtained by subtracting the energy @xmath9  of the hypothetical _ athermal _ state of the pure component , the state in which the self - interactions ( both interparticle and intraparticle ) are absent , from the total energy @xmath10:@xmath11    the athermal state is usually taken to be at the same temperature @xmath12 and the volume @xmath13 as the system itself . in almost all cases of interest , @xmath9 is nothing but the kinetic energy and depends only on @xmath12 but not on @xmath14 thus , @xmath8 depends directly on the strength of the self - interaction , the only interaction present in a pure component and vanishes as self - interactions disappear , since @xmath15 as this happens .",
    "thus , @xmath16  can be used to estimate the strength of the self - interaction .",
    "one can also take the hypothetical state to be at the same @xmath12 and the pressure @xmath17 . in this case , there would in principle be a difference in the volume @xmath13 of the pure component and @xmath18 of the hypothetical state , but this difference will not change @xmath8 in ( [ interactionenergy ] ) .",
    "the hypothetical state is _ approximated _ in practice by the vapor phase at the boiling point in which the particles are assumed to be so far apart that their mutual interactions can be neglected .",
    "however , to be precise , it should be the vapor phase at zero pressure so that the volume is infinitely large to make the particle separation also infinitely large to ensure that they are non - interacting .",
    "this causes problems for polymers @xcite .",
    "our choice of the athermal state in ( [ interactionenergy ] ) to define @xmath8 overcomes these problems altogether .",
    "by definition,@xmath19 is the negative of the interaction energy density ( per unit volume @xmath20 of the system at a given temperature @xmath21 ( at the boiling point , @xmath13 is taken to be the volume of the liquid)@xmath4 the negative sign is to ensure @xmath22 since usually @xmath8  is negative to give cohesion . because of its dimensions , @xmath0  is also known as the _ cohesive pressure_. in this form , @xmath0 is a thermodynamic quantity and represents the thermodynamically averaged ( potential ) energy per unit volume of the pure component .",
    "thus , @xmath0 can be calculated even for macromolecules like polymers , which is of central interest in this work or for polar solvents .",
    "it is a macroscopic , i.e. a thermodynamic quantity characterizing  microscopic interparticle interactions in a pure component .",
    "this is important as it is well known that @xmath7  can not be measured directly as most polymers can not be vaporized without decomposing @xcite .",
    "thus , theoretical means are needed to evaluate @xmath23 which is our goal in this work .",
    "it should be noted from the above definition that @xmath0 contains the contributions from all kinds of forces ( van der waals , dipolar , and hydrogen bonding forces ) in the system @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we are only interested in the weak van der waals interactions for simplicity , even though the investigation can be easily extended to include other interactions .",
    "it should also be noted that the definition ( [ cohesive_def ] ) does not suffer from any inherent approximation , and can be used to calculate @xmath0 in any theory or by experimental measurements .",
    "as we will see , this is not true of the mutual cohesive density definition , which is introduced below .",
    "as it stands , the pure component quantity @xmath0 is oblivious to what may happen in a mixture formed with another component . despite this ,",
    "@xmath0 or @xmath7  is customarily interpreted as a rough measure of a solvent s ability to dissolve a solute ( `` like dissolves like '' ) .",
    "this interpretation of the solubility parameter is supposed to be reliable only for non - polar solvents formed of small molecules , and one usually refrains from using it for polar solvents such as esters , ketones , alcohol , etc .",
    "our interest is to investigate this quantity for macromolecules here , and its significance for the solubility in a mixture . according to the famous scatchard - hildebrand relation @xcite , the energy of mixing @xmath24 per unit volume for a binary mixture of two components @xmath25 and @xmath26 must always be non - negative since it is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the volume fractions of the two components @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are their solubility parameters .",
    "it is implicitly assumed here that the volume of mixing @xmath32 .",
    "thus , this expression does not contain the contribution from a non - zero volume of mixing .",
    "we will be interested in investigating this additional contribution in this work .",
    "later , we will discover that ( [ mixenergy0 ] ) can only be justified [ see ( [ volumefraction ] ) below ] , if we take @xmath33 as representing the monomer density ratios , or monomer fractions ; see below for precise definition . only in the rst",
    "can we identify @xmath28 with the volume fraction of the @xmath29th component .",
    "the significance of ( [ mixenergy0 ] ) is that the behavior of the mixture is completely determined by the pure component properties and provides a justification for `` like dissolves like '' .",
    "this must be a gross approximation even for non - polar systems and can not be true in general since the energy of mixing can be negative in many cases , as shown elsewhere @xcite , and as we will also see here later ; see , for example , fig .",
    "what we discover is that @xmath34 can be negative even if @xmath32 .",
    "thus , zero volume of mixing is not sufficient for the validity of ( [ mixenergy0 ] ) .    for the mixture",
    ", we need to introduce a thermodynamic or macroscopic quantity @xmath1 characterizing the mutual interaction between the two components ; this quantity should be determined by the microscopic interaction between the two components .",
    "therefore , the introduction of @xmath1 will , in principle , require comparing the mixture with a hypothetical mixture in which the two components have no mutual interactions similar to the way the pure component ( having self - interaction ) was compared with the athermal state above ( in which the self - interaction was absent ) for the introduction of @xmath2 the hypothetical state of the mixture should not be confused with the athermal state of the mixture ; the latter will require even the self interaction of the two components to be absent .",
    "the new hypothetical state will play an important role in our investigation and will be called _ self - interacting reference state _ ( srs ) .",
    "the mutual interaction energy in the binary mixture is obtained by subtracting the energy of srs from that of the mixture : @xmath35 compare with ( [ interactionenergy ] ) . just as before , srs can be taken at the same @xmath12 and @xmath36 or @xmath12 and @xmath17 as the mixture .",
    "this allows us to separate out the two contributions , one due to the presence of mutual interactions at the same volume @xmath37 of srs , and the second contribution due to merely a change in the volume from @xmath38 to @xmath39 this was not the case with @xmath8 above .",
    "each contribution of @xmath40 vanishes as mutual interactions disappear , since @xmath41 and @xmath42 as this happens .",
    "if @xmath43 is used to introduce a mutual cohesive energy density ( to be denoted later by @xmath3 ) , then such a density would most certainly vanish with vanishing mutual interaction strength",
    ". however , this is not the conventional approach adopted in the literature when introducing @xmath1 .",
    "rather , one considers the energy of mixing .",
    "we will compare the two approaches in this work .",
    "whether the conventionally defined @xmath1 vanishes with the mutual interactions remains to be verified .",
    "in addition , whether it is related to the pure component self interaction cohesive energy densities @xmath44 and @xmath45 in a trivial fashion such as ( [ london_berthelot_conj ] ) , see below , needs to be investigated@xmath4 as we will see , this will require further assumptions even within rst to which we now turn .",
    "the customary approach to introduce @xmath1  is to follow the classical approach developed by van laar , and hildebrand @xcite , which is based on rst , a theory that can be developed consistently only on a lattice .",
    "the theory describes an incompressible lattice model or a compressible model in which the volume of mixing @xmath46 is zero .",
    "the lattice model is introduced as follows .",
    "one usually takes a homogeneous lattice of coordination number @xmath47 and containing @xmath48 sites .",
    "the volume of the lattice is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the lattice cell volume .",
    "we place on this lattice the polymer ( component @xmath25 ) and the solvent ( component @xmath26 ) molecules in such a way that the connectivity of the molecules are kept intact .",
    "it should be stressed that the solvent molecules themselves may be polymeric in nature .",
    "in addition , the excluded volume interactions are enforced by requiring that no site can be occupied by more than one monomer at a time .",
    "the monomer densities of the two components @xmath51 ( @xmath52 are the densities of sites occupied by the @xmath29th component .",
    "two monomers belonging to components @xmath29 and @xmath53 respectively , interact with an energy @xmath54 @xmath55  only when they are nearest - neighbor .",
    "( this nearest - neighbor restriction can be easily relaxed , but we will not do that here for simplicity . ) the interaction between the polymer and the solvent is then characterized by a single excess energy parameter @xmath56 defined in general by the combination@xmath57 the origin of this combination is the fixed lattice connectivity as shown elsewhere @xcite@xmath4 for an incompressible binary mixture for which @xmath58 the excess energy @xmath59 is sufficient for a complete thermodynamic description on a lattice @xcite .    on the other hand , a compressible lattice model of the mixture , which requires introducing voids as a separate component ( @xmath60 ) , will usually require two additional excess energy parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xcite . in the following , we will implicitly assume that a void occupies a site of the lattice and has it occupies a volume @xmath63 in our picture , a pure component is a pseudo - binary mixture ( @xmath64 or @xmath65 while a compressible binary mixture is a pseudo - tertiary mixture ( @xmath66    since voids do not interact with themselves or with any other component , we must set@xmath67 so that the corresponding excess energy @xmath68 see ( [ excess_e ] ) , and is normally positive since @xmath69 is usually negative .",
    "two of the three conditions for rst  to be operative are    \\(i ) _ isometric mixing : _",
    "@xmath46 @xmath70 , and    \\(ii ) _ symmetric mixture : _ the two components must be of the _ same _ size and have the same interaction ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "this is a restatement of `` like dissolves like . ''",
    "the condition @xmath32 for _ isometric mixing _ is always satisfied in an incompressible system . for a compressible system , @xmath72 need not be zero , and one can have either an isometric or a non - isometric mixing depending on the conditions .",
    "the third condition for rst to be valid is the fulfillment of the    \\iii ) _ rma  limit : _ the interaction energy @xmath73 be extremely weak ( @xmath74 ) , and the coordination number @xmath47 of the lattice extremely large ( @xmath75 ) simultaneously so that the product@xmath76     indeed , if one introduces the dimensionless flory - huggins chi parameter @xmath77 where @xmath78 @xmath12  being the temperature in the kelvin scale , then one can also think of keeping @xmath79 fixed and finite , instead of @xmath80 under the simultaneous limit @xmath81 it is quite useful to think of rst in terms of these limits as both @xmath82 and @xmath47 are dimensionless .",
    "the above simultaneous limit gives rise to what is usually known as the _ random mixing approximation _ ( rma ) , and has been discussed in detail in a recent review article @xcite in the context of polymer mixtures .",
    "for an incompressible system , we need to keep only a single chi parameter @xmath83 fixed and finite in the limit .",
    "for a compressible system , one must also simultaneously keep the two additional chi parameters related to @xmath84 and @xmath85 and @xmath86 fixed and finite , where @xmath17 is the pressure @xcite .",
    "the rma limit can be applied even to a pure component ( for which the first two conditions are meaningless ) . it can also be applied when mixing is not isometric @xcite or when the mixture is not symmetric .",
    "therefore , rst is equivalent to the _ isometric rma_. in the unusual case @xmath87 ( @xmath88 the resulting isometric theory is known as the _ ideal solution theory _ , which will not be considered here as we are interested in the case @xmath89      the energy of mixing @xmath34 per unit volume is the central quantity for solubility considerations , and can be used to introduce an effective `` energetic '' chi @xcite as follows:@xmath90 which is a measure of the flory - huggins @xmath91 parameter or the excess energy @xmath92 ; the latter is directly related to the mutual interaction energy @xmath93 see ( [ excess_e ] ) , which explains the usefulness of @xmath34 for solubility considerations .",
    "one of the important consequences of the application of rst is the scatchard - hildebrand conjecture @xcite , according to which the energy of mixing is given by a non - negative form ( [ mixenergy0 ] ) .",
    "this is known to be violated ; see @xcite , and below .",
    "one of the reasons for its failure could be the much abused london - berthelot conjecture@xmath94 relating the mutual cohesive energy density @xmath1  with the pure component cohesive energy densities @xmath95 @xmath96  and used in the derivation of ( [ mixenergy0 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the london conjecture @xmath97 deals directly with the microscopic interaction energies , and is expected to hold for non - polar systems ; see also @xcite for an illuminating derivation and discussion . in the isometric rma limit",
    ", the two conjectures become the same in that ( [ london_conj ] ) implies ( [ london_berthelot_conj ] ) . in general , they are two _ independent _ conjectures .",
    "as we will demonstrate here , ( [ london_conj ] ) does not imply ( [ london_berthelot_conj ] ) once we go beyond the rma limit .",
    "we will also see that the non - negativity of the form ( [ mixenergy0 ] ) is violated even for isometric mixing .",
    "association of one component , such as through hydrogen bonding , usually makes @xmath98 on the other hand , complexing results in the opposite inequality @xmath99 it is most likely that the binary interaction between monomers of two distinct species will deviate from the london conjecture ( [ london_conj ] ) to some degree .",
    "thus , some restrictions have to be put on the possible relationship between these energy parameters for our numerical calculations .",
    "we have decided to consider only those parameters that satisfy the london conjecture ( [ london_conj ] ) in this work for physical systems .",
    "the deviation from the london - berthelot conjecture ( [ london_berthelot_conj ] ) is usually expressed in terms of a binary quantity @xmath100 defined via@xmath101 and it is usually believed that the magnitude of @xmath102is very small : @xmath103 it is possible that @xmath100 vanishes at isolated points , so that the london - berthelot conjecture becomes satisfied .",
    "this does not mean that the system obeys rst there .  as we will demonstrate here",
    ", we usually obtain a non - zero @xmath100 , thus implying a failure of the london - berthelot conjecture ( [ london_berthelot_conj ] ) , even if the london conjecture ( [ london_conj ] ) is taken to be operative .",
    "another root for the failure of ( [ london_berthelot_conj ] ) under this assumption could be non - isometric mixing . a third cause for the failure could be the corrections to the rma limit , since a real mixture is not going to truly follow rst . to separate the effects of the three causes",
    ", we will pay particular attention to @xmath100 in this work .",
    "we will assume the london conjecture ( [ london_conj ] ) to be valid , and consider the case of isometric mixing .",
    "we will then evaluate@xmath104 using a theory that goes beyond rst . a non - zero @xmath100 in this case",
    "will then be due to the corrections to the rma limiting behavior or rst .",
    "hildebrand @xcite has also argued that the solubility of a given solute in different solvents is determined by relative magnitudes of internal pressures , at least for nonpolar fluids .",
    "thus , we will also investigate the internal pressure , which is defined properly by @xmath105 where @xmath106  is the contribution to the pressure @xmath17 due to interactions in the system , and is obtained by subtracting @xmath107 from @xmath17 , where @xmath107 is the pressure of the hypothetical athermal state .",
    "the volume @xmath13 of the system , which has the pressure @xmath17 , may or may not be equal to the volume of the hypothetical athermal state .",
    "this means that @xmath108  will have different values depending on the choice of athermal state volume . in this work",
    ", we will only consider the athermal state whose volume is equal to the volume @xmath13 of the system ; its pressure then has the value @xmath109 which is not equal to the pressure @xmath17 of the system .",
    "as the interactions appear in the athermal system at constant volume , its pressure @xmath107 will reduces due to attractive interactions",
    ". this will give rise to @xmath110  which is negative so that @xmath108 will be a positive quantity for attractive interactions .",
    "for repulsive interactions , which we will not consider here , @xmath108 will turn out to be a negative quantity . in either case , as we will show here , @xmath108 should be distinguished from ( @xmath111 with which it is usually equated .",
    "their equality holds only in a very special case as we will see here .",
    "the availability of @xmath112-data makes it convenient to obtain ( @xmath113 therefore , it is not surprising to find it common to equate it with @xmath114 in a careful analysis , sauer and dee have shown a close relationship between ( @xmath115 and @xmath0 @xcite . here , we will investigate the relationship between @xmath108 and @xmath2      one can also think of an alternate scenario in which the pressure of the athermal state is kept constant as interactions appear in the athermal system .",
    "this pressure can be taken to be either @xmath17 or @xmath107 .",
    "let us keep its pressure to be @xmath17 , and so that its volume is @xmath116 in this case , the volume of the system @xmath13 will be smaller ( greater ) than @xmath18 of the athermal state because of the attractive ( repulsive ) interactions , so that one can also use the negative of the change in the volume @xmath117 as a measure of the attractive ( repulsive ) interactions .",
    "this allows us to introduce the following volume , to be called _ internal volume _ @xmath118 as a measure of cohesiveness .",
    "the two internal quantities are mutually related and one needs to study only one of them .",
    "in polymer solutions or blends of two components @xmath25 and @xmath26 , non - isometry is a rule rather than exception due to asymmetry in the degrees of polymerization and in the pure component interactions .",
    "thus , the regular solution theory is most certainly inoperative .",
    "an extension of rst , to be described as the non - isometric regular solution theory , allows for non - isometric mixing ( @xmath119 ) , and its successes and limitations have been considered elsewhere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* where it is simply called the regular solution theory ) .",
    "it is the extended theory that will be relevant for polymers .",
    "let us suppress the pure component index @xmath29 in the following . crudely speaking , @xmath0 for a pure component",
    "is supposed to be related to the pure component interaction parameter @xmath120 or more correctly @xmath121 however , @xmath59 is a microscopic system parameter , independent of the thermodynamic state of the system ; thus , it must be independent of the composition , the degree of polymerization , etc .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath0 is determined by the thermodynamic state .",
    "thus , its value will change with the thermodynamic state , the degree of polymerization , etc . only in the rma limit ,",
    "see ( [ rma_cohesive ] ) below , does one find a trivial proportionality relationship between the two quantities @xmath0 and @xmath122 the constant of proportionality being determined by the square of the pure component monomer density @xmath123 otherwise , there is no extra dependence on temperature and pressure of the system .",
    "this rma behavior is certainly not going to be observed in real systems , where we expect a complex relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath124 a similar criticism also applies to the behavior of @xmath125 for which one considers the energy of mixing @xmath126 see below .      in the rma limit of an incompressible binary mixture",
    ", it is found that @xmath1 is proportional to the mutual interaction energy @xmath127 between the two components , see ( [ rma_cohesivedensities ] ) below .",
    "thus , the sign of @xmath1 is determined by @xmath128  on the other hand , @xmath34 in the rma limit is proportional to the excess energy @xmath129 or @xmath130 so that its sign is determined by @xmath59 .",
    "however , the solubility of component @xmath25 in @xmath26 in a given state is determined not by their mutual interaction energy @xmath93 which is usually attractive , but by the sign of the excess energy @xmath122 and the entropy of mixing . for an incompressible binary mixture",
    ", we have only one exchange energy @xmath124 even away from the rma limit for the incompressible mixture , a positive @xmath59 implies that the two components will certainly phase separate at low enough temperatures .",
    "their high solubility ( at constant volume ) at very high temperatures is mostly due to the entropy of mixing , but the energy of mixing will play an important role at intermediate temperatures",
    ". the solubility increases as @xmath59  decreases .",
    "it also increases as @xmath12 increases , unless one encounters a lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) in which case the solubility will decrease with @xmath12 .",
    "it is well known that lcst can occur  in a blend due to compressibilty ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "similarly , the solubility at constant pressure will usually decrease with temperature .",
    "however , it is also possible for isobaric solubility to first increase and then decrease with @xmath21 thus , a properly defined mutual cohesive energy  for a compressible blend should be able to capture such a features .",
    "a negative @xmath59 implies that the two components will never phase separate .",
    "thus , a complete thermodynamic consideration is needed for a comprehensive study of solubility even when we are not in the rma limit , and requires investigating thermodynamic quantities such as @xmath1 or the ( energetic ) effective chi ( [ effective_echi ] ) to which we now turn@xmath4 this is even more so important when we need to account for compressibility .",
    "we have recently investigated a similar issue by considering the behavior of the effective chi in polymers @xcite , where an effective chi , relevant in scattering experiments , was defined in terms of the excess second derivative of the free energy with respect to some reference state .",
    "this investigation is different in spirit from other investigations in the literature , such as the one carried out by wolf and coworkers @xcite where one only considers the free energy of mixing . as said above ,",
    "@xmath24 or @xmath131 is determined by the excess energy @xmath132 and not by @xmath128 however , since @xmath1 is supposed to be a measure of @xmath93 it is defined indirectly by that part of the energy of mixing @xmath34 or @xmath133 see ( [ effective_echi ] ) , that is supposedly determined by the mutual energy of interaction @xmath127 . for this",
    ", one must subtract the contributions of the pure components from @xmath34 or @xmath134 see below for clarity .",
    "because of this , even though the previous investigation of the effective chi @xcite provides a clue to what might be expected as far as the complex behavior of @xmath131 is involved , a separate investigation is required for the behavior of the cohesive density @xmath1 , which we undertake here .",
    "we will borrow some of the ideas developed in @xcite , especially the requirements that    \\(i ) the cohesive energy density @xmath135 for an @xmath29-@xmath136 mixture vanish with @xmath137 and    \\(ii ) the formulas to determine @xmath135 reduce to the standard rma form under the rma limit .",
    "the first condition replaces the requirement in @xcite that the effective chi vanish with @xmath138 the second requirement is the same as in @xcite .",
    "its importance lies in the simple fact that any thermodynamically consistent theory must reduce to the same unique theory in the rma limit ; see @xcite for details .",
    "we also borrows the idea of _ reference states _ that would be fully explained below .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the non - isometric regular solution theory is more successful than rst but again only for a symmetric blend .",
    "a symmetric blend is one in which not only the two polymers have the same degree of polymerization ( @xmath139 ) , but they also have identical interactions in their pure states ( @xmath140 ) . for asymmetric blends ( blends that are not symmetric ) , even the non - isometric regular solution theory is qualitatively wrong .",
    "the significant conclusion of the previous work is that the recursive lattice theory developed in our group ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and briefly discussed in the next section to help the reader , is successful in explaining several experimental results where the non - isometric regular solution theory fails .",
    "a similar conclusion is also arrived at when we apply our recursive theory to study the behavior of effective chi @xcite .",
    "it was shown a while back that the recursive lattice theory is more reliable than the conventional mean field theory @xcite ; the latter is formulated by exploiting rma , which is what the regular solution theories are .",
    "the recursive lattice theory goes beyond rma and is successful in explaining several experimental observations that could not be explained by the mean field theory .",
    "our aim here is to apply the recursive theory to study solubility and to see the possible modifications due to    \\1 .",
    "finite @xmath141    \\2 .",
    "non - weak interactions ( @xmath142 ) ,    \\3 .",

    "however , we have argued that the energy of the mixture will be different from the sum of the pure component energies even if @xmath127 is absent .",
    "thus , @xmath1 does not necessarily measure mutual interactions .",
    "one of our aims was to see if some thermodynamic quantity can be identified that could play the role of a true @xmath1 that would vanish with @xmath128 this is the quantity @xmath3 that we have identified in this work .",

    "we confine ourselves to a lattice model , since the classical approach taken by van laar @xcite and hildebrand @xcite is also based on lattice models in that their theory can only be justified consistently by a lattice model .",
    "we then introduce two different reference states to be used for pure components and mixtures , respectively . for pure components ,",
    "we introduce a hypothetical reference state in which this self - interaction is absent .",

    ", our approach allows us to calculate @xmath0 and @xmath1  even for macromolecules like polymers , which is of central interest in this work or for polar solvents , which we do not consider here but hope to consider in a separate publication .",

    "in general , being a macroscopic quantity , @xmath0 is a function of the lattice coordination number @xmath47 , the degree of polymerization @xmath215 , and the interaction energy @xmath585 in addition to the thermodynamic state variables @xmath252 and @xmath17 or @xmath14 we have investigated all these dependences in our study here .",
    "the same is also true for @xmath403    based on the same philosophy , we need to introduce another hypothetical reference state called the self - interacting reference state ( srs ) for a blend , which differs from a real blend in that the mutual interactions are absent , but self - interactions are the same .",
    "the difference @xmath586 introduced in ( [ mutual_interactionenergy ] ) allows us to estimate the strength of the microscopic mutual interaction between the two components of a blend ; we denote this estimate by @xmath3 to distinguish it from the customary quantity @xmath1 originally due to van laar , and hildebrand and coworkers .",
    "however , @xmath586 is not what is usually used to define the mutual cohesive energy density @xmath403 rather , one considers the energy of mixing @xmath24 .",
    "we have compared the two approaches in this work .",
    "the conventional van laar - hildebrand approach to solubility is based on the use of the regular solution theory .",
    "thus , several of its consequences suffer from the limitations of the regular solution theory ( rst ) .",
    "one of the most severe limitations , as discussed in the introduction , is that the theory treats a solution as if it is incompressible .",
    "this is far from the truth for a real system .",
    "hence , one of the aims of this work is to investigate the finite compressibility effects , i.e. , the so - called `` equation - of - state '' effects . as a real solution most definitely does not obey the regular solution theory",
    ", the experimental results usually will not conform to the predictions of the theory .",
    "thus , we have revisited the solubility ideas within the framework of a new theory developed in our group .",
    "this theory goes beyond the regular solution theory and also incorporates equation - of - state effects .",
    "we have already found that this theory is able to explain various experimental observations , which the regular solution theory ( flory - huggins theory for polymers ) can not explain .",
    "therefore , we believe that the predictions of this theory are closer to real observations than those of the regular solution theory .      we have first studied the cohesive energy density @xmath0of a pure component .",
    "since it is determined by the energy density of vaporization , it is a quantity independent of the temperature .",
    "it is also clear from the discussion of the van der waals fluid that @xmath6 defined by ( [ cohesive_def ] ) , is independent of the temperature , since the parameter @xmath331 in ( [ vdw_a ] ) is considered @xmath12-independent .",
    "this particular aspect of @xmath0 ensures the equality of @xmath587and @xmath588 see ( [ pindedv ] ) . for a pure component ,",
    "hildebrand @xcite has argued that the solubility of a given solute in different solvents is determined by relative magnitudes of internal pressures , at least for nonpolar fluids .",
    "thus , we have also investigated the internal pressure . however , the equality ( [ pindedv ] ) is not valid in general as we have shown above .",
    "thus , the internal pressure , while a reliable and alternative measure of the cohesion of the system in its own right , can not be equated with @xmath288 their equality is shown to hold only in rma .",
    "if we allow @xmath331 in ( [ vdw_a ] ) to have a temperature - dependence , the equality ( [ pindedv ] ) will no longer remain valid .",
    "moreover , it can be easily checked that under this situation , @xmath589and @xmath0 for the van der waals fluid will no longer be the same .",
    "we have investigated the pure component @xmath0 using our recursive theory .",
    "we find that it is very different depending on whether we consider an isochoric process , in which case it is almost constant with @xmath12 , or an isobaric process , in which case it gradually decreases to zero at very high @xmath12 .",
    "in general , we find that @xmath590  we have found that isochoric @xmath0  and @xmath108 are almost constants as a function of @xmath21 it provides a strong argument in support of their usefulness as a suitable candidate for the cohesive pressure . but @xmath0  and @xmath108 do not remain almost constant in every process , as the isobaric results in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] clearly establish .",
    "the same figure also shows in its inset that the isobaric @xmath0 exhibits a discontinuity due to boiling , as expected .",
    "unfortunately , most of the experiments are done under isobaric conditions ; hence the use of isochoric cohesive quantities may not be useful , and even misleading and care has to be exercised .",
    "we also see that @xmath0 changes a lot over the temperature range and replacing it by its value at the boiling point may be not very useful in all cases .",
    "the cohesive energy also depends on the molecular weight , and usually decreases with @xmath215 as expected ; see fig .",
    "this is the situation for @xmath369 and should be contrasted with the behavior shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , where we show @xmath307 for @xmath345 and @xmath591 but for @xmath592 all other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "what we observe is that at low temperatures , @xmath307 for @xmath367 lies above the @xmath307 for @xmath277 while the situation is reversed at high temperatures .",
    "this crossover is due to the boiling transition that the smaller @xmath215 pure component must undergo at about @xmath593c .",
    "thus , @xmath307 decreases with increasing @xmath215 only far below the boiling temperatures .",
    "the dependence on the lattice coordination number @xmath47 is also not surprising : it increases with @xmath47 but requires end group correction in that @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath594 see fig .",
    "[ f9]@xmath4 this means that the solubility function @xmath7 also depends on the process , and its value at the boiling temperature of the system will be dramatically different in the two processes .",
    "we have also found , see fig .",

    "we now turn to the mutual cohesive energy density @xmath403 here , the situation is muddled since the definition of @xmath1 is based on a form ( [ mixenergy1 ] ) of the energy of mixing @xmath402  whose validity is questionable beyond rst .",
    "this should be contrasted with the definition of @xmath6defined by ( [ cohesive_def ] ) , which is independent of any particular theory .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 can be calculated in any theory without any further approximation except those inherent in the theory .",
    "it can also be measured directly by measuring @xmath595  and does not require any further approximation to extract it . on the other hand , the calculation of @xmath1 in any theory requires calculating @xmath34  in that theory ; thus , this calculation is based on the approximations inherent in the theory .",
    "however , one must still extract @xmath1 from the calculated @xmath34 by expressing  @xmath34  in the form ( [ mixenergy1 ] ) . as discussed above",
    ", this form is justified only in rst and @xmath1 in ( [ mixenergy1 ] ) at this level of the approximation is indeed a direct measure of the mutual interaction energy @xmath128 whether @xmath1 defined by the form ( [ mixenergy1 ] ) still has a direct dependence on @xmath127 is one of the questions we have investigated here by introducing srs . for @xmath1 to be a direct measure of the mutual interaction energy @xmath93 we have to ensure that it vanish in srs .",
    "what we have shown is that @xmath1 does not vanish in srs as seen in fig .",
    "a new measure of the mutual cohesive energy density @xmath3 is introduced in ( [ cohesiveirs ] ) , which has the desired property .",
    "the reference state srs behaves very different from the mixture or its athermal analog , as clearly seen from the figs .",
    "[ f19],[f14 ] , and [ f13 ] .",
    "in particular , srs has strong repulsive interactions between the two species .",
    "this results in the srs volume to be much larger than that of the mixture .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the two components may undergo phase separation in srs . its use to define @xmath3 ,",
    "therefore , should only be limited to the case where srs is a single phase state so as to compare with the mixture .",
    "we do not report any result when srs is not a single phase .",
    "we have found that @xmath3 has the correct behavior that it first rises and then decreases with @xmath12 for a compressible blend . as explained above",
    ", this is a reflection of the way the void density behaves with the temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "the rise and fall of cohesion is not apparent in the temperature - dependence of @xmath1 .",
    "it has also been shown that @xmath3  can be expressed in terms of @xmath403 therefore , we have basically explored the behavior of @xmath1 more than that of @xmath522  as expected , and as shown in fig .",
    "[ f12 ] , @xmath1 increases with @xmath359 however , it is not just simply a linear function of @xmath47 , as seen in fig .",
    "it is also clear from the behavior in this figure that @xmath1 changes its curvature with @xmath21 thus , @xmath1 is not linear with the inverse temperature @xmath596 over a wide range of temperatures .    we have been specifically interested in the contribution due to volume of mixing . for this reason ,",
    "we have considered three different kinds of isometric mixing ( zero volume of mixing ) , two of which we have called edim and ddim .",
    "these are introduced in sect . v. the third isometric mixing is studied as part of isochoric processes , which we have also considered .",
    "the fourth process is an isobaric process in which mixing is at constant pressure .",
    "we have also compared @xmath1 with a related internal pressure quantity @xmath597 which is another measure of the mutual cohesive energy density or pressure@xmath4 for a particular process , the two quantities behave similarly , though their magnitudes are different in that @xmath598 see fig .",
    "[ f18 - 1 ] .",
    "we have found that isobaric and edim quantities are somewhat similar , and both are different from the ddim  quantities .",
    "all three quantities have a strong temperature dependence , but the isochoric quantity is very different in that @xmath1 or @xmath483 for the latter remains almost a constant with @xmath21    we have paid special attention to the violation of the scatchard - hildebrand conjecture ( [ mixenergy0 ] ) even when the microscopic interactions obey the london conjecture ( [ london_conj ] ) .",
    "we find that even under isometric mixing ( edim ) , the energy of mixing can become negative , as seen in fig .",
    "there is another possible source of violation of the scatchard - hildebrand conjecture seen in fig .",
    "[ f15 ] . here",
    ", the pure components in the isobaric and ddim processes remain the same , so that the pure component solubilities @xmath7 are the same .",
    "therefore , from ( [ mixenergy0 ] ) we would conclude that the energy of mixing should be zero , regardless of the process .",
    "what we find is that the energy of mixing is not only not zero , it is also different in the two processes .",
    "this violation is due to non - random mixing caused by size and/or interaction strength disparity .",
    "we have also investigated the behavior of the binary correction @xmath478 we find that it need not be small . in particular , we find that it becomes very large in isobaric and ddim processes as seen in fig .",
    "[ f18 ] . as the pressure increases , @xmath100 decreases in magnitude and the deviation from the london - berthelot conjecture ( [ london_berthelot_conj ] ) becomes smaller .",
    "this effect shows that the deviation from the london - berthelot conjecture is due to the presence of compressibility .",
    "thus , the behavior of the free volume determines that of @xmath478 in the isobaric case , we have discovered a very interesting fact .",
    "the behavior of @xmath100 mimics the behavior of the volume of mixing as seen clearly in figs .",
    "[ f23 ] , and [ f24 ] .",
    "this observation requires further investigation to see if there is something unusual about isobaric processes or it is jut due to non - isometric mixing in the presence of free volume ..          j.j .",
