    "the small likelihood of finding a supernova and a grb in such a small field over such a short interval of time suggests that sn  1998bw and grb980425 are related ( galama et al .",

    "1998b ) .",
    "the early optical spectra of sn 1998bw apparently lack dominant line features , displaying only some broad emissions at 500 , 620 and 800 nm ( galama et al .",

    "these were shown to be the emission components of p - cygni profiles of very broad line blends .",
    "they are caused mostly by feii lines in the blue , by siii near 600 nm and by oi + caii near 720 nm ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter imn98 ) .",
    "the absence of any hydrogen line after subtraction of the galaxy background and the fact that the si ii line at 615 nm has a very large velocity indicate that the supernova is neither a type ii nor a normal type ia ( galama et al .",
    ". following the conventional classification scheme ( filippenko 1997 ) , the lack of strong he i features led patat & piemonte ( 1998 ) to conclude that sn 1998bw is likely to be a type ic supernova ( sn ic ) rather than a type ib .",
    "the light curve of sn 1998bw ( galama et al .",
    "1998b ) showed a very early rise and reached a peak at @xmath5 17 days ( in the v band ) after the explosion , and then has been declining exponentially with time ( mckenzie & schaefer 1999 ; patat et al .",
    "this clearly indicates that the light curve is not a typical optical afterglow of a gamma - ray burst , but it is powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath2ni and @xmath2co as in usual supernovae ( imn98 ) .",
    "the distance modulus to sn  1998bw is estimated as @xmath6  mag , so that the peak luminosity of sn  1998bw is @xmath7 ergs sec@xmath8 , which is about ten times brighter than typical sne ib / ic ( clocchiatti & wheeler 1997 ) .",
    "to achieve such a high luminosity , a large amount of @xmath2ni must have been synthesized in sn1998bw ( imn98 ; woosley , eastman & schmidt 1999 ) , again about ten times as much as that produced in typical core - collapse - induced supernovae . the very broad spectral features and",

    "the energetic explosion ( @xmath10 ergs ) of a c+o star of 13.8 @xmath0 successfully fit the first 60 days of the light curve and the early spectra , although the synthetic spectral lines were still narrower than the very broad observed features ( imn98 ) .",
    "since the kinetic energy is more than one order of magnitude larger than the energy of typical supernovae , sn 1998bw was called a `` hypernova '' ( imn98 ) , a term we use to describe events with @xmath11 erg without specifying whether the central engine is a collapser ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , a magnetar ( nakamura 1998 ; wheeler et al .",
    "2000 ) or a pair - instability supernova .",
    "interestingly , photometry after @xmath12 days showed that sn  1998bw declined significantly more slowly than the rate predicted by the model of imn98 ( mckenzie & schaefer 1999 ; patat et al .",
    "also the bolometric light curve has been constructed up to day 500 ( patat et al . 2000 ; sollerman et al . 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , we have recomputed the light curve of sn  1998bw using progenitors of different masses and explosions of different energies , and provide better estimates for these parameters .",

    "the position of the mass cut is chosen so that the ejected mass of @xmath2ni is the value required to explain the observed peak brightness of sn  1998bw by radioactive decay heating .",
    "the compact remnant in these hypernova models may well be a black hole , because @xmath18 can exceed , sometimes significantly , the maximum mass of a stable neutron star .",
    "the hydrodynamics at early phases was calculated using a lagrangian ppm code ( colella & woodward 1984 ) .",
    "all models are spherically symmetric .",

    "1989 ; hachisu et al .",
    "1991 , 1994 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "although bare c+o stars , the progenitors of sne ic , lack composition interfaces with such pronounced density jumps , rayleigh - taylor instabilities can be driven by neutrino heating and develop at the ni+si / o interface ( kifonidis et al .",
    "in addition , polarization measurements suggested that sne ic , and hypernovae in particular , are asymmetric explosions ( wang et al .",
    "1999 ; danziger et al . 1999 ; patat et al .",
    "the asymmetry of the explosion may reinforce the instability and bring heavy elements up to high velocity layers .",
    "this is particularly true of jet - like explosions , where it is likely that extensive mixing takes place in velocity space . in view of the large uncertainties in our knowledge of the mixing process , we assume that the material ejected is uniformly mixed out to a velocity @xmath24 .",
    "the hydrodynamical models become homologous ( @xmath25 ) at @xmath26 sec , and are then used as input for a radiation transfer code . the lines in figure [ fig : vvsrho ]",

    "synthetic light curves are computed with a radiative transfer code ( iwamoto et al .",
    "2000 ) which takes into account the balance between photo - ionizations and recombinations and includes a simplified treatment of line opacity .",
    "the width of the light curve peak , @xmath28 , depends on @xmath9 and @xmath13 approximately as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the optical opacity and the speed of light , respectively ( arnett 1982 ) .",
    "this means that the light curve can be reproduced with different explosion models that have the same values of @xmath32 .",
    "however , these parameters can be further constrained from both photospheric velocities and spectra because the velocity scales roughly as @xmath33 .",
    "the light curve shape depends also on the distribution of the radioactive heating source @xmath2ni , for which we examine the dependence on @xmath34 (  [ sec : hm ] ) .",

    "figure [ fig : lc2 ] shows the bolometric light curves of the energetic models co138e50 ( solid ) and co138e30 ( long - dashed ) , and figure [ fig : lc3 ] the less energetic models co138e7 ( short - dashed ) and co138e1 ( dash - dotted ) .    figure [ fig : vph ] shows the evolution of the calculated photospheric velocities of co138e50 ( solid line ) , co138e30 ( long - dashed line ) , co138e7 ( short - dashed line ) , and co138e1 ( dash - dotted line ) compared with those obtained from spectral models ( filled circles ) , and with the observed velocity of the si ii 635.5 nm doublet measured in the spectra at the absorption core ( open circles ; patat et al . 2000 ) , and that of the ca ii h + k doublet measured in the spectrum of may 23 ( square ; @xcite ) .",
    "the early part of the light curve ( @xmath38 days ) is well reproduced by the two energetic models , co138e50 and co138e30 .",
    "the difference between the two curves is too small to see on the scale of figure [ fig : lc2 ] because the light curve width scales as @xmath39 .",
    "the early part of the light curve also depends on the @xmath2ni distribution in the ejecta . to reproduce the early sharp rise of the light curve , extensive mixing of @xmath2ni , out to @xmath40 km s@xmath8 for co138e50 and @xmath41 km s@xmath8 for co138e30 ,",
    "is required .",
    "a better fit can be obtained if we adopt the following ad hoc @xmath2ni distribution : x(@xmath2ni ) = 0.79 at @xmath42 km s@xmath8 , 0.011 at @xmath43 11 - 17,000 km s@xmath8 , and 0.032 at @xmath44 17 - 40,000 km s@xmath8 , where x(@xmath2ni ) denotes the mass fraction of @xmath2ni .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : lce50 ] .",
    "such a non - uniform distribution of @xmath2ni might be due to the mixing caused by rayleigh - taylor instability (  [ sec : hm ] ) , or reflect a complicated structure of a possible jet - like ejecta (  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2ni mass is determined to be 0.4 @xmath0 from the fitting of the maximum luminosity and the date of maximum .",
    "( note that imn98 slightly overestimated the mass of @xmath2ni because they assumed that the bolometric correction is negligible and adopted a different absorption and distance . )    in contrast , the early light curves of the less energetic models ( co138e7 and co138e1 ) evolve too slowly , reaching the maximum too late as compared with the observations ( figure [ fig : lc3 ] ) , even if @xmath2ni is distributed uniformly throughout the ejecta .",
    "the photospheric velocities @xmath45 provide clearer diagnostics to distinguish between co138e50 and co138e30 .",
    "in particular , in the early phase ( @xmath46 20 days ) , @xmath45 of co138e50 is in good agreement with the observed @xmath45 , while @xmath45 of co138e30 is clearly too low to be consistent with the observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vph ] ) .    in the early phase ,",
    "therefore , model co138e50 shows the best agreement with both the light curve and the photospheric velocities of sn  1998bw .",
    "the synthetic spectra also require the most energetic model co138e50 as will be shown in ",
    "[ sec : spectra ] .",
    "co138e50 has the same mass as the best model in imn98 but a larger @xmath9 , which is necessary especially to improve the fit to the spectra (  [ sec : spectra ] ) .      at intermediate phases ( @xmath47 - @xmath48 days ) ,",
    "the decline rate of the light curve is determined mainly by the fraction of the @xmath4-rays emitted by @xmath2co decay which are trapped in the ejecta .",
    "the optical depth of the ejecta to the @xmath4-rays scales as @xmath49 .",
    "thus the behaviour of the various models can be seen more easily than at earlier phases as follows :    1 .",
    "the light curve of co138e50 is consistent with sn1998bw until day 50 but declines faster than the observation afterwards ( figure [ fig : lc2 ] ; mckenzie & schaefer 1999 ; patat et al .",
    "the light curve of co138e30 declines more slowly than that of co138e50 , and is in better agreement with sn1998bw , but it still declines faster than the observations .",
    "2 .   the photospheric velocity @xmath45 shows a similar tendency .",
    "figure [ fig : vph ] shows that @xmath45 of co138e50 is the best fit to the data for the first 20 days , but afterwards @xmath45 of co138e30 gives as good a fit .",
    "the other two models do not fit @xmath50 at all .",
    "figure [ fig : lc3 ] shows that the apparently exponential decline of sn1998bw after day 60 ( mckenzie & schaefer 1999 ; patat et al .",
    "2000 ) is well reproduced by the lower energy model co138e7 . in this model , @xmath4-ray trapping is more efficient than co138e50 and co138e30 , but the observed low flux level at this phase requires a reduced @xmath2ni mass of @xmath51 ( dotted line ) .",
    "note , however , that @xmath51 of @xmath2ni is too small to reproduce the observed light curve maximum .",
    "note also that because of the interplay of @xmath52 and @xmath53(ni ) , it is difficult to establish those parameters from the intermediate phase light curve alone .",
    "the normal sn ic model co138e1 in figure [ fig : lc3 ] is slow enough to trap most of the @xmath4-rays emitted from the @xmath2co decay .",
    "the decline of the light curve is therefore too slow compared with the observed rate .",
    "these comparisons between sn 1998bw and the model light curves and @xmath45 in figures [ fig : lc2 ] , [ fig : lc3 ] , & [ fig : vph ] indicate that @xmath4-ray deposition after about day 50 in sn  1998bw is more efficient than predicted by co138e50 and e30 , although these models give an appropriate description of the early light curve and spectra .",
    "higher deposition can be achieved if there exists a significant amount of low - velocity and high - density material .",
    "indications of the presence of a low - velocity , high - density region suggest that the ejecta distribution is not spherically symmetric as will be discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we note that such indications are also found for sn  1997ef ( iwamoto et al .",
    "2000 ; mazzali , iwamoto , & nomoto 2000a ) , a lower - energy analogue of sn  1998bw .",
    "after day @xmath5 200 the decline of the model light curve becomes slower , and it approaches the half - life of @xmath2co decay around day 400 . at @xmath54 days most @xmath4-rays escape from the ejecta .",
    "the @xmath4-ray deposition fraction at 400 days is 1% , 1.5% , 6% , and 13% for co138e50 , e30 , e7 , and e1 , respectively . on the other hand , kinetic energies of positrons emitted from the decay of @xmath2co",
    "are supposed to be fully thermalized because of the postulated weak magnetic field ( e.g. , colgate & petchek 1979 ) .",
    "therefore , positron kinetic energy deposition determines the light curve at @xmath54 days ( dotted line in figure [ fig : lc2 ] ) . here",
    "the luminosity by positron deposition is given as @xmath55 where the positron fraction in energy is 3.5 percent ( e.g. , axelrod 1980 ) .",
    "( see cappellaro et al .",
    "1997 and milne et al .",
    "1999 for the light curves including positron escape . )",
    "if the observed tail should follow the positron - powered light curve , the @xmath2co mass could be determined directly . since positron deposition should occur almost on the spot ,",
    "this determination does not depend much on any asphericity of the ejecta .    on june 11 , 2000 , which corresponds to a sn epoch of",
    "@xmath56 778 days , hst observations detected a point - like source at the position of sn1998bw ( fynbo et al .",
    "the observed magnitude ( v - mag 25.41 @xmath57 0.25 ) is consistent with the prediction of co138e7 ( figure [ fig : lc2 ] ) but brighter than co138e50 ( figure [ fig : lc3 ] ) . the observed luminosity would even be higher than co138e7 , if the bolometric correction was significant .",
    "in any case , these comparisons suggest that the positron contribution is not dominant yet around day 800 .",
    "in figure [ fig : spc ] we show the synthetic spectra obtained for the same 3 epochs fitted in imn98 ( continuous lines ) compared with spectra observed at eso ( bold lines ) .",
    "we used model co138e50 and computed synthetic spectra with a monte carlo model ( mazzali & lucy 1993 ) , improved with the inclusion of photon branching and a new extended and improved line list ( lucy 1999 ; mazzali 2000 ) .",
    "the synthetic spectra were computed using the luminosity derived from the light curve , a distance modulus of @xmath6  mag and @xmath37 .",
    "the assumption of low reddening is supported by the upper limit of 0.1    in the equivalent width of the na  i  d line obtained from high - resolution spectra ( patat et  al .",
    "the observed spectra used here ( solid lines ) are the ` definitive ' , fully reduced version of the same eso spectra shown in imn98 , and are calibrated with respect to the v photometry .",
    "the residual correction factors for the other bands are usually very close to 1 , but they are @xmath58 for b in the may 11 and 23 spectra .",
    "therefore , the new models ( i.e. 3 epochs of co138e50 ) have somewhat different parameters than those of imn98 .",
    "both the luminosities and the photospheric velocities are larger than in imn98 .",
    "the photospheric velocity is now in better agreement with the measured velocity of the si  ii  line ( imn98 , figure 3 ) .",
    "the synthetic spectra clearly improve over those of imn98 , especially at the earliest epochs .",
    "absorptions not caused by broad blends of many lines of moderate strength , such as the si  ii  feature near 6000  and , in particular , the o  i+ca  ii  feature between 7000 and 8000 , are now much broader , in significantly better agreement with the data",
    ". nevertheless , the blue sides of those absorptions are still too narrow , indicating that even the new model co138e50 may not contain enough mass at the highest velocities .",
    "therefore we introduced an arbitrary change to the original co138e50 density structure .",
    "several possibilities were tested , and improved results were obtained when the density slope was reduced from @xmath59 to @xmath60 at @xmath61  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "this does not introduce a significant change in @xmath13 , and increases @xmath9 by only about 10% , but it does increase the density at high velocities , leading to significant absorption at @xmath62  km  s@xmath8 in the strongest lines , especially the ca  ii  ir triplet , extending the absorption troughs to the blue .",
    "the corresponding synthetic spectra are shown as the dotted lines in figure [ fig : spc ] .",
    "the effect of the change is of course largest at the earliest epochs . although the overall agreement with the observed spectra is better , several problems remain , the most severe of which is clearly the excessive strength of the o  i  line at 7200  on may 11 and 23 .",
    "the composition of the highest velocity ejecta is dominated by o in our 1d models , and it is difficult to make that line become weaker . on 23 may , the synthetic ca  ii",
    "ir triplet matches the weak feature at 8000 , which is first seen on 11 may and which continues to grow until it finally causes the wavelength of the absorption minimum of the entire broad feature to shift to @xmath63  ( patat et  al .",
    "this is rather a peculiar behavior , because on 3 may the o  i  and ca  ii  lines had to blend much more to give rise to the observed broad feature , which then had a minimum at 7000 .",
    "the synthetic o  i  line is too strong and too fast .",
    "the core of the broad feature , if it is interpreted as o  i  7774 , indicates a velocity of 10500 km  s@xmath8  on may 11 and 6000 km  s@xmath8  on may 23 .",
    "this is significantly lower than the corresponding velocity of the model photosphere .",
    "actually , the definition of a photosphere at very red wavelengths is not very accurate , because the density of spectral lines is low and so line opacity does not define a pseudo - continuum in that region .",
    "therefore , the observations probably indicate that a large fraction of the o is located at low velocities .",
    "a very flat ( @xmath64 ) density distribution was also used by branch ( 2000 ) to fit the spectrum of sn  1998bw .",
    "this dependence is however too flat when we use our mc model , because the ionization of , e.g. , ca  ii  does not fall as steeply as he assumed . on the other hand ,",
    "branch s value of @xmath9 ( @xmath65 erg ) is similar to ours , but he quotes a mass of @xmath66 above 7000  km  s@xmath8 , while in our case the mass above that velocity is as large as @xmath67 .",
    "such a flat density distribution at high velocities is also required to fit the spectrum of another hypernova , sn  1997ef ( mazzali et al .",
    "this might indicate that the progenitors of these hypernovae underwent very extensive mass loss ; the outer density structure of the ejecta is flatter than that of ordinary giants , and comparable to that of a mass - losing star .    clearly",
    ", a definitive solution has not been found yet .",
    "it is quite possible that only by taking into account departures from spherical symmetry will it be possible to obtain a really accurate fit to the spectra . nevertheless , considering the complexity of the problem , our fits",
    "at least demonstrate that a large @xmath9 is necessary and that the o - dominated composition of the sn ic model yields quite a reasonable reproduction of the observations .",
    "we calculated explosive nucleosynthesis using a detailed nuclear reaction network ( thielemann , nomoto & hashimoto 1996 ; nakamura et al .",
    "our calculations are performed in two steps .",
    "the first step is a hydrodynamical simulation of the explosion with a small nuclear reaction network containing only 13 alpha nuclei ( @xmath68he , @xmath69c , @xmath70o , @xmath71ne , @xmath72 mg , @xmath73si , @xmath74s , @xmath75ar , @xmath76ca , @xmath77ti , @xmath78cr , @xmath79fe , and @xmath2ni ) , as described in ",
    "[ sec : hm ] . in the second step ,",
    "post - processing calculations are performed at each mesh point of the hydrodynamical model with the extended reaction network ( hix & thielemann 1996 ) , which contains 211 isotopes up to @xmath80ge .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : nssph ] shows the isotopic composition of the ejecta of the hypernova model co138e50 as a function of the enclosed mass @xmath27 and of the expansion velocity .",
    "the nucleosynthesis in other hypernova and supernova models ( co138e30 , co138e7 , co138e1 ) is also shown in figure [ fig : nssph ] for comparison .",
    "the yields of the hypernova and supernova models are summarized in table [ tab : ns ] .",
    "table [ tab : ele50 ] and figure [ fig : ratioe50 ] give respectively more detailed yields and the abundances of stable isotopes relative to the solar values for model co138e50 . from these figures and tables ,",
    "we note the following characteristics of nucleosynthesis of hyper - energetic explosions compared with normal energy explosions .    1 .",
    "the complete si - burning region where @xmath2ni is produced is extended further out ( in mass coordinates ) as the explosion energy increases .",
    "how much processed matter is ejected from this region depends on the mass cut . compared with normal core - collapse supernovae ,",
    "the much larger amount of @xmath2ni ( @xmath81 ) observed in sn1998bw implies that the mass cut is deeper , so that the elements synthesized in this region , such as @xmath82cu , @xmath83zn , and @xmath84ge ( which decay into @xmath82co , @xmath83cu , and @xmath84zn , respectively ) , are ejected more abundantly . among hypernova models ,",
    "more energetic models produce more @xmath2ni in the incomplete si burning region ( see ( 3 ) below ) , and thus @xmath18 is larger to eject @xmath85 @xmath2ni as constrained from the light curve of sn  1998bw ( figure [ fig : nssph ] ) .",
    "2 .   in the complete si - burning region of the hypernova models ( co138e50/e30 )",
    ", elements produced by @xmath86-rich freezeout are enhanced because nucleosynthesis proceeds at lower densities than in co138e1 .",
    "figure [ fig : nssph ] clearly shows a trend that a larger amount of @xmath68he is left in more energetic explosions .",
    "hence , the mass fractions of the species synthesized through @xmath86-particle capture , such as @xmath77ti and @xmath78cr ( which decay into @xmath77ca and @xmath78ti , respectively ) is larger in co138e50/e30/e7 than co138e1 .",
    "the integrated mass of these species depends on @xmath17 . for co138e50 ,",
    "the ejected mass of @xmath77ti is smaller than in other models because of its larger @xmath18 .",
    "note that the @xmath68he produced even in the most energetic models has a velocity significantly smaller than that of the he shell identified in sn  1998bw at a velocity of 18300 km  s@xmath8  by patat et al .",

    "spectral evidence for low velocity he in sn  1998bw is unclear , however the distribution of he depends on mixing in velocity space .",
    "the incomplete si - burning region is more massive in more energetic explosions .",
    "the main products in this region are @xmath73si , @xmath74s , and @xmath2ni .",
    "co138e50 produces 0.2@xmath0 of @xmath2ni in this region .",
    "other important species such as @xmath79fe , @xmath87co , and @xmath88mn ( decaying into @xmath79cr , @xmath87mn , and @xmath88v , respectively ) are synthesized more abundantly in the more energetic explosions .",

    "oxygen burning takes place in more extended , lower density regions .",
    "o , c , and al are burned more efficiently in these cases , and the abundances of the elements in the ejecta are smaller , while a larger amount of ash products such as si , s and ar is synthesized by oxygen burning .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a model for sn  1998bw which is in better agreement with the early observations than the previous model in imn98 .",
    "models with different @xmath9 yield different synthetic spectra , and by comparing with the observed early - time spectra of sn  1998bw and trying to fit the very broad absorption features , we selected model co138e50 with @xmath89 and @xmath90  erg as the best match to the early data .",
    "the large value of @xmath9 qualifies sn  1998bw as ` the ' type ic hypernova .",
    "( sn iin 1997cy may be called a `` type iin hypernova '' ; germany et al .",
    "2000 ; turatto et al .",
    "the mass of the progenitor c+o star is @xmath91 , corresponding to a main sequence mass of @xmath92 .",
    "all models require @xmath53(@xmath2ni)@xmath93 to power the bright light curve peak.ni of @xmath94 - @xmath95 was necessary to power the late light curve based on the model co138 ( imn98 ) , which is consistent with our results . ]",
    "this is about an order of magnitude larger than in typical core - collapse sne .",
    "the compact remnant is probably a black hole , because its mass exceeds @xmath96 as constrained from the mass of @xmath2ni .    although the early light curve of sn1998bw ( @xmath97 50 days ) is reproduced well by the most energetic model co138e50 , the observed tail declines more slowly than this model does (  [ sec : lc ] ) .",
    "the lower energy model co138e30 is in better agreement with observations at @xmath97 100 days but it still declines is too fast .",
    "model co138e7 has a slower tail and can reproduce the observed light curve tail if a smaller @xmath2ni mass of 0.28 @xmath98 is adopted .",
    "this suggests that there might be a high density core with low velocities in sn1998bw where the @xmath4-rays deposit efficiently .",
    "such a dense core could be formed in spherically symmetric models if the exploding star had a massive he envelope so that a strong reverse shock was formed at the c+o / he interface and largely decelerated the inner core as found in sn ib models ( hachisu et al .",
    "1991 , 1994 ) .",
    "however , the apparent absence of the he i lines in the optical spectra in sn 1998bw ( patat et al .",
    "2000 ) is not consistent with the presence of such a massive he envelope .",
    "also late time energy input from @xmath2co bubbles might create a non - homologous structure .",
    "however , the energy from radioactive decays is much smaller than the large explosion energy of sn  1998bw ( @xmath99 ergs ) , so that its effect is negligible .",
    "we suggest that the peculiar density distribution is the result of a non - spherically symmetric explosion . if the outburst in sn1998bw took the form of a prolate spheroid , for example , the explosive shock was probably strong along the long axis , ejecting material with large velocities and producing abundant @xmath2ni , which might have caused the early bright light curve . in directions away from the long axis , on the other hand , oxygen would not be consumed , and the density could be high enough for @xmath4-rays to be trapped even at advanced phases , thus giving rise to the slowly declining tail .",
    "these features can be seen in the hydrodynamical models of jet - like explosions ( maeda et al . 2000 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; khokhlov et al .",
    "1999 ; nagataki et al .",
    "the fact that the late light curve is fitted by model co138e7 with 0.28 @xmath0 of @xmath2ni , while the early light curve requires as much as 0.4 @xmath0 , could also support this suggestion , and point at the geometrical ratio between the extension of the high- and low - density regions .",
    "there are several observations which support the above non - spherical explosion scenario .",
    "the observed polarization ( @xmath100% ) of the early optical light ( patat et al .",
    "2000 ; imn98 ) suggests that the ejecta of sn  1998bw is aspherical .",
    "the observed abnormal distribution of elements in velocity space as seen in the emission line profiles in the nebular phase , with significant amounts of o being located at lower velocity than fe ( patat et al .",
    "2000 ; danziger et al . 1999",
    "; nomoto et al . 2000 ) can better be explained if the explosion is non - spherically symmetric ( maeda et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the possible connection between sn  1998bw and grb980425 also supports the conjecture that sn  1998bw was aspherical .",
    "the energy of the photons produced by synchrotron emission at the relativistic shock is approximately given by @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 ( piran 1999 ) , where @xmath104 is the lorentz factor of the shock and @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) is the density of the interstellar matter . in order to produce an observable grb",
    ", @xmath104 should be as large as @xmath107 .",
    "however , even the most energetic model ( co138e50 ) has only a very small mass of relativistic ejecta ( @xmath108 with @xmath109 ) , although relativistic hydrodynamical calculations are necessary to obtain the accurate mass .",
    "such a small amount of relativistic material , which is consistent with previous estimates ( imn98 ; woosley et al .",
    "1999 ) , is not enough to produce grb980425 in a spherically symmetric model .",
    "however , if the explosion is axi - symmetric , for instance , the energy can be carried by only a small fraction of the material , which might then attain a large lorentz factor .",
    "regarding asphericity , we note that danziger et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and mazzali et al .",
    "( 2000b ; see also nomoto et al .",
    "2000a ) estimated a @xmath2ni mass of 0.35 - 0.65 @xmath0 from the nebular lines of fe of sn  1998bw .",
    "this estimate does not depend much on the asphericity , and is in good agreement with the @xmath2ni mass of the spherical models co138 . on the other hand , hflich et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that the @xmath2ni mass can be as small as 0.2 @xmath0 if aspherical effects are large .",
    "because the difference between these results is not so large , aspherical effects might be modest in sn  1998bw .",
    "if the @xmath2ni mass could be determined more accurately from the late observations , it would provide a good measure of the degree of the asphericity .",
