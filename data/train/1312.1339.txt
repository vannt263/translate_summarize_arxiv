    "we have been monitoring the central region of m31 for the last @xmath913 years with _",
    "chandra _ , averaging @xmath91 observation per month , in order to discover x - ray transients .",
    "promising examples are followed up with two _ hst _ acs observations , the first is taken a few weeks after outburst , and the second observation is taken @xmath96 months later ; this allows us to identify the counterpart via difference imaging ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references within ) .",
    "we summarized the results of the first 12 transients ( labeled t1t12 ) found via this effort in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we study cxom31 004252.457 + 411631.17 , referred to hearafter as t13 .",
    "we discovered t13 in the 2013 june , 5ks chandra acis observation of the m31 center , @xmath995@xmath0 from the m31 nucleus ( m31 * ) @xcite .",
    "we obtained 92 net source photons , insufficient for spectral modeling ; however , the transient was likely to be in one of two spectral states , and we estimated the luminosity for both states . assuming a 1 kev disk blackbody model with line - of sight absorption equivalent to 7@xmath10 h atom @xmath11 yielded a 0.310 kev luminosity of 6.1@xmath10.6@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 @xcite ; this corresponds to a black hole binary in a thermally dominated state @xcite . a power law emission model with spectral index 1.7 yielded a 0.310 kev luminosity of 8.9@xmath10.9@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 @xcite ; this corresponded to a black hole binary in its low state @xcite .",
    "hence , the two possible spectral states for t13 yielded rather similar 0.310 kev luminosities .",
    "we found that the locale of t13 was serendipitously observed in one of our earlier hst observations , meaning that we only required one new hst observation .",
    "x - ray transients within the central region of m31 are most likely to contain a low mass secondary , as the majority of stars there are old .",
    "low mass x - ray binaries may be transient x - ray sources due to instabilities in their accretion disks ; the disk has two stable phases ( hot and cold ) , and an unstable intermediate phase matter accumulates in the disk in the cold phase , and is rapidly dumped onto the compact object in the hot phase ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the x - rays produced by accretion from the hot disk prevent the disk from cooling ; the x - ray luminosity decays exponentially if the whole disk is ionized , and linearly if only part of the disk is ionized @xcite .",
    "@xcite found an empirical relation between the ratio of x - ray and optical luminosities of galactic x - ray binaries and their orbital periods , suggestive that the optical emission is dominated by reprocessed x - rays in the disk ; this relation holds over a 10 magnitude range in optical luminosity , and appears to be insensitive to inclination .",
    "their chosen x - ray band was 210 kev .",
    "for an irradiated accretion disk with radius @xmath12 , x - ray luminosity @xmath13 , optical luminosity @xmath14 , and temperature @xmath15 , t@xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath13/@xmath18 , while the surface brightness of the disk , @xmath19 , @xmath17 t@xmath20 for typical x - ray binaries @xcite . since @xmath14 @xmath17 @xmath21 , @xmath14 @xmath17 @xmath22 ; also @xmath12 @xmath17 @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the orbital period .",
    "@xcite defined @xmath25 = @xmath26 , choosing @xmath27 = 2.5@xmath28 erg s@xmath3 as a normalizing constant , and found @xmath29 however , @xcite sampled a mixture of neutron star and black hole binaries , in various spectral states .",
    "a cleaner sample was obtained by a. moss et al .",
    "( 2013 , in prep ) , who used only black hole transients at the peaks of their outburst , and found @xmath30 we note that these two relations only differ significantly in normalization , caused by black hole x - ray binaries having larger disks than neutron star binaries with the same period .",
    "we have period estimates for 12 m31 transients ( t1t12 ) observed by _",
    "chandra _ and _ hst _ @xcite .",
    "t13 is particularly interesting because of its close proximity to m31*. @xcite found an excess of xbs within @xmath9100@xmath0 of m31 * when they compared the surface density of xbs with the stellar mass as traced by the k band light .",
    "they proposed that these excess binaries could be formed dynamically in the bulge of m31 , as seen in globular clusters .",
    "they noted that the stellar velocities in the bulge are considerably higher than in globular clusters , and concluded that surviving dynamically - formed xbs in the bulge would likely have a black hole primary and / or a very short period .",
    "t13 could be just such a system , meaning that its existence could provide strong support for the theory proposed by @xcite .",
    "we have observed t13 twice with chandra , and once more with hst .",
    "furthermore , we were granted an @xmath98 ks xmm - newton observation as part of the target of opportunity ( too ) program . in this paper",
    "we present our analysis of the chandra , hst , and xmm - newton data .",
    "we observed t13 in two 5 ks chandra acis observations , on 2013 june 2 ( c1 , obsid 15324 , pi murray ) , and 2013 july 24 ( c2 , obsid 15326 , pi murray ) .",
    "we observed t13 in outburst for 4.8 ks with hst / acs wfc using the f435w filter on 2013 june 18 ( h2 , jc6b01010 , pi barnard ) ; we also serendipitously observed t13 in quiescence during our 4.7 ks , 2007 january 10 hst / acis observation in the same configuration ( h1 , j9ju06010 , pi garcia ) .",
    "additionally , we were granted an @xmath98 ks xmm - newton observation on 2013 july ( x1 , 0727960401 , pi n. schartel ) using the thin filter .",
    "our analysis of the chandra and hst data follows the procedures outlined in @xcite .",
    "we extracted spectra from our x - ray observations of t13 using the appropriate mission - specific software suites : ciao v.4.4 for c1c2 , and _ xmm - newton _",
    "sas v.13.0.0 for x1 .",
    "we used the caldb version distributed with ciao .",
    "spectral analysis was performed with xspec v12.8.0 m .      for each of our _ chandra _ acis observations",
    ", we extracted source and background 0.37.0 kev spectra from circular regions with 2.5@xmath0 radii .",
    "we then created the appropriate response files ( response matrix and ancilary response file ) .",
    "the source spectra were grouped to give a minimum of 20 counts per bin .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations often experience intervals of greatly increased background levels .",
    "we searched for such flaring intervals by creating a lightcurve using the expression `` ( pattern==0)&&(pi in [ 10000:12000])&&(flag==0 ) '' and 100 s bins ; this observation was flare - free .",
    "we extracted a 0.310 kev source spectrum from a circular region with 240 pixel radius , to avoid contamination from a nearby source .",
    "a circular background region was chosen to be near the source , on the same chip , and at a similar off - axis angle ; its radius was 550 pixels .",
    "these spectra were filtered by the expression `` ( pattern@xmath7=4)&&(flag==0 ) '' .",
    "we also obtained a corresponding response files .",
    "the source spectrum was grouped to a minimum of 20 counts per bin .",
    "we used 27 x - ray bright globular clusters ( gcs ) to register a combined @xmath9300 ks acis image ( supplied by z. li ) to the b band field 5 image of m31 provided by the local galaxy group survey ( lgs ) @xcite .",
    "we used pc - iraf v2.14.1 to perform the registration , following the same procedure as described in @xcite .",
    "this yielded 1@xmath8 position uncertainties of 0.11@xmath0 in r.a .",
    ", and 0.09@xmath0 in dec @xcite .    similarly , we registered c1 to the merged _ chandra _ image using a selection of bright x - ray sources .",
    "the final uncertainties in the x - ray position of t3 combine the position uncertainties in the x - ray image , the uncertainties in registering observation c1 to the merged _ chandra _ image , and the uncertainties in registering the merged _ chandra _ image to the m31 field 5 lgs image .",
    "the uncertainties in registering the _ hst _ observation were negligible .",
    "all optical analysis was performed with pc - iraf revision 2.14.1 , except where noted .",
    "each _ hst _",
    "observation included four flat - fielded ( flt ) images , and one drizzled ( drz ) image .",
    "we used the drz images from h1 and h2 to create a difference image ; however , we used the h2 flt images for our aperture photometry because the software used ( daophot ) prefers images in that format .",
    "we reprojected the h2 drz image into the coordinates of the h1 drz image , to produce an accurate difference image ; see @xcite for further details . to do this , we first registered the h1 and h2 images to the lgs field 5 image , using unsaturated stars that were close to the target ; the uncertainties were negligible .",
    "then , we reoriented the h2 image to match the h1 image .",
    "the difference image was produced by subtracting h1 from h2 .      for h2 we used the daophot package released with iraf to obtain the net source counts in the flt images , for a total of @xmath31 counts over @xmath15 seconds .",
    "we converted this to vega @xmath5 magnitude via @xmath32 + 25.77,\\ ] ] following @xcite .",
    "we can convert from @xmath5 magnitude to @xmath33 via @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the line of sight absorption ; ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "the x - ray position of t13 included final 1@xmath8 uncertainties of 0.19@xmath0 in r.a .",
    "and 0.14@xmath0 in dec .",
    "figure  [ diffim ] shows a detail of the difference image overlaid with an ellipse that represents the 3@xmath8 uncertainties in the x - ray position for t13 ; white objects are brighter during h2 ( during outburst ) than in h1 ( when t13 was in quiescence ) .",
    "we found no evidence for an optical counterpart .",
    "instead , we calculated the 4@xmath8 upper limit to the b magnitude of the counterpart by summing the total counts within a circle with 3 pixel radius for each flt image , and dividing by the total exposure time ; this radius corresponds to @xmath93 times the fwhm for the acs .",
    "we obtained @xmath9180,000 photons over @xmath94.8 ks .",
    "the 4@xmath8 upper limit was estimated to be 4@xmath36 , and equation  [ 4s ] yielded @xmath5 @xmath6 26.9 at the 4@xmath8 level .",
    "we obtained 1455 net source counts from the pn spectrum in x1 .",
    "this spectrum was thermally dominated , and well described by a 0.39@xmath10.02 kev disk blackbody , with line - of - sight absorption equivalent to 7.2@xmath11.5@xmath10 h atom @xmath37 , and @xmath38/dof = 60/65 .",
    "there was very little power above @xmath95 kev ; the @xmath90.35 kev spectrum is shown in figure  [ dbspec ] .",
    "we also applied a double thermal emission model ( disk blackbody + blackbody ) , for comparison with the soft states observed in neutron star binaries studied by lin et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2009 , 2012 ) .",
    "the best fit yielded a 0.29@xmath10.05 kev disk blackbody plus a 0.57@xmath39 kev blackbody , absorbed by 1.1@xmath10.3@xmath40 h atom @xmath37 ; this fit is show in figure  [ 2cspec ] .",
    "we have used the disk blackbody component in this double thermal model to identify 35 black hole candidates ( bhcs ) in m31 ; neutron star xbs exhibit soft spectra at luminosities @xmath413@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 , with disk blackbody temperatures @xmath61 kev in all cases , while all 35 bhcs inhabited a separate parameter space @xcite .",
    "we note that our measured disk blackbody temperature for t13 is 14@xmath8 below the limit for luminous neutron star xbs , and reject a neutron star accretor .",
    "the 0.310 kev unabsorbed luminosity for t13 was 4.0@xmath10.3@xmath42 erg s@xmath3 in x1 .",
    "therefore the x - ray to optical flux ratio was @xmath61250 , ruling out a foreground star .",
    "we conclude that t13 contains a black hole .",
    "if we assume the best fit disk blackbody model for x1 , then observations c1 and c2 exhibited 0.310 kev luminosities of 6.2@xmath10.6@xmath2 and 1.30@xmath10.16@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 respectively .",
    "we note that the luminosity for c1 is consistent with the luminosity that we previously obtained by assuming a 1 kev disk blackbody @xcite ; hence the luminosity appears fairly insensitive to the disk blackbody temperature .",
    "unfortunately , m31 was unobservable by chandra in the @xmath93 months before c1 , hence the start time of the outburst is uncertain ; the peak is likely to have been unobserved .",
    "transient decays are expected to be exponential while the whole disk is illuminated , or linear when the disk is only partially illuminated @xcite . @xcite examined galactic ns and bh transients with known orbital periods and peak 0.410 kev fluxes and established that they followed this expectation . from figure 1 of @xcite ,",
    "we only expect linear decay for systems with orbital periods @xmath4130 hr , assuming a 10 @xmath43 primary , and a peak luminosity of @xmath96@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "we find a period @xmath75 hr for t13 ( see next section ) ; hence , we expect the decay to be exponential for a @xmath44 bh .",
    "we present the 0.310 kev unabsorbed luminosity lightcurve for t13 in figure  [ toolc ] ; the chandra observations are represented by circles , while the xmm - newton observation is represented by a diamond .",
    "a downward arrow indicates the time that h2 occurred .",
    "time is quoted relative to c1 .",
    "we present the best linear and exponential fits ; the lightcurve actually looks more linear than exponential , which may point to an accretor that is significantly more massive than 10 @xmath43 .",
    "if the curve is basically exponential , then it has an e - folding time of @xmath937 days .",
    "since t13 appears to be a black hole transient in its high state , we estimated its orbital period using equation 2 ; this relation requires the 2.010 kev luminosity .",
    "c1 was the closest observation to h2 , with a separation of 15.4 days .",
    "since the optical counterparts of x - ray transients tend to decay 2.2 times more slowly @xcite , we expect our measured @xmath33 to be 17% fainter than at the time of c1 .    assuming a 0.39 kev disk blackbody , and @xmath35 = 7.2@xmath10 atom @xmath37 , the 2.010 kev luminosity of t13 during c1 was 4.7@xmath4 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "we estimate an orbital period @xmath75 h for t13 from our 4@xmath8 upper limit to the b band luminosity , not including uncertainties in equation 2 ; we used the 4@xmath8 limit to be consistent with the optical processing software .",
    "if we take the 3@xmath8 b band limit , @xmath5 @xmath6 27.2 , @xmath33 @xmath6 2.3 , and the orbital period is @xmath73 h. t13 appears to be the sort of system predicted by @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed chandra , hst and xmm - newton observations of a new x - ray transient ( t13 ) that appeared within 100@xmath0 of m31 * in 2013 june .",
    "we obtained a 4@xmath8 upper limit to the b band luminosity of @xmath5 @xmath626.9 ; this translates to an absolute v band magnitude @xmath62.0 .",
    "the chandra spectra did not yield sufficient counts for spectral fitting ; however , the xmm - newton pn spectrum yielded 1455 net source counts .",
    "the spectrum was well described by a 0.39@xmath10.02 kev disk blackbody .",
