    "the spin of spiral galaxies is believed to be generated by tidal torques operating in the early universe on the primordial material destined to form a galaxy ( peebles 1969 ; white 1984 )",
    ". a generic prediction of this theory is the existence of local correlations between galaxy rotation axes and the surrounding matter field ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; porciani et al .",
    "2002a , b ; navarro , abadi & steinmetz 2004 , hereafter nas04 ) .",
    "several observational studies ( helou & salpeter 1982 , flin & godlowski 1986 , garrido et al .",
    "1993 , nas04 ) have looked for a preferential spatial orientation ( or alignment ) of galaxy rotation axes with respect to their surrounding large - scale structures .",
    "these attempts have been focused on galaxies in the vicinity of the milky - way . our galaxy and its",
    "neighbours are embedded in a slab , the supergalactic plane ( de vaucouleurs 1953 ) , that extends out to several tens of megaparsecs from our galaxy .",
    "prior work has concentrated on detecting an excess of nearby galaxies whose rotation axes were approximately perpendicular to the normal to the supergalactic plane .",
    "the existence of such an alignment has been difficult to establish , with claims of detection but also claims of no convincing evidence for alignments ( dekel 1985 ) .",
    "a number of factors complicate the above analysis .",
    "for example , the direction of the rotation axis of a spiral galaxy requires knowledge not only of the position angle and inclination but also which side of the galaxy is closer to the observer .",
    "this latter information is known only for the closest galaxies to our own .",
    "this uncertainty , however , can be avoided if only edge - on or face - on galaxies are selected ( nas04 ) . in this case",
    ", the spatial orientation of the rotation axis lies in the sky plane ( edge - on case ) or points exactly towards or away from us ( face - on case ) . nevertheless , this approach has the disadvantage that it reduces significantly the sample size .",
    "a natural solution would be to explore the orientation of edge - on and face - on spiral galaxies in two - dimensional large - scale distributions of galaxies beyond the supergalactic plane . to explore the alignment of the galaxies with respect to their surrounding matter",
    "it is necessary to characterize the spatial orientation of the cosmic sheet ( or plane ) at the position of the galaxy .",
    "this can be done by estimating the direction of the minor axis of the sheet at that point .",
    "this minor axis is , however , very difficult to measure in practice because of redshift - space distortion : peculiar velocities not associated with the hubble flow that prevent us from deriving to obtain the true three dimensional arrangement of the galaxies .",
    "consequently , the detection and characterization of large - scale sheet - like distributions of galaxies in the redshift - space is ill defined . in this paper",
    "we present an alternative way of exploring preferential spatial orientations without resorting to the detection of planes .",
    "we concentrate our analysis on galaxies located on the shells of the largest cosmic voids ( r@xmath0@xmath110 h@xmath2 mpc ) .",
    "we adopt a cosmological model with h@xmath3=100 h km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath4=0.3 and @xmath5=0.7 .",
    "the gradient of the density field at points around large voids shows a strong tendency to be aligned with the direction of the vector going from the centre of the void to those points .",
    "so , any departure from isotropy of the distribution of the angle between the galaxy plane and the local `` sheet '' shall be inherited by the distribution of the angle @xmath6 between the galaxy `` spin '' @xmath7 and the vector joining the galaxy with the centre of the corresponding void @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "thus , @xmath6 can be easily determined as :    @xmath9    when the galaxy lies in the shell of a large void , the vector @xmath8 can be approximated by the vector joining the centre of the void to the centre of the galaxy . if the position of the void centre is @xmath10 and the position vector of the galaxy is @xmath11 , then @xmath8 is simply : @xmath8=@xmath11-@xmath10 . to evaluate the spin vector @xmath7 of a galaxy we need to know its position angle , @xmath12 , its semi - minor to semi - major axis ratio , b / a , and its coordinates ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) .",
    "we define the inclination angle as : @xmath15 .    in our definition",
    ", @xmath12 increases anticlockwise from north to east in the plane of the sky .",
    "so , if we consider a galaxy characterized by angles ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath12 , @xmath16)=(0,0,0,0 ) ( i.e. an edge - on galaxy along the z axis ) , the spin of this galaxy should be @xmath17=(0,1,0 ) .",
    "therefore , the spin @xmath7 of a generic galaxy can be computed as the following product : @xmath7=m(@xmath13 , @xmath14 ,",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath16)@xmath17 where m(@xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath12 , @xmath16 ) is the transformation matrix which considers all the rotations for the four angles . if we denote r@xmath18(@xmath12 ) as the rotation matrix of angle @xmath12 around the axis q , then we have that : m(@xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath12 , @xmath16)=r@xmath19(-@xmath13)r@xmath20(-@xmath14)r@xmath21(@xmath12)r@xmath19(@xmath16 ) . introducing the explicit expressions for the rotation matrices and substituting the value of m",
    ", we find :    @xmath22    the above set of equations toguether with @xmath8 give us all the information necessary to evaluate @xmath6 .",
    "however , it is worth noting that , in the determination of @xmath16 , the two valued arcsin provides us with 2 values for the inclination angle : @xmath23 ( i.e. we are not able to decide whether the spin is pointing _ towards us _ or _ away from us _ ) . to avoid this problem we had to constrain our analysis to edge - on ( or",
    "face - on ) galaxies , i.e. those with @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 ) . in practice , our sample considered galaxies with b / a@xmath260.208 ( or b / a@xmath270.978 ) , which implies that @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) .    to achieve a sizeable sample of large voids we have used the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al . 2001 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) . to characterize the uncertainty of the angle @xmath6 we have used 2dfgrs and sdss galaxy redshift survey mocks constructed from a set of large , high - resolution cosmological n - body simulations ( cole et al .",
    "these simulations do not resolve detail on the scale of a galaxy so we have assumed for this test that all the galaxies were edge - on with the position angle of the rotation axis uniformly distributed in the sky plane .",
    "we measured the difference between the angles @xmath6 estimated in real space and in redshift space .",
    "we find that this difference is well described by a gaussian distribution with standard deviation of 10@xmath30 .",
    "in addition , these simulations allow us to estimate the uncertainty at measuring the centre position of the voids as @xmath312.5 h@xmath2 mpc .",
    "this uncertainty is smaller than the uncertainty in estimating the position for individual galaxies : @xmath314.2 h@xmath2 mpc , because the central position of the void is determined using a large number of galaxies in the shell .",
    "the 2dfgrs and sdss ( data release 3 ) catalogues give photometric and spectroscopic information for hundreds of thousands of galaxies .",
    "the 90% redshift completeness limit of the 2dfgrs is reached at b@xmath32=19 mag and at b@xmath32=18.8 mag in sdss ( norberg et al . 2002 ) .",
    "if we wish to maximizing the volume and the number of galaxies under exploration the above magnitude limits imply that we must estimate the central position of the voids using all galaxies brighter than m@xmath33=-19.32 + 5log(h ) with z@xmath340.14 in the 2dfgrs and z@xmath340.13 in the sdss .",
    "the number of voids that we detect with radius larger than 10 h@xmath2 mpc is : 239 ( 2dfgrs ) and 756 ( sdss ) .",
    "the detection and size estimation of the voids was performed with the hb void finder ( patiri et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "once the largest voids are obtained we select all the edge - on and face - on galaxies within the shells r@xmath0@xmath34r@xmath34r@xmath0 + 4 h@xmath2 mpc surrounding the voids . as mentioned before ,",
    "we consider a spiral galaxy edge - on if the ratio of semi - minor to semi - major axis is less than 0.208 .",
    "this restriction removes from our sample spheroidal galaxies but leaves with a small residue from close galaxy pairs that was eliminated by checking all the galaxies individually by visual inspection .",
    "face - on galaxies are selected if the ratio of semi - minor to semi - major axis is greater than 0.978 .",
    "the face - on selected sample is contaminated by round spheroidal galaxies that are removed by visual inspection .",
    "this last step can only be achieved in the sdss since the 2dfgrs survey lacks good quality image resolution allowing the visual classification of the galaxies .",
    "consequently , we only used edge - on galaxies in the 2dfgrs sample .    to avoid edge biasing in our results",
    "we then removed all the above voids that do not satisfy the condition that their radii plus the radius of the shells are fully contained within the survey area .",
    "this leaves with 149 ( 2dfgrs ) and 321 ( sdss ) voids .",
    "the number of voids which contain at least one edge - on / face - on spiral in their shells are 49 ( 2dfgrs ) and 129 ( sdss ) .",
    "the final number of galaxies we analyse is 60 ( edge - on ; 2dfgrs ) , 118 ( edge - on ; sdss ) and 23 ( face - on ; sdss ) .",
    "as expected by projection effects the number of face - on galaxies is much smaller than the number of edge - on galaxies .",
    "the total number objects in our sample is 201 .",
    "for each of these galaxies we derived the angle @xmath6 between the rotation axis and the local void wall orientation as explained above .",
    "the observed probability density distribution of the angle @xmath6 is shown in fig .",
    "2a shows the result of a test placing the centres of the voids randomly within the survey volume .",
    "the number of edge - on galaxies and their distances to the centre of these voids are similar in this control experiment than in the real case .",
    "as expected no signal is detected . when using the centres of the real voids , both in the sdss ( fig .",
    "2b ) and 2dfgrs ( fig .",
    "2c ) surveys , the distribution follows a similar trend , although the distribution for the 2dfgrs is significantly noisier due to the smaller number of objects .",
    "the combined sample is shown in fig .",
    "2d . the rotation axes of the galaxies tend to lie in the plane parallel to the surface of the void ( i.e. the angles @xmath6 are predominantly large ) .",
    "we have used three different statistics to test the rejection of the null hypothesis ( i.e. that the orientation of the galaxies is randomly distributed ) : the departure of the average ( avni & bahcall 1980 ) of sin(@xmath6 ) from 0.5 ( i.e. the expected value in the null hypothesis case ) , the kolmogorov - smirnov test and the @xmath35-test .",
    "the three statistics agree in the rejection of the null hypothesis at @xmath3699.7% level ( @xmath37 test : 99.7% ; ks test : 99.6% and @xmath35-test : 99.8% ) when the full galaxy sample ( fig .",
    "2d ) is considered . for consistency with the 2dfgrs data we have checked whether removing the face - on galaxies from the sdss survey affects our conclusion . as expected because of the small number of face - on galaxies the signal only decreases very slightly ( @xmath360.1% ) when these objects are removed and the main conclusion ( i.e. the rejection of the null hypothesis ) remains unchanged .    in fig .",
    "2d we show the comparison of our results with lee s recent analytic evaluation ( lee 2004 ) of the galaxy inclinations within the framework of the tidal torque theory .",
    "the strength of the intrinsic galaxy alignment of the galaxies with local shears at present epoch is expressed as the following quadratic relation ( lee & pen 2002 ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the galaxy spin vector and @xmath40 is the rescaled traceless shear tensor @xmath41 defined as @xmath42=@xmath43 with @xmath44@xmath45@xmath46 , and c is a correlation parameter introduced to quantify the strength of the intrinsic shear - spin alignment in the range of [ 0,1 ] .",
    "the best agreement with the theory is obtained when lee s correlation parameter c is 0.7@xmath47 .",
    "when c=1 the strength of the galaxy alignment with the large - scale distribution is maximum , whereas c=0 implies galaxies are oriented randomly .",
    "it is worth noting that the value of c measured in this work is a lower limit of the true value because it has been evaluated without any attempt to correct for redshift distortion .",
    "consequently , the strength ( and statistical significance ) of the observed alignment in true three dimensional space should be higher .",
    "because of lack of resolution , using present - day n - body simulations what one can predict is the intrinsic alignment of underlying dark halos rather than that of the observable luminous parts of the galaxies .",
    "although the standard theory of galaxy formation assumes that the rotation axes of the luminous parts align with those of the dark halos , it was implied by recent hydrodynamical simulations that the luminous components could conserve the initial memory of the intrinsic shear - spin correlation better that the dark matter components ( nas04 ) .",
    "interestingly , our best - fit value of c=0.7 is @xmath272 times higher than that found in n - body simulations ( lee & pen 2000 ; lee , kang & jing 2005 ) .",
    "this reinforces the idea that the luminous parts of the galaxies tend to keep the initial memory of the surrounding matter better than their dark matter counterparts .",
    "finally , the positive detection of alignments between galaxies and their surrounding matter shown in this work would explain one of the most intriguing galaxy properties : the tendency of satellite galaxies to avoid orbits coplanar with their host spiral galaxies ( an effect known as the `` holmberg effect '' ) ( holmberg 1969 ; zaritsky et al .",
    "1997 ; sales & lambas 2004 ) .",
    "as we have shown , the rotation axes of the galaxies preferentially lie on the sheets , consequently , the satellite galaxies that are accreted through the filaments will populate mainly polar orbits .",
