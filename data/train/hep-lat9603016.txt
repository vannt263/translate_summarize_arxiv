    "whether we wish to compute the mass spectrum of lattice qcd or the phase structure of the extended hubbard model , we are faced with the same problem  extracting physics from a theory to which conventional perturbative methods can not be applied . to date , the most popular approach to these problems has been monte carlo evaluation of the feynman path integral .",
    "recently , we introduced an alternative , hamiltonian - based approach called the core ( contractor renormalization group ) approximation@xcite and applied it to the case of the 1 + 1-dimensional ising model . in this paper , we significantly extend the method and simplify its implementation .",
    "the core approach defines a systematic , nonperturbative , and computable means of carrying out a hamiltonian version of the kadanoff - wilson@xcite real - space renormalization group transformation for lattice field theories and lattice spin systems .",
    "the method relies on contraction and cluster expansion techniques .",
    "the core approximation improves upon other methods of implementing approximate real - space renormalization group transformations on hamiltonian systems@xcite in several ways .",
    "first , our methods make it possible to define a _ gauge - invariant _ renormalization group transformation for any abelian or nonabelian lattice gauge theory , something which was not possible in earlier schemes .",
    "second , it is no more difficult to treat fermions than bosons when one uses these methods .",
    "third , it is easy to add a chemical potential to the hamiltonian for a system such as the hubbard model in order to tune the density of the ground state , a difficult feat in earlier hamiltonian real - space renormalization group schemes .",
    "finally , core allows us to map a theory with one set of degrees of freedom into a theory described in terms of a very different set of degrees of freedom but possessing the same low - energy physics . within the context of lattice gauge theories , this means we can start from a theory of quarks and gluons and map it into a system in which the effective degrees of freedom have the quantum numbers of mesons and baryons .",
    "computing such a transformation within the hamiltonian framework was not possible in earlier methods .",
    "in addition to the above qualitative improvements , there are also substantial quantitative refinements . for example , earlier attempts to compute the ground - state energy density and other properties of the @xmath0-dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet using previous real - space renormalization group methods@xcite or @xmath1-expansion techniques@xcite had difficulty matching the accuracy of andersons@xcite naive spin - wave approximation . we will demonstrate that the core approximation significantly improves on anderson s calculation without making any large spin approximations .",
    "another example which we discuss is the @xmath0-dimensional ising model . we will show that an easily implemented core computation substantially improves upon results from earlier methods .",
    "we close this section with a brief review of the renormalization group ( rg ) in order to contrast the core method to previous rg implementations .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : rules ] , we state without proof the rules for carrying out a core calculation .",
    "we then illustrate the method in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] by applying the rules in four examples : free scalar field theory with single - state truncation , the heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin chain with two - state truncation , the anisotropic ising model with two - state truncation , and free scalar field theory with an infinite - state truncation scheme .",
    "the rules are then derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : derive ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : converge ] , two issues are discussed : the use of approximate contractors , to establish the connection of the core approach to earlier methods ; and the convergence of the cluster expansion , to demonstrate the need for summation via the renormalization group . finally , future applications to the hubbard and extended hubbard models and lattice gauge theory with and without fermions are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : looking ] .",
    "we also address the issue of relating the contractor renormalization group to the familiar perturbative renormalization group in @xmath2 theory .",
    "physical systems in quantum field theory and statistical mechanics involve a large number of degrees of freedom and can usually be described in terms of a local hamiltonian .",
    "conventional wisdom says that when the coherence length of such a system is small , the properties of the system depend strongly on the form and strengths of the interactions in the hamiltonian ; whereas , when the coherence length is large , many degrees of freedom behave cooperatively and the properties of the system are governed primarily by the nature of this cooperation with the detailed form of the hamiltonian playing only a subsidiary role .",
    "the renormalization group@xcite , as formulated by kadanoff and wilson , is generally thought of as a method for treating systems in which the coherence length encompasses many degrees of freedom . this method is based on iteratively _ thinning _ the degrees of freedom in the problem , an approach which is similar to that followed in hydrodynamics wherein the innumerable microscopic degrees of freedom are replaced by a much smaller set of spatially - averaged , macroscopic variables , such as the density and pressure . in this renormalization group method ,",
    "the thinning is achieved via a sequence of renormalization group transformations .",
    "while the original formulation of the rg method was done for the partition function or its path - integral analogue in field theory , the approach has been extended to hamiltonian systems .",
    "the basic idea is to construct a real - space renormalization group transformation , @xmath3 , which maps the hamiltonian @xmath4 of a theory defined on some lattice @xmath5 to a new theory @xmath6 defined on a _ coarser _ lattice @xmath7 in such a way that the new theory has the _ same low - energy physics _ as the original theory . to extract the low energy physics of the original theory",
    ", we repeatedly apply the transformation @xmath3 and generate the sequence of _ renormalized hamiltonians : _",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "this sequence usually approaches a fixed point of @xmath3 , that is , a hamiltonian @xmath12 satisfying @xmath13 .",
    "each renormalized hamiltonian in this sequence possesses the _ same _ low - energy physics , but the degrees of freedom have been _",
    "thinned_. eventually , the number of remaining degrees of freedom lying within the coherence length will be small and the resulting hamiltonian will be more amenable to solution .",
    "generally , the same transformation @xmath3 is used for each iteration ; however , this is not required .",
    "the use of different transformations for each iteration is clearly impractical , but the use of a different transformation for the first one or few steps could be a powerful generalization of the method , facilitating great simplifications .",
    "a quantum field theory could be mapped into a generalized spin model ; qcd could be mapped into a theory of interacting hadrons .",
    "defining and carrying out the thinning transformations is the key to the rg approach .",
    "the rg transformation @xmath3 is usually defined by requiring invariance of the partition function or its path - integral analogue in field theory .",
    "the rg method exactly describes the low - lying physics as long as @xmath3 can be exactly implemented , which is rarely the case . in practice",
    ", approximations must be made , such as those made in the @xmath14-expansion @xcite , the use of perturbative matching as in the heavy - quark effective field theory@xcite and nonrelativistic qcd@xcite , and stochastic estimation as in the monte carlo renormalization group@xcite approach .",
    "the core approach is a new and powerful method for defining @xmath3 and computing @xmath15 which relies on contraction and cluster techniques . in contrast to other methods ,",
    "the approximations made in the core approach do not limit the usefulness of the method to any restricted range of coupling constants or other parameters in the theory .",
    "the core approach works well not only near a critical point when the coherence length is large , but also in instances where it is small .",
    "it is a general method for solving any lattice hamiltonian problem .",
    "core computations begin by defining the way in which the new lattice is _ coarser _ than the original lattice .",
    "we begin by partitioning the lattice into identical blocks .",
    "the hilbert space of states corresponding to each block is then _ truncated _ by discarding all but a certain number of low - lying states ; we generally retain enough states so that the truncated degrees of freedom on a block resemble those of a site on the original lattice .",
    "the _ renormalized _ or effective hamiltonian @xmath16 in this truncated space of states is then defined in terms of the original hamiltonian @xmath17 by @xmath18 \\ ! ] ^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\ [ \\ ! [ t(t)\\ h    \\ t(t ) \\ , ] \\ ! ] \\ [ \\ ! [ \\",
    ", t(t)^2 \\ , ] \\ ! ] ^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } ,   \\label{hamren}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the _ contractor _ and @xmath20\\ ! ] $ ] refers to truncation to the subspace of retained states .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the eigenvalues of the renormalized hamiltonian and the low - lying eigenvalues of the original hamiltonian . in general",
    ", the renormalized hamiltonian can not be exactly determined ; core approximates @xmath16 using a finite cluster expansion , an approximation which can be systematically improved .",
    "matrix elements of various operators can also be evaluated in core by defining a sequence of renormalized operators .",
    "we use the phrase `` core technology '' to refer to the set of tools which allow us to systematically and nonperturbatively compute an arbitrarily - accurate approximation to the exact renormalization group transformation for a lattice field theory or spin system without having to diagonalize the original infinite - volume theory .",
    "the power of these methods is that usually only a few terms in the cluster expansion of the renormalized hamiltonian yield remarkably good results .",
    "in this section , we state , without proof , the rules for carrying out a core computation .",
    "we assume that we are studying a theory defined by a local hamiltonian @xmath17 on a regular lattice of infinite extent in some number of dimensions .    a core computation proceeds as follows :    1 .",
    "first , divide the lattice into identical , disjoint blocks @xmath21 .",
    "denote the space of states associated with block @xmath21 by @xmath22 and denote the common dimension of each of these spaces by @xmath23 .",
    "2 .   define a truncation scheme by selecting a low - lying subspace @xmath24 of dimension @xmath25 on every block ; the same subspace should be chosen on each block . in what follows , we will denote the @xmath26 retained states by @xmath27 and use them to construct the projection operators @xmath28 let @xmath29 \\ ! ] $ ] denote truncation to the subspace spanned by the taking tensor products of the states @xmath27 .",
    "thus , for any operator @xmath30 , the truncated operator is defined as @xmath31 \\ ! ] = p^\\dagger op$ ] .",
    "note , choosing to retain states such that the truncated degrees of freedom on a single block resemble those associated with a single site on the original lattice ensures that the renormalized hamiltonian will take a form similar to that of the original hamiltonian , facilitating the iteration process ; however , sometimes it is useful to make a different choice and map the original theory into one formulated in terms of new degrees of freedom .",
    "3 .   compute ( see below ) the renormalized hamiltonian defined in eq .",
    "[ hamren ] , @xmath32 , and the renormalized operators corresponding to any matrix elements of interest .",
    "4 .   repeat the above steps using @xmath33 to obtain @xmath34 .",
    "iterate this process until the renormalized hamiltonian is simple enough that its low - lying eigenvalues can be determined .    because the hamiltonian is _ extensive _ ( a concept we will define later ) and the block - by - block truncation preserves this property",
    ", the renormalized hamiltonian can be approximated using the finite cluster method ( fcm ) .",
    "this method was first used by domb@xcite in the application of the mayer cluster integral theory to the ising model . a formal proof of the method in the ising and heisenberg models was then presented by rushbrooke@xcite .",
    "the method was later generalized by sykes _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the finite cluster method expresses any extensive quantity in an infinite volume as a sum of finite - volume contributions .",
    "the procedure is simple to implement and provides numerous means of detecting computational errors .",
    "a general statement of the method can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "evaluation of @xmath16 by the finite cluster method is accomplished in the following sequence of steps :    1 .",
    "compute the renormalized hamiltonian for a theory defined on a sublattice which contains only a single block @xmath35 ( how this is done will be described below ) .",
    "denote this hamiltonian by @xmath36 .",
    "this yields all of the so - called range-1 terms in the cluster expansion of the renormalized hamiltonian .",
    "2 .   calculate the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath37 for a theory defined on a sublattice made up of two adjacent ( _ connected _ ) blocks @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",
    "the range-2 contributions to the cluster expansion of the renormalized hamiltonian on the infinite lattice are obtained by removing from @xmath37 those contributions which arise from terms already included in the single block calculation : @xmath39 3 .",
    "repeat this procedure for sublattices containing successively more connected blocks .",
    "for example , for a sublattice consisting of three adjacent blocks @xmath35 , @xmath38 , and @xmath40 , use @xmath41 since the renormalized hamiltonian is extensive , only connected sublattices need to be considered . recall that a quantity is extensive if , when evaluated on a disconnected sublattice , it is the sum of that quantity evaluated separately on the connected components of the sublattice",
    ". a truncated cluster expansion can then be defined by neglecting clusters larger than some specified range .",
    "4 .   to complete the determination of the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath16 on the infinite lattice , sum the connected contributions @xmath42 from the finite sublattices according to their embeddings in the full lattice . for example",
    ", on an infinite one - dimensional lattice : @xmath43 express @xmath16 in terms of block - variables such that the form of @xmath16 resembles that of the previous hamiltonian in the rg sequence .",
    "the key ingredient of core is the method used to explicitly construct the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath44 and other renormalized operators on a given cluster or sublattice @xmath45 .",
    "while , in principle , the appropriate generalization of eq .",
    "[ hamren ] completely specifies what has to be done , in practice , an attempt to compute this quantity by brute force will run into problems since the operator @xmath46 $ ] becomes singular as @xmath47 . to see how this problem arises ,",
    "consider a sublattice comprised of @xmath48 connected blocks @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 denote the hamiltonian obtained by restricting the infinite lattice @xmath17 to the sublattice @xmath45 and suppose that we truncate to the subspace @xmath51 spanned by the @xmath52 states @xmath53 .",
    "remember that the states @xmath53 are tensor products of the retained states on each of the @xmath48 blocks in the cluster @xmath45 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath54 the eigenstates of @xmath50 with eigenvalues @xmath55 and expand the states @xmath53 in terms of these eigenstates : _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath56 it then follows that @xmath57 from which we see that all states @xmath53 which have a nonvanishing overlap with the ground state of @xmath50 contract onto the same state as @xmath47 .",
    "this causes great difficulties if we attempt to numerically compute @xmath58^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "fortunately , there is an elegant and simple solution to this problem which avoids explicit computation of @xmath59^{-1/2}$ ] : make a unitary ( or orthogonal ) change of basis , @xmath60 , on the states @xmath53 such that each state in the new basis contracts onto a unique eigenstate of @xmath50 . in this new basis , the computation of @xmath44 is then straightforward .",
    "the discussion which follows specifies the rules for computing the necessary change of basis and @xmath44 for a general @xmath50 .",
    "we state these rules in full generality so as to allow for the special situation in which @xmath50 has degenerate eigenvalues , and then apply them to successively more complicated examples in order to show how they work in practice .",

    "this means that computing the action of @xmath438 on @xmath372 can do well at approximating the ground - state energy density and still fail to reproduce the mass gap .",
    "second , we observe that for finite values of @xmath456 , there is a finite @xmath1 which yields a best estimate of the ground - state energy density .",
    "@xmath438 does a very good job of approximating @xmath449 for smaller values of @xmath1 , so at first , @xmath482 tends towards the ground state of @xmath17 ; however , @xmath477 eventually begins to move away from the ground - state wavefunction and so the expectation value of the energy density starts to get worse .",
    "this shows that without additional improvements , working with @xmath438 for finite @xmath456 and a _ best _ @xmath1 can not be expected to always accurately reconstruct the infrared properties of the theory .",
    "the renormalization group method works better than simply evaluating the action of @xmath438 on a single state because it eliminates only the higher states which @xmath438 reproduces well and carries the more difficult long - wavelength modes over to the next step of the calculation .",
    "the agreement between the results of our earlier core treatment of the ising model which used @xmath491 and a best value of @xmath1 and our current @xmath492 and @xmath493 calculation supports this picture .",
    "we now return to the heisenberg antiferromagnet and compute the vacuum energy density using two different single - state truncation procedures .",
    "there are two reasons for doing this : first , to show that computing the ground - state energy density for an infinite - volume theory from a series of finite - volume calculations is generally applicable ; second , we often learn more from examples which do not work as expected than from ones which work well . in this case",
    ", we will learn that partitioning the lattice into either two- or three - site blocks can produce sequences of truncated cluster expansions which converge at very different rates .",
    "we explain why this happens and show how the two - state truncation algorithm used earlier avoids these convergence problems .",
    "first , we apply a single - state rg algorithm in which the lattice is partitioned into two - site blocks and we retain only the lowest - lying eigenstate in each block .",
    "denote by @xmath134 the ground - state energy of the theory defined by restricting the full hamiltonian to an @xmath86-site sublattice .",
    "the two- , four- , six- , and eight - site ground - state energies are @xmath494 , @xmath495 , @xmath496 , and @xmath497 , and they yield the following connected contributions in the cluster expansion of the renormalized hamiltonian : @xmath498 thus , we obtain a sequence of approximations to the infinite - volume ground - state energy density from the following truncated cluster expansions : @xmath499 which are to be compared to the exact energy density @xmath500 .",
    "note that we divide by two in the above formulas so that our results refer to the energy per site of the original lattice instead of the energy per two - site block .",
    "for this simple truncation algorithm , the finite - range cluster expansion converges rapidly and agreement with the exact answer to better than one percent is obtained with ease .",
    "given our earlier discussion of the free - field theory , it is interesting to compare the approximations built from connected terms to what we would obtain from simply dividing the ground - state energy for each @xmath456-site block by @xmath456 .",
    "the comparison of these results is presented in table  [ haftable ] .",
    "the better than one - percent agreement of the finite - range cluster expansion with the exact ground - state energy density brings into question the benefits of using the renormalization group algorithm .",
    "however , the need for the renormalization group becomes apparent after examining the sequence of approximations obtained using three - site blocks . in this case ,",
    "numerical diagonalization of the appropriate sublattice hamiltonians yields @xmath501 , @xmath496 , and @xmath502 , yielding connected contributions @xmath503 if we now use these results to construct the corresponding approximations to the energy density per site , we obtain the sequence @xmath504 which oscillates about the correct answer and converges much more slowly than that for the two - site decomposition of @xmath17 .",
    "the cause of this oscillation and slow convergence arises from the fact that the physical excitations of this model have integer spin ; the three - site decomposition has difficulty reproducing the low - lying physics since the ground state of the three - site block is a spin-1/2 multiplet , that of the six - site block is spin-0 , and the ground - state of the nine - site block is once again spin-1/2 .",
    "the two - site decomposition of the hamiltonian does not suffer from this effect .",
    "this lack of rapid convergence is very instructive ; since there is no way to know in advance what the correct spectrum of excitations is , this shows that we need a method for summing , at least partially , an infinite number of terms in the finite - range cluster expansion . as we saw in our earlier discussion of the antiferromagnet ,",
    "this is what the full renormalization group calculation allows us to do .",
    "this paper sets forth the basic rules for core computations , derives the rules from first principles , and discusses issues related to the convergence of the procedure .",
    "future papers will focus on the application of these methods to more interesting physical systems and on clarifying the connection of the core approach to perturbative methods in instances where both are applicable . some systems which should receive early attention are lattice gauge theories with and without fermions , t - j models@xcite , and extended hubbard models@xcite .",
    "it is important to study the application of core technology to lattice gauge theories in order to see if , as we believe , it provides a powerful alternative to monte carlo calculations for studying qcd and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "extended hubbard and t - j models are of interest because they are conjectured to have some relevance to high-@xmath505 superconductivity and have proven difficult to study in more than one spatial dimension by conventional methods . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the application of core methods to these problems and indicate how one could establish the connection between the core approach and a perturbative renormalization group treatment of @xmath2 theory .",
    "there are many ways to apply the techniques introduced in this paper to lattice gauge theories .",
    "one interesting approach is to divide the lattice into finite - size blocks , truncate the hilbert space associated with each block to a set of gauge - invariant states , and then use the renormalization group formalism to map the gauge theory into a system which , like a spin system , has only a finite number of states associated with each lattice site .",
    "this approach yields an `` equivalent '' hamiltonian theory in which all of the unphysical degrees of freedom have been eliminated .",
    "we can then treat the new hamiltonian in the same way as in the heisenberg and ising models .",
    "for example , we could associate with each _ plaquette _ of the original lattice a single _ site _ in the new lattice",
    ". we could then find the low - lying gauge - invariant eigenstates of the one - plaquette hamiltonian , either exactly or numerically , and truncate by selecting a finite number of these eigenstates .",
    "using this truncation procedure , we construct a renormalization group transformation which maps the gauge theory into a generalized `` spin '' system .",
    "the interactions between nearby `` spins '' are found by evaluating the renormalized hamiltonian on clusters containing several connected plaquettes .",
    "this new spin system would be guaranteed to have the same low - lying gauge - invariant physics as the original theory and could be treated in the same way as the heisenberg and ising models .",
    "this approach allows us to define and carry out a gauge - invariant renormalization group calculation for any lattice gauge theory .",
    "this ability to define a gauge - invariant , hamiltonian - based , real - space renormalization group calculation is unique to the core approach .",
    "earlier real - space renormalization group procedures also kept a finite number of states per block , but they defined the renormalized hamiltonian by @xmath506 $ ] , the truncation of the original hamiltonian to the subspace spanned by the retained states ( this corresponds to the @xmath507 limit of the core approach ) . in such calculations , keeping only gauge - invariant block states leads to a truncated hamiltonian in which the block - block interactions vanish . in order to retain inter - block couplings ,",
    "flux must move across the links joining the blocks ; this can not happen without keeping some gauge - noninvariant single - block states .",
    "however , if one keeps such states in the truncation procedure , the entire process becomes much more cumbersome .",
    "the question of how many single - block gauge - invariant states and how many terms in the cluster expansion of the renormalized hamiltonian should be retained naturally arises when carrying out a contractor renormalization group calculation ; each choice constructs a mapping of the original gauge theory into a different generalized spin system .",
    "we hope to answer this question in the future by carrying out several computations in a simple lattice gauge theory , such as 2 + 1-dimensional compact @xmath508 , varying the number of retained single - block states and clusters to see how quantities of interest , such as mass gaps and the specific heat , depend on these factors .",
    "interesting possibilities arise when we consider lattice gauge theories with fermions .",
    "one way of treating these theories is to study systems with either slac@xcite , wilson@xcite , or quinn - weinstein@xcite fermions and truncate the system to the subspace spanned by tensor products of gauge - invariant , single - site states . in the case of lattice qcd , this would include all color - singlet single - site states , _",
    "i.e. , _ mesons and baryons , which can be formed by applying quark and antiquark creation operators to the single - site vacuum state , subject to the constraints imposed by the exclusion principle .",
    "as the only terms which appear in the lattice qcd hamiltonian create ( or destroy ) closed loops of flux or move quarks from site to site trailing their flux behind them , the color - singlet mesons and baryons are all degenerate and the connected range-1 part of the renormalized qcd hamiltonian will vanish . in order to compute the connected range-2 terms ,",
    "we solve the problem of two sites connected by a single link and find the low - lying gauge - invariant eigenstates which have an overlap with all of the tensor products of the two sets of single - site meson and baryon states . this computation yields connected range-2 contributions to the renormalized hamiltonian which contain meson and baryon kinetic terms as well as meson - meson and meson - baryon interactions .",
    "connected range-3 terms come from computations involving three sites arranged in a straight line or forming a right angle .",
    "these range-3 terms contain corrections to the terms already described , new terms which allow mesons and baryons to hop along diagonals of the underlying lattice , and terms which describe three - site interactions .",
    "continuing in this way produces a renormalized hamiltonian expressed only in terms of the physical degrees of freedom ; the underlying quarks and gluons disappear from the problem .",
    "we would now like to say something about how chiral symmetry breaking will show up in qcd with three flavors of quarks and either slac or quinn - weinstein fermion derivatives ( the case of wilson fermions is somewhat different ) .",
    "consider a theory with three massless flavors of quarks and apply a more restrictive truncation procedure which keeps only single - site fluxless states containing equal numbers of quarks and antiquarks , _",
    "i.e. , _ mesons . for three flavors of quarks",
    "there are @xmath509 such states and , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , they form an irreducible representation of the group @xmath510 where the group generators are formed from bilinears in the single - site quark fields @xmath511 . note that for @xmath512 flavors , the fluxless states form an irreducible representation of the group @xmath513 . for a truncation algorithm based upon keeping gauge - invariant single - site states , the renormalized hamiltonian contains no range-1 connected terms .",
    "the first nonvanishing contribution to the renormalized hamiltonian will be the range-2 connected terms and these are computed by solving the two - site theory .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that if we keep only the nearest - neighbor terms in the fermion derivative , then the resulting hamiltonian is invariant under a global @xmath510 , and since the two - site problem can not have anything but nearest - neighbor terms , this observation can be used to simplify the computation of the connected range-2 terms in the renormalized hamiltonian .",
    "we already noted that the fluxless single - site states form an irreducible @xmath509-dimensional representation of @xmath510 and so tensor products formed from these states can be decomposed into the irreducible representations of @xmath510 which appear in the product of two @xmath509 s ; these are the only states in the full problem relevant to our core computation . starting from the highest weight state in each of these irreducible representations and applying the lanczos method",
    ", we can numerically find the relevant eigenvalues of the two - site hamiltonian to a high degree of accuracy . from general symmetry arguments ,",
    "the most general two - site hamiltonian one can write for this system will be in the form of a finite polynomial in the casimir operator and higher order invariants formed out of the generators of @xmath510 .",
    "thus , the general structure of the connected range-2 hamiltonian will be given by @xmath514 it is a simple exercise to show that in the strong - coupling limit , the leading term in this expansion is the one proportional to @xmath515 ; in other words , in strong - coupling , the renormalized range-2 hamiltonian is just a generalized heisenberg antiferromagnet . as was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    ", we expect this theory to spontaneously break to @xmath516 , where the vector @xmath517 is realized normally and the axial - vector @xmath518 is realized in the goldstone mode .",
    "thus , in the strong - coupling limit , the connected range-2 part of the renormalized hamiltonian unavoidably leads to a spontaneously broken symmetry , but the group is too large and there are too many goldstone bosons . clearly , a detailed calculation is necessary to determine if these conclusions persist in weak coupling where other terms in eq .",
    "[ rangetwoqcd ] can become significant .",
    "however , we can show that the problems of having too large a symmetry group and too many goldstone bosons disappears once we compute the connected range-3 terms .    to see this ,",
    "observe that , independent of the coupling constant , the next - to - nearest - neighbor terms in both the slac and quinn - weinstein types of derivative break the @xmath510 symmetry and , after including these terms in the renormalized hamiltonian , all that remains of the @xmath519 symmetry of the nearest - neighbor theory is @xmath520 . as in the discussion of the range-2 terms",
    ", we can invoke the strong - coupling limit to calculate the structure of the leading range-3 terms and explicitly show that the range-3 terms give the unwanted goldstone bosons mass and that the degenerate @xmath521 multiplets of mesons break up into @xmath522 multiplets .",
    "this is in strict analogy to what was discussed in ref .",
    "of course , as we noted for the case of the range-2 terms , the generic structure of the connected range-3 terms in the renormalized hamiltonian is richer than that of the leading terms in the strong coupling limit , and so asserting that this pattern of symmetry breaking persists to the physically more interesting weak - coupling regime requires more work than we have done to this point .",
    "much interesting work remains to be done in this picture of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ; nevertheless , the fact that the core procedure provides a coupling - independent way of constructing an effective theory of mesons which , in the strong - coupling limit , coincides with earlier descriptions in which dynamical chiral symmetry breaking appears naturally , is new and unique to this approach .      among the interesting features of the hubbard and extended hubbard models are the variety of phase transitions which can occur as the density of particles in the ground state changes .",
    "while tuning the density of particles in the ground state is easily accomplished by adding a chemical potential to the hamiltonian , early attempts to analyze these theories using naive real - space renormalization group methods ran into problems : projecting onto a small number of states per block so that the occupation number of each state is a finite integer , and therefore the density a rational fraction , made it difficult to achieve a smooth dependence of the density on the chemical potential .",
    "core mitigates this problem without having to keep a large number of states per block : first , the connected range-@xmath86 terms are computed by diagonalizing the full @xmath86-site hamiltonian , including the chemical potential , and so these terms can encode more complicated behavior of the chemical potential coefficient @xmath523 ; second , the operator which measures the density of particles in the ground state as a function of @xmath523 undergoes a much more complicated evolution than it does in a naive truncation procedure , evolving connected range-@xmath86 terms of its own .",
    "preliminary computations support this picture but more extensive computations are needed to fully explore the potential of core methods for this class of problems .      in this section",
    ", we discuss the way in which one could establish the relationship between the core approach and the familiar perturbative renormalization group in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "to illustrate this connection , consider adding a @xmath524 interaction to the scalar field theory hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "[ bosefreefield ] , where the @xmath277 coupling is small , and again apply the core procedure outlined in sec .",
    "[ freebose ] .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to include the @xmath2 term and perturbatively compute the core transformation associated with the two - site , infinite - state truncation procedure .",
    "we begin with the same truncation procedure defined for the free - field case and keep the same tower of oscillator states for each two - site block .",
    "a new feature is that we must now compute @xmath130 and @xmath330 even for the range-1 terms because the retained states contract onto states which are different from the two - site , free - field eigenstates and the eigenenergies corresponding to these states are also changed from their free - field values .",
    "a direct consequence of this is that the new range-1 connected part of the renormalized hamiltonian contains higher - order polynomials in the fields . given a perturbative expression for the connected range-1 terms , we have to perturbatively solve the four - site problem to compute @xmath130 and @xmath330 in order to obtain the connected range-2 terms in the renormalized hamiltonian . once again , we get a set of terms of the form @xmath525 which do not correspond to terms in the original hamiltonian .",
    "longer - range connected terms are computed in the same manner .",
    "since the zero - coupling limit of this procedure builds up a finite - range expansion of the free - field theory , one should be able to make this perturbative expansion match up with more familiar renormalization group computations .",
    "there is a simple way to modify the procedure just outlined so as to automatically resum the perturbative expansion of the renormalized hamiltonian to very high order in the coupling .",
    "one virtue of this modified approach is that it guarantees that the ground - state energy density will behave as @xmath526 for large couplings .",

    "note that this minimization process guarantees that the state @xmath529 is the lowest - lying eigenstate of the `` free hamiltonian '' obtained by keeping the quadratic terms , including those which come from normal ordering the quartic self - interaction . since @xmath530 and @xmath322 are nontrivial functions of @xmath528 and @xmath277 , the perturbation theory just described amounts to an infinite resummation of the usual expansion .",
