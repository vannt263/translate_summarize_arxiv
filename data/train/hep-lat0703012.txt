    "lattice qcd , the only known first principle non - perturbative approach to qcd , has made a dramatic progress in the last decade because of the increasing power in the computing resources and the improvement of the numerical algorithms for the simulations .",
    "today fully dynamical lattice qcd simulations together with effective theories enable one to make first principle predictions of hadronic physics .",
    "recently , a so - called mixed - action lattice simulation using different kind of fermions in the valence and sea sectors has gained attention because these simulations can reach the pion masses as low as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in particular , despite the controversy of the validity of the fourth root trick used to overcome the fermion taste doubling problem of the staggered fermions , the lattice calculations using ginsparg - wilson valence quarks in staggered sea quarks has become popular because many quantitative results are obtained @xcite .",
    "further , the publicly available milc configurations @xcite have encouraged the use of lattice calculations with dynamical staggered fermions .    the lattice action can be described by symanzik action  @xcite which is based on the symmetries of the underlying lattice theory and can be organized in powers of the lattice spacing @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the contribution from dimension-@xmath6 operators .",
    "the symmetries of the lattice action are respected by the symanzik lagrangian @xmath7 order - by - order in @xmath3 . in order to address lattice spacing corrections , based on the symanzik action",
    ", several mixed - action chiral perturbation theories are developed to investigate the systematic errors which arise from lattice simulations due to the non - vanishing lattice spacing @xcite .",
    "these mixed - action chiral perturbation theories provide a way to test the results from the lattice calculations using the mixed lattice action and vice - versa .",
    "the nucleon axial charge , @xmath8 , is an important quantity in qcd which quantifies the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "since its value is known to a very high precision in experiments @xcite , it can be used as a very good test for the first principle lattice calculations .",
    "this quantity of hadronic physics has been studied extensively in both lattice simulations and chiral perturbation theory .",
    "although to perform the lattice simulations to calculate @xmath8 is straightforward , some controversy remains .",
    "for example , the @xmath8 obtained from lattice simulations has raised the controversy of the possibility of large volume effects in the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "recently , using the mixed - action of domain wall valence quarks with staggered sea quarks , @xcite obtained a nice result of @xmath8 which seems to match nicely with the prediction from chiral perturbation theory and it is expected that the future data might be able to make contact with experiment via extrapolation . on the other hand , in @xcite , the discretization errors in computing @xmath8 using the mixed - action might be overlooked . with the advent of mixed - action @xmath9pt @xcite and extension to the baryon sector @xcite ,",
    "it is surprising that lattice spacing effects on the nucleon axial charge have not been addressed . in this paper",
    "we address this issue mentioned above , namely , we use the mixed - action chiral perturbation theory to study the lattice - spacing dependence of @xmath8 . in particular , we found that it depends on the unphysical low energy constant @xmath10 and a new unknown lec for which the actual value must be obtained from lattice calculations .",
    "this paper is organized as follow . in section @xmath11 , we briefly review the chiral perturbation theory of ginsparg - wilson valence quarks in staggered sea . in particular , we will put emphasis on the lattice - spacing @xmath3 dependence of the mixed - action lagrangian .",
    "next , in section @xmath12 , we will construct the axial - vector current from the mixed - action lagrangian and compute the @xmath13 matrix element of the axial - vector current .",
    "further we will compare the results obtained in the presence and absence of lattice - spacing @xmath3 .",
    "finally we conclude in section @xmath14 . for completeness",
    ", we include some standard functions which arise in this calculation in the appendix .",
    "to address the finite lattice spacing issue , with the pioneering work in @xcite , @xcite have extended the @xmath9pt in the meson sector .",
    "this finite lattice spacing artifacts has also be investigated in staggered @xmath9pt for the mesons @xcite and the mixed - action pq@xmath9pt @xcite . to address the finite lattice spacing effects ,",
    "one utilizes a dual expansion in the quark masses and lattice spacing with the usual energy scale @xcite : @xmath15 and the following power counting scheme @xcite : @xmath16 which is relevant for current improved staggered quarks simulations .    in this section ,",
    "we briefly introduce the chiral perturbation theory of the partially - quenched mixed - action theory .",
    "in particular , we focus on the mixed - action of ginsparg - wilson valence quarks in staggered sea quarks .",
    "we only write the chiral lagrangian of the associated mixed - action theory and do not go into the detail of how this chiral lagrangian can be constructed from the symanzik lagrangian since the detail of the procedure can be found in the references cited above . for our purpose in this paper , we only need to keep in mind that @xmath17 and the taste - symmetry breaking and @xmath18 breaking operators will not enter at the order we calculate the axial - vector current matrix element @xcite .      in the following",
    ", the strange quark mass is assumed to be fixed to its physical value , therefore one can use two - flavor theory and does not need to worry about the extrapolation in the strange quark mass .",
    "the lattice action we consider here is built from @xmath11 flavors of ginsparg - wilson valence quarks and @xmath11 flavors of staggered sea quarks . in the continuum limit ,",
    "the lagrangian is just the partially quenched lagrangian which is given by : @xmath19 where the quark fields appears as a vector @xmath20 with entries given by : @xmath21 and transforms in the fundamental representation of the graded group @xmath22 .",
    "notice the fermion doubling has produced four tastes for each flavor @xmath23 of staggered sea quark .",
    "the partially quenched generalization of the mass matrix @xmath24 in the isospin limit is given by : @xmath25 with @xmath26 as the @xmath14 x @xmath14 taste identity matrix .",
    "the low - energy effective theory of the theory we consider above is written in terms of the pseudo - goldstone mesons emerging from spontaneous symmetry breaking which are realized non - linearly in an @xmath27 matrix exponential @xmath28 @xmath29 to the order ( next - to - leading order ) we work in investigating the @xmath0-dependence of the matrix element of the axial - vector current between nucleons , the relevant partially - quenched chiral perturbation theory lagrangian for the mesons up to order @xmath30 is given by :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 @xmath33  mev , the str ( ) denotes a graded flavor trace and @xmath28 is defined in ( [ sig ] ) .",
    "the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath9 are matrices of pseudo - goldstone bosons and pseudo - goldstone fermions , for example , see .",
    "the potential @xmath36 contains the effects of dimension-@xmath37 operators in the symanzik action @xcite . expanding the lagrangian in eq .   to the leading order",
    ", one can determine the meson masses needed for the calculations of baryon observables .",
    "in particular , the relevant mesons needed for the axial - vector current matrix element calcualtions are the valence pion , mesons made of @xmath38 with one staggered sea quark @xmath39 of flavor @xmath40 and quark taste @xmath41 and a ginsparg - wilson valence quark @xmath42 and finally mesons with two staggered quarks in a flavor - neutral , taste - singlet combination .",
    "the associated masses to the lowest order for the latter two mesons can be written in terms of the valence pion mass @xmath43 which can be determined from the valence spectroscopy and the pseudoscalar taste pion mass @xmath44 which the mass can be learned from the milc spectroscopy and are given by : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the parameters in the potential @xmath36 .",
    "since these masses are independent of the quark taste , we do not specify the taste index in ( [ qmass ] ) .",
    "notice the flavor singlet field @xmath48 is rendered heavy by the @xmath49 anomaly and can been integrated out in .",
    "however , the propagator of the flavor - neutral field deviates from a simple pole form @xcite . since",
    "only the valence - valence flavor - neutral propagators are needed for our later calculations , for @xmath50 , the leading - order @xmath51 propagator in the isospin limit is given by : @xmath52 one can further show that these propagators can be conveniently rewritten in a compact form which will be useful in our later calculations : @xmath53 where @xmath54 \\label{eq : hpsdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in writing ( [ eq : hpsdef ] ) , we have used @xmath55 .      as has been shown in @xcite , to @xmath30 , the free lagrangian for the @xmath56-dimensional super - multiplet @xmath57 and the @xmath58-dimensional super - multiplet @xmath59 fields in the mixed - action @xmath22 partially quenched @xmath9pt has the same form as in quenched and partially quenched theories with the addition of new lattice - spacing dependent terms : @xmath60 the baryon potentials @xmath61 and @xmath62 in ( [ eqn : l ] ) arise from the operators in @xmath63 of the symanzik lagrangian . in the baryon lagrangian",

    "the lagrangian describing the interactions of the @xmath57 and @xmath59 with the pseudo - goldstone mesons in the mixed - action is again the same as in the partially quenched theories with a new @xmath0-dependence term : @xmath66 + a^2 \\cl^{(6)}_{int } \\ ,     \\label{interl } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the axial - vector and vector meson fields @xmath67 and @xmath68 are defined by : @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "the effective axial - vector current from @xmath75 can be obtained by a simple argument . the parameters that appear in the mixed - action  lagrangian",
    "can be related to those in  by matching .",

    "we point out that with @xmath120 , the mass square corrections to the @xmath140 and @xmath141 mesons are around @xmath142 to @xmath143 which implies that @xmath98 at @xmath139 on the figure is effectively similar to that obtained at @xmath144 with @xmath121 . therefore a large correction is no suprise . by reducing the lattice spacing @xmath3 to @xmath145 , which might be the standard lattice spacing in future simulations , the correction is around @xmath146 .",

    "we see with @xmath120 , @xmath98 receives a @xmath152 percent correction at @xmath151 .",
    "this observation shows that the lattice spacing effects on @xmath8 of current related simulations should not be overlooked and that it is not clear whether @xmath9pt can be reliably used to account precisely for lattice spacing effects .",
    "however , with lattice spacing @xmath153 , we observe a reasonable @xmath154 percent correction to @xmath98 at @xmath155 .",
    "we also point out that there is an unphysical parameter @xmath135-dependence in ( [ eq : npaxial1 ] ) even in the unquenched limit .",

    "the mixed - actions provide us with a powerful tool in lattice simulations because they enable one to use different type of fermions in the valence and sea sectors .",

    ", we found that the @xmath13 axial - current matrix element depends on the lattice spacing via three parameters , namely , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and finally a new low energy constant @xmath117 . the low energy constant @xmath156 affects the masses of mesons made from a ginsparg - wilson quark and a staggered quark .",
    "its physical value can be fixed either from mixed meson masses or the pion charge radius @xcite .",
    "further , the combination of parameters @xmath47 has been already constrained from staggered meson lattice data @xcite .",
    "the new low energy constant @xmath117 , on the other hand , can be evaluated from the lattice simulations of determining the nucleon axial charge @xcite .",

    "ideally , this low energy constant @xmath117 will be more accurately determined if a variety of lattice spacings in the lattice simulations are available .",
