    "the observable behavior of circumstellar dust particles under the influence of gravity and radiation pressure can provide information on the locations and masses of unseen planets ( see , for example , @xcite ) . a particularly suitable object for study",
    "is the a0 star vega at 7.76 pc whose disk is seen nearly face - on , as suggested by the low inclination ( @xmath4 ) of the stellar rotation axis @xcite .",
    "images at 850 @xmath0 m and 1.3 mm @xcite indicate a partial dust ring ( @xmath5 au ) dominated by two unequal clumps interpreted as collisional debris from resonantly - trapped planetesimals . more recent observations with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) @xcite have revealed an extensive halo representing small ( @xmath6 @xmath0 m ) and medium - sized ( @xmath7 @xmath0 m ) grains blown out from the ring by radiation pressure , the ring itself being dominated by large grains of radii @xmath8 @xmath0 m .    dynamical modeling shows the spatial distribution of the ring to be consistent with the 2:1(u ) resonance of a neptune - mass planet which has undergone migration @xcite .",
    "such a model predicts the existence of other populated resonances ( for example 3:2 and 4:3 ) , the detection of which would help confirm the model and provide new constraints .",
    "we present new observations at 350 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m which bear on this issue .",
    "vega was observed at 350 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m with the sharc ii camera @xcite at the nasmyth focus of the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) on ut 2004 sep 1719 ( 350 @xmath0 m ; @xmath9 ) , 2005 apr 23 ( 350 @xmath0 m ; @xmath10 ) , and 2005 jun 1113 ( 450 @xmath0 m ; @xmath11 ) , where @xmath12 represents the zenith value of atmospheric optical depth .",
    "the on - source total integration times were 5.0 hr , 2.7 hr and 9.7 hr , respectively . similarly to our fomalhaut observations @xcite , the telescope was scanned in an oscillatory fashion in azimuth and elevation with peak - to - peak amplitudes of @xmath13 .",
    "the vega images were generated with an iterative code (  sharcsolve \" ) similar to crush . to reduce spatial @xmath14 noise in the center of the image , the sky intensity was forced to be zero beyond @xmath15 from the star ( analogous to spatial chopping with amplitude @xmath16 in all directions ) , except for the final iteration which allowed non - zero intensities outside @xmath15 radius for noise - evaluation purposes . after the application of gaussian smoothing ( with a kernel of 55 fwhm ) , the angular resolutions ( fwhm ) of the output images were 97 and 111 , at 350 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "absolute calibration was accomplished with hourly , interspersed observations of point sources , and is based on assumed neptune fluxes of @xmath17 and 86.5 jy in 2004 and 2005 , respectively , and @xmath18 jy .",
    "we estimate 1@xmath19 calibration accuracies of 30% and @xmath20 in absolute flux and pointing , respectively .",
    "the flux error includes the effect of subtraction of the slowly - varying background ( @xmath21% level over spatial scales of a few tens of arcseconds at both wavelengths ) .",
    "the point source response function ( psf ) was obtained from observations of mars at 350 @xmath0 m and neptune at 450 @xmath0 m , rotated and coadded to recreate the rotational smearing due to changing parallactic angle .",
    "the nonzero angular diameters of those planets ( 35 and 23 , respectively ) broadened the estimated psfs by 6% and 2% , respectively ; the effect on subsequent processing was found to be negligible within prevailing errors .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the observed images at 350 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m , before and after subtracting the estimated photospheric contributions of 35 mjy and 21 mjy , respectively .",
    "the integrated flux densities of vega ( before photospheric subtraction ) , within a circular aperture of @xmath22 radius , at 350 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m are @xmath23 mjy and @xmath24 mjy , respectively .",
    "the observed images show clearly the ring morphology of the vega disk , and suggest inhomogeneous structure .",
    "figure 2 shows the 350 @xmath0 m intensity variation as a function of azimuth , calculated in an annulus of inner and outer radii 69 and 139 , respectively .",
    "three peaks are apparent , at azimuths of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , with amplitudes of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 above the local mean level respectively , where @xmath19 represents the statistical measurement noise .",
    "we have mapped the line - of - sight optical depth ( relative column density of dust ) in the vega disk as a function of 2-d location in the disk plane using the diskfit procedure @xcite , assuming in this case a geometrically - thin face - on disk .",
    "the output , referred to as a  tau map , \" is estimated using a set of observed images at multiple wavelengths , taking full account of the corresponding psfs .",
    "it is assumed that the local temperature of each dust grain component is determined by the energy balance of individual grains in the stellar radiation field using the results of @xcite .",
    "the current version of the code makes simultaneous estimates of the tau maps corresponding to the different grain components , each of which is characterized by the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath31 represents the wavelength above which the grains radiate inefficiently and has an approximate correspondence with the grain radius , @xmath33 , and @xmath32 is the power - law index of the wavelength dependence of opacity such that @xmath34 .",
    "the spatial resolution of the tau maps exceeds that of the raw images due to implicit deconvolution of the psfs .",
    "tau maps were made using data at three wavelengths , by combining our 350 & 450 @xmath0 m images with a 70 @xmath0 m mips image at the fine ( @xmath35 ) pixel scale .",
    "we employed a two - grain model consisting of the 18 @xmath0 m grains which dominate the 70 @xmath0 m emission @xcite and a population of larger grains whose size was chosen based primarily on the observed spectral slope between 350 @xmath0 m and 70 @xmath0 m . specifically , assuming @xmath36 @xcite , the spectral slope implies @xmath37 k for the larger grains ; if we further assume a size - temperature dependence corresponding to the grain composition ( silicate - carbon mix ) used by @xcite in their vega modeling , we obtain @xmath38 @xmath0 m . since this limit was based on the extremes of the flux error bars and of the relative contributions of ring and halo at 70 @xmath0 m , we have adopted a larger value ( 1 mm ) as being more likely to be representative of the grains reponsible for 350/450 @xmath0 m emission .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig3 ] , which shows tau maps for the two grain components ( 18 @xmath0 m and 1 mm ) separately and also the total optical depth ( lower panel )",
    ". superposed on the latter , for comparison , are the positions of previously - reported emission peaks from longer wavelength data at 850 @xmath0 m and 1.3 mm @xcite .",
    "the tau map for 1 mm grains shows inhomogeneities , the reality of which we have assessed using a @xmath39 test based on fits to the 350 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m data .",
    "specifically , an azimuthally - uniform ring resulted in a 10% increase in @xmath39 relative to an unconstrained tau map ; taking into account the number of independent data points ( 255 ) , this translates into a relative probability @xmath40 corresponding to a @xmath41 deviation .",
    "we therefore conclude that the azimuthal structure we see in the ring is at the 4@xmath195@xmath19 significance level , consistent with our findings based on the @xmath42 of peaks in the observed 350 @xmath0 m image ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the tau map for 18 @xmath0 m grains is dominated by a ring of larger scale ( @xmath43 au ) than for the 1 mm grains ( @xmath44 au ) .",
    "there is also lower - level diffuse structure masked by surrounding noise spikes , the latter resulting from the radial increase in tau estimation error corresponding to decreasing dust temperature .",
    "we can , however , smooth out these fluctuations with azimuthal averaging to show the underlying diffuse structure .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the result in the form of radial profile plots of the 1 mm grain component ( filled circles ) and the 18 @xmath0 m grain component ( open circles ) .",
    "the error bars reflect the tau map estimation errors after a @xmath45 reduction from azimuthal averaging in annuli of width 17.5 au .",
    "it is apparent that for @xmath46 au , the radial falloff in column density of 18 @xmath0 m grains is consistent with the @xmath47 variation reported by @xcite .",
    "inside 200 au , however , some of these grains may be concentrated in the the ring structure , but the proportion is subject to model uncertainties related to the larger grain component .",
    "the observations show qualitatively different appearance of the vega dust ring at 350/450 @xmath0 m and @xmath48 @xmath0 m . furthermore , the 850 @xmath0 m flux ( 23 mjy ) predicted by our tau map accounts for only a fraction of either of the published values of 850 @xmath0 m flux , which are @xmath49 jy @xcite and 91 mjy ( @xcite , as quoted by @xcite ) . the observations can ,",
    "however , be reconciled using a model in which the ring emission at 350/450 @xmath0 m is dominated by 1 mm grains with a @xmath50 opacity law , and the emission longward of 850 @xmath0 m is dominated by an additional component of much larger grains with flat spectral opacity ( @xmath51 ) ; the latter would require grain sizes of at least a centimeter @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the 850 @xmath0 m image ( with its single dominant peak at @xmath52 in position angle ) has been attributed to dynamical effects , the most important of which is the 2:1(u ) resonance of a neptune - mass planet 65 au from the star @xcite .",
    "those calculations also show that other resonances are present , principally 3:2 and 4:3 , the latter of which shows a 3-fold spatial symmetry consistent with what we see at 350/450 @xmath0 m . in this regard",
    "we note that for a planet of given mass , the requirement that the dust grains not be dislodged from resonance by radiation pressure sets a lower limit , @xmath53 , to the grain size @xcite . for a neptune - mass planet orbiting vega ( luminosity @xmath54 ; mass @xmath55 ) , wyatt s expression",
    "leads to @xmath56 @xmath0 m , consistent with our choice of @xmath57 mm for the tau maps .    based on the 850 @xmath0 m data alone",
    ", an ambiguity exists for the orbital direction of the planet , shown counterclockwise in figure 15(b ) of @xcite .",
    "but if our identification of the 350/450 @xmath0 m structure with the 4:3 resonance is correct , then the ambiguity is resolved ; the planet is then located diametrically opposite to the star from the se clump in our figure [ fig3 ] and its orbit is clockwise . the predicted locations of the 4:3 resonance peaks are then given by the arrows in figure [ fig2 ] , which are in substantial agreement with observation .",
    "it would then remain to explain why the cm - sized grains ( seen at 850 @xmath0 m ) and mm - sized grains ( seen at 350/450 @xmath0 m ) exhibit two different resonance patterns .",
    "we note , however , that the analysis by @xcite suggests that the dust has been released during a relatively recent event , most likely the collision of two planetesimals .",
    "this being the case , our results could be understood if the two planetesimals involved were located in the 4:3 resonance , and that the collision released smaller particles than the ones which were there before , thus affecting the 350/450 @xmath0 m appearance much more than that at 850 @xmath0 m .",
    "the 4:3 resonance is , in fact , a relatively likely place for a collision to occur , since the collision timescale decreases with decreasing orbital semimajor axis , and hence is shorter in the 4:3 resonance than in 2:1 .",
    "we have simulated this scenario with dynamical modeling based on a neptune - mass planet at 65 au , assuming orbital parameters similar to @xcite , and further assuming that the 4:3 resonance is populated by smaller grains ( 1 mm ) than the other resonances ( 1 cm ) .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "comparison of the predicted 350 @xmath0 m and 850 @xmath0 m images with the observations ( figure [ fig1 ] of this paper and @xcite , respectively ) shows that the model successfully accounts for the wavelength dependence of the observed structure .",
    "our analysis therefore suggests that different resonances can be populated by grain populations of different sizes , depending on the collisional history of the planetesimals .",
    "this means that the dust distribution does not necessarily mimic the planetesimal distribution as assumed by @xcite .",
    "it will thus be important to confirm the detection of the 4:3 resonance and constrain the grain sizes involved using future observations at multiple wavelengths .",
    "this work was performed by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
