    "at about 470 pc , the orion nebula is one of the nearest massive star formation regions .",
    "it is part of the giant molecular complex of orion , that has been revealed by the @xmath2co maps of kutner ( 1977 ) .",
    "the co map of maddalena ( 1986 ) has shown the global distribution of gas in the orion - monoceros complex .",
    "this dense region of the interstellar medium , extending over approximatively 30 degrees from southeast to northwest , is composed of several distinct areas .",
    "the most northern part is the gaseous region distributed on a circle around @xmath3 orionis . to the south ,",
    "the orion giant molecular clouds a and b extend over 15 degrees from north to south . to the southeast",
    "are located monoceros and the southern filament .",
    "this set of giant molecular clouds is located 150 pc below the galactic plane , and might have been formed by the collision of a cloud falling from the southern galactic hemisphere onto the galactic disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "these molecular clouds are associated with large hii regions , the orion ia , ib , ic ob star associations , located on a 15 degree long ridge on the side away from the galactic plane .",
    "the orion nebula is part of the orion a giant molecular cloud , and its best studied region . behind this h ii region",
    "is the omc-1 molecular cloud , which corresponds to a co emission peak .",
    "this cloud is heated by the ultraviolet radiation of the ob stars of the trapezium cluster ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "one can distinguish inside of omc-1 , two intense infrared sources : the ponctual object of becklin - neugebauer ( @xcite ) and , 10 arcseconds to the south , the kleinmann - low nebula ( @xcite ) that has an angular diameter of about 30 arcseconds .",
    "it is thought that bn is a young massive star ( 25 ) with an important mass loss .",
    "the first far infrared observation towards m42 has been performed by low & aumann ( 1970 ) in the spectral range from 30 @xmath0 to 1000 @xmath0 .",
    "then harper ( 1974 ) mapped m42 at 90 @xmath0 and showed that the infrared emission originates from a more extended region .",
    "this area has been since intensively studied , from optical radiations to radio wavelengths ( see for example the review of @xcite ) .",
    "north from omc-1 , one can clearly see an extended `` integral - shaped '' filament ( isf hereafter ) with two denser regions called omc-2 and omc-3 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these cores have been studied both in molecular lines ( recent studies of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and continuum ( recent works of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the 1300 @xmath0 maps of omc-2 and omc-3 of chini ( 1997 ) have shown the precise filamentary structure of these regions , studying several sources inside .",
    "on the dense ridge , the three cores omc-1 , omc-2 , omc-3 have active star formation and seem to have been formed at roughly the same time .",
    "however there are important differences between them .",
    "omc-1 has massive star formation and strong interactions between the gas and the infrared sources , increasing the gas temperature to @xmath4 70 k , whereas omc-2 is less luminous , contains low mass young stars and less energetic outflows than omc-1 .",
    "omc-3 is thought to have a mass comparable to omc-2 ( @xmath4 100 ) , but has less energetic outflows and lower gas temperature , suggesting that omc-3 is less evolved than omc-2 , itself being less evolved than omc-1 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the recent works in submillimeter continuum ( @xcite , @xcite ) have high angular resolution , and thus have clearly shown the complex structure of the orion integral - shaped filament and discovered small condensations , as also did the @xmath5 work of nagahama ( 1998 ) for the whole orion a cloud .",
    "however the continuum ground - based observations do not have the sensitivity to map the weak emission from the dust away from the dense ridge .",
    "a recent far - infrared balloon - borne observation of orion ( @xcite ) has derived the temperature distribution in orion , the coldest source they found being 15 k.    we have observed this region with the submillimeter balloon - borne telescope pronaos , in order to better understand the variations of temperature and spectral index of the dust , and to study the cold phase of the dense interstellar medium .",
    "pronaos provides simultaneous measurements within four bands covering the wavelength range 200 @xmath0 - 800 @xmath0 , allowing to constrain both the temperature and the spectral index of the dust , in order to derive column densities and masses .",
    "the high sensitivity per beam allows us to study the extended emission of the dust , in and a few parsecs away from the dense ridge .",
    "a first pronaos mapping of omc-1 and its surroundings has been analyzed by ristorcelli ( 1998 ) .",
    "they discovered a cold ( 12.5 k ) condensation and showed for four sources the variability of temperature and spectral index in the orion nebula complex .",
    "we present in this paper a detailed analysis of the submillimeter maps obtained towards orion with the second flight of pronaos in september 1996 , at fort - sumner , new mexico .",
    "we have observed a much larger region than in ristorcelli including the integral - shaped filament and other cold clouds , two being seen for the first time in continuum emission .",
    "section 2 deals with the observation performed , section 3 describes the maps obtained , and section 4 presents a detailed analysis of these maps .",
    "pronaos ( programme national dobservations submillimtriques ) is a french balloon - borne submillimeter experiment , with a 2 m diameter telescope ( @xcite ) . the main characteristics of the instrument are given in table 1 .",
    "the focal plane instrument spm ( systme photomtrique multibande , see @xcite ) is composed of a wobbling mirror , providing a beam switching on the sky with an amplitude of about 6 at 19.5 hz , and four bolometers cooled at 0.3 k. they measure the submillimeter flux in the spectral ranges 180 - 240 @xmath0 , 240 - 340 @xmath0 , 340 - 540 @xmath0 and 540 - 1200 @xmath0 , with sensitivity to low brightness gradients of about 1 in band 4 . thanks to an arrangement with dicroic filters , the measurement is performed simultaneously for all four bands on the same sky pixel . an off - axis star tracker and",
    "a 3-axis gyroscope allow to control the telescope pointing . before a flight ,",
    "the telescope and the whole payload are aligned and controlled .",
    "two internal black bodies are calibrated with an absolute reference .",
    "they provide in - flight calibrations with an accuracy of about 5 % ( relative ) , which has been checked against saturn .",
    "the measurements on saturn allow us to derive the beam shape up to a radius of six arcminutes from the axis .",
    "we use the integral of these beams to compare the saturn measurement to the ground based calibration which is performed on extended blackbodies filling the beam . regarding the ratio of the main central beam to the total beam , the beam efficiencies are from 0.78 in band 1 to 0.96 in band 4 .",
    "this can be expressed as a mean wave - front error of about 15 @xmath0 .",
    "more details about the instrument can be found in ristorcelli ( 1998 ) .",
    "the observing procedure is an altazimut scanning of the beam on the sky .",
    "the time - ordered data suffer thus from two main artifacts : the measured flux is differential , and the rotations of the telescope around the direction of observation distort the mapping pattern from a rectangular grid .",
    ".pronaos instrument characteristics [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we also show in table 5 the mass of each region .",
    "this is obtained simply by multiplying the estimated gas column density by the surface of the region , assuming a distance of 470 pc .    for the clouds separated from the molecular complex",
    ", we may reasonably ask if they can collapse due to their mass and therefore become protostellar objects . as an indicator of the stability of the clouds",
    ", we give in table 5 the jeans mass .",
    "we use for this the expression derived from the equality of gravitational and thermal energy ( @xcite ) :    @xmath6 = 10@xmath7 .",
    "t    with m@xmath9 in solar masses and @xmath10 the diameter in cm of the cloud .",
    "t refers in this equation to the gas temperature , whereas we used the dust temperature found . in the dense interstellar medium ,",
    "the two temperatures are weakly different ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we assume by this way that the mass is essentially the clump s one , and that the gas temperature of the clump is about the same as the dust one , but it may be different from the temperature of the supposed surrounding gas ( traced by the @xmath11co ) .",
    "the comparison of the cloud mass to the jeans mass is here to be taken as an indicator of the cloud s instability .",
    "there are of course large uncertainties in both the clump s measured mass and the non thermal sources of internal energy , such as magnetic field and turbulence , which can help to balance the gravitational energy . on the other hand ,",
    "external pressure may lead to stabilization of otherwise evaporating clumps . in our sample of four cold clouds",
    ", there is a trend that the clumps closer to the active region ( clouds 1 and 2 ) are potentially the more unstable .",
    "our study shows a large distribution of temperatures and spectral indexes in and around a dense and active molecular complex , the m42 orion nebula . the temperature varies from 12 k to 70 k , and the spectral index from 1.1 to 2.2 .",
    "the finding of two new cold clouds ( clouds 3 and 4 ) confirms that the existence of cold condensations in such regions is not unusual .",
    "however the extended cold clumps are located in the outskirts of the active star forming area .",
    "they may be the sites for future star formation .    the statistical analysis of the temperature and spectral index spatial distribution shows an evidence for an inverse correlation between these two parameters .",
    "this effect is not well explained yet , especially in the submillimeter spectral range for cold grains ( @xmath12 20 k ) .",
    "it has been shown to occur in the laboratory for warm grains by mennella ( 1998 ) , and for cold grains in the millimeter by agladze ( 1996 ) .",
    "we estimated the column densities and masses of the observed regions , by simply modelling the thermal emission of the grains from dsert ( 1990 ) or ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) .",
    "there is a good agreement between the @xmath5 column densities and those derived from our submillimeter measurement .",
    "this demonstrates the robustness of dust opacity values in the grain models .",
    "the submillimeter wide band spectro - imaging is thus a natural way to derive masses in the interstellar medium .",
    "finally we see a trend that the closer to the complex the cold clouds are , the more unstable they are .",
    "the history of star formation around omc-1 shows that there have already been 3 to 4 successive bursts of star formation in this region with the embedded cluster responsible for the bn / kl object being the latest .",
    "the clouds that we observe close to the active region may thus be the seeds of the next generation of stars .",
    "this is of course quite speculative and should be sustained by more observations , particularly of the possible embedded protostars .",
    "we wish to thank drs nagahama , mizuno , ogawa and fukui , for kindly having provided us their co maps .",
    "we are indebted to the french space agency centre national dtudes spatiales ( cnes ) , which supported the pronaos project .",
    "we are very grateful to the pronaos technical teams at the cnrs and cnes , and to the nasa - nsbf balloon - launching facilities group of fort sumner ( new mexico ) ."
