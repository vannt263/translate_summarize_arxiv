    "with the many hundreds of planet candidates from radial velocity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more than a thousand putative candidates from transits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the population of close - in ( @xmath01  au ) exoplanets is starting to be reasonably well characterized down to sub - jovian masses .",
    "less is known about the wide ( @xmath310  au ) population of planets , but the range is starting to be probed with direct imaging .",
    "several early surveys came up with null results ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , implying that very massive planets and brown dwarfs are rare in certain parameter ranges @xcite .",
    "however , as instruments and techniques have improved , and as a wider range of target classes have been examined , substellar companions to stars have been increasingly discovered at a range of orbital separations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , some of the first probable giant planetary systems have been detected around a - stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the close - in population of planets is believed to have formed by core accretion ( e.g. *",
    "* ) , the wide separations and high masses of some of these companions have led to the speculation that disk instabilities may play a role in the formation of such objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the possible increase in frequency of massive planets around more massive stars implied by the direct imaging detections and shown more clearly in radial velocity surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be attributed to the fact that more massive stars are expected to have more massive disks , which should benefit any planet formation mechanism . at some stellar mass",
    ", one might however expect the frequency of planets formed by core accretion to turn over , because the uv radiation increases with stellar mass , which decreases the primordial disk lifetime , and which may in turn impact core accretion since it requires formation timescales of a similar order , a few myrs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "disk instabilities , on the other hand , operate on much shorter timescales and should be insensitive to this effect . hence",
    ", one might expect that the most massive stars should be the most beneficial hosts for the formation of massive giant planets and brown dwarfs through disk instability .    in this paper",
    ", we address the occurrence of massive planets and brown dwarfs around massive stars through high - contrast imaging of 18 of the heaviest stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we examine 15 stars in the b2a0 spectral type range over almost the full parameter range in which disk instabilities could be expected to form substellar companions .",
    "we investigate two white dwarfs , likely remnants of very massive progenitors , over almost the full primordial range in which massive giant planets are expected to form or reside from core accretion .",
    "in addition , the very nearby a7-type star altair is examined with a high sensitivity to giant planet companions . in the following",
    ", we first present the observations and data reduction , then the process of data analysis , comparison with theoretical models , and monte carlo simulations .",
    "this is followed by a discussion about core accretion and disc instability , and the implications of this study in that context .",
    "finally , we make some concluding remarks .",
    "the observations presented in this paper were taken with adaptive optics using primarily niri @xcite at gemini north , and additionally ircs @xcite at subaru and nirc2 at keck . a summary of the observational parameters is provided in table [ t : observations ] .",
    "our original plan for the niri data was to observe each star in both the ch4s- and br@xmath4-band .",
    "the ch4s - band then provides optimal sensitivity at large separations where the background noise sets the limit . at small separations",
    ", br@xmath4 observations would provide the best sensitivity , as the contrast performance in that band has been shown to be outstanding for bright stars with present - day instrumentation @xcite .",
    "however , during the first observations with niri+altair it became clear that the thermal background of this instrument combination is far higher than is the case for vlt / naco ( where the previous measurements had been made ) , hence the method could only provide useful information for the very brightest stars in the sample .",
    "instead , we used the @xmath5-band for small separations for the majority of the sample .",
    "the b2a0-type stars in the sample were originally chosen based on the constraint that the brightness should be sufficient in @xmath6-band ( @xmath14 mag ) to provide an adequate sensitivity in the br@xmath4-band , and based on their observability with the given instrument in the given observing period .",
    "hence , the sample is brightness - limited ( and thus largely volume - limited for a certain stellar mass ) .",
    "some stars were removed from the list on the basis of binarity that would severely affect the achievable contrast or dynamical stability in the systems , but no obvious relevant bias results from this selection ."
