    "in the dual parton model ( dpm ) the charged multiplicity per unit rapidity in a symmetric collision is given by @xcite    @xmath1 + \\nn \\\\ & & \\big ( n(b ) - n_a(b)\\big ) \\big ( 2 k \\",
    "n_{\\mu}^{q_s-\\bar{q}_s}(y ) \\big ) \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath2 and @xmath3 stand for the projectile and target nuclei , @xmath4 is the average number of binary collisions and @xmath5 the average number of participants of nucleus @xmath6 .",
    "these quantities can be computed in a glauber model .",
    "@xmath7 is the average number of inelastic collisions in @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the total average number of collisions suffered by each nucleon .",
    "the first term in ( [ 1e ] ) is the plateau height in a @xmath8 collision , resulting from the superposition of @xmath10 strings , multiplied by @xmath11 . since in dpm",
    "there are two strings per inelastic collision , the second term , consisting of strings stretched between sea quarks and antiquarks , makes up a total number of strings equal to @xmath12 .    the charged multiplicity produced by a single string",
    "is obtained by a convolution of momentum distribution function and fragmentation functions ( eqs .",
    "( 3.1 ) to ( 3.4 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "shadowing corrections in gribov theory are universal @xcite , i.e. they apply both to soft and hard processes . the reduction of the multiplicity resulting from shadowing corrections has been computed in @xcite .",
    "these corrections are negligeable at sps energies but at rhic energies they reduce the multiplicity by 40 to 50% .",
    "we present the results @xcite obtained at two different energies  : @xmath13 and 130 gev .",
    "the corresponding non - diffractive cross - sections are @xmath14 and 33 mb , respectively .",
    "we take @xmath15 and 2.0 corresponding to @xmath16 and 2.72 .",
    "the result in absence of shadowing at @xmath13 is shown in fig  1 ( a ) .",
    "we obtain a mild increase of the multiplicity per participant consistent with the results of the wa98 collaboration @xcite . this increase gets stronger with increasing energies .",
    "as we pointed out before , shadowing corrections are negligeable at sps energies but their effect is large at rhic .",
    "unfortunately , shadowing corrections have a rather large uncertainty at rhic energies .",
    "two alternative calculations @xcite of shadowing lead to the results at @xmath17 gev shown by the solid lines in fig  1 ( b ) . clearly , with the larger values of the shadowing corrections we obtain a quantitative agreement with the phenix data @xcite .",
    "note that our calculations refer to @xmath18 while the first rhic measurements refer to @xmath19 .",
    "the latter is , of course , smaller at mid rapidities .",
    "this difference is negligibly small as sps where the laboratory pseudo - rapidity variable is used .",
    "however , at @xmath17 gev where @xmath20 is used instead , their ratio can be as large as 1.3 @xcite .",
    "the predictions at @xmath21 gev were also given in @xcite .",
    "the predicted increase between @xmath22 and @xmath23 gev is @xmath24  % in quantitative agreement with the measurement by the brahms collaboration @xcite .",
    "in the comovers approach the @xmath0 survival probability is the product of two factors @xmath27 .",
    "the first factor represents the suppression due to nuclear absorption of the @xmath28 pair .",
    "its expression , given by the probabilistic glauber model , is well known .",
    "it contains a parameter , the absorptive cross - section @xmath29 .",
    "the second factor @xmath30 represents the suppression resulting from the interaction with comovers .",
    "they are given by    [ 6e ] s^abs(b , s ) = [ 1 - ( - at_a(s )  _ abs ) ] [ 1 - ( - b  t_b ( b - s )  _ abs ) ] _",
    "abs^2  ab  t_a(s )  t_b(b - s )    [ 7e ] s^co ( b , s ) =    in ( [ 7e ] ) , @xmath31 is the density of charged comovers ( positives and negatives ) in the rapidity region of the dimuon trigger and @xmath32  @xmath33 @xcite @xcite is the corresponding density in @xmath8 .",
    "the factor 3/2 in ( [ 7e ] ) takes care of the neutrals . in the numerical calculations we use @xmath34  mb and @xmath35  mb @xcite @xcite",
    "we compute the density of comovers in the framework of the dpm as we have explained before .",
    "this approach allows to compute the impact parameter of the @xmath0 event sample .",
    "experimental results of this quantitie are plotted as a function of observable quantities such as @xmath25 or @xmath26 . using the proportionality between @xmath25 and multiplicity",
    ", we have    [ 7be ] e_t(b ) = 1 2 q n^co_y_cal(b ) .",
    "the multiplicity of comovers @xmath36 is determined using eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) in the rapidity region of the na50 calorimeter ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath38 is introduced because @xmath36 is the charged multiplicity whereas @xmath25 refers to neutrals .",
    "thus the coefficient @xmath39 is close to the average energy per participant and its value can be determined from the position of the `` knee '' of the @xmath25 distribution of the @xmath40 events measured by the na50 collaboration .",
    "we obtain @xmath41 gev @xcite .",
    "the energy of the zero degree calorimeter is defined as    [ 7ce ] e_zdc(b ) = [ a - n_a(b)]e_in + n_a(b ) e_in .",
    "here @xmath42 is the number of spectator nucleons of @xmath6 and @xmath43 gev is the beam energy .",
    "the last term represents the small fraction of wounded nucleons and/or fast secondaries that hit the zd calorimeter .",
    "the value of @xmath44 can be precisely determined from the position of the @xmath40 event sample measured by na50 .",
    "we obtain @xcite @xmath45 . eqs .",
    "( [ 7be ] ) and ( [ 7ce ] ) also lead to a correlation between ( average values of ) @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this correlation is close to a straight line @xcite and gives a good description of the experimental one .    to explain the experimental data beyond the knee of the @xmath25 distribution we introduce two effects :    \\1 .",
    "* comovers fluctuations * @xcite : we introduce the fluctuation in the density of comovers by replacing @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ 7e ] ) by @xmath47 where @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the measured value of the trasverse energy and @xmath49 is its average value given by eq .",
    "( [ 7be ] ) - which does not contain the fluctuations .",
    "\\2 . * @xmath25 loss * @xcite : in the @xmath0 event sample , @xmath50 gev is taken by the @xmath0 trigger and , thus , the transverse energy deposited in the calorimeter by the other hadron species will be slightly smaller than the corresponding one in the @xmath40 event sample .",
    "the results of our model for the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath51 , versus @xmath52 , in @xmath53 collisions at @xmath54 gev , are shown in fig .",
    "2a and compared with na50 data @xcite - both for the true @xmath0 over @xmath51 ratio , and for the one obtained with the @xmath40 analysis .",
    "the results of the model for the true ratio are given by the dotted line ( without fluctuations ) and the dashed line ( with fluctuations ) .",
    "in both cases the @xmath25 loss mechanism is not taken into account . however , our results for the true ratio @xmath0 over @xmath51 do not change , since the effect due to the @xmath52 loss cancels in this ratio .",
    "we see that our results are in good agreement with the na50 which do not extend beyond the knee .",
    "the other data in fig .",
    "2a are obtained with the @xmath40 analysis , and have to be compared with the dashed - dotted and solid curves ( obtained taking into account the @xmath25 loss ) . in this case the agreement with the na50 data is substantially improved .    in fig .",
    "2b the results for the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath51 versus @xmath26 are shown .",
    "these curves are obtained from the corresponding ones versus @xmath25 applying the @xmath55 correlation @xcite .",
    "comparing the data with the model predictions , we see that a better description of the central data ( small @xmath26 ) is obtained when the @xmath52 fluctuations are taken into account .",
    "this was to be expected since the fluctuations in @xmath52 and @xmath26 are related to each other via the @xmath56 correlation .",
    "it is important to note that the effect of the @xmath25 loss is not present in this case .",
    "indeed @xmath26 measures the energy of spectators and it is not affected by the dimuon trigger .",
    "no disagreement between the data and the model predictions is observed in this case for very central events .",
    "in order to compute the @xmath0 suppression at rhic in the comovers approach we need to know not only the effects of nuclear absorption and comovers interaction , but also the effect of shadowing  which becomes important at rhic energies . therefore , our predictions are only valid so far as the shadowing corrections cancel in the @xmath0 over @xmath51 ratio  which is not necessarily the case @xcite .    for the comovers survival probability , eq .",
    "( [ 7e ] ) , we keep the value @xmath35  mb as discussed above .",
    "the hadronic multiplicity at rhic energies have been successfully evaluated in dpm @xcite .",
    "therefore , the prediction at rhic for this survival probability is rather safe .",
    "the situation is quite different in what concerns the survival probability due to nuclear absorption .",
    "it is widely recognized @xcite that , at high energy , when the coherence length becomes larger than the nuclear size , the probabilistic expression ( [ 6e ] ) is no longeer valid .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that , at asymptotic energies , eq .",
    "( [ 6e ] ) is replaced by      where @xmath57 is the total @xmath28-@xmath58 cross - section . if @xmath59 , the asymptotic result is not very different from the one obtained with the low energy formula  since eqs .",
    "( [ 6e ] ) and ( [ 8e ] ) differ only in the second correction term .",
    "this situation is expected if the @xmath28 pair is produced in a colorless state interacting as a dipole .",
    "however , the possibility has been advocated @xcite , that the @xmath28 pair is produced in a color state accompanied by light quarks  in order to make the system colorless . in this case",
    "the system interacts with a comparatively large cross - section @xmath60  mb @xcite .",
    "with such a cross - section it is possible to explain the large suppression of the @xmath0 observed at @xmath61 , without initial state energy loss of the projectile partons in the nucleus .",
    "the results for the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath51 at mid - rapidities are presented in fig .",
    "the dashed line is obtained with eq .",
    "( [ 6e ] ) and @xmath34  mb .",
    "the solid line is obtained with eq .",
    "( [ 8e ] ) and @xmath62  mb . as we see , the difference between the two predictions is very large .    the proposed way of measuring the @xmath0 suppression at rhic is via the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath63 . for the latter ,",
    "the situation is even more complicated . due to",
    "its larger mass , the correlation length is smaller and eq .",
    "( [ 8e ] ) is not valid even at mid - rapidities . in this case",
    "a finite energy formula @xcite has to be used  which interpolates between the low energy , eq .",
    "( [ 6e ] ) , and the asymptotic ( eq .",
    "( [ 8e ] ) ) limits .",
    "actually , even for @xmath0 , eq . ( [ 8e ] ) is not exact at mid - rapidities .",
    "we have estimated that using the finite energy formula with @xmath62 mb the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath51 for central events is 40  % higher than the solid line in fig .",
    "therefore an accurate measurement in @xmath64 interactions will be necessary in order to clarify the theoretical situation .",
