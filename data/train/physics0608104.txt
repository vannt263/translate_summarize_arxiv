    "when circularly polarized light is incident normally on a periodically nonhomogeneous , structurally chiral medium of sufficient thickness  such as a chiral sculptured thin film ( stf)the circular bragg phenomenon may occur  @xcite . the part of the light spectrum that falls within a range known as the bragg regime is largely reflected from the chiral stf provided that the circular polarization state matches the structural handedness of the medium .",
    "if the circular polarization state is opposite , little light is reflected .",
    "research has elucidated the time ",
    "domain mechanism of the circular bragg phenomenon as pulse bleeding , a continuous transfer of energy from the refracted pulse within the chiral stf to the reflected pulse outside of it  @xcite .",
    "pulse bleeding has also been predicted for incident videopulses , which are about one or two optical cycles in duration  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this communication is to extend previous work on the quantification of the durations and average speeds of ultrashort optical pulses through chiral stfs to videopulses  @xcite .",
    "we computed three measures each of the durations and average speeds of videopulses transmitted through linear and nonlinear chiral stfs .",
    "the videopulses had different carrier wavelengths and polarization states , and we identified trends in duration and average speed as those parameters were varied .",
    "section  [ s : theory ] gives the constitutive relations of the chiral stfs studied , and explains the measures of duration and average speed we used .",
    "section  [ s : results ] contains explanations of the trends we identified .",
    "let us now describe the constitutive relations of the chiral stfs we studied and provide definitions of the measures of videopulse duration and average speed we used .",
    "the polarization @xmath0 of a spatially local , dielectric , structurally right  handed chiral stf occupying the slab region @xmath1 depends on the electric field @xmath2 as follows : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the permittivity of free space , @xmath5 is the time , and @xmath6 is the position vector defined with respect to a cartesian coordinate system defined with unit vectors @xmath7 .",
    "the nonlinearity parameter @xmath8 determines whether the chiral stf will obey the superposition principle ; when @xmath9 the film is linear , but it exhibits an intensity  dependent permittivity otherwise  @xcite .",
    "the dielectric susceptibility dyadic @xmath10 , which is null  valued for @xmath11 , can be factored for @xmath12 as follows : @xmath13 here , the helicoidal rotation dyadic @xmath14 contains the structural half  period @xmath15 , the chiral stf taken to be structurally right  handed ; and the tilt dyadic @xmath16 is parameterized by the angle of rise @xmath17 .",
    "the reference susceptibility dyadic @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 in the foregoing equation the oscillator strengths @xmath21 and the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 quantify the resonance wavelengths and absorption characteristics of the chiral stf ; @xmath24 are the resonance angular frequencies ; and @xmath25 is the unit step function .",
    "a pulsed plane wave , consisting of a circularly polarized carrier plane wave @xmath26 that is amplitude  modulated by a pulse envelope @xmath27 , was launched from the plane @xmath28 towards the chiral stf .",
    "the carrier plane wave was characterized by the carrier wavelength @xmath29 and whether it was left circularly polarized ( lcp ) or right circularly polarized ( rcp ) .",
    "the pulse envelope was gaussian as per @xmath30 with @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "the pulse envelope was characterized by the time constant @xmath33 and the time delay @xmath34 .",
    "the total energy per unit area @xmath35 was chosen so that @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the axial component of the instantaneous poynting vector .",
    "the propagation of the pulse was computed with a finite  difference method  @xcite .",
    "we considered three measures of pulse duration ",
    "the equivalent , root mean square ( rms ) , and correlation  and three measures of average speed ",
    "the peak , center  of  energy , and correlation .    to define these measures",
    ", we used the following notation .",
    "the @xmath38 moment @xmath39 of a scalar function @xmath40 with respect to variable @xmath41 on the interval @xmath42 is @xmath43 and the rms deviation from the centroid @xmath44 is  @xcite @xmath45 when @xmath46 , both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are undefined .",
    "the electromagnetic energy density is @xmath49 we recorded @xmath50 of the transmitted pulse over the interval @xmath51 at @xmath52 .",
    "the equivalent duration  @xcite is defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 indicates , within the chosen interval , the maximum value of a function .",
    "the rms duration is defined as @xmath55 the correlation duration @xmath56 is defined as  @xcite @xmath57    we found the times @xmath58 where the function @xmath59 indicates the time at which the maximum value occurs . then , the average peak speed @xmath60 , center  of  energy speed @xmath61 , and correlation speed @xmath62  @xcite were calculated as follows : @xmath63 in our calculations , we used the rectangular rule to approximate integrals  @xcite .",
    "the results of our calculations for incident videopulses are presented in figures  [ f : durations ] and  [ f : average speeds ] .",
    "the parameters describing the chiral stf were chosen as follows : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68  nm , @xmath69  nm , @xmath70  nm , and @xmath71 ; the film was either linear ( case  l , @xmath72 ) or nonlinear ( case  n , @xmath73  m@xmath74/v@xmath74 ) .",
    "the chiral stf was ten pitches thick ( @xmath75  @xmath76 m and @xmath77  @xmath76 m ) .",
    "these parameters fix the center wavelength of the bragg regime of the linear chiral stf to @xmath78  nm and the full  width half  maximum bandwidth to @xmath79  nm  @xcite ; but both quantitites will shift slightly when @xmath80  m@xmath74/v@xmath74  @xcite .",
    "the incident videopulses had the following parameters : @xmath81  j / m@xmath74 , @xmath82  fs , and @xmath83  fs .",
    "they therefore comprised about @xmath84 optical cycle depending on the carrier wavelength , which was varied from 395635  nm in increments of 20  nm .",
    "several general trends are evident in figures  [ f : durations ] and  [ f : average speeds ] . the durations tended to decrease with increasing carrier wavelength , and tended to increase , for given carrier wavelength and polarization state , in going from the linear case to the nonlinear one .",
    "these two trends were also noted in an earlier study for longer ",
    "duration ( @xmath85  fs ) incident pulses  @xcite .",
    "there are several differences between these results and the results of the previous study . in figure",
    "[ f : durations ] , there is a large spread between the three measures of duration .",
    "moreover , the decrease in durations with wavelength is less drastic in the case of videopulses than with the longer  duration pulses we studied earlier .",
    "this comparison can be explained by recourse to frequency ",
    "domain arguments as follows .",
    "the canonical refractive indexes of a chiral stf decrease with increasing free ",
    "space wavelength above the resonance wavelengths , along with the dispersion exhibited by the film  @xcite .",
    "this decrease accounts for the decrease in durations with increasing wavelength , as there is less dispersion at higher wavelengths to elongate the pulse . as the duration of the incident pulse",
    "is decreased to that of a videopulse , its bandwidth widens accordingly .",
    "this wider bandwidth causes the pulse to disperse more , for a given carrier wavelength , than a pulse with narrower bandwidth .",
    "therefore , the durations of transmitted pulses decrease at a slower rate with increasing wavelength when the incident pulses are of shorter duration .",
    "moreover , in our earlier work , we found that that there is a local maximum in the rms measure of duration when the chiral stf is linear and the circular bragg phenomenon occurs  @xcite .",
    "there is no such local maximum evident in figure  [ f : durations ] .",
    "we attribute this effect to the wide bandwidth of the videopulses as compared to the longer ",
    "duration pulses studied earlier .",
    "the wide bandwidth effectively swamps the circular bragg phenomenon .",
    "the center  of  energy speeds increase modestly with increasing wavelength ; and they decrease , for given carrier wavelength and polarization state , for the nonlinear case as compared to the linear one .",
    "however , the peak and correlation speeds remain roughly constant with increasing carrier wavelength , close in value , and larger than the center  of  energy speeds . and",
    "the peak and correlation speeds decrease , for given carrier wavelength and polarization state , from the linear to the nonlinear case , but only slightly .",
    "the rate of increase in center  of  energy speed with increasing carrier wavelength is less for videopulses than for the longer ",
    "duration pulses we studied earlier  @xcite .",
    "we expect identification of these trends to be useful to designers of chiral stf  based devices .",
    "such devices shall be limited to shaping pulses of bandwidth narrower than a certain value , due to the swamping of the circular bragg phenomenon by shorter  duration pulses .",
