    "the @xmath7 redshift is a critical epoch at which both the global star formation rate ( sfr ) and the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity appear to have peaked ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the morphological differentiation of galaxies was fully underway ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for a period of a few billion years , a large fraction ( at least 50% ) of massive galaxies with @xmath8 formed stars at sufficiently high sfrs ( @xmath9 ) to produce the bulk of their stellar populations in this span of time : i.e.",
    ", this is the  formation epoch  of these galaxies .",
    "therefore , learning as much as possible about the ( physical ) properties of these @xmath4 galaxies will help us to determine how galaxies accumulate their mass and stellar populations .",
    "the specific sfr ( ssfr ) of most star - forming galaxies has been found to be a tight but weak function of stellar mass at all epochs up to at least @xmath10 , forming the so - called _ main sequence ( ms ) _ of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the characteristic ssfr of the main sequence increases strongly with redshift , by a factor of 20 back to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this implies that galaxies with sfrs that are an order of magnitude or more higher than those of local galaxies of the same stellar mass ( see eq . 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are nevertheless the `` normal '' ms population of star - forming galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "the tightness of the ssfr on the ms suggests that the sfr is evolving in a quasi - equilibrium state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    the _ chemical evolution _ of such galaxies , as traced by their gaseous o / h ratio , is a key diagnostic . in the local universe , there is a tight mass - metallicity relation ( mzr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with , in sdss , a 1@xmath12 dispersion of o / h ranging from 0.20 dex at low mass , log(m/)@xmath13 , to 0.07 dex at high mass , log(m/)@xmath14 @xcite . considering their median errors in determining masses and metallicities of 0.09 and 0.03 dex , respectively , @xcite estimated that roughly half of the spread in the mass - metallicity relation could be attributed to observational uncertainties .",
    "the sdss mzr has a relatively steep slope below @xmath15 , for a @xcite imf , but flattens at higher masses .",
    "using chemical evolution models , @xcite interpreted the flattening in terms of efficient galactic winds that remove metals from galaxies with shallow potential wells ( lower - mass galaxies ) , an idea first introduced by @xcite .",
    "other explanations are also possible .",
    "flattening of the slope of the mzr at lower redshift has been interpreted as the chemical version of galaxy downsizing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , @xcite claimed that the flattening of the mzr at later times could be due to a redshift evolution in the stellar mass at which the metallicities of galaxies begin to saturate .",
    "it is also well - established that the mzr at @xmath16 evolves relative to that seen locally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the observed shape and evolution of the mzr at high redshifts is likely to be affected by the selection of the samples and metallicity estimators used .     in the local universe ,",
    "the o / h at a given mass also depends on the sfr ( and thus also ssfr ) of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. , the sfr appears to be a `` second - parameter '' in the mzr .",
    "the evidence for an inverse correlation between sfr and o / h is good at low masses , and the scatter in o / h can be reduced to about 0.07 dex across the ( m , sfr ) plane ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ma10 in the following ) .",
    "however , the form of the z(m , sfr ) relation at higher masses is less well - established , and in fact @xcite have claimed that the sfr - dependence reverses .",
    "ma10 represented the local sdss z(m , sfr ) by a second - order polynomial in m and sfr ( their eq.2 describing a surface in the 3d space ) , and , by introducing the new quantity @xmath17 , they also defined a projection of the z(m , sfr ) that minimizes the metallicity scatter of local galaxies .",
    "furthermore , ma10 claimed that the @xmath3 relation seen in measurements of low redshift sdss galaxies ( with @xmath18 ) is also applicable to much higher redshift galaxies , in which the typical sfrs are higher because of the evolution in the ms ssfr .",
    "they coined the phrase fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ) to denote this epoch - invariant @xmath3 relation , and claimed that , `` in practice , metallicity of star - forming galaxies of any mass , any sfr and at any redshift up to z=2.5 follow the following relation : @xmath19 with @xmath20 . ''",
    "this eq.5 of ma10 describes a plane in 3d space , and is a simplification of their eq.4 .    in this paper",
    "we clearly distinguish between ( a ) the existence of a @xmath3 relation at a given epoch ( i.e. , whether the sfr is a second parameter in the mzr ) and ( b ) whether the @xmath3 relation is also epoch - independent .",
    "we reserve the term fmr for an epoch-_independent _ @xmath3 relation . as we discuss further below",
    ", it is clear that assessing the epoch-(in)dependence of the @xmath3 relation depends on the choice of extrapolation of any locally - defined @xmath3 relation into regions of the ( m , sfr ) parameter space that are poorly , if at all , populated in the local universe .",
    "ma10 suspected that their fmr held up to @xmath21 , but evolved at @xmath22 , using the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eb06 in the following ) sample at @xmath4 , and the galaxy samples at @xmath22 of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "initial explanations of why sfr is a second parameter in the mzr have generally involved ad hoc inflow of gas diluting the metallicity and increasing star - formation @xcite . in a recent paper , however , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* li13 in the following ) showed that a @xmath3 relation is a natural outcome of a simple model of galaxies in which the sfr is regulated by the mass of gas present in a galaxy , and calculated the relation expected when a galaxy evolves in a quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "they argued that this gas regulation would work at least since @xmath10 and possibly also at higher redshifts .",
    "their derived z(m , sfr ) relation has a particular analytic form and depends on the internal parameters describing the regulator system , specifically the star - formation efficiency @xmath23 ( which is therefore the inverse of the gas depletion timescale @xmath24 ) , and the mass - loading of any wind that drives gas out of the system , their @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath3 relation would only evolve to the extent that these two parameters change with epoch ( at fixed galactic mass ) , providing an attractive explanation for the claimed existence of an fmr .",
    "li13 could represent the local sdss data from ma10 with their predicted @xmath3 relation with astrophysically plausible values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 and reasonable mass - dependences of these two parameters .",
    "it should be noted that the analytic approximations employed by li13 have since been verified by more detailed calculations in @xcite .",
    "the form and possible epoch-(in)dependence of the @xmath3 relation thus emerges , along with other measures of the state of high redshift galaxies , as a very powerful diagnostic of the regulation of star - formation in typical ms galaxies .",
    "the definition of this relation at high redshifts is therefore a priority .",
    "there are a number of ways to estimate the chemical abundances in galaxies , especially through the analysis of emission line ratios of gas in star - forming hii regions . over the years",
    ", a number of diagnostics have been developed based on strong lines , including the well - known @xmath28 parameter first introduced by @xcite .",
    "this is based on the ratio of oxygen lines @xmath29\\,}{\\lambda\\,3727}$ ] and @xmath30\\,}{\\lambda\\,5007}$ ] to h@xmath31 .",
    "this ratio must be corrected for reddening using the h@xmath32 to h@xmath31 ratio .",
    "a degeneracy between high and low o / h values that exists for most values of @xmath33 can be broken using , e.g. , the [ nii]6584/h@xmath32 ratio , or other means as summarized in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "finally , the o / h calibration also varies with ionization parameter , @xmath34 , which may well vary with redshift but which can be estimated from @xmath35}/{\\rm [ o\\,ii]\\,}$ ] . in our earlier work @xcite , we extended the basic @xmath33 method by simultaneously fitting all of these five lines ( , , , , and ) for metallicity o / h , reddening @xmath36 and ionization parameter @xmath34 .",
    "unfortunately , at high redshifts around @xmath10 , these five lines are seen in the atmospheric windows for a limited range of redshifts only , namely at @xmath37 . at higher redshifts , the h@xmath32 and [ nii ] lines which are critical for the practical implementation of the @xmath33 method",
    "are shifted redward of the k - band window . even within this narrow redshift window ,",
    "the chance of having all five lines clear of strong telluric oh emission is not very high .",
    "in addition , near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy at these faint levels is difficult , even on 8-m class telescopes .    as a result",
    ", none of pioneering studies of metallicities of star - forming galaxies at @xmath4 @xcite has been based on measurements of all five lines , and only a handful , i.e. , four galaxies of eb06 , five of @xcite , two galaxies from lsd @xcite , and a few amaze objects @xcite have measurements of even three or four of the lines .",
    "the derived o / h metallicities have therefore been based on a series of ad hoc calibrations of more limited line ratios , and often just [ nii]/h@xmath32 , as in the large sample of eb06 .",
    "these suffer from significant scatter and systematic uncertainties arising from the poor knowledge of ionization parameter ( in case of the n2 calibration ) and/or reddening . even now",
    ", there are only six @xmath4 galaxies with the five emission line fluxes measured in the literature , four of which are gravitationally lensed and all having rather low mass @xcite .    there are therefore several caveats regarding the extensive eb06 study of metallicities of 87 galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "the ionization parameter could not be measured for any of these galaxies , and only coarse oxygen abundances using the [ nii]/h@xmath32 ratio were determined by applying the so - called n2 calibration @xcite , which does not take the ionization parameter into account . in fig.[n2_ionpar ] we show the [ nii]/h@xmath32 ratio vs. metallicity as a function of the ionization parameter @xmath34 ( dotted lines ) , based on fig .",
    "7 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kd02 in the following ) .",
    "the reason why the n2 calibration works at low redshift is that ionization is correlated with metallicity .",
    "however , if this is also true at higher redshift is a matter of debate , and it is not clear which range of ionization parameters one should adopt at each metallicity at higher redshift .    to derive the mzr at @xmath4 , eb06 used the averaged [ nii]/h@xmath32 ratios in six stellar mass bins each containing @xmath38 galaxies , and estimated the o / h metallicities of these six averaged spectra using the n2 calibration .",
    "the horizontal lines in fig.[n2_ionpar ] show the measurements of [ nii]/h@xmath32 and the inferred range in o / h ( the ionization parameter , i.e. , the location on a corresponding dotted line , is not known ) , while the filled blue circles show the o / h measurements derived by eb06 .",
    "the magenta oblique line has been transformed from the n2 calibration to the kd02 calibration ( used in this paper ) by applying the conversion given in tab.3 of @xcite .",
    "it is obvious from fig.[n2_ionpar ] that , without knowledge of the ionization parameter ( dotted lines ) , the metallicity estimates have very large uncertainties , especially at high metallicities : the six horizontal blue lines of possible o / h at a given [ nii]/h@xmath32 extend over @xmath39dex .",
    "it should be noted that it was stated by @xcite that `` with the n2 calibrator it is possible to estimate the abundance of oxygen to within a factor of 2.5 at the 95 per cent confidence level . ''",
    "factor 2.5 corresponds to about 0.4dex , which is comparable to the scatter in o / h at a given log([nii]/h@xmath32 ) in fig.[n2_ionpar ] ( indicated by the blue lines ) .",
    "furthermore , only 4 of the 87 galaxies in the eb06 sample have [ oiii]@xmath40 and h@xmath31 line fluxes measured in addition to h@xmath32 and [ nii ] , i.e. , no information on type-2 agn contamination is available for all but 5% of the galaxies in the eb06 sample .",
    "it is therefore unclear whether the ionization in these objects is dominated by an agn , which would lead to highly uncertain metallicity measurements .",
    "unfortunately , these uncertainties in both the ionization parameter and agn contribution are now strong impediments to a clear understanding of these galaxies and of the chemical evolution at @xmath4 .    to overcome these uncertainties , we have carried out nir follow - up spectroscopy with subaru - moircs and vlt - sinfoni of 20 star - forming galaxies at @xmath5 , selected from the zcosmos - deep sample . as well as providing a large enough parent sample , using zcosmos - deep galaxies enables us to also use the wealth of information on these galaxies that is available from the cosmos survey .",

    "in addition , we use dex throughout to denote the anti - logarithm , i.e. , 0.3 dex is a factor of 2 .",
    "the target galaxies for the nir spectroscopy with moircs and sinfoni were selected from the zcosmos - deep galaxy catalog .",
    "zcosmos - deep is measuring several thousand redshifts in a broad redshift range @xmath45 .",
    "we first selected a parent sample which we call _ elpar _ of @xmath46 zcosmos - deep galaxies with redshifts @xmath5 of high confidence classes",
    "2.5 , 3 or 4 , i.e. , reliable redshifts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "class 3 and 4 are very secure redshifts , while class 2.5 are less secure spectroscopic redshifts , but the decimal place .5 indicates that the spectroscopic and photometric redshift of objects with confidence class 2.5 are consistent to within @xmath47 .",
    "x - ray detected objects were excluded from the sample elpar using the xmm @xcite , and chandra cosmos observations @xcite .    for the nir spectroscopic follow - up",
    "we only selected those elpar galaxies with redshift confidence classes 3 or 4 , i.e. , the most reliable redshifts based on unambiguous multiple spectral features that leave no room for any doubt about the redshift .",
    "for each galaxy , we estimated an sfr using the model spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits obtained , at the spectroscopic redshift , by the zebra ( zurich extragalactic bayesian redshift analyzer , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) code applied to the multi - band cosmos photometry in the bands u , b , v , g , r , i , z and ks . we used this sfr to predict an h@xmath32 flux by applying the @xcite conversion of h@xmath32 luminosity into sfr ( cf .",
    "sect.[sfrs ] ) .",
    "we then selected only those objects with sed - based sfrs larger than @xmath48/yr for the sinfoni observations , corresponding to an expected observed h@xmath32 flux larger than @xmath49ergs / s/@xmath50 at these redshifts , but also included targets with lower sed - based sfrs as fill - in objects during the subaru moircs mask preparations .",
    "multi - object spectroscopic observations were performed with moircs @xcite in the second half of the nights of 2010 january 25 - 28 .",
    "we used moircs in mos mode with the k1300 grism for the k - band , vph - h grism for the h - band , and vph - j grism for the j - band observations . the spectral resolution with a 0.8 slit",
    "is @xmath51 in k , and @xmath52 in h and j. eight main target galaxies at @xmath4 were observed with one slit mask , with a total exposure time of @xmath53 hours in each of the bands j , h , and k. the seeing varied between 0.4 and 0.7 .",
    "the target acquisition was done using 6 alignment stars , and the telescope was dithered along the slit by 2.0 .",
    "the single exposure times were 1200s . at the end of each observing night ,",
    "an a0v type star was observed for flux calibration with the same instrument configuration as the targets , and at different positions on the mask for the vph grisms , to take into account that the sensitivity curve shifts for the vph grisms , when the slits at different x positions ( in raw image ) are used .",
    "it should be noted that this sensitivity curve dependence of the vph grisms on the position of the slits was seriously hampering the observations , in terms of restricting a lot the target selection and diminishing the s / n obtained .",
    "the data reduction was done using the moircs mos data pipelines ( mcsmdp ) reduction script ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "* their sect.3.1 ) .",
    "this included flatfielding by a dome flat , rejection of bad pixels and cosmic - rays , sky - subtraction between each exposure pair , and distortion correction of the mos frames .",
    "each 2-d spectrogram was then cut out based on the mask design file , wavelength calibration was done based on the oh sky emission lines , residuals of the sky subtraction ( due to time variation of oh emission during dithering observations ) were subtracted by fitting with a quadratic equation along the column , and finally all frames were co - added with appropriate offsets and weights .",
    "the response spectra , including atmospheric transmission and instrument efficiency , were derived using the a0v - type stars hip 68713 and hip 74050 .",
    "the data of these standard stars were reduced to a two - dimensional spectrum in the same way as for the galaxy targets , and the continuum was then traced with a polynomial to extract a one - dimensional spectrum with iraf : apall .",
    "finally the one - dimensional spectrum of the standard star was divided by the best - fit model spectrum to obtain the response spectrum .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was then performed by normalizing to the j- , h- or k - band total magnitude , respectively .",
    "observations with the sinfoni integral field spectrograph @xcite in up to three bands ( j , h , and k ) were performed between the beginning of january and the end of april 2010 .",
    "we used `` on - source '' dithering for all targets , which are sufficiently small to fit in the region of overlap of all science exposures for a target .",
    "briefly , two successive exposures are dithered by roughly 1/2 of the field - of - view ( by about 4 arcsec ) , so that the frames can be subtracted pairwise for background subtraction .",
    "exposure times were 40min for k - band , and 60min for j and h - band observations .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath54 in k , @xmath55 in h , and @xmath56 in j - band .",
    "the seeing varied between 0.7 and 1.2 .",
    "the accuracy of the zcosmos - deep redshifts is about @xmath57 at @xmath41 , and they are generally absorption line redshifts from rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) features ( from the vimos optical spectroscopy ) , which often show a significant velocity offset with respect to the emission line gas ( see columns @xmath58 and @xmath59 in tab.[sinf_moircs ] ) . since all five emission lines are clear of oh lines for only a limited range of redshifts , our first step was to observe the h@xmath32 ( and [ nii ] ) lines in k - band for the 12 galaxies given in tab.[sinf_moircs ] .",
    "these measurements allowed us to focus the h@xmath31 , [ oiii ] and [ oii ] observations ( in h- and j - band ) on those galaxies lying at optimal redshifts in terms of the oh emission contamination and emission line flux detections of ( most of the ) five lines .",
    "tab.[sinf_moircs ] indicates the lines that could be observed for each object .",
    "we reduced the sinfoni data with the spread software , especially developed for spiffi @xcite .",
    "the data reduction is analogous to standard procedures applied to nir long - slit spectroscopy but with additional processing to reconstruct the three - dimensional ( 3d ) data cube .",
    "the main reduction steps applied to each science target for a given instrument band are as described in sect.4.2 of @xcite . a special step in the reduction",
    "is that the wavelength calibration and sky subtraction steps were repeated with optimization following the method described by @xcite .",
    "the data of the standard stars were reduced in a similar way as the science data .",
    "flux calibration was performed using the broadband magnitudes of the standards .",
    "correction for atmospheric transmission was done by dividing the science cube by the integrated spectrum of the standard .",
    "emission line fluxes were measured from the calibrated spectra following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the package splot in iraf was used , and the flux errors were usually dominated by systematic uncertainties in establishing the local continuum . for each individual galaxy , tab.[sinf_moircs ] reports either the emission line fluxes or their upper limits .",
    "all five emission line fluxes could be measured for only a few galaxies because of , e.g. , poor seeing during observations in one of the nir bands , low galaxy surface brightness , the overestimation of some sfrs derived from the sed , and atmospheric oh lines coinciding with the positions of some emission lines , as indicated in the respective columns of tab.[sinf_moircs ] .",

    "four galaxies do not have an j - band spectrum , implying no measurement of [ oii ] , and for one galaxy the region of the spectrum where [ oii ] should be detected is affected by a bad pixel area of the moircs instrument . for three galaxies the [ oii ]",

    "additionally , we find a good agreement between the sfrs derived from from the sinfoni and moircs spectra and the sfrs derived from uv ( as described in sect.[sfrs ] ) , which reinforces the reliability of the absolute calibration of the nir data .",
