    "the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization approach , developed in the last few years , is the most successful method for the analysis of heavy quarkonium production and decay processes @xcite . in the framework of this formalism cross section and decay rate of the process involving heavy quarkonium is factorized into the short distance part ( coefficient functions ) and the long distance one . for the cross section @xmath3 , where @xmath4 stands for quarkonium ,",

    "this part of cross section can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "the matrix element @xmath8|0\\rangle$ ] stands for the evolution of the state @xmath7 $ ] into the particular hadronic state @xmath4 .",
    "it is defined by long distance dynamics and can not be computed perturbatively .",
    "the long distance matrix elements scale as a power of @xmath9 - the relative velocity of the heavy constituents in the quarkonium .",
    "so , in the nrqcd factorization approach ( fa ) the cross section of heavy quarkonium production is considered as a double series in the qcd coupling constant and the relative velocity @xmath9 .",
    "the relative importance of long distance matrix elements in powers of @xmath9 can be estimated using the nrqcd velocity scaling rules @xcite .    in the nrqcd factorization approach",
    "the quark - antiquark color octet intermediate states are allowed to contribute in heavy quarkonium production and decay processes in higher order . by such a way the color octet mechanism ( com )",
    "takes into account the complete structure of the quarkonium fock space while in the color singlet model ( csm ) only the dominant fock state is considered @xcite .",
    "the shape of the @xmath10 distribution of the @xmath11 octet state production cross section indicates that @xmath0 and @xmath12 production at large @xmath10 observed at the tevatron ( fnal ) can be explained in the framework of fa @xcite .    despite the obvious successes of the com some problems remain unsolved .",
    "in particular , the theoretical predictions disagree with the @xmath0 and @xmath12 polarization data at fixed target energies @xcite and the com estimation for the yield ratio of @xmath13 and @xmath14 states remains too low @xcite .",
    "these discrepances indicate that higher twist corrections might contribute significantly in production of charmonium states at low @xmath10 and should be considered equally with the com contributions @xcite .",
    "the latter underestimate the @xmath0 photoproduction cross section at large values of @xmath15 in h1 and zeus experiments at hera ( @xmath16 in the proton rest frame)- the most problematic issue of the com @xcite .",
    "the nrqcd factorization approach has predictive power when the relative velocity @xmath9 is small enough , allowing to describe with reasonable accuracy several experimental data by taking into account only a few lower order terms in powers of @xmath9 .",
    "hence it becomes necessary to check the universality of the fa , stating that the values of long distance matrix elements , extracted from the experimental data for different processes , should be the same .",
    "unfortunately , due to the rather large theoretical uncertainties at the present time , the existing experimental data does not allow to extract the values of the long distance matrix elements with enough accuracy .",
    "this has motivated us to look for processes with less theoretical uncertainties to test the color octet mechanism .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath0 polarization in unpolarized hadron - hadron collisions and electroproduction @xcite can be used for these purposes as well as the asymmetries in @xmath0 production @xcite . unlike",
    "hadron - hadron collisions , existing @xmath0 photoproduction data can be explained within the csm taking into account higher order qcd corrections @xcite .",
    "moreover , color octet contributions overestimate the experimental data drastically @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the study of @xmath0 production processes in non - hadron collisions can clarify the existing contradictory picture .",
    "the collision of high - energy , high - intensity photon beams at a photon linear collider , obtained via compton backscattering of laser beams off linac electron beams , should provide another possibility to investigate the heavy quark - antiquark bound states production processes . based on a @xmath17 linear collider",
    ", the plc will have almost the same energy and a luminosity , i.e. a c.m .",
    "energy of 500 - 1000 gev and a luminosity of the order of @xmath18 @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study @xmath0 production at a photon linear collider .",
    "the color octet contribution in @xmath0 production at plc was calculated recently @xcite , where only the direct ( unresolved ) photon - photon collisions were considered .",
    "we will show that the resolved photon processes are more significant because there exist diagrams in lowest order of perturbative qcd leading to the subprocess cross section , non decreasing when the invariant mass of photon - photon system increases . in the next section we present all possible subprocesses in lowest order in perturbative qcd and fix the color octet long distance matrix elements needed .",
    "the numerical results are given in sec .",
    "it is shown the that color octet contribution in resolved photon subprocesses is essential and the expected cross section of charmonium production is large enough even at high @xmath10 ( @xmath19 gev ) allowing to extract valuable information about color octet long distance matrix elements .",
    "for the calculation of the @xmath0 production cross section at plc we consider the following subprocesses : direct @xmath20 collision , single and double resolved photon processes , when the heavy quark - antiquark pair is produced via hadronic components of the photon , which are described in terms of the photon structure functions @xcite .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath21 and @xmath22 the following subprocesses contribute : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes a gluon or quark component of the photon , @xmath25 stands for any possible quark - antiquark state .",
    "the cross section of @xmath0 production in the nrqcd factorization scheme can be presented as    @xmath26    here @xmath27 denotes the branching ratio of the corresponding @xmath25 state into @xmath0 . to the production of each state of quarkonium",
    "both color octet and color singlet states contribute , as in the case of direct @xmath0 production @xmath28 ) \\langle0|{\\cal o}_8^{j/\\psi}(^{2s+1}l_j)|0\\rangle}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over the states @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the framework of the nrqcd fa velocity expansion we consider only the contribution of the dominant sets of color octet states in the direct production of @xmath32 and @xmath33 states of charmonium .    in direct @xmath20 interaction in lowest order",
    "only the two states of heavy quark - antiquark pairs can be produced : @xmath34 color singlet ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath34 color octet @xcite . for the differential cross section of the singlet state production",
    "we have : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the standard mandelstam variables",
    ".    the differential cross section for the @xmath0 production through color octet @xmath34 state can be obtained from ( [ singlet ] ) by the replacement @xmath39    we calculated all possible subprocesses for single resolved photon reaction .",
    "our results are in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the subprocess for @xmath25 states production in double resolved photon case are same as for @xmath0 production in hadron - hadron collision and were calculated by cho and leibovich @xcite .",
    "all color singlet long distance matrix elements are related to the radial quarkonium wave functions at the origin and their derivatives.we have used the buchmller - tye wave functions at the origin , tabulated in @xcite .",
    "the number of color octet long distance matrix elements can be reduced by using the nrqcd spin symmetry relations : @xmath40 these relations are valid up to order @xmath41 .    after using these relations only three independent matrix elements remain - @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which give the main contribution to the direct @xmath0 production cross section .",
    "the values of these parameters are extracted from the data of direct @xmath0 production at cdf @xcite .",
    "we used the results of paper @xcite , where a more detailed numerical analysis was carried out : @xmath45 further we will assume that @xmath46 . for the indirect @xmath0 production via",
    "the @xmath47 states decays we use the following value fitted from the cdf data @xcite : @xmath48    we would like to to mention that all these values contain large uncertainties ( for more detailed analyses see @xcite ) and we use them only to estimate the expected cross sections of the production of different charmonium states at plc .",
    "at plc the energy distributions of the colliding photon beams are not monochromatic .",
    "one of the main characteristics of the compton scattering process is the dimensionless variable @xmath49 , @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the linac beam energy , @xmath52 is the energy of the laser photons and @xmath53 is the angle between the directions of the electron and laser beams .",
    "the maximum energy of the obtained photon beam depends on @xmath49 ,    @xmath54 and increases with increasing @xmath49 .",
    "the value @xmath55 is optimum for plc to prevent @xmath17 pair creation in a collision of laser and backscattered photon beams @xcite . in our calculations we use @xmath56 .",
    "this means that the maximum energy fractio carried by backscattered photon , @xmath57 , is about 0.83 .",
    "the luminosity distribution of the photon beam depends sensitively on the conversion distance due to non - zero angles of photon - electron beam scattering .",
    "the conversion distance is the distance from the laser and electron beam intersection point to the final interaction point .",
    "the luminosity distribution depends also on the electron beam size and shape . assuming round gaussian linac beams , the luminosity spectrum is characterized by a geometrical factor @xmath58 , the ratio of the intrinsic transverse spread of the photon beam to that of the original one : @xmath59    l9.cm    here @xmath60 is the conversion distance and @xmath61 is defined by the electron beam energy , @xmath62 . in fig.1 the spectral luminosities for unpolarized photon and electron beams are presented for different values of @xmath58 are presented .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 is the ratio of the number of electrons scattered on the laser beam to the number of electrons in each electron bunch . with @xmath58 increasing",
    "the spectral density becomes narrower and more energetic photons dominate , meanwhile the total photon photon luminosity is decreasing . to achieve a maximum @xmath0 production cross section the geometrical factor @xmath58 should be as small as possible",
    "however , in this case the transverse separation of the electron and the secondary photon beams becomes impossible and large background is expected from the process @xmath64 with the subsequent decays of @xmath65 quarks into @xmath0 .",
    "hence we use @xmath66 which is small enough to achieve an observable @xmath0 production cross section ( see below ) as well as large enough to eliminate electron - photon collision background @xcite .    .",
    "@xmath0 production cross sections in direct @xmath20 interaction at plc for @xmath67 gev and @xmath68 gev .",
    "the cross sections are calculated for two different values of the geometrical factor @xmath690 and 0.6 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     fig.4 presents the @xmath0 production cross section resulting from the radiative decays of the @xmath47 state .",
    "the cross sections are calculated with an angular cut @xmath70 . at subleading order in the relative velocity expansion",
    ", @xmath71 , only one color octet state,@xmath11 , contributes to the production of @xmath47 ( the corresponding color octet long distance parameter was extracted only from the tevatron data @xcite ) .",
    "the next corrections are already of order @xmath72 @xcite . in fig.4 the color octet (",
    "dashed - dotted line ) and color singlet ( dotted line ) contributions to @xmath47 meson production are presented .",
    "in the present paper we consider @xmath0 meson production at plc .",
    "we calculated cross sections for the production of different color octet and color singlet heavy quark - antiquark states in direct and resolved photon processes . in the resolved photon subprocesses already at the lowest order of perturbative qcd",
    "the diagrams arise which lead to the non decreasing production cross sections for some quark - antiquark states with increasing photon - photon c.m.s .",
    "energy .",
    "the contribution of color octet states to @xmath0 production is dominating .",
    "it was shown that at large @xmath10 ( @xmath1 gev ) the main contribution to @xmath0 production comes from the @xmath11 state .",
    "the cross section is even at such values of transverse momentum large enough to observe several hundred @xmath0 s through the leptonic decay channel at a projected plc luminocity @xmath2 .",
    "this should allow to extract the value of the corresponding matrix element .",
    "the cross section at smaller values of transverse momenta can also give valuable information about the color octet long distance matrix elements .",
    "the production cross section of @xmath0 mesons through @xmath47 states was also calculated .",
    "it is worth mentioning that background from @xmath73-quark decays are smaller or at same order as direct @xmath0 production @xcite but the analysis of possible backgrounds and ways of their rejection are subject of an additional study .",
