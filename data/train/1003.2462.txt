    "the detection of gravity waves ( gws ) generated during a scalar sector s first order phase transition ( pt ) represents an interesting future possibility @xcite . during a first order pt ,",
    "bubbles of true vacuum nucleate , stir up the cosmological fluid , and collide , producing gws .",
    "first order pts at the electroweak scale in particular have received much attention because of their possible connection to a well motivated electroweak baryogenesis scenario in which the baryon asymmetry is generated during an electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) @xcite .",
    "studies of this scenario are particularly timely given that tevatron and the lhc are actively probing the higgs sector responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking . if the higgs boson or any degree of freedom that can be responsible for a first order pt at the electroweak scale is found in the ongoing experiments , future experiments may eventually be able to measure all of the parameters necessary to give an accurate prediction for the gws .",
    "it is important to emphasize that even if the electroweak symmetry breaking is not a first order pt , a typical beyond the standard model scalar sector has multiple degrees of freedom , and some of these can undergo a first order pt at a temperature near the electroweak scale .",
    "just as the relative isotope abundance measurements have led to a constraint on the expansion rate during big bang nucleosynthesis , the measurement of gws may allow us to constrain any non - standard expansion rate during the time of ewpt .",
    "several detailed computations of the gravity wave spectrum exist , and each give varying degrees of dependence on the hubble expansion rate .",
    "however , to our knowledge , previous work does not sufficiently discuss the general dependence of the hubble expansion rate to directly answer the following question : how would the observed gravity wave spectrum change if the hubble expansion during the ewpt was changed from that of pure relativistic degrees of freedom ?",
    "we compute a simple transformation rule for the gravitational wave spectrum in terms of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the expansion rate which assumes radiation domination and @xmath2 is the actual expansion rate:@xmath3 where @xmath4 is the spectrum computed assuming radiation domination .",
    "this immediately implies the following : 1 ) the peak frequency of the spectrum will shift from the standard scenario frequency @xmath5 as @xmath6 , and 2 ) the peak amplitude of the spectrum will be suppressed from the standard scenario amplitude @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "the intuition for the amplitude is that less source contributes to the gravitational wave at a typical spacetime point today because of the smaller intersection of the past null boundary with the approximately compact time support of the source .",
    "the intuition for the frequency shift is that all conformal symmetry breaking scales relevant for the observable frequency range is controlled by the hubble expansion rate .",
    "we then apply this scaling relationship to the results of @xcite to compute how the gravity wave spectrum will transform due to the assumption of the existence of a quintessence kination dominated phase @xcite .",
    "such assumptions are interesting because as pointed out by @xcite ( related scenarios were also suggested before by @xcite ) , the freeze - out abundance of thermal relics can be strongly enhanced in scenarios in which the energy density is dominated by the kinetic energy of the quintessence field ( kination domination ) during the time of freeze - out , but dilutes away by the time of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "such kination dominated freeze - out scenarios are then consistent with standard cosmology and predict that the standard relic abundance computed from the parameters extracted from collider measurements will be mismatched from the relic abundance deduced by observational cosmology .",
    "thus , this scenario has interesting implications for physics models with thermal dark matter candidates ( e.g. models with low energy supersymmetry such as the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , technicolor models , models with large / warped extra dimensions , or certain classes of little higgs models ) , which will be probed at the lhc and other experiments in the foreseeable future ( for collider implications of this class of models , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out by @xcite , large annihilation cross sections compatible with the dark matter explanation of the excess positrons @xcite can be compatible with the right thermal relic abundance since the effective boost factor coming from the kination scenario can easily be as large as @xmath9 .",
    "finally , since the measurement of cmb b - mode polarization can almost model independently falsify this scenario , this scenario can be nontrivially checked with a variety of probes . in particular , the ewpt gravity wave probe in conjunction with dark matter cosmology can represent a smoking gun probe of the scenario if the gravity wave is measurable @xcite and colliders can eventually measure the requisite short - distance parameters with sufficient accuracy .",

    "we then conclude with a summary .",
    "the appendices contain some of the details used throughout the paper .",

    "in this section , we compute how the gravitational wave spectrum will transform under the situation that during the last part of the pt , the hubble expansion rate is @xmath12 where @xmath1 is what the expansion rate would be in the `` usual '' radiation domination epoch .",
    "because the main arguments rely only on the general form of the gravity wave equation and dimensional analysis , the transformation results will be very robust and nearly model independent . in a latter section",

    "although this result in some sense has been reported in the literature indirectly before ( as we survey below ) , one of the points of this study is to examine the robustness of the relationship and to spell out the assumptions necessary .    from this equation ,",
    "we can thus extract two easy to remember features :    1 .",
    "if the peak frequency without quintessence is @xmath66 , the new peak frequency is at @xmath67 .",
    "this is intuitive from recognizing that a smaller bubble length scale results if the expansion is faster ( corresponding to @xmath68 ) since the bubble length scale has a smaller time to grow before the pt is completed .",
    "2 .   the amplitude of the spectrum at the peak should decrease as @xmath69 compared to case with @xmath70 .",
    "the intuition for this result is that less source contributes to the gravitational wave at a fixed point because of the past minkowski null boundary and the approximately compact time support of the source .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum shift ] ) is essentially a classical dimensional analysis coming from the assumptions summarized by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sizeofbubble ] ) and ( [ eq : dependenceontstar ] ) , and the result is useful in allowing us to read off how the gravity wave spectrum depends on the general assumptions of the hubble expansion during the pt . as we shall see in the literature survey ,",
    "the details of the spectrum for frequencies larger than the peak frequency is difficult to compute and very uncertain .",
    "nonetheless , we will show in sections [ sec : survey ] and [ sec : caveat ] that our scaling arguments above are robust , and eq .  ( [ eq : spectrum shift ] ) will most likely apply to improved spectra that will be derived by all future more accurate computational techniques .    note that the amplitude dependence on the fluid energy @xmath24 written in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectralchange ] ) in a very intuitive form is a bit misleading since it naively looks as one can increase the amplitude of the gravity wave by increasing this quantity .",
    "however , since @xmath24 scales as the radiation energy density , when the gravity wave energy density is compared with the radiation energy density , one power of it is normalized away .",
    "the second power of @xmath24 actually represents the clock units with which to measure @xmath71 since when divided by @xmath72 , it represents the approximate expansion rate squared of a radiation dominated universe .",
    "hence , it is not really the absolute magnitude of @xmath24 that is important for increasing the measurable gravity wave amplitude but the dimensionless quantity @xmath73 . as we will see explicitly in sec .",
    "[ sec : kinationdominationexample ] , obtaining a spectrum observable at the lisa experiment will require the duration @xmath74 of the pt to be of the same order of magnitude as the expansion rate determined by the radiation energy density during the pt .",
    "physically , this effectively corresponds to a sufficiently large potential barrier suppressing bubble nucleation such that a non - negligible supercooling occurs before the pt completes .",
    "although somewhat tangential to the point of our paper , we discuss this issue a bit further in sec .",
    "[ sec : kinationdominationexample ] and appendix [ sec : tdepofs3 ] .",
    "although our next goal is to utilize eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum shift ] ) to make predictions for the quintessence kination dominated scenario , we will in the next section first check the consistency of our result with some of the explicit computations in the literature .",
    "there , we will also consider turbulence contributions to the gravity wave production and show that even when the turbulent source is long lived , its dominant contribution will be from the phase transition time period , allowing eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum shift ] ) to remain a good approximation .",
    "if the reader is not interested in the consistency check , the reader is encouraged to skip to sec .",
    "[ sec : kinationdominationexample ] .",
    "in this section , we will survey the literature which computes the gravity wave spectrum using both simulations and analytic techniques @xcite .",
    "our aim is to show that our scaling assumptions resulting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum shift ] ) are consistent with the existing explicit computations",
    ".    references @xcite find the following generic result regarding gws generated from bubble collision .",
    "the spectrum is found to have a rising and a falling shape , where the increasing side of the spectrum scales as @xmath75 and the peak position is at a wave vector of order of @xmath76 ( @xmath77 is the typical bubble size at the end of the pt ) .",
    "physically , one can attribute the @xmath75 scaling law to the compactness of the sources and the spatial homogeneity of their distribution . at the same time",
    ", one can understand the appearance of the conformal symmetry breaking scale @xmath76 as being the only identifiable classical length scale in the problem .",
    "while there is no well known uncertainty about the rising part of the spectrum @xcite , there is a large uncertainty associated with the falling part ( uv part ) of the spectrum .",
    "direct simulations find that it scales as @xmath78@xcite , while the analytic calculations give model - dependent results @xcite .",
    "in addition to bubble collisions , turbulent motion of the fluid during the ewpt will also generate gws @xcite .",
    "one can estimate the turbulence spectrum with either dimensional analysis or the velocity correlation function @xcite .",
    "it is possible that fluid turbulence and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence can contribute to gw production as much as bubble collisions .",
    "we now consider the details below .",
    "gw generation from bubble collisions in zero temperature vacuum has been extensively studied by kosowsky et al .",
    "each bubble is represented as an @xmath79 kink solution to the scalar field ( @xmath80 ) equation of motion .",
    "the latent energy released in the phase transition is turned into the bubble wall s gradient energy @xmath81 and kinetic energy @xmath82 . using numerical simulations",
    ", it is found that the gw spectrum depends primarily on the large scale features of the source .",
    "specifically , a model of the source s stress energy tensor which ignores the collision region between the two bubbles still results in a gw spectrum that is almost identical to the one from a full simulation .",
    "this `` envelope approximation '' when applied to many bubbles collisions @xcite ( @xmath83 ) results in a gw spectrum characterized by a peak frequency and a ratio of gw total energy over the released latent energy as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a parameter controlling the bubble nucleation rate @xmath86 as in @xmath87 , and @xmath85 is related to the pt duration by @xmath88 . upon going through their arguments",
    ", one can show that @xmath35 ( hubble expansion rate at the time of the pt ) in this equation can be seen to be a reparameterization of radiation temperature @xmath89 rather than the expansion rate of the universe itself . dependence . ] hence , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vacuumbubblescaling ] ) is consistent with our result that the fraction of the energy of the gw is proportional to the pt duration @xmath90 .",
    "a statistical approach is also considered in @xcite , where the gravity wave spectrum is computed as an incoherent sum over individual bubbles weighted by the bubble size distribution function . in the many bubble case ,",
    "the high frequency part of the spectrum is enhanced by the multiplicity of small bubbles .",
    "building on the zero temperature work , the finite temperature situation is studied in @xcite .",
    "finite temperature modifies the higgs boson s effective potential and introduces a fluid dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "if the pt produces large latent heat , the bubble wall velocity would be supersonic , leading to a process called detonation .",
    "as the detonation front expands , the fluid that is swept by the front is being compressed and dragged along ( see @xcite for details of computing the single bubble s velocity profile and temperature profile ) . a full simulation of two bubble collision is computationally difficult , due to the chaotic fluid motion and the wide range of length scales involved . to circumvent",
    "this difficulty , `` envelope approximation '' is again applied , resulting in the following total gw energy fraction and peak frequency @xcite :    @xmath91    where @xmath27 is the detonation front s velocity , @xmath92 is the phase transition temperature , and @xmath93 is the relativistic degree of freedom during the ewpt . here @xmath94 is the ratio of vacuum energy density to the radiation energy density , which characterizes the strength of the pt .",
    "the variable @xmath95 is an efficiency factor quantifying the fraction of the available vacuum energy that goes into the kinetic motion of the fluid .",
    "evidently , the gw spectrum s amplitude and peak position have the same scaling dependence on @xmath85 as the zero temperature case , which is consistent with our scaling result since @xmath85 quantifies @xmath96 while @xmath97 here represents the radiation energy density and not the total expansion rate .",
    "( even though @xmath35 here corresponds to @xmath98 in other sections of the paper , we maintain the original literature s notation in this survey section to emphasize the non - transparency of the scaling relationship in the literature . )",
    "hence , if exotic fluid component contributions to the stress tensor increase the expansion rate during the pt keeping the temperature fixed , then the scaling can be read off from the existing literature by scaling with @xmath85 . in that sense , the change in the peak position and amplitude resulting from our eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum shift ] ) is not particularly new . on the other hand ,",
    "the robustness of this simple scaling relationship for the entire observable spectrum and its application to the kination dominated quintessence scenario have not been explored before this paper , to our knowledge .",
    "generalizing the two bubble collision simulation to many bubbles ( @xmath99 @xcite , the gw spectrum s high frequency part is found to be enhanced from @xmath100 to @xmath78 , again due to the small bubble effect at the end of phase transition .",
    "reference @xcite uses the stochasticity of the source to estimate the gravity wave s spectrum .",
    "two assumptions are made about the velocity field in the bubble collision :    1 .",
    "the velocity field s distribution is approximately gaussian , i.e. the four points correlator @xmath101 is determined by the two point correlator@xmath102 .",
    "2 .   the two point correlator @xmath103 is nonzero if @xmath104 and @xmath105 can belong to the same bubble .",
    "the following spectrum is thereby obtained : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the ratio of bubble wall thickness to radius and @xmath108 is a dimensionless wave - number . and",
    "@xmath109 interchangeably in the gw spectrum . ]",
    "since the amplitude contains the factor @xmath110 , and the frequency dependence is through a function of @xmath111 ( where @xmath112 is the typical length scale at the end of the stirring phase ) , the spectrum s parametric scaling is consistent with our scaling rule result in eq.([eq : spectrum shift ] ) .",
    "as the thermal bubbles percolate , the fluid within the bubbles collides and generates turbulence . even though a detailed simulation of turbulence s evolution is difficult , some statistical features can be derived from dimensional analysis and intuition .",
    "generally , the turbulence contains eddies of different sizes , as the larger ones break down to smaller ones , energy is also cascaded down to smaller scales . in a fully developed turbulence ,",
    "the standard intuitive assumptions are that the energy cascade rate is a constant over time and is also a constant for different scales @xcite .",
    "for example , if the cascade rate @xmath113 were not constant on different scales , there can not be a steady state since energy would be building up at a particular length scale .",

    ", the dissipation effect becomes increasingly important , and the energy dissipation rate per unit mass is given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the kinematic viscosity . if @xmath115 is decreased to the point that the energy dissipation rate equals the energy cascade rate , the turbulence would cease to exist .",
    "this scale is the kolmogorov microscale @xmath121 : @xmath122 where the dimensionless reynolds number @xmath123 relate the largest scale @xmath114 and the smallest scale @xmath121 . in the case of ewpt , the reynolds number is usually on order of @xmath124 , causing @xmath121 to be negligible compared to @xmath114 , indeed .",

    "the possible scales include the bubble wall thickness , the correction to the energy density due to bubble interactions , and the dissipation scale associated with turbulence .    the bubble wall thickness is usually defined near the phase boundary where the energy is concentrated . in the vacuum bubble case ,",
    "the most prevalently nucleated higgs bubble solutions are believed to be described by @xmath79 symmetric solutions @xmath208 which are functions of @xmath209 . in the lab frame",
    "the bubble wall s thickness will contract towards zero as the bubble wall velocity approaches the speed of light .",
    "thus the bubble wall thickness is very small compared to the bubble radius . in the thermal bubble case , the energy is modeled to be contained in the fluid s kinetic energy rather than in the higgs field s profile . here",
    "the bubble wall is defined by the portion of fluid having large enough velocity to give an appreciable contribution to gw .",
    "steinhardt @xcite showed that there is a large class of solutions in which the fluid s speed only depends on parameter @xmath210 , i.e. as the bubble expands the velocity profile would expand accordingly .",
    "therefore the bubble wall thickness is proportional to the bubble size , and in particular , it is not a scale independent of the hubble rate .",
    "next we would like to consider the effect of small scale physics in the bubble collision case .",
    "we will show below that the dimensionless gravitational wave spectrum @xmath211 in the @xmath140 range of interest for bbo and lisa depends appreciably only on the dimensionless combinations @xmath212 where @xmath36 is the time of the pt , @xmath92 is the temperature at the time of the pt which is assumed to depend only on the short distance physics parameters @xmath213 as far as the conformal symmetry breaking parameters are concerned , and @xmath214 is the duration of the pt proportional to the inverse hubble expansion rate at the time of the phase transition . since the last of these parameters do not scale with the hubble expansion rate , the conclusion of our paper is robust if eq .",
