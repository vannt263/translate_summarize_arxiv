    "the oscillating cantilever driven adiabatic reversals ( oscar ) technique in magnetic resonance force microscopy ( mrfm ) introduced in @xcite has been used to successfully detect a single electron spin below the surface of a solid @xcite . in the oscar mrfm technique",
    "the vibrations of the cantilever tip ( ct ) with an attached ferromagnetic particle in presence of a _ rf _ magnetic field cause the periodic reversals of the effective magnetic field acting on the single electron spin .",
    "if the conditions of adiabatic motion are satisfied the spin follows the effective magnetic field .",
    "the back action of the spin on the ct causes a small frequency shift of the ct vibrations , which can be measured with high precision .",
    "the quasiclassical theory of oscar mrfm has been developed in @xcite .",
    "this theory contains two important limitations .",
    "first , it assumes that the external magnetic field @xmath0 at the spin is much greater than the dipole field @xmath1 produced by the ferromagnetic particle . in real experiments , in order to increase the frequency shift @xmath2 , one has to decrease the distance between the ct and the spin to values where the dipole field becomes sometimes greater than the external field@xcite .",
    "second , it was assumed in @xcite that the spin is located in the plane of the cantilever vibrations .",
    "thus , the quasiclassical theory should be extended in order to describe both an arbitrary relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 and an arbitrary location of the spin .",
    "this extension is presented in our paper .",
    "a single spin is a quantum object which must be described using quantum theory .",
    "the quantum theory of oscar mrfm has been developed in @xcite with the same limitations as the quasiclassical theory .",
    "it was found , as may be expected , that the frequency shift @xmath2 in quantum theory may assume only two values @xmath3 corresponding to the two directions of the spin relative to the effective magnetic field .",
    "the value of @xmath4 in quantum theory is the same as the maximum frequency shift calculated using quasiclassical theory ( where it can take any value between @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , to calculate the quantum frequency shift , it is reasonable to use quasiclassical instead of quantum theory .",

    "( @xmath35 is the absolute value of the gyromagnetic ratio ) .",
    "we ignore the transverse components of the dipole field @xmath1 because they represent the fast oscillating terms in the rotating system of coordinate .",
