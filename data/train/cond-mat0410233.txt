    "in this section , we will show the calculation of the effective action and the mqt rate for the @xmath4-wave phase qubit ( the current biased @xmath14-axis twist josephson junction  @xcite ) . in fig.1 , we show schematic of this junction . in this figure , @xmath13 is the twist angle about the @xmath14-axis ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "such a junction was recently fabricated by using the single crystal whisker of bi@xmath16sr@xmath16cacu@xmath16o@xmath17 .",
    "takano @xmath18 measured the twist angle dependence of the @xmath14-axis josephson critical current and showed a clear evidence of the @xmath19 symmetry of the pair potential .",
    "@xcite in the following , we assume that the tunneling between the two superconductors is described in terms of the coherent tunneling ( @xmath20 ) . for simplicity , we also assume that each superconductors consist of single cuo@xmath16 layer , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , we consider the low temperature limit ( @xmath23 ) .    by using the functional integral method , the ground partition function for the system",
    "can be written as follows @xmath24}{\\hbar }   \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the phase difference across the junction . in this equation ,",
    "the effective action is given by @xmath26 & = & \\int_{0}^{\\hbar \\beta } d \\tau   \\left [     \\frac{m}{2 }      \\left (     \\frac{\\partial \\phi ( \\tau ) } { \\partial \\tau }     \\right)^2     +      u(\\phi ) \\right ] + s^{[\\alpha]}[\\phi ] , \\nonumber\\\\ \\\\ s^{[\\alpha]}[\\phi ] & = & - \\int_{0}^{\\hbar \\beta }   d \\tau    \\int_{0}^{\\hbar \\beta } d \\tau '    \\alpha ( \\tau - \\tau ' ) \\cos \\frac{\\phi(\\tau ) - \\phi ( \\tau ' ) } { 2 }    , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the mass and @xmath28 is the tiled washboard potential @xmath29 in this equation , @xmath30 is the josephson coupling energy , @xmath31 is the josephson critical current , and @xmath32 is the external current .    in the following",
    ", we will consider the effect of the nodal quasiparticles on mqt .",
    "for this purpose , we first calculate the dissipation kernel @xmath33 for two types of the @xmath14-axis junction , @xmath34 . , ( 1 ) @xmath35 and ( 2 ) @xmath36 ( here we will show the result for @xmath37 case only . ) .    in the case of the @xmath14-axis junction with @xmath35 ,",
    "the nodes of the pair potential in the two superconductors are in the same direction .",
    "therefore , the node - to - node quasiparticle tunneling is possible even at very low temperatures . in this case",
    ", the asymptotic form of the dissipation kernel at the zero temperature is given by @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "this gives the super - ohmic dissipation .    on the other hand , in the case of the finite twist angle ( @xmath40 ) ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the dissipation kernel is given by an exponential function due to the suppression of the node - to - node quasiparticle tunneling , @xmath41 @xmath42 for @xmath39 .",
    "the mqt rate at the zero temperature is given by  @xcite    @xmath43    where @xmath44 $ ] is the bounce exponent , that is the value of the the action @xmath45 evaluated along the bounce trajectory @xmath46 .",
    "using the instanton method , we obtain the analytic expressions for the mqt rate : @xmath47 , \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\gamma(\\pi/8)}{\\gamma_0(\\pi/8 ) } & \\approx &   \\exp    \\left [      - b\\left(\\pi/8 \\right ) \\right ] , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "where , @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the decay rate without the quasiparticle dissipation . in eq.(10 ) , @xmath50 is the renormalization mass . as an example , for @xmath51 mev ,  @xcite @xmath52 a , @xmath53 ff , and @xmath54 , we obtain @xmath55 therefore , the node - to - node quasiparticle tunneling in the case of the @xmath35 junction gives rise to large reduction of the mqt rate in compared with the @xmath40 case .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated the effect of quasiparticle dissipation for the d - wave phase qubit ( @xmath14-axis twist josephson junction ) . within the coherent tunneling approximation",
    ", we find the super - ohmic dissipation in the case of the zero twist angle qubit .",
    "this dissipation is caused by the node - to - node quasiparticle tunneling between the two superconductors .",
    "therefore , in this case , the fidelity of the readout process is very low . on the other hand , in the case of the finite twist angle qubit ,",
    "the suppression of the mqt rate is very weak in compared with the @xmath56 case due to the inhibition of the node - to - node quasiparticle tunneling .",
    "this gives the high - fidelity readout for the @xmath4-wave phase qubit .",
