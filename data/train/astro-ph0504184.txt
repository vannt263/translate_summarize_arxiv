    "since their discovery , grbs turned out to be incredibly powerful sources , with detected fluences up to @xmath2 erg/@xmath3 in the @xmath4ray band , above few tens of kev .",
    "the first spectroscopic measurements of their redshifts ( e.g.@xcite ) , besides confirming their cosmological nature , indicated that these events release , in the @xmath4ray band , a huge amount of energy , up to @xmath5 erg .",
    "this extraordinary energetic content became a challenge for the proposed grb models .",
    "one implicit hypothesis in deriving the grb energy , from the observed fluence and measured redshift , consisted in assuming that grbs emit isotropically . however , it was suggested  @xcite that grbs might be collimated into a cone of semiaperture @xmath6 .",
    "the jet opening angle could be directly estimated , under some simplifying assumptions on few other parameters , from the measure of the achromatic break time @xmath7 in the afterglow light curve @xcite .",
    "the presence of a jet in grb outflows , supported by observations in most events @xcite , allowed to correct the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath8 for the collimation factor , therefore obtaining the collimation corrected energy @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these results suggested that grbs might have a unique energy @xmath10 erg .",
    "the study of the rest frame spectral properties of a sample of @xmath11sax grbs @xcite ( see also @xcite ) led to the discovery of a correlation between the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath8 and the @xmath12 spectral peak energy , @xmath13 ( the amati correlation ) .    with the largest sample of bursts with spectroscopically measured redshifts , published spectra and well determined jet break time , we estimated the jet opening angles and derived @xmath14 .",
    "we discovered a very tight correlation between @xmath14 and the spectral peak energy @xmath15 @xcite ( the ghirlanda correlation ) .",
    "this correlation relates the grb prompt emission energy ",
    "properly corrected for the burst geometry  to its peak frequency .",
    "it might be the key to understand some still obscure aspects of the physics and origin of grbs . besides , its small scatter and good powerlaw fit allowed to use , for the first time , grbs as standard candles to constrain the cosmological parameters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we collected all the grbs with redshift measurements and published spectral parameters . in most cases the spectrum is represented by the empirical band function .",
    "the spectrum allows to compute the burst bolometric fluence @xmath17 ( i.e. the time integrated flux ) and , hence , the isotropic equivalent energy , i.e. @xmath18 . the jet break time , typically observed between 0.1 and 10 days since the burst trigger , is due to the deceleration , by the external ism , of the grb relativistic fireball .",
    "when the lorentz factor of the fireball is @xmath19 a change in the time decay slope of the afterglow flux is observed .",
    "this characteristic time depends also on the ism density @xmath20 and on the kinetic energy which is still in the fireball after the prompt emission phase ( parametrized through the efficiency @xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore , the measure of @xmath22 allows to estimate @xmath23 .",
    "after the publication of the original work of ggl04 , the redshifts and spectral parameters of four more bursts were published .",
    "we present here the updated correlations ( either @xmath13@xmath8 and @xmath13@xmath14 ) .",
    "a continuously updated version of the correlations and the relative tables can be found at http://www.merate.mi.astro.it/@xmath24ghirla/deep/blink.htm ( with the complete reference list ) .",
    "we use @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the grbs added to the original sample of 23 ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) are :    * grb  021004 @xcite , with a rest frame peak energy @xmath27 kev and @xmath28 erg .",
    "the jet break time is @xmath29 days , the jet opening angle @xmath30 and , therefore , @xmath31 erg .",
    "* grb  030323 @xcite , with a rest frame peak energy @xmath32 kev and @xmath33 erg .",
    "the afterglow light curve is relatively flat i.e. indicating a jet break time @xmath34 days , implying @xmath35 and , therefore , @xmath36 erg .",
    "* grb  040924 @xcite , with a rest frame peak energy of @xmath37 kev and @xmath38 erg .",
    "the afterglow light curve is relatively flat [ @xmath39 up to 1 day , indicating a jet break time @xmath40 day , implying @xmath41 and , therefore , @xmath42 erg .",
    "* grb  041006 @xcite , with a rest frame peak energy @xmath43 kev and @xmath44 erg .",
    "the jet break time is @xmath45 days , implying @xmath46 and , therefore , @xmath47 erg .",
    "we added the four grbs to the 23 grbs of tab.1 and 2 of ggl04 . in fig .",
    "1 we report the updated correlations . with 27 grbs ( black symbols is fig .",
    "1 ) the best fit powerlaw ( weighting for the errors on both coordinates ) of the @xmath13@xmath8 correlation is : @xmath48 with a reduced @xmath49 ( long dashed line in fig .",
    "the least square fit to the same data points ( i.e. ignoring the errors on the two coordinates ) gives a slope of 0.41@xmath500.05 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "the ghirlanda @xmath13@xmath14 correlation , updated with two of the four grbs with known @xmath6 ( green filled symbols in fig .",
    "1 ) , is : @xmath51 with a reduced @xmath52 ( solid line in fig . 1 , shaded region is the uncertainty of this correlation ) .",
    "least square fit gives a slightly flatter slope of 0.6 .",
    "the present gaussian fit of the distribution of the perpendicular scatter of the 27 grb around their best fit ( eq .",
    "1 ) is @xmath53 .",
    "the scatter of the ghirlanda correlation ( eq .",
    "2 ) , instead , is only @xmath54 ( i.e. consistent with what found with the 15 grbs in ggl04 ) .",
    "we stress that the ghirlanda correlation is well fitted ( also with the 2 new grbs ) by a single powerlaw and that its slope , 0.69 , is consistent with what found with the 15 grbs in ggl04 .",
    "moreover , the reduced @xmath55 allows its use in cosmology ( gglf04 , ggf05 and @xcite ) .",
    "this is in net contrast with what claimed by @xcite who find @xmath56 for the @xmath0@xmath14 fit .",
    "although the authors do not investigate the reason of their statistically unacceptable results , we note that their severe underestimation of the uncertainty on two relevant parameters ( i.e. the ism density and the jet break time ) is driving their conclusions .",
    "they assume , when unknown , an ism density with an uncertainty of 50% .",
    "this parameter is highly uncertain due to the few measured values ( and also in these few cases highly debated ) . until precise measurements of this parameter",
    "will not be available , it is preferable to let it vary within a relatively large range .",
    "this is indeed what ggl04 did in their original work ( where @xmath57 ) .",
    "moreover , in @xcite a few jet break times are reported with unreliably small errors ( down to 1% ) .",
    "this means that for some grbs we could determine a break in their light curves at  say  1.5 days with an uncertainty of 28 minutes ( e.g. grb  011211 ) , which may be a challenge for the future but which was extremely hard in the past afterglow observational campaigns .",
    "we have presented the updated ghirlanda correlation with 17 grbs with firm redshift measurements and published spectral parameters .",
    "these 2 more events perfectly fit the ghirlanda correlation as found by ggl04 . while waiting for future events , even the present small sample of grbs have important and intriguing implications for the use of grbs as standard candles to measure our universe .",
    "we thank annalisa celotti & fabrizio tavecchio for useful discussions .",
