    "the three classical white dwarfs were , at the beginning of the twentieth century , , , and the . although @xmath3  eri  b had been discovered by herschel ( 1785 ) and sirius  b had been predicted by bessel ( 1844 ) , it was not until the 1920s when other great astronomers noticed their oddness ( luyten 1922 ) and popularized the term `` white dwarf '' ( eddington 1924 ) .",
    "the extreme physical conditions by which the white dwarfs are supported against gravitational collapse could not be understood until the quantum mechanic was properly developed . since the 1930s ,",
    "the number of known white dwarfs has exponentially increased , from 18 in 1939 ( schatzman 1958 ) and over a hundred in 1950 ( luyten 1950 ) to a few thousands at present ( mccook & sion 1999 ; eisenstein et al . 2006 ) .",
    "see liebert ( 1980 ) , koester ( 2002 ) and hansen & liebert ( 2003 ) for extensive reviews of the general properties of white  dwarfs .",
    "the vast majority of the known white dwarfs are very faint , with typical magnitudes in the optical from @xmath4 = 15 to 20mag , or even fainter .",
    "only a few very bright white dwarfs ( @xmath5 12mag ) , including the three classical white dwarfs and , are known .",
    "many of them , especially those that are not in double degenerate systems , are extensively used as spectrophotometric stars ( see , e.g. , the recent catalogue by landolt & uomoto 2007 ) . except for rare exceptions , as the very hot dwarfs and cataclysmic variables found in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey of extreme - ultraviolet sources by pounds et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , all the very bright white dwarfs were discovered during photometric and astrometric surveys before the early 70s ( e.g. kuiper 1941 ; luyten 1949 ; thackeray 1961 ; eggen & greenstein 1965 ; giclas , burnham & thomas 1965 ; schwartz 1972 ) .",
    "afterwards , and in particular with the advent of the sloan digital sky survey , the detection of new white dwarfs and blue subdwarfs has been biased towards magnitudes fainter than @xmath4 = 12mag .",
    "because of that , the photometry - based discovery of a very bright white dwarf candidate 35 years later would be outstanding .",
    "if confirmed , it would yield doubts on the real knowledge that we have of the solar neighbourhood and on the completeness of previous and current surveys for white  dwarfs .    in this work we present , a previously - unknown very bright ( @xmath6 = 11.80@xmath10.14mag ) white dwarf candidate .",
    "its finding chart is provided in  fig .",

    "albus  1 was serendipitously discovered during an optical - near infrared photometric study by caballero & solano ( 2007 ) , devoted to characterize the young stars and brown dwarfs surrounding ( @xmath7  ori ) and ( @xmath8  ori ) . as part of this study",
    ", they made a correlation between the tycho-2 ( hg et al .",
    "2000 ) and the 2mass ( cutri et al . 2003 ) catalogues in ten 45arcmin - radius comparison fields at the same galactic latitude of the brightest stars of the young association ( the orion belt ; @xmath9 17.5deg ) .",
    "the total investigated area was only 17.7deg@xmath10 ( @xmath110.04% of the whole sky ) .",
    "albus  1 has a @xmath2 color that clearly deviates from those of the other 1275 investigated sources ( see fig .  [ colormagnitude ] ) .",
    "in particular , while the bluest remaining sources have @xmath12 0.3mag , albus  1 has a color @xmath2 = 0.95@xmath10.14mag .",
    "the tycho-2 @xmath13 and 2mass @xmath14 photometry shows that the object is extremely blue at all the wavelenghts from 0.4 to 2.2@xmath15 m .",
    "given the extreme blueing of albus  1 , we decided to investigate it in  detail .",
    "in this work we have taken advantage of the tools offered by the virtual observatory ( vo ; http://www.ivoa.net ) , which is an international , community - based initiative to provide seamless access to the data available from astronomical archive and services .",
    "the vo also aims to provide state - of - the - art tools for the efficient analysis of this huge amount of information .",
    "in particular , we have used aladin ( http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/aladin.gml ) , a vo - compliant interactive sky atlas developed by cds that allows the user to visualize and analyze astronomical images , spectra and catalogues available from the vo  services .",
    "albus  1 has an appreciable tycho-2 proper motion of 19masa@xmath16 . since the comparison fields are relatively close to the antapex ( the point the sun is moving away from ) ,",
    "the foreground objects in this region have not very large proper motions except for some very nearby stars with large tangential velocities .",
    "indeed , the proper motion of albus  1 is in the percentile 23% of the investigated sources ( i.e. 77% of the investigated tycho-2 stars have @xmath17 19masa@xmath16 ) .",
    "this makes albus  1 to be a nearby galactic  object .",
    "apart from the coordinates , proper motion and @xmath13 magnitudes from tycho-2 and the @xmath14 magnitudes from 2mass , taken from caballero & solano ( 2007 ) , we have also collected additional photometric and astrometric data from other catalogues : supercosmos science archive ( hambly et al .",
    "2001 ) , usno - b1 ( monet et al . 2003 ) , nomad1 ( zacharias et al . 2005 ) and denis ( denis consortium 2005 ) .",
    "they nicely match between them and tycho-2 and 2mass , except for the fact that for very blue objects the tycho-2 @xmath0 and photographic @xmath18 photometry are not comparable . to avoid superfluous , repetitive information in table  [ albus1 ] , we provide only the tycho-2 and 2mass information and the @xmath19 photometric data from  usno - b1 .",
    "the search with aladin concluded that there is no radio ( nrao vla ) , mid - infrared ( @xmath20 ) , ultraviolet ( @xmath21 ) , x - ray ( @xmath22 ) source , or object discussed in the literature ( simbad ) at less than 4arcmin to albus  1 .",
    "neither spectroscopic information exists nor photometry in the johnson passbands has been obtained  yet .",
    "to ascertain the real nature of albus  1 , we must compare its photometry with that of other very blue objects .",
    "there is a limited number of galactic objects with @xmath2 colors as blue as those of albus  1 : white dwarfs , hot subdwarfs , and early - type main sequence , blue horizontal branch and population  ii stars .",
    "[ colorcolor ] compares the optical - near infrared colors of albus  1 with those of dwarf and giant stars in the direction to alnilam and mintaka .",
    "our blue source is even bluer than the late o- and early b - type stars . besides",
    ", such luminous stars are located at long heliocentric distances ( @xmath23 0.4kpc ) , which implies very low proper motions , in contrast with what we have measured for albus  1 .",
    "population  ii stars are common in the bulge near the centre of the galaxy and in the galactic halo .",
    "some of the latters cross the solar neighbourhood , but only a few of them display extremely blue colors ( see , e.g. , the recent photometric study of horizontal - branch and metal - poor candidates by beers et al .",
    "therefore , albus  1 is an early - type hot subdwarf or a white  dwarf .",
    "the extreme blueing of albus  1 prevents from transforming the @xmath13 magnitudes to johnson @xmath24 magnitudes using standard relations and , therefore , to compare its colors with other white dwarfs tabulated in exhaustive works such as in bergeron , leggett & ruiz ( 2001 ) .",
    "a new comparison may come , instead , from the available tycho-2 and 2mass data . in table",
    "[ wds ] we have compiled the basic data of the brightest white dwarfs and blue subdwarfs identified in the tycho-2 catalogue .",
    "we used the white dwarf lists by mccook & sion ( 1999 ) and holberg , oswalt & sion ( 2002 ) , and looked for the tycho-2 counterparts of the white dwarfs brighter than @xmath4 = 13.0mag .",
    "fainter objects were not considered due to their poor photometric accuracy .",
    "this list surpasses the sample of white dwarf observed by the @xmath25 satellite in vauclair et al .",
    "there are three evident absences : sirius  b , @xmath3  eri  b , and procyon  b ( the three brightest known white dwarfs ) , which are too close to other bright stars and were , thus , not identified by tycho-2 . among the tabulated objects , there is only one hot subdwarf with blue colors , gj  3435 , which indicates its  rarity .",
    "data in table  [ wds ] is represented in fig .",
    "[ colorcolor ] .",
    "albus  1 is located in the color - color diagram very close to the well known white dwarfs g  191b2b ( da1 ) and gj  433.1 ( da3 ) , at @xmath26 0.8mag , @xmath27 0.2mag .",
    "the resemblance between the spectral energy distributions of albus  1 and g  191b2b ( `` the best studied of all hot white dwarfs '' ; barstow et al .",
    "2003 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ sed ] , is evident .",
    "both of them have the same @xmath28 magnitude within the error bars ( albus  1 : @xmath28 = 12.76@xmath10.03mag ; g  191b2b : @xmath28 = 12.76@xmath10.02mag ) , but g  191b2b is 0.40@xmath10.11mag brighter in @xmath0 .",
    "it leads to tentatively classify albus  1 as an early da white dwarf slightly cooler than g  191b2b and , therefore , slightly closer to the sun . the stellar common proper - motion companion of g  191b2b has an accurate parallax determination by _ hipparcos _ at @xmath29 = 46@xmath14pc .",
    "hence , albus  1 could be located at about 40pc , which would explain its appreciable proper - motion .",
    "the probability of albus  1 being a more distant blue subdwarf is smaller ( see table  [ wds ] ) . from the blue @xmath30 color in fig .",
    "[ colorcolor ] , it is deduced , besides , that albus  1 has no main sequence close companion or forms part of a cataclysmic variable  system .",
    "as shown by salim & gould ( 2002 ) , an optical - infrared reduced proper motion digram ( e.g. @xmath31 vs. @xmath32 ) can be used to classify stars even if no parallax information is available . in particular , white dwarfs and subdwarf stars",
    "are easily distinguished from main sequence stars as they are several magnitudes dimmer at the same color .",
    "the position of albus  1 in the reduced proper motion diagram in fig .  4 in gould & morgan ( 2003 ; @xmath33 3.2@xmath10.6mag , @xmath34 = 0.76@xmath10.14mag ) agrees with this requirement .",
    "of the 30 white dwarfs and blue subdwarfs listed in table  [ wds ] , only thirteen have tycho-2 @xmath6 magnitudes brighter than 12.0mag .",
    "albus  1 , with @xmath6 = 11.80@xmath10.14mag , is included in this group .",
    "accounting for the three brightest known white dwarfs not in the table , and discarding the close binary systems bl  psc  ab , v841  ara  ab , v3885  sgr  ab , and bd+28  4211  ab , whose spectral energy distributions are affected by the main sequence close companions , then albus  1 is the 12th brightest white dwarf yet known . since six of the white dwarfs brighter than it are in multiple systems ( the binary status of gj  127.1  ab claimed by gill & kaptein 1896 is , however , not confirmed ) , then albus  1 would be the sixth brightest isolated white dwarf , after the long - time known feige  34 , l  145141 , bd07  3632 , and hd  340611 ( luyten 1949 ; eggen & greenstein 1965 ) and the very hot white dwarf and extreme ultraviolet source re  j221449 ( holberg et  al .  1993 ) .",
    "albus  1 , although located in the southern hemisphere , is visible from the most important northern observatories .",
    "this fact , together with its brightness , makes our blue source an appropiate candidate spectrophotometric standard provided that its white dwarf or hot subdwarf nature is spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "our serendipitous detection has also shown that the @xmath2 color is a good and simple discriminator to look for very blue , relatively bright objects .",
    "a search for new very bright white dwarf candidates using tycho-2 and 2mass is currently  ongoing .",
