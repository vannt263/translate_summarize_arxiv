    "the sagittarius a complex is one of the best studied regions in the sky and encompasses several interesting phenomena like the nearest supermassive nuclear black hole ( sgra * ) , the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) , star forming regions ( sfrs ) and supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the line of sight toward the sgra complex consists of the snr sgraeast in the back and the cnd ( whose ionized part is known as sgrawest ) in the front partly overlapping with sgraeast .",
    "molecular gas is abundant and well distributed ; the cnd consists of irregularly distributed clumps of molecular gas and there are two giant molecular cloud cores ( gmcs ) called the @xmath120 and @xmath2 ^ -1 kms@xmath3  clouds ( m@xmath40.13@xmath40.08 and m@xmath5 respectively ) .",
    "these gmcs form the molecular belt stretching across the sgracomplex , providing the interstellar medium ( ism ) that interacts with sgraeast . a nice and recent comprehensive overview is presented by @xcite .",
    "bright maser lines are useful probes of physical conditions within molecular clouds , especially when mapped in detail by interferometers .",
    "one example is the collisionally pumped 1720  mhz oh maser which is widely recognized as a tracer for shocked regions , observed both in sfrs and snrs . in snrs ,",
    "very large array ( vla ) observations have shown they originate in regions where the shocks collide with the interstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such oh masers are numerous in sgraeast , thus probing the conditions of the interaction regions between the @xmath2 and @xmath120 ^ -1 kms@xmath3  clouds and the snr sgraeast .",
    "dense gas structures in the galactic center region , including sgraeast , are traced by ammonia and methanol thermal emission @xcite .",
    "methanol abundances are high enough to produce maser emission . like 1720  mhz",
    "oh masers , class i methanol masers such as the 36 and 44  ghz transitions are excited through collisions .",
    "theoretical modeling of collisional oh excitation predicts that the 1720  mhz oh should be found in regions of @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8k @xcite . the number density and temperature required for 36  ghz methanol masers are near those modeled for 1720  mhz  oh masers , with @xmath9 @xmath7 and @xmath10k @xcite . at least in sfrs , higher densities and temperatures of @xmath11 @xmath7 and @xmath12k will optimize the maser output for the class i 44  ghz line , while the 36  ghz maser eventually becomes quenched @xcite . finding these methanol maser lines may therefore help to constrain the upper limit of the density in the shocked snr regions . in turn",
    "such limits can be used to estimate the importance of compression by shocks in the formation of stars near snrs .",

    "several bright masers were found near the 1720  mhz oh masers in the sgraeast molecular cloud - snr interaction region ; a feature also observed by many others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to test whether the relation between the collisionally excited 36 and 44 methanol masers and 1720  mhz  oh holds in general , we here present the result of a search for class i 44  ghz methanol maser emission in the sgra region",
    "on 2010 october 16 , the evla was used in its c configuration to observe the @xmath15 rotational transition of ch@xmath0oh at 44069.41  mhz as part of observing project 10b-146 .",
    "the complete results on all sources will be reported elsewhere ; here we concentrate on the emission detected in the sgra region . the new observation preparation tool ( opt )",
    "was used to schedule the observations with a bandwidth of 8  mhz in dual polarization .",
    "the bandwidth was split in 256 channels with a resulting velocity resolution of approximately 0.2 ^-1 kms@xmath3  over a total velocity coverage of 51 ^-1 kms@xmath3 . at the time of the observations full",
    "doppler tracking was not available , but instead the sky frequency was calculated at the beginning of each scheduling block ( observing run ) and then kept fixed throughout the observation .",
    "velocity errors due to uncorrected doppler effects over the length of a scan are much less than the channel width .",
    "we note that both maser and thermal emission may be detected when observing in the c - configuration ( see sec.[results ] ) .",
    "the primary beam at 44  ghz is about 56 , and the full sgra region could not be covered by a single pointing .",
    "we selected five pointing positions ( `` a '' through `` e '' , see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) with central velocities based on previous results on 1720  mhz oh masers and 36  ghz methanol masers .",
    "position a corresponds to a region of high - velocity 1720  mhz oh masers belonging to the circumnuclear disk , covering lsr velocities between 106 and 157 ^-1 kms@xmath3 . in position",
    "b we previously detected 36  ghz methanol masers at velocities around 23 ^-1 kms@xmath3  ( lsr coverage @xmath16 to @xmath139 ^-1 kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "this pointing position partly overlaps on the sky with pointing position c which has a central velocity of 48 ^-1 kms@xmath3  ( lsr coverage 22  74 ^-1 kms@xmath3 ) based on the 1720  mhz oh masers .",
    "finally , positions d and e correspond to a region where the 50 ^ -1 kms@xmath3  molecular cloud interacts with sgraeast , and where 1720mhz masers are numerous .",
    "the lsr velocity coverage for these pointing positions was 22  74 ^-1 kms@xmath3 .",
    "as a bonus we could include the pointing on our calibrator sgra * and investigate the same velocity ranges in this part of the sky .",
    "the data were reduced using standard procedures in aips , using 3c286 as the flux density calibrator resulting in a typical flux density uncertainty of @xmath17 . in the fields were masers were found , a strong maser channel was used for self - calibration , with its solutions applied to all channels .",
    "each cube was cleaned with robust weighting down to a level of five times the theoretical rms over a field approximately twice the primary beam .",
    "this was necessary since some masers appeared in the sidelobes and needed to be accounted for in the cleaning process .",
    "the resulting typical channel rms noise is 15  20 mjy / beam , and the restoring beam is 1.3@xmath180.5 .",
    "peak fluxes are corrected for primary beam attenuation using aips task pbcor .",
    "the image cubes were searched for masers , and parameters for the individual features were extracted using the aips task jmfit .",
    "the combined results are presented in table [ masers ] for spectral features with peak flux densities exceeding 10 times the rms noise .",
    "a few weaker masers exist in the cubes , but they are all located close to the brighter masers in position and velocity , and will not change any of the discussion in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "a few features show more than one spectral peak at a given position , implying there is structure on scales smaller than the evla beam .",
    "some spectral features have wings of weaker emission extending over 6  8 ^ -1 kms@xmath3 .",
    "since the observations were taken when the evla was in c - configuration , we suspect that some of this broad and weak emission is of thermal origin .",
    "the peak flux density of the spectral features corresponds to brightness temperatures exceeding @xmath19k , indicating that at least some of these features are masers .",
    "a definite confirmation of this needs higher angular resolution observations .",
    "however , several features are co - located spatially and spectrally with previously detected 36  ghz methanol emission confirmed to be masers @xcite .",
    "both the 44  ghz and 36  ghz masers are thought to be excited by the same process , so it is likely the 44  ghz observed here is maser emission even though a smaller fraction of the emission may be of thermal origin .",
    "three masers were detected outside the primary beam ( 2 , 13 and 16 in table [ masers ] ) and their flux density is therefore less certain than for masers located within the primary beam .",
    "the position and velocity of maser 2 at 50 ^-1 kms@xmath3  agrees very well with the position of a 36  ghz maser at 51 ^-1 kms@xmath3  @xcite , and therefore increases our confidence in this detection .",
    "this 44  ghz maser has previously been reported on by @xcite , and is associated with a molecular clump g. similarly , we confirm their maser v ( our maser 1 ) in our data taken for the phase - reference calibrator j1745@xmath42900 ( i.e.  sgra * ) , and both g and v in archival vla data taken on 2009 april 23 . the 44  ghz maser associated with clump f reported by @xcite",
    "is not confirmed by our , nor the archival , observations .",
    "the additional two masers detected outside the primary beam , 13 and 16 , also do not have 36  ghz masers directly associated with them .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] plots the position of the detected 44  ghz methanol sources compared to the previously detected 36  ghz and 1720  mhz oh masers .",
    "also indicated are the spatial regions , primary beams a through e , selected for maser searches in these observations .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the northeast region of sgraeast where most 44  ghz masers are located . from these plots",
    "a few main results can be concluded .",
    "firstly , the positions and velocities of several 44  ghz masers ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 14 , and 15 from table [ masers ] ) agree to within the errors with the values reported by @xcite for the 36  ghz masers .",
    "secondly , there is a systematic difference between the overall distributions of the 1720  mhz oh , 36  ghz methanol and 44  ghz methanol masers . in the northeast ( upper left )",
    "region , in overlap with the densest part of the 50 ^ -1 kms@xmath3  cloud , the 44  ghz masers are offset to the northeast with respect to a narrow , almost linear southsoutheast to northnorthwest distribution of the 36  ghz masers .",
    "the 1720  mhz oh masers are found on the other side of the 36  ghz masers , near the radio continuum of the snr to the southwest ( lower right ) .",
    "an offset between the oh and methanol is also observed in the southeastern interaction region , where the snr g359.020.09 overlaps the sgraeast continuum @xcite .",
    "these positional offsets are discussed further in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "to date , four collisionally excited radio frequency maser tracers have been detected in the sgra complex ; 1720  mhz oh , 36 and 44  ghz ch@xmath0oh and 22  ghz h@xmath20o @xcite .",
    "the 22  ghz water masers trace regions of higher density and temperature than are typical for the snr / cloud interaction regions , and will not be discussed in this paper . the methanol and hydroxyl",
    "are excited under similar conditions , and in this letter we discuss their relative positions and possible origins .",
    "modeling of methanol masers suggest that the 36  ghz transition occurs under somewhat cooler and less dense ( @xmath21 30  100k , @xmath22 @xmath7 ) conditions than the 44  ghz transition ( @xmath21 80  200 k , @xmath11 @xmath7 ; see , e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the range of physical conditions do however overlap , and some spatial overlap could therefore be expected .",
    "seven 44  ghz masers ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 14 and 15 ) show an almost perfect overlap in both position and velocity with 36  ghz masers @xcite . here , according to the modeling , the densities and temperatures should be close to 10@xmath23 @xmath7 and 100k to produce both methanol maser lines .",
    "it is striking that the brightest 36  ghz masers , all in positions d and e @xcite , are narrowly distributed along a line roughly from north to south , of which three coincide with 44  ghz masers ( 3 , 4 and 7 ) in position and velocity within the errors .",
    "this nnw - sse division more or less coincides with the sharp gradient in low - frequency radio continuum emission of the sgraeast snr @xcite and appears to be located in the sheath in the cs emission as mapped by @xcite .",
    "the mean velocity of each transition is 46 ^-1 kms@xmath3 , implying that they arise in similar regions of the molecular cloud where the velocities still are less disturbed by the snr shock ( see sect .",
    "[ 1720comp ] ) . apart from two individual exceptions located far from this area ( 1 and 2 )",
    ", we do not find any 44  ghz ( nor 36  ghz ) masers westward of this line in our pointings .",
    "it is therefore tempting to speculate that the line delineates the arrival of the shock front , where enough material has been swept up to provide the density for the creation of ( very bright 36 ghz ) methanol masers , but not yet enough energy has dissipated to dissociate all methanol or to significantly disturb the velocity structure by means of a reverse shock ( section [ 1720comp ] ) . that the 36  ghz masers appear to be much brighter than the 44  ghz masers",
    "may be due to the smaller synthesized beams in the 36  ghz observations ( 200 - 400 mas using b - configuration ) .",
    "however , within each observation , the masers outlining the shock front on average are at least twice as bright as the other masers in the same transition .",
    "it suggests that the geometry of the shock front , moving in the plane of the sky , causes the path length amplification to be largest in the line of sight , hence lending support to our speculation .",
    "in the northeastern part of sgraeast toward the core of the 50 ^ -1 kms@xmath3  cloud , there is a group of 44  ghz masers with a distinct positional offset from the nnw - sse line of 36  ghz masers , and which have no accompanying 36  ghz masers .",
    "the narrower distribution of 36  ghz masers suggests that the conditions required to produce masers in this transition are not fulfilled to the same extent further to the northeast .",
    "the position of the 36  ghz emission is consistent with being just in the snr / cloud interaction region , while the 44  ghz masers may be found deeper inside the denser parts of the cloud where 36  ghz masers are quenched .",
    "this situation has been found in sites of massive star formation , where the 44  ghz masers typically are brighter than the 36  ghz masers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting some of the 44  ghz masers may be associated with star formation . the lack of companion 36  ghz masers in this putative star - forming region in the northeast corner of sgraeast ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) therefore may be due to the limited sensitivity of the 36  ghz observations .",
    "this picture , at least for this region in the galactic center , in which 44  ghz masers are primarily associated with cloud cores and 36  ghz masers are found at the boundaries of the snr interaction regions , is consistent with theoretical models indicating that 44  ghz masers can be produced at higher densities than 36  ghz masers .",
    "the existence of 36  ghz masers without accompanying 44  ghz masers in positions b and c may then indicate the interaction region of two snrs without the presence of a dense cloud core .      as is the case with class i methanol masers , 1720  mhz oh masers are used as tracers of shocked regions .",
    "the presence of 1720  mhz oh masers indicates the presence of c - shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "modeling of oh and ch@xmath0oh shows that the three maser transitions discussed here require similar densities and temperatures .",
    "this agrees well with the detection of all three masers in sgraeast .",
    "however , we observe a distinct offset in positions between the methanol and oh masers ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in the northeast interaction region between the 50 ^ -1 kms@xmath3  cloud and sgraeast the oh masers",
    "are found more to the southwest .",
    "in addition , the 1720  mhz oh masers have a slightly higher mean velocity of 57  ^-1 kms@xmath3  versus 46  ^-1 kms@xmath3  for the methanol .",
    "we do note however , that the 1720  mhz oh does overlap in the sky with the line of 36  ghz masers .",
    "a similar offset is observed in the southeastern interaction region in pointing positions b and c , where the methanol masers are offset southwest from the oh . the oh mean velocities here are 58 ^-1 kms@xmath3  to be compared to the 24.5 ^-1 kms@xmath3  for the 36  ghz methanol .",
    "no 44  ghz methanol was detected in this region .",
    "the association between 1720  mhz oh and 36  ghz methanol emission may be due to the processes that form these molecules .",
    "oh is created by dissociation of h@xmath20o ( and maybe also ch@xmath0oh ) , and the propagation of a c - shock creates densities and temperatures suitable for 1720  mhz oh inversion and probably also some class i methanol emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , oh masers should preferentially be found in the snr post - shock region .",
    "this agrees with the oh masers being co - located with positions of radio continuum , outlining regions where electrons have been accelerated by the shock .",
    "the production of methanol is less well understood , but it is believed that methanol is released from grain mantles , either by sputtering from a shock or by evaporation when temperatures above 100k are reached @xcite . for oh , modeling shows that a temperature around 50 - 125k and a density of 10@xmath23@xmath7 will be conducive to oh inversion @xcite .",
    "this range of values agrees with both 36  ghz and 44  ghz methanol production , but non - detections of 6  ghz and higher frequency oh maser transitions in snrs like sgraeast @xcite imply the densities and temperatures are biased towards the lower values , perhaps specifically favoring 36  ghz masers to have a closer spatial connection with 1720  mhz oh masers .",
    "the methanol and oh masers found in the sgra complex are located near each other but are not co - spatial , indicating they trace different shocks or different regions of the shock . by comparing velocities of the methanol and",
    "the oh we argue that the methanol is tracing material that has been less disturbed by the shocks , while the oh is located further in the postshock gas .",
    "the narrow , collinear distribution of 36 ghz methanol in the sgraeast interaction region with the 50 ^ -1 kms@xmath3  cloud aligns with the snr shock front , while the oh is more widely spread into the post - shock regions .",
    "44  ghz and 36  ghz methanol maser overlaps occur in the cloud / snr shock region where the conditions for maser action in both lines are fulfilled .",
    "deeper in the 50 ^ -1 kms@xmath3  cloud core , there is a group of 44  ghz methanol masers observed with no accompanying bright 36  ghz masers , indicating a hotter and denser environment than the material swept up from the shock .",
    "these masers are likely to trace star formation within the cloud core .",
    "the limited number of pointing positions in addition to a limited velocity coverage makes it hard to in detail determine the relationship between the methanol and oh masers .",
    "new data mapping a more complete region of sgra is underway , and we are aiming for a similar study with a broader velocity range when the evla upgrade is complete .",
