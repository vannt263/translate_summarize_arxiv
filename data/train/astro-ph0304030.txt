    "the residual between the cepheid distance calculation @xmath1 for a galaxy and the tully - fisher relationship ( tf ) distance calculation @xmath2 for the galaxy varies among galaxies @xcite .",
    "the residual can be small for some galaxies or greater than the sum of the errors of each calculation for other galaxies .",
    "the @xmath2 to a target galaxy is determined by relating the 21-cm line width at 20 percent of the peak value @xmath3 corrected for the inclination between our line of sight and the target galaxy s polar axis @xmath4 with the absolute magnitude @xmath5 in various wavelength bands @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 is based on the observation that pulsating cepheid stars in a galaxy have a @xmath5 related to their pulse period .",
    "cepheids obey very well defined relations and so make excellent standard candles @xcite(page 415 ) .",
    "this paper uses @xmath1 as standard distances . in this paper",
    ", the influence of neighboring galaxies on @xmath5 is investigated for the first time .",
    "a remarkably tight correlation is found relating the illumination of neighboring galaxies to ( @xmath6 ) for redshift @xmath0 . since this result",
    "was obtained with the assumption that the mass of a galaxy is constant over time , there may be a fundamental physical mechanism regulating the mass of galaxies .",
    "also , the tf assumption that the intrinsic mass to intrinsic luminosity ratio is constant among galaxies @xcite is valid for @xmath0 .",
    "the object of this paper is to examine the effect of neighboring galaxies on @xmath2 .",
    "thereby , the residual between @xmath1 and @xmath2 distances may be reduced .",
    "the approach is to ( a ) develop an equation from the principle of the conservation of energy describing the influence of neighboring galaxies on @xmath2 , ( b ) choose galaxies with published cepheid distances , and ( c ) apply the model to the target galaxies .",
    "the light emitted from a galaxy is energy from the galaxy .",
    "the principle of the conservation of energy in a galaxy requires , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the rate of change of mass @xmath9 in the target galaxy , @xmath10 is the speed of light , @xmath11 is the rate energy radiates from the target galaxy , @xmath12 is the rate of transmittal of energy from another galaxy into the target galaxy , and @xmath13 is the rate of intrinsic energy production from mass conversion processes in the target galaxy .",
    "@xcite found that the mass in the central region of a galaxy is 0.0012 of the mass of the bulge .",
    "@xcite reported that about 0.1% of a galaxy s luminous mass is at the center of galaxies and that the density of supermassive black holes ( smb ) in the universe agrees with the density inferred from observation of quasars .",
    "@xcite found similar results in their study of the relationship between the mass @xmath14 of a smb and dispersion velocity @xmath15 of a galaxy .",
    "@xcite found a tight relation between rotation velocity @xmath16 and bulge velocity dispersion @xmath17 which is strongly supporting a relationship of the center force with total gravitational mass of a galaxy .",
    "either the dynamics of many galaxies are producing the same increase of mass in the center at the same rate or a mechanism exists to evaporate ( convert to radiated energy ) the mass increase that changes as the rate of inflow changes .",
    "the rotation curves imply the dynamics of galaxies differ such that the former is unlikely .",
    "@xcite suggested a feedback mechanism must exist in such a way that @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 is assumed to remain constant , the matter in an incremental cylinder shell of a galaxy is constant , and @xmath20 .",
    "whatever the source of matter in a galaxy , the energy content of the inflowing matter equals @xmath13 .",
    "constant mass in a galaxy and the observation of @xmath13 implies there is inflowing matter .",
    "another source of energy for a galaxy is from other galaxies as @xmath12 .",
    "the energy transfer from other galaxies can be ( a ) in the form of photons @xmath21 , ( b ) in the form of potential energy @xmath22 from gravitational forces of other galaxies .",
    "the @xmath21 component is dependant on the surface area cross section of the target galaxy presented to the other galaxy , the distance between galaxies , and the @xmath5 of the other galaxies .",
    "the @xmath22 is a conservative field .",
    "if the matter in an incremental cylinder shell of the target galaxy is constant , then @xmath23 . the heat change caused by the movement of a galaxy as a whole in a potential field",
    "is assumed to be negligible in the b band .",
    "therefore , conservation of energy implies the only radiated energy observed is from re - radiated energy from neighboring galaxies and from @xmath13 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are proportionality constants of @xmath21 and @xmath13 , respectively [ herein called `` conversion efficiencies '' ( ce ) ] and @xmath27 .",
    "the ce s represent the fraction of energy transmitted in the measurement band of @xmath5 relative to the available energy .",
    "hence , @xmath28 is the observed luminosity originally from neighbor galaxies re - emitted from a target galaxy and @xmath29 is the observed intrinsic luminosity of the target galaxy .",
    "since @xmath13 will vary among galaxies , @xmath29 will also vary among galaxies .",
    "the @xmath25 is a function of the target galaxy s absorption per unit surface area and the re - emitted light per unit absorption . since the hi mass to total mass ratio increases systematically from giant galaxies towards dwarf galaxies @xcite",
    ", @xmath25 may change accordingly .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the @xmath25 also changes with @xmath13 .    consider the ( @xmath30 ) as an error in @xmath2 .",
    "the error rate is defined as the correction factor @xmath31 , @xmath32 or , @xmath33    consider the attenuation of energy is a constant factor @xmath34 of the light from the target galaxy .",
    "the term on the left side of equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) is the luminosity calculated by the tf relation .",
    "if @xmath1 is the true distance , the last term on the right side of equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) is the intrinsic luminosity that would be calculated using @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . substituting these relations into equation  (",
    "[ eq:6])and solving equations  ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) for @xmath31 yields , @xmath37    a binomial expansion of the denominator of equation  ( [ eq:8 ] ) yields , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the sum of second and higher order terms and is approximately a constant and , @xmath40    if @xmath41 among galaxies , then a plot of @xmath31 versus @xmath21 will yield a linear relationship .",
    "that is , for each @xmath21 there corresponds one and only one value of @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , @xmath31 is a functional relationship of @xmath21 .",
    "the function may have discontinuities and gaps but it is still one relationship .",
    "galaxies with a measured @xmath1 can be used as calibration galaxies to calculate @xmath42 and @xmath39",
    ". then equations ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) can be used to calculate a distance corresponding to a @xmath1 .",
    "the criteria for choosing galaxies for the analysis are ( 1 ) the galaxy has a published cepheid distance , ( 2 ) the distance to the galaxy must be large enough that the milky way s contribution to @xmath21 is negligible , ( 3 ) the distance to the galaxy must be large enough that the contribution of the peculiar velocity to the redshift @xmath43 measurement is relatively small , and ( 4 ) either a published total apparent magnitude in the in the b band @xmath44 or a published total apparent corrected i - band magnitude @xmath45 must be available for both the target and close galaxies .    the data and references for the 31 target galaxies is presented in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the morphology type data was obtained from the ned database .",
    "the de vaucouleurs radius @xmath46 , the @xmath44 ( `` btc '' in the leda database ) , the @xmath45 ( `` itc '' in the leda database ) , and @xmath3 data came from the leda database .",

    "a distance greater than 19 mpc , compared to the measured @xmath1 of 14.1 mpc , or a high mass / luminosity ratio is needed for mond .",
    "the @xmath2 value of 25.5 mpc given herein is compatible with mond .",
    "ngc 3031 has significant non - circular motion in its hi gas @xcite .",
    "ngc 3198 is well suited for testing theories since the data for it has the largest radius and number of surface brightness scale lengths @xcite .",
    "ngc 4321 has a very asymmetric hi rotation curve and is `` lopsided''@xcite in the disk region of the galaxy .",
    "the ned database was used to assemble a list of galaxies closest to each of the target galaxies .",

    "the angular coordinates were taken from the ned database . for each target galaxy , the distance from each target galaxy to each of the other galaxies was calculated . the neighbor galaxies with the smallest distance",
    "were chosen as the close galaxies .",

    "the use of @xmath49 herein is restricted to only the selection of the neighbor galaxies .",

    "the sign of @xmath70 was of minimal significance for these galaxies .",
    "( c ) since the relative position of these 17 galaxies on the @xmath31 versus @xmath21 plot changed little , these 17 target galaxies established the initial @xmath21 ranges and the initial constants of equation  ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "( d ) the sign of @xmath70 of the remaining target galaxies was determined such that their value of @xmath21 was within their error limits of one of the initial lines .",

    "a plot of @xmath31 versus @xmath21 is shown in figures  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the galaxies form into four distinct conversion efficiency type ( cet ) relations , labeled cet 1 , cet 2 , cet 3 , and cet 4 .",
    "the characteristics of each cet is tabulated in table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "the statistical test of variance of the line and @xmath21 of the sample galaxies ( f test ) for all cet regions is 0.99 .",
    "the projections of the lines intersect at ( @xmath21 , @xmath31 ) = ( 550@xmath7650 @xmath77,-0.54@xmath76.07 ) .",
    "the error @xmath78 in @xmath21 due solely to the error in @xmath1 is also listed in table  [ tab:1 ] for each target galaxy .",
    "table  [ tab:2 ] shows the range of @xmath21 and @xmath78 for each cet .",
    "the choice of sign of @xmath70 could also have been done using the criteria that values of @xmath21 and @xmath78 be within the ranges specified in table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "the large error in ngc 4603 is a result of the unusually large published error in @xmath1 .",
    "ngc 4535 was the only galaxy where the line was outside its error limits .",
    "ngc 4535 could fit nearly as well in cet 4 with a positive @xmath70 sign and an out of range @xmath78 .",
    "if the sign of @xmath70 of ngc 4535 is positive , ngc 4535 is closer to cet 4 , the correlation coefficient of cet 3 increases to 0.94 , and the @xmath78 is in the cet 3 range .",
    "therefore , if cet 4 is selected for ngc 4535 , the @xmath78 and the @xmath21 are in different ranges .",
    "hence , ngc 4535 was considered to be in cet 3 .",
    "the analysis presented herein depends on the cepheid distances being secure , standard distances .",
    "@xcite adopted a metallicity pl correction factor of @xmath79 .",
    "@xcite assumed the pl relation was independent of metallicity . if the cepheid distances used are from the earlier work of @xcite , which are higher than @xcite , the correlation coefficients are  -0.74 , 0.89 , 0.85 , and 0.98 for the cet 1 , cet 2 , cet 3 , and cet 4 zones , respectively , and the slopes and intercepts of the new equations are within 3 @xmath15 of the slopes and intercepts of the equations of table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "thus , the theory and the result presented herein appear robust relative to systematic variation in the cepheid distances .",
    "the analysis also depends on the hubble law .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty in the value of @xmath49 .",
    "the attempt to minimize this uncertainty was to consider only galaxies near the target galaxy and to calculate the distances between galaxies using the ratio of @xmath43 values .",
    "this assumes that the @xmath49 varies little around each target galaxy .",
    "the effect of the error in @xmath49 is limited to a selection bias . using @xmath80",
    "produced no significant change in the results .",
    "ngc 3621 , ngc 3319 , and ngc 4535 are outliers in cet 1 , cet 2 , and cet 3 , respectively .",
    "these three galaxies have a more negative @xmath31 than their respective theoretical lines . the removal of these galaxies from consideration yields the modified correlation coefficient , modified @xmath42 , and modified @xmath39 listed in table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "@xcite suggested the cepheid distances may be underestimated due to metallicity and magnitude incompleteness .",
    "also , the sign and value of a possible metallicity correction factor is uncertain @xcite . as the difference between @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the effect will be to change only the slope and intercept of the cet equations .",
    "the existence of four @xmath21 zones is unexplained .",
    "it should be noted that for each zone @xmath42 and @xmath39 are constants distinct from other zones .",
    "we speculate that since @xmath42 has discrete values , equation ( [ eq:9a ] ) implies @xmath25 , @xmath81 , or both must have discrete values , also .",
    "that is , the values are not continuously variable . if @xmath25 and @xmath81 depend on internal characteristics of a galaxy such as chemical composition , then the gap between cet zones and a discrete value @xmath42 implies @xmath21 must influence at least two of @xmath25 , @xmath82 , or @xmath13 .",
    "we speculate that other galaxies influence parameters internal to a galaxy including chemical composition .",
    "another unexplained characteristic is the ratio of the slopes .",
    "the ratio of the slopes is 4.24 between cet 3 and cet 2 and 3.65 between cet 4 and cet 3 ( both approximately 4 ) . also unexplained",
    "is the convergence of the linear equations to ( @xmath21 , @xmath31 ) = ( 550@xmath7650 @xmath77,-0.54@xmath76.07 ) .    since the @xmath83 relationship has excellent correlation coefficients without ngc 3621 , ngc 3319 , and ngc 4535 , some of the assumptions made in developing the model may be invalid for these galaxies .",
    "ngc 3319 is rich in hi @xcite and ngc 4535 is poor in hi @xcite . however , if a galaxy has different absorption due to hi , then the @xmath81 should also change since hi is a fuel for emission , also .",
    "another intriguing possibility is that there are three more cet zones .",
    "the additional zones would consist of ( a ) ngc 2090 and ngc 3031 , ( b ) ngc 1326a and ngc 3319 , and ( c ) ngc 1365 and ngc 4535 .",
    "the functional relationship would be maintained .",
    "another method to determine the orientation ( sign ) of each galaxy , more data , and reduced error are needed .",
    "the choice of sign of the inclination angle is the most subjective part of the data . in some cases such as ngc 0300",
    ", the difference in @xmath21 causes a change of cet zone which leaves the @xmath31 nearly the same .",
    "as expected , a sign change has greater effect on the galaxies with one very close neighbor .",
    "if all galaxies have their inclination sign reversed , four cet categories are again formed with correlation coefficients of -0.72 , 0.98 , 0.91 , and 0.93 . however , several galaxies are outside their error limits of a line .",
    "the method is robust .",
    "the choice of sign reported herein allows this method to work . however , a better method in determining the sign would place greater confidence in the numbers .",
    "ngc 2841 is close to the calculated line in cet 2 with a measured @xmath84 and a calculated @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the model in this paper accounts for nearly all the error in ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath1 is much less than mond requires .",
    "this suggests ngc 2841 is a problem for mond .",
    "when a galaxy s fundamental plane parameter is compared to the galaxy s luminosity , a broader scatter and outliers ( see , for example , @xcite ) result than if a parameter other than luminosity is compared .",
    "this paper suggests this is due to the effect of neighboring galaxies .",
    "relative to the tf equations , the model must still discover the relationship of @xmath3 to the @xmath31 .",
    "we speculate that after the adjustment for neighboring galaxies , this correction may explain the scale error found by @xcite between raw cepheid and tf distances .",
    "the tf assumption that the intrinsic mass to intrinsic luminosity ratio is constant among galaxies @xcite is valid for @xmath0 .",
    "the tf approach can be an even more powerful tool with @xmath31 considered .",
    "@xmath86  the sample considered 31 spiral galaxies with published cepheid distances . predicted linear relationships between a factor expressing the relation between tf and cepheid distance calculations and a factor expressing the amount of impinging energy from nearby galaxies were found .",

    "<S> the energy impinging on a target galaxy from neighboring galaxies is related to the residual between tully - fisher and cepheid distance calculations of the target galaxy . </S>",

    "<S> this relationship is of interest not only for its ability to reduce the tully - fisher to cepheid distance residual but also because it suggests neighboring galaxies have a strong influence on the apparent luminosity of galaxies and it suggests the tully - fisher relationship assumption that the intrinsic mass to intrinsic luminosity ratio is constant among galaxies is valid for @xmath0 . </S>"
