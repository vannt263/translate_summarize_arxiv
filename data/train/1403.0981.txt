    "however , we have used a small fixed number of block states , i.e. , fixed bond dimension , in order to demonstrate the benefits underlying the ttns geometry . the four lowest lying eigenstates ( @xmath150 )",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pes_dmrg ] calculated by the qc - dmrg method using @xmath151 block states or alternatively by the ttns approach with @xmath138 and @xmath152 .",
    "we have confirmed that each state is a singlet with @xmath153 .",
    "states as a function of bond length using the tree - tns with @xmath47 and @xmath154 with @xmath152 . for @xmath47 , the one - dimensional mps - ansatz used in dmrg is recovered . ]",
    "the relative error of the ground state ( @xmath105 ) and the third excited state ( @xmath155 ) , @xmath156 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pes_error_ttns ] .",
    "the open symbols stand for the mps solution while the filled symbols indicate the ttns result .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the accuracy of the energy dropped for both states by at least an order of magnitude . for the ground state close to the equilibrium bond length",
    "the change is almost two orders of magnitude .",
    "it is important to emphasize again that all parameters of the calculations were kept fixed except that we used the optimized one - dimensional mps - like topologies or the two - dimensional optimized ttns - like topologies .",
    "the network topologies for both cases were optimized for each bond length using the procedure outlined in sec .",
    "ii .    in the mps based dmrg method",
    "the matrices of the one - dimensional tensor network are optimized iteratively by traversing through the network starting from the left boundary until the right boundary is reached . in the following steps the same procedure",
    "is repeated but in the reverse direction .",
    "this systematic optimization procedure is called as sweeping .",
    "the relative error of the two @xmath0 states as a function of iteration steps is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : relerror_iter_mps ] for the mps case with @xmath138 and @xmath152 .     and @xmath152 for a few selected bond lengths .",
    "]    it can be seen in the figure that the relative error of the ground state energy drops quickly as a function of iteration steps and it saturates after some 20 iterations .",
    "in contrast to this , the convergence of the third excited state is somewhat slower .",
    "in addition , the method lost the target state for certain interaction steps , i.e. , for certain network configurations .",
    "this is due to the very low bond dimension used in the test calculations . when we used larger bond dimension or included point group symmetries this problem was fully eliminated .",
    "in case of the tree - network , there is more freedom to choose the optimal sweeping procedure , i.e. , to choose the optimal path through which the network is traversed . in the present work",
    ", we have swept through the network by going recursively back and forth through each branch .",
    "therefore , according to the labeling of the orbitals on the lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ttns_sweeping ] one sweep goes through the orbitals as 1 2 3 4 5 4 6 4 3 7 8 7 3 2 9 10 9 11 9 2 1 12 13 14 13 15 13 12 16 17 16 18 16 12 1 19 20 21 20 22 20 19 23 24 23 25 23 19 .",
    "the main advantage of this path is that highly entangled orbitals located close to the center of the network are optimized several times in a full sweep .",
    "the relative error of the two @xmath0 states as a function of iteration steps obtained by the ttns method with @xmath137 and @xmath152 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : relerror_iter_ttns ] .",
    "but for the ttns method with @xmath154 .",
    "]    it can be seen that the relative error of the ground state energy reached the saturation value of the mps calculation ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : relerror_iter_mps ] ) after a few iteration steps .",
    "however , unlike to the mps result the error dropped further for subsequent iteration steps until a much lower saturation value was reached .",
    "the overall improvement compared to the mps case was almost two orders of magnitudes .",
    "similar improvement was observed for the excited state , although , due to the low bond dimension the target state was lost again for certain interaction steps , i.e. , for certain network configurations .",
    "since the one- and two - orbital entropy functions were calculated to optimize network topologies they can also be used to locate the avoided crossing . for problems in condensed matter physics the one- and two - orbital entropy functions and the block entropy",
    "are used to locate quantum phase transitions @xcite . for translationally invariant systems",
    "the single - orbital entropy function is the same for all sites while in a chemical system it is orbital dependent .",
    "therefore , the behavior of @xmath144 as a function of bond length can be used to detect and locate transition points where the wavefunction changes dramatically . in fig .",
    "[ fig : i_tot ] @xmath144 is shown as a function of bond length .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath144 has a cusp like structure at @xmath157 indicating the position of the avoided crossing .",
    "the present paper has been devoted to the application of the quantum - chemistry tree tensor network state ( qc - ttns ) method to calculate the potential energy curve in the vicinity of the ionic - covalent avoided crossing in lif .",
    "we have discussed the main features of the most general version of the qc - ttns algorithm in which the local properties of the tensors can be different for each orbital .",
    "the optimized tensor topologies , which reflect the structure of the entanglement bonds between the molecular orbitals , were determined by minimizing the entanglement length in the system as the bond length between the li and f was stretched . in order to compare tensor topology effects only , we have kept all parameters of the algorithms fixed and used a very small bond dimension or alternatively a very small number of block states . by comparing the mps(dmrg ) and ttns convergence properties",
    "we have demonstrated that the ttns approach can converge to a significantly lower energy .",
    "although the tensor contraction scales as @xmath122 the ttns topology offers a more optimal network structure since the relative error of the energy of the ground state as well as the excited states can be improved by an order of magnitude or more for the same value of @xmath28 .",
    "this also indicates that the mps result can be reproduced with a significantly lower bond dimension using the ttns method .",
    "our qc - ttns approach seems to be a promising direction reflected by the stability and fast convergence of the new method even for systems in which the wavefunction character changes as a function of bond length , especially in the region of an avoided crossing .",
    "in contrast to the mps case , however , the optimization of the network is a more complex task .",
    "extension of this work using more complex systems and orbital dependent coordination number is under progress .",
