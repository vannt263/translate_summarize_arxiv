    "@xmath4 transition metal ( tm ) compounds are expected to obey mott physics : the relatively compact @xmath1-shells are associated with a @xmath5 ( bandwidth ) , thus many tm oxides , halides , sulphides , etc are strongly correlated @xmath1-metals , or mott insulators with localized @xmath1-electrons , or show transition between such states at accessible temperatures ( @xmath6 ) and pressures ( @xmath7 ) @xcite . just in the borderline cases , the emerging low-@xmath6 order ( if any ) shows great variability : while in the large-@xmath8 limit , we find usually long - range order with a strictly local ( single-@xmath1-shell ) order parameter ( op ) , at @xmath5 the relevant spatial unit often extends over two lattice sites ( dimer ) , or even four ( tetramer , or plaquette , depending on the lattice geometry ) .",
    "stoichiometric good - quality bavs@xmath0 is a moderately correlated @xmath4 sulphide with a metal  insulator transition and a variety of ordered phases ( for recent reviews , see @xcite and @xcite ) . the driving force of the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , and the nature of the order parameters ( op ) of the low-@xmath6 phases is incompletely understood .",
    "our aim is to describe and discuss a number of recent experimental findings and use the results to set up a minimum electronic model of pure bavs@xmath0 . with a suitable change of parameters",
    ", the same model should serve for the generalized bavs@xmath0 system which includes , along with ideal bavs@xmath0 , also sulphur - deficient @xcite , sr - doped , and nb - doped bavs@xmath0 , along with the selenide bavse@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the structure of bavs@xmath0 is quasi - one - dimensional : it can be envisaged as a triangular lattice of chains of face - sharing sulphur octahedra .",
    "the chains are oriented along the crystallographic @xmath9-axis which is a @xmath10 axis in the high-@xmath6 hexagonal phase .",
    "v ions sit at the octahedral centres . within a chain ,",
    "v  v distances are short ( 2.81@xmath11 ) , while the inter - chain separation is large ( 6.73@xmath11 ) .",
    "it had been thought that bavs@xmath0 is a quasi - one - dimensional conductor , with a large conductivity anisotropy ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , the first single crystal measurements showed that bavs@xmath0 is an almost isotropic conductor with @xmath13 in a wide range of temperature @xcite .",
    "now we understand that quasi - one - dimensionality is important in bavs@xmath0 but in a more subtle sense : it leads to the coexistence of two kinds of @xmath1-electrons .    at ambient pressure ,",
    "good - quality specimens of stoichioetric bavs@xmath0 undergo three subsequent second order transitions : a structural ( hexagonal - to - orthorombic ) transition at @xmath14k , a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) at @xmath15k , and a magnetic ordering transition at @xmath16k .",
    "the fact that the mit remains a second order transition in an extended range of pressure @xcite shows that the mit is a symmetry - breaking transition .",
    "the nature of symmetry breaking is the lowering of translational symmetry : the unit cell is doubled along the @xmath9-axis from the high-@xmath6 two - atomic unit cell to four - atomic unit cell ( which may be called tetramers ) @xcite .",
    "the succession of three phase transitions means three successive lowerings of the high - temperature symmetry @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the space group and @xmath19 stands for time reversal .",
    "point group symmetry ( a @xmath10 rotation ) is broken at @xmath20 , translational symmetry is lowered at @xmath21 and finally time reversal symmetry is broken at @xmath22 ( and at the same time , translational symmetry is further lowered by the creation of a long - period magnetic structure in the @xmath23 plane @xcite as well as in the @xmath9-direction @xcite ) .",
    "though the crystal lattice changes in at least two of the three transitions , we may aspire to model all three in terms of a purely electronic model .",
    "the @xmath14k transition can be described as the appearance of orbital polarization in the metallic phase , and the mit as spin - orbital tetramerization .",
    "it is , however , not easy to contrive a lattice fermion model which allows the prediction of the phase diagram of bavs@xmath0 .",
    "bavse@xmath0 is isostructural and isoelectronic with bavs@xmath0 so we may expect that its phase diagram is similar to that of bavs@xmath0 but this is not the case . the structural transition at 300k",
    "is followed by ferromagnetic ordering at the curie temperature @xmath24k @xcite .",
    "the system remains metallic at all temperatures .    since the basic ingredients of an electronic model of bavse@xmath0 should be the same as for bavs@xmath0",
    ", we should require that with tuning the model parameters , the phase diagram of either bavs@xmath0 or bavse@xmath0 can be reproduced .",
    "it transpires that the tetramerization and mit of bavs@xmath0 require a fine - tuning which is not a generic property of the underlying fermion model .",
    "we surmise that in the same sense , a de - tuning of parameters takes place under pressure : the mit of bavs@xmath0 is suppressed for @xmath25gpa @xcite , leaving behind a metal with mysterious magnetic properties @xcite .    in the spirit of the unified treatment of the classic mott system v@xmath26cr@xmath27o@xmath0 @xcite ,",

    "part of the current encircles the core : it corresponds to net angular momentum .",
    "in fact @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the component of the angular momentum along the chain direction .",
    "let us , however , note the presence of eddy currents in fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] .",
    "such eddies are familiar from octupolar states @xcite , and here the illustrate the statement that magnetic dipoles and octupoles are mixed under trigonal symmetry .    to summarize , thinking of purely local ( on - site ) orbital order , @xmath3 electrons may support either quadrupolar ( real orbital ) order , or complex orbital order @xcite which is a mixture of ising - like dipolar order with octupolar order .",
    "the @xmath2 electrons have no local orbital degree of freedom .",
    "in addition , both @xmath3 and @xmath2 electrons have spins which may order either independently of , or simultaneously with the orbital degrees of freedom . though there may be transitions which are predominantly orbital , and others which are predominantly spin - ordering phenomena , on general grounds we should expect that spin and orbital order mutually induce each other , subject to symmetry restrictions @xcite .",
    "the relativistic spin  orbit coupling is not negligible for v ions .",
    "the anisotropy of the spin susceptibility @xmath43 is in the range @xmath44% , and shows sharp anomalies at the mit , and the magnetic ordering transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : susc ] , bottom ) .",
    "in addition to on - site order parameters , there are local order parameters involving a pair of sites ( e.g. those characterizing the internal structure of the crystallographic unit cell which contains two v atoms ) , or four consecutive sites along a chain ( this is important for the tetramerized insulating phase in the temperature range @xmath45 ) . for the metallic orthorombic phase at @xmath46 an itinerant order parameter like the orbital polarization of the @xmath3 subband is more adequate .",
    "the number of possible ordering schemes is considerable , and different members of the family of bavs@xmath0/bavse@xmath0-based materials belong to different realizations of the phase diagram .",
    "in principle , the formal @xmath1-electron count v@xmath47 could be satisfied with @xmath2 electrons alone ( @xmath48 where @xmath49 is number / v - atom ) , or @xmath3-electrons alone @xmath50 , or any ratio @xmath51 requiring that @xmath52 .",
    "however , it can be argued that , on the one hand , @xmath3 electrons must be present in bavs@xmath0 and , on the other hand , @xmath3-electrons alone could not account for the observed behavior .",
    "the hexagonal - to - orthorombic transition at @xmath53k makes energetic sense only if it serves to lift the degeneracy of the @xmath3 states .",
    "the large curie - like susceptibility at @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : susc ] , top ) can be interpreted as the spin susceptibility of localized @xmath3-electrons if their density is about @xmath55 . on the other hand , @xmath3-electrons only could not account for the conductivity of the hexagonal metallic phase , so the fermi level must lie within the @xmath2 band .",
    "lda calculations arrive at the estimate @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding concentration @xmath57 of localized electrons could not be reconciled with the observed susceptibility .",
    "the difficulty is resolved by dmft calculations which show that intra- and inter - site correlation effects cause a redistribution of electrons over the subbands so that in the low-@xmath6 phases @xmath58 is realized .",
    "such a magic value of the @xmath51 ratio allows the arising of short - period ordered states , e.g. , tetramerized states where the four - atom unit cell may be either @xmath59 ( as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or @xmath60 ( which we discuss as an alternative ) . in any case",
    ", the magic value @xmath61 seems to be a precondition for opening a gap in the continuous mit . in other words",
    ", correlation acts to create an electronic structure in which a low-@xmath6 insulating phase is possible . in this sense",
    "we may consider bavs@xmath0 strongly correlated though it does not have an insulating phase without some kind of symmetry breaking .",

    "the intensity scales from black to white .",
    "circles show the positions of peaks in corresponding energy distribution curves ( photoelectron intensity vs. binding energy ) .",
    "the white circles follow predominantly s(3p ) bands and the black ones v(3d ) bands .",
    "( right below ) .",
    "second derivative of a detail of the map on the left , and in the proximity of the fermi level .",
    "the image shows both v(3d ) bands : the weakly dispersive @xmath3 bands , and the dispersive @xmath2 band that is hybridized with a s(@xmath64 ) band .",
    "( right above ) the momentum distribution curve ( photoelectron intensity vs. wave vector ) taken at the fermi energy with 50 mev integration shows the crossings of the @xmath2 band at around 3/4 of @xmath62-z .",
    "no crossing is easily detectable for the @xmath3 part .",
    "( after@xcite ) .",
    "]    it is important to have direct experimental information about the relative position of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands .",
    "an angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiment was carried out @xcite which reveals the nature of the band structure for @xmath65 .",
    "representative results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arpes ] .",
    "the essential result is that the fermi level is pinned in an energy range with high density of state where a dispersive @xmath1-band ( the @xmath2 band ) crosses a set of levels whose dispersion could not be directly measured but we may estimate that the associated band - width is at most 0.3ev .",
    "this fits our idea of @xmath3-like states : dmft gives very narrow effective bands @xcite while ir optics shows that @xmath3-states are essentially localized @xcite .",
    "the arpes experiment gave information about the @xmath65 dispersion only , so we could not directly measure @xmath51 which requires a brillouin zone average .",
    "nevertheless , we can assert that neither @xmath66 nor @xmath67 is small and that @xmath61 is at least compatible with the experiment .",
    "the finding that essentially the same number of wide - band and narrow - band @xmath1-electrons coexist at energies near the fermi level , allows to speculate about the nature of the relevant fermion models of bavs@xmath0 ( meaning both pure bavs@xmath0 and the related systems ) .",
    "it has to be a two - band model , a kind of a @xmath1-band anderson lattice , with the @xmath2-states playing the role of the wide band , and the @xmath3-like states the role of the strongly correlated narrow band .",
    "the next question is that whether the @xmath3-level should be considered orbitally degenerate . strictly speaking",
    ", the orthorombic distortion setting in at @xmath53k lifts the degeneracy of the real @xmath3-states @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and one may be tempted to omit one of the @xmath3-orbitals .",
    "however , this would prohibit the creation of the orbital - momentum - carrying complex states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] ) , and thus would leave us without explanation of the susceptibility anisotropy ( fig ,  [ fig : susc ] ) which we ascribe to the spin - orbit coupling . therefore we suggest that the effective hamiltonian should include the orbital degeneracy of the @xmath3-electrons and explain the orbital polarization as an interaction effect .",
    "schematically , the effective hamiltonian ( written , for the sake of simplicity , in one - dimensional form ) , is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the periodic anderson model ( pam ) part discussed above , @xmath70 is the hund coupling , and @xmath71 contains additional interactions .",
    "the pam part is @xmath72 where @xmath73 creates an @xmath2 electron at site @xmath74 with spin @xmath75 , @xmath76 the same for an @xmath3 electron with orbital index @xmath77 , the @xmath49 s are corresponding occupation numbers , and in the hubbard term @xmath78 incorporates both @xmath2 and @xmath3 electrons .",
    "we neglected @xmath3-hopping .",
    "we expect that double occupation by @xmath3-electrons is suppressed and the hund coupling counts only if an @xmath3-electron and an @xmath79-electron share a site : @xmath80 .",
    "double exchange may well explain the itinerant ferromagnetism of bavse@xmath0 @xcite and bavs@xmath81 @xcite .",
    "it may play a delicate role by inducing ferromagnetic correlations in an overall non - ferromagnetic state in pure bavs@xmath0 .",
    "we envisage that locking in to the magic ratio @xmath61 ( @xmath52 being fixed ) emerges in only certain phases of @xmath82 . in any case , it has to be an intersite interaction effect . in the strong coupling limit",
    "@xmath83 generates a hierarchy of effective interactions , including multi - site interactions .",
    "these should be combined with intersite coulomb processes which we collect in @xmath71 .",
    "in particular we expect that an effective interaction for nearest neighbour @xmath84 pairs appears , with the general structure that the orbital interaction ( @xmath85 or @xmath86 , resp . )",
    "is different in the spin - singlet ( @xmath87 ) and spin - triplet ( @xmath88 ) sectors @xmath89 if @xmath90 is stronger than @xmath91 , the system will contain a number of @xmath84 singlet pairs .",
    "this may explain why a spin gap opens at the mit @xcite .",
    "the density of @xmath84 pairs and their spatial distribution will be decided by effective multi - site interactions which in turn reflect the polarizability of the @xmath2 band at the particular filling .",
    "all in all , promotion of electrons from the @xmath2 band to localized @xmath3 levels is favored by two sources of energy gain : @xmath92 singlet binding , and the opening of a gap in the band .",
    "it is clear from the susceptibility curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : susc ] ) that as @xmath16k is approached from above , a substantial number of @xmath3-spins is not in single pairs yet .",
    "these residual spins order magnetically , assuming a thee - dimensional long - period structure but we may suspect that this complicated structure is picked by weak residual interactions and it is the least robust feature of bavs@xmath0 .",
    "the properties of stochiometric bavs@xmath0 are sensitive to pressure . the mit is gradually suppressed until it vanishes at the critical pressure @xmath93gpa @xcite ( see also the @xmath94 curve in the inset of fig .  [",

    "it need not be the same magnetic order as observed at ambient pressures ; in fact , since the low-@xmath7 magnetic phase grew out of a pre - existing tetramerized background which is not present at @xmath101 , we have reason to expect that the two magnetic orders are different . to emphasize this",
    ", we denoted the high-@xmath7 magnetic transition temperature with @xmath99 .",
    "in what follows , we present magnetoresistivity data which prove that @xmath95 gets near @xmath96 ( so at least excluding option i ) ) .",
    "there is an additional finding indicating that in fact option iii ) belongs to the true situation , i.e. , there is an ordered phase at @xmath102 in a pressure interval above the critical pressure .",
    "finally , we describe sr - doped bavs@xmath0 which can be viewed as bavs@xmath0 under chemical pressure .      in the high - pressure experiments described in ref .",
    "@xcite we found that at carefully chosen pressures @xmath21 can become as low as 7 - 10k . with @xmath103 of the same order as zeeman splittings in laboratory fields , it is reasonable to ask whether the mit can be induced by magnetic field .",
    "such is indeed the case .",
    "[ fig : fieldinduced2 ] shows an example when in the absence of field , the sample is insulating , and increasing the magnetic field changes the character of the @xmath6-dependence from non - monotonic ( insulating at low @xmath6 ) to monotically decreasing , i.e. , metallic at all @xmath6 .",
    "suppression of the insulating phase by field is plausible if the insulator has antiferromagnetic correlations .",
