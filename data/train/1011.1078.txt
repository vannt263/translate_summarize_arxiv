    "ultracold quantum gases have presented a new class of systems to investigate many - particle quantum phenomena  @xcite .",
    "since ultracold gas samples are very dilute at particle densities around @xmath2 or @xmath3/@xmath4 , we need extremely low nanokelvin temperatures to reach quantum degenerate regime .",
    "evaporative cooling has been the powerful and exclusive method for producing quantum gas samples such as bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite .",
    "rapid and efficient evaporation requires fast rethermalization and conservative environment minimizing undesired atom loss and heating due to , e.g. , inelastic collisions and background collisions  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we describe a fast evaporation to produce a large condensate in an optically plugged magnetic quadrupole trap .",
    "a quadrupole trap provides a large trap volume and tight confinement due to the linearity of the potential , which make it beneficial to efficient evaporation .",
    "also the quadruple field cab be generated from a simple pair of coaxial coils with opposite currents , allowing large optical access to a sample . however , majorana spin - flip loss is a significant drawback in the quadrupole trap .",
    "near the zero - field point at the trap center , nonadiabatic spin transitions to an untrappable state cause atom loss and resultant heating , eventually limiting the maximum gain in phase - space density  @xcite .",
    "several techniques have been implemented to avoid this detrimental effect , including applying a time - orbiting bias field  @xcite or an repulsive optical plug potential  @xcite , or transferring to an optical dipole trap  @xcite .",
    "the optical plugging scheme preserves the linearity of the trapping potential , so it is advantageous for fast evaporation .",
    "the first @xmath0na bec of @xmath5  atoms was produced in 7  s evaporation  @xcite .",
    "recently , high efficiency of evaporation cooling in a plugged trap has been demonstrated by producing a large condensate of @xmath6  atoms in 40  s evaporation  @xcite .",
    "here we report a rapid production of a large condensate with @xmath7  atoms in 14  s evaporation .",
    "the distinct feature of our system is that the plug beam is offsetted from the magnetic zero - field point .",
    "this seems contradicting to the role of the plug , but we find that a slight misalignment less than a beam waist is favorable for bec production because it forms a single global minimum in the combined magnetic and optical potential .",
    "the pointing stability of the plug beam was improved by using a fiber , which makes the fine adjustment of the plug position possible .",
    "furthermore , we have investigated the effects of the majorana loss and the plug by measuring the loss rates and the resultant heating rates for various conditions .",
    "the average loss energy of a spin - flipped atom shows an almost linear dependence on temperature and is determined to be about 60% of the average energy of a trapped atom . for a plugged trap , the reduction factor in the loss rate",
    "is found to be exponentially proportional to a boltzmann factor .",
    "this confirms that the plugging effect results from density suppression due to the repulsive optical potential in the loss region . finally",

    ". slowed atoms were collected for 3  s in a dark magneto - optical trap ( mot )  @xcite and the atoms in the hyperfine state @xmath9 were transferred in a magnetic quadrupole trap , where @xmath10 is the total angular momentum and @xmath11 is the magnetic quantum number .",

    "the atom transferring was simply done by ramping @xmath14 at a rate of about 10  g / cm / ms and simultaneously turning off the mot laser beams .",
    "the initial number and temperature of the atoms in the magnetic trap were @xmath15 atoms and @xmath16k , respectively .",
    "optical plugging was performed by focusing a blue - detuned , 532  nm laser beam near the zero of the magnetic field .",
    "the plug beam propagated along the @xmath12-direction with a beam waist of @xmath17 m , providing a repulsive potential barrier of @xmath18k with 1.7  w , where @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant . in order to improve its pointing stability",
    ", we used a fiber to deliver the plug laser beam close to the main chamber , which was critically important for our bec production  @xcite . for several weeks of operation",
    ", the plug position needed little or no adjustment .",
    "finally , rf evaporative cooling was applied for 14  s to the atoms in the plugged quadrupole trap .",
    "when a circular plug beam is placed at the center of the quadrupole field , the combined potential has azimuthal symmetry , forming a ring trap [ fig.[fig : plug](a ) ] .",
    "this ring geometry is interesting in terms of persistent current and vortex generation  @xcite .",
    "however , it is desirable to break this symmetry and generate a single point minimum in the trapping potential for controlled production of condensates .",
    "furthermore , the critical temperature in a ring trap for a given atom number is typically low because of no confinement along the azimuthal direction . in previous experiments ,",
    "this ring symmetry was broken by applying a plug beam in the transverse direction  @xcite or using an elliptical beam  @xcite . in our experiment , we simply displaced the plug beam from the zero of the magnetic field by @xmath20 m [ fig .",
