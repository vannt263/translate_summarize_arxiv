    "the standard model of electroweak interactions has by now been impressively tested to one part in a thousand level thanks to the formidable experimental work carried out at lep and slc . however ,",
    "when it comes to the symmetry breaking mechanism clouds remain in this otherwise bright horizon .    in the minimal version of the standard model of electroweak interactions the same mechanism ( a one - doublet complex scalar field )",
    "gives masses simultaneously to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge bosons and to the fermionic matter fields ( other than the neutrino ) .",
    "in the simplest minimal standard model there is an upper bound on @xmath3 dictated by triviality considerations , which hint at the fact that at a scale @xmath4 tev new interactions should appear if the higgs particle is not found by then@xcite . on the other hand , in the minimal standard model",
    "it is completely unnatural to have a light higgs particle since its mass is not protected by any symmetry .",
    "this contradiction is solved by supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , where essentially the same symmetry breaking mechanism is at work , although the scalar sector becomes much richer in this case .",
    "relatively light scalars are preferred .",
    "in fact , if supersymmetry is to remain a useful idea in phenomenology , it is crucial that the higgs particle is found with a mass @xmath5 gev , or else the theoretical problems , for which supersymmetry was invoked in the first place , will reappear@xcite .",
    "a very recent two - loop calculation@xcite raises this limit somewhat , to about 130 gev .",
    "a third possibility is the one provided by models of dynamical symmetry breaking ( such as technicolor ( tc ) theories@xcite ) .",
    "here there are interactions that become strong , typically at the scale @xmath6 ( @xmath7 gev ) , breaking the global @xmath8 symmetry to its diagonal subgroup @xmath9 and producing goldstone bosons which eventually become the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the @xmath10 and @xmath2 . in order to transmit this symmetry breaking to the ordinary matter fields one usually requires additional interactions , characterized by a different scale @xmath11 .",
    "generally , it is assumed that @xmath12 , to keep possible flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) under control@xcite .",
    "thus a distinctive characteristic of these models is that the mechanism giving masses to the @xmath10 and @xmath2 bosons and to the matter fields is different .",
    "where do we stand at present ? some will go as far as saying that an elementary higgs ( supersymmetric or otherwise ) has been ` seen ' through radiative corrections and that its mass is below 200 gev .",
    "others dispute this fact ( see for instance @xcite for a critical review of current claims of a light higgs ) .",
    "the effective lagrangian approach has proven remarkably useful in setting very stringent bounds on some types of new physics taking as input basically the lep@xcite ( and sld@xcite ) experimental results .",
    "the idea is to consider the most general lagrangian which describes the interactions between the gauge sector and the goldstone bosons appearing after the @xmath13 breaking takes place .",
    "no special mechanism is assumed for this breaking and thus the procedure is completely general , assuming of course that particles not explicitly included in the effective lagrangian are much heavier than those appearing in it .",
    "the dependence on the specific model is contained in the coefficients of higher dimensional operators .",
    "so far only the oblique corrections have been analyzed in this way .",
    "our purpose in this work is to extend these techniques to the matter sector of the standard model .",
    "we shall write the leading non - universal operators , determine how their coefficients affect different physical observables and then determine their value in two very general families of models : those containing elementary scalars and those with dynamical symmetry breaking . since the latter become non - perturbative at the @xmath14 scale , effective lagrangian techniques are called for anyway . in short",
    ", we would like to provide the theoretical tools required to test at",
    "least in principle whether the mechanism giving masses to quarks and fermions is the same as that which makes the intermediate vector bosons massive or not without having to get involved in the nitty - gritty details of particular models .",
    "this is mostly a theoretical paper and we shall leave for a later work a more detailed comparison with the current data .",
    "let us start by briefly recalling the salient features of the effective lagrangian analysis of the oblique corrections .    including only those operators which are relevant for oblique corrections , the effective lagrangian reads ( see e.g. @xcite for the complete lagrangian ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 contains the 3 goldstone bosons generated after the breaking of the global symmetry @xmath17 .",
    "the covariant derivative is defined by @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the field - strength tensors corresponding to the right and left gauge groups , respectively @xmath21 and @xmath22 . only terms up to order @xmath23 have been included .",
    "the reason is that dimensional counting arguments suppress , at presently accessible energies , higher dimensional terms , in the hypothesis that all undetected particles are much heavier than those included in the effective lagrangian . while the first term on the r.h.s . of ( [ effobl ] )",
    "is universal ( in the unitary gauge it is just the mass term for the @xmath24 and @xmath2 bosons ) , the coefficients @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are non - universal . in other words , they depend on the specific mechanism responsible for the symmetry breaking .",
    "( throughout this paper the term ` universal ' means ` independent of the specific mechanism triggering @xmath13 breaking ' . )",
    "most @xmath2-physics observables relevant for electroweak physics can be parametrized in terms of vector and axial couplings @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these are , in practice , flavour - dependent since they include vertex corrections which depend on the specific final state .",
    "oblique corrections are however the same for all final states .",
    "the non - universal ( but generation - independent ) contributions to @xmath28 and @xmath29 coming from the effective lagrangian ( [ effobl ] ) are @xmath30 + 2a_1q_fg^2s_w^2 + 2a_8q_fg^2c_w^2 ,   \\label{gagvobl}\\ ] ] @xmath31 they do depend on the specific underlying breaking mechanism through the values of the @xmath32 .",
    "it should be noted that these coefficients depend logarithmically on some unknown scale . in the minimal standard model",
    "the characteristic scale is the higgs boson mass , @xmath3 . in other theories",
    "the scale @xmath3 will be replaced by some other scale @xmath33",
    ". a crucial prediction of chiral perturbation theory is that the dependence on these different scales is logarithmic and actually the same .",
    "it is thus possible to eliminate this dependence by building suitable combinations of @xmath28 and @xmath29@xcite determined by the condition of absence of logs .",
    "whether this line intersects or not the experimentally allowed region is a direct test of the nature of the symmetry breaking sector , independently of the precise value of higgs mass ( in the minimal standard model ) or of the scale of new interactions ( in other scenarios ) does not correspond a standard model ` without the higgs ' .",
    "there are some non - trivial non - decoupling effects ] .",
    "one could also try to extract information about the individual coefficients @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 themselves , and not only on the combinations cancelling the dependence on the unknown scale .",
    "this necessarily implies assuming a specific value for the scale @xmath33 and one should be aware that when considering these cut - off dependent quantities there are finite uncertainties of order @xmath34 associated to the subtraction procedure an unavoidable consequence of using an effective theory , that is often overlooked .",
    "( and recall that using an effective theory is almost mandatory in dynamical symmetry breaking models . ) only finite combinations of coefficients have a universal meaning .",
    "the subtraction scale uncertainty persists when trying to find estimates of the above coefficients via dispersion relations and the like@xcite .    in the previous analysis",
    "it is assumed that the hypothetical new physics contributions from vertex corrections are completely negligible .",
    "but is it so ?",
    "the way to analyze such vertex corrections in a model - independent way is quite similar to the one outlined for the oblique corrections .",
    "we shall introduce in the next section the most general effective lagrangian describing the matter sector . in this sector",
    "there is one universal operator ( playing a role analogous to that of the first operator on the r.h.s . of ( [ effobl ] ) in the purely bosonic sector ) @xmath35 it is an operator of dimension 3 . in the unitary gauge @xmath36 ,",
    "it is just the mass term for the matter fields .",
    "for instance if @xmath37 is the doublet @xmath38 @xmath39 non - universal operators carrying in their coefficients the information on the mechanism giving masses to leptons and quarks will be of dimension 4 and higher .",
    "we shall later derive the values of the coefficients corresponding to operators in the effective lagrangian of dimension 4 within the minimal standard model in the large @xmath3 limit and see how the effective lagrangian provides a convenient way of tracing the higgs mass dependence in physical observables .",
    "we shall later argue that non - decoupling effects should be the same in other theories involving elementary scalars , such as e.g. the two - higgs doublet model , replacing @xmath3 by the appropriate mass .",
    "large non - decoupling effects appear in theories of dynamical symmetry breaking and thus they are likely to produce large contributions to the dimension 4 coefficients . if the scale characteristic of the extended interactions ( i.e. those responsible of the fermion mass generation ) is much larger than the scale characteristic of the electroweak breaking , it makes sense to parametrize the former , at least at low energies , via effective four - fermion operators .",
    "we shall assume here that this clear separation of scales does take place and only in this case are the present techniques really accurate .",
    "the appeareance of pseudo goldstone bosons ( abundant in models of dynamical breaking ) may thus jeopardize our conclusions , as they bring a relatively light scale into the game ( typically even lighter than the fermi scale ) .",
    "in fact , for the observables we consider their contribution is not too important , unless they are extremely light .",
    "for instance a pseudo - goldstone boson of 100 gev can be accommodated without much trouble , as we shall later see .",
    "the four - fermion operators we have just alluded to can involve either four ordinary quarks or leptons ( but we will see that dimensional counting suggests that their contribution will be irrelevant at present energies with the exception of those containing the top quark ) , or two new ( heavy ) fermions and two ordinary ones .",
    "this scenario is quite natural in several extended technicolor ( etc ) or top condensate ( topc ) models@xcite , in which the underlying dynamics is characterized by a scale @xmath11 . at scales",
    "@xmath40 the dynamics can be modelled by four - fermion operators ( of either technifermions in etc models , or ordinary fermions of the third family in topc models ) .",
    "we perform a classification of these operators .",
    "we shall concentrate in the case where technifermions appear in ordinary representations of @xmath0 ( hypercharge can be arbitrary ) .",
    "the classification will then be exhaustive .",
    "we shall discuss other representations as well , although we shall consider custodially preserving operators only , and only those operators which are relevant for our purposes .",
    "as a matter of principle we have tried not to make any assumptions regarding the actual way different generations are embedded in the extended interactions . in practice ,",
    "when presenting our numerical plots and figures , we are assuming that the appropriate group - theoretical factors are similar for all three generations of physical fermions .",
    "it has been our purpose in this paper to be as general as possible , not advocating or trying to put forward any particular theory .",
    "thus , the analysis may , hopefully , remain useful beyond the models we have just used to motivate the problem .",
    "we hope to convey to the reader our belief that a systematic approach based on four - fermion operators and the effective lagrangian treatment can be very useful .",
    "appelquist , bowick , cohler and hauser established some time ago a list of @xmath41 operators@xcite .",
    "these are the operators of lowest dimensionality which are non - universal . in other words",
    ", their coefficients will contain information on whatever mechanism nature has chosen to make quarks and leptons massive .",
    "of course operators of dimensionality 5 , 6 and so on will be generated at the same time .",
    "we shall turn to these later .",

    "it can be reduced to the mass term ( [ mass ] ) @xmath61 however this procedure is , generally speaking , only justified if the matter fields appear only as external legs . for the time being we shall keep @xmath56 $ ] as an independent operator and in the next section",
    "we shall determine its value in the minimal standard model after integrating out a heavy higgs .",
    "we shall see that , after imposing that physical on - shell fields have unit residue , @xmath62 does drop from all physical predictions .    what is the expected size of the @xmath63 coefficients in the minimal standard model ?",
    "this question is easily answered if we take a look at the diagrams that have to be computed to integrate out the higgs field ( figure [ fig-3 ] ) .",

    "diagram d ) is actually of order @xmath65 , which guarantees the gauge independence of the effective lagrangian coefficients .",
    "the diagrams are obviously proportional to @xmath66 , @xmath67 being a yukawa coupling , and also to @xmath68 , since they originate from a one - loop calculation .",
    "finally , the screening theorem shows that they may depend on the higgs mass only logarithmically , therefore @xmath69 these dimensional considerations show that the vertex corrections are only sizeable for third generation quarks .    in models of dynamical symmetry breaking , such as tc or etc",
    ", we shall have new contributions to the @xmath63 from the new physics ( which we shall later parametrize with four - fermion operators ) .",
    "we have several new scales at our disposal .",
    "one is @xmath11 , the mass normalizing dimension six four - fermion operators .",
    "the other can be either @xmath70 ( negligible , since @xmath11 is large ) , @xmath71 , or the dynamically generated mass of the techniquarks @xmath72 ( typically of order @xmath73 , the scale associated to the interactions triggering the breaking of the electroweak group ) .",
    "thus we can get a contribution of order @xmath74 while @xmath72 is , at least naively , expected to be @xmath75 and therefore similar for all flavours , there should be a hierarchy for @xmath11 . as will be discussed in the following sections , the scale @xmath11 which is relevant for the mass generation ( encoded in the only dimension 3 operator in the effective lagrangian ) , via techniquark condensation and etc interaction exchange ( figure  [ fig-4 ] ) , is the one normalizing chirality flipping operators .",
    "on the contrary , the scale normalizing dimension 4 operators in the effective theory is the one that normalizes chirality preserving operators .",
    "both scales need not be exactly the same , and one may envisage a situation with relatively light scalars present where the former can be much lower .",
    "however , it is natural to expect that @xmath11 should at any rate be smallest for the third generation .",
    "consequently the contribution to the @xmath63 s from the third generation should be largest",
    ".    we should also discuss dimension 5 , 6 , etc operators and why we need not include them in our analysis .",

    "these are a few of a long list of about 25 operators , and this including only the ones contributing to the @xmath78 vertex .",
    "all these operators are however chirality flipping and thus their contribution to the amplitude must be suppressed by one additional power of the fermion masses .",
    "this makes their study unnecessary at the present level of precision .",

    "they are generated by the quantum corrections computed by operators such as ( [ mass ] ) or the first operator on the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ effobl ] ) . on the other hand , the feynman diagrams containing the higgs particle contribute to @xmath160 in a twofold way .",
    "one is via the @xmath164 and @xmath23 longhitano effective operators ( [ effobl ] ) which depend on the @xmath32 coefficients , which are higgs - mass dependent , and thus give a higgs - dependent oblique correction to @xmath160 , which is denoted by @xmath165 .",
    "the other one is via genuine vertex corrections which depend on the @xmath63 .",
    "this contribution is denoted by @xmath166 .",
    "the tree - level value for the form factors are @xmath167    in a theory x , different from the minimal standard model , the effective form factors will take values @xmath168 , where @xmath169 and the @xmath170 and @xmath171 are effective coefficients corresponding to theory x.    within one - loop accuracy in the symmetry breaking sector ( but with arbitrary precision elsewhere ) , @xmath165 and @xmath166 are linear functions of their arguments and thus we have @xmath172    the expression for @xmath173 in terms of @xmath32 was already given in ( [ gagvobl ] ) and ( [ gagvvv ] ) .",
    "on the other hand from appendix b we learn that @xmath174 @xmath175    in the minimal standard model all the higgs dependence at the one loop level ( which is the level of accuracy assumed here ) is logarithmic and is contained in the @xmath32 and @xmath63 coefficients",
    ". therefore one can easily construct linear combinations of observables where the leading higgs dependence cancels .",
    "these combinations allow for a test of the minimal standard model independent of the actual value of the higgs mass .",
    "let us now review the comparison with current electroweak data for theories with dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "some confusion seem to exist on this point so let us try to analyze this issue critically .",
    "a first difficulty arises from the fact that at the @xmath14 scale perturbation theory is not valid in theories with dynamical breaking and the contribution from the symmetry breaking sector must be estimated in the framework of the effective theory , which is non - linear and non - renormalizable .",
    "observables will depend on some subtraction scale .",
    "( estimates based on dispersion relations and resonance saturation amount , in practice , to the same , provided that due attention is paid to the scale dependence introduced by the subtraction in the dispersion relation . )",
    "a somewhat related problem is that , when making use of the variables @xmath176 and @xmath64@xcite , or @xmath177 and @xmath178@xcite , one often sees in the literature bounds on possible  new physics \" in the symmetry breaking sector without actually removing the contribution from the standard model higgs that the  new physics \" is supposed to replace ( this is not the case e.g. in @xcite where this issue is discussed with some care ) .",
    "unless the contribution from the  new physics \" is enormous , this is a flagrant case of double counting , but it is easy to understand why this mistake is made : removing the higgs makes the standard model non - renormalizable and the observables of the standard model without the higgs depend on some arbitrary subtraction scale .",
    "in fact the two sources of arbitrary subtraction scales ( the one originating from the removal of the higgs and the one from the effective action treatment ) are one an the same and the problem can be dealt with the help of the coefficients of higher dimensional operators in the effective theory ( i.e. the @xmath32 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "the dependence on the unknown subtraction scale is absorbed in the coefficients of higher dimensional operators and traded by the scale of the  new physics \" .",
    "combinations of observables can be built where this scale ( and the associated renormalization ambiguities ) drops .",
    "these combinations allow for a test of the  new physics \" independently of the actual value of its characteristic scale .",
    "in fact they are the same combinations of observables where the higgs dependence drops in the minimal standard model .",
    "a third difficulty in making a fair comparison of models of dynamical symmetry breaking with experiment lies in the vertex corrections . if we analyze the lepton effective couplings @xmath179 and @xmath180 , the minimal standard model predicts very small vertex corrections arising from the symmetry breaking sector anyway and it is consistent to ignore them and concentrate in the oblique corrections .",
    "however , this is not the situation in dynamical symmetry breaking models .",
    "we will see in the next sections that for the second and third generation vertex corrections can be sizeable . thus if we want to compare experiment to oblique corrections in models of dynamical breaking we have to concentrate on electron couplings only .    in figure  [ fig-1 ]",
    "we see the prediction of the minimal standard model for @xmath181 gev and @xmath182 gev including the leading two - loop corrections@xcite , falling nicely within the experimental @xmath183 region for the electron effective couplings . in this and in subsequent plots we present the data form the combined four lep experiments only .",
    "what is the actual prediction for a theory with dynamical symmetry breaking ? the straight solid lines correspond to the prediction of a qcd - like technicolor model with @xmath184 and @xmath185 ( a one - generation model ) in the case where all technifermion masses are assumed to be equal ( we follow @xcite , see @xcite for related work ) allowing the same variation for the top mass as in the standard model .",
    "we do not take into account here the contribution of potentially present pseudo goldstone bosons , assuming that they can be made heavy enough .",
    "the corresponding values for the @xmath32 coefficients in such a model are given in appendix e and are derived using chiral quark model techniques and chiral perturbation theory .",
    "they are scale dependent in such a way as to make observables finite and unambiguous , but of course observables depend in general on the scale of  new physics \" @xmath33 .",
    "we move along the straight lines by changing the scale @xmath33 .",
    "it would appear at first sight that one needs to go to unacceptably low values of the new scale to actually penetrate the @xmath186 region , something which looks unpleasant at first sight ( we have plotted the part of the line for @xmath187 gev ) , as one expects @xmath188 . in fact",
    "this is not necessarily so .",
    "there is no real prediction of the effective theory _ along _ the straight lines , because only combinations which are @xmath33-independent are predictable .",
    "as for the location not _ along _ the line , but _ of _ the line itself it is in principle calculable in the effective theory , but of course subject to the uncertainties of the model one relies upon , since we are dealing with a strongly coupled theory .",
    "( we shall use chiral quark model estimates in this paper as we believe that they are quite reliable for qcd - like theories , see the discussion below . )",
    "if we allow for a splitting in the technifermion masses the comparison with experiment improves very slightly .",
    "the values of the effective lagrangian coefficients relevant for the oblique corrections in the case of unequal masses are also given in appendix e. since @xmath26 is independent of the technifermion dynamically generated masses anyway , the dependence is fully contained in @xmath25 ( the parameter @xmath189 of peskin and takeuchi@xcite ) and @xmath27 ( the parameter @xmath64 ) .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig-2 ] .",
    "we assume that the splitting is the same for all doublets , which is not necessarily true .",
    "if other representations of the @xmath0 gauge group are used , the oblique corrections have to be modified in the form prescribed in section 8 .",
    "larger group theoretical factors lead to larger oblique corrections and , from this point of view , the restriction to weak doublets and colour singlets or triplets is natural .",
    "let us close this section by justifying the use of chiral quark model techniques , trying to assess the errors involved , and at the same time emphasizing the importance of having the scale dependence under control .",
    "a parameter like @xmath26 ( or @xmath121 in the notation of peskin and takeuchi@xcite ) contains information about the long - distance properties of a strongly coupled theory . in fact",
    ", @xmath26 is nothing but the familiar @xmath190 parameter of the strong chiral lagrangian of gasser and leutwyler@xcite translated to the electroweak sector .",
    "this strong interaction parameter can be measured and it is found to be @xmath191 ( at the @xmath192 scale , which is just the conventional reference value and plays no specific role in the standard model . )",
    "this is almost twice the value predicted by the chiral quark model@xcite ( @xmath193 ) , which is the estimate plotted in figure  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "does this mean that the chiral quark model grossly underestimates this observable ?",
    "not at all .",
    "chiral perturbation theory predicts the running of @xmath190 .",
    "it is given by @xmath194 according to our current understanding ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the chiral quark model gives the value of the chiral coefficients at the chiral symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath195 in qcd , @xmath196 in the electroweak theory ) .",
    "then the coefficient @xmath197 ( or @xmath26 for that matter ) predicted within the chiral quark model agrees with qcd at the 10% level .",
    "let us now turn to the issue of vertex corrections in theories with dynamical symmetry breaking and the determination of the coefficients @xmath63 which are , after all , the focal point of this work .",
    "in order to have a picture in our mind , let us assume that at sufficiently high energies the symmetry breaking sector can be described by some renormalizable theory , perhaps a non - abelian gauge theory . by some unspecified mechanism some of the carriers of the new interaction acquire a mass .",
    "let us generically denote this mass by @xmath11 .",
    "one type of models that comes immediately to mind is the extended technicolor scenario .",
    "@xmath11 would then be the mass of the etc bosons .",
    "let us try , however , not to adhere to any specific mechanism or model .",
    "below the scale @xmath11 we shall describe our underlying theory by four - fermion operators .",
    "this is a convenient way of parametrizing the new physics below @xmath198 without needing to commit oneself to a particular model .",
    "of course the number of all possible four - fermion operators is enormous and one may think that any predictive power is lost .",
    "this is not so because of two reasons : a ) the size of the coefficients of the four fermion operators is not arbitrary .",
    "they are constrained by the fact that at scale @xmath11 they are given by @xmath199 where @xmath200 is built out of clebsch - gordan factors and @xmath201 a gauge coupling constant , assumed perturbative of @xmath202 at the scale @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath200 being essentially group - theoretical factors are probably of similar size for all three generations , although not necessarily identical as this would assume a particular style of embedding the different generations into the large etc ( for instance ) group .",
    "notice that for four - fermion operators of the form @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is some fermion bilinear , @xmath200 has a well defined sign , but this is not so for other operators .",
    "b ) it turns out that only a relatively small number of combinations of these coefficients do actually appear in physical observables at low energies .    matching to the fundamental physical theory at @xmath205 fixes the value of the coupling constants accompanying the four - fermion operators to the value ( [ 4qcoef ] ) .",
    "in addition contact terms , i.e. non - zero values for the effective coupling constants @xmath63 , are generally speaking required in order for the fundamental and four - fermion theories to match .",
    "these will later evolve under the renormalization group due to the presence of the four - fermion interactions . because we expect that @xmath206 , the @xmath63 will be typically logarithmically enhanced .",
    "notice that there is no guarantee that this is the case for the third generation , as we will later discuss . in this case the tc and etc dynamics would be tangled up ( which for most models is strongly disfavoured by the constraints on oblique corrections ) .",
    "for the first and second generation , however , the logarithmic enhancement of the @xmath63 is a potentially large correction and it actually makes the treatment of a fundamental theory via four - fermion operators largely independent of the particular details of specific models , as we will see .",
    "let us now get back to four - fermion operators and proceed to a general classification .",
    "a first observation is that , while in the bosonic sector custodial symmetry is just broken by the small @xmath207 gauge interactions , which is relatively small , in the matter sector the breaking is not that small .",
    "we thus have to assume that whatever underlying new physics is present at scale @xmath11 it gives rise both to custodially preserving and custodially non - preserving four - fermion operators with coefficients of similar strength .",
    "obvious requirements are hermiticity , lorentz invariance and @xmath208 symmetry . neither @xmath209 nor @xmath210 invariance are imposed , but invariance under @xmath211 is assumed .",
    "we are interested in @xmath212 four - fermion operators constructed with two ordinary fermions ( either leptons or quarks ) , denoted by @xmath213 , @xmath214 , and two fermions @xmath215 , @xmath216 .",
    "typically @xmath217 will be the technicolor index and the @xmath218 , @xmath219 will therefore be techniquarks and technileptons , but we may be as well interested in the case where the @xmath220 may be ordinary fermions . in this case the index @xmath217 drops ( in our subsequent formulae this will correspond to taking @xmath221 ) .",
    "we shall not write the index @xmath217 hereafter for simplicity , but this degree of freedom is explicitly taken into account in our results .",
    "as we already mention we shall discuss in detail the case where the additional fermions fall into ordinary representations of @xmath0 and will discuss other representations later .",
    "the fields @xmath218 will therefore transform as @xmath222 doublets and we shall group the right - handed fields @xmath219 into doublets as well , but then include suitable insertions of @xmath223 to consider custodially breaking operators . in order to determine the low energy remnants of all these four - fermion operators ( i.e. the coefficients @xmath63 ) it is enough to know their couplings to @xmath222 and no further assumptions about their electric charges ( or hypercharges ) are needed . of course , since the @xmath218 , @xmath219 couple to the electroweak gauge bosons they must not lead to new anomalies .",
    "the simplest possibility is to assume they reproduce the quantum numbers of one family of quarks and leptons ( that is , a total of four doublets @xmath185 ) , but other possibilities exist ( for instance @xmath224 is also possible@xcite , although this model presents a global @xmath222 anomaly ) .    we shall first be concerned with the @xmath218 , @xmath219 fields belonging to the representation @xmath225 of @xmath226 and afterwards , focus in the simpler case where the @xmath218 , @xmath219 are colour singlet ( technileptons ) .",
    "coloured @xmath218 , @xmath219 fermions can couple to ordinary quarks and leptons either via the exchange of a colour singlet or of a colour octet . in addition",
    "the exchanged particle can be either an @xmath222 triplet or a singlet , thus leading to a large number of possible four - fermion operators .",
    "more important for our purposes will be whether they flip or not the chirality .",
    "we use fierz rearrangements in order to write the four - fermion operators as product of either two colour singlet or two colour octet currents .",
    "a complete list is presented in table [ table-2 ] and table [ table-3 ] for the chirality preserving and chirality flipping operators , respectively .",
    ".four - fermion operators which do not change the fermion chirality .",
    "the first ( second ) column contains the custodially preserving ( breaking ) operators . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that the two upper blocks of table  [ table-2 ] contain operators of the form @xmath227 , where ( @xmath204 ) @xmath228 stands for a ( heavy ) fermion current with well defined colour and flavour numbers ; namely , belonging to an irreducible representation of @xmath226 and @xmath222 .",
    "in contrast , those in the two lower blocks are not of this form . in order to make their physical content more transparent",
    ", we can perform a fierz transformation and replace the last nine operators ( two lower blocks ) in table  [ table-2 ] by those in table  [ table-4 ] . these two basis",
    "are related by @xmath229^j)&= & \\half r_3r+\\third r_3r\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for coloured techniquarks .",
    "notice the appearance of some minus signs due to the fierzing and that operators such as @xmath230 ( for instance ) get contributions from four fermions operators which do have a well defined sign as well as from others which do not .",
    "the use of this basis simplifies the calculations considerably as the dirac structure is simpler .",
    "another obvious advantage of this basis , which will become apparent only later , is that it will make easier to consider the long distance contributions to the @xmath63 , from the region of momenta @xmath231 .",
    "the classification of the chirality preserving operator involving technileptons is of course simpler .",
    "again we use fierz rearrangements to write the operators as @xmath232 .",
    "however , in this case only a colour singlet @xmath204 ( and , thus , also a colour singlet @xmath228 ) can occur .",
    "hence , the complete list can be obtained by crossing out from table [ table-4 ] and from the first eight rows of table  [ table-2 ] the operators involving @xmath233 .",
    "namely , those designated by lower - case letters .",
    "we are then left with the two operators @xmath234 , @xmath235 from table  [ table-4 ] and with the first six rows of table  [ table-2 ] : @xmath230 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "if we choose to work instead with the original basis of chirality preserving operators in table  [ table-2 ] , we have to supplement these nine operators in the first six rows of the table with @xmath244 and @xmath245 , which are the only independent ones from the last seven rows .",
    "these two basis are related by @xmath246 for technileptons .",
    "it should be borne in mind that fierz transformations , as presented in the above discussion , are strictly valid only in four dimensions . in @xmath247 dimensions for the identities to hold we need ` evanescent ' operators@xcite , which vanish in 4 dimensions .",
    "however the replacement of some four - fermion operators in terms of others via the fierz identities is actually made inside a loop of technifermions and therefore a finite contribution is generated .",
    "thus the two basis will eventually be equivalent up to terms of order @xmath248 where @xmath72 is the mass of the technifermion ( this estimate will be obvious only after the discussion in the next sections ) .",
    "in particular no logarithms can appear in ( [ fier ] ) .",
    "let us now discuss how the appeareance of other representations might enlarge the above classification",
    ". we shall not be completely general here , but consider only those operators that may actually contribute to the observables we have been discussing ( such as @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "furthermore , for reasons that shall be obvious in a moment , we shall restrict ourselves to operators which are @xmath249 invariant .",
    "the construction of the chirality conserving operators for fermions in higher dimensional representations of @xmath250 follows essentially the same pattern presented in the appendix for doublet fields , except for the fact that operators such as @xmath251 and their right - handed versions , which appear on the right hand side of table 1 , are now obviously not acceptable since @xmath218 and @xmath213 are in different representations .",
    "those operators , restricting ourselves to color singlet bilinears ( the only ones giving a non - zero contribution to our observables ) can be replaced in the fundamental representation by @xmath252 when we move to the @xmath227 basis .",
    "now it is clear how to modify the above when using higher representations for the @xmath220 fields . the first one is already included in our set of custodially preserving operators , while the second one has to be modified to @xmath253 where @xmath254 are the @xmath250 generators in the relevant representation .",
    "in addition we have the right - handed counterpart , of course .",
    "we could in principle now proceed to construct custodially violating operators by introducing suitable @xmath255 and @xmath223 matrices .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to present a closed set of operators of this type , as the number of independent operators does obviously depend on the dimensionality of the representation .",
    "for this reason we shall only consider custodially preserving operators when moving to higher representations , namely @xmath230 , @xmath236 , @xmath240 , @xmath242 , @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "if we examine tables 1 , 2 and 3 we will notice that both chirality violating and chirality preserving operators appear .",
    "it is clear that at the leading order in an expansion in external fermion masses only the chirality preserving operators ( tables  [ table-2 ] and  [ table-4 ] ) are important , those operators containing both a @xmath213 and a @xmath214 field will be further suppressed by additional powers of the masses of the fermions and thus subleading .",
    "furthermore , if we limit our analysis to the study of the effective @xmath10 and @xmath2 couplings , such as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , as we do here , chirality - flipping operators can contribute only through a two - loop effect .",
    "thus the contribution from the chirality flipping operators contained in table 2 is suppressed both by an additional @xmath68 loop factor and by a @xmath258 chirality factor .",
    "if for the sake of the argument we take @xmath72 to be 400 gev , the correction will be below or at the 10% level for values of @xmath11 as low as 100 gev .",
    "this automatically eliminates from the game operators generated through the exchange of a heavy scalar particle , but of course the presence of light scalars , below the mentioned limit , renders their neglection unjustified .",
    "it is not clear where simple etc models violate this limit ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we just assume that all scalar particles can be made heavy enough .",
    "additional light scalars may also appear as pseudo goldstone bosons at the moment the electroweak symmetry breaking occurs due to @xmath259 condensation .",
    "we had to assume somehow that their contribution to the oblique correction was small ( e.g. by avoiding their proliferation and making them sufficiently heavy ) .",
    "they also contribute to vertex corrections ( and thus to the @xmath63 ) , but here their contribution is naturally suppresed .",
    "the coupling of a pseudo goldstone boson @xmath260 to ordinary fermions is of the form @xmath261 thus their contribution to the @xmath63 will be or order @xmath262 using the same reference values as above a pseudo goldstone boson of 100 gev can be neglected .    if the operators contained in table 2",
    "are not relevant for the @xmath10 and @xmath2 couplings , what are they important for ?",
    "after electroweak breaking ( due to the strong technicolor forces or any other mechanism ) a condensate @xmath263 emerges .",
    "the chirality flipping operators are then responsible for generating a mass term for ordinary quarks and leptons .",
    "their low energy effects are contained in the only @xmath264 operator appearing in the matter sector , discussed in section 2 .",
    "we thus see that the four fermion approach allows for a nice separation between the operators responsible for mass generation and those that may eventually lead to observable consequences in the @xmath10 and @xmath2 couplings .",
    "one may even entertain the possibility that the relevant scale is , for some reason , different for both sets of operators ( or , at least , for some of them ) .",
    "it could , at least in principle , be the case that scalar exchange enhances the effect of chirality flipping operators , allowing for large masses for the third generation , without giving unacceptably large contributions to the @xmath2 effective coupling . whether one is able to find a satisfactory fundamental theory where this is the case is another matter , but the four - fermion approach allows , at least , to pose the problem .",
    "we shall now proceed to determine the constants @xmath63 appearing in the effective lagrangian after integration of the heavy degrees of freedom . for the sake of the discussion we shall assume hereafter that technifermions are degenerate in mass and set their masses equal to @xmath72 .",
    "the general case is discussed in appendix e.",
    "at the scale @xmath205 we integrate out the heavier degrees of freedom by matching the renormalised green functions computed in the underlying fundamental theory to a four - fermion interaction .",
    "this matching leads to the values ( [ 4qcoef ] ) for the coefficients of the four - fermion operators as well as to a purely short distance contribution for the @xmath116 , which shall be denoted by @xmath265 .",
    "the matching procedure is indicated in figure  [ fig-5 ] .",
    "it is perhaps useful to think of the @xmath265 as the value that the coefficients of the effective lagrangian take at the matching scale , as they contain the information on modes of frequencies @xmath266 .",
    "the @xmath265 will be , in general , divergent , i.e. they will have a pole in @xmath132 .",
    "let us see how to obtain these coefficients @xmath265 in a particular case .    as discussed in the previous section we understand that at very high energies our theory is described by a gauge theory .",
    "therefore we have to add to the standard model lagrangian ( already extended with technifermions ) the following pieces @xmath267 the @xmath268 vector boson ( of mass @xmath11 ) acts in a large flavour group space which mixes ordinary fermions with heavy ones .",
    "( the notation in ( [ eboson ] ) is somewhat symbolic as we are not implying that the theory is vector - like , in fact we do not assume anything at all about it . )    at energies @xmath40 we can describe the contribution from this sector to the effective lagrangian coefficients either using the degrees of freedom present in ( [ eboson ] ) or via the corresponding four quark operator and a non - zero value for the @xmath265 coefficients .",
    "demanding that both descriptions reproduce the same renormalised @xmath269 vertex fixes the value of the @xmath265 .",
    "let us see this explicitly in the case where the intermediate vector boson @xmath268 is a @xmath270 singlet . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we take the third term in  ( [ eboson ] ) to be @xmath271 at energies below @xmath11 , the relevant four quark operator is then @xmath272 in the limit of degenerate techniquark masses , it is quite clear that only @xmath273 can be different from zero .",
    "thus , one does not need to worry about matching quark self - energies .",
    "concerning the vertex ( figure  [ fig-5 ] ) , we have to impose eq .",
    "( [ match-2 ] ) , where now @xmath274 namely , @xmath275 is the difference between the vertex computed using  ( [ eboson ] ) and the same quantity computed using the four quark operators as well as non zero @xmath276 coefficients ( recall that the hat in  ( [ match-2 ] ) denotes renormalised quantities ) .",
    "a calculation analogous to that of section  [ 31.7 - 1 ] ( now the leading terms in @xmath277 are retained ) leads to @xmath278",
    "as we move down in energies we can integrate lower and lower frequencies with the help of the four - fermion operators ( which do accurately describe physics below @xmath11 ) .",
    "this modifies the value of the @xmath63 @xmath279 the quantity @xmath280 can be computed in perturbation theory down to the scale @xmath196 where the residual interactions labelled by the index @xmath217 becomes strong and confine the technifermions .",
    "the leading contribution is given by a loop of technifermions .",
    "to determine such contribution it is necessary to demand that the renormalised green functions match when computed using explicitly the degrees of freedom @xmath218 , @xmath219 and when their effect is described via the effective lagrangian coefficients @xmath63 .",
    "the matching procedure is illustrated in figure  [ fig-6 ] .",
    "the scale @xmath281 of the matching must be such that @xmath282 , but such that @xmath283 , where perturbation theory in the technicolour coupling constant starts being questionable .",
    "the result of the calculation in the case of degenerate masses is @xmath284 where we have kept the logarithmically enhanced contribution only and have neglected any other possible constant pieces .",
    "@xmath285 is the singular part of @xmath265 .",
    "the finite parts of @xmath265 are clearly very model dependent ( cfr .",
    "for instance the previous discussion on evanescent operators ) and we can not possibly take them into account in a general analysis . accordingly , we ignore all other terms in ( [ logg ] ) as well as those finite pieces generated through the fierzing procedure ( see discussion in previous section ) .",
    "keeping the logarithmically enhanced terms therefore sets the level of accuracy of our calculation",
    ". we will call ( [ short ] ) the short - distance contribution to the coefficient @xmath63 .",
    "general formulae for the case where the two technifermions are not degenerate in masses can be found in appendix e.    notice that the final short distance contribution to the @xmath63 is ultraviolet finite , as it should .",
    "the divergences in @xmath265 are exactly matched by those in @xmath286 .",
    "the pole in @xmath265 combined with singularity in @xmath286 provides a finite contribution .",
    "there is another potential source of corrections to the @xmath63 stemming from the renormalization of the four fermion coupling constant @xmath287 ( similar to the renormalization of the fermi constant in the electroweak theory due to gluon exchange ) .",
    "this effect is however subleading here .",
    "the reason is that we are considering technigluon exchange only for four - fermion operators of the form @xmath227 , where , again , @xmath228 ( @xmath204 ) stands for a ( heavy ) fermion current ( which give the leading contribution , as discussed ) .",
    "the fields carrying technicolour have the same handedness and thus there is no multiplicative renormalization and the effect is absent .    of course in addition to the short distance contribution",
    "there is a long - distance contribution from the region of integration of momenta @xmath288 .",
    "perturbation theory in the technicolour coupling constant is questionable and we have to resort to other methods to determine the value of the @xmath63 at the @xmath2 mass .",
    "there are two possible ways of doing so .",
    "one is simply to mimic the constituent chiral quark model of qcd .",
    "there one loop of chiral quarks with momentum running between the scale of chiral symmetry breaking and the scale of the constituent mass of the quark , which acts as infrared cut - off , provide the bulk of the contribution@xcite to @xmath289 , which is the equivalent of @xmath90 . making the necessary translations we can write for qcd - like theories @xmath290    alternatively",
    ", we can use chiral lagrangian techniques@xcite to write a low - energy bosonized version of the technifermion bilinears @xmath291 and @xmath292 using the chiral currents @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "the translation is @xmath295 @xmath296 @xmath297 @xmath298 other currents do not contribute to the effective coefficients .",
    "both methods agree .",
    "finally , we collect all contributions to the coefficients @xmath63 of the effective lagrangian . for fields in the usual representations of the gauge group @xmath299 while in the case of higher representations , where only custodially preserving operators have been considered , only @xmath58 and @xmath59 get non - zero values ( through @xmath300 and @xmath301 ) .",
    "the long distance contribution is , obviously , universal ( see section 2 ) , while we have to modify the short distance contribution by replacing the casimir of the fundamental representation of @xmath250 for the appropriate one ( @xmath302 ) , the number of doublets by the multiplicity of the given representation , and @xmath137 by the appropriate dimensionality of the @xmath303 representation to which the @xmath220 fields belong .",
    "these expressions require several comments .",
    "first of all , they contain the same ( universal ) divergences as their counterparts in the minimal standard model .",
    "the scale @xmath33 should , in principle , correspond to the matching scale @xmath196 , where the low - energy non - linear effective theory takes over .",
    "however , we write an arbitrary scale just to remind us that the finite part accompanying the log is regulator dependent and can not be determined within the effective theory . recall that the leading @xmath304 term is finite and unambiguous , and that the ambiguity lies in the formally subleading term ( which , however , due to the log is numerically quite important ) .",
    "furthermore only logarithmically enhanced terms are included in the above expressions .",
    "finally one should bear in mind that the chiral quark model techniques that we have used are accurate only in the large @xmath305 expansion ( actually @xmath306 here ) .",
    "the same comments apply of course to the oblique coefficients @xmath32 presented in the appendix .",
    "the quantities @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath309 , @xmath310 and @xmath311 are the coefficients of the four - fermion operators indicated by the sub - index ( a combination of clebsch - gordan and fierzing factors ) .",
    "they depend on the specific model .",
    "as discussed in previous sections these coefficients can be of either sign .",
    "this observation is important because it shows that the contribution to the effective coefficients has no definite sign@xcite indeed .",
    "it is nice that there is almost a one - to - one correspondence between the effective lagrangian coefficients ( all of them measurable , at least in principle ) and four - fermion coefficients .",
    "apart from these four - fermion coefficients , the @xmath63 depend on a number of quantities ( @xmath90 , @xmath72 , @xmath196 , @xmath201 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "let us first discuss those related to the electroweak symmetry breaking , ( @xmath72 and @xmath196 ) and postpone the considerations on @xmath11 to the next section ( @xmath201 will be assumed to be of @xmath202 ) .",
    "@xmath90 is of course the fermi scale and hence not an unknown at all ( @xmath312 gev ) .",
    "the value of @xmath72 can be estimated from ( [ v2 ] ) since @xmath313 is known and @xmath196 , for qcd - like technicolor theories is @xmath314 . solving for @xmath72 one finds that if @xmath185 , @xmath315 , while if @xmath224 , @xmath316 .",
    "notice that @xmath72 and @xmath90 depend differently on @xmath305 so it is not correct to simply assume @xmath315 . in theories where the technicolor @xmath317 function is small ( and it is pretty small",
    "if @xmath185 and @xmath184 ) the characteristic scale of the breaking is pushed upwards , so we expect @xmath318 .",
    "this brings @xmath72 somewhat downwards , but the decrease is only logarithmic .",
    "we shall therefore take @xmath72 to be in the range 250 to 450 gev .",
    "we shall allow for a mass splitting within the doublets too .",
    "the splitting within each doublet can not be too large , as figure [ fig-2 ] shows .",
    "for simplicity we shall assume an equal splitting of masses for all doublets .",
    "let us first summarize our results so far .",
    "the values of the effective lagrangian coefficients encode the information about the symmetry breaking sector that is ( and will be in the near future ) experimentally accessible .",
    "the @xmath63 are therefore the counterpart of the oblique corrections coefficients @xmath32 and they have to be taken together in precision analysis of the standard model , even if they are numerically less significant .",
    "these effective coefficients apply to @xmath2-physics at lep , top production at the next linear collider , measurements of the top decay at cdf , or indeed any other process involving the third generation ( where their effect is largest ) , provided the energy involved is below @xmath319 , the limit of applicability of chiral techniques .",
    "( of course chiral effective lagrangian techniques fails well below @xmath319 if a resonance is present in a given channel , see also @xcite . )    in the standard model the @xmath63 are useful to keep track of the @xmath320 dependence in all processes involving either neutral or charged currents .",
    "they also provide an economical description of the symmetry breaking sector , in the sense that they contain the relevant information in the low - energy regime , the only one testable at present . beyond the standard model the new physics contributions",
    "is parametrized by four - fermion operators . by choosing the number of doublets , @xmath72 , @xmath11 , and @xmath196 suitably ,",
    "we are in fact describing in a single shot a variety of theories : extended technicolor ( commuting and non - commuting ) , walking technicolor@xcite or top - assisted technicolor , provided that all remaining scalars and pseudo - goldstone bosons are sufficiently heavy .",
    "the accuracy of the calculation is limited by a number of approximations we have been forced to make and which have been discussed at length in previous sections . in practice",
    "we retain only terms which are logarithmically enhanced when running from @xmath11 to @xmath72 , including the long distance part , below @xmath196 .",
    "the effective lagrangian coefficients @xmath63 are all finite at the scale @xmath196 , the lower limit of applicability of perturbation theory . below that scale",
    "they run following the renormalization group equations of the non - linear theory and new divergences have to be subtracted s has to be removed , though , as discussed in section 5 , so the difference is finite and would be fully predictable , had we good theoretical control on the subleading corrections . at present",
    "only the @xmath304 contribution is under reasonable control . ] .",
    "these coefficients contain finally the contribution from scales @xmath321 , the dynamically generated mass of the technifermion ( expected to be of @xmath322 . in view of the theoretical uncertainties , to restrict oneself to logarithmically enhanced terms is a very reasonable approximation which should capture the bulk of the contribution .",
    "let us now proceed to a more detailed discussion of the implications of our analysis .",
    "let us begin by discussing the value that we should take for @xmath11 , the mass scale normalizing four - fermion operators .",
    "fermion condensation gives a mass to ordinary fermions via chirality - flipping operators of order @xmath323 through the operators listed in table [ table-3 ] .",
    "a chiral quark model calculation shows that @xmath324 thus , while @xmath325 is universal , there is an inverse relation between @xmath326 and @xmath327 . in qcd - like theories",
    "this leads to the following rough estimates for the mass @xmath11 ( the subindex refers to the fermion which has been used in the l.h.s . of ( [ mfer ] ) ) @xmath328 if taken at face value , the scale for @xmath329 is too low , even the one for @xmath330 may already conflict with current bounds on fcnc , unless they are suppressed by some other mechanism in a natural way .",
    "worse , the top mass can not be reasonably reproduced by this mechanism .",
    "this well - known problem can be partly alleviated in theories where technicolor walks or invoking top - colour or a similar mechanism @xcite ) . then @xmath11 can be made larger and @xmath72 , as discussed , somewhat smaller . for theories which are",
    "not vector - like the above estimates become a lot less reliable",
    ".    however one should not forget that none of the four - fermion operators playing a role in the vertex effective couplings participates at all in the fermion mass determination . in principle we can then entertain the possibility that the relevant mass scale for the latter should be lower ( perhaps because they get a contribution through scalar exchange , as some of them can be generated this way ) . even in this case",
    "it seems just natural that @xmath329 ( the scale normalizing chirality preserving operators for the third generation , that is ) is low and not too different from @xmath196 .",
    "thus the logarithmic enhancement is pretty much absent in this case and some of the approximations made become quite questionable in this case .",
    "( although even for the @xmath331 couplings there is still a relatively large contribution to the @xmath63 s coming from long distance contributions . )",
    "put in another words , unless an additional mechanism is invoked , it is not really possible to make definite estimates for the @xmath331-effective couplings without getting into the details of the underlying theory .",
    "the flavour dynamics and electroweak breaking are completely entangled in this case .",
    "if one only retains the long distance part ( which is what we have done in practice ) we can , at best , make order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "however , what is remarkable in a way is that this does not happen for the first and second generation vertex corrections .",
    "the effect of flavour dynamics can then be encoded in a small number of coefficients .",
    "we shall now discuss in some detail the numerical consequences of our assumptions .",
    "we shall assume the above values for the mass scale @xmath11 ; in other words , we shall place ourselves in the most disfavourable situation .",
    "we shall only present results for qcd - like theories and @xmath185 exclusively . for other theories the appropriate results",
    "can be very easily obtained from our formulae .",
    "for the coefficients @xmath307 , @xmath332 , @xmath310 , etc .",
    "we shall use the range of variation [ -2 , 2 ] ( since they are expected to be of @xmath202 ) . of course larger values of the scale , @xmath11 , would simply translate into smaller values for those coefficients , so the results can be easily scaled down .",
    "figure  [ fig-7 ] shows the @xmath333 electron effective couplings when vertex corrections are included and allowed to vary within the stated limits . to avoid clutter ,",
    "the top mass is taken to the central value 175.6 gev .",
    "the standard model prediction is shown as a function of the higgs mass .",
    "the dotted lines in figure [ fig-7 ] correspond to considering the oblique corrections only .",
    "vertex corrections change these results and , depending on the values of the four - fermion operator coefficients , the prediction can take any value in the strip limited by the two solid lines ( as usual we have no specific prediction in the direction along the strip due to the dependence on @xmath33 , inherited from the non - renormalizable character of the effective theory ) .",
    "a generic modification of the electron couplings is of @xmath334 , small but much larger than in the standard model and , depending on its sign , may help to bring a better agreement with the central value .",
    "the modifications are more dramatic in the case of the second generation , for the muon , for instance .",
    "now , we expect changes in the @xmath63 s and , eventually , in the effective couplings of @xmath335 these modifications are just at the limit of being observable . they could even modify the relation between @xmath336 and @xmath337 ( i.e. @xmath338 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig-8 ] shows a similar plot for the bottom effective couplings @xmath339 .",
    "it is obvious that taking generic values for the four - fermion operators ( of @xmath202 ) leads to enormous modifications in the effective couplings , unacceptably large in fact .",
    "the corrections become more manageable if we allow for a smaller variation of the four - fermion operator coefficients ( in the range [ -0.1,0.1 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the natural order of magnitude for the mass @xmath329 is @xmath340 tev , at least for chirality preserving operators .",
    "as we have discussed the corrections can be of either sign .",
    "one could , at least in the case of degenerate masses , translate the experimental constraints on the @xmath63 ( recall that their experimental determination requires a combination of charged and neutral processes , since there are six of them ) to the coefficients of the four - fermion operators . doing so would provide us with a four - fermion effective theory that would exactly reproduce all the available data .",
    "it is obvious however that the result would not be very satisfactory .",
    "while the outcome would , most likely , be coefficients of @xmath202 for the electron couplings , they would have to be of @xmath341 , perhaps smaller for the bottom .",
    "worse , the same masses we have used lead to unacceptably low values for the top mass ( [ mfer ] ) . allowing for a different scale in the chirality flipping operators would permit a large top mass without affecting the effective couplings . taking this as a tentative possibility we can pose the following problem : measure the effective couplings @xmath63 for all three generations and determine the values of the four - fermion operator coefficients and the characteristic mass scale that fits the data best . in the degenerate mass limit we have a total of 8 unknowns ( 5 of them coefficients , expected to be of @xmath202 ) and 18 experimental values ( three sets of the @xmath63 ) .",
    "a similar exercise could be attempted in the chirality flipping sector .",
    "if the solution to this exercise turned out to be mathematically consistent ( within the experimental errors ) it would be extremely interesting .",
    "a negative result would certainly rule out this approach .",
    "notice that dynamical symmetry breaking predicts the pattern @xmath342 , while in the standard model @xmath343 .",
    "we should end with some words of self - criticism .",
    "it may seem that the previous discussion is not too conclusive and that we have managed only to rephrase some of the long - standing problems in the symmetry breaking sector .",
    "however , the _ raison dtre _ of the present paper is not really to propose a solution to these problems , but rather to establish a theoretical framework to treat them systematically .",
    "experience from the past shows that often the effects of new physics are magnified and thus models are ruled out on this basis , only to find out that a careful and rigorous analysis leaves some room for them .",
    "we believe that this may be the case in dynamical symmetry breaking models and we believe too that only through a detailed and careful comparison with the experimental data will progress take place .",
    "the effective lagrangian provides the tools to look for an ` existence proof ' ( or otherwise ) of a phenomenologically viable , mathematically consistent dynamical symmetry breaking model .",
    "we hope that there is any time soon sufficient experimental data to attempt to determine the four - fermion coefficients , at lest approximately .",
