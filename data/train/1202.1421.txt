    "bif@xmath0 , however , is by far more sensible : it is reported that it has orthorhombic crystal structure ( tysonite structure , @xmath11 space symmetry group ) @xcite . however , the melting point given there @xcite is with @xmath12c @xmath13k higher than the value that is measured in this study .",
    "an older study reports bif@xmath0 to be cubic @xcite ( gananite , pdf 39 - 345 ) , and this is in agreement with x - ray spectra that were performed in the framework of the current study .",
    "bif@xmath0 is a stable chemical under ambient conditions , aside from minor hygroscopicity , and melts congruently at about @xmath14c without polymorphism @xcite .",
    "the different data on bif@xmath0 may be explained by a susceptibility of contamination of the compound by oxygen and humidity , a trait common to many fluorides @xcite .",
    "degradation of samples , crucibles and even thermal sensors employed during measurements are cited by numerous authors @xcite , hence worsening reproducibility of data .",
    "it should be mentioned that the materials used in those works ",
    "vitrified carbon , platinum , nickel  are known for being resistant to the chemical corrosion of fluorides , which are very aggressive at high temperature @xcite .",
    "novikova _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that the degradation of samples containing bif@xmath0 is due to the reduction of this compound by the materials of the crucibles and sensors upon heating .",
    "schultheiss , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , however , presented detailed evidence that pure bif@xmath0 is not responsible for the damage .",
    "instead , the presence of contaminants ( oxygen and water related ions ) leads to partial hydrolysis of bif@xmath0 and may result in damage by the formation of bi@xmath15o@xmath0 or metallic bismuth .",

    "graphite crucibles with platinum lids and compounds of high purity were used : bif@xmath0 99.999% ( metals basis ) from alfa aesar and lif from aldrich , initially only 99.9% pure .",
    "the lif , however , was refined by zone melting under ar / hf flow @xcite .",
    "the `` type s '' thermocouples of the sample carriers were calibrated at the melting points of zn and au , and at the phase transition point of baco@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "degassing of the samples and the chamber was performed under vacuum of approximately @xmath17 mbar for a few hours prior to each experiment , a precautionary measure to purge the chamber and samples of oxygen and humidity , which are particularly present in bif@xmath0 .",

    "platinum parts , however , showed signs of corrosion after prolongued use .",
    "samples in the entire composition range , 0100% bif@xmath0 , were measured by dta , in steps of 5% ; they were of approximately 50 mg .",
    "most of the measurements were performed with a thermal rate of 10k / min ; further measurements with selected samples were performed with 2k / min in order to resolve overlapping peaks .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction measurements of larger samples ( @xmath18 mg ) were made in a general electric xrd 3003tt diffractometer of bragg - brentano geometry using cu k@xmath19 radiation .",

    "this temperature corroborates some of the literature @xcite , though it differs from the value given by the producer alfa aesar , 727@xmath20c .",
    "it is remarkable that this value is almost identical with the @xmath19-to-@xmath21 transition of bi@xmath15o@xmath0 that has a high transformation heat of 29.8kj / mol @xcite .",

    "an intense transition was observed at approximately 415@xmath20c in almost all compositions ( peak  ii ) . by visual inspection of samples that were cooled after passing peak  ii it became obvious that it is due to melting of a major part of the sample .",
    "another transition ( peak  iii ) was detected at ca .",
    "the separation of both peaks  ii and iii was only possible at slower heating rates of 2k / min ; at 10k / min both peaks were overlapping .",

    "the first sample was cooled from this temperature with a rate of 10k / min and its diffraction pattern yielded nothing but the components of the system , lif and bif@xmath0 , despite obvious signs of melting .",
    "segregation of the components in the sample was visible to the eye , due to differing coloration , with lif ( which is white ) concentrated on top , and bif@xmath0 ( grey ) on the bottom of the crucible .",
    "this is surprising , as the formation of the intermediate compound bilif@xmath2 was expected .",
    "the second sample was cooled from 475@xmath35c at a considerably slower thermal rate of 2k / min and yielded an unknown phase .",

    "one can conclude that clearly an intermediate phase made of lif and bif@xmath0 formed that has no scheelite structure . from the current data it was impossible to relate the measured pattern to a crystal structure .",
    "nevertheless polymorphism of the compound bilif@xmath2 seems a realistic assumption , because e.g. the scheelites ylif@xmath2 @xcite and lulif@xmath2 @xcite become monoclinic at high pressure .",
    "@xcite performed czochralski growth with scheelite ylif@xmath2 seeds .",
