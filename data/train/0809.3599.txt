    "extrasolar planets are common ; over 300 systems have been discovered ( e.g. , exoplanet.eu ) .",
    "recent studies have targeted higher mass @xcite , lower mass @xcite , and younger objects @xcite .",
    "identifying young planets is important to define the time scale for planet formation and thus distinguish the possible formation process(es ) .",
    "young stars still surrounded by the circumstellar material which forms planets are typically located at distances of @xmath2100  pc and are thus inherently faint and often obscured .",
    "they also manifest strong magnetic activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are highly spotted .",
    "numerous , large spots complicate detection of extrasolar planets through radial velocity ( rv ) monitoring @xcite because a spot that is partially visible at all times on the surface of an inclined star mimics rv modulation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite studied 12@xmath3300  myr old nearby stars and found no evidence for planets with masses @xmath21@xmath32  m@xmath1 at the 3  @xmath4 level .",
    "@xcite identified a minimum mass 6.1  m@xmath1 planet in a 852  day period orbit around the 100  myr old g1@xmath3g1.5  v star hd  70573 .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported a @xmath010  m@xmath1 planet in a 3.56 day orbit around the 10  myr old star tw hya , although @xcite identify this result as attributable to spots .",
    "in this letter we present our observations of the young stars dn tau , v836 tau , and v827 tau .",
    "while the v827 tau visible light data clearly implicate spots as the cause of the apparent rv variability , corresponding data for dn tau and v836 tau suggest the presence of giant planets .",
    "our infrared ( ir ) observations show that spots cause the rv variations seen in all three stars . in ",
    "2 we describe the observations , in  3 present our data analysis and the evidence for spots , and in  4 provide a brief discussion .",
    "we summarize in  5 .",
    "visible light spectra of dn tau ( m0 ) , v836 tau ( k7 ) , and v827 tau ( k7 ) were taken at the mcdonald obervatory 2.7  meter harlan j. smith telescope , between november , 2004 and january , 2008 , with the coud echelle spectrograph @xcite .",
    "a 1.2@xmath5 slit yielded r@xmath060,000 .",
    "integration times were @xmath01800  s ; average seeing was @xmath02@xmath5 .",
    "thar exposures taken immediately before and after each spectrum provided wavelength calibration ; typical rms values for the dispersion solution precision were @xmath04  m  s@xmath6 .",
    "rv standards @xcite were observed on every night of every run ; their overall rms scatter is 140  m  s@xmath6 .",
    "we obtained 43 spectra of dn tau , 21 of v836 tau , and 20 of v827 tau and applied standard iraf reduction routines .",
    "details are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we observed dn tau , v836 tau , v827 tau , and the rv standards hd 65277 ( k5 ) and gj  281 ( m0 ) on ut 2008 february 13@xmath320 with cshell @xcite , the high - resolution , ir spectrograph at the nasa irtf 3-m telescope .",
    "the seeing was 0.4@xmath30.8@xmath5 .",
    "each object was observed on 6@xmath38 nights .",
    "the 0.5@xmath5 slit yielded r@xmath046,000 .",
    "we obtained data in 10@xmath5 nodded pairs .",
    "spectra were centered at 2.298  @xmath7 m",
    "( vacuum ) .",
    "integration times were @xmath01 hour for the t  tauri stars and @xmath08 minutes for the standards .",
    "the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) was @xmath070@xmath3120 .",
    "data were reduced as described in @xcite .",
    "relative rvs were determined by cross correlating a high snr , fiducial spectrum against all other spectra for the same target .",
    "we used six orders spanning @xmath05700    to 6800   .",
    "uncertainties were estimated from the standard deviation of the mean for the 6 orders , added in quadrature with the 140  m  s@xmath6 uncertainty derived from the rv standards (  2 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "rvs were corrected for the earth s barycentric motion .",
    "optimum periods and uncertainties for phasing the rv data were selected based on power spectra @xcite .",
    "for dn tau we found p@xmath86.33  @xmath90.20 days and a false alarm probability ( fap ) of @xmath100.001 , for v836 tau , p@xmath82.48  @xmath90.49 days and fap@xmath80.10 , and for v827 tau , p@xmath83.76  @xmath90.06 days and fap@xmath110.001 .",
    "we also checked for periodicity using the discrete fourier transform plus clean method of roberts et al .",
    "the strongest power spectrum peaks for dn tau and v836 tau occur at the same periods .",
    "the clean method recovered a best period of 3.61 d for v827 tau , within @xmath02  @xmath4 of the above estimate .",
    "the phased rv data are shown in figures 1@xmath33 .",
    "the presence of a starspot will distort the line profile at the rv that corresponds to the stellar velocity at the location of the spot .",
    "this distortion is in proportion to the ratio of quiescent photosphere surface brightness and surface brightness within the spot , at the observing wavelength , and the fraction of stellar surface covered by the spot ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , asymmetries in the line profiles originating from spots will be present for all lines in the spectrum of a young star and are typically correlated with the rv measured from the same spectrum .",
    "these asymmetries have become the standard criterion for rejecting starspots as the cause of false rv signals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for each of the six orders used to determine the rvs , we cross - correlated all absorption lines and measured the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) for that order .",
    "the average of these six ccfs was used to measure the bisector spans ( lower panels of figures 1@xmath33 ) .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient and associated fap @xcite is listed in the captions . as expected for a spotted star , a clear correlation between bisector span and rv is observed for v827 tau .",
    "dn tau and v836 tau show no correlation , suggesting that the variability is not the result of spots .",
    "the contrast between a 4000  k photosphere and a 3000  k spot @xcite is greater in visible than in ir light because flux scales as a steeper function of temperature at wavelengths shorter than the black body peak ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the decreased spot to photosphere contrast in the near - ir , the amplitude of the rv modulation will be smaller .",
    "conversely , if a planet drives the rv modulation , the amplitude should be the same in visible and ir light .",
    "@xcite used near - ir observations to search for companions to low - mass objects , exploiting telluric absorption lines for high - precision rv measurements .",
    "figure 4 shows an example of a gj  281 k - band spectrum and illustrates our similar approach .",
    "we created models by combining high resolution telluric absorption @xcite and cool stellar spectra ( the sunspot atlas of wallace & livingston 1992 ) , applying a range of velocity shifts relative to the telluric lines .",
    "other free parameters are @xmath12sin@xmath13 , a gaussian fwhm for the spectrometer line spread function , scale factors for line depths , and a first order continuum normalization function .",
    "we employed the marquardt method for non - linear least squares fitting @xcite of each model to an observed spectrum .",
    "the difference between the stellar and telluric velocities in the best fit model spectrum yields the rv , which was then corrected for barycentric motion .",
    "figures 1@xmath33 show the ir - derived relative rvs .",
    "the data are phased to the periods given in  3.1 .",
    "the rv standard deviation in the ir data for hd  65277 is 127  m  s@xmath6 and for gj  281 is 98  m  s@xmath6 .",
    "internal errors , measured from the least squares fitting , are @xmath040  m  s@xmath6 for both standards .",
    "for the young stars , internal errors were 100@xmath3300  m  s@xmath6 , depending on the snr achieved . random errors , which we assume add in quadrature with our internal errors to give the overall scatter in velocities , are 120  m  s@xmath6 for hd  65277 and 90  m  s@xmath6 for gj  281 .",
    "we use 110  m  s@xmath6 as our final value for the random errors .",
    "the uncertainties shown for the ir data in figures 1@xmath33 represent the sum , in quadrature , of the individual internal error and the 110  m  s@xmath6 random error . within our measurement precision , we are unable to detect any ir rv variability in dn tau and v836 tau .",
    "v827 tau shows significant ir rv variations but at a reduced amplitude from those observed in visible light .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the visible light rv modulation for dn tau and v836 tau , with full amplitudes of @xmath14 and @xmath15  m  s@xmath6 , respectively . within the 1  @xmath4 uncertainties , all but one point in the ir rvs of dn tau are consistent with zero ; all six ir rvs of v836 tau also show no variation .",
    "these results indicate that no planets are present around dn tau or v836 tau with masses greater than a few m@xmath1 at @xmath110.5  au or @xmath010  m@xmath1 at @xmath01  au , despite the absence of a correlation between the visible light rvs and bisector spans .",
    "@xcite identify v836 tau and v827 tau as rv variables with peak - to - peak amplitudes of 7@xmath38  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "apparently the density and size of spots on v836 tau vary ; historical data may serve as an additional criterion for heavily spotted young stars .",
    "the primary conclusion from our visible light data is that the lack of a correlation between the line bisector span and the rv is not proof of a reflex motion companion .",
    "in addition , the rv period can change significantly with new data .",
    "initial analysis of 20 visible light rvs for dn tau , taken over 2.5 years , indicated convincing modulation with p@xmath87.5 days and fap@xmath80.002 .",
    "although not markedly different from rotation period estimates of 6.0@xmath36.4 days @xcite , @xmath16 for p@xmath87.5 days was more favorable than that for a secondary peak at 6.3 days . removing the fit to either the 7.5 or 6.3 day period from the rv data and recalculating the power spectrum yielded no significant peak , suggesting that the data were best represented with only one period . with the addition of rvs measured in winter 2007@xmath32008 ,",
    "the integrity of the 7.5 day period was diminished and the 6.3 day period came to dominate the power spectrum .",
    "the rotation period of v836 tau has been stable for decades at 6.76 days @xcite .",
    "we find a different rv period , 2.48 days , and substantially reduced power in the rv modulation near 6.76 days .",
    "the rv period for v827 tau , 3.76 days , is indistinguishable from previously determined values of the rotation period @xcite .",
    "if the visible light rv modulation originates in spots , why do nt the bisector spans correlate ( figures 1 and 2 ) ?",
    "figure 3 clearly shows correlation for v827 tau ; many other stars show a correlation as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do not believe that this can be attributed to a stronger impact of spots on particular spectral lines because the same echelle orders were used to determine the bisector spans for all targets .",
    "@xcite show that when @xmath12sin@xmath13 is smaller than the spectrometer resolution , rv and bisector variations originating in spots can mimic the behavior expected from short period giant planets .",
    "the @xmath12sin@xmath13 of dn tau and v836 tau , @xmath010  km  s@xmath6 , are not much larger than our visible light spectral resolution , 5  km  s@xmath6 , while v827 tau and lkca 19 ( huerta et al .",
    "2008 ) have @xmath12sin@xmath13 values of @xmath020  km  s@xmath6 , suggesting qualitative agreement with the simulations of @xcite .",
    "we have measured the rvs of the @xmath02  myr old t  tauri stars dn  tau , v836  tau , and v827  tau in visible and ir light ; the variations we see in all three systems are likely the result of starspots . furthermore : ( 1 ) periodogram analysis can reveal the presence of a period but not necessarily a reliable value until rv measurements densely sample the full phase of the periodic signal .",
    "( 2 ) the lack of correlation of line bisector spans with rvs for some stars with spots is an important problem to address in the search for planets around young stars .",
    "( 3 ) high - resolution , ir spectroscopy is critical for the verification of young planet candidates ; without the contrast in rv modulation amplitude between the visible light and ir data , it is unclear whether spots or a companion cause variability . ( 4 ) in the case of the spotted young star ,",
    "v827 tau ( figure 3 ) , we observe a substantial reduction in rv amplitude between the visible light and ir data .",
    "this result can be exploited to improve our understanding of starspot temperature and filling factors .",
    "( 5 ) t  tauri stars are virtually guaranteed to have spots at some level ; if planets are also present , their detection will likely require disentanglement of the blended rv signals and will benefit greatly from measurements that span a broad range in wavelength .",

    "we thank g. blake , c. salyk , and e. schaller for sharing keck time ( our first attempt at ir observations of dn tau ) , d. gies and a. fullerton for their assistance implementing the clean power spectrum estimate , and the referee , j. eisloeffel , for a prompt and helpful report .",
