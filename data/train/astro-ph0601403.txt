    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) for elliptical ( e ) and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies is a key scaling relation , which relates the effective radii , the mean surface brightnesses and the velocity dispersions in a relation linear in log - space ( e.g. , dressler et al .  1987 ;",

    "1996 , hereafter jfk1996 ) .",
    "the fp can be interpreted as a relation between the galaxy masses and their mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratios .",
    "for low redshift cluster galaxies the fp has very low internal scatter , e.g.  jfk1996 .",
    "it is therefore a powerful tool for studying the evolution of the m / l ratio as a function of redshift ( e.g. , jrgensen et al .",

    "these authors all find that the fp at @xmath9=0.21.0 is consistent with passive evolution of the stellar populations of the galaxies , generally with a formation redshift @xmath10 .",
    "most previous studies of the fp at @xmath9=0.21.0 cover fairly small samples of galaxies in each cluster and are limited to a narrow range in luminosities and therefore in masses , making it very difficult to detect possible differences in the fp slope .",
    "a few recent studies indicated a steepening of the fp slope for @xmath11 galaxies ( di serego alighieri et al .",
    "2005 ; van der wel et al .  2005 ; holden et al .",
    "these studies and studies of the k - band luminosity function ( toft et al .",
    "2004 ) and the red sequence ( de lucia et al .",
    "2004 ) at @xmath12 suggest a mass dependency of the formation epoch .",
    "we present the fp for two galaxy clusters rxj0152.71357 at @xmath0 and rxj1226.9 + 3332 at @xmath1 .",
    "our samples reach apparent @xmath13-band magnitudes of 22.522.8 mag , equivalent to an absolute magnitude of @xmath14 in the rest frame of the clusters .",
    "no other published samples suitable for studies of the cluster galaxy fp at @xmath15 go this deep .",
    "our study of these two clusters is part of the gemini / hst galaxy cluster project , which is described in detail in jrgensen et al .",

    "the data for rxj0152.71357 are published in jrgensen et al .",
    "the reduction of the rxj1226.9 + 3332 spectroscopy was done using similar techniques , with suitable changes to take into account the use of the nod - and - shuffle mode of gmos - n ( jrgensen et al .  in prep . ) .",

    "the combination which enters the fp , @xmath24 ( @xmath250.7 - 0.8 ) , differs very little for the two choices of profiles . in the following we use the parameters from @xmath23-fits for consistency with our low redshift comparison data .",

    "we find @xmath29 where @xmath20 is the the effective radius in kpc , @xmath30 the velocity dispersion in @xmath27 , and @xmath31 is the surface brightness within @xmath20 in @xmath32 .",

    "figure [ fig - fp ] shows the coma cluster fp face - on as well as two edge - on views of the relation , with the high redshift sample overplotted .",
    "the fp for the high redshift sample is not only offset from the coma cluster fp , but appears `` steeper '' . as there is no significant fp zero point difference between the two high redshift clusters we treat the high redshift galaxies as one sample .",

    "the fit to the coma sample , excluding the low mass galaxies , gives @xmath38 with an rms of 0.09 in @xmath39 .",
    "fitting the high redshift sample , using the same mass limit , gives @xmath40 with an rms of 0.14 in @xmath39 .",
    "the internal scatter in @xmath41 of the two relations are not significantly different .",
    "we find 0.07 and 0.08 for the coma sample and the high redshift sample , respectively .",
    "even with the same mass limit enforced on both samples one might argue that the fits are still affected by the difference in the luminosity limit .",
    "therefore , we also fit a sub - sample of the coma sample limited at @xmath42 .",
    "the coefficient for @xmath43 is in this case @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the difference between the coefficients for the high redshift and the low redshift samples is at the @xmath37 level .",
    "to test how well we recover input @xmath20 , @xmath31 and @xmath45 ( @xmath460.7 - 0.8 ) , we simulate hst / acs observations of galaxies with srsic profiles with @xmath47 and effective parameters matching our coma sample . for @xmath48 , the @xmath23-fits recover @xmath33 with an rms of 0.15 .",
    "however , @xmath45 is recovered with an rms scatter of only @xmath49 for @xmath50 between 0.7 and 0.8 .",
    "there are no systematic effects as a function of effective radii or luminosities , see chiboucas et al .",
    "( in prep . ) for details",
    ". simulations of spectra matching the instrumental resolution , signal - to - noise ratios and spectral properties of our observational data showed that velocity dispersions below the instrumental resolution ( @xmath51 ) may be subject to systematic errors as large as @xmath52 in @xmath35 ( jrgensen et al .",
    "excluding from the analysis the four galaxies in the high redshift sample with @xmath53 , we find a slope for the m / l ratio  mass relation of @xmath54 , while the fp coefficients are not significantly different from those given in eq .",
    "[ eq - highz ] .    finally , we address whether selection effects can be the cause of the differences in the relations for the two samples .",
    "we choose 1000 random sub - samples of 38 galaxies from the coma sample , roughly matching the mass distribution of the high redshift sample .",
    "we confirm the match in mass distributions by using a kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "the probability that the sub - samples and the real high redshift sample are drawn from the same parent distribution is above 90% for more than 90% of the realizations . for the remainder",
    "the probability is above 70% .",
    "we then compare the fits to these sub - samples to the results from bootstrapping the high redshift sample .",
    "for the fp coefficients the sub - sample fits overlap the bootstrap fits in only 1.6% of the cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig - sim]a ) , while for the m / l ratio  mass relation the slope for the sub - samples overlap with the bootstrap fits in 3.7% of the cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig - sim]b ) .",
    "this shows that the fp and the m / l ratio  mass relation for the high redshift sample are different from the relations found for the coma sample at the 9698% confidence level .",
    "based on the simulations of the data and the selection effects , we conclude that the differences in relations we find between the coma sample and the high redshift sample are unlikely to be due to systematic effects in the data or due to differences in selection effects .",
    "the median offset of @xmath41 for the high redshift sample relative to the coma sample is 0.38 . using stellar population models from maraston ( 2005 ) , which show that @xmath55 ( jrgensen et al .",
    "2005 ) , this gives an epoch for the last major star formation episode of @xmath56 .",
    "however , the steeper m / l ratio ",
    "mass relation found for high redshift clusters compared to the coma cluster may be due to a difference in the epoch of the last major star formation episode as a function of galaxy mass .",
    "the low mass galaxies have experienced the last major star formation episode much more recently than is the case for the high mass galaxies .",
    "the difference between the high and low redshift samples is @xmath57 , equivalent to @xmath58 .",
    "thus , for the lowest mass galaxies ( @xmath5 ) the last epoch of star formation may have been as recent as @xmath59 .",
    "this is only @xmath601.5 gyr prior to when the light that we now observe was emitted from the galaxies in the high redshift sample .",
    "there appears to be just enough time for the galaxies to no longer have detectable emission lines due to the massive stars formed at that time .",
    "very shortly after the end of the last major star formation episode these galaxies follow a tight fp . for galaxies with @xmath61",
    "we find @xmath62 , while @xmath63 for galaxies with @xmath64 .",
    "thomas et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used absorption line index data for nearby e / s0 galaxies to establish rough star formation histories of the galaxies as a function of their masses .",
    "they find that the most massive galaxies form the majority of their stars at high redshift , while lower mass galaxies continue forming stars at much later epochs .",
    "thomas et al .",
    "convert velocity dispersions to galaxy masses using a model dependent relation that is inconsistent with our data .",
    "we therefore correct their masses to consistency with our data by using the empirical relation between our mass estimates and the measured velocity dispersions .",
    "the lower of the two dashed green lines on figure [ fig - fp]d shows the result based on the star formation history in high density environments as established by thomas et al .  and",
    "the m / l modeling from maraston ( 2005 ) .",
    "our data show slightly less evolution in the m / l ratios between @xmath650.8 - 0.9 and the present than predicted by thomas et al .",
    "however , it is striking that the slope of the predicted relation is in agreement with our data . as an experiment we shifted the predictions from thomas et al .  to the best agreement with our data .",
    "the upper of the two dashed green lines show this for the formation look back times shifted 2.5 gyr earlier for all masses such that the earliest formation look back time is 14 gyr ( roughly the age of the universe in this cosmology ) .",
    "the absolute formation epochs from thomas et al .  may not be correct , since their analysis depends on stellar population models . however , their results on the relative timing of the star formation episodes as a function of galaxy mass closely match our results for this high redshift sample .",
    "thomas et al .  predict that star formation is on - going for a longer period in low mass galaxies than in high mass galaxies .",
    "based on this , we estimate that the internal scatter in the m / l  mass relation , in @xmath41 , should be @xmath66 at @xmath5 but only @xmath67 at @xmath7 .",
    "we can not confirm such a decrease of the internal scatter .",
    "however , it would most likely require a larger sample and/or significantly smaller measurement uncertainties to test this prediction .",
    "factors other than the mean ages of the stellar populations could be affecting the m / l ratios of the galaxies . for rxj0152.71357 we found based on absorption line index data that a large fraction of the galaxies may have @xmath68-element abundance ratios , @xmath69 $ ] , about 0.2 dex higher than found in nearby clusters ( jrgensen et al .",

    "we find that the fp for e / s0 galaxies in the clusters rxj0152.71357 ( @xmath0 ) and rxj1226.9 + 3332 ( @xmath1 ) is offset and rotated relative to the fp of our low redshift comparison sample of coma cluster galaxies",
    ". expressed as a relation between the m / l ratios and the masses of the galaxies , the high redshift galaxies follow a significantly steeper relation than found for the coma cluster .",
    "we interpret this as due to a mass dependency of the epoch of the last major star formation episode .",
    "the lowest mass galaxies in the sample ( @xmath5 ) have experienced significant star formation as recent as @xmath59 , while high mass galaxies ( @xmath64 ) have @xmath63 .",
