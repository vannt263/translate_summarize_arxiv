    "in recent years , the investigation of the spin structure of the nucleon by using deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering ( dis ) experiments has been an exciting and controversial field in hadron physics .",
    "the experiments performed by emc , smc at cern @xcite , and e142 , e143 at slac @xcite provide direct information on the matrix elements of spin - dependent operators in the nucleon .",
    "the spin - dependent dis cross section is determined by the antisymmetric part of the hadronic tensor @xmath10g_2(x , q^2)\\ } \\eqno ( 1)\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the four vectors of the nucleon and virtual photon momentums . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are two spin - dependent structure functions for the bjorken variable @xmath15 with @xmath16 is the transfered four momentum squared and @xmath17 is the covariant spin vector of the nucleon .    according to operator product expansion ( ope ) analysis , to order @xmath18 , the lowest two moments of @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be written ( qcd radiative corrections are not included ) @xcite @xmath19 \\eqno(2a)\\ ] ] @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 depend on the nucleon forward matrix elements of twist-2 , twist-3 and twist-4 operators respectively .",
    "for example @xmath26 @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) are axial charges defined by the above axial - vectorial matrix elements .",
    "the singlet axial charge is proportional to the total quark helicity @xmath29 in the nucleon . using the semileptonic weak decay data ,",
    "which are related to nonsinglet axial charges , the 1988 emc result seemed to indicate that @xmath30 is surprisingly small and led to so - called `` spin crisis '' .",
    "since then , an intensive study of @xmath31 has been conducted .",
    "the efforts both from experimental and theoretical works led to a deeper understanding of internal spin structure of the nucleon , although many questions remain .",
    "the most recent reviews on this subject can be found in @xcite . neglecting the terms of order @xmath18 in eqs.(2a - d ) , the longitudinal polarized structure function @xmath13 receives only twist-2 contributions . on the other hand ,",
    "the structure function @xmath14 contains not only twist-2 but also twist-3 contributions corresponding to the matirx element @xmath32 .",
    "the twist-3 contributions coming from spin - dependent quark gluon correlations do not vanish even in the large @xmath33 limit @xcite .    to separate the twist-2 and twist-3 contributions of @xmath14 ,",
    "one can write ( wandzura - wilczek@xcite ) @xmath34 where the twist-2 piece ( see , however , discussion in section iii ) is @xmath35 and the twist-3 piece is @xmath36 it is easy to check that , to order o(@xmath37 , we have @xmath38 @xmath39 hence the twist-2 and twist-3 contributions of @xmath14 are separated .",
    "measuring @xmath13 and @xmath14 as functions of @xmath40 and @xmath33 , one can obtain @xmath41 , @xmath42 and their third and even higher moments . up to order @xmath18 , @xmath14 uniquely measures the twist-3 contributions without involving any model - dependent analysis .",
    "hence @xmath43 provides more detailed information about nucleon structure than does @xmath31 .",
    "very recently , a preliminary experimental result of @xmath43 has been published @xcite and more precise data obtained by e143 experiment @xcite at slac should be published soon . since @xmath43 was discussed only briefly in a previous paper @xcite , it is appropriate to give a detailed analysis in the modified center - of - mass ( cm ) bag model , using newly obtained data on @xmath43 . in section",
    "ii , the cm bag model is briefly reviewed and the results for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and their moments @xmath23 , @xmath24 are presented . discussion and comparison with most recent data and other model results",
    "are given in section iii .",
    "a brief summary is given in section iv .",
    "as mentioned in a previous paper @xcite , the bag model does not contain gluon fields explicitly , but the boundary of the bag - confined quarks simulates the binding effect coming from quark - gluon and gluon - gluon interactions ( the gluon contribution to the proton spin in the bag model has been discussed by jaffe @xcite recently ) .",
    "hence , the structure function @xmath43 calculated in the bag model does include higher twist effects .",
    "we have reported the cm bag model results @xcite for the unpolarized and polarized structure functions @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath31 , and briefly for @xmath43 . in this paper",
    ", we will focus our attention on @xmath43 . for reader s convenience , we give a brief review for cm bag model calculation of the structure functions .",
    "one needs to calculate the hadron tensor @xmath46|p , s>\\ ] ] and separate the antisymmetric part to obtain @xmath47 which can be expressed in general as @xmath48 in the bjorken limit , where @xmath49 depends on the model of the nucleon and the approximations used in the calculation .",
    "the basic assumptions and approximations of the cm bag model are : ( i ) the nucleon electromagnetic current @xmath50 ( or @xmath51nn vertex , see ( 2.7 ) in @xcite ) , can be approximately expressed by incoherent sum of single quark electromagnetic currents .",
    "it implies that the virtual photon interacts with only one quark at a time and the other two quarks are spectators ; this is an impulse approximation .",
    "the current includes not only the contribution of the struck quark but also those of the spectator quarks . since the current satisfies translational invariance , four momentum is conserved .",
    "( ii ) the nucleon consists of three valence quarks in their @xmath52-wave state ; higher excited states and higher fock states which include gluons and sea quark pairs in addition to three valence quarks are neglected .",
    "( iii ) su(3)@xmath53su(2)@xmath54 wave functions for the proton and neutron are used .",
    "symmetry - breaking effect is described in terms of a parameter @xmath55 , which simulates the smaller spatial size for the scalar @xmath56 quark pair than that for the vector @xmath57 and @xmath58 quark pairs in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the effect of quark confinement due to nonperturbative quark - gluon and gluon - gluon interactions is described in terms of bound - state quark spatial wave functions , for instance the quark bag wave function in the cavity approximation in the mit bag model or gaussian - type quark wave function used in some other models .",
    "all necessary formulae for the cm bag model calculation can be found in @xcite .",
    "a formal and general discussion on the theoretical basis of the cm bag model has been given in @xcite .",
    "we note that in addition to the cm bag model calculation , the transverse spin structure functions @xmath43 has also been computed in the original mit bag model by jaffe and ji @xcite , and other modified versions of the mit bag model by schreiber , signal and thomas ( sst bag model @xcite ) , and by stratmann ( mod model @xcite ) .",
    "experimentally , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are measured by combining two different cases of deep inelastic scattering of polarized leptons on polarized nucleons : ( i ) the beam and target spin orientations are parallel , and ( ii ) the beam and target spin orientations are perpendicular . experimentally , @xmath59 can be calculated from various models of the nucleon . in this case",
    "it is convenient to choose suitable projection operators to extract @xmath31 and @xmath43 from model results of @xmath49 .",
    "one of possible projections is to extract @xmath60 and @xmath61 by choosing the nucleon spin parallel ( ` l ' ) or perpendicular ( ` t ' ) to the virtual photon momentum as we did in @xcite . it should be noted that it is not necessary to choose the same projection as those used in the experimental analysis .",
    "several parameters have been used in the cm bag model calculation .",
    "they are : ( a ) ` bag ' radius r=5 gev@xmath62 , ( b ) su(3 ) symmetry breaking parameter @xmath63 and ( c ) maximum momentum of quarks inside the nucleon @xmath64 gev / c .",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 were determined from the fit of the @xmath67 radius of the neutron and proton , and the ratio @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "the model with these two parameters gives a fairly good result for the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon and the magnetic moments of octet baryons .",
    "in particular , the neutron charge form factor is well reproduced . for the dis",
    "parton distributions , the third parameter @xmath69",
    "gev / c has been introduced .",
    "it constrains the unpolarized valence quark distributions to satisfy the sum rules @xmath70 as mentioned in @xcite , to compare the model results with data , the qcd evolution technique has to be used to evolve the parton distributions from the renormalization scale @xmath71 to higher @xmath33 where the experiments are performed .",
    "we choose @xmath71=0.81 ( gev / c)@xmath72 and qcd scale parameter @xmath73=0.3 ( gev / c ) .",
    "the cm bag model with these parameters gives a good description for both unpolarized and polarized structure functions at @xmath74 , where the valence quark contributions dominate . for small-@xmath40 region , @xmath75 ,",
    "the sea quark contributions are necessary . using some qcd inspired phenomenological sea distributions ( see ( 4.19 ) in @xcite )",
    ", we found that the first moment of @xmath76 is consistent with the experimental value and the first moment of @xmath77 satisfies the bjorken sum rule .",
    "for the higher moments ( @xmath78 ) , the sea contributions coming mainly from the small @xmath40 region are highly suppressed by the factor @xmath79 and are thus less important .",
    "hence we neglect possible sea contributions for the higher moments of @xmath43 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    for qcd evolution of the structure function @xmath31 and twist-2 piece @xmath80 from @xmath71 to @xmath82 , the ordinary altarelli - parisi equations @xcite can be used . for twist-3 part of @xmath43 ,",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that due to mixing of twist-3 quark operators and quark - gluon operators with same twist and quantum numbers , the number of independent operators contributing to @xmath81 increases with @xmath83 , where @xmath83 refers to the @xmath83-th moment .",
    "it implies that one can not write down an altarelli - parisi type evolution equation for @xmath43 .",
    "this feature has been confirmed by several later calculations in @xcite and most recently in @xcite .",
    "hence there is no simple evolution equation for @xmath43 in the general case .",
    "one has to look for some approximate solutions .",
    "two approximate evolution approaches under the limits @xmath84 or power @xmath85 were suggested by ali , braun and hiller @xcite .",
    "we use the approach in the large @xmath86 limit rather than the approximation in the large @xmath83 limit , which only provides the asymptotic behavior of @xmath14 in the region @xmath87 .",
    "we also note that as far as the third moments @xmath88 are concerned , the @xmath33 evolution is straightforward , i.e. a single power behavior of @xmath89 ( for instance see @xcite ) .    in fig.1@xmath905 , we present the results of @xmath76 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ( which is determined by @xmath76 ) , and @xmath94 respectively . for the deuteron target , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "all theoretical curves are calculated in the cm bag model at @xmath71=0.81 ( gev / c)@xmath72 and evolved to @xmath33=5.0 ( gev / c)@xmath72 except for fig . 4 and fig . 6 , where @xmath33=4.0 ( gev / c)@xmath72 and @xmath33=3.0 ( gev / c)@xmath72 respectively . comparisons of our results for the third moments of @xmath31 and @xmath43 with recent data and other model predictions are listed in tables i , ii and iii .",
    "the data for @xmath31 are taken from @xcite and those for @xmath43 are taken from @xcite .",
    "* 1*. for the leading term of first moments of @xmath0 , we obtain @xmath98 which can be compared with smc data @xcite at @xmath99=5 ( gev / c)@xmath72 : @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and e143 data @xcite at @xmath99=3 ( gev / c)@xmath72 : @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "* 2*. for the leading term of third moments of @xmath0 , we get @xmath106 while preliminary data at @xmath99=5 ( gev / c)@xmath72 @xcite show : @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "comparisons with other models are listed in tables i and iii .",
    "we note that no @xmath109 data are available yet .",
    "* 3*. since @xmath76 is always positive in the range @xmath110 , hence @xmath111 must be positive . from eq.(2c ) , the leading term of @xmath111 , i.e. @xmath112 must also be positive as shown in eq.(9 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath113 as function of @xmath40 is mostly negative except for large @xmath40 region , where @xmath113 is positive but very small .",
    "hence its third moment , or @xmath114 , is negative . for the deuteron ,",
    "since the positive contribution from the proton is larger than the negative contribution from the neutron in the @xmath115 , hence our model predicts a positive @xmath116 as shown in eq.(9 ) and table iii .    * 4*. as mentioned in section i , in the ope approach including twist-2 and twist-3 operators in the presence of qcd corrections , the burkhardt - cottingham @xcite sum rule @xmath4 is known to hold .",
    "the cm bag model predicts @xmath117 comparing to the numerical values for @xmath118 in eq.(8 ) , they are numerically consistent with zero . hence in our model ,",
    "the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule is satisfied within numerical errors .",
    "most recent data @xcite give @xmath119 which are consistent with zero . it should be noted that in the mit bag model with su(6 ) symmetry , @xmath120 is identically zero by itself . however , the cm bag model with su(6 ) symmetry breaking effects ( @xmath121 ) predicts a nonzero @xmath120 .    *",
    "5*. since @xmath1 is not identically zero in the model , the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule implies that @xmath1 must change its sign at some @xmath122 , where @xmath123 , _ i.e. _ @xmath1 must have at least one non - trivial zero .",
    "the question is whether the @xmath40-behavior of @xmath43 satisfies @xmath124 or just opposite @xmath125 for case 1 , one has @xmath126 , while for case 2 , @xmath127 .",
    "the cm bag model predictions for @xmath128 are all negative ( see table i , ii and iii or fig.3 and fig.7 ) .",
    "this implies the @xmath40-behavior of @xmath1 fits case 2 . the preliminary data @xcite seem to favor our predictions ( see , for instance , fig.2 for the proton ) .",
    "* 6*. for both the proton and deuteron , we now have @xmath129 and @xmath130 . in the cm bag model , the moment @xmath7 ( @xmath131/3 $ ] ) is about one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath8 ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "it implies @xmath133 ( recall @xmath134 ) , or @xmath135 .",
    "hence the twist-3 matrix element @xmath136 approximately equals to the twist-2 matrix element @xmath137 and the sign of @xmath136 should also be positive for the proton and deuteron targets .",
    "this agrees with data @xcite but disagree with the negative sign predicted by the qcd sum rules @xcite and quenched lattice qcd@xcite .    for the neutron ,",
    "since @xmath138 is negative and much larger than @xmath139 in magnitude , hence @xmath140 is negative .",
    "this negative sign is consistent with the results given by other approaches @xcite . in magnitude",
    ", our result agrees with that given by the quenched lattice qcd , but much less than those given by the qcd sum rules .    *",
    "7*. our results show @xmath135 , i.e. the twist-3 contribution is almost the same magnitude as twist-2 contribution . from ( 6a ) and ( 6b )",
    ", it implies that the @xmath141 and @xmath3 have opposite sign and approximately same magnitude .",
    "they almost cancel each other and lead to a very small @xmath1 ( see also fig .",
    "12a , b in @xcite ) . for the same reason the original wandzura - wilczek relation @xmath142 is not a good approximation and the higher twist contributions may not be neglected . as pointed by cortes , pire and ralston @xcite that the original wandzura - wilczek relation was derived by using the dirac equation for free and massless quarks .",
    "including quark mass effect and gluon dependent term , an extended wandzura - wilczek relation was given ( similar formula without quark mass term has been given by jaffe @xcite ) : @xmath143 where the mass dependent term is another twist-2 piece which is related to ` transversity ' @xmath144 .",
    "the last term is the ` true ' twist-3 piece arising from quark - gluon correlation . as emphasized in @xcite that when the quark mass term is included the twist-3 term can not be isolated in a model independent way with a measurement of @xmath31 and @xmath43 .",
    "however , neglecting the strange quark contribution , the quark mass term ( @xmath145 ) should be negligible for up and down quarks .",
    "hence the separation of twist-2 and twist-3 pieces in eq.(4 ) seems to be a reasonable approximation .    *",
    "8*. according to the ope analysis , neglecting the @xmath18 corrections , the general formulae for the moments of the structure functions are @xmath146 @xmath147 \\qquad ( n=2,4,6 , ... ) \\eqno ( 11b)\\ ] ] for @xmath148 , they reduced to ( 2c ) and ( 2d ) . from ( 11a ) and ( 11b ) , one obtains @xmath149dx = { 1\\over 2}d^{(n)}(q^2)\\qquad ( n=2,4,6 , ... ) \\eqno ( 12)\\ ] ] hence one has for @xmath148 @xmath150dx \\eqno ( 13)\\ ] ] the cm bag model prediction for the function @xmath151 $ ] for the proton is shown in fig . 9 and that for the deuteron is shown in fig .",
    "one can see that in both cases , the model predictions for @xmath136 are nonzero and positive .",
    "this seems to be consistent with recent data @xcite .    *",
    "9*. if one assumes that ( 12 ) holds also for @xmath152 one obtains @xmath153dx={1\\over 2}d^{(1)}(q^2 ) \\eqno ( 14a)\\ ] ] to lowest order in @xmath154 , it was shown @xcite by using the field theoretical parton model that @xmath155 vanishes in the chiral limit , one has the efremov - leader - teryaev ( elt ) sum rule @xmath153dx=0 \\eqno ( 14b)\\ ] ] however , our results of @xmath31 and @xmath43 do not satisfy this sum rule . to demonstrate this , we plot @xmath156 as functions of @xmath40 in fig.11 and fig . 12 and",
    "compare them with recent proton and deuteron data @xcite respectively .",
    "one can see that our model predictions are consistent with the slac e143 data .",
    "however , the elt sum rule seems not to be supported by the data ( at least for the proton data ) .",
    "the study of transverse spin structure function @xmath14 has both theoretical and experimental interest . in the most naive parton model ,",
    "the quark is asymptotic free and has no transverse momentum , @xmath1 is identically zero .",
    "however , quarks inside the nucleon are not free , the binding effect , which arising from quark - gluon interactions , causes a nonzero transverse momentum for quarks and leads to @xmath157 .",
    "measurements of @xmath43 or @xmath158 allow us to get more information about binding effects , which are mainly formulated as ` higher twist effects ' .",
    "on the other hand , since @xmath33 is large in the deep inelastic scattering , quark binding effects should not be significant and @xmath43 should be small , especially compared to @xmath31 .",
    "this seems to agree with most recent exprimental result @xcite .",
    "our model calculation is consistent with this conclusion .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the theoretical predictions given by different models or approaches seem not to fully agree with each other because of different approximations . in addition , as mentioned in section iii that another twist-2 piece which is related to the quark mass and ` transversity ' @xmath144 has been neglected in our discussion . on the experimental side ,",
    "the errors of data are still quite large .",
    "we hope that several new experiments @xcite to be performed in the next few years will provide more precise data and tell us more about the quark spin ( including longitudinal and transverse ) distributions in the nucleon .",
