    "the paraxial propagation of the field through a distance @xmath5 is described in the phase space as the following simple transformation of the wigner distribution function [ [ bastiaans ] ] : @xmath13 this formula applied to the wigner function of the periodic field gives the following result : @xmath14 \\delta(u - \\frac{n+n'}{2 } u_0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the course of propagation the interference terms acquire additional phase shifts given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the talbot distance .",
    "it is straightforward to see that for integer multiples of the talbot distance the original wigner function of the input field is reproduced .    at intermediate distances ,",
    "the phase shifts @xmath17 play a nontrivial role and the structure of the observed fresnel images becomes more complex .",
    "nevertheless , they exhibit an interesting regular behavior at rational multiples of the talbot distance",
    ". we will now discuss this effect in terms of the wigner distribution function .",
    "let us denote @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are coprime integers .",
    "the main complication in eq .",
    "( [ wxuz ] ) are phase factors @xmath17 which depend quadratically on @xmath21",
    ". we will simplify it with the help of an observation used in the studies of quantum wave packets dynamics [ [ averbukh ] ] : the exponent @xmath22 is periodic in @xmath21 with the period @xmath23 if @xmath20 is a multiple of 4 and @xmath24 otherwise .",
    "the quadratic phase factor can therefore be represented as a finite fourier sum : @xmath25 with certain coefficients @xmath26 , which have been analyzed in detail in ref .",
    "[ [ averbukh ] ] .",
    "substitution of the above expression yields : @xmath27 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\label{wxumztkfinal } \\times \\exp\\left[-\\frac{2\\pi i n'}{a } \\left(x-\\frac{s'a}{l}\\right)\\right ]   \\delta\\left(u - \\frac{n+n'}{2 } u_0\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the interference terms of the wigner function can now be interpreted as generated by pairs of fourier components of the source field shifted in the position space by rational fractions @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "a simple rearrangement of the exponent arguments allows one to represent the sum over @xmath21 and @xmath30 solely in terms of the source field wigner function : @xmath31 w\\left(x-\\frac{(s+s')a}{2l},u;0\\right).\\ ] ] this is a compact summation formula for the wigner function at rational multiples of the talbot distance .",
    "it shows , quite surprisingly , that @xmath32 is simply given by a _ finite _ sum of spatially displaced wigner functions of the source field , with some phase factors .",
    "integration of the derived expression for the wigner function over @xmath3 yields the known formula for the field intensity distribution in the observation plane : @xmath33 which shows that the observed fresnel image can be represented as generated by a finite sum of shifted source field amplitudes [ [ guigay ] ] .",
    "a detailed discussion of fractional talbot images can be found in ref .",
    "[ [ berry ] ] .",
    "we have discussed a one dimensional fresnel diffraction from a periodic grating using the phase space formalism .",
    "we have seen in this picture , that the whole propagation of the field is encoded in the interference terms of the wigner function , generated by coherence between fourier components of the source wave .",
    "the variety of the fresnel images is simply a result of a complicated interplay between phases of these interference terms .",
    "the summation formula derived in this paper demonstrates that the fractional talbot effect can be also understood as an interference between components shifted in the position space by fractions of the pattern period .",
    "let us finally note a close analogy between the talbot effect and the dynamics of various nonlinear quantum systems .",
    "dynamical phase factors with a quadratic dependence on the summation index are a common feature of many problems .",
    "these phase factors can be easily revealed in the equation of motion for the quantum wigner function in the @xmath34 phase space : @xmath35 w_{nn'}(x , p;0),\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are the amplitudes of the initial wave function @xmath37 projected onto the energy eigenstate @xmath38 , and where @xmath39 are the cross wigner functions of the eigenstates . for many systems , their eigenergies @xmath40",
    "are given by a quadratic polynomial of @xmath21 .",
    "this can be either an approximate dependence , as it is for the rydberg electron wave packets [ [ parker ] ] , or a strict one , as it happens for an electromagnetic field mode in the kerr medium [ [ yurke ] ] and a particle in the infinite square well .",
    "in all these cases , the state of the system turns out to be highly regular for times equal to rational multiples of the characteristic revival time , at which the system is again in its initial state .",
    "this regularity consists in a formation of a finite superposition of copies of the initial state generated by a simple transformation . for the wave packets",
    "dynamics , the components are spatially shifted [ [ averbukh ] ] ; for the kerr medium , the components are rotated in the phase space around its origin [ [ tara ] ] .",
    "in particular , a close similarity exists between the talbot effect and the fractional revivals in the infinite square well .",
    "the dynamics of the latter system is equivalent to an evolution in a free space of an infinite periodic sequence of displaced initial wave functions [ [ born],[stifter ] ] .",
    "furthermore , the propagation of electromagnetic fields in the paraxial approximation is governed by the same wave equation as the quantum time evolution .",
    "therefore , fresnel diffraction of classical electromagnetic waves on periodic gratings is a strict counterpart of the quantum dynamics of a confined particle .",
    "the authors have benefited from discussions with j. h. eberly and from a stimulating talk given in ulm by b. rohwedder . this work has been partially supported by the polish kbn grant 2 po3b 006 11 and the deutsche forschungsgemeinshaft ."
