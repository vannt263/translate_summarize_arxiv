    "compass  @xcite is a fixed - target experiment installed on the cern sps m2 beam line .",
    "one of its goals is the unraveling of the spin structure of the nucleon . in this respect ,",
    "it attempts to answer questions left open by the measurements of the double spin asymmetry in inclusive deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering @xmath1 .",
    "first , the gluon distribution @xmath2 remains largely undetermined .",
    "qcd fits of present world data can only but poorly constrain it from the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath1 , for lack of lever arm in @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , inclusive data alone do not allow to separate quark and anti - quark distributions .    in compass",
    ", additional information is brought by semi - inclusive measurements .",
    "these are performed with transverse as well as longitudinal target spin orientations , which allows to investigate also the transversity distribution , _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite .    finally , in the inclusive measurement of @xmath1 , compass reaches unprecedented precision in the low bjorken @xmath4 domain , which will bring improvement in the knowledge of the integral of the @xmath5 structure function .",
    "the compass spectrometer is described in  @xcite .",
    "its experimental setup was designed to allow a precise determination of asymmetries .",
    "thanks to its simultaneous measurement of both orientations of target spin in 2 oppositely polarized target cells , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and to a frequent reversal of spin orientations , the acceptance and incident muon flux cancel out in the formula for the cross - section asymmetry @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the counting rate , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the 2 spin configurations , @xmath13 is the beam polarization ( @xmath1476% ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the @xmath17 target polarization ( @xmath1450% ) and , process dependent , dilution factor ( @xmath1440% ) .",
    "the experiment has accumulated @xmath143  @xmath18 of data in its 3 years of running from 2002 to 2004 .",
    "about half of these data has been analyzed so far .",
    "in compass , we access the gluon distribution via the photon - gluon fusion @xmath19 process , whereby a virtual photon couples to a gluon via a @xmath20 pair .",
    "we consider two different selections of the @xmath19 : open charm and high @xmath21 hadron production . both have been successfully used to directly measure the unpolarized gluon distribution at the hera collider experiments ( with the difference that high @xmath21 refers to the production of jets there ) . for both ,",
    "hard interactions are selected irrespective of @xmath3 , by , respectively , the charm mass and the @xmath21 cut .",
    "but the 2 selections differ largely in terms of statistics ( higher for high @xmath21 ) and background . in the high @xmath21 case , not only do physics background processes contribute significantly but their impact can only be evaluated by a monte carlo modelization of the experiment .",
    "the intricacy of the problem becomes larger at low @xmath3 , where processes involving resolved photons dominate .",
    "therefore , two sub - cases are further considered , _ viz . _ @xmath22 and all @xmath3 .",
    "a determination of @xmath0 has been obtained for the sub - sample with @xmath22 and for the much bigger sample with all @xmath3 only the projection for the precision expected from the 2002 - 2004 data is so far available .",
    "the 2 values are plotted on fig .",
    "[ dg ] and discussed in  @xcite .",
    "for events with open charm production , @xmath19 enters alone at leading order ( in the limit where the nucleon s intrinsic charm is neglected ) .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the combinatorial background associated with their selection by the identification of a @xmath23 meson from its @xmath24 decay .",
    "this is a major concern in compass where the vertex resolution is not sufficient to reconstruct the decay vertex , because of the thickness of the target .",
    "special care is therefore taken to optimize the use of the data .",
    "first , the favorable cases when the @xmath23 comes from a @xmath25 decay are counted separately , _ cf . _",
    "secondly , a weighting procedure is applied for the derivation of @xmath0 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is @xmath19 s analysing power and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the signal and background counting rates . in these conditions ,",
    "the precision is expected to be @xmath30 , with direct and @xmath31-tagged @xmath23 s contributing about equally .",
    "this projection is plotted on fig .",

    "the inclusive @xmath1 is derived from ( [ amun ] ) through @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the depolarization factor from the muon to the virtual photon .",
    "the data selection is actually not literally inclusive : at low @xmath4 a charged hadron is required in the final state , as was done by the smc experiment  @xcite .",
    "this removes the background from elastic and quasi - elastic scattering and allows for the interaction vertex to be unambiguously located in either of the target cells .",
    "the kinematical domain is restricted to @xmath22 and @xmath35 , which makes the measurement cover nearly the same @xmath4 domain as smc .",
    "the results for the 2002 - 2003 data  @xcite are shown in fig .",

    "they significantly improve the accuracy in the region @xmath36 .",
    "at the difference with the inclusive case , semi - inclusive measurements allow to separate quark and anti - quark contributions .",
    "this is possible when two conditions are met .",
    "first , the hard scattering and soft fragmentation processes must be proved to factorize .",
    "secondly , the current fragmentation ( arising from the struck quark ) must be clearly separated from the target one .",
    "one also needs a large enough set of independent measurements in order to get a meaningful flavor separation .",
    "compass intends to compute the following asymmetries : @xmath37 , which , on its deuterium ( isoscalar ) target , gives access to the following combinations : @xmath38 .",
    "the analysis is under way .",
