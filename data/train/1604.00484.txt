    "it is well known that tilting theory is a theoretical basis in the representation theory of finite - dimensional algebras , in which the notion of tilting modules is fundamental . moreover , in the representation theory of algebras the notion of  mutation \" often plays an important role .",

    "happel and unger gave some necessary and sufficient conditions under which mutation of tilting modules is possible ; however , mutation of tilting modules is not always possible . in [ air ] , adachi , iyama and reiten introduced the notion of support @xmath0-tilting modules which generalizes that of tilting modules , and showed that mutation of support @xmath0-tilting modules is always possible .",
    "this is a big advantage of  support @xmath0-tilting mutation \" which  tilting mutation \" does not have . note that the @xmath0-tilting theory developed in [ air ] has stimulated several investigations ; in particular , there is a close relation between support @xmath0-tilting modules and some other important notions in the representation theory of algebras , such as torsion classes , silting complexes , cluster - tilting objects , grothendieck groups and @xmath7-modules , see [ air ] , [ aii ] , [ bdp ] , [ ijy ] , [ ir ] , [ j ] , [ w ] , and so on .",
    "moreover , adachi gave in [ a ] a classification of @xmath0-tilting modules over nakayama algebras and an algorithm to construct the exchange quiver of support @xmath0-tilting modules .",
    "zhang studied in [ z ] @xmath0-rigid modules which are direct summands of support @xmath0-tilting modules over algebras with radical square zero .    on the other hand , the notion of skew group algebras was introduced in [ rr ] .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite - dimensional algebra and @xmath2 a finite group such that its order @xmath8 is invertible in @xmath1 acting on @xmath1 .",
    "the algebra @xmath1 and the skew group algebra @xmath6 have a lot of properties in common .",
    "the aim of this paper is to introduce and study @xmath2-stable support @xmath0-tilting modules and moreover to establish bijections among them and @xmath2-stable two - term silting complexes , @xmath2-stable functorially finite torsion classes , and @xmath2-stable cluster - tilting objects .",
