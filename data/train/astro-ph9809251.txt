    "since its launch in april 1991 , the experiments on board of the compton gamma ray observatory have detected many active galactic nuclei ( agns ) at photon energies@xmath15mev .",
    "42 agns have recently been identified as egret sources with high confidence ( mattox 1997 ) .",
    "a common characteristic of these sources is that they all are radio - loud , flat spectrum radio sources .",
    "many of them are seen as superluminal radio sources as well ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "all these agns belong to the blazar category ( containing bl lac objects , highly polarized ( @xmath17 ) quasars ( hpq ) , and optically violently variable ( ovv ) quasars ) , where relativistic beaming is thought to play an important role in the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "in fact , strong evidence for relativistic motion of the emitting plasma has been provided by the observation of superluminal expansion of radio knots to the radio core in numerous blazars ( vermeulen & cohen 1994 ) .",
    "observationally , blazar energy spectra appear to be contained of at least two components : a low - energy component with luminosity ( @xmath18 ) peaking in the ir - uv range , and a high - energy component with luminosity ( @xmath18 ) strongly dominated by hard @xmath0-rays , at least in those sources detected by egret .",
    "the division of spectra into two components is reflected by the deep drop of the low - energy component toward the far - uv band ( impey & neugebauer 1988 ; brown et al .",
    "1989a , 1989b ) , and the rise of @xmath18 toward higher energies in the x - ray band , observed clearly in most ovv quasars ( worrall & wilkes 1990 ) and most radio selected bl lac objects ( sambruna et al .",
    "the simplest models addressing the double - component nature of blazar spectra are those in which the low - energy component is produced by synchrotron radiation and the high - energy component is produced by the inverse - compton process .",
    "a variety of models have recently been proposed to explain the origin of the @xmath0-ray emission , including synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) radiation ( jones et al .",
    "1974 ; marscher 1980 ; k@xmath19nigl 1981 ; marscher & gear 1985 ; ghisellini & maraschi 1989 ; maraschi et al . 1992 ) and inverse - compton scattering on photons produced by the accretion disc ( melia & k@xmath19nigl 1989 ; dermer et al . 1992 ; dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ) , the broad - line region ( e.g. sikora et al .",
    "1994 ) or the dusty torus ( wagner et al .",
    "in addition to these models , there are also other models devoted to understand the @xmath0-ray emission mechanism of agns such as : diffusive shock acceleration in electron - proton jets producing high - energy emission through photomeson production and the subsequent cascade of secondary particles ( mannheim & biermann 1992 ; mannheim 1993a , 1993b ) ; synchrotron radiation in regions of high magnetic fields ( ghisellini 1993 ) ; and radiation from secondary electrons resulting from decays of ultrarelativistic neutrons emitted by the central engine ( e. g. mastichiadis & protheroe 1990 ) .    considering the strong association of identified egret agn sources with the blazar class , the fact that nearly @xmath20 of the egret agn sources are superluminal , and the success of jet models in explaining the non - thermal radiation from blazars",
    ", we will focus our discussion on @xmath0-ray emission models associated with jets .",
    "in fact , lately it has been established for the blazars 0528 + 134 ( pohl et al . 1995 ) , 3c279 ( wehrle et al .",
    "1996 ) and 1633 + 382 ( barthel et al . 1995 ) that enhanced levels of activity in the optical and @xmath0-ray bands are associated with the emergence of new jet components . in several models that have been proposed",
    ", the @xmath0-ray emission originates in a jet as a product of inverse - compton scattering of relativistic electrons and seed photons produced externally to the jet ( dermer et al .",
    "1992 ; sikora et al . 1994 ; wagner et al . 1995a ) .",
    "the importance of the process depends on the dominance of the externally produced radiation energy density ( as seen in the comoving frame of the jet ) with respect to magnetic energy density and the energy density of the radiation produced internally .",
    "if the seed photons are produced externally to the jet , then one can predict a correlation between the doppler factor @xmath11 and the ratio of the @xmath0-ray flux to the synchrotron radiation flux , @xmath21/@xmath22 , as was shown by eq .",
    "( 27 ) in dermer et al ( 1997 ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the ratio of the energy density in the external target radiation field and the blob s magnetic field .",
    "the ratio of the ssc spectral power flux at energy @xmath25 to the synchrotron spectral power flux at energy @xmath26 is given by eq .",
    "( 28 ) in dermer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the radius of the blob , assumed to be spherical in the comoving frame , and @xmath29 is the number density of nonthermal electrons .",
    "therefore , the flux ratio in the ssc model is independent of the doppler factor . with the requirement that @xmath0-rays do not interact with x - rays ( assumed cospatial ) through photon - photon collisions , dondi & ghisellini calculated the lower limit on the doppler boosting factor @xmath11 of the @xmath0 -ray emission for a sample of egret sources and found that relativistic motion is required in all cases .",
    "they compared the derived @xmath11 with other beaming factors such as the ratio between the @xmath0-ray flux density and the optical flux density , and found no obvious relation between the two different beaming factors .",
    "the emission models mentioned above imply a variety of relations between the emissions in different wavelength bands that can be used to distinguish among them observationally . in this paper",
    ", we present a compilation of flux densities in different wavelength bands for 27 blazars which are considered to be egret sources with high confidence ( mattox et al .",
    "1997 ) and the vlbi data of these sources if available .",
    "the data selection is described in sect .",
    "2 . in sect .",
    "3 we calculate the ratios of the @xmath0-ray flux density ( here defined as @xmath30 ) to the optical flux density , the near - infrared ( at 2.2 @xmath12 m ) flux density , and the millimeter ( 90 ghz , 230 ghz ) flux density .",
    "we derive the doppler factor based on the synchrotron - self - compton model ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1993 ) , and we investigate the correlation between the flux ratio and the doppler factor by using a linear regression analysis . in sect .",
    "4 , these correlation results are compared with theoretical results and their physical meaning is discussed .",
    "mattox et al . ( 1997 ) developed an analysis of egret radio source identification that quantitatively incorporates a lot of important information such as the size of the egret error region , the number density of potentially confusing radio sources , the radio spectral index and the a priori probability of detecting a radio source by egret .",
    "they provided a table of 42 blazars that were considered to be robust identifications of egret sources . in this paper , we will focus on a subset of these sources .",
    "they are listed in table 1 , whose columns are : ( 1 ) iau name ; ( 2 ) classification of the source ( b = bl lac object , hpq = highly polarized quasar , lpq = low polarized quasar , np = no polarization measurement ) ; ( 3 ) redshift ; ( 4 ) @xmath31-ray flux density above 100 mev , @xmath32 , in units of @xmath33 photon @xmath34 s@xmath35 ; ( 5 ) spectral index of the @xmath31-ray energy spectrum ; ( 6 ) reference for the @xmath31-ray flux density and spectral index ; ( 7 ) v - band optical flux density @xmath36 in mjy ; ( 8) reference for the optical flux density ; ( 9 ) near infrared flux density @xmath4 ( at 2.2 @xmath12 m ) in mjy ; ( 10 ) reference for the infrared flux density ; ( 11 ) flux density at 90 ghz ; ( 12 ) reference for the flux density at 90 ghz ; ( 13 ) flux density at 230 ghz ; ( 14 ) reference for the flux density at 230 ghz .",
    "table 1 lists 27 blazars which have been identified with high confidence by mattox et al ( 1997 ) and for which vlbi and x - ray observations ( 1 kev ) are available .",
    "all sources in table 2 are known to be variable , but only a few sources have been observed simultaneously at different wavelengths such as 3c273 , 3c279 .",
    "we therefore choose to list the highest flux densities for all sources from the literature , irrespective of the dates of the observations .",
    "the optical fluxes are mainly chosen from dondi & ghisellini ( 1995 ) who have chosen the maxima from the literature .",
    "the highest flux densities at 90 ghz and 230 ghz are mainly chosen from steppe et al .",
    "( 1988 , 1992 )",
    ". the classifications mainly refer to dondi & ghisellini ( 1995 ) and ghisellini et al .",
    "table 2 lists the vlbi and x - ray observations ; ( 1 ) iau name ; ( 2 ) redshift ; ( 3 ) vlbi core size(@xmath37 ) in mas ; ( 4 ) core radio flux density ( @xmath38 ) at frequency @xmath39 ; ( 5 ) observation frequency @xmath39 in ghz ; ( 6 ) reference for the vlbi data ; ( 7 ) 1 kev x - ray flux density @xmath40 in @xmath41jy ; ( 8) reference for the x - ray flux .",
    "the x - ray flux densities are mainly chosen from ghisellini ( 1993 ) .",
    "for those sources which have multi - frequency vlbi observations , the vlbi data at the highest frequency are chosen .",
    "by comparing the predicted and observed self - compton flux , one can derive @xmath11 in the case of a moving sphere ( p=3+@xmath42 ) ( ghisellini et al . 1993",
    ")    @xmath43^{1 / { ( 4 + 2\\alpha)}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the radio flux density and x - ray flux density in jy , @xmath46 is in kev , @xmath47 is the frequency of vlbi observation in ghz , @xmath48 is in mas , @xmath49 is the synchrotron high frequency cutoff ( assumed to be @xmath50 hz ) , and the function @xmath51 ( here @xmath52 is assumed ) .",
    "recently , an improved approach was proposed by jiang et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to derive the doppler factors based on an inhomogeneous jet model .",
    "however , the proper motion of knots is required in their derivation , which limits the number of sources in the sample . to make the sample as large as possible for the statistical analysis",
    ", we use the spherical model in this paper .",
    "the derived doppler factors @xmath11 are listed in table 2 .      also for the @xmath31-ray flux densities of the egret sources , the maximum observed fluxes ( @xmath15mev ) are chosen .",
    "the @xmath31 -ray photon flux of is transferred into an integrated energy flux between 0.1 gev and 5 gev ( i.e. @xmath55 ) .",
    "the reasons for choosing the maximum fluxes are : ( 1 ) all agns are variable sources and their radio emissions are mainly produced via synchrotron emission ; ( 2 ) in the optical band , both the blue bump and the starlight account for part of the optical emission , the synchrotron radiation varies rapidly and the contribution of both the blue bump and the starlight can be reduced by using the maximum flux ; ( 3 ) also , for the emission in the near infrared band , the contribution of thermal emission coming from the torus can be reduced . figs .",
    "1 and 2 show the ratio of the @xmath31-ray flux to the optical flux versus the doppler factor , and the ratio of the @xmath31-ray flux to the infrared flux versus the doppler factor , respectively .",
    "there is an obvious correlation between the flux density ratio and the doppler factor .",
    "the relation between the flux ratio and the doppler factor is : @xmath56 and @xmath57 when bl lac objects are excluded , the correlation remains present , but is less significant .      figs .",
    "3 and 4 show the ratio of the @xmath0-ray flux density to the millimeter ( 90 ghz , 230 ghz ) flux density versus the doppler factor .",
    "the correlation between @xmath58 and @xmath11 is poor .",

    "that the soft photons are compton up scattered to the @xmath31-ray range by nonthermal electrons in the relativisticly moving blobs might be the most favorable model for the @xmath31-ray emission .",
    "the soft photons could come from synchrotron emission in the blob , namely the ssc process , or from outside the moving blob .",
    "dermer ( 1995 ) proposed that the observed optically thin synchrotron flux density , combined with the compton - scattered photon flux density , can be used to test whether the high - energy radiation is produced through ssc or external compton scattering .",
    "we have examined the correlations between the ratio of the @xmath31-ray flux density to the flux density in different wavebands and the doppler factor @xmath67 .",
    "two significant correlations are found , namely between @xmath68and @xmath67 , and between @xmath69 and @xmath67 , which support the external compton scattering models for the high - energy @xmath31-ray emission .",
    "the obtained correlations suggest that the observed flux densities in the optical and near - infrared wavebands are mainly due to optically thin synchrotron emission in the blobs .",
    "the relation between the emission in the optical band and the emission in the @xmath31-ray band was also shown by the facts that the highest @xmath31-ray flux densities were recorded during the most prominent flare in the optical range for pks 0420 - 014 ( wagner et al .",
    "1995a ) and that a rapid flare peaked about 22 hours after the optical outburst for pks 1406 - 076 ( wagner et al .",
    ".    table 3 also lists the values of b , which corresponds to @xmath70 in formula ( 1 ) .",
    "the values of b are indeed close to @xmath70 ( @xmath71 has been assumed ) , in the optical case and in the infrared case ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively ) .",
    "the k in formula ( 1 ) is the ratio of the isotropic energy density to the energy density of magnetic field , which is about 4 - 5 in the optical and nir cases .    the doppler factors @xmath11 of the bl lac objects derived here are lower than those of other sources in the sample .",
    "the mechanism for x - ray radiation of bl lac objects is still not quite clear .",
    "we used here a single model to derive the doppler factor @xmath11 for all sources in the sample , including bl lacs , on the assumption that ssc accounts for x - ray emission .",
    "however , some authors ( urry 1994 ) suggested that the x - ray emission from bl lacs is due to synchrotron radiation instead of the synchrotron self - compton radiation . if this is true , the derivation of the bl lacs doppler factor @xmath11 here is questionable .",
    "compared with the optical and nir cases , the correlation @xmath74 is quite poor .",
    "one possible reason is that the synchrotron radiations in the millimeter wavebands is optically thick for some sources in the sample , whereas the theoretical model requires an optically thin synchrotron flux density . in additions ,",
    "the correlations between the flux ratios and the doppler factor show some deviation from the theoretical value b= @xmath70 .",
    "this may not be surprising since there are several factors that can affect the flux ratio @xmath75 .",
    "for example , the ssc radiation may account for part of the @xmath0-ray emission as well .",
    "for a few sources such as mrk421 , strong radiation is seen at tev energies , and for others such as 3c273 , the @xmath0-ray emission is probably concentrated in mev band , which will introduce errors in the correlation as well .",
    "in addition , the doppler factor @xmath11 we have derived is based on the blob model . to obtain this result",
    ", one must know the core angular size and the flux density at the turnover frequency . in practice",
    ", it is difficult to obtain this information , so one has to assume the vlbi observing frequency to be the synchrotron self - absorption frequency .",
    "furthermore , a single @xmath52 is assumed for all sources in our sample . the derivation of the doppler factor based on the blob model is clearly simplified .    by assuming that x - rays and @xmath0-rays are cospatial , and deriving the size of the source using the variability time - scale , dondi & ghisellini ( 1993 ) derived a lower limit @xmath76 on the doppler factor of a source .",
    "they compared the doppler factor with the flux ratio between the @xmath0-ray flux density and the optical flux density and found a marginal correlation .",
    "they also listed the doppler factors derived from the ssc model , but they did not compare the flux ratio with the @xmath77 .",
    "we compare their flux ratio with their @xmath78 and also find a strong correlation when excluding sources which were not identified with high confidence by mattox et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "the strong correlations between @xmath21/@xmath79 and @xmath11 as well as @xmath21/@xmath80 and @xmath11 show that the @xmath0-ray emission is more related to emission in the nir - opt band than to emission in the millimeter band .",
    "these results suggest that the relativistic electrons which are responsible for the optical emission are responsible for the @xmath0-ray emission as well .",
    "this favors a model in which the @xmath0-ray emission is due to inverse - compton scattering on photons external to the jet .",
    "we have studied a sample of egret agns which have recently been identified with high confidence and derive the doppler factors for most of these gamma sources by using vlbi and x - ray data on the assumption of a homogeneous spherical emission plasma .",
    "strong correlations between the flux ratio @xmath81 and @xmath67 as well as @xmath82 and @xmath67 are found , which is expected for inverse - compton scattering on photons from outside the jet .",
    "the poor correlations between the flux ratio @xmath83 and @xmath67 may be due to the optically thick synchrotron emission in the millimeter wavelength for some egret sources .",
