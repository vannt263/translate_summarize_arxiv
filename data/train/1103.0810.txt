    "successful syntheses of fullerene ( c@xmath0 ) molecules and related nanomaterials @xcite have inspired tremendous interest in the community of nanotechnology and nanoscience .",
    "experimental studies have shown that electron - beam irradiation to a c@xmath0 film induces polymerizations and produces one - dimensional ( 1d ) c@xmath0 polymers @xcite .",
    "the polymers have peanut - like geometry , i.e. , the tube structure with periodically modulated radius along the axis @xcite .",
    "such the peanut structure was confirmed by comparison between the infrared spectral measurement @xcite and the first - principle density - functional calculations of the vibrational spectra @xcite .",
    "recently , it was predicted that the periodic radius modulation strongly affects transport properties of the carrier in the 1d c@xmath0 polymers @xcite .",
    "similar periodic corrugation of a two - dimensional conducting film was also shown to increase the electrical resistivity @xcite .",
    "these findings are attributed to an effective electrostatic field caused by the periodic corrugation , which gives rise to a fermi velocity shift and electron - electron scattering enhancement .",
    "the 1d c@xmath0 polymers exhibit semiconducting or metallic nature depending on the irradiation time interval @xcite .",
    "this suggests that well - controlled irradiation time may lead the fabrication of quantum wires with desired conductivity .",
    "of particular interest is the metallic c@xmath0 polymers ; in the metallic cases , nonequiliblium photo - excited carriers exhibit anomalously slow relaxation below 60k , indicating pseudogap formation in the electron energy band near the fermi level @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , this pseudogap is likely to result from the peierls instability associated with a periodic distortion of the underlying carbon structure .",
    "however , its theoretical understanding has not been attained ; in fact , it has remained unclear how the periodic radius modulation in the c@xmath0 polymers affects the phononic excitations and electron - phonon couplings in the systems .",
    "we point out that the periodic geometry of the 1d c@xmath0 polymers will induce a pronounced shift in the low - frequency phonon spectrum where the phonon wavelength is comparable to the radius modulation period , i.e. , larger enough than the carbon bond length . in the low - frequency range ,",
    "continuum elastic approximation is a powerful means to analyze the phononic excitations .",
    "furthermore , the approximation allows to use the deformation potential theory @xcite that describes the electron - phonon interaction in a conducting medium . combining the two methods , therefore",
    ", we can formulate the radius modulation effect on the phonon spectrum and the electron - phonon interaction in the 1d c@xmath0 polymers ; the results obtained give a fundamental clue to explore novel properties of collective excitations in the system .    in this paper , we study the low - frequency phonons and their coupling with electrons in the 1d c@xmath0 polymers by using a continuum model . a generalized eigenvalue equation is formulated to obtain phonon dispersion relations that show zone - folding due to the periodic geometry .",
    "it is demonstrated that only a particular set of phonon modes , among many choices , yields marked enhancement in the electron - phonon coupling strength ; these specific phonon modes are thought to play a prominent role in the possible peierls instability in the 1d c@xmath0 polymers .",

    "all the processes belong to the normal process ( i.e. , @xmath187 ) . on the other hand , the rbm of the polymer ( @xmath192@xmath83 ) can decay through both the normal and umklapp processes ( @xmath188 ) involving l- and t - processes . due to many choices of @xmath193 available ,",
    "the number of decay process in the polymer is much larger than that in the straight tube , although the f - process in the polymer is forbidden as the dispersion curves with @xmath194 has the frequency gap around @xmath195 . in other words ,",

    "we have investigated the low - frequency phonon states and their coupling with electrons in the 1d peanut - shaped c@xmath0 polymers along the continuum approximation .",
    "it has been found that the phonon dispersion relations exhibit the zone - folding effect due to the periodic radial modulation .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction was formulated in line with the deformation potential theory , and the obtained formula for the coupling strength allows us to identify which phonon modes should be responsible for the peierls transition observed in the prior experiment .",
