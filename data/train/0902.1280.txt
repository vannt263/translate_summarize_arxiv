    "water is the most important liquid on earth .",
    "although its uniform phase already exhibits many fascinating properties and is currently an area of intensive research , the importance of the _ inhomogeneous _ phase in the chemical and biological sciences is even greater : as a solvent , water is ubiquitous in physical chemistry , biochemistry and electrochemistry .",
    "the associated phenomena include hydrophobic interactions @xcite , protein folding @xcite , the electrochemical interface @xcite , and phase transitions of confined liquids @xcite .",
    "due to the complex interplay of hydrogen bonding , long - range polar interactions , and short - range excluded volume effects , developing a tractable theory to describe the solvent in the aforementioned systems remains a challenge @xcite .    despite the importance , inherent interest , and extensive experimental study of water , most existing theories of the inhomogeneous phase of water",
    "either lack the accuracy to describe the above phenomena in a quantitatively satisfying way or become computationally prohibitive .",
    "the latter is particularly true for applications to complex systems , such as dissolved biomolecules or electrochemical interfaces .",
    "simple dielectric continuum theories @xcite capture the dielectric response of the solvent at long length scales , but fail to describe more subtle effects at interfaces , such as the reorganization of the hydrogen - bond network or the binding of water molecules to solutes .",
    "atomistic theories , on the other hand , describe such local effects quite well , but require the explicit treatment of many solvent molecules and also demand long simulation times to calculate statistically reliable thermodynamic averages .",
    "since the full - fledged _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics description of the solvent is only feasible for the smallest solutes , generally additional approximations become necessary in practice : bernholc and coworkers , for example , have introduced a clever scheme which employs the full _ ab initio _ description only for a few solvent molecules adjacent to the solute and use rigid geometries and frozen electron densities for the remaining molecules @xcite . in other studies , combination of _ ab initio _",
    "methods for the solute with classical force field approaches @xcite for the solvent yields additional simplifications . despite the simplifications which such hybrid approaches allow , the need to compute many configurations to sample phase - space properly ultimately limits the size of systems which can be studied and thus the applicability of such approaches .",
    "ideally , one would have a rigorous description of the solvent which is able to combine the advantages of continuum theories ( large system sizes and _ implicit _ thermodynamic averaging ) with an explicit geometric description of the solvent molecule . here , we show that just such a theory can be developed for liquid water by starting with the quantum mechanical free - energy functional for both the electrons and nuclei which comprise the liquid and , by `` integrating out '' the electrons , proceeding to construct a density functional in terms of atomic site densities alone .",
    "such `` classical '' density - functional theories , which are founded on a number of exact theorems @xcite , have been applied successfully to the study of simple liquids in the past @xcite .",
    "historically , application of this method begins with a hard sphere reference system that is usually augmented by terms that capture weak long - range attractive forces @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a hard sphere reference system is a poor starting point for the description of water because of the strong anisotropic short - range interactions arising from the molecular structure , including effects such as hydrogen bonding .    to remedy this , chandler and coworkers @xcite introduced a density - functional theory for general molecular liquids in terms of a set of densities , one for each `` interaction site '' on the molecule ( typically atomic centers ) .",
    "although their theory successfully predicted the correct hydrogen - bonded structure of ice @xcite , it suffered from a significant flaw : to make calculations tractable , the `` united atom approximation '' , which takes all of the sites on the molecule to sit at a single point , had to be invoked .",
    "this severe oversimplification of the molecular structure prohibited the description of dielectric properties and stalled the further development of this promising approach . in @xcite , we eliminated the need for the united atom approximation by writing the free energy of a general molecular liquid as a functional of a set of effective potentials in which fictitious non - interacting molecules move .",
    "this advance allows for the exact evaluation of the entropy associated with the geometric structure of the molecules in a numerically feasible way and forms the basis for the construction of a new class of accurate density functionals for fully interacting _ molecular _ liquids .",
    "in this work , we apply our general theory of molecular liquids to water and demonstrate how an accurate free - energy functional can be developed to reproduce the equation of state , the experimental site - site correlation functions , and the macroscopic dielectric response . the organization of the work is as follows .",
    "section 2 gives a brief review of the general theory of molecular liquids introduced in @xcite .",
    "section 3 discusses the application of this approach to the particular case of water and introduces new computational techniques to simplify calculations of triatomic liquids .",
    "section 4 presents results obtained using this new microscopically - informed continuum theory to study the behavior of water in a parallel plate capacitor . here",
    ", we explore the differences between capacitor plates consisting either of purely repulsive hard walls or of walls with a local region of attraction .",
    "we also explore the dielectric response of water in both the linear and the nonlinear regimes of the applied field . comparing our results to previous works based on explicit molecular simulations",
    ", we find quite encouraging agreement .",
    "section 5 then concludes this work .",
    "in @xcite , we showed that the grand free energy @xmath0 of an assembly of interacting identical molecules ( consisting of @xmath1 atoms or `` interaction sites '' each ) can be expressed as a functional of a set of effective potentials @xmath2 , in which a corresponding set of fictitious non - interacting molecules move .",
    "specifically , we wrote @xmath3= \\omega^{(ni)}[\\mathbf{\\psi}]- \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{m}\\int d^{3}r \\left ( \\psi_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r})-\\phi_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r})+\\mu_{\\alpha}\\right ) n_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r } ) \\nonumber\\\\ + u[\\mathbf{n } ] . \\label{fullomega}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath4 is the site - dependent external potential ( with @xmath5 referring to the different atomic sites on each molecule ) , @xmath6 is a site specific chemical potential and @xmath7 $ ] denotes the excess free energy due to inter - molecular interactions , which is a functional of the set of site densities @xmath8 . finally , @xmath9 $ ] is the grand free energy of an assembly of noninteracting molecules in a set of effective potentials @xmath10 .",
    "this free energy is known explicitly and is _ exactly _ @xmath11=-k_{b}tn_{l }   \\int d^{3m}r\\;s(\\{\\mathbf{r}_\\alpha\\ } )   e^{-\\beta\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{m}\\psi_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}_{\\alpha } ) } \\label{freeeni},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the reference density at vanishing chemical potentials ( which we will later take to be the bulk liquid density ) and @xmath13 , which describes the geometry of the molecule , is the intra - molecular distribution function .",
    "note that we take the densities in ( [ fullomega ] ) to be themselves functionals of the effective fields via @xmath14.\\ ] ] finally , the effective potentials which minimize @xmath15 $ ] determine the equilibrium site densities and allow for the calculation of various equilibrium properties of the liquid .",
    "the introduction of effective potentials instead of site density fields as fundamental variables in the density - functional theory of classical molecular liquids allows for the first time a computationally tractable approach to treat the non - interacting system exactly .",
    "this parallels the introduction of kohn - sham orbitals as fundamental variables in the density - functional theory of electronic structure @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the construction of highly accurate density functionals is made possible by mapping a system of interacting particles onto a fictitious system of noninteracting particles with the same equilibrium densities .",
    "we mention that our approach of minimizing the free energy with respect to a set of _ effective potentials _ is known in the electronic structure context as the optimized effective potential method @xcite .      in @xcite , we also present a recipe for the construction of the excess free energy functional @xmath16 in ( [ fullomega ] ) . as usual with density - functional theories , this construction is difficult . as in our previous work ,",
    "we follow the lead of kohn and sham and construct a free - energy functional that reproduces established results for the homogeneous phase in the limit of vanishing external fields .",
    "namely , we expand @xmath16 in a power series about the uniform liquid , and formally group all terms except the quadratic part , which is analogous to the hartree energy in electronic - structure theory , into an unknown functional @xmath17 $ ] , which is then the analogue to the electronic exchange - correlation functional , whose form , being unknown , must ultimately be treated in some approximate way .    to proceed , we separate the kernel of the quadratic part of @xmath16 into a long - wavelength part @xmath18 , known analytically for the case of rigid molecules , and a remainder @xmath19 , to be determined from experimental data .",
    "the next paragraph describes @xmath18 in detail , and the set of functions @xmath19 will be constructed below such that the resulting functional reproduces the experimental correlation functions in the uniform phase .",
    "when these two parts are determined , they combine with @xmath20 to give @xmath16 as @xmath21=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\alpha,\\gamma=1}^{m}\\int d^{3}r \\int d^{3}r'\\ ; n_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r})\\left\\ { k_{\\alpha\\gamma}(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r ' } ) \\right .",

    "to demonstrate the ability of our density - functional theory to describe water in an inhomogeneous environment and to capture the dielectric response of the liquid , we study the behavior of the liquid in a parallel plate capacitor .",
    "we carry out our study at standard temperature and pressure described above , taking the system to be homogeneous in the two dimensions parallel to the capacitor plates . along the perpendicular direction , we impose periodic boundary conditions , defining a unit cell containing _ two _ parallel plate capacitors with opposing externally applied electric fields .",

    "in particular , we use @xmath178 with @xmath179 and @xmath180   . for the attractive case ,",

    "this potential has its minimum at a distance of 3     from the wall at a depth @xmath185  ev .",

    "for instance , berkowitz and co - workers @xcite employ a corrugated potential with an average depth of about 0.40  ev , which is also in the range of a couple of tenths of an electron volt .    to determine the thermodynamic state of the system",
    "we then expand the density fields on a real space grid with 8192 sampling points ( @xmath186 points /  ) , and minimize the grand free energy ( [ fullomega ] ) using standard numerical conjugate gradient techniques without any preconditioning .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion of our results for the hard wall case as an idealized reference for comparison .",
    "figure  [ zerofield ] shows our results for oxygen and hydrogen equilibrium density profiles in the absence of an externally applied electrostatic displacement ( @xmath187 ) and compares them to the density profiles of hydrogen and oxygen sites in a relatively weak external field ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "the zero - field profiles exhibit an extended gas phase region up to a distance of @xmath189    from the plates .",
    "this `` lingering '' gas phase region exists because molecules can , at very little free - energy cost , minimize the influence of the repulsive plates by leaving the system .",
    "( recall that ( [ fullomega ] ) is written in the grand canonical ensemble , so that the system can exchange particles with an external reservoir . ) as soon as a relatively weak external electric displacement is applied , however , it becomes favorable for the dipolar molecules to enter the system because they can lower their energy by partially aligning with the field within the capacitor . for",
    "even quite small fields , this effect causes the capacitor to fill with liquid , thereby eliminating most of the gas phase region .",
    "the result of this is then an almost rigid shift of the density profiles toward the capacitor plates , with an appearance and general shape which remains nearly fixed over a large range of fields .",
    "considering the fine details of the density profiles , we note that , contrary to our previous results for diatomic liquids , a relatively small ( barely noticeable in the figure ) asymmetry exists at zero external field between the oxygen and hydrogen site densities so that there is a non - vanishing electrostatic charge density in the vicinity of the capacitor plates  even in the absence of an externally applied electric field .",
    "( note : because the oxygen site carries a charge which is double in magnitude compared to the hydrogen site and because there are two independent but identical hydrogen sites , the magnitude of the charges carried by the oxygen and hydrogen density fields are directly proportional to the curves in the figure , _ with the same constant of proportionality _ for each . ) by symmetry , the net charge which the plates induce must integrate to zero ; however , a finite surface dipole remains with a corresponding potential jump which we find in the zero - field hard - wall case to be + @xmath190  v across the solid - liquid interface , with the potential being higher in the solid .",
    "figure  [ d197 ] shows the equilibrium density profiles in a relatively strong ( @xmath191 ) external field directed from left to right in the figure .",
    "the relative abundance of oxygen sites close to the left plate ( which carries a positive external charge to generate the field ) and of hydrogen sites next to the right plate ( which carries a negative external charge ) indicates that the water molecules exhibit a strong tendency to align their dipoles with the applied field .",
    "interestingly , this leads to quite different density profiles on the opposite sides of the capacitor . on the left ( positive ) plate , the first peak in the oxygen density",
    "is followed by a peak in the hydrogen density of similar shape , width and height .",
    "this we interpret to be a direct consequence of alignment of the molecules with the field and the rigid intra - molecular bonding between hydrogen and oxygen atoms , an effect quite similar to what was observed in our previous study of liquid hydrogen chloride@xcite .",
    "the distance between these peaks , 0.65   , is within about 10% of 0.58   , what one expects from the basic geometry of the water molecule assuming that the molecules fully align with the field .    on the right ( negative )",
    "plate , we again find a well - defined peak in the oxygen density , though the peak is somewhat stronger than on the left .",
    "we find also that the hydrogen density , rather than being also sharply peaked , is now spread significantly around the oxygen peak .",
    "this case is different , because the hydrogen sites , now pointing away from the liquid region , can not form hydrogen bonds if the molecules align fully with the field .",
    "figure  [ ljzerofield ] compares the zero - field results for the hard - wall plates with those of the attractive plates .",
    "there is no longer a `` lingering '' gas phase region because the minimum in the interaction potential ( acting only on the oxygen sites in this case ) with the plates sets the location of the main peak in the oxygen density .",
    "this minimum , as described above , occurs at a distance of about 3    from the attractive walls and corresponds well with the peaks in the oxygen and hydrogen density profiles .",
    "the height of the oxygen peak is larger than the density in the bulk by a factor of @xmath192 , which is similar to the results of molecular dynamics calculations of water adjacent to platinum surfaces @xcite and experimental findings @xcite .",
    "finally , there is also a net dipole layer in our attractive case leading now to a significantly stronger potential jump at the liquid - solid interface of @xmath193  v , with the potential in the solid again being higher .",
    "this value is typical of realistic systems : from molecular dynamics data of water adjacent to a platinum surface@xcite , we extract a potential jump of @xmath194  v with the potential being higher in the solid .        when a strong field ( again , @xmath191 ) is applied to the capacitor with attractive walls ( figure  [ phild197 ] )",
    ", we find a rearrangement of the liquid structure which exhibits various quantitative differences compared to the hard - wall case : the oxygen peaks are now significantly more pronounced ( reaching values near 4 and 5 times the equilibrium liquid density , as opposed to the previous peak values near 1.5 and 2.2 ) as the oxygen atoms settle into the attractive potential wells near the walls .",
    "also , the peak near the positive plate is also now notably broader ( with a width of 1.6     at the value of the equilibrium , as opposed to the previous value of 1.0   ) . finally , the hydrogen peak is significantly less pronounced relative to the oxygen peak and the peak position is now less displaced ( 0.4   ) from the oxygen peak position . despite these quantitative differences , however , the qualitative features at strong fields are quite similar in the attractive and the hard - wall cases .",
    "namely , on the left ( positive ) plate we find a well - defined peak in the oxygen density followed by a corresponding peak in the hydrogen density , and on the right ( negative ) plate there is a well - defined oxygen peak which is surrounded by a more diffuse peak in the hydrogen density .",
    "also , as with the hard wall case , we find that the hydrogen peak is off - center from the oxygen peak and displaced toward the negative plate to which it is attracted .",
    "this suggests that , at these large field strengths , general features are independent of the exact form of the liquid - solid interaction .",
    "in fact , we note that this sort of asymmetry between positive and negative plates is also evident in molecular dynamics calculations which , at fields near @xmath195 , also tend to show that , near the positive plate , the oxygen density exhibits peaks which are followed by peaks of similar appearance in the hydrogen density , whereas , near the negative plate , there is a well - defined peak in the oxygen density but that the hydrogen density exhibits either a broader peak or multiple sub - peaks in the vicinity of the main oxygen peak@xcite",
    ".          the equilibrium site densities also determine the dielectric function of water @xmath196 with @xmath197 being the total electric field given by the sum of the electric displacement and the induced electric field .",
    "although @xmath197 has a complicated form close to the walls , it rapidly approaches the constant value @xmath198 as the distance from the walls increases , where @xmath75 is the induced polarization . in the present one - dimensional geometry",
    ", @xmath75 is proportional to the induced surface charge which appears in the equilibrium density profiles .",
    "figure  [ dielectric ] shows our calculated results for @xmath25 plotted as a function of @xmath197 in units of mv / m ( equivalent to 1  mv / nm or 0.1  mv /  ) to simplify comparison with the results of previous studies .",
    "the figure shows that the results from our density - functional theory are well - described by self - consistently screened nonlinear electrostatics ( solid curve ) , which gives the polarization @xmath75 as the self - consistent solution to the equation @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is the response of a gas of noninteracting dipoles in a local field @xmath197 and",
    "@xmath201 ensures that the correct linear response is recovered when @xmath202 is weak .",
    "the solid curve reproduces our data well and so represents a convenient analytic guide to the eye for our results .",
    "figure  [ dielectric ] compares our results to booth s analytical result for the nonlinear dielectric response of water @xcite .",
    "this result ( dashed curve in the figure ) was obtained by extending onsager s and kirkwood s theories of polar dielectrics to high field strengths @xcite and also reproduces quite well explicit molecular dynamics results for high fields .",
    "it fails , however , at small fields , eventually giving an incorrect linear dielectric constant of about @xmath203 .",
    "we find very good agreement with this established result for fields larger than @xmath204  mv / m .",
    "we also compare our results to various molecular dynamics calculations @xcite and find very good agreement , except at zero field , where the results of the molecular dynamics calculations often show a wide range of results , some differing significantly from the experimental dielectric constant of @xmath205 depending on the model potentials and numerical methods employed@xcite .",
    "the zero - field dielectric constant , we , of course , reproduce exactly by construction .",
    "our results , therefore , appear to be reliable over a broad range of applied fields .",
    "this work demonstrates how to apply a new , general kohn - sham classical density - functional approach for molecular liquids to what is arguably the liquid of greatest scientific interest , water .",
    "the resulting theory has the quite tractable computational cost of the problem of a noninteracting gas of molecules in a self - consistent external potential and gives an exact account of the entropy associated with the alignment of the molecular dipole moment with an external field .    after constructing the functional and giving a complete numerical parameterization of all quantities so that our results are numerically reproducible",
    ", we demonstrate the tractability of the approach by applying it to the behavior of water in parallel plate capacitors , with either hard - wall or attractive plates , over a range of applied fields through which the dielectric constant @xmath25 of water varies by over a factor of two .",
    "we provide results for the distribution of oxygen and hydrogen atoms near the capacitor plates and find an asymmetry between the response at negatively and positively charged plates in general qualitative agreement with molecular dynamics results . from the resulting charge distributions ,",
    "we extract predictions of the dielectric constant of water over a wide range of field strengths ( 0 to 800  mv / m ) and find results in very good agreement with both previous theoretical and molecular dynamics calculations .",
    "the aforementioned exact treatment of the entropy cost of aligning the molecules with the field is critical in producing this accurate treatment of dielectric saturation effects .    with a successful framework in place",
    ", there is now a firm basis for future improvements .",
    "given that we now have a good treatment of the internal structure of the water molecule , the primary area remaining for improvement is our choice to employ for this first work a somewhat simplistic weighted - density functional form in ( [ fex ] ) .",
    "the direct route to improve upon this is to leverage much of the existent work in simple fluids , both in traditional weighted density - functional theories@xcite and in fundamental measure theory@xcite .",
    "another clear area for improvement would be the inclusion of additional , ionic species into the functional to allow for screening by electrolytes , which should be relatively straightforward .    in sum , we present a new framework for a computationally tractable continuum description of water which captures , within a unified approach with a firm theoretical foundation , molecular - scale correlations , entropic effects , microscopic dielectric screening , surface tension , bulk thermodynamic properties , and dielectric saturation .",
    "this description thus includes _ a priori _ all of the various effects which are generally added _ a posteriori _ to continuum models of water . although less detailed than current explicit molecular treatments of the solvent , freed from the need for computing thermodynamic averages , a sufficiently accurate continuum approach such as we present has the potential to open up much larger and complex systems to theoretical study .",
    "as such , the new framework is an ideal starting point for a variety of new investigations into a wide class of subjects , which include protein folding , molecular motors , membrane physics , drug design , the electrochemical interface , liquid - phase catalysis and fuel cells .",

    "<S> we present an accurate free - energy functional for liquid water written in terms of a set of effective potential fields in which fictitious noninteracting water molecules move . the functional contains an _ exact _ expression of the entropy of noninteracting molecules and thus provides an ideal starting point for the inclusion of complex inter - molecular interactions which depend on the _ orientation _ of the interacting molecules . </S>",
    "<S> we show how an excess free - energy functional can be constructed to reproduce the following properties of water : the dielectric response ; the experimental site - site correlation functions ; the surface tension ; the bulk modulus of the liquid and the variation of this modulus with pressure ; the density of the liquid and the vapor phase ; and liquid - vapor coexistence . as a demonstration , we present results for the application of this theory to the behavior of liquid water in a parallel plate capacitor . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we make predictions for the dielectric response of water in the nonlinear regime , finding excellent agreement with known data . </S>"
