    "over the past decade a picture of the universe has emerged from a number of cosmological observations which have shed light on its geometry , matter content and clustering properties @xcite .",
    "most astonishing amongst these findings is certainly the existence of `` dark energy '' which dominates the total energy density of the universe and which is responsible for its present state of accelerated expansion @xcite .    despite the accurate measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies , the sn ia luminosity distance observations and the detailed mapping of the large scale matter distribution",
    ", the nature of this exotic component still remains unknown and little progress has been made so far in this field , both at theoretical and observational level .",
    "the cosmological constant has been advocated as the simplest candidate , since it is physically motivated representing the energy contribution of the vacuum .",
    "however we have no convincing explanation as to why the observed value is extremely small compared to particle physics expectations .",
    "alternative scenarios have flourished in the recent past , although none seems to provide a consistent particle physics formulation . for a recent review see padmanabhan ( 2005 ) .",
    "supernova type ia observations give the strongest evidence in favor of dark energy @xcite , nonetheless the limited number of measurements are still affected by large experimental and systematic uncertainties which prevent further insights .",
    "consequently many questions about the properties of dark energy still remain unanswered . for instance it would be crucial to know whether the dark energy is time dependent or not , whether it clusters , whether its effects are caused by an exotic form of matter or by a different behavior of gravity on the large scales .",
    "recent data analysis have shown that current observations lack the necessary accuracy to address these very issues ( see for instance corasaniti et al .",
    "2004 and reference therein ) .",
    "complementary to the sn ia observations , several other tests of dark energy have been studied in a vast literature including baryon acoustic oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum @xcite , cluster number counts @xcite , weak lensing shear measurements @xcite just to mention a few . improving the accuracy and reducing the systematics is the necessary condition for these methods to be effective .",
    "however they are all limited to some extent by degeneracies between dark energy and the other cosmological parameters .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that one single experiment may reveal the nature of dark energy .",
    "progress seems only possible through a synergy of these different tests .",
    "the advanced liquid - mirror probe of asteroids , cosmology and astrophysics ( alpaca ) is a proposal for the realization of a ground based liquid - mirror telescope surveying a strip of sky of the southern - hemisphere .",
    "the survey will collect a huge amount of data divided in several datasets pertaining to sn ia light curves , high redshift galaxies and weak lensing .",
    "in this paper we study the constraints on dark energy from the estimated distribution of sn ia observed during the nominal duration of the survey , and from the expected level of detection of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ alpaca ]",
    "we give an overview of the project . in section  [ snbao ]",
    "we discuss datasets that the survey is expected to provide , in particular sn ia observations , baryon acoustic oscillations and weak lensing . in section  [ fisher ]",
    "we introduce the fisher matrix analysis and in section  [ results ] we present our results . finally in section  [ conclu ]",
    "we discuss our conclusions .",
    "alpaca is an 8-meter liquid mirror telescope which will incorporate a @xmath4-wide imaging field and will be sited on cerro tololo ( ctio ) in northern chile .",
    "it is amazingly cost effective , delivering more information than virtually any competing survey instrument but at a small fraction of the cost .",
    "it will be a remarkably simple and inexpensive telescope that nonetheless will deliver powerful samples of optical data that are suitable for dark energy studies .",
    "the concept of large , liquid - mirror telescope ( lmt ) is fairly new , although lmts have successfully operated for over a decade ( cabanac , borra & beauchemin 1998 ; hickson & mulrooney 1998 ) .",
    "serious difficulties which compromised the past optical performance of lmt have now been eliminated .",
    "the result of these advancements in the liquid - mirror technology is seeing - dominated imaging .",
    "the next generation of lmt such as alpaca can therefore compete with standard large optical telescopes for many projects .",
    "alpaca imaging quality is expected to be limited only by the seeing at ctio , hence @xmath5 .",
    "the cosmological survey field will cover @xmath6 @xmath7 in five bands ( @xmath8 ) with limiting nightly ab magnitudes in the range 23rd to 25th over a large fraction of the field .",
    "four of the five photometric bands @xmath9 ( 310 - 410 nm ) , @xmath10 ( 415 - 555 nm ) , @xmath11 ( 560 - 745 nm ) and @xmath12 ( 750 - 1050 nm ) are spaced evenly in @xmath13 ( @xmath14 being the wavelength ) , so that k - correction uncertainty vanishes at the special ratios of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . a fifth band @xmath17 ( 950 - 1050 nm )",
    "is especially useful for isolating high - redshift objects .",
    "an additional @xmath18 @xmath7 will be covered at lower sensitivity .",
    "alpaca will observe the field passing directly overhead at ctio , some @xmath4 across , of which @xmath19 are well suited for cosmological work .",
    "the focal plane s ccds operate in drift - scan mode , each ccd reobserves the same strip of sky each night , making image subtraction and further analysis procedures stable , simple and redundant .",
    "we are also exploring installation of a multiobject spectrograph .",
    "the nominal duration of the survey is 3 years , at which time the flux depth will approach the crowding limit .",
    "the total amount of data collected during the three years run is expected to be of several petabytes .",
    "observations of sn ia standard candle luminosity distance are expected to provide the bulk of the cosmological data , other datasets will include weak lensing , baryon oscillations , cluster number counts , strong - lens time delays , and cross - correlation multiple - waveband methods , such as isw - correlation with cmb maps and x - ray galaxy clusters .",
    "supernovae type ia light curves are related by one parameter family relation between the time - width and the maximum - light peak @xcite . as consequence of this sn",
    "ia are standardizable candles and can be used as distance indicators ( riess , press & kirshner 1996 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 ; phillips 1999 ) .",
    "models of supernova have been intensely investigated for decades , but only in the past few years have three - dimensional numerical simulations provided a better understanding of the physical processes which take place during the explosive phase ( see hoflich et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for a recent review ) .",
    "the most accredited scenario consists of a carbon / oxygen ( c / o ) white dwarf ( wd ) accreting material from an evolved companion star .",
    "as the wd reaches the chandrasekar mass , the compressional heating triggers a thermo - nuclear explosion in the wd s core that propagates to the outer layers .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "uncovering the nature of dark energy is the new challenge of modern observational cosmology . over the upcoming years lots of effort will be dedicated to improving luminosity distance measurements of sn ia standard candles and extend observations to complementary dark energy tests , such as baryon acoustic oscillations and cosmic shear weak lensing . in order to accomplish such a program several experiments have been proposed both from ground and space .",
    "here we have presented the alpaca survey and described the main datasets that the project is expected to provide .",
    "the bulk of the data is represented by high signal - to - noise , multiband , nightly sn ia light curves . at the end of the three year",
    "run alpaca is expected to observe @xmath2 supernovae distributed in the range @xmath20 and several hundreds at lower redshifts .",
    "this huge dataset will be useful for finding possible subclass of sn ia at different redshifts and correlations in the multiband light curves beyond the brighter - slower relation .",
    "this will allow for calibration of the standard - candle relation and reduction of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "in this paper we have forecasted limits on dark energy parameters from the expected redshift distribution of sn ia and the detection of baryon acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum . although the accuracy of bao measurements can not compete with dedicated surveys such as kaos @xcite or lsst @xcite , combining them with sn ia data will provide competitive constraints under minimal prior assumptions .",
    "alpaca will also deliver several other datasets and will be particularly suitable for weak lensing measurements .",
    "alpaca stakes out a regime in survey parameter space that is unique and useful , the intensive nightly , multiband monitoring of fields of order 1000 @xmath1 .",
    "while in principle other surveys such as lsst , pan - starrs , jdem or des are instrumented for such intensive monitoring , in practice they are driven by other motivations such as all - sky transient monitoring or weak - lensing mapping , devoting much less time than alpaca to the 1000 @xmath1 goal . indeed , using these like alpaca would be inefficient , since alpaca is extremely economical for this application compared to one of these more flexible instruments .",
    "liquid - mirror techniques have now reached such a high level of quality that liquid - mirror telescopes may be used for astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "the alpaca project will take advantage of this and provide high quality data at a fraction of the cost of standard 8-meter telescopes or space missions .",
    "the vast possibilities of the alpaca survey are still not fully explored and further investigation is needed .",
    "we are grateful to all members of the alpaca collaboration and we are particularly thankful to david branch , paul hickson , ben johnson , ken lanzetta , nick suntzeff , jun zhang , yun wang and ludovic van waerbeke for useful discussions and suggestions .",
