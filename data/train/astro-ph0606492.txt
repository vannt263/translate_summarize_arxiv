    "sensitive x - ray observations are an increasingly - important tool for studying young star clusters , particularly now that the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and the _ newton _ x - ray multi - mirror mission have made harder x - rays ( 210 kev ) available for study .",
    "young stars of all types are strong x - ray sources , with low - mass ( @xmath10@xmath113@xmath8 ) pre - main - sequence stars producing x - rays in their active magnetic coronae @xcite , and massive ob stars ( @xmath10@xmath68@xmath8 ) producing x - rays through shocks in their stellar winds @xcite . therefore , using observations of local star forming regions ( e.g. , orion ) as templates , measurements of the integrated x - ray luminosities of more distant clusters can be used to constrain their total stellar population , including the numbers of young stars that may be unobservable in the optical and infrared because of extinction or source confusion @xcite .    x - ray observations of clusters of massive stars also reveal diffuse x - ray emission that is produced as stellar winds encounter each other and the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "westerlund 1 is also located only @xmath05 kpc away @xcite , so it is one of the closest young , dense star clusters .",

    "we suggest that westerlund 1 is one of only a few star clusters to produce mostly non - thermal x - rays .",
    "we discuss the contraints that this places on the contributions of pre - main - sequence stars (  3.1 ) , stellar winds (  3.2 ) , and supernovae (  3.3 ) to the diffuse emission , and examine what could be causing non - thermal emission (  3.4 ) .",

    "the half - width half - maximum of the distribution is 25@xmath41 , which for a distance of 5",
    "kpc corresponds to 0.5 pc .",
    "the widths of the distributions of both optical stars and point - like x - ray sources are also @xmath025   @xcite .",
    "moreover , the centroid of the diffuse emission lies within the 5  uncertainty in the centroid of the point sources , @xcite , although it is @xmath020   from the cetroid of the optically - detected stars @xcite .",

    "even 5  from the cluster core , 60% of the flux was from westerlund 1 , so there is a broad halo of diffuse x - rays around the cluster .",
    "in contrast , although a few o stars that are cluster members are located beyond @xmath343  from the cluster core @xcite , the surface density of x - ray point sources beyond 3  is consistent that of the galactic disk @xcite , so there is no similar halo of point - like x - ray sources .      guided by figure  [ fig : diffdist ] , we extracted spectra , response functions , and effective area curves for a circular 1  region around the cluster center , and annular regions 12 , 23.5 , and 3.55  from the cluster center .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra are displayed in figure  [ fig : diffspec ] , in units of detector counts per square arcminute .",
    "the spectra contained contributions from at least three sources of x - rays : plasma and unresolved stars in the cluster , diffuse emission from the galactic plane , and events produced by particles incident on the detectors .",
    "the spectrum of the background from particles has been well - characterized using observations in which the acis detectors were stowed out of the focal plane .",
    "therefore , we subtracted the spectrum of the particle background from our source spectra .",
    "however , we were not able to make a local estimate of the galactic emission , because the cluster emission extended over the entire image .",
    "we have not attempted to subtract the galactic plane emission from the spectra of the diffuse emission from westerlund 1 , but have estimated the contribution of the galactic emission by modeling a spectrum from observations of a field at @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we modeled the emission using version 12.2.0 of xspec @xcite .",
    "we chose to model only the 1.58 kev energy range , for two reasons .",
    "first , the mean absorption column measured from the x - ray spectra of the point sources in westerlund 1 is equivalent to @xmath35 @xmath16 of hydrogen ( j. s. clark , in prep . )",
    ". therefore , most of the observed x - ray flux from the cluster should emerge at energies above @xmath342 kev , and the lower - energy x - rays are probably from foreground emission .",
    "second , given that the diffuse emission from westerlund 1 is probably from several different sources , we do not have enough physical guidance to extrapolate our models below 2 kev .",
    "when we try to apply simple models , the inferred de - reddened 0.52.0 kev flux can span an order - of - magnitude depending upon the model assumptions .",
    "the lower bound was chosen to include the prominent line at 1.8 kev in the spectra from the inner 2  of the cluster .",
    "for consistency with the other works quoted in  3 , we report the observed and de - reddened 28 kev fluxes .",
    "we first attempted to model the spectrum as a single temperature thermal plasma , either in or out of collisional ionization equilibrium , absorbed by the interstellar medium .",
    "we found that those simple models provided a poor description of the data from the inner 2  of the cluster ( @xmath36 ) .",

    "the large x - ray luminosities can be explained several ways : the densities of the cluster winds could be higher than expected because the stellar winds entrained cooler material or because radiative losses decreased the temperature of the shocked plasma @xcite ; the wind energy could be dissipated through heat conduction where it encounters nearby molecular clouds @xcite ; or the wind could be confined by the surrounding ism @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the large x - ray luminosities might partly result from the fact that unresolved pre - main - sequence stars should contribute significantly to the luminosity of the ( apparently ) diffuse emission , especially for more distant clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "westerlund 1 is at least as massive as ngc 3603 , r136 , and the arches @xcite , so from an observational standpoint the luminosity of its diffuse x - rays ( @xmath95\\times10^{34}$ ] erg s@xmath2 ; 28 kev ) is understandable .",
    "however , the spectrum and spatial distribution of the diffuse x - ray emission from westerlund 1 presents more of a puzzle .",
    "first , the spectrum lacks the line emission from he - like fe that would be expected from a thermal plasma given the hard continuum flux .",
    "in contrast , the spectra of pre - main sequence stars exhibit prominent lines from he - like and h - like si , s , ar , and fe that imply metal abundances up to ten times the solar value ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it is possible that the diffuse flux is dominated by plasma from the o and wr star winds , with little contribution from pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "it is also possible that the diffuse emission is non - thermal , by analogy with similar interpretations for the hard flux from a handful of young stellar associations , including rcw 38 @xcite , dem l192 ( n51d ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 30 dor c @xcite , and possibly the arches cluster @xcite . in most of the above cases ,",
    "the non - thermal emission has been interpreted as synchrotron emission from supernova remnants .",
    "we will examine this hypothesis for westerlund 1 in  [ sec : nonthermal ] .",
    "the second surprise is that the the diffuse x - ray emission from westerlund 1 seems to extend far beyond the core of the cluster . within the inner 2",
    ", the surface brightness of the diffuse emission falls off with a half - width half - maximum of 0.5 pc ( fig .  [",
    "fig : diffimg ] and [ fig : diffdist ] ) , which is identical to the distribution of point - like x - ray sources ( clark , in prep ) .",
    "this core of diffuse emission could be produced either from the cluster wind , which radiates x - rays mostly in the region where the colliding winds are thermalized @xcite , or from an unresolved population of pre - main sequence stars .",
    "however , between 2  and 5  ( 37 pc ) from the cluster core the diffuse x - ray flux attains a constant level @xmath0@xmath96 erg @xmath16 s@xmath2  arcmin@xmath93 ( tab .",
    "[ tab : spec ] ; fig .",
    "[ fig : diffimg ] ) , which is 23 times larger than is expected from the galactic plane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an expanding thermal plasma would exhibit a rapidly - declining temperature profile , yet the spectrum of this halo of diffuse emission is quite hard and lacks the line emission expected from a cooling plasma .",
    "this makes it tempting to interpret the diffuse halo as non - thermal particles that are accelerated in a large - scale outflow .",
    "therefore , although the luminosity of the diffuse x - ray emission from westerlund 1 is not surprising , the lack of line emission in the spectrum and broad spatial distribution of the diffuse x - rays is . to address this , in the following sections we quantify the probable contributions of pre - main - sequence stars , stellar winds , and supernovae to the x - ray emission from westerlund 1",
    "the non - thermal spectrum of the diffuse x - ray emission from westerlund 1 puts interesting constraints on the population of low - mass stars in the cluster .",
    "the average spectrum of the lightly - absorbed pre - main - sequence stars in orion can be qualitatively described as a two - temperature plasma with @xmath44=0.5 kev and @xmath55=3.3 kev , and with metal abundances of up to 10 times solar for s , ar , ca , and fe @xcite . in contrast , in our models for the diffuse emission from westerlund 1 , a @xmath5@xmath71 kev plasma contributes only 5% of the 28 kev diffuse x - ray flux , and the remaining hard flux does not exhibit the expected he - like fe line at 6.7 kev , placing an upper limit on the fe abundance of @xmath70.3 solar ( tab .",

    "our upper limit to the integrated x - ray luminosity of low - mass stars in westerlund 1 is @xmath7@xmath97 erg s@xmath2 , so we infer that westerlund 1 contains @xmath740,000 stars with masses between 0.3@xmath11@xmath10@xmath112@xmath8 .",
    "this number of low - mass stars is smaller than one would expect if one were to extrapolate from the number of massive , post - main - sequence stars in the cluster using a standard initial mass function @xcite .",
    "there are @xmath0150 stars brighter than @xmath105=21 within 5  of the center of westerlund 1 , the faintest of which have recently been identified as o7 main sequence stars that would have initial masses @xmath630 @xmath8   ( j. s. clark  in prep ) .",
    "the maximum initial mass of the stars remaining in the cluster is uncertain because there is no precise means to determine the initial masses of the supergiants and wr stars , but @xcite argue that it is probably in the range of 4050 @xmath8 .",
    "if we assume that the initial mass function can be described as a broken power law of the form @xmath106 , where @xmath107=2.3 for @xmath108@xmath1010.5@xmath8  and @xmath107=1.4 for 0.3@xmath11@xmath108@xmath110.5 @xmath8  @xcite , then if there are 150 stars with 30@xmath11@xmath108@xmath1150 @xmath8 , we would expect 100,000 stars with 0.3@xmath11@xmath10@xmath112 @xmath8 .",
    "this inferred lack of low - mass stars can be explained several ways .",
    "the slope of the initial mass function could be flat ( @xmath107@xmath72.1 ) , as has been inferred for ngc 3603 and the arches cluster based on infrared star counts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the mass function could be truncated at low masses ( @xmath10@xmath110.6@xmath8 ) , by analogy with the fact that @xmath10@xmath117@xmath8  stars appear to be depleted in the arches cluster @xcite .",
    "finally , the initial masses of the post - main sequence stars in westerlund 1 could span a much wider range of masses ( 2060@xmath8 ) than assumed in @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the mass function is truncated at low masses , the total mass of the cluster would not differ significantly from the estimate of @xmath109 @xmath8  in @xcite based on the un - modified kroupa form .",
    "however , if the mass function is flat , or the optically - detected stars had a wider range of initial masses , the total mass of the cluster would be only 40,000 - 70,000 @xmath8 . obviously , an accurate measurement of the mass function , and consequently the total mass , requires direct infrared observations of the low - mass stars in westerlund 1 .",
    "however , these x - ray observations provide a useful starting point .",
    "it is not clear whether stellar winds or supernovae are the dominant source of the diffuse x - ray emission from westerlund 1 , because it is at an age when both should contribute equally to its mechanical output ( e.g. , leitherer , robert , & drissen 1992 ) .",
    "individual stellar winds carry a power of @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the mass loss rate , and @xmath112 is the wind velocity .",
    "the wr stars dominate the mechanical output from stellar winds , with typical @xmath113 @xmath8  yr@xmath2 and @xmath114 km s@xmath2 , so that @xmath115 erg s@xmath2  @xcite . with at 24 wr stars in the cluster , the total mechanical energy output from winds is @xmath116 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "we can estimate the x - ray luminosity of the resulting cluster wind using the analytic solutions to the density and temperature that ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also stevens & hartwell 2003 ) derived for a wind expanding supersonically into the interstellar medium @xcite . within the radius of the cluster where the stars input their energy , the density is given by @xmath117",
    "( note that we used the supersonic solution with an adiabatic index @xmath118 for the original equation ) and the temperature by @xmath119 where @xmath17 is the number of stars , @xmath120 is the average mass loss rate of the stars , and @xmath121 is the radius within which the stars are contained and the winds are thermalized .",
    "if we use the values above for wr stars , assume @xmath17=24 , and take the radius of the cluster to be @xmath121=4 pc ( @xmath03at 5 kpc ) , then we find @xmath122=0.6 @xmath123 and @xmath124=4 kev .",
    "using any of the standard plasma models in xspec ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and converting @xmath122 and @xmath121 to an emission measure ( i.e. , @xmath125 ) we find a predicted @xmath126 erg s@xmath2  ( 28 kev ) .",
    "therefore , a cluster wind could in principle account for all of the diffuse x - rays from westerlund 1 .",
    "however , the cluster wind model is not able to account for the spatial distribution of the diffuse x - rays from westerlund 1 .",
    "a cluster wind would produce almost all of the diffuse x - ray emission within the core radius @xmath121 @xcite , whereas at 70% of the diffuse emission from westerlund 1 is part of a halo that extends out to at least 5   ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diffdist ] ) .",
    "if consider only the core of the diffuse emission as originating from stellar winds , then the cluster is underluminous by a factor of two .",
    "this result is particularly surprising given that the standard cluster wind model applied by @xcite to ngc 3603 , r136 , and ngc 346 predicted significantly _ less _ flux than is observed . in those cases , @xcite favored the hypothesis that cold material was being entrained in the wind . to reconcile our results for westerlund 1 to the cluster wind model",
    ", we would have to assume that enough cold material is entrained that the cluster wind no longer emits in the 28 kev bandpass .",
    "this requires that the plasma be cooled by a factor of @xmath010 , to @xmath70.4 kev .",
    "based on figure  1 in @xcite , we estimate that this would require that the mass of cold material input into the wind is twice that of the hot material , or roughly @xmath127 @xmath8  yr@xmath2 .",
    "the mass loss rates from the @xmath010 luminous blue variables , red supergiants , and yellow hypergiants , which should be @xmath11@xmath128 @xmath8  yr@xmath2 each ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , probably could not account for this large amount of cool mass . therefore , either there is a currently - unseen source of mass in westerlund 1 , or the stellar winds are not thermalized within the cluster and escape without radiating much .",
    "the presence of an isolated x - ray pulsar in westerlund 1 @xcite confirms that supernovae have occurred there .",
    "if we extrapolate an initial mass function with slope @xmath107=1.82.7 for @xmath10@xmath10130@xmath8  to higher masses , we expect that the cluster originally contained @xmath080150 stars with initial masses @xmath10150@xmath8  that have already undergone supernova . for the most massive stars ,",
    "this would have started when the cluster was about 3  myr old , so the average supernova rate over the last 1 myr should be on order one every 7,00013,000 yr . if each supernova had a kinetic energy of @xmath129 erg , then the average power released by supernovae is @xmath130 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "no obvious supernova remnant is present in our _ chandra _  image of westerlund 1 , but this is not surprising .",
    "we have examined images from the _ spitzer _ glimpse program ( r. indebetouw , private communication ) , and there is no evidence that dense gas or dust still surrounds westerlund 1 .",
    "therefore , westerlund 1 appears to have cleared away the ism for parsecs around .",
    "when a supernova occurs in such an evacuated cavity , a typical radio and x - ray remnant is not expected until the remnant encounters the boundaries of the bubble blown by the cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "whether the hard , possibly non - thermal emission from westerlund 1 is produced by supernovae is unclear .",
    "most supernova remnants produce thermal x - ray emission with strong lines , but a few are also non - thermal x - ray sources .",
    "for example , rcw 86 and sn 1006 exhibit non - thermal filaments near the outer boundary of the shock , and thermal emission in the interior ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ax j1843.8@xmath200352 and g346.3 - 0.5 exhibit non - thermal emission almost exclusively throughout the remnant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , there is not a satisfactory explanation as to why a small fraction of supernova remnants produce non - thermal emission , so the issue remains unresolved for westerlund 1 .      in principle ,",
    "non - thermal particles can be produced either in supernova remnants ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or in colliding stellar winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "once they are produced , inverse - compton scattering should dominate synchrotron losses by a large factor in westerlund 1 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio of the energy - loss rates is given by the ratio of the background radiation to the magnetic energy density .",
    "the energy density of the stellar light from the ob and wr stars in westerlund 1 is approximately @xmath131 where @xmath132 the luminosity of the cluster . for synchrotron losses to be important",
    ", magnetic fields would have to have an energy of @xmath133 , which corresponds to @xmath1340.4 mgauss .",
    "this is much stronger than the microgauss fields generally assumed for the interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so inverse - compton scattering is probably the dominant loss mechanism for non - thermal particles .",
    "if the non - thermal x - ray emission is produced by inverse - compton scattering , the energy requirements are modest .",
    "non - thermal particles would only need to be replenished at a rate sufficient to balance the x - ray luminosity , @xmath135 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , inverse - compton scattering photons from optical and uv energies ( @xmath136 ev ) into the x - ray band ( @xmath137 kev ) only requires electrons with @xmath138 , or energies of 620 mev .",
    "these particle energies are rather small . for comparison ,",
    "if the magnetic field in westerlund 1 has a strength of only 10 @xmath139gauss , producing non - thermal synchrotron radio emission like that seen from 30 dor c @xcite requires electrons with energies of a few gev .",
    "therefore , detecting diffuse , non - thermal radio emission from a star cluster like westerlund 1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would provide a much more interesting constraint on the maximum energies of particles than detecting non - thermal x - rays .",
    "the interferometric radio observations in the literature @xcite would have resolved out arcminute - scale diffuse radio emission , so single - dish observations are necessary to determine whether higher - energy particles are also produced by the cluster .",
    "we have identified diffuse x - ray emission within 5  of the core of westerlund 1 with a modest luminosity of @xmath3 erg s@xmath2   ( 28 kev ) .",
    "this low luminosity is puzzling , because unresolved pre - main - sequence stars , a thermalized cluster wind , or a series of supernova remnants would each be expected to produce at least this much x - ray emission .",
    "therefore , one or all of these mechanisms is not producing nearly as much x - ray flux as would be expected based on comparison with other star clusters and with theoretical calculations .",
    "the lack of a 6.7 kev he - like fe line accompanying the hard 48 kev continuum implies that no more than 30% of the diffuse emission is produced by young stellar objects .",
    "therefore , we infer that there are @xmath740,000 stars with masses between 0.3 and 2 @xmath8 , which is significantly fewer than the @xmath109 stars one would expect from extrapolating the number of massive , optically - identified stars to lower masses using a standard initial mass function @xcite . moreover , this limit is conservative , because in computing it we have assumed that the line emission from the low - mass stars would be produced by a solar abundance of iron .",
    "if we had assumed that iron had an abundance several times the solar value , as it does in the spectra of stars in orion @xcite , then only a few percent of the diffuse 28 kev flux could be produced by pre - main sequence stars .",
    "in contrast , the lack of iron emission in the spectrum is consistent with a similar under - abundance of iron that is observed in x - ray spectra of individual o and wr stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , if the o and wr star winds collide and thermalize as expected , they would form a pressure - driven cluster wind that would expand and cool rapidly @xcite .",
    "such a wind would not radiate in the x - ray band outside of the cluster core , and therefore can not explain the broad halo of emission between @xmath03  and 5 .    instead , the halo of x - rays may represent non - thermal particles accelerated by the colliding stellar winds or by supernova remnants .",
    "however , the energy lost in x - rays represents less than @xmath9 of the kinetic energy released by stellar winds and supernova remnants .",
    "the rest of the energy either ( 1 ) emerges below 2 kev where our observations are insensitive , ( 2 ) dissipates beyond the bounds of our image ( @xmath07 from the cluster core ) when the cluster wind or supernova remnants impact the ism , or ( 3 ) escapes the galactic plane , enriching the intergalactic medium with metals .",
    "we plan to address the second option in the next year , by observing a larger area around the cluster ( @xmath015 ) with _ xmm - newton_.    we thank e. feigelson and an anonymous referee for comments and suggestions that improved this manuscript .",
