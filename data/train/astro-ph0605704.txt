    "from decoupling to present time , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons have been traveling almost freely through a homogeneous and isotropic background universe with small perturbations .",
    "taking into account the main results from the analysis of the first year wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) data , which were presented in @xcite , it is assumed : ( i ) a gaussian distribution of adiabatic energy density fluctuations with zeldovich spectrum , ( ii ) a currently accelerated expansion with reduced hubble constant @xmath2 ( @xmath3 being the hubble constant in units of @xmath4 ) , ( iii ) a cosmological constant with density parameter @xmath5 producing the current acceleration , and ( iv ) cold dark matter ( baryonic matter ) with density parameter @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) ; hence , the total matter density parameter is @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , a realization of the so - called concordance model is assumed and , then , the cmbfast code @xcite is used to get the linearly evolved power spectrum , @xmath9 , of the scalar energy density fluctuations , which is defined by the relation @xmath10 .",
    "this spectrum is normalized with the condition @xmath11 to have the required density of galaxy clusters @xcite .    along this paper ,",
    "units are chosen in such a way that the speed of light is @xmath12 and the gravitation constant is @xmath13 .",

    "as it is well known , a good approximation to @xmath29 can be obtained by calculating this integral along the background null geodesic corresponding to @xmath30 , which obeys the equation @xmath31 where @xmath32^{1/2 } } \\ .\\ ] ] in the flat universe with cosmological constant we are considering , linear , mildly non - linear , and strongly non - linear structures contribute to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ rtp ] ) .",
    "indeed , this integral allows us to estimate the anisotropy produced by the total time varying peculiar gravitational potential of the universe .",
    "this anisotropy could be considered as an unique effect ; nevertheless , the contributions to the integral due to linear and non - linear structure evolution are usually called the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) and the rees - sciama ( rs ) effect , respectively . some comments about this distinction",
    "seem to be worthwhile . during linear evolution ,",
    "the peculiar potential can be written in the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the initial potential ( taken at decoupling time ) and @xmath35 is the linear growth function for the density contrast . at any time",
    ", the total peculiar potential , @xmath36 , can be splitted as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the part of the potential properly due to nonlinear evolution .",
    "after substitution in eq .",
    "( [ rtp ] ) and integration until present time , the first term of the r.h.s . of this equation",
    "gives the isw effect , whereas the second one is the source of the rs effect .",
    "equation ( [ sepiden ] ) leads to a consistent definition of both effects ( the addition is the total integrated gravitational effect ) . before the beginning of the nonlinear regime ,",
    "function @xmath38 takes on negligible second order values and only the isw anisotropy can be significant . during the nonlinear regime",
    ", the first term continues contributing to the isw effect and the second term produces the rs anisotropy .",
    "let us now study the ratio @xmath39 to discuss in more detail isw anisotropy production in the concordance model , in which , function @xmath40 can be written as follows ( in terms of @xmath20 ) : @xmath41^{1/2 } \\int_{0}^{x } \\left [ \\frac { 2}{y } + y^{2 } \\right]^{-3/2 } dy   \\",
    ",   \\label{ll2}\\ ] ] where @xmath42^{1/3 } ( 1+z)^{-1 } \\ .",
    "\\label{ll3}\\ ] ] with the appropriate normalization factor , function @xmath40 is almost identical to the scale factor @xmath19 for @xmath43 , whereas it is greater than this factor for @xmath44 .",
    "this behaviour is shown in fig .",
    "( [ figu0 ] ) , where we see that function @xmath45 is very close to ( greater than ) unity for @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "two periods can be then distinguished : in the first one ( @xmath43 ) , the term @xmath33 is almost constant and no significant isw anisotropy is generated . in the second period ( @xmath44 ) , the potential @xmath33 varies and the isw effect is produced .",
    "these facts can be easily understood .",
    "for @xmath43 , vacuum energy is subdominant and the concordance model approximately evolves as a flat universe without cosmological constant ; in which , it is well known that no isw is generated because the relation @xmath46 is satisfied .",
    "all the isw effect is produced when vacuum energy plays a significant role in the evolution of the universe ; namely , for @xmath47 ; therefore , in the concordance model , the isw and the rs effects are both produced at low redshifts . only a small contribution to the rs effect is produced at @xmath48 as a result of the first stages of non - linear evolution .",
    "the main part of the rs effect and all the isw anisotropy are simulataneously generated at redshifts @xmath47 .",
    "the isw ( rs ) effect dominates for small ( large ) enough multipoles ( see next sections ) .",
    "since the location of the first peak of the cmb angular power spectrum indicates that the background universe is almost flat and , in such a case , the isw effect only appears in the presence of vacuum energy ( cosmological constant ) , any detection of the isw effect could be considered as an indirect detection of vacuum energy .",
    "since the largest isw multipoles correspond to small @xmath49 values with large cosmic variances , a direct detection based on the analysis of cmb maps becomes problematic @xcite ; nevertheless , ten years ago , @xcite proposed an indirect detection method which is based on the estimate of cross - correlations between the cmb maps and tracers of the matter density distribution at @xmath50 ( risponsable for the isw anisotropy ) .",
    "many papers have been devoted to try this indirect detection ( @xcite ) ; nevertheless , in the present paper , the isw effect is only considered with the essential aim of estimating its contribution to our maps of the integrated gravitational effect , which are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ rtp ] ) and appropriate numerical techniques ( see below ) .",
    "since the isw contribution is proved to be small enough ( see next sections ) , our maps can be considered as approximated simulations of the rs effect ; by this reason , these maps are hereafter called rs maps and the spectra extracted from them are considered as an approximation to the rs spectrum .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : appropriate comments on the isw effect are given in section 2 .",
    "the numerical methods used to simulate maps of the rs effect are described in section 3 . the rs angular power spectrum obtained from small maps",
    "is described in section 4 , where the importance of the smallness of the maps ( as a source of uncertainty ) is discussed in detail .",
    "next section deals with the estimation of both reduced m - correlations and deviations from gaussianity and , finally , section 6 contains a summary of conclusions and a general discussion .",
    "in a flat background with cosmological constant , the angular power spectrum of the isw effect depends on various parameters .",
    "the values of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are particularly important .",
    "this spectrum has been previously calculated in various cases , see , e.g. @xcite . here , it is calculated for the cosmological model and parameters fixed in the introduction .",
    "the @xmath54 quantities of the isw effect can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56    \\frac { d } { d\\lambda } \\left [ ( 1+z)d_{1}(z ) \\right ] d\\lambda   \\ , \\label{isw2}\\ ] ] @xmath57 being the spherical bessel function of order @xmath58 , and @xmath59^{2 } \\ , \\ ] ] where function @xmath60 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ ll2 ] ) and ( [ ll3 ] ) .",
    "the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ isw1 ] ) and ( [ isw2 ] ) have been numerically calculated to get the required spectrum .",
    "results are presented in fig .",
    "( [ figu1 ] ) , where quantity @xmath61^{1/2 } $ ] in @xmath62 ( used along the paper to describe the angular power spectrum ) is displayed in the @xmath49 interval [ 2,700 ] .",
    "our estimation , as well as previous ones ( see e.g. @xcite ) , leads to two main conclusions : ( 1 ) the most important part of the isw effect is produced by very large spatial scales ( small @xmath63 values ) contributing to small multipoles , and ( 2 ) the contribution to this effect strongly decreases as the spatial scale does .",
    "for the parameters we have assumed , the @xmath64 value corresponding to @xmath65 is @xmath66 and , moreover , quantity @xmath64 rapidly decreases as @xmath49 increases reaching a value close to @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "these values are to be compared with those extracted from our numerically simulated maps . as a technical requirement associated to ray - tracing ( see below ) , our maps are produced by the total time varying peculiar potential due to all the scales smaller than @xmath69 , which are evolved by n - body simulations from redshift @xmath70 to present time ; hence , all the isw effect produced ( at @xmath71 , see fig .",
    "( [ figu0 ] ) ) by these scales is included in the resulting maps .",
    "the effect produced by scales greater than @xmath72 must be independently calculated .",
    "is it a pure isw effect ?",
    "a few considerations about linearity are useful to answer this question .    in order to discuss about linearity in detail ,",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) of the relative mass fluctuations inside a sphere having a present radius of @xmath73 ( randomly placed in our flat universe ) is estimated .",
    "condition @xmath74 implies that number @xmath75 is also the comoving radius of the sphere .",
    "this rms value is @xmath76 , with @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the window function of the r - sphere [ @xmath79 with @xmath80 ; see @xcite ] .",
    "numerical calculations based on these formulae lead to the @xmath81 values presented in fig .",
    "[ figu2 ] . from this figure",
    "it follows that , for the chosen normalization of @xmath9 and the comoving radius @xmath82 , the @xmath83 value is close to @xmath84 ; hence , it can be assumed ( standard point of view ) that regions having a comoving diameter greater than @xmath85 can be treated as linearly evolving zones .",
    "the scale @xmath86 , used along this paper , evolves in the linear regime with @xmath87 ; hence , scales greater than @xmath72 would produce a pure isw effect to be separately estimated with appropriate linear techniques . the isw effect produced by all the scales smaller than @xmath72",
    "is included in our maps and , obviously , it is smaller than the total isw effect ( see fig .",
    "[ figu1 ] and previous comments ) .",
    "rs is a pure gravitational effect and , consequently , only the dominant dark matter component is considered , whereas the sub - dominant baryonic component is neglected . on account of these facts , the formation and evolution of non - linear cosmological structures can be described by using n - body simulations with appropriate boxes and resolutions . in the pm simulations we use here @xcite ,",
    "the peculiar potential satisfies the equation @xcite : @xmath88 the universe is assumed to be covered by simulation boxes and , consequently , it is periodic . as it was pointed out by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "periodicity effects magnify lens deformations and , in general , gravitational anisotropies as the rs effect .",
    "various techniques ( ray - tracing methods ) have been used to avoid this magnification , for example , @xcite averaged the temperature contrasts of many rays , but then , they found a map with too large pixels , from which , the multipoles corresponding to @xmath89 could not be obtained . another method based on multiple plane projections",
    "was proposed and applied to study week lensing by cosmological structures ( see @xcite for a detailed description ) .",
    "afterwards , @xcite designed the `` tiling '' ray tracing procedure , in which , independent simulations with appropriate boxes and resolutions tile the photon trajectories . finally , another method based on the existence of preferred directions and on the use of an appropriate cutoff",
    "was recently proposed and applied ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the required cutoff",
    ", the fourier modes corresponding to spatial scales larger than a given one ( @xmath90 ) are eliminated from the peculiar gravitational potential .",
    "the @xmath90 value is chosen in such a way that : ( a ) the cutoff eliminates all the spatial scales which are too large to be well described in the simulation box , and ( b ) after the cutoff is performed , cmb photons cross neighbouring boxes through statistically independent regions .",
    "this cutoff is only performed in the output peculiar gravitational potential with the essential aim of calculating the integral in eq .",
    "( [ rtp ] ) ; however , all the spatial scales allowed by the box size are taken into account in the n - body simulation .",
    "our ray - tracing method is a very good choice presenting some advantages with respect to other techniques ( see @xcite ) , e.g. , there are no discontinuities at the crossing points between successive boxes , the computational cost is moderated , and so on .    in order to study the rs effect",
    ", we develop the same type of n - body simulations which were used , in @xcite , to deal with lensed maps of the cmb . in this way ,",
    "various maps of the relative temperature variations due to the rs effect are created and analyzed , and the dependence of the results on various parameters involved in the simulations and also in their statistical analysis is then discussed .",
    "most maps are regularly pixelised , but some maps based on healpix ( _ hierarchical equal area isolatitude pixelisation of the sphere _ , see @xcite ) are also considered .",
    "taking into account that the box size used in the mentioned n - body simulations ( see @xcite for details ) is @xmath91 , and also that the main part of the rs effect is assumed to be produced at redshift @xmath92 ( see below ) , the size of the resulting rs maps appears to be close to @xmath93 .",
    "simulation boxes cover a periodic universe and , for the direction @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are spherical coordinates defined with respect to the box edges ) , the cmb photons cross around @xmath98 boxes before passing through the region where they were initially located ( in the first box ) .",
    "it can be verified that these boxes cover the trajectory of the cmb photons from the redshift @xmath99 to present time , and also that these photons cross successive boxes through independent regions separated by a distance close to @xmath100 .",
    "the cutoff is performed at the scale @xmath101 with @xmath102 ( in agreement with previous comments about the scales involved in our simulations ) .    along the paper",
    "we develop three types of n - body simulations in boxes of @xmath103 ( integer and even l ) : low resolution ( lr ) simulations involving @xmath104 cells per edge and @xmath105 particles ( @xmath106 cell size and @xmath107 time steps ) , intermediate resolution ( ir ) simulations using l cells per edge and @xmath108 particles ( @xmath109 cell size and @xmath110 time steps ) , and high resolution ( hr ) simulations with @xmath111 cells per edge and @xmath112 particles ( @xmath113 cell size and @xmath114 time steps ) .",
    "figure ( [ figucolour ] ) shows a rs map which has been obtained with our ray - tracing method and a hr simulation of structure .",
    "its look is promising , but the correlations appearing in this type of maps must be estimated to get objective conclusions .",
    "it is done in next sections .    for any observation direction @xmath30 , function @xmath115",
    "must be calculated in a set of points to estimate the integral in eq .",
    "( [ rtp ] ) .",
    "we have chosen equidistant points ( on the corresponding background geodesic ) separated by a comoving distance equal to the cell size .",
    "each of these points has a comoving position vector @xmath116 , and the photon passes by this position at time @xmath117 .",
    "point @xmath118 is placed inside a certain @xmath118-cell of the computational grid and time @xmath117 belongs to some interval [ @xmath119 , where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are two successive times of the n - body simulation , at which , the peculiar potential @xmath36 is found at any grill node .",
    "the potential at point @xmath118 is calculated at times @xmath122 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath123 .",
    "the calculation at any of these times is performed by means of a suitable 3d interpolation , which uses the potential in the vertices of the @xmath118-cell and in those of the neighbouring ones . from the resulting potential at the above four times , the partial derivative @xmath115 is finally calculated with an appropriated numerical method . for each type of n - body simulations ( lr , ir or hr ) , various methods for spatial interpolation and also for the numerical calculation of time derivatives",
    "have been tried .",
    "the final results do not significantly depend on the chosen methods because these results depend much more on the simulation resolution ( see comments on fig .",
    "( [ figu4 ] ) given below ) .",
    "two types of spatial interpolations have been considered : ( i ) an standard 3d linear interpolation using the potential in the eight nodes of the @xmath118 cell , and ( ii ) a 3d interpolation based on the use of splines along each direction ; in this case , four vertices located in the @xmath118-cell and in their neighbouring ones are considered for interpolations in the directions of the box edges ; results from both interpolations are very similar ; relative differences between the @xmath54 coefficients extracted from the maps obtained with the two interpolations are smaller than @xmath124 for any @xmath49 . also time derivatives based on different numbers of points , @xmath125 ,",
    "have been performed , but the results are almost identical in all cases because @xmath36 is a very smooth function of @xmath126 in any node of the simulation grid ( see @xcite ) . in short , a 3d linear interpolation in space and a standard derivative based on two times @xmath120 and @xmath121 suffice to get good maps of the rs effect .",
    "various methods have been also used to perform the integral in eq .",
    "( [ rtp ] ) : trapezoidal , simpson , and so on .",
    "results are almost identical in all cases .",
    "all these comments show that our ray - tracing procedure is a robust numerical method , which leads to rs maps having almost the same properties for a wide set of numerical techniques ( interpolations , derivatives and integrations ) .",
    "since we are concerned with small squared regularly pixelised maps , the power spectrum estimator described in @xcite applies . although this estimator is used as the basic one along the paper , some results are compared with those of the code anafast included in the healpix package .",
    "the basic estimator is first used to analyze @xmath127 rs maps obtained from ir simulations with @xmath128 .",
    "figure [ figu3 ] shows the resulting angular power spectra ( @xmath64 ) for three appropriate choices of the cutoff : @xmath129 , @xmath98 , and @xmath130 .",
    "differences between the @xmath64 values corresponding to the solid ( dotted ) and dotted ( dashed ) lines are produced by scales between @xmath129 and @xmath85 ( @xmath98 and @xmath130 ) .",
    "the relation @xmath131 is satisfied and , according to previous comments ( see section 2 ) , the isw effect can not produce these spectra ; therefore , scales between @xmath72 and @xmath130 seem to produce a certain rees - sciama effect , which is only possible if they become non - linear enough in our simulation boxes .",
    "the question is : are the scales between @xmath132 and @xmath72 well described in our simulations ? in order to answer , it should be taken into account that the evolution of the scales under consideration depend on n - body simulation characteristics as resolution and box size ; indeed , the greater the n - body resolution , the better ( more realistic ) the description of all the spatial scales and , in particular , the description of the scales between @xmath132 and @xmath72 .",
    "we can say then that part of the non - linear behaviour of these scales is due to low resolution ( see next paragraph for more discussion ) .    for a cutoff at @xmath72 and a fixed box size @xmath128 ,",
    "the angular power spectrum of the rs maps has been calculated for hr , ir , and lr simulations ; namely , for different space and mass resolutions .",
    "the resulting spectra are displayed in fig .",
    "[ figu4 ] , where we see that the greater the resolution the smaller the amplitude of the rs effect . taking into account fig .",
    "[ figu3 ] this behaviour of the amplitude is not surprising because , as resolution increases , the evolution of the scales between @xmath129 and @xmath130 is better described and masses concentrate more and more on smaller and smaller scales . taking into account",
    "that the separation between the solid and dashed lines is greater than that of the dashed and dotted lines , it seems that , although the spectra of fig .",
    "[ figu4 ] depend on resolution , they tend to a certain spectrum located below the dotted line and close to it ; hence , this line gives an upper limit to the true spectrum .",
    "the difference between the true spectrum and the upper limit ( dotted line ) is expected to be small and , consequently , the dotted line can be considered as our best estimation of the rs angular power spectrum . in spite of this fact ,",
    "there are systematic errors in this spectrum associated to the smallness of our simulated maps .",
    "these errors are analyzed below    the spectra of fig .",
    "[ figu4 ] have been obtained for an initial redshift @xmath133 , but other initial redshifts have been tried .",
    "[ figu5 ] shows the spectra obtained from initial redshifts of 5.2 , 10.2 and 15.2 . in the three cases ,",
    "ir simulations have been used and the size of the simulated maps is @xmath127 . in order to maintain the map area for the three initial redshifts , the size of the simulation box ( and accordingly the resolution ) has been varied .",
    "the assumed box size ( n - body resolution ) slightly increases ( decreases ) as the initial redshift grows .",
    "figure [ figu5 ] shows oscillations in @xmath64 whose amplitude increases as @xmath134 does . in spite of these unexplained oscillations ,",
    "the resulting spectra are rather similar in the three cases and , as it follows from this figure , the choice of the initial redshift @xmath135 is the simplest one leading to a good estimate of @xmath64 without spurious oscillations .",
    "the spectra obtained from our small non - gaussian rs maps have systematic errors which are now approximately estimated . in order to perform this estimation ,",
    "we begin with the analysis of gaussian maps of the same size and , then , results are considered as an approximated estimate of the errors associated to the non - gaussian rs simulations .",
    "this procedure seems to be reasonable taking into account that deviations from gaussianity of the rs maps do not seem to be dramatic ( see our discussion in section 5 ) . as it is well known , the relative errors of the @xmath136 quantities extracted from a gaussian map is @xmath137^{1/2 } f_{sky}^{-1/2 } $ ] , where @xmath138 is the ratio between the map area and that of the full sky @xcite .",
    "according to this formula , the relative errors corresponding to @xmath139 gaussian maps range between @xmath140 and @xmath141 as @xmath49 takes on the values of the interval @xmath142 . for @xmath127 ( @xmath143 ) maps these errors increase ( decrease ) by a factor @xmath144 .",
    "these relative errors are so large that one could think that gaussian maps of dominant anisotropy ( and also our simulated maps ) are not useful at all ; however , when @xmath145 quantities are extracted from one of the mentioned gaussian maps , the errors lead to a oscillatory angular spectrum which changes from @xmath49 to @xmath146 ; in other words , the resulting spectrum has high frequency oscillations which can be eliminated by means of suitable averages .",
    "these averages are performed during ( after ) the @xmath136 estimations when the method proposed in @xcite ( anafast ) is used .",
    "the final averaged spectra are meaningful in a certain interval of @xmath49 values . in order to define this interval ,",
    "@xmath127 maps of the cmb dominant anisotropy have been simulated by using : the angular power spectrum given by cmbfast ( in the model assumed here ) and a map making method based on the fast fourier transform @xcite .",
    "the resulting maps are analyzed with two different power spectrum estimators . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ figu6 ] , the solid line is the cmbfast spectrum used as input in the simulated maps , the dashed line is the spectrum extracted from the maps by using the power spectrum estimator described in @xcite and , finally , the dotted line has been obtained using anafast ( see above ) to analyze an equatorial healpix map obtained from our uniformly pixelised one .",
    "both estimators give very similar spectra which can be considered as a rather good estimate of the true spectrum for @xmath147 .",
    "maps are too small to get the spectrum for @xmath148 and , furthermore , for @xmath149 , the signal is too weak and , then , numerical and statistical noise become comparable to it . the middle and bottom panels of fig . [",
    "figu6 ] have the same structure as the top panel ; however , in the middle ( bottom ) panel the angular size of the maps is @xmath139 ( @xmath143 ) . comparing the panels of fig .",
    "[ figu6 ] , one concludes that the more extended the maps , the better the resulting spectra and the wider the @xmath49 interval where the spectra are good enough . in the case of the rs effect studied with hr simulations , the size of our simulation boxes ( @xmath128 ) and , consequently , the angular size of the resulting maps ( @xmath127 ) can not be freely increased because any significant increment would lead to a problematic decrease of the n - body simulation resolution , nevertheless , if the above results corresponding to gaussian maps are applied as an approximation in the presence of deviations from gaussianity , our @xmath127 maps should suffice to get a rough , but useful , estimate of the rs spectrum in a wide @xmath58 interval .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by a direct study of rs maps presented in the next paragraph .    in order to have direct information about the quality of the spectra associated to @xmath127 rs maps ,",
    "two tests have been performed . in the first one , maps of this angular size have been obtained from lr simulations with @xmath128 and , then , the angular power spectrum extracted from these maps ( which is presented in the dashed - dotted line of fig . [ figu7 ] ) is compared with that obtained from lr simulations with @xmath150 which lead to @xmath139 rs maps ( dashed line of the same figure ) .",
    "since both simulations have the same resolution , differences in the resulting spectra are due to the difference between the angular size of the maps .",
    "the comparison of the dashed - dotted and dashed lines of fig .",
    "[ figu7 ] shows that , in the @xmath127 maps , the spectrum is slightly underestimated for @xmath151 and overestimated for @xmath152 .",
    "the second test is identical to the first one except for the resolution of the involved simulations .",
    "the @xmath127 maps are obtained with ir simulations and @xmath128 , and the maps whose angular size is @xmath139 are created with ir simulations in boxes with @xmath150 ; the corresponding spectra are displayed by the solid and dotted lines of fig .",
    "[ figu7 ] , respectively .",
    "the comparison of these spectra indicates that , for the smallest maps , the resulting spectrum is underestimated ( overestimated ) for @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "furthermore the maxima of the dashed - dotted and solid lines appear as a result of the overestimations and they disappear in the case of our most extended maps ( see the dotted and dashed lines ) .",
    "unfortunately , hr simulations can not be used to perform a third test similar to the previous ones ( too great computational cost of hr simulations with @xmath150 ) , nevertheless , previous discussion strongly suggests that , also in the case of @xmath127 rs maps generated with hr simulations , the spectrum ( dotted line of fig .",
    "[ figu4 ] ) should be underestimated and overestimated as in the first and second tests ( see the weak maximum observed in that dotted line ) ; therefore , for @xmath155 , the @xmath156 quantities corresponding to @xmath139 hr maps should be smaller than those extracted from @xmath127 hr maps ( dotted line of fig . [ figu4 ] ) . in other words",
    ", the smallness of the maps leads to an overestimation of the angular power spectrum for large @xmath49 values .",
    "previous discussion about the @xmath156 uncertainties associated to both n - body resolution ( fig .",
    "[ figu4 ] ) and map size ( fig .",
    "[ figu7 ] ) can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) for @xmath49 values between @xmath157 and @xmath158 , the spectrum @xmath156 slightly depends on the map size ( see fig .",
    "[ figu7 ] ) ; however , its dependence on n - body resolution ( see fig .",
    "[ figu4 ] ) is important ; hence , the @xmath156 value corresponding to @xmath159 essentially depends on resolution . from the visual analysis of fig .",

    "this number follows from a qualitative study of figs .",
    "[ figu4 ] and [ figu7 ] , ( 3 ) on account of points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the dotted line of fig .",
    "[ figu4 ] appears to be an upper limit to the rs spectrum , but it can be considered , in practice , as an useful rough estimation of the true spectrum .",
    "the most important point is that the resulting spectrum has been obtained from fully nonlinear dark matter evolution ( without approximating techniques o models ) , and ( 4 ) more resolution and more extended maps are necessary to get a more accurate rs spectrum .",
    "various reduced correlation functions are estimated and then deviations from gaussianity are analyzed .",
    "the correlations associated to n directions ( or n points on the last scattering surface ) are estimated for @xmath1 . given a map of the variable @xmath163 , and @xmath164 directions ,",
    "the reduced angular correlations are : @xmath165 where the average is over many statistical realizations .",
    "correlations depend on the relative positions of the chosen directions ; hence , for cmb and rs maps , they depend on the figures that these directions draw on the last scattering surface . in this paper",
    "we have used the sets of directions displayed in fig .",
    "[ figu8 ] , where the basic correlation angle , @xmath166 , is that subtended by the two directions of the case @xmath167 . in gaussian statistics",

    "our rs simulated maps are not gaussian and we are interested in deviations from gaussianity .",
    "even correlations can be used to estimate these deviations as follows : ( a ) extract the @xmath169 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 correlations from the simulated maps , ( b ) use the extracted @xmath169 correlation to calculate @xmath178 , and @xmath179 functions assuming gaussianity , namely , using eqs .",
    "( [ cg4])([cg6 ] ) and , ( c ) compare @xmath176 and @xmath177 correlations with functions @xmath178 and @xmath179 , respectively .",
    "differences between @xmath176 and @xmath178 as well as between @xmath177 and @xmath179 measure deviations from gaussianity . furthermore ,",
    "odd correlations vanish in the gaussian case and , consequently , if at least one of the correlations @xmath180 and @xmath181 ( for the configurations of fig .",

    ", it is now proved that the methods proposed above to detect deviations from gaussianity based on the use of even correlations work . in order to do that ,",
    "these methods are first applied to cmb maps gaussian by construction having either the same sizes as our simulated rs maps or larger ones ; in this way , small gaussian maps are characterized and , then , deviations of the rs maps with respect to this characterization point out a certain level of non - gaussianity .",
    "we begin with @xmath127 gaussian cmb maps .",
    "some correlations extracted from these maps are displayed in the panels of fig .",
    "[ figu9 ] .",
    "the dashed ( dashed - dotted ) line of the top panel exhibits the @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) correlations ( see above ) , whereas the same lines of the bottom panel display @xmath185 and @xmath186 correlations . since the @xmath127 maps are too small , correlations extracted from them are not the true correlations ( which could be obtained from a large set of big maps ) and , consequently , in spite of gaussianity , functions @xmath183 and @xmath184 slightly separate ( compare dashed and dashed - dotted lines in the top panel of fig .  [ figu9 ] ) .",
    "the same occurs for the correlations @xmath185 and @xmath186 ( compare dashed and dashed - dotted lines in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "it has been verified that for @xmath143 maps , the corresponding lines are closer than in fig .",
    "[ figu10 ] .",

    "it is worthwhile to notice that , although the correlations @xmath187 , @xmath183 and @xmath185 obtained from small maps are not the true correlations , they allow us to verify the gaussian behaviour described above , which can be applied to detect deviations from gaussianity .",
    "even correlations extracted from @xmath127 and @xmath139 rs maps are now analyzed . in order to do that , the study described in the last paragraph ( for cmb maps ) is repeated for rs maps .",
    "results are also presented in figs .",
    "[ figu9 ] and [ figu10 ] ; in which solid and dotted lines are used to represent the same correlations given by the dashed - dotted and dashed lines of the same figures ( see above ) . from the comparison of the solid and dotted lines",
    "one easily concludes that : ( i ) for @xmath127 maps ( fig .",
    "[ figu9 ] ) , these lines separate for @xmath188 . since this separation is comparable to that corresponding to gaussian cmb small maps ( dashed - dotted and dashed lines ) , it does not point out any deviation from gaussianity , and ( ii ) for @xmath139 maps ( fig .",
    "[ figu10 ] ) , the separation between solid and dotted lines is much greater than that of the cmb gaussian maps with the same size ( dashed dotted and dashed lines of fig .",
    "[ figu10 ] ) .",
    "it occurs for all the angular scales we have represented , which include the scales corresponding to @xmath189 , for which ou best estimation of the rs spectrum ( dotted line of fig .  [ figu4 ] ) has been obtained . this result ( great separation )",
    "proves that the rs maps are not gaussian because , in the case of gaussianity , the separation of the solid and dotted curves corresponding to @xmath139 maps must be smaller than the separation corresponding to @xmath127 maps ( gaussian behaviour defined above ) .",
    "odd correlations have been also considered .",
    "maps of @xmath127 and @xmath139 squared degrees have been used to study these correlations . in the case of cmb gaussian simulations , the general method ( see above ) for estimating functions @xmath190 and @xmath191 has been applied using @xmath0 small cmb maps .",
    "different @xmath0 values have been considered .",
    "results do not converge as @xmath0 increases because the true odd correlations vanish and , consequently , the functions @xmath190 and @xmath191 extracted from @xmath0 simulated gaussian cmb maps are pure errors for any @xmath0 .",
    "this complete absence of convergence characterizes small gaussian maps for any size . in the case of rs small maps with any of the above sizes",
    ", it has been verified that the @xmath190 and @xmath191 correlations extracted from a number @xmath164 of these maps do not converge as m - increases ( as it occurs for gaussian maps ) ; this means that we have not been able to detect the small odd correlations associated to the rs effect ( see next section for more discussion ) .",
    "in this paper , an improved version of the numerical methods used in @xcite is applied to study the rs effect . our main improvements : preferred direction and appropriate cutoff were described in @xcite and successfully applied in @xcite .",
    "these new elements make negligible the magnification of the rs and lens effects due to the spatial periodicity of the simulated universe , which is covered by identical simulation boxes .",
    "the present size of these boxes must range between @xmath192 and @xmath193 . only in this way , good n - body simulations with large enough resolutions",
    "can be obtained using our pm code ; as a result of this size restriction , we are constrained to work with small maps of the rs effect having sizes between @xmath194 and @xmath195 ( see section 3 ) . since the correlations obtained from these small maps are expected to have important uncertainties , an exhaustive study about the accuracy and significance of these correlations is developed .",
    "furthermore , methods specially designed for detecting deviations with respect to gaussianity ( using the correlations of small maps ) are described and applied .",
    "the analysis of small cmb gaussian maps of dominant anisotropy ( cmbfast angular power spectrum , see section 4 ) has been basic in order to study both power spectrum estimations and non - gaussianity detection .",
    "the following studies have been developed : ( 1 ) the @xmath136 quantities extracted from gaussian cmb maps ( for different sizes ) have been compared with those used in their simulation ; in this way , the interval ( @xmath196,@xmath197 ) where the recovered angular power spectrum is good enough ( from a qualitative point of view ) has been estimated ( see fig .  [ figu6 ] of section 4 ) , the existence of this interval has been interpreted taking into account the concept of sample variance and , ( 2 ) the method described in section 5 to look for deviations with respect to gaussianity from even correlations has been applied to analyze cmb maps with distinct sizes and , thus , gaussian maps have been characterized , which has been basic for further researches about deviations from gaussianity .",
    "the interval ( @xmath196,@xmath197 ) depends on the map size ( see section 4 ) and the @xmath54 quantities have been calculated for various of these sizes",
    ". the larger the size of the rs map , the wider this interval .",
    "more extended maps are necessary to get the angular power spectrum for @xmath198 , and more extended maps and greater resolutions are needed to find this spectrum in the case @xmath199 ; namely , for very small angular scales .",
    "there is the opinion that the rs effect could produce some feature in the angular power spectrum at small enough angular scales , by this reason , our main project in this field is the use of p3 m and ap3 m n - body codes to get resolutions as high as possible in large enough boxes . in spite of this plan",
    ", we are skeptical about the existence of the mentioned feature because the rs effect is produced by the time derivative of the peculiar potential , which seems to be rather well estimated with the effective resolution of @xmath109 corresponding to the dotted line of fig .",
    "[ figu4 ] , in which , there is no any trace of incipient features at large @xmath49 values ; nevertheless , it must be recognized that , for these large values , the uncertainties in our spectrum are maximum ( superimposition of the overestimations due to resolution and map smallness ) and , consequently , a moderated excess of power due to fully non - linear evolution could be hidden by our current uncertainties . our method ( based on n - body simulations )",
    "is fully nonlinear and , moreover , it takes into account both the effect due to the gravitational collapse of cosmological structures and that produced by the motion of these structures in the box .",
    "these are the most promising aspects of the proposed techniques whose future applications based on better n - body simulations and computers can improve on both the estimation of the rs spectrum ( pointing out posible new features ) and the detection of deviations from gaussianity . in other words , although improvements on the applications of the ray tracing procedure used here are possible , current applications lead to too small rs maps and moderate n - body resolutions and , consequently , only an upper limit to the rs spectrum ( rough estimate of it ) has been obtained in this paper .",
    "fortunately , we are going to see that this estimate suffices to discuss detection of the rs effect with wmap and planck satellites ( see below ) and , furthermore , our detection of deviations from gaussianity in rs maps seems to be doubtless .",
    "a few comments about previous results are now necessary for comparisons .",
    "the angular power spectrum of the rees - sciama effect was studied by @xcite and @xcite . in both papers ,",
    "the effect was estimated for open and flat cold dark matter universes without cosmological constant . in the first of these papers , the authors used n - body simulations and a certain ray - tracing procedure to get the @xmath54 coefficients for @xmath200 . among their results",
    "we emphasize the following ones : ( @xmath201 ) in the case of a flat universe ( with h=0.75 and @xmath202 ) , and for @xmath49 close to @xmath203 , quantity @xmath156 takes on values around @xmath204 , and ( @xmath205 ) for @xmath206 this quantity reaches a maximum value close to @xmath207 . in the second paper ,",
    "@xcite did not use any ray tracing procedure .",
    "he used n - body simulations ( second order perturbation theory ) to evolve the density contrast of strongly ( mildly ) non - linear structures and , then , from the resulting contrast , the author estimated the power spectrum of the quantity @xmath208 . finally , from this spectrum , the @xmath54 quantities were calculated .",
    "four cases corresponding to different values of the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath209 were studied using n - body simulations . some results corresponding to these four cases",
    "are now summarized : ( i ) the temperature contrast @xmath210 takes on values between @xmath211 and @xmath212 , ( ii ) quantity @xmath156 is maximum between @xmath213 and @xmath214 , ( iii ) the maximum values of @xmath156 range from @xmath215 to @xmath216 and , ( iv ) the values corresponding to @xmath217 ranges from @xmath204 to @xmath218 ( the first of these values corresponds to a flat universe with h=0.5 and @xmath219 ) .",
    "more recently , the rs effect has been estimated , in the concordance model , for various slightly different values of the involved parameters ( see , e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) ; these estimations are not based on n - body simulations and they lead to small values of @xmath156 for @xmath220 ; these values are @xmath221 in @xcite and @xmath222 in @xcite .",
    "as it has been discussed in section 4 , the value of @xmath223 extracted from our small rs simulations seems to be between @xmath160 and @xmath224 ; this approximated value seems to be a little greater than those found ( with other models and methods ) by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath156 spectrum given in the three last of these references and that obtained by us slowly decrease for @xmath225 ; nevertheless , our spectrum decreases slower than that shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our @xmath156 overestimations , at large @xmath49 values , associated to map smallness ( see section 4 ) seem to explain this difference .    the @xmath190 correlation induced by the rs effect was studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of these authors was that this odd correlation is smaller than its cosmic variance , which suggests that it is too small to be detected from a unique complete realization of the rs sky .",
    "of course , we have not any map of the full sky , but very small maps of the rs effect and , consequently , it should not be possible the estimation of @xmath190 from these small parts of the full sky . in spite of these considerations and taking into account",
    "that the mentioned estimates of @xmath190 are based on perturbation theory , which does not properly describe strong non - linear evolution inside cluster and substructures , we have tried the estimation of the @xmath190 and @xmath191 correlations from our @xmath194 and @xmath195 rs maps ; nevertheless , this estimate has not been possible , which confirms the low level of these odd correlations in the maps of the rs effect .",
    "even correlations have been calculated for both cmb and rs small maps and , after comparisons , a certain deviation with respect to gaussianity has been pointed out in the rs case ( see section 5 ) ; however , no deviations have appeared in the analysis of the superimposition of rs and cmb maps .",
    "it is due to the fact that the rs non - gaussian part is much smaller than the cmb gaussian one .",
    "the superimposition is almost gaussian and , consequently , cosmic variance errors , @xmath226^{1/2 }   c_{\\ell}$ ] , are a good approximation to the @xmath227 uncertainty in full sky measurements .",
    "these errors can be easily calculated taking into account that the angular power spectrum of the superimposition is almost identical to that of pure cmb . in the @xmath49 interval [ 500,2000 ] , where we have found our best estimate of the rs spectrum ( see section 4 ) , one easily finds the errors of @xmath156 , in @xmath62 , associated to cosmic variance .",
    "they are displayed in the solid line of fig .",
    "[ figu11 ] . in the same figure",
    ", the dotted line is our best estimate of the rs spectrum ( also represented in the dotted line of fig .",
    "[ figu4 ] ) , and the dashed line is a new spectrum which has been obtained using the same method as in the case of the dotted line , but assuming @xmath228 in our hr simulations . this new normalization is suggested by the analysis of the three year wmap data published @xcite after the submission of the first version of this paper . in fig .",
    "[ figu11 ] we see that , for the two @xmath229 values we have considered , our upper limits to the rs spectrum are well below the cosmic errors for @xmath230 ; hence , taking into account that wmap can not accurately measure @xmath54 coefficients for @xmath231 ( see @xcite ) , one easily concludes that the rs effect can not be observed with this satellite .",
    "finally , the upper limits to the rs spectrum displayed in the dotted and dashed lines are well above @xmath156 errors for @xmath232 ; however , taking into account that the true rs spectra are expected to be around @xmath162 smaller than our upper limits for large @xmath49 values ( see section 4 ) , it follows that the true @xmath156 values are not expected to be greater than the cosmic errors given by the solid line of fig .",
    "[ figu11 ] .",
    "this means that , although all the multipoles up to @xmath233 could be measured with planck , the rs effect would be too small to be detected with this satellite .",
    "all these considerations strongly suggest that the rs effect will not be directly detected in the near future .",
    "indirect detection based on correlations of the cmb with the cluster distribution producing the effect deserves attention .",
    "simulations in great boxes would lead to more extended rs maps ( improving on power spectrum estimation and non - gaussianity detection ) . in the case of large simulation boxes with @xmath234 , which can be currently considered with appropriate n - body codes and computers , the magnification of the rs effect associated to periodicity is not negligible because eight of these boxes are yet necessary to cover the photon trajectory from @xmath235 to present time .",
    "of course , our method based on a preferred direction also applies for these big boxes .",
    "after minimum changes , our codes will be ready to built up better rs maps from appropriate n - body simulations , and also to statistically analyze these maps .",
