    "in this paper we present evidence of two newly emerging phenomena involving the representation spaces @xmath8 , for finitely generated discrete groups @xmath1 admitting compact classifying spaces . the first phenomenon is akin to the classical atiyah  segal theorem , and relates carlsson s deformation @xmath2theory spectrum @xmath4 ( an object built from the representation spaces ) to the topological @xmath2theory of the classifying space @xmath3 .",
    "second is that in dimensions higher than the cohomological dimension of @xmath1 , the homotopy groups of the coarse moduli space @xmath9 appear to vanish after an appropriate stabilization . in some cases , including the surface groups considered here , this stabilization simply amounts to forming the colimit @xmath10 if @xmath1 is the fundamental group of a compact manifold @xmath11 , this space may also be viewed as the stable moduli space of flat connections ( or hermitian bundles ) over @xmath11 .",
    "the link between these phenomena is provided by recent work of tyler lawson  @xcite , which shows that @xmath12 is closely related to the cofiber of the bott map in deformation @xmath2theory ( see section  [ coarse - moduli ] ) .",
    "lawson applied his theorems to prove that for finitely generated free groups @xmath13 , one has a weak equivalence ( of @xmath14algebras ) @xmath15 , and that the stable moduli space @xmath16 is homotopy equivalent to the torus @xmath17 .",
    "lawson s work also provides analogous statements for free abelian groups ( note though that @xmath18 may be computed by hand , using the fact that commuting matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable ) . in this paper",
    "we use morse theory for the yang  mills functional to prove :    * theorem [ main - thm ] *    bott periodicity provides an isomorphism @xmath19 for any space @xmath20 , but the isomorphism constructed in this paper more naturally lands in @xmath21 .",
    "this result yields a complete computation of @xmath22 ( corollary  [ k - groups ] ) . the isomorphism is natural for smooth maps between surfaces , and is in particular equivariant with respect to the mapping class group of the surface . for non - orientable surfaces",
    ", there is actually an isomorphism on @xmath23 as well ; this is just a re - interpretation of the results of ho and liu  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath24 , theorem  [ main - thm ] follows from t. lawson s product formula @xmath25  @xcite together with his calculation of @xmath26 as a @xmath14module  @xcite . as we will explain , theorem  [ main - thm ] provides evidence that the homotopy groups of @xmath27 vanish above dimension 2 in the orientable case and above dimension 1 in the non - orientable case ; it also allows us to compute the non - zero groups ( corollary  [ moduli ] and proposition  [ moduli2 ] ) .",
    "theorem  [ main - thm ] is closely related to the classical theorem of atiyah and segal  @xcite . for a compact lie group @xmath28 , the topological @xmath2theory of the infinite complex @xmath3",
    "is the limit of the @xmath2theories of the skeleta @xmath29 , and hence has the structure of a complete ring ( this follows most readily from a @xmath30 calculation ) . the atiyah ",
    "segal theorem states that this ring is isomorphic to the completion of the representation ring @xmath0 at its augmentation ideal ( the virtual representations of virtual dimension zero ) .    for groups @xmath1 with @xmath3 compact , @xmath31 is no longer complete and one might hope to relate @xmath32 directly to @xmath0 .",
    "deformation @xmath2theory may be viewed as the direct homotopical analogue of @xmath0 ( see section  [ deformations ] ) , so theorem  [ main - thm ] should be viewed as a direct homotopical analogue of the atiyah  segal theorem .",
    "this suggests that deformation @xmath2theory is the proper setting in which to study atiyah ",
    "segal phenomena for groups with compact classifying spaces , and we expect that for many such groups @xmath1 , the deformation @xmath2-groups of @xmath1 will agree with @xmath33 for @xmath34 greater than the cohomological dimension of @xmath1 minus one .",
    "the author s excision result for free products  @xcite and lawson s product formula  @xcite indicate that this phenomenon should be stable under both free and direct products of discrete groups .",
    "in particular , an atiyah  segal theorem for free products of surface groups follows immediately from theorem  [ main - thm ] together with the main result from  @xcite ( or can be deduced from the proof of theorem  [ main - thm ] ) .",
    "the extent of this relationship is at yet unclear . in all known examples ,",
    "deformation @xmath2theory eventually becomes 2periodic , but there are examples in which these periodic groups fail to agree with @xmath2theory of the classifying space ( see section  [ deformations ] ) .    extensions and analogues of the atiyah ",
    "segal theorem ( or more generally , the relation between representations and @xmath2theory ) have been studied extensively . for infinite discrete groups @xmath1",
    "satisfying appropriate finiteness conditions , adem  @xcite and lck  @xcite have studied the relationship between the @xmath2theory of the classifying space @xmath3 and the representation rings of the finite subgroups of @xmath1 .",
    "lck and oliver  @xcite considered the case of an infinite discrete group @xmath1 acting properly , i.e. with finite stabilizers , on a space @xmath20 .",
    "they showed that the @xmath1equivariant @xmath2theory of @xmath20 , completed appropriately , agrees with the topological @xmath2theory of the homotopy orbit space @xmath35 .",

    "deformation @xmath2theory should also prove useful in studying atiyah ",
    "segal phenomena for groups with non - compact classifying spaces , and in this context , carlsson s derived completion  @xcite should play the role of the completed representation ring .",
    "this approach should lead to a spectrum - level version of the atiyah ",
    "segal theorem itself , and may also yield spectrum - level versions of these various extensions .    in a different direction",
    ", the baum - connes conjecture relates an analytical version of the representation ring of a group @xmath1 ( namely the reduced @xmath36algebra of @xmath1 ) to the equivariant @xmath2homology of the classifying space for proper actions .",
    "it is interesting to note that for a non - orientable surface @xmath6 , deformation @xmath2theory recovers the topological @xmath2theory of @xmath6 , whereas the @xmath2theory of @xmath37 is the @xmath2homology of @xmath3 . a direct relationship between deformation @xmath2-theory and the @xmath36algebras , at least for groups with no torsion in their ( co)homology , would be extremely interesting .",
    "the failure of theorem  [ main - thm ] in degree zero ( and the failure in higher degrees for tori  @xcite ) is an important feature of deformation @xmath2theory , and reflects its close ties to the topology of representation spaces .",
    "while @xmath2theory is a stable homotopy invariant of @xmath28 ( i.e. depends only on the stable homotopy type of @xmath38 ) , the representation spaces carry a great deal more information about the group @xmath28 , and some of this information is captured by the low - dimensional deformation @xmath2groups .",
    "hence deformation @xmath2theory should be viewed as a subtler invariant of @xmath28 , and its relationship to the topological @xmath2theory of @xmath38 should be viewed as an important computational tool .    as an application of theorem  [ main - thm ] ( and a justification of the preceding paragraph ) , we obtain homotopy - theoretical information about the stable moduli space @xmath39 of flat unitary connections over a compact , aspherical surface @xmath11 . ho and liu  @xcite computed the components of this moduli space before stabilization ( for general structure groups ) . in section  [ coarse - moduli ] ,",
    "we combine our work with t. lawson s results on the bott map in deformation @xmath2theory  @xcite to study these moduli spaces after stabilizing with respect to the rank .",
    "in particular , we prove :    let @xmath11 be a compact , aspherical surface .",
    "then the fundamental group of the stable moduli space @xmath39 is isomorphic to @xmath40 , and if @xmath11 is orientable then @xmath41 .",
    "lawson s results naturally lead to a conjectural description of the homotopy type of @xmath39 ( for a compact , aspherical surfaces @xmath11 ) . for an orientable surface @xmath42",
    ", we expect that @xmath43 ; for a non - orientable surface @xmath6 we expect a homotopy equivalence @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the rank @xmath46 .",
    "theorem  [ main - thm ] relies on morse theory for the yang  mills functional , as devoped by atiyah and bott  @xcite , daskalopoulos  @xcite , and rde  @xcite ; the key analytical input comes from uhlenbeck s compactness theorem  @xcite .",

    "@xmath50    in this section , we motivate and introduce carlsson s notion of deformation @xmath2theory  @xcite and discuss its basic properties .",
    "deformation @xmath2theory is a contravariant functor from discrete groups to spectra , and is meant to capture homotopy - theoretical information about the representation spaces of the group in question . as first observed by t. lawson  @xcite , this spectrum may be constructed as the @xmath2theory spectrum associated to a topological permutative category of representations ( for details see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) ) . here we will take a more naive , but essentially equivalent , approach .",
    "the present viewpoint makes clear the precise analogy between deformation @xmath2theory and the classical representation ring .",
    "@xmath51    associated to any group @xmath1 , one has the ( unitary ) representation ring @xmath0 , which consists of  virtual isomorphism classes \" of representations .",
    "each representation @xmath52 induces a vector bundle @xmath53 ( where @xmath1 acts on @xmath54 by deck transformations and on @xmath55 via the representation @xmath56 ) over the classifying space @xmath3 , and this provides a map @xmath57 . when @xmath1 is a compact lie group , the atiyah ",
    "segal theorem states that @xmath58 becomes an isomorphism after completing @xmath0 at its augmentation ideal .",
    "now consider the simplest infinite discrete group , namely @xmath59 .",
    "representations of @xmath60 are simply unitary matrices , and isomorphism classes of representations are conjugacy classes in @xmath61 . by the spectral theorem , these conjugacy classes correspond to points in the symmetric product @xmath62 , and the natural map @xmath63 is injective .",
    "so the discrete representation ring of @xmath60 is quite large , and bears little relation to @xmath2theory of @xmath64 : every complex vector bundle over @xmath65 is trivial , and so @xmath66 is just the integers .    in this",
    "setting , deformations of representations play an important role .",
    "a deformation of a representation @xmath67 is simply a representation @xmath68 and a continuous path of representations @xmath69 connecting @xmath70 to @xmath68 .",
    "the path @xmath69 now induces a bundle homotopy @xmath71 between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "hence the bundle associated to @xmath70 is _ isomorphic _ to the bundle associated to each of its deformations , and the map from representations to @xmath2theory factors through deformation classes .",
    "is actually isomorphic to @xmath56 , because the trace of a representation gives a continuous , complete invariant of the isomorphism type , and on representations of a fixed dimension , the trace takes on only finitely many values .",
    "hence when @xmath28 is finite , deformations are already taken into account by the construction of @xmath74 . ]",
    "returning to the example @xmath59 , we observe that since @xmath61 is path connected , the natural map from deformation classes of representations to @xmath2theory of @xmath75 group completes to an isomorphism .",
    "with this situation understood , one is inclined to look for an analogue of the representation ring which captures deformations of representations , i.e. the topology of representation spaces .",
    "the most naive approach fails rather badly : the monoid of deformation classes @xmath76 admits a well - defined map to @xmath77 , but ( despite the case @xmath59 ) this map does not usually group - complete to an isomorphism : the representation spaces @xmath8 are compact cw - complexes , so have finitely many components , but there can be infinitely many isomorphism types of @xmath78dimensional bundles over @xmath3 . in the case of riemann surfaces ( i.e. complex curves )",
    "@xmath6 , the spaces @xmath79 are always connected ( see discussion at the end of section  [ gp - comp ] ) , so the monoid of deformation classes is just @xmath80 and its group completion is @xmath60 ; on the other hand bundles over a riemann surface are determined by their dimension and first chern class ( and all chern classes are realized ) so @xmath81 .",
    "note here that @xmath82 except in the case of the riemann sphere .",
    "the deformation - theoretical approach is not doomed to failure , though .",
    "let @xmath83 denote the topological monoid of unitary representation spaces , and let @xmath84 denote the grothendieck group functor .",
    "carlsson s deformation @xmath2theory spectrum @xmath4  @xcite is a lifting of the functor @xmath85 to the category of spectra , or in fact , @xmath14algebras , in the sense that @xmath86 the isomorphism @xmath87 for @xmath7 in theorem  [ main - thm ] may be seen as a correction to the fact that @xmath88 fails to be an isomorphism when @xmath6 is a compact , aspherical riemann surface .",
    "we conclude this section by noting two cases in which deformation @xmath2-theory fails to agree with topological @xmath2-theory , even in high dimensions .",
    "lawson showed  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 34 ) that the deformation @xmath2theory of the integral heisenberg group @xmath89 , whose classifying space is a 3manifold , is 2periodic starting in dimension 1 .",
    "however , its homotopy groups are infinitely generated . as pointed out to me by ian",
    "leary , there also exist groups @xmath1 which have no finite dimensional unitary representations , but _ do _ have non - trivial @xmath2theory .",
    "leary s examples arise from higman s group  @xcite @xmath90 which has no finite quotients , and hence no finite - dimensional unitary representations ( a representation would give a linear quotient , and by a well - known theorem of malcev , finitely generated linear groups are residually finite ) .",
    "now , higman s group has the ( co)homology of a point ,  @xcite , or from the fact that the presentation 2-complex for @xmath91 is a model for @xmath92 ( with 4 one - cells and 4 two - cells ) .",
    "the latter fact follows from higman s proof that @xmath93 .",
    "] so can now build a kan  thurston group for @xmath94 by amalgamating two copies of @xmath91 along the infinite cyclic subgroups generated , say , by @xmath95 .",
    "the resulting group @xmath28 still admits no unitary representations but now has the integral ( co)homology , hence the @xmath2theory , of a 2sphere . in this case @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath97    for the rest of this section , we fix a discrete group @xmath1 .",
    "the construction of the ( unitary ) representation ring @xmath0 may be broken down into several steps : one begins with the _ sets _",
    "@xmath8 , which form a monoid under direct sum ; next , one takes isomorphism classes by modding out the actions of the groups @xmath61 on the sets @xmath8 .",
    "the monoid structure descends to the quotient , and in fact tensor product now induces the structure of a semi - ring .",
    "finally , we form the grothendieck ring @xmath0 of this semi - ring of isomorphism classes .",
    "deformation @xmath2theory ( additively , at least ) may be constructed simply by replacing each step in this construction by its homotopy theoretical analogue . to be precise ,",
    "we begin with the _ space _ @xmath98 which is a topological monoid under block sum . rather than passing to @xmath61orbit spaces , we now form the homotopy quotient @xmath99 block sum of unitary matrices induces maps @xmath100 , and together with the monoid structure on @xmath83 these give @xmath101 the structure of a topological monoid ( for associativity to hold , we must use a functorial model for @xmath102 , as opposed to the infinite stiefel manifolds ; see remark  [ mixed ] ) .",
    "finally , we apply the homotopical version of the grothendieck construction to this topological monoid and call the resulting space @xmath4 , the ( unitary ) deformation @xmath2theory of @xmath1 .",
    "the deformation @xmath2theory of a discrete group @xmath1 is the space @xmath103 whose homotopy groups we denote by @xmath104 .",
    "here @xmath105 denotes the simplicial bar construction , namely the classifying space of the topological category with one object and with @xmath101 as its space of morphisms .",
    "note that @xmath4 is a contravariant functor from discrete groups to spaces .",
    "it was shown in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) that the above space @xmath4 is weakly equivalent to the zeroth space of the connective @xmath48spectrum associated to t. lawson s topological permutative category of unitary representations ; in particular the homotopy groups of this spectrum agree with the homotopy groups of the space @xmath4 .",
    "we note that constructing a ring structure in deformation @xmath2theory requires a subtler approach , and this has been carried out by t. lawson  @xcite .",
    "the first two homotopy groups of @xmath4 have rather direct meanings : @xmath106 is the grothendieck group of virtual connected components of representations , i.e. @xmath85  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) .",
    "it follows from work of lawson  @xcite that the group @xmath107 is a stable version of the group @xmath108 ; a precise discussion will be given in section  [ coarse - moduli ] .",
    "[ mixed ] in  @xcite , the simplicial model @xmath109 for @xmath102 is used ; in this paper we will need to use universal bundles for sobolev gauge groups , where the simplicial model may not give an actual universal bundle .",
    "hence it is more convenient to use milnor s infinite join construction @xmath110  @xcite , which is functorial and applies to all topological groups .",
    "these two constructions are related by the  mixed model \" @xmath111 , which maps by weak equivalences to both versions of @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113    the starting point for our work on surface groups is an analysis of the consequences of mcduff  segal group completion theorem  @xcite for deformation @xmath2theory , as carried out in  @xcite .",
    "here we recall that result and explain its consequences for surface groups . given a topological monoid @xmath11 and an element @xmath114 , we say that @xmath11 is _ stably group - like _ with respect to @xmath115 if the submonoid of @xmath116 generated by the component containing @xmath115 is cofinal ( in @xmath116 ) .",
    "explicitly , @xmath11 is stably - group - like with respect to @xmath115 if for every @xmath117 , there exists an element @xmath118 such that @xmath119 is connected by a path to @xmath120 for some @xmath121 .",
    "we then have :    @xmath122 let @xmath1 be a finitely generated discrete group such that @xmath83 is stably group - like with respect to @xmath123 .",

    "the novel aspect of this result is that , unlike elsewhere in algebraic @xmath2theory , quillen s + -construction does not appear .",
