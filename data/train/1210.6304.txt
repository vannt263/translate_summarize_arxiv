    "both gapless ( massles ) energy band structure and peculiarities of scattering mechanisms determine the response of graphene on the in - plane polarized radiation in the thz and mir spectral regions .",
    "such a response is caused by both the direct intersubband transitions and the intraband transitions of free carriers accompanied by scattering processes ( the drude mechanism ) , see the reviews @xcite and references therein .",
    "contributions of these two mechanisms in heavily - doped graphene are described by the inter- and intraband dynamic conductivities , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 stand for the fermi energy and the momentum relaxation time , @xmath5 is the static conductivity , and @xmath6 is a unity step - like fuction .",
    "here we have neglected a weak imaginary contribution @xmath7 @xcite and the smearing of the interband absorption edge associated with the finiteness of the temperature , @xmath8 , and the collisional damping of the electron spectrum .",
    "when such a damping can be neglected at @xmath9 , the expression for @xmath10 describes an abrupt jump at photon energy @xmath11 due to the pauli blocking effect .",
    "the interband and intraband contributions are of the same order of magnitude at @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the overlap of these contributions disappears if @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "thus , the description of interplay between both contributions is necessary in the thz ( or mir , depending on the doping level ) spectral region for the typical samples with @xmath14 . as shown below , the quasi - classical description of the intraband absorption and , therefore , the expression for @xmath15 based on the drude formula is not valid if @xmath16 exceeds temperature of carriers @xcite .",
    "this is because of the variation of the relaxation time as a function of the electron energy over energy intervals @xmath17 , where the intraband transitions take place ( see fig .",

    "mir spectroscopy allows for the control of the pauli blocking effect using the electrical gating  @xcite . in sufficiently heavily doped graphene ,",
    "the drude mechanism of absorption was observed near the interband threshold , up to the mir spectral region .",
    "despite of a series of theoretical studies ( see refs .",
    "12 - 14 and references therein ) , which have treated the problem of intra- and interband absorption at different levels of approximation , there are two drawbacks in the interpretation of the above - listed experimental data .",
    "first , the quantum description of the intraband absorption was not connected with the scattering parameters determined from the conductivity measurements and , second , an inhomogeneous smearing of the interband threshold due to long - range disorder was not considered .",
    "thus , a re - examination of the intra- and interband absorption processes in a disorded graphene is timely now .    in this paper",
    ", we present a general consideration which is based on the kubo formula and takes into account both the scattering due to finite - range disorder and _ a long - range unscreened variation of concentration_. the latter contribution appears to be essential because the screening of the potential spatial variations associated with the disorder with the in - plane scales longer than ( or comparable to ) the distance to gate is suppressed .",
    "this mechanism is schematically illustrated in figs .",
    "1c and 1d . as a result ,",
    "the inhomogeneous mechanism of smearing of the interband absorption at @xmath20 should be taken into account , together with the thermal smearing of the fermi distribution and broadening of the spectral density due to the elastic scattering on the finite - range disorder . the dynamic conductivity in the high - frequency range ( if @xmath21 ) is expressed via the green s function , which is averaged over the finite - range disorder , and the carrier distribution averaged over the long - range non - screened disorder .",
    "the averaged characteristics of green s function were obtained using the phenomenological description of the static conductivity similarly to ref .",
    "considering the interplay of the intra- and interband contributions , we analyze the spectral , temperature , and gate voltage dependencies of the absorption efficiency .",
    "the obtained results are compared with the recent experimental data .",
    "the fitting procedure demonstrates that the disorder characterization , including the evaluation of the parameters of high - energy scattering and long - range inhomogeneties , can be performed using the thz and mir spectroscopy .",

    "iii we analyze the spectra of relative absorption and their dependencies on the temperature disorder and as well as on the doping conditions .",
    "the last section includes the discussion of experimental data and the approximations used , and the conclusions .",
    "we start with consideration of the dynamic conductivity based on the kubo formula which takes into account the elastic scattering and the unscreened long - range disorder .",
