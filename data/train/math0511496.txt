    "it is clear that every finite system @xmath22 of convex polygons in the plane can be transformed to an initial configuration @xmath23 by taking the similarity ratio @xmath7 sufficiently small , except for the degenerate case , where all the centroids of polygons of @xmath22 are collinear .",

    "[ pic2 ] . for the line",
    "@xmath36 the shrinking factor is @xmath37 and for @xmath38 the shrinking factor is @xmath39 .",
    "it is not difficult to express the correcting factor explicitly . for given line @xmath34 and polygon @xmath9 we can construct the ` minimal strip ' containing @xmath9 with boundary lines , which are the translates of @xmath34 ( see fig [ pic2 ] , for the line @xmath36 the strip",
    "is bounded by the lines @xmath40 ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath41 the distance of point @xmath42 from the line @xmath43 and by @xmath44 the line , parallel with @xmath34 such that @xmath45 then the correcting factor can be expressed as : @xmath46 thus , the following proposition holds .",
    "* case 1 . *",
    "if , for some configuration @xmath50 , there exists a transversal @xmath30 , which has nonempty intersections with interiors of all polygons from @xmath49 , then all shrinking factors @xmath51 have values less than 1 , and so has also the number @xmath52 then , the configuration @xmath53 has the same transversal @xmath30 , but smaller similarity ratio , so the configuration @xmath49 can not be minimal .    *",
    "* now let us consider the second case , when for some configuration @xmath49 there is exactly one polygon @xmath54 with no interior points belonging to given transversal @xmath30 of @xmath49 ( i.e. @xmath30 is the tangent line of @xmath55 ) .",
    "let us introduce the function @xmath56 defined by formula : @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the correcting factors of polygons @xmath59 , when the transversal @xmath30 is translated so that the shrinking factor of polygon @xmath55 will become @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ pic3 ] ) .        for @xmath60",
    "we have the untranslated transversal @xmath30 .",
    "we will consider only values of @xmath7 in interval @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is such number that for @xmath63 the translated line @xmath30 remains no longer the transversal of @xmath49 , so @xmath64 for some @xmath65 if @xmath66 ( cf .",
    "[ pic3 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath67 , because if it is not true , then some other polygon @xmath68 should touch the transversal @xmath30 .",
    "it can be easily shown that the function @xmath56 is continuous ( it follows from proposition [ prop1 ] ) .",
    "now , we have : @xmath69 it follows that for some @xmath70 or @xmath71 for such @xmath72 the translated transversal is the also transversal for configuration @xmath73 , so the original configuration @xmath18 can not be minimal .",
    "* case 3 . *",
    "finally , lets us consider some configuration @xmath49 in which there are exactly two polygons @xmath74 with no interior points belonging to given transversal @xmath30 of @xmath49 .",
    "it is sufficient to take into account only such configuration , where @xmath75 lie in distinct halfplanes , determined by the transversal @xmath30 , because if they are situated in the same halfplane , we can proceed as in preceding case .",
    "now , consider the function : @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the correcting factors of polygons @xmath55 , when the transversal @xmath30 is moved so that the shrinking factor of both polygons @xmath75 will become @xmath7 ( fig . [ pic4 ] ) .",
    "analogically as in case 2 .",
    "we will consider only values of @xmath7 lying in interval @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is such number that for @xmath63 the moved line @xmath30 remains no longer the transversal of @xmath49 , so @xmath78 for some @xmath79 .",
    "if the function @xmath56 is continuous , we can proceed exactly as in case 2 .",
    ", showing that moved transversal @xmath30 is also the transversal for some configuration @xmath80 with @xmath81 ; thus , @xmath49 can not be the minimal configuration .",
    "when we consider two moved transversals @xmath82 for slightly different values @xmath83 of @xmath7 , it is clear , that the angle between them can be made arbitrarily small by choosing the difference @xmath84 to be sufficiently small .",
    "now , we can enclose both @xmath85 and @xmath86 in a strip , bounded by parallel lines .",
    "because the width of the strip can be made also arbitrarily small by choosing @xmath83 to be very close , we have reduced the problem of continuity of @xmath77 to the analogical problem for translates , which was analysed in case 2 .",
    "so , considering above three cases , we prove that if @xmath49 is minimal configuration for @xmath22 then ( at least ) three polygons from @xmath49 exist , which have the transversal @xmath30 to @xmath49 as the tangent line .",
    "all three polygons can not lie in the same halfplane , determined by @xmath30 , because such configuration can be easily reduced by method used in case 2 .",
    "conversely , if for some configuration @xmath49 we can find three polygons from @xmath49 , which have the transversal @xmath30 as common tangent and these polygons do not lie in the same halfplane , determined by @xmath30 , then it is obvious ( see fig . [",
    "three ] ; only three mentioned polygons are shown , the location of other polygons from @xmath49 does not matter ) that @xmath49 is minimal configuration .",
    "really , by any change of @xmath7 to smaller value @xmath87 , we obtain a strip of nonzero width , bounded by parallel lines , which separates the mentioned polygons , so we can not find the line ( transversal ) , which has common points with all three polygons .",
    "from this fact it is also clear that the traversal for minimal configuration is unique ."
