    "through the detection of very high - energy neutrinos ( threshold a few 100@xmath0gev ) , icecube @xcite will open a new window on the universe . by viewing astronomical sources with neutrinos as astronomical messengers",
    ", it will address fundamental questions in high energyastrophysics , particle physics and cosmology . through the detection of surface electrons and muons ,",
    "the associated icetop surface array will allow us to study the chemical composition of high energy cosmic rays ( @xmath1ev ) and will also help calibrate icecube and provide a background veto .",
    "icecube and underwater neutrino telescopes @xcite share scientific interests , such as searches for steady or variable neutrino emission from point like source candidates like active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , supernova remnants ( snr ) , microquasars and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) . by virtue of the low ambient noise level in the ice , the ability to detect low - energy supernova neutrinos as an increase in the overall trigger rate is unique to icecube among all uhe neutrino detectors . on the more speculative side , searches for neutrinos from annihiliations of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , for magnetic monopoles and other exotic particles like strange quark matter or susy q - balls can be listed ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "icecube will consist of 4800 digital optical modules ( doms ) , organized in 80 strings , each with 60 doms attached , buried in the ice at depths of 1450@xmath0 m to 2450@xmath0m@xmath0 .",
    "doms will have a vertical spacing of 17@xmath0 m and the strings will be regularly spaced horizontally by 125@xmath0m@xmath0 . at each string location",
    "two icetop tanks , each containing two doms frozen in ice , will be deployed .",
    "the buried doms will have an effective surface area of around 1@xmath0km@xmath2 , promising optimal sensitivity for neutrinos in the energy range of 1 to 10000@xmath0tev while being able to trigger on all higher- and on some of the lower - energy neutrinos , including mev - bursts @xcite .",
    "the positions of icecube strings , and the icetop tanks deployed above them , are shown in figure 1 .",
    "simulations have shown that icecube s sensitivity to possible signals is roughly constant for a wide range of feasible configurations .",
    "digital optical modules ( doms ) form the fundamental building blocks of the icecube detector .",
    "each dom contains a 10@xmath0  hamamatsu r-7081 photo multiplier ( pmt ) .",
    "the high voltage for the pmt is converted in the dom from its 48@xmath0v dc power supply to achieve the design gain of around 5@xmath3 . within a dom ,",
    "the pmt signal is split into two copies , with one used for triggering and the other delayed and then digitized if the threshold condition is met .",
    "digitization occurs in two types of dom - resident digitizers , to extend the digitization time while keeping the resolution high at early times .",
    "there is a set of two four - channel asic analog transient waveform digitizers ( atwds ) and a commercial 40@xmath0mhz fadc with up to 256 samples and 16 bit resolution available .",
    "the two atwds operate at 300@xmath0mhz and at none , 16 , 32 , 64 or 128 sample depths with 8- or 16-bit resolution .",
    "the two atwds are fed signals in a ping - pong manner , reducing dom dead time to less than 1@xmath0%@xmath0 .",
    "the first three channels of each of the atwds are fed signals that have been amplified with factors of 16 , 4 and 2/3 .",
    "this combination of atwds and fadc ensures the design dynamic range of up to 200 photo electrons ( p.@xmath0e . ) within the first 15@xmath0ns and up to 2000 p.@xmath0e . within the first 5@xmath4 .",
    "the fourth atwd channel can be connected to various inputs like the dom - clock ticks or led driving currents , creating a versatile diagnosis and calibration tool .",
    "the doms further contain a 405@xmath0 nm led flasher board , producing programmable light flashes of various intensities detectable by other modules in the array .",
    "this capability is useful for studying ice properties and calibrating the relative positions of doms . a preliminary version of a dom , deployed in an icetop tank in january 2004 , is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the dom mainboard has a free - running timer which needs to be synchronized with nanosecond accuracy to gps time , requiring re - calibration roughly every minute .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , a surface circuit sends a bipolar signal at a gps - latched time @xmath5 , received at a time @xmath6 . after a certain , fixed time interval @xmath7 , an identical circuit in the dom sends an identical bipolar pulse to the surface , detected at a time @xmath8 .",
    "the cable transmission time is then : @xmath9 .",
    "this calibration reduces signal time spread to the inevitable contribution from light scattering in the antarctic ice .",
    "currently a fully digital , tcp / ip - based approach for the daq system is under development , following closely the modular structure of the experimental setup : each _ string processor _",
    "stores dom - data and passes trigger primitives on to the _ inice trigger _ , which , after examining trigger primitives from all _ string processors _ , sends its trigger decisions to the",
    "_ global trigger_. the _ global trigger _ combines _ inice trigger _ , _ icetop trigger _ and other ( external ) information to form its decision . if positive , the _ event builder _ is instructed to retrieve dom data from the _ string processors _ and assembles them to icecube events that get passed to the _ online filter cluster _ for further processing .",
    "all of these daq system elements are implemented in commercial computers .",
    "the drilling process has been improved in several aspects compared to the amanda procedure : setup time for a season will be only three to five weeks , 60@xmath0 cm diameter holes will be drilled with water of 90@xmath10c@xmath0 from a number of heaters with a total power of 5@xmath0mw ( vs. 2@xmath0mw for amanda ) , a larger hose diameter reduced drill time to 40@xmath0h@xmath0 , and the fuel consumption will be lowered by about 30@xmath0%@xmath0 . with an estimated string drop time of around 20@xmath0h@xmath0 , it should be possible to deploy 16 or more strings per austral summer season , leading to a construction time of five to six years for the entire detector .",
    "with the assembly and testing of the first batch of doms under way , the icecube collaboration is on track for deployment of the first set of strings at the end of 2004 . the digital approach to readout and triggering , together with the sophisticated time calibration , will help to overcome the challenges posed by the sheer size of the detector and the time spreads induced by the antarctic ice as a detector medium , enabling icecube to produce useful data for scientific purposes after just the first few deployments .",
