    "the loop - generated effective @xmath3 coupling is sensitive to new physics at scales ( a  few)@xmath4 even in the simplest theories with minimal flavor violation , like the two - higgs - doublet model or the minimial supersymmetric standard model . measuring",
    "the inclusive @xmath5 is the most efficient way to constrain this coupling .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) contribution to this branching ratio forms a background to effects we would like to put bounds on .",
    "its precise qcd calculation has been a challenge for a long time .",
    "a satisfactory situation has not yet been reached even for the perturbative contributions .",
    "the current experimental world averages ( for @xmath6gev in the decaying meson rest frame ) read : [ aver ] b(|b x_s ) & = & \\ {    l ( 3.55 0.24_exp 0.09_model ) 10 ^ -4   , + ( 3.50 0.14_exp 0.10_model ) 10 ^ -4  .    .",
    "they have been obtained by combining the measurements of cleo  @xcite , babar  @xcite@xcite and belle  @xcite with different lower cuts @xmath7 on the photon energy , ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath9gev .",
    "an extrapolation in @xmath7 down to @xmath10gev has been performed simultaneously .",
    "uncertainties due to modeling the photon energy spectrum that matter both for the averaging and extrapolation have been singled out in eq .  .",
    "@xcite gives a larger error than  @xcite because it uses results at @xmath11gev from the older measurements  @xcite@xcite only , not taking into account the most precise ones from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "calculations including @xmath12 and @xmath13 effects in the sm give  @xcite [ sm ] b(|b x_s ) = ( 3.15 0.23 ) 10 ^ -4 , where the error is found by adding in quadrature the non - perturbative ( @xmath14 ) , perturbative ( @xmath15 ) and parametric ( @xmath16 ) uncertainties . the result in eq .",
    "is consistent with the averages at the @xmath17 level .",
    "its evaluation is based on an approximate equality of the hadronic and perturbatively calculable partonic decay widths [ main.approx ] ( |b x_s ) _ _ e _",
    "> e_0   ( b x_s^p ) _ _ e _",
    "> e_0 , where @xmath18 stands for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , etc .",
    "this approximation works well only in a certain range of @xmath7 , namely when @xmath7 is large ( @xmath23 ) but not too close to the endpoint ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "corrections to eq .",
    "( [ main.approx ] ) of various origin have been widely discussed in the literature , most recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "so long as only the photonic dipole operator @xmath25 is considered , non - perturbative corrections to eq .   for @xmath26 can be described in terms of the so - called fixed - order approach that has been derived  @xcite using the optical theorem and the operator product expansion .",
    "the corrections can then be written as a series in @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where perturbatively calculable coefficients multiply matrix elements of local operators between the @xmath0-meson states at rest .",
    "such matrix elements ( at least the leading ones ) can be extracted from measurements of observables that are insensitive to new physics , like the semileptonic @xmath30 decay spectra or mass differences between various @xmath31-flavored hadrons .",
    "coefficients at the terms of order @xmath32 and @xmath33 have been evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "very recently , a calculation at order @xmath34 has been completed  @xcite .",
    "the result explodes near the endpoint @xmath35 but remains perfectly consistent with the fixed - order approach at @xmath36gev or even @xmath37gev .",
    "thus , non - perturbative corrections to the `` 77 '' interference term are well under control . in many phenomenological analyses , normalization to the semileptonic rate",
    "is applied in such a way that most of those corrections cancel , leaving out a sub - percent effect .",
    "the most important non - perturbative uncertainty originates from the `` 27 '' interference term ( that stands for `` 27 '' and `` 17 '' ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , photons that can be treated in analogy to the `` 77 '' term are called `` direct '' , while all the other ones are called `` resolved '' , i.e. produced far away from the @xmath31-quark annihilation vertex . contributions from the resolved photons",
    "can still be written in terms of a series in powers of @xmath27 , but this time the @xmath38 term is non - vanishing when @xmath39 is treated as @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , they are uncertain , as they depend on matrix elements of non - local operators that can not be easily extracted from other measurements . diagrams representing such terms are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonp27 ] , where the external gluon is understood to be soft , while the other one ( if present ) is considered to be non - soft .",
    "if the charm quark was heavy enough ( @xmath41 ) , its loop in the first diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : nonp27 ] would become effectively local for soft gluons , and we would be back to the local operator description , as in the `` 77 '' term .",
    "this limit has been analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite . a series of the form [ volcor ] _ n=0^b_n o(^2m_c^2 ( m_bm_c^2)^n ) was found as a relative correction to eq .  .",
    "explicit results for all the coefficients @xmath42 showed that they are small and quickly decreasing with @xmath43 , which led to a conclusion that the first term in the series is a good approximation to the whole correction even in the @xmath44 case that we encounter in nature .",
    "the leading term is proportional to a local operator matrix element that can be extracted from the measured @xmath0@xmath45 mass difference .",
    "this way , a relative correction of around @xmath46 to eq .   has been found .",
    "this conclusion has recently been questioned in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of realistic shape function models that allowed to vary @xmath39 in the physically interesting range , and test applicability of the expansion  .",
    "it has been found that the first term of such an expansion in not really a good approximation if we allow for alternating - sign subleading shape functions ( see eq .",
    "( 108 ) in that paper ) .",
    "alternating signs were necessary to overpass normalization constraints , and make the shape function exponential tails wide enough for more energetic ( though still soft ) gluons .",
    "this is the main source of the overall @xmath47 non - perturbative uncertainty in the branching ratio that was estimated in ref .",
    "so long as @xmath39 is treated as @xmath48 , the considered correction is just @xmath49 .",
    "other ( smaller ) corrections studied in that paper were of order @xmath50 , and did not originate from the `` 27 '' interference term .",
    "apparently , the @xmath50 corrections _ alone _ were the reason for assigning a @xmath47 non - perturbative uncertainty to the branching ratio in refs .",
    "thus the two @xmath47 uncertainty estimates agree just by coincidence .",
    "the main worry in refs .",
    "@xcite were the second and third diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonp27 ] .",
    "although they look like @xmath51 corrections to the first one , they are not necessarily unimportant given that the smallness of the first one is partly accidental . it would be interesting to test their relevance using the shape function methods .",
    "this would make the analysis of @xmath50 uncertainties really complete .    in the end , let us recall that there exist non - perturbative corrections to eq .   that are not suppressed by @xmath52 at all .",
    "their intuitive description can be found in ref .",
    "in particular , collinear photon emission effects belong to this class  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , they are numerically small due to interplay of several minor suppression factors .",
    "given the present consistency of measurements and sm calculations , observing clean signals of new physics in @xmath53 is unlikely , even if the uncertainties are reduced by factors of 2 on both sides , which may be hoped for in the super-@xmath0 era .",
    "however , achieving such a reduction is worth an effort , as it would lead to strengthening constraints on most popular beyond - sm theories .",
    "several new perturbative nnlo results have been published this year , and new ones are expected in 2011 .",
    "as far as the non - perturbative corrections are concerned , they are still dominated by unknown contributions , but at least their estimates are now based on calculations rather than order - of - magnitude considerations .",
    "some room for improvement seems to remain both in the @xmath54 and @xmath50 cases .",
