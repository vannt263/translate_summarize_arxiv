    "the measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) from the wmap satellite @xcite and large - scale galaxy clustering from the 2df @xcite and sloan @xcite surveys have provided tight constraints on the value of cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "the combination of observations of different nature has the power to tighten constraints on the parameters of cosmological models ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a shortcoming of this approach , however , is that most parameter estimations use the same data .",
    "they are not independent and their agreement comes as no surprise .",
    "also , if one set of data suffers from uncontrolled systematic errors , those errors might affect the results and go unnoticed .",
    "it is therefore useful to check those results with an independent set of observations .",
    "some cosmological parameters such as the hubble parameter @xmath3 are ill - determined from one type of observations alone and a joint analysis is necessary in order to determine its value .",
    "if such an analysis is not available some prior value is often assumed , based on some dedicated observation .",
    "for example , the hst key project constraint on the value of the hubble constant @xmath4 km s@xmath5mpc@xmath5 often helps to tighten the determination of other parameter values @xcite .",
    "the robustness of such results might depend strongly on the prior . in this brief communication",
    "we use cosmological data to estimate cosmological parameters and to provide an independent test of more recent analyses .",
    "we combine data from the iras 1.2 jy @xcite and las campanas @xcite redshift surveys , galaxy peculiar velocity measurements @xcite and measurements of type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "we do not use any cosmic microwave background data .",
    "we examine our results according to subsets of data .",
    "we focus on three parameters : the matter density @xmath6 , the hubble parameter @xmath3 and the amplitude of mass density fluctuations @xmath7 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the sections [ lss - data ] and [ lss - method ]",
    "we describe the data and method used in the analysis .",
    "the results are presented in section [ lss - results ] and conclusions are presented in section [ lss - conclusions ] .",
    "the iras @xmath8 @xmath9 data set @xcite is an all - sky ( 87.6@xmath10 ) infra - red survey of 5313 galaxies .",
    "the density of galaxies in three dimensional space is sensitive to the mass density fluctuation parameter @xmath7 and the inferred matter power spectrum depends on the shape parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the likelihood function was calculated for flat universes within linear theory by @xcite and assumes that light traces mass via a linear bias factor @xmath12 .",
    "the likelihood is a function of the 3 parameters @xmath7 , @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",
    "the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) probes the same parameters as the iras survey but both the data and the likelihood function calculation differ in several ways .",
    "iras detected galaxies in the infra - red whereas the las campanas experiment measured @xmath14 galaxies at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "a different morphological selection took place in each of the experiments such that their bias parameters are different .",
    "the lcrs probes a deeper range of redshifts in finger - shaped volumes consisting of a northern and a southern sample .",
    "a karhunen - love ( kl ) eigenmode basis was constructed to correlate the measured redshifts as described in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the data were compared to matter power spectra expressed in terms of the kl basis from numerically simulated open - cdm structure formation scenarios with different values of @xmath7 , @xmath15 and @xmath11 .    unlike redshift surveys which measure the distribution of visible matter , peculiar velocity measurements are a dynamical probe of the matter power spectrum . within the assumption that galaxies trace the large - scale gravitation induced velocity field it is expected that velocities obey linear theory better than density due to the non - local character of the gravitational field .",
    "this likelihood function was calculated in @xcite using the mark iii catalogue of more than 3000 galaxy velocities with no morphological selection ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the sne ia likelihood function used is calculated in @xcite and @xcite by maximising the likelihood function using 42 high redshift supernovae measured by the supernova cosmology project @xcite .",
    "note that sne ia measurements probe cosmological parameters through the luminosity distance . unlike redshift surveys ,",
    "sne ia are independent of the structure formation scenario so the sne ia and lss combination of data is a powerful tool for constraining cosmological models .",
    "in order to perform a joint analysis , one must ensure a basis set of independent parameters from which the other parameters can be calculated so the parameter space depends on the combination of data sets .",
    "the iras likelihood function was computed under the assumption of a flat universe .",
    "hence only flat models are considered when iras data are combined with , e.g. supernovae data even if the latter likelihood function allows more freedom in the parameter space .",
    "similarly , the las campanas likelihood function was calculated by comparing realisations of the survey from cold dark matter structure formation simulations .",
    "therefore no hot or warm dark matter models can be constrained with the las campanas likelihood function .",
    "the assumptions of each data set are propagated throughout the analysis because they change the way the parameter space can be defined and how the remaining parameters are calculated from the independent ones .",
    "this conservative approach in which only models common to all used data sets can be constrained , has the drawback that the results can not always be compared at face value .",
    "the limitation to flat universes corresponds to a slice of the larger parameter space allowing for open and closed universes .",
    "results from the larger parameter space , marginalised over curvature , can not be considered statistically equivalent to results for flat universes only .",
    "the priors on the considered models for each combination are summarised in table [ prior - table ] .",
    "if the likelihood functions are not evaluated beyond some value the nearest border value of the likelihood function is used .",
    "although the iras likelihood function is incomplete in the @xmath7 dimension , this choice of extrapolation has no consequences when using the full combination of data sets .",
    "the analysis is carried out with bayesys , a commercial mcmc software package @xcite .",
    "50,000 samples are obtained for each possible combination of data .",
    "since the resulting number density of samples in parameter space is proportional to the joint likelihood , the samples are then counted into bins and those one - dimensional distributions are automatically marginalised over the remaining parameters .",
    ".prior for each combination of four data sets : the las campanas ( l ) and iras ( i ) redshift surveys , galaxy peculiar velocities ( p ) and distant supernovae ( s ) and associated priors .",
    "`` cdm '' means only cold dark matter models were used in the likelihood function calculation .",
    "`` flat '' means that only models of flat universes were considered and the likelihood function was generated under that assumption . [ cols=\">,^,>,^ \" , ]",
    "four different cosmological sets of data provide constraints on @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 under the assumption of a flat universe , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 for all geometries .",
    "the full combination of these data sets provides remarkably tight constraints on @xmath22 , @xmath3 and @xmath7 .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath23 and @xmath7 are in excellent agreement with parameter estimation presented in @xcite : @xmath24 , @xmath25 although the constraint on the hubble parameter , @xmath26 , differs somewhat .",
    "in general , the three parameters display a different behaviour depending on the data and priors .",
    "the hubble parameter is ill - determined in each case and the tightest contraint is consistent at 1@xmath27 with most @xmath3 estimates ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the matter density @xmath6 is fairly well determined in each analysis and all results are in good agreement independently of which data are included or which priors are assumed . the amplitude of mass fluctutations parameter @xmath7 is more difficult to constrain . as in the litterature",
    "( see e.g. table 4 in @xcite ) , several values have been derived that are not necessarily consistent and depend strongly on which data are used . unlike the hubble parameter which is allowed a wide range of values whatever the analysis , observations lead to rather tight constraints on @xmath7 but different ones , thereby suggesting that the discrepancy is due to errors or misestimates in the data rather than to priors ."
