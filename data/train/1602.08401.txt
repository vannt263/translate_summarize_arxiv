    "in particular any connected cover of @xmath4 splits .",
    "the spectral theorem implies that the restriction of @xmath0 to @xmath4 is supported on the union of some @xmath3 - orbits in the dual of @xmath4 , which may be viewed as the space of the symmetric forms on @xmath6 .",
    "the rank of @xmath0 is the maximal rank of a symmetric form in this support .",

    "* theorem 1.3 ) , there is an irreducible unitary representation @xmath18 of @xmath19 such that @xmath20 is induced from a representation involving @xmath18 of the subgroup @xmath21 .",
    "the argument is based on the stone von neumann theorem @xcite , the theory of the weil representation @xcite and the mackey imprimitivity theorem , @xcite .",
    "in particular the operators of @xmath20 are as explicit as the operators of @xmath18 .",
    "however the remaining operators remain obscure .",
    "fortunately there is a different description of the representations @xmath0 and @xmath18 .",

    "as shown by jian - shu li in his thesis , the representations @xmath0 and @xmath18 are in howe s correspondence .",
    "li extended howe s theory of rank to all dual pairs of type i and proved that it provides a bijection of representations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 equal to howe s correspondence , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the condition of low rank is transformed to the dual pair being in the stable range , with @xmath26 - the smaller member .",
    "now the operators @xmath27 , @xmath28 , are much better understood because the weil representation is known explicitly , see @xcite or section [ the weil representation ] below , for a coordinate free approach .",

    "* theorem 2 ) , it suffices to know that the two distributions are equal on a zariski open subset @xmath38 .",
    "this is verified using the method developed in @xcite combined with a localization which requires the notion of a rapidly decreasing functions on @xmath24 , as defined in @xcite .",
    "another invariant that tests our understanding of a representation is @xmath39 , the wave front set of @xmath0 .",
    "this notion , adapted from the theory differential operators , @xcite , was introduced to representation theory by howe in @xcite . since the wave front set of a representation of a reductive group",

    "one may probably circumvent @xcite and @xcite by producing the correct extension of @xmath32 from @xmath54 to @xmath25 , but this would require a good understanding of the twisted orbital integrals , @xcite , and is beyond the scope of this article .    the distribution @xmath32 is defined also beyond the stable range and does not depend on the unitarity of @xmath18 .",
