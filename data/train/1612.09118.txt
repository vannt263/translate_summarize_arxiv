    "therefore , we have found counterparts of the _ spitzer _ sources in the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) satellite survey at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath6 m and considered all ccds based on different combinations of these bands .",
    "amongst a total of 15 ccds , the best option for separating c - rich agb and post - agb stars from the o - rich ones is the @xmath9-[12]$ ] vs. @xmath10-[22]$ ] ccd . in figure",
