    "applied to si : p , the theory correctly predict a linear correspondence between @xmath33 and @xmath32 , but incorrectly predicts the proportionality by at least a factor of thirty .",
    "the proportionality is near the predicted value for nbsi , but has a dependence on the doping concentration which is presumably due to entering the quantum critical ( qc ) regime as discussed below .",
    "here we have used the susceptibility @xmath37 of the dopant electrons ( i.e. with the background dielectric constant of silicon subtracted ) in the expression for the magnitude of the imaginary component of the conductivity in eq .",

    "this should be a smooth crossover and therefore looking at a fixed window of frequencies , a continuous change from @xmath41 is expected , similar to that measured for nbsi shown in the middle panel of fig [ armitagecg2 ] .    setting the relations for localization length and dephasing length equal @xcite",
    ", one finds the crossover condition for the frequency in terms of the normalized concentration , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the dynamic exponent . as the prefactor can vary from system to system , the fact that we see an @xmath44 across our entire doping range in si : p , but an @xmath31 that approaches @xmath45 in nbsi indicates that the critical regime in si : p is much narrower and out of our experimental window .",
    "this is consistent with simple dimensional arguments@xcite that show the crossover should be inversely proportional to the dopant density of states . the much smaller dopant density in si : p vs. nbsi ( a factor of @xmath46 ) is consistent with a narrower qc regime as compared to nbsi .    the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ armitagecg2 ] shows magnitude of the real part of the conductivity as the mit is approached .",
    "this demonstrates that the prefactor a can be written as a function of the normalized concentration , i.e. @xmath47 for si : p .",
    "in @xmath48 interacting systems , the effects of correlations become simpler as one goes to lower energies and/or lower temperatures .",
    "the canonical example of this is a fermi liquid where at t=0 and @xmath29=0 one recovers the non - interacting theory , but with parameters that are substantially modified ( renormalized ) from the free electron ones .",
    "the coulomb glass is a fundamentally important example in solid state physics because it belongs to a class of systems where this does not occur and the non - interacting functional forms are not recovered at asymptotically low energies .    as predicted in the crossover function eq .",
    "[ eq : esxover ] , we have observed in si : p that the non - interacting functional form is recovered in the high - frequency limit and the low - frequency response shows interactions . within the theory",
    "this is a result of the additional internal excitation structure of a resonant pair caused by interactions and the fact that any one pair can be thought of as a distinct entity , well separated in energy from other spatially nearby pairs because of the large disorder induced energy spread .",
    "this internal structure enables the excitation of pairs relatively deep within the fermi sea and changes the factor in the initial state phase space from @xmath29 to @xmath49 .",
    "in contrast , in amorphous nbsi a smooth crossover is observed as the mit is approached from a linear frequency dependence to a power law characterized by an exponent smaller than unity .",
    "this is consistent with the eventual frequency dependence @xmath50 expected from quantum critical scaling arguments .",
    "no crossover to @xmath51 was observed in nbsi .    since it is the exponent @xmath31 that distills the important physics ( it indicates the phase space of initial states for @xmath31 = 1 or 2 and the presence of critical dynamics for @xmath52 )",
