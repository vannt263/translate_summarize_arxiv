    "one of the important unsolved problems in cosmology is understanding the formation of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to make progress on this complex issue , it is advantageous to investigate simple systems that allow us to study the basic processes that led to their origin and evolution .",
    "dwarf galaxies are such objects and can be studied both observationally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "they are generally old , metal - poor , have no gas and thus no longer support star formation ( @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these conditions make them ideal candidates to constrain theoretical models for star and galaxy formation in the early universe @xcite .",
    "one particularly important question is to elucidate the role of feedback processes in galaxy formation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "again , early dwarf galaxies may provide us with an ideal laboratory to test the physics of feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the population of faint dwarf galaxies discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) that surround the milky way ( mw ) offer a unique way to investigate these topics . due to their simple nature",
    ", these so - called ultra - faint dwarf galaxies ( ufds ) , here defined to have @xmath0 ( @xcite ) , are the closest local analogs to the first galaxies .",
    "they are believed to have had only one or a few early star formation events , but have been quiescent ever since ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , they should retain signatures of the earliest stages of chemical enrichment in their stellar populations .",
    "indeed , these systems are very metal - poor , and extend the metallicity - luminosity relationship of the classical dwarfs down to @xmath1 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy @xcite further showed that the abundances of faint dwarf galaxy stars resemble those of similarly metal - poor galactic halo stars .",
    "this suggests that chemical evolution is universal , at least at the earliest times which are probed by the most metal - poor , and thus presumably the oldest , stars .",
    "the same chemical trends have also been found in a few stars with @xmath2}\\leq-3.5 $ ] @xcite located in the more luminous , classical dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) sculptor and fornax .",
    "however , at higher metallicity ( @xmath3}>\\sim-2.5 $ ] ) , the stellar ( [ @xmath4/fe ] ) abundances of both systems deviate from those of galactic halo stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , indicating a different evolutionary timescale and multiple star formation events leading to extensive metal - rich stellar components @xcite .",
    "this high level of complexity has been established for all the classical dsphs down @xmath5 , making it difficult to directly connect them to the first galaxies .",
    "the ufds thus provide us with a tool for performing `` dwarf archaeology '' .",
    "this terminology builds on the more general concept of `` stellar archaeology '' which posits that the chemical composition of the early universe is preserved in the atmospheres of individual metal - poor stars .",
    "specifically , dwarf archaeology involves the _ entire _ stellar content of a dwarf galaxy , including the more metal - rich stars , in contrast to the focus on single metal - poor stars in the traditional approach . with their relatively limited number of stars ,",
    "the least luminous galaxies are ideal candidates for dwarf archaeology . as opposed to the mw halo , which was assembled through multiple merger and accretion events , the lowest luminosity dwarfs likely did not form via extensive hierarchical merging @xcite . their entire stellar population ,",
    "therefore , directly traces early star and galaxy formation . the more metal - rich stars with @xmath3}\\gtrsim-2.0 $ ] in these faint metal - poor galaxies will provide the strongest constraints on the star formation history , and hence the formation and evolution of the host system",
    "in particular , dwarf archaeology facilitates establishing the connection between the surviving ufds , the first galaxies and the building blocks that formed the mw halo .",
    "this is important since recent abundance studies have suggested early , accreted analogs of today s ufds to have played a significant role in building up the metal - poor tail of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the galactic halo contains a significant number of extremely metal - poor stars ( with @xmath3}<-3.0 $ ] ; e.g. , @xcite ) , including some objects with @xmath3}<-5.0 $ ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "their abundances have been attributed to individual populationiii ( popiii ) sn yields ( e.g. , @xcite ) which provides a key empirical diagnostic for popiii nucleosynthesis and overall constraints on the nature of these progenitors .",
    "consequently , since these stars are likely nearly as old as the universe , their origin may reside in small , early systems .",
    "a better understanding of this connection is vital for understanding chemical enrichment and star formation in the very early universe @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we specifically suggest that the stellar abundance record preserved in the metal - deficient dwarf galaxies contain crucial hints on how effective early feedback effects were in suppressing star formation .",
    "this endeavor is complemented by the confluence of two recent developments : the availability of large - scale parallel supercomputers allowing ever more realistic simulations of early structure formation , and increasingly detailed observations of stars in these ufds .",
    "the purpose of this section is to summarize those aspects of recent ab initio simulations of first galaxy formation ( see bromm & yoshida 2011 for a review and further references ) that provide us with the theoretical underpinning and guidance in formulating the chemical abundance signature of the first galaxies .",
    "we begin by discussing ideas on where the first stars and galaxies form , and then turn to early metal enrichment .      in a @xmath6cdm universe ,",
    "structure formation proceeds hierarchically , with small dark matter halos merging to form larger ones .",
    "the first stars are expected to form in minihalos , collapsing at @xmath7 @xcite and comprising masses of @xmath8m@xmath9 .",
    "these minihalos host a small multiple of predominantly massive popiii stars @xcite .",
    "the individual masses of these first stars are thought to be of order @xmath10m@xmath9 @xcite , distributed according to a still uncertain initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "it is likely , however , that a range of masses towards lower and higher values would have been present ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "massive popiii stars will exert strong feedback on their host halos and the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) , through both radiative and sn feedback @xcite , removing gas from the shallow potential well of the minihalo , thereby quenching star formation .",
    "a second round of star formation must have occurred in more massive systems whose deeper potential wells were able to reassemble the photo- and sn - heated gas from the diffuse igm . it has been argued that this can occur within so - called atomic cooling halos @xcite , having total masses of @xmath11m@xmath9 and collapsing at redshifts of @xmath12 .",
    "such systems have virial temperatures of @xmath13k , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the halo mass and radius . at these temperatures",
    "the gas can cool via excitation of atomic hydrogen lines , without molecular hydrogen .",
    "atomic cooling halos have been proposed as the sites of the first bona - fide galaxies @xcite , where a `` galaxy '' connotes a long - lived stellar system which can sustain an interstellar medium , and extended , self - regulated , episodes of star formation .      assuming that they are plausible candidates for ufd progenitors , hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of atomic cooling halos prior to reionization are ideal for developing an understanding for the nature of the building blocks and their connection to the first galaxies , as well as any surviving dwarf galaxies .",
    "since the simulations are approaching the goal of ab initio calculations without the need for recipes to model star formation and feedback effects @xcite , the results are not affected by a particular prescriptions for these processes .",
    "simulations indicate that an atomic cooling halo has of order 10 progenitor minihalos @xcite .",
    "each minihalo in turn will harbor of order one sn explosion .",
    "the latter prediction is robust , and does not rely on a detailed knowledge of the popiii imf .",
    "a minihalo will have a few @xmath16m@xmath9 of cold , dense gas available for star formation @xcite . assuming a star formation efficiency of order 10 per cent",
    ", one has a few @xmath17m@xmath9 in stars . for a top - heavy imf",
    ", this would result in of order one sn ; for a normal , salpeter - like imf , one needs @xmath18m@xmath9 of stellar mass to trigger one sn . in both situations",
    ", we would have the same number of sne per minihalo .",
    "consequently , a given popii star that formed in an atomic cooling halo would be enriched by at most @xmath19 sne , with an element distribution that depends on the details of the turbulent mixing of the metals .",
    "one key simulation result is that the center of the emerging atomic cooling halo is already enriched with heavy elements , to average levels of @xmath20 but with a spread of roughly @xmath21dex around this mean @xcite .",
    "overall , this level of enrichment appears to be a robust expectation @xcite , and it could only be prevented in cases where a strong lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation background is present , so that h@xmath22 can be destroyed inside the progenitor minihalos , suppressing star formation and concomitant metal enrichment prior to the collapse of the atomic cooling halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this situation is thought to be quite rare , however @xcite .",
    "the typical atomic cooling halo will therefore already be metal - enriched , and will eventually host popii stellar systems .",
    "the enrichment history prior to the formation of those second - generation stars is thus relatively simple , and solely determined by massive sn yields .    atomic cooling halos , at least at the low - mass end ,",
    "may provide environments for chemical `` one - shot '' events : their popii starburst , synchronized to within roughly the dynamical time of the central gas cloud of a few @xmath23yr @xcite might be able to drive any remaining gas out of their shallow potential wells .",
    "this conjecture needs to be tested with forthcoming highly - resolved simulations of the central starburst . to foresee the outcome ,",
    "let us consider the following approximate arguments : just prior to the onset of the initial starburst , of order @xmath24 of cold , dense gas would have assembled . again assuming a star formation efficiency of 10 per cent on these scales",
    ", we expect a star cluster of total mass @xmath25 to form .",
    "such central clusters would have luminosities of @xmath26 , similar to the total stellar luminosity observed in ufds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for a standard imf , the starburst would be accompanied by @xmath10 core - collapse sne with an explosion energy of @xmath27erg each .",
    "the total sn energy would then be comparable to the gravitational binding energy of an atomic cooling halo at @xmath28 @xcite , rendering a complete removal of all remaining gas at least plausible .",
    "a second feedback effect that will act to evacuate the post - starburst halo is heating due to photoionization @xcite .",
    "such simple one - shot enrichment systems are the `` rosetta stone '' of cosmic chemical evolution , and are ideal objects for carrying out dwarf archaeology .",
    "their surviving popii stars would preserve the yields from the initial popiii sne that had occurred in the progenitor minihalos without any subsequent enrichment from events that operate on timescales longer than the short dynamical time , such as typeia sne or asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) winds .",
    "a possible caveat that could act to mask the popiii sn yields is pollution of these ancient stars with accreted interstellar material .",
    "however , such contribution is likely extremely small , and can therefore be neglected ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "according to the simulations ( see section  2 ) , any first galaxy is expected to have been chemically enriched by one or a few sne , but no more than @xmath29 , corresponding to the number of precursor minihalos . to bracket the uncertainties in the primordial imf",
    ", we consider two sn types occurring during the assembly of a first galaxy : conventional core - collapse sne in the mass range of 10 - 140m@xmath9 and pair - instability supernovae ( pisne ) occurring between 140 - 260m@xmath9 . since pisne are assumed to be rare , we expect that no more than one minihalo hosted such an explosion , whereas all other events were core - collapse sne .",
    "such a distribution can be regarded as an example of early chemical enrichment , but different proportions of the two sne types are of course possible . for simplicity",
    ", we do not consider such cases here .",
    "we note , however , that any stars with @xmath30m@xmath9 , while perhaps present in minihalos , would directly collapse into black holes and thus not contribute to the enrichment .",
    "the bulk of the metals is contained in @xmath31m@xmath9 of gas , the typical mass of a star forming cloud in an atomic cooling halo @xcite .",
    "we now consider the likely chemical signature of the second - generation , low - mass metal - poor stars in the first galaxy .",
    "since these objects would be long - lived and thus still be observable today , they provide a fossil diagnostic of these early systems . according to the one - shot assumption",
    ", no subsequent sne would have contributed to the chemical inventory at the formation time of the next generation of stars which included the first low - mass stars .",
    "the abundances of the second - generation metal - poor stars should thus preserve the chemical signatures of the popiii progenitors in their atmospheres .",
    "core - collapse sne produce a maximum of @xmath320.1m@xmath9 of fe @xcite . considering the canonical example of diluting this mass of fe into a hydrogen gas of @xmath33m@xmath9 leads to a next - generation with a metallicity of @xmath3}=-3.25 $ ]",
    ". a maximum of @xmath3}=-2.25 $ ] would be present as a result of ten such sne and should reflect the average metallicity of the system .",
    "large abundance spreads in [ x / h ] are expected due to incomplete mixing on the short dynamical timescale within the center of the first galaxy @xcite .",
    "the second - generation starburst will occur on roughly this timescale , so that metallicity inhomogeneities in the gas will be reflected in the respective stellar abundances .",
    "we note that any inhomogeneous mixing occurring in a system would primarily affect element ratios containing h , i.e. , [ x / h ] , but to a much lesser degree those with two heavy elements , i.e. , [ x / fe ] , assuming that no differential mixing takes place on length and time scales relevant for star formation .",
    "hence , any spread for example in [ fe / h ] is possible , but little or no scatter in , e.g. , [ @xmath4/fe ] .",
    "consequently , large variations of @xmath34}\\sim$]1dex or more around the average systemic metallicities of @xmath3}\\sim-2.3 $ ] are expected to occur .",
    "the core - collapse ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) have well correlated fe and @xmath4-abundances ( mg , ca , ti , si ) , resulting in the characteristic metal - poor halo star signature of @xmath35}\\sim0.3 $ ] @xcite . this abundance level is indicated in the top panel of figure  1 . for the first galaxies , we therefore predict average values of [ @xmath4/fe ] as set by the sample of @xcite with a range of @xmath36dex , the measured standard deviation .",
    "a first galaxy should thus contain no stars , not even at higher metallicity ( @xmath3}>\\sim-2.0 $ ] ) , that show @xmath4-abundance ratios with the solar ratio , @xmath35}=0.0 $ ] , or lower .",
    "such low values would indicate star formation after any of the more massive popii stars eventually exploded as sneia , adding iron to the galaxy , in contradiction to the one - shot assumption .",
    "late - time agb or snia enrichment from lower mass stars would eventually occur , but only after the initial popii starburst , and after the remaining gas was blown out of the system ( see the discussion in section 2 ) .",
    "consequently , there should not be any signs of general s - process enrichment by agb stars despite the fact that some of these popii stars with intermediate masses must have gone through an agb phase to later provide s - process material as well as carbon .",
    "the only exceptions would be individual metal - poor stars with strong s - process ( and carbon ) enhancements that are in close binary systems , undergoing mass transfer .",
    "if an r - process occurred in one of the core - collapse sne ( e.g. , one with a 10 - 20m@xmath9 progenitor ) , small amounts of neutron - capture material would be produced .",
    "unfortunately , no theoretical r - process yields are available for direct comparison with observations .",
    "the one exception is the `` weak '' r - process investigation by @xcite , focusing only on the production of the light neutron - capture elements sr , y , and zr .",
    "for two different progenitor masses and `` normal '' explosion energy of @xmath37 , their models yield sr ejecta of @xmath38m@xmath9 ( their 13m@xmath9 model ) and @xmath39m@xmath9 ( 25m@xmath9 model ) , with respective fe yields of @xmath40m@xmath9 and @xmath41m@xmath9 . diluting these yields in 10@xmath42m@xmath9 of h gas ,",
    "yields low values of @xmath43}\\sim-5.8 $ ] and @xmath44 depending on the model .",
    "the corresponding [ sr / fe ] values are @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with corresponding [ fe / h ] values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "their higher explosion energy 25m@xmath9 model produces more sr ( which they conclude to be the appropriate progenitors for their group of `` weak '' r - process stars ) , although the results appear to be very sensitive to model parameters . using their `` normal''-energy sn yields as guidelines , very low levels of [ sr / fe ] , and by extension even lower ba values , following the ratios of typical stars in the halo sample @xcite with @xmath49}\\sim0.4 $ ] , must have been present in a first galaxy .",
    "we arrive at a more general , heuristic limit on the r - process contribution in a first galaxy , specifically on the sr and ba abundances , as follows : in the mw , the s - process is known to dominate the chemical evolution of neutron - capture elements above @xmath3}>-2.6 $ ] @xcite .",
    "we use metal - poor stars from the literature to estimate the general trends of [ sr / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] in stars with @xmath50}<-1.7 $ ] .",
    "these characterize any s - process dominated material .",
    "consequently , we regard stars with abundances lower than the general trend to represent r - process enhancement .",
    "these lower - than - average values are @xmath51}<-0.5 $ ] and @xmath52}<-1.0 $ ] , as indicated in figure  1 .",
    "these limits are somewhat higher than the values derived from the @xcite calculations , but they represent a more robust upper limit to a pure r - process enrichment by core - collapse sne .",
    "we now consider the yields of a pisn , in addition to core - collapse sn enrichment , and how they would change the chemical make - up of a first galaxy .",
    "there are two main chemical signatures expected to be found in metal - poor stars if a pisn had enriched the system as well .",
    "since there are 10 independent star forming halos ( the @xmath29 progenitor minihalos that merge to form the first galaxy ) , it is very likely that the pisn will be accompanied by up to @xmath29 core - collapse sne .",
    "consequently , the previously described enrichment pattern would also be present , but additionally , individual stars would display a more or less clean pisn signature .",
    "the strength of the pisn signature in a given star will depend on the details of the stochastic , inhomogeneous mixing of the ejecta from all contributing sne @xcite . due to nearly constant yields of c ,",
    "mg , and ca independent of the progenitor mass @xcite , respective next - generation stellar abundances would be high , e.g. , @xmath53}\\sim-2.0 $ ] , albeit with a spread of @xmath54dex .",
    "fe , on the other hand , with almost arbitrary yields , is not directly predictable . with increasing progenitor mass ,",
    "vast quantities of fe , and also o , are produced , up to several tens of solar masses ( see fig .  1 in @xcite )",
    ". consequently , such a star could have @xmath3}\\sim-3.0 $ ] or even less , or @xmath3}\\sim-1.0 $ ] or more .",
    "either way , the [ mg / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] ratios would likely differ from that of typical halo stars .",
    "another characteristic signature of pisn - enriched gas is a complete lack of neutron - capture elements .",
    "hence , any star formed from such material would have no detectable neutron - capture elements .",
    "in figure  1 , we summarize the currently available abundances obtained from high - resolution spectroscopy of stars in several ufds .",
    "we show [ @xmath4/fe ] as a tracer of core - collapse enrichment ( top panel ) , and the neutron - capture elements [ sr / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] as a gauge for pure r - process material ( bottom panels ) .",
    "we compare the data to our predictions in section  3 to asses whether any of the surviving systems chemically resemble a first galaxy .",
    "we begin with enrichment by core - collapse sne . to what extent",
    "do the ufd stars show an [ @xmath4/fe]-enhancement of @xmath55dex , especially at metallicities of @xmath3}>-2.5 $ ] ?",
    "this signature has indeed been found for most stars in the ufds that have detailed chemical abundances available , and it has been suggested that the observed elements originated from canonical core - collapse events in the same way as found for halo stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . unfortunately , not many metal - rich stars are present and also observable in these systems , resulting in no data at @xmath3}>-2.0 $ ] .",
    "bearing in mind that only one calculation of r - process yields is currently available , the prediction of low neutron - capture abundances is in reasonable agreement with the overall depleted abundances of sr and ba ( e.g. , many stars have @xmath52}<-1.0 $ ] ) in all of the ufds .",
    "we also note that no metal - poor star with s - process enhancement from a binary mass transfer has yet been conclusively identified in any of the known ufds .",
    "recent medium - resolution spectroscopic studies @xcite showed that all of the ufds have large [ fe / h ] spreads of @xmath56dex or more , and reaching below @xmath3}=-3.0 $ ] .",
    "moreover , some have average metallicities as low as @xmath3}\\sim-2.6 $ ] ( leoiv , hercules ) , which is less than that of the most metal - poor globular clusters .",
    "none of the systems with @xmath57 have averages of @xmath3}>-2.0 $ ] .",
    "these low metallicities agree well with the estimates for fe enrichment from up to 10 core - collapse sne in a first galaxy .",
    "the large abundance spread is also in agreement with simulation results , reflecting inefficient mixing .    out of the six ufds with available abundance data ,",
    "ursa majorii best fulfills the criteria for being a candidate first galaxy fossil .",
    "the one star with a higher ba abundance is possibly an externally enriched binary star , so no strong conclusions can currently be derived from this object .",
    "coma berenices and bootesi are good candidates as well , although the bootesi stars have higher ba abundances than our limit , and coma berenices highest metallicity star shows a decreased [ @xmath4/fe ] .",
    "however , future r - process predictions will reveal whether this is necessarily inconsistent with a one - shot enrichment .",
    "intriguingly , hercules appears to be different .",
    "not shown in figure  1 are the ca abundances of several stars @xcite , which show large variations ranging from subsolar to @xmath58}\\sim0.3 $ ] .",
    "we tentatively rule out hercules as a candidate , along the same line as the more luminous classical dwarfs .",
    "we note , however , that @xcite had one star in common with @xcite , but derived a 0.4dex lower ca abundance , which is their lowest value in the sample .",
    "this is somewhat puzzling , but given that the ca spread is about twice the discrepancy , it seems reasonable to assume that this galaxy indeed has a significant abundance spread in this element .",
    "leoiv and segue1 at present contain too few data to arrive at a meaningful conclusion .",
    "hence , additional high - resolution abundance studies of more stars in each of these as well as other systems are required .",
    "but new segue1 results ( a. frebel et al . 2011 , in prep . ) already indicate this system to be in agreement with a pure core - collapse sn enrichment . only with more metal - rich stars",
    "can it be revealed whether the one - shot conjecture holds or if evidence for extended star formation and chemical evolution can be found .",
    "either result would provide important constraints on early feedback processes .",
    "_ are there any hints for a potential pisn enrichment ?",
    "_ since the faintest galaxies have very low average metallicities and truncated star formation , ufds provide the perhaps best chance to ever detect the chemical signature of a pisn event .",
    "identifying the pisn signature is , however , difficult given that the predicted very high yields may lead to stars with much higher metallicity compared with a regular core - collapse enrichment ( see karlsson et al .",
    "even if a first galaxy did not survive until the present time , it is likely that individual stars that formed in these environments passed into larger systems through merger events , possibly into surviving galaxies , e.g. , hercules with @xmath59 , or more luminous systems such as draco and sculptor .",
    "hence , individual stars in systems more luminous than the faintest ufds with extensive star formation and chemical evolution could still preserve the rare signature of pisne .",
    "one interesting galaxy in this context is hercules , for which @xcite measured the abundances of many elements of two member stars .",
    "both ba limits are @xmath52}<-2.1 $ ] , and among the lowest values ever measured.}<-4.15 $ ] do not have the lowest [ ba / h ] values or limits .",
    "many halo stars have abundances @xmath60}\\le-5.0 $ ] ( @xmath29 stars found in the compilation of @xcite ; e.g. , from @xcite ) . ]",
    "while the average metallicity of hercules is @xmath3}\\sim-2.6 $ ] ( but with a spread of more than @xmath56dex in fe ; @xcite ) , these two stars have rather high metallicities of @xmath3}\\sim-2.0 $ ] .",
    "both stars have high mg / fe ( @xmath61 ) and low ca / fe ratios ( @xmath62 ) , but their ti / fe corresponds to the typical halo value .",
    "@xcite speculated that in order to produce large mg / ca ratios in a `` next - generation '' star ( i.e. , the observed star ) , hercules would have to have been enriched by fewer than 11 core - collapse sn events , consistent with our picture of first galaxy enrichment . considering the above pisn enrichment criteria , hercules could be a candidate site for a pisn pre - enrichment , and for testing the predictions for pisn yields @xcite .",
    "however , the recent low stellar ca / fe abundances of @xcite in hercules complicate the situation , and indicate that this system is not a candidate first galaxy .",
    "additional observations will be helpful to fully understand the chemical evolution of this galaxy .",
    "another interesting case is a star with @xmath3}\\sim-3.0 $ ] , located in the classical dsph draco , and having an upper limit of @xmath52}<-2.6 $ ] @xcite .",
    "strontium is similarly depleted and no other neutron - capture elements could be detected . on the contrary ,",
    "all other , more metal - rich stars in draco do not show this behavior @xcite .",
    "this star is thus highly unusual , but similar to the stars in hercules , except for its lower metallicity .",
    "this difference might be due to the arbitrary fe yields of pisne , inhomogeneous mixing or simply the gas mass available for mixing , which could be @xmath29 times more than in a hercules - like object .",
    "@xcite found that no ordinary sn model could account for the lack of neutron - capture elements in this star , and its origin is still uncertain .",
    "given that this galaxy is only @xmath3210 times more luminous than hercules , and thus lies on the low - luminosity tail of the classical dsphs , it could plausibly have assembled from several first galaxies .",
    "hence , some individual stars could have preserved their pisn signature throughout their cosmic merger journey while showing signs of extended star formation at the same time .",
    "next to atomic cooling halos , minihalos have been suggested as ufd progenitors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the minihalo environment may , however , face a problem , at least for the lowest - mass minihalos that are close to the threshold mass ( @xmath63 ) required for h@xmath22 cooling to become effective . in such minihalos",
    "the available gas mass is only @xmath64m@xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , much lower than in the more massive atomic halos .",
    "consequently , any sn yield is much less diluted , generally resulting in stars with higher metallicity than those in atomic cooling halos . diluting 0.1m@xmath9 of fe into the available gas mass yields a next - generation star with @xmath3}\\sim-1.2 $ ] ( for @xmath65m@xmath9 ) .",
    "even the assumption that inhomogeneous mixing would be able to produce a spread of @xmath21dex around this value could not explain extremely metal - poor stars with @xmath3}<-3 $ ] , including the most metal - poor star in any ufd , booi-1137 with @xmath3}\\sim-3.7 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the only possibility would be to limit the maximum fe sn yield to @xmath66m@xmath9 ( or 0.01m@xmath9 for the larger dilution mass of @xmath67m@xmath9 ) in any minihalo in the early universe .",
    "atomic cooling halos with their larger gas reservoirs thus appear , at least broadly , to be able to account for the existence of the lowest - metallicity stars .",
    "we point out that the minihalos invoked as ufd progenitors @xcite typically lie at the high mass end of the minihalo range , thus largely circumventing this mixing problem as well . within the minihalo scenario ,",
    "the same system would have to first lead to the explosion of popiii sne , subsequently reassemble the enriched gas inside its shallow potential well , and finally trigger a second generation of star formation .",
    "for the atomic cooling halo pathway , on the other hand , the sites for first and second generation star formation are decoupled , thus alleviating the problem of admitting popiii pre - enrichment .",
    "altogether , we thus favor the atomic cooling halo path that can more readily explain the presence of metal - poor stars .",
    "we stress , however , that there will be a continuum of more complex enrichment histories , where multiple sn generations and contributions from low - mass stars , corresponding to host systems of subsequently larger mass , and therefore deeper potential wells ( for an alternative view , see @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , this sequence of cosmological formation sites corresponds to the progression from the lowest - luminosity dwarfs , to classical dwarf spheroidals , and to magellanic - cloud type irregulars .    assuming that the ufds are chemical one - shot events , the observed spread in fe ( i.e. , [ fe / h ] ) suggests that mixing in these early systems was inefficient .",
    "otherwise all stars would have nearly identical abundances , similar to what is found in globular clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we can thus infer that mixing in the very first galaxies was largely incomplete , whereas globular clusters must have formed in much different environments where turbulent mixing would have been much more efficient .",
    "we repeat that such inefficiency would not yield a scatter in the elemental abundance ratios [ x / fe ] , unless differential mixing among different elements played an important role .",
    "hercules , having the highest luminosity of the examined systems , exhibits an abundance behavior , e.g. , a large spread in ca , that is suggesting possible snia enrichment .",
    "we therefore derive an upper limit to the luminosity for candidate first galaxies of @xmath68 .",
    "bootesi , with a similar luminosity will be an interesting object in this regard , and additional observations will show if this system remains a good candidate .",
    "it is interesting to note that coma berenices has recently been shown to be a stable ufd with no signs of tidal stripping @xcite , while ursa majorii appears to currently undergo disruption . as for leoiv ,",
    "simon et al . ( 2010 ) suggested that its entire fe content could provided by a single sn .",
    "if confirmed with additional observations , the case of leoiv would show that one - shot events do take place , and that such simplistic galaxies , like the first galaxies , can survive to the present day .",
    "the currently known ufd abundance record leads us to derive , with the caveats and qualifications discussed above , the following conclusions .",
    "independent of the question of whether ufds are surviving minihalos or atomic cooling halos , we suggest that at least some of today s ufds ( ursa majorii , leoiv and possibly also coma berenices , bootesi ) are likely to have been the results of chemical one - shot events that occurred in the early universe .",
    "given that atomic cooling halos seem to be the more favorable environments for producing low - metallicity stars that resemble the observed stellar populations of the ufds , these systems are plausible formation sites for the least luminous galaxies .",
    "as additional chemical abundances of individual dwarf galaxy stars are measured , abundance gradient studies of the ufd galaxies will further constrain the mixing efficiency . stronger gravitational fields in the center of a system",
    "would drive more turbulence that in turn would induce mixing . to properly interpret the data , in particular for future observations with extremely large telescopes , the expected signature of clustered star formation in the first galaxies needs to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "since the ufds are ideal testbeds for various feedback processes , it will also be interesting to study the carbon abundances in these systems .",
    "carbon , as well as oxygen , may have been a key cooling agent inside the first galaxies @xcite .",
    "while one extremely carbon - rich star ( with @xmath3}\\sim-3.5 $ ] ) has already been found in segue1 @xcite , consistent with the predictions by @xcite , low stellar c abundances , if ever found , would rule out the theory of fine - structure line cooling for driving the transition to low - mass star formation in a near - primordial system .",
    "the existence of such one - shot enrichment sites can be refuted with future observations of ufd stars revealing the signatures of , e.g. , s - process enrichment or a decrease in [ @xmath4/fe ] abundance ratios ( to the solar level ) in these galaxies .",
    "however , we would still have gained crucial empirical constraints for the next generation of ab initio cosmological simulations that will be able to resolve the fine structure of star formation and feedback . in the latter case , dwarf archaeology would have indicated that negative feedback is not able to completely suppress the ongoing formation of stars .",
    "simulations could then adjust their treatment of feedback accordingly .",
    "alternatively , the absence of any one - shot systems could simply indicate that we have not yet discovered the true survivors of the first galaxies .",
    "simulations with extremely high - resolution that will study the fine - grained turbulent mixing of metals on scales of a few au will soon become feasible .",
    "the dwarf archaeological comparison between ufds and early star forming halos is thus important for providing constraints as well as consistency checks for state - of - the - art simulations .",
    "the emerging field of dwarf archaeology , which closely connects chemical abundances and galaxy formation models , promises a more complete understanding of galaxy formation and evolution at the end of the cosmic dark ages .",
