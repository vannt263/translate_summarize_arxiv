    "proton scattering has been widely used as a means to study both collective and microscopic aspects of nuclear structure  @xcite .",
    "the study is consistent only if a well - defined effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction is applied in the analysis .",
    "also , with the advent of radioactive nuclear beams there is constant enhancement of our knowledge frontiers on the structure and reaction dynamics of the known stable nuclei as well as their less known unstable counterparts  @xcite .",
    "this rapidly developing field provides a testing ground for different nuclear reaction theories and effective interactions . scattering involving @xmath0ne and @xmath0o are interesting because not only are they mirror nuclei , but also @xmath0o is a stable nucleus while @xmath0ne is its radioactive counterpart .    in this work ,",
    "proton scattering on @xmath0ne and @xmath0o has been studied at low energies ( @xmath1100 mev / a )  @xcite in a folding model approach .",
    "the folding model is well known as a powerful tool for analyzing nucleus - nucleus scattering data at relatively low incident energies  @xcite .",
    "it directly links the density profile of the nucleus with the scattering cross sections and is thus very appropriate for studying nuclei , especially those with exotic matter distributions .",
    "a semi - microscopic analysis in the optical model ( om ) framework is carried out . in the dwba calculations of nuclear excitation , with transferred angular momentum @xmath2 ,",
    "the form factors are obtained by taking the derivatives of the potentials used .",
    "the nucleon - nucleus potential can be obtained by single folding the density distribution of the nucleus with the nucleon - nucleon effective interaction  @xcite as , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is density of the nucleus at @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the effective interaction between two nucleons at the sites @xmath7 and @xmath5 .",
    "two different forms of effective interactions have been employed in this work .",
    "we perform a comparative study between the modified seyler - blanchard ( sbm ) and density dependent m3y ( ddm3y ) effective nn interactions .",
    "the finite range , density , momentum and isospin dependent effective interaction sbm has different strengths for pp ( or nn ) and pn interactions and its form is  @xcite , @xmath8\\ ] ] where , the subscripts ` @xmath2 ' and ` @xmath9 ' refer to like - pair ( nn or pp ) and unlike - pair ( np ) interactions , respectively . here ` @xmath10 ' is the range of the two - body interaction , ` @xmath11 ' is a measure of the strength of repulsion with relative momentum ` @xmath12 ' , while ` @xmath13 ' and ` @xmath14 ' are two parameters determining the strength of density dependence .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath4 are densities at the sites of the two interacting nucleons .",
    "the values of parameters @xmath16 are given in table 1 .",
    "these constants are found to reproduce the bulk properties of nuclear matter and of finite nuclei  @xcite and are known also to explain the p + @xmath17he,@xmath18li scattering data successfully  @xcite .",
    "the parameters are determined without exchange effects and thus they contain the effect indirectly though in a very approximate way .",
    "the finite range m3y effective interaction @xmath19 appearing in eqn",
    ". 1 is given by  @xcite @xmath20 this interaction is based upon a realistic g - matrix , which was constructed in an oscillator representation .",
    "effectively it is an average over a range of nuclear densities as well as energies and therefore the m3y has no explicit density or energy dependence .",
    "the only energy dependent effect that arises from its use is a rather weak one contained in an approximate treatment of single - nucleon knock - on exchange . the density and energy averages are adequate for the real part of the optical potential for heavy ions at lower energies . although , it is important to consider the density and energy dependence explicitly for scattering at higher energies , where the effects of a nuclear rainbow are seen and hence the scattering becomes sensitive to the potential at small radii .",
    "such cases were studied introducing suitable and semirealistic explicit density dependence @xcite into the m3y interaction which was then called the ddm3y and was very successful for interpreting consistently the high energy elastic @xmath21 and heavy ion scattering data .",
    "the present calculations use the density dependent m3y effective interaction ( ddm3y ) supplemented by a zero - range pseudo potential . in ddm3y ,",
    "the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction @xmath19 is assumed to be density and energy dependent and therefore becomes functions of density and energy and is given by    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the same m3y interaction given by eqn . 3 but supplemented by a zero range pseudo - potential @xcite    @xmath24    where the zero - range pseudo - potential representing the single - nucleon exchange term is given by    @xmath25    and the density dependent",
    "part has been taken to be @xcite    @xmath26    which takes care of the higher order exchange effects and the pauli blocking effects .",
    "@xmath27 is energy per nucleon .",
    "the constants of this interaction @xmath28 and @xmath29 when used in single folding model description , can be determined by nuclear matter calculations  @xcite as 2.07 and 1.624 @xmath30 respectively .",
    "the density dependence parameter @xmath29 has the dimension of cross - section .",
    "the term @xmath31 reduces the strength of the interaction and changes sign at high densities making it repulsive .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the pauli blocking effect .",
    "thus @xmath31 represents the probability of non - interaction arising due to collision probability @xmath32 of a nucleon in nuclear medium of density @xmath33 .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 can be identified as the ` in medium ' effective nucleon - nucleon interaction cross section @xmath34 .",
    "this value of @xmath29 along with nucleonic density of infinite nuclear matter @xmath35 can also provide the nuclear mean free path @xmath36 .",
    "the nuclear ground state densities have been calculated in the framework of spherical hartree fock plus bcs calculations in co - ordinate space using two different parameter sets of the skyrme interactions given by  @xcite @xmath37 + t_2(1 + x_2{\\bf p}_{\\sigma } ) { \\bf k'}\\delta({\\bf r } ) { \\bf k } + t_3(1 + x_3{\\bf p}_{\\sigma})\\rho^{\\alpha } ( { \\bf r})\\delta({\\bf r})\\ ] ] there are negligible differences in the ground state densities of the nuclei with the two different parameter sets ( for siii  @xcite and skm *  @xcite ) provided in table 2 .",
    "we show skm * parameterization for the @xmath0o ground state density ( fig . 1 ) and used it for calculations of the single folding potential and form factor .",
    "we carried out the same procedure for @xmath0ne and for skm * the binding energies per nucleon are in good agreement ( within 0.1 mev ) with the experimental values for both the nuclei .",
    "the potentials used while calculating phenomenological best fits  @xcite have the following form , @xmath38 where , @xmath39^{-1}$ ] , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath42 denote real , volume imaginary , surface imaginary and spin - orbit respectively and @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 are the strengths of the real , volume ( surface ) imaginary and spin - orbit potentials respectively .",
    "@xmath47 is the coulomb potential of a uniformly charged sphere of radius 1.20  @xmath48 .    in semi - microscopic analysis both the volume",
    "real ( @xmath49 ) and volume imaginary ( @xmath50 ) parts of the potentials ( generated microscopically by folding model ) are assumed to have the same shape , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath51 = ( @xmath52 + @xmath53)@xmath54(@xmath55 ) where , @xmath52 and @xmath56 are the renormalization factors for real and imaginary parts respectively  @xcite . in fig .",
    "2 the p + @xmath0o renormalized real folded potentials ( employing the sbm and ddm3y interactions ) are shown at @xmath57 = 24.5@xmath58 mev , along with the best fit phenomenological real part . thus the potentials for elastic scattering analysis include real and volume imaginary terms ( folded potentials ) and also surface imaginary and spin - orbit terms ( best fit phenomenological potentials ) .    for each angular distribution ,",
    "best fits are obtained by minimizing @xmath59/n , where @xmath59 = @xmath60 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the theoretical and experimental cross sections respectively , at angle @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the experimental error and n is the number of data points .",
    "the potentials for elastic scattering analysis are subsequently used in the dwba calculations of inelastic scattering with transferred angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "the calculations are performed using the code dwuck4  @xcite .",
    "the derivative of the potentials ( @xmath65 ) are used as the form factors .",
    "the microscopic real and imaginary form factors have the same shape with strengths @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively , where @xmath68 = @xmath69 , where the radius parameter @xmath70 is the rms radius of the folded potential .",
    "in addition , form factors derived from phenomenological surface imaginary and spin - orbit potentials are included .",
    "the deformation parameters @xmath71 are determined by fitting the inelastic scattering angular distribution .",
    "the renormalizations required for the potentials are reminiscent of those for deuteron and @xmath72li scattering and it may be surmised that it is for the same reasons ; weak binding and ease of breakup and other reaction channels .",
    "table 1 gives the parameters of the interactions used here .",
    "both interactions provide incompressibility of @xmath73 300 mev for spin and isospin symmetric cold infinite nuclear matter .",
    "moreover , in case of ddm3y , @xmath29 value of 1.624 @xmath30 obtained from nuclear matter calculations , along with nucleonic density of 0.16 @xmath74 provides a mean free path of about 4 fm which is in excellent agreement with other theoretical estimates  @xcite .",
    "table 3 gives the phenomenological best fit optical model parameters while table 4 gives the renormalization factors , @xmath71 values , @xmath59/n for the folding model analysis .",
    "the relationship between the reduced electric quadrupole transition rate @xmath75 for the ground state to the @xmath76 state in units of @xmath77 and the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath71 is given by @xcite    @xmath78    where @xmath79 fm and @xmath80 is the atomic number .",
    "the quadrupole deformations listed in reference  @xcite were obtained by using eqn .",
    "10 but keeping only the terms up to first order in @xmath71 .",
    "we have recalculated these values by keeping terms up to third order in @xmath71 .",
    "the recalculated quadrupole deformations thus obtained from the experimental @xmath75 values listed in reference  @xcite are 0.33078 and 0.59284 for @xmath0o and @xmath0ne respectively .",
    "as can be seen from table 4 , the quadrupole deformation obtained from the present analysis for @xmath0o is in excellent agreement while that for @xmath0ne is significantly underestimated due to lack of experimental data at forward angles .",
    "the inelastic scattering is more sensitive at forward angles due to its relative purity compared to data corresponding to backward angular range where other non - elastic processes also contribute .",
    "the quality of elastic as well as the inelastic fits deteriorate at backward angles and similar deterioration of fits are also seen for proton scattering from other nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is probably that the full cross section is ascribed to potential scattering while quasi - compound - nucleus formation feeds back into the elastic channel and whose energy - dependence is controlled by barrier - top resonances .",
    "the backward angular range classically corresponds to smaller impact parameters .",
    "this fact suggests higher compound nuclear formation probabilities at backward angles while those at forward angles are expected to be negligibly small . since relative contributions of compound elastic and direct elastic are not disentangled , @xmath59 was calculated only upto about 90@xmath81 in center of mass during fitting the @xmath0o data .",
    "it may be noted that since we could not acquire the experimental data for @xmath0o , they have been read quite accurately from the plots in the original paper  @xcite and a 5@xmath82 uniform error has been assumed .",
    "the technique used for extracting the data from plots along with relevant co - ordinate transformations are described in the appendix .",
    "in the present study we find that the parametrized sbm effective interaction , and the realistic ddm3y effective interaction obtained from sophisticated g - matrix calculations provide equivalent descriptions for the elastic and inelastic scattering of protons from the mirror nuclei @xmath0ne and @xmath0o ( fig . 3 , 4 ) .",
    "the values of the deformation parameters have been extracted from the calculations for these nuclei . even though the analysis reported here is quite detailed , measurements at higher energies may still be useful in distinguishing various effective interactions .",
    "the lack of sensitivity is due to the fact that at such energies , nuclear densities primarily probed are near the surface , which makes the density dependent effects less realizable .",
    "the form of density dependence used here is more physical as compared to other forms .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 can be interpreted as ` in medium ' nucleon - nucleon interaction cross section while @xmath31 as the non - interaction probability arising due to higher order exchange and pauli blocking effects .    in summary , a consistent folding model analysis of proton scattering on a = 18 nuclei",
    "is carried out using two different effective nn interactions .",
    "the conventional way of generating the form factors is followed , that is , by taking the derivatives of the potentials ( microscopic real and imaginary as well as phenomenological surface imaginary and spin - orbit potentials ) .",
    "deformation parameters ( @xmath71 ) are extracted from the analyses .",
    "the results obtained for the deformation parameter are in good agreement with the available results .",
    "the density dependence parameter obtained from nuclear matter calculations , which has been used in the single folding model description for the analysis of elastic and inelastic scattering of protons , also provides excellent estimate for nuclear mean free path .",
    "we know that the ddm3y effective interaction , has profound theoretical basis .",
    "it provides unified description of cluster radioactivity , scatterings of @xmath21 and heavy ion when used in a double folding model , and nuclear matter when used in a single folding model .",
    "we find that it also provides reasonable description for elastic and inelastic scattering of protons .",
