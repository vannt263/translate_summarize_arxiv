    "consider a family @xmath7 of positive homothetic copies of a fixed convex body @xmath4 with homothety coefficients @xmath5 .",
    "following hadwiger  @xcite , we call @xmath7 _ non - separable _ if any hyperplane @xmath8 intersecting @xmath9 intersects a member of @xmath7 . answering a question by erds , a.  w.  goodman and r.  e.  goodman  @xcite proved the following assertion :    [ thm : goodman ] given a non - separable family @xmath7 of euclidean balls of radii @xmath10 in @xmath11 , it is always possible to cover them by a ball of radius @xmath3",
    ".    let us outline here the idea of their proof since we are going to reuse it in different settings .",
    "first , a.  w.  goodman and r.  e.  goodman prove the following lemma , resembling the @xmath12-dimensional case of the general theorem :    [ lem : segm ] let @xmath13 be segments of lengths @xmath14 with midpoints @xmath15 . assume the union @xmath16 is a segment ( i.e. the family of segments is non - separable )",
    ". then the segment @xmath17 of length @xmath18 with midpoint at the center of mass @xmath19 covers @xmath16 .",
    "next , for a family @xmath20 ( @xmath21 denotes the unit ball centered at the origin of @xmath11 ) , a.  w.  goodman and r.  e.  goodman consider the point @xmath22 ( i.e. , the center of mass of  @xmath7 if the weights of the balls are chosen to be proportional to the radii ) .",
    "they project the whole family onto @xmath23 orthogonal directions ( chosen arbitrarily ) and apply lemma  [ lem : segm ] to show that the ball of radius @xmath3 centered at @xmath24 indeed covers @xmath7 .    in  @xcite , k.  bezdek and z.  lngi",
    "show that theorem  [ thm : goodman ] actually holds not only for balls but also for any centrally - symmetric bodies :    [ thm : symm ] given a non - separable family of homothets of centrally - symmetric convex body @xmath4 with homothety coefficients @xmath5 it is always possible to cover them by a translate of @xmath25 .    the idea of their proof is to use lemma  [ lem : segm ] to deduce the statement for the case when @xmath26 is a hypercube , and then deduce the result for sections of the hypercube ( which can approximate arbitrary centrally - symmetric bodies ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that theorem  [ thm : symm ] follows from lemma  [ lem : segm ] by a more direct argument ( however , missed by a.  w.  goodman and r.  e.  goodman ) . in 2001 f.  petrov proposed a particular case of the problem ( when @xmath26 is a euclidean ball ) to open mathematical contest of saint petersburg lyceum  239 @xcite .",
    "he assumed the following solution ( working for any symmetric @xmath26 as well ) : for a family @xmath27 , consider a homothet @xmath28 with center @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath28 does not cover  @xmath7 , then there exists a hyperplane @xmath8 separating a point @xmath30 from @xmath31 .",
    "projection onto the direction orthogonal to @xmath8 reveals a contradiction with lemma  [ lem : segm ] .",
    "another interesting approach to goodmans theorem was introduced by k.  bezdek and a.  litvak  @xcite .",
    "they put the problem in the context of studying the packing analogue of bang s problem through the lp - duality , which gives yet another proof of goodmans theorem for the case when @xmath26 is a euclidean disk in the plane .",
    "one can adapt their argument for the original bang s problem to get a `` dual '' counterpart of goodmans theorem .",
    "we discuss this counterpart and give our proof of a slightly more general statement in section  [ sect : anti ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section  [",
    "sect : nonsymm ] we prove a strengthening ( with factor @xmath32 instead of @xmath23 ) of the following result of k.  bezdek and z.  langi :    [ thm : nonsymmweak ] given a non - separable family of positive homothetic copies of a ( not necessarily centrally - symmetric ) convex body @xmath4 with homothety coefficients @xmath5 , it is always possible to cover them by a translate of @xmath33 .",
    "in section  [ sect : simplex ] we show that if we weaken the condition of non - separability considering only @xmath34 directions of separating hyperplanes , then factor @xmath32 can not be improved .",
    "in section  [ sect : anti ] we prove a counterpart of goodmans theorem related to the notion somehow opposite to non - separability : given a positive integer @xmath35 and a family of euclidean balls of radii @xmath10 in @xmath11 , it is always possible to inscribe a ball of radius @xmath36 within their convex hull , provided every hyperplane intersects at most @xmath35 interiors of the balls .",
    "let @xmath4 be a ( not necessarily centrally - symmetric ) convex body containing the origin and let @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 stands for the standard inner product ) be its polar body .",
