    "the temporal shape of the prompt emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) can show a variety of profiles : from narrow and symmetric to wide and asymmetric pulses . in some cases a less energetic precursor",
    "is also detected , and in other cases a few overlapping pulses can take place for the entire duration of the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "it is true that many of those pulses ( overlapping or single ) detected for long - duration grbs can be described by the superposition of `` fast rise exponential decay '' ( fred ) profiles , one for each pulse .",
    "moreover , several grbs display only a single - shot fred - like emission over the background in the @xmath0-ray passband , that can be easily described by a simple norris exponential model ( norris et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the context of the standard fireball model ( rees @xmath7 mszros 1992 )",
    "one may expect such grbs to exhibit comparably simple behaviour in their afterglows at other wavelengths , and therefore be ideal testbeds for the model . for full temporal and spectral coverage ,",
    "the predicted properties of the multiwavelength light curves have well - predicted shapes , depending on the relative contribution of the different components .    in the x - ray band the temporal decay of many grbs observed by _",
    "swift _ is well described by a canonical `` steep - shallow - steep '' decay ( tagliaferri et al . 2005 ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) , with superposed flares observed in @xmath350% of bursts ( obrien et al . 2006",
    "; chincarini et al . 2007 ; falcone et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the initial steep decay is interpreted as the result of the high - latitude emission or as the contribution of the reverse - shock emission ( e.g. , panaitescu & kumar ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) , the shallow phase is consistent with long - lasting central energy activity ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the late steep decay is evidence of decaying forward - shock emission , ( i.e. , the standard x - ray afterglow phase ) .    in the optical band , observed light curves are expected to show a variety of shapes depending on the relative contribution of the forward- and reverse - shock emission ( kobayashi @xmath7 zhang 2003 ; zhang , kobayashi @xmath7 mszros 2003 ) and the starting time of the observations . in particular ,",
    "if the optical observations start when the reverse - shock contribution still dominates or when the central engine is still active , the detected temporal decay deviates from a simple power law ( see fig . 1 in melandri et al .",
    "melandri et al .",
    "( 2008 ) investigated the behaviour of the early decay phase in the optical and x - ray bands for 24 grbs and classified them into four self - consistent groups based on the relative shapes observed in the two bands .",
    "although 14 of the grbs were well described by the standard model , the remaining 10 required adaptations such as ambient density gradients or energy injections from long - lived central engines . in some cases ,",
    "even these modifications were unable to fully explain the light - curve properties .",
    "grb 070419a was particularly problematic , despite a simple fred @xmath0-ray profile . in this paper",
    "we present a comprehensive multiwavelength temporal and spectral study of grb 070419a , including published and unpublished data from infrared to @xmath0-ray bands , and use this extensive dataset to challenge the standard model .    throughout",
    "we use the following conventions : the power - law flux density is given as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the temporal decay index and @xmath10 is the spectral slope ; we assume a standard cosmology with @xmath11  km  s@xmath12  mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ; and all uncertainties are quoted at the @xmath15 confidence level ( cl ) , unless stated otherwise .",
    "on 2007 april 19 at 09:59:26 ut the burst alert telescope ( bat ; barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ) triggered on grb 070419a ( stamatikos et al .",
    "2007a ) , a dim long grb with a duration of @xmath16  s. the @xmath0-ray emission observed by bat is a single - shot fred light curve , with a total duration of a few hundred seconds .",
    "this event displayed an average @xmath0-ray fluence ( @xmath3 5 @xmath5 10@xmath17 erg @xmath18 ) and a peak photon flux lying at the low end of the distribution of _ swift _ grbs ( sakamoto et al .",
    "the redshift of the burst ( @xmath19 , cenko et al .",
    "2007 ) resulted in an isotropic energy estimate of @xmath20  ergs in the 15150 kev observed bandpass ( stamatikos et al .",
    "2007c ) .",
    "follow - up observations of the bat error circle were performed with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; burrows et al .",
    "2005 ) starting about 113  s after the bat trigger .",
    "a bright , uncatalogued , fading source was detected at @xmath9(j2000 ) = 12@xmath2110@xmath2258.80@xmath23 , @xmath24(j2000 ) = + 39@xmath2555@xmath2632.4@xmath27 ( perri et al .",

    "the afterglow of grb 070419a was followed in the optical band from about 3 min and continued up to @xmath318 hr after the burst event .",
    "late - time observations were acquired with the 8.4-m large binocular telescope ( lbt ) in the sdss-@xmath32 filter and showed a bump in the light curve ( dai et al .",
    "2007 ) , compatible with a supernova bump ( see section 4.3 for a more detailed discussion of the possible supernova contribution ) .",

    ".log of the optical observations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     * due to the sparse coverage in the x - ray band after @xmath33  s , the extrapolation of the x - ray flux at @xmath34  s has been done taking into account the two possible fits for the late - time behaviour as described in section 3.2.1 .",
    "the sed , showed in fig .",
    "[ figsed1 ] , is well fitted by a simple optically absorbed power law .",
    "the absorption in the x - ray band has been fixed to a negligible value because it can not be determined by the fit with a single x - ray point .",
    "the assumed extinction profile is the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) profile ( pei 1992 ) .",
    "the best - fitting values in the rest frame of the grb ( @xmath19 ) are @xmath35 and @xmath36 mag .",
    "from the analysis of the high - energy data of grb 070419a it seems clear that the emission can be simply explained by a central engine still active up to at least 250  s , very likely up to 10@xmath28  s ( see fig .",
    "[ figxrt2 ] ) . after that time",
    ", the forward - shock emission takes over and the x - ray light curve can be explained by a simple power - law decay ( or a slightly complex two - component model ) .",
    "clearly the optical light curve ( fig .",
    "[ figopt1 ] ) is too complex to be explained with the standard forward shock ( fs ) model . in general",
    ", optical brightening could be due to the enhancement in the ambient density . since the luminosity above the cooling frequency is insensitive to the the ambient density , if the x - ray band is located above the cooling frequency , the lack of a corresponding peak in the x - ray light curve would be naturally explained .",
    "however , the features in the optical light curve are too sharp to be explained by the density enhancement model ( nakar & granot 2007 ) .",
    "another mechanism should be responsible for the production of the observed optical features .",
    "a possible mechanism is reverse shock ( rs ) emission which dominates in the optical band at early times .",
    "although the decay behaviour of @xmath37 is well known for the rs emission , the initial decay could be as shallow as @xmath38 if the typical frequency is above the optical band ( @xmath39 ) at the rs crossing time ( sari & piran 1999 ; kobayashi 2000 ) .",
    "since the observed index ( @xmath40 ) is consistent with the expected value , we test this possibility in detail .    assuming that the optical peak ( @xmath41  s ) gives the fireball deceleration time",
    ", we can estimate the initial lorentz factor of the fireball as @xmath42 .",
    "if the break in the optical light curve around 1500  s is due to the passage of the typical frequency of the rs , @xmath43 , through the optical band ( kobayashi 2000 ) , @xmath44 should be around @xmath45 hz at @xmath46 .",
    "the typical frequency of the fs , @xmath47 , should be about @xmath48 hz at the peak time ( e.g. , kobayashi & zhang 2003 ) .",
    "we expect that the fs emission in the optical band should increase as @xmath49 in the ism ( or @xmath50 in the wind ambient ) until @xmath51  s when @xmath52 passes through the optical band .",
    "since the observed optical luminosity already decreases as @xmath53 or steeper around 10@xmath54  s , this is not consistent .",
    "if the fireball is magnetized , the @xmath55 could be smaller by a factor of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the ratio of the microscopic parameters in the two shock regions ( we use the same notation as gomboc et al .",
    "2008 ; @xmath57 = @xmath58 ) .",
    "the passage time of @xmath55 through the optical band scales as @xmath59 . in order to get a fs peak time two orders of magnitude smaller",
    ", a very large @xmath60 is needed . with this value of @xmath57 ,",
    "the luminosity ratio between the rs and fs peaks is about @xmath61 . in the observational data ,",
    "the rs component is only a few times brighter than the fs component .",
    "the introduction of magnetization can not fix the problem with the fs peak .",
    "if we stick with the rs model , the typical frequency of the rs emission ( @xmath44 ) should be well below the optical band at the shock crossing time .",
    "the initial shallow decay ( @xmath38 ) in the optical might be explained with energy injection to the fireball ejecta ( refreshed shocks ) .",
    "we can not rule out this possibility , but the energy injection rate should be tuned very carefully in order to reproduce the observed power - law decay , and moreover we would need to assume a sharp cessation of the injection to get the clear break .    the shallow decay phase observed between 450 and 1500 s , still described by a power - law , and the very sharp transitions from one power - law to another in the optical light curve are puzzling features for any model .",
    "one possible explanation of the observed features in the optical light curve is the assumption of a finely tuned long - lived central engine .",
    "this condition is indeed necessary to explain the plateau phase observed in the canonical x - ray light curves of many grbs .",
    "as discussed above , the optical light curve continues to decay to late times with an unusually shallow gradient .",
    "late - time observations consist of lbt detections in the sdss-@xmath32 filter , the first ( @xmath62  s ) and third ( @xmath63  s ) of which are consistent with the shallow decay of the afterglow emission . at @xmath64 , a small excess above the underlying power law is observed ( see fig . [ figopt1 ] ) .",
    "this feature has been attributed to a possible supernova component ( dai et al .",
    "2008 ) , but interpretation of the late - time data are critically dependent on the model of the underlying afterglow . given the faintness of the emission at these late times ( @xmath65 mag ) , which is not atypical for grb host - galaxy magnitudes at this redshift ( wainwright et al .",
    "2007 ; ovaldsen et al . 2007 )",
    ", future deep optical imaging of the grb location would confirm whether a host - galaxy contribution is present or the light has continued to decline below detection limits .",
    "* the @xmath0-ray profile of grb 070419a consists of a single shot ( fred ) a few hundred seconds long .",
    "the @xmath0-ray fluence ( @xmath66 erg @xmath18 ) has an average value for the _ swift _ grb population , but the peak photon flux puts this event at the low end of that distribution among _ swift _ grbs ( sakamoto et al . 2008 ) . * the xrt 0.310 kev data show the presence of some intrinsic ( rest - frame ) absorption , and there is weak evidence for an evolution of both @xmath67 and the photon index ( mean value of @xmath68 ) with time . * the xrt - bat fluxes , derived in the 15150 kev band after removing the absorption in xrt curves , shows that the initial steep x - ray decay is just the decay of the fred , modelled with a norris profile ( norris et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the early bat - xrt light curve is due to internal shocks or other processes related to prolonged central engine activity up to at least 250  s. * after 400500  s , the late - time x - ray power law begins to emerge , with index @xmath69 ( or @xmath70 in the case of the more complex fit model with two power laws ) .",
    "this behaviour seems to be supported by the optical light curve that shows a peak roughly at the same time ( @xmath71  s ) .",
    "* we tried to explain the behaviour of the optical light curve in the context of the standard fireball model .",
    "however the simple and natural explanation ( fs plus rs components ) does not work .",
    "the magnetization of the ejecta could affect the fs peak time significantly , but the effect is negligible and not in agreement with the observations .",
    "another possibility to explain the optical behaviour is to argue for the existence of a significant density enhancement in the ambient medium .",
    "the luminosity below the cooling frequency is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "if a blast wave hits a density enhancement of several tens or hundreds , the bump in the optical at @xmath3450  s could be explained .",
    "however , the observed peak feature might be too sharp for this model .",
    "* we can not rule out the possibility of a finely tuned central engine for grb 070419a .",
    "however , the optical light curve would not be easily reproduced without assuming a particular energy injection rate and a sudden cessation of the injection in order to create the observed optical features . * from our detailed multiwavelength analysis we can conclude that grb 070419a is not explained in the context of the simple standard fireball model . assuming energy injection or a tail component following the fireball , or even a more complex emission picture , the rs model might explain the observations , but this scenario would result in a rather _ ad hoc _ explanation only for this particular event .",
