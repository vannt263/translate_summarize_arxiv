    "it was first pointed out by ginzburg , _ et al_@xcite that an @xmath4 collider could be adapted to make an @xmath5 collider by back - scattering laser light off the high energy electron beam .",
    "the resulting @xmath5 collider would be expected to have a center of mass energy and luminosity comparable to that of the @xmath4 collider , and this would open up new avenues @xcite in testing the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics and in discovering physics beyond the standard model .",
    "experimental signatures of supersymmetry @xcite at high energy @xmath5 colliders have been investigated to some extent @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath6-parity conservation , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a stable neutral particle and will escape detection .",
    "the studies to date have focused on the simplest case of lightest neutralino ( @xmath7 ) production under the assumption that @xmath7 is the lsp and is gaugino - like .",
    "the process is @xmath8 with subsequent decay of the selectron @xmath9 , and the experimental signature is @xmath10 .",
    "a well - known feature of this process is that it has a lower threshold for selectron production than the analogous @xmath4 process .    in this letter",
    "we extend the previous supersymmetric ( susy ) studies with @xmath5 colliders in two respects .",
    "firstly , we will consider two scenarios , allowing the lsp to be either the lightest neutralino @xmath7 or the gravitino .",
    "the `` neutralino lsp '' scenario is often assumed to be realized in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , whereas in models of low energy dynamical supersymmetry breaking @xcite the lsp is the gravitino and the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) may be the lightest neutralino or a right - handed slepton , whose decay proceeds through its coupling to the goldstino component of the gravitino @xcite .",
    "some of the phenomenology of a light gravitino has recently been discussed in the context of @xmath4 and hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "secondly , we will generalize the previous analysis @xcite in the mssm ( without assuming high scale unification of masses or couplings ) by allowing for more production channels and decay modes of the @xmath11 .",
    "we find that a complete determination of those mssm parameters that enter the neutralino and chargino mass matrices , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ( as well as the selectron mass ) , may be possible for certain ranges of these parameters by simply measuring the outgoing electron energy spectrum .",
    "it is well known that the cross section for @xmath12 approaches a constant at asymptotic energies @xcite ; hence it is crucial to reduce the @xmath13 background as much as possible .",
    "this can be achieved in two ways .",
    "the obvious one is to use highly - polarized right - handed electron beams . at high energies",
    "the electrons from the @xmath13 decay are peaked in the backward direction inside the cone @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the center of mass energy ) , so that the @xmath13 effects can also be significantly cut off by imposing angular cuts in the backward direction of the outgoing electron .",
    "it is also expected that the photon beam obtained by back - scattering laser light off the electron beam will not be monochromatic in practice . to simplify our analysis and focus on physics issues",
    ", we only consider the case with right - handed polarized electrons and monochromatic high energy photon beams .",
    "another advantage of using @xmath16 beams lies in the fact that the coupling of a right - handed electron / selectron to a chargino is suppressed by the electron mass , and this greatly simplifies the analysis .",
    "furthermore , in @xmath17 collisions the sm backgrounds to the susy signatures most frequently involve a neutrino pair from @xmath18 decay carrying away the missing energy , and this can be efficiently eliminated by cuts on the invariant mass of the missing energy around @xmath19 .",
    "contamination from @xmath20 is expected in actual experiments and can be easily incorporated .",
    "similarly , the folding in of the photon spectrum can be done once its actual shape is known .",
    "within the minimal supersymmetric standard model , the lightest neutralino state @xmath7 is often assumed to be the lsp .",
    "the mass of @xmath7 is generally expected to be at least tens of gev @xcite .",
    "we refer to the mssm as the model with minimal particle content , with @xmath6-parity conservation , and without assuming gauge coupling , gaugino mass , or scalar mass unification at high energy scales @xcite .",
    "in general , the states of the neutralino weak interaction basis mix among themselves and can be transformed into mass eigenstates ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) by a unitary matrix @xmath23 which is defined by the following relation among two - component spinors _ i = n^_ij _ j^ [ eq : n ] , where @xmath24 contains the four states in the weak interaction basis with @xmath25 referring to the photino ( @xmath26 ) , zino ( @xmath27 ) and two orthogonal linear combinations of the two higgsinos , respectively @xcite .",
    "both the masses of the neutralinos and the matrix @xmath23 are functions of the higgs mixing parameter @xmath0 , the ratio of the two higgs vevs @xmath28 , and the @xmath29 and @xmath30 gaugino masses @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we start by considering the simplest case @xcite where @xmath31 assuming that @xmath7 is gaugino - like .",
    "the experimental signature in this case is @xmath32 . throughout this letter",
    "we will use the narrow width approximation which is justified because the sparticles decay weakly . in this approximation the differential cross sections can be easily obtained . as the @xmath33 decay is isotropic in its rest frame , boosting back to the lab frame ( i.e. the @xmath5 cm frame ) gives a flat distribution in the electron energy spectrum and @xmath34 @xcite . ] .",
    "the standard model background @xmath35 with @xmath36",
    "has an electron energy distribution with a breit - wigner shape , and can be eliminated by cuts on the outgoing electron energy .    the endpoints ( @xmath37 ) in the electron energy spectrum can be obtained from kinematical considerations .",

    "the cross section on the right hand side is obtained in the limit when the photino is the lsp .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the electron energy spectrum ( and the total cross section ) can determine @xmath39 , @xmath34 and @xmath40 .",
    "since @xmath34 and @xmath41 are functions of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 only , nontrivial constraints on these four parameters can be obtained .",

    "the experimental signatures are in general more involved , and no further information about the mssm can be gained beyond @xmath39 , @xmath0 , @xmath28 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "models of low energy gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking @xcite have quite a different mass spectrum from the mssm . in particular , it is very likely that this susy breaking scheme would lead to the gravitino being the lsp with the nlsp being either the lightest neutralino or a right - handed slepton , which we will assume to be @xmath33 .",
    "the gravitino gets its mass via the super higgs mechanism ( assuming zero cosmological constant ) with @xmath77 , where @xmath78 denotes the scale of supersymmetry breaking and @xmath79 . in models of low energy dynamical supersymmetry breaking ( dsb ) , @xmath80 ranges from @xmath81 to a few thousand tev , and the gravitino mass takes its values in the ev to kev range .",
    "it is well known @xcite that a light gravitino can couple to matter with weak interaction strength instead of gravitationally via its goldstino component .",
    "the goldstino has couplings to a particle and its superpartner determined by the supersymmetric analog of the goldberg - treiman relation , and is proportional to @xmath82 , where @xmath83 measures the mass splitting between an ordinary particle and its superpartner .",

    "if @xmath86 , the decay @xmath87 can proceed through the zino component of @xmath7 ; for most of the parameter space , the photonic decay will be the dominant mode , with its width given by @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is defined in eq .",
