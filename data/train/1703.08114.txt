    "in this section , we discuss the performance of the frequency - domain mzi expected in the case where the input comes from a typical single photon source .",
    "we first measured background photon count rates by replacing the power meters with superconducting single - photon detectors  ( sspds)@xcite . the quantum efficiencies are 0.3 and 0.6 for the 795-nm and 1580-nm light , respectively . for measuring the background photon count rate @xmath103 at 795 nm induced by ppln1 ,",

    "[ fig : noise ] .",
    "the result shows nonlinear and linear dependencies for 795-nm and 1580-nm light , which is the same tendency reported in ref .",
    "it means the background photons are mainly originated from raman scattering of the strong pump light .    by using the observed background photon count rates , we estimate the expected interference visibility when we use typical single photon source and filters .",
    "we assume that the spectral bandwidth of the input light is a transform - limited pulse of a gaussian with its fwhm bandwidth of @xmath106 and the measurement time window is set to @xmath107 which corresponds to the twice of fwhm pulse length of the input light , which leads to 98% collection efficiency .",

    "it is reasonable to assume the numbers of the background photons are proportional to the measurement time window and the bandwidth . under this assumption ,",
    "the numbers of the background photons in the measurement time window are derived as functions of @xmath43 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , as follows ; @xmath118 by using the experimental parameters including the conversion efficiencies , the transmittances of the optical circuit and the quantum efficiencies of sspds , the expected visibilities with the average photon number @xmath119 of the input pulse are represented by @xmath120 the estimated visibilities at @xmath58  mw with @xmath121 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vis ] by using @xmath122 .",
    "we see that the bandpass filters with the bandwidth of @xmath123 is sufficient for achieving high visibilities over 0.9 when the input light has the average photon number above 0.1 . for example , in the case of a single photon with a bandwidth of 9.6  mhz borrowed from ref .",
    "@xcite , a visibility of @xmath124 will be obtained by using filters with a bandwidth of @xmath125  mhz . if we use a single photon with a bandwidth of 1.2  ghz reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the high visibility will be obtained by using filters with a bandwidth of @xmath126  ghz .",
    "such frequency filters are achieved by commonly - used etalons , cavities and fiber bragg gratings .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated the first - order interference between 1580-nm and 795-nm light by constructing the frequency - domain mzi composed of two partial frequency converters using ppln waveguide and the pump light at 1600  nm as the frequency - domain bss .",
