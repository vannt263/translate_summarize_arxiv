    "recent observational evidence has shown that many galactic globular clusters , including 47 tucanae ( ngc 104 ) , contain more than one chemically distinct stellar population ( e.g. , see recent review by gratton et al .",

    "nataf et al .",
    "( 2011 ) also find changes in the rgb - bump and horizontal branch morphologies as a function of cluster radius to be evidence supporting he - enhancement in some 47 tuc stars near the core .",
    "more recently , milone et al . (",
    "2012 ) extended these studies to follow the two major populations in 47 tuc from the main sequence through the horizontal branch , and identified a third population comprising only 8% of the cluster s stars and discerned only on the subgiant branch .",
    "the primordial population contributes only 20% of the stars in the cluster center , but is more extended , and contributes 30% of the cluster s stars overall .",
    "in addition , richer et al .",
    "( 2013 ) reported that stars on the blue side of the main sequence are more centrally concentrated and show anisotropic proper motions compared to stars on the red side of the main sequence .",
    "overall , the evidence for multiple populations in 47 tuc is compelling and suggests that both chemical and kinematic differences separate the populations .",
    "studies of the light elements ( cno , na ) in 47 tuc mirror the photometric analyses of the cluster s multiple populations .",
    "worley & cottrell ( 2012 ) , following earlier analyses by norris & freeman ( 1979 ) and paltoglou & freeman ( 1984 ) , confirmed the anti - correlation of sodium and cn , as well as the bi - modal distribution of cn strength , from medium resolution spectra of giants .",
    "carretta et al .",
    "( 2009b ) determined oxygen and sodium abundances for 115 giants in 47 tuc , finding that 2/3 of the stars belong to an intermediate ( o - poor and na - rich ) population , consistent with current cluster formation models , with most of the remaining stars belonging to an earlier ( primordial ) generation .",
    "dorazi , et al .",
    "( 2010 ) examined several dozen turnoff stars in 47 tuc , confirming the anti - correlation of oxygen and sodium in unevolved stars and finding a similar distribution in [ na / o ] as in the giants .",
    "their observations rule out in - situ mixing in the giants as the primary source of the o - na anticorrelation .",
    "neutron - capture elements , however , show only modest enhancements and no star - to - star variations ( james et al .",
    "2004 , worley et al .",
    "2010 ) , suggesting that core - collapse supernovae and low - mass agb stars also do not cause the light element abundance anomalies .",
    "according to vesperini et al .",
    "( 2013 ) n - body simulations indicate that the multiple populations in a gc do not mix completely until the cluster has lost a large fraction of its mass through two - body interactions , which takes several relaxation times .",
    "for instance , the authors found that the populations in a gc are well mixed when the cluster s age is @xmath3 times its half - mass relaxation time - scale @xmath4 ; for 47 tuc the ratio of the cluster age ( 9.9 gyr , see hansen et al .",
    "2013 ) to its half - mass relaxation time ( 3.5 gyr , harris 1996 , 2010 edition ) is @xmath5 , thus the multiple populations in 47 tuc are expected to differ not only on their chemical composition , but also on their radial distribution and proper motions .    in this work we present the analysis of the spectra of 164 red giants in the globular cluster 47 tuc , including abundances for oxygen , sodium , and aluminum , among other elements , to explore star - to - star variations in the light element abundances and characterize the multiple populations .",

    "furthermore , the two - tailed probability ( p - value ) obtained to gauge the statistical significance of the linear fit is @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for [ si i / fe ] and [ la ii / fe ] respectively . the null hypothesis that there is no linear trend of these abundance ratios with t@xmath59",
    "is rejected since the p - values obtained are smaller than 0.05 .",
    "the larger observational scatter in the [ la ii / fe ] ratio detected at higher temperatures is a result of the lower s / n of these fainter stars .",
    "additionally , another consequence related to the lower s / n is that stars with intrinsically weak la lines are less likely to be included in the analysis making the slope of the [ la ii / fe]-t@xmath59 relation appear steeper . interestingly",
    ", there is a hint of a [ la ii / fe ] correlation with t@xmath59 for m3 and m13 in the results presented by sneden et al ( 2004 ) in their fig .",
    "the origin of the si - t@xmath59 trend is unknown and the high - excitation potential lines used for the analysis might not be reliable tracers of the actual si abundance .",
    "the resolution of this long - standing problem in the abundance of si is beyond of the scope of this project .",
    "few chemical studies of 47 tuc have been performed using samples of @xmath2100 or more stars .",
    "for instance , carretta et al .",
    "( 2009a ) showed that the na - o anticorrelation is a shared characteristic of all gcs , including 47 tuc , and identified three subpopulations of primordial ( p ) , intermediate ( i ) , and extreme ( e ) stars .",
    "the spreads in o and na are not caused by in situ nucleosynthesis , since a na - o anti - correlation is also found in low - mass turn - off and early subgiants stars in 47 tuc ( carretta et al .",
    "2004 ) , which do not have convective envelopes reaching temperatures high enough to deplete o and enhance na . to classify 47 tuc giants into the primordial , intermediate , and extreme populations identified by carretta et al .",
    "( 2009b ) , we adopted the criteria used by those authors .",
    "the primordial population is defined as those stars with na abundances comparable to field stars at similar metallicity ; at the metallicity of 47 tuc , this corresponds [ na / fe]@xmath620.4 dex .",
    "stars with [ na / fe]@xmath630.4 dex constitute the second generation . additionally , carretta et al .",
    "defined an extended second generation found in some massive gcs ; this `` extreme '' second generation was defined as stars with high na and [ o / na]@xmath640.90 dex . after removing the nlte correction used by carretta et al .",
    "we adopted [ na / fe]=+0.3 dex to separate the primordial ( first ) and intermediate ( second ) generations , and [ o / na]=0.85 dex to split the second generation into an intermediate and an extreme population .",
    "our samples included several giants with lower [ o / fe ] ratios than were found in carretta et al.s ( 2009b ) sample .",
    "thus , our na - o anti - correlation data , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nao ] , extends in [ o / fe ] down to 0.5 dex , indicating the presence of all three populations defined by carretta et al .",
    "( 2009b ) .",
    "a histogram of the [ na / o ] abundance ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig_histo ] ) shows two peaks with an extended tail toward high na abundance supporting the presence of three populations .",
    "47 tuc is one of the few gcs in addition to omega cen , m13 , ngc 2808 and ngc 6752 , that presents more than two populations .",
    "according to the models of ventura and dantona ( 2008 ) , an oxygen depletion of only @xmath65 dex is expected in metal - rich agb stars ( z=0.004 ) as a consequence of hot bottom burning , which makes challenging to explain the existence of third generation stars in 47 tuc with [ o / fe]@xmath20.5 .",
    "interestingly , ventura and dantona ( 2007 ) found that he - enhanced , metal - poor ( [ fe / h]=-1.5 ) stars formed with [ o / fe]=0.2 can become extreme o - poor stars ( [ o / fe]@xmath110.4 dex ) if deep mixing takes place . for instance , several authors ( e.g. , kraft 1992 , 1997 ; pilachowski et al . 1996 ; cavallo & nagar 2000 ; sneden et al .",
    "2004 ; cohen & melndez 2005 ; johnson et al .",
    "2005 ; johnson & pilachowski 2012 ) found extreme o - poor stars in the metal - poor gc m13 and suggested that this can be explained by deep mixing .",
    "these authors found that the extreme o - depleted stars are found only above the rgb bump and their [ o / fe ] ratio decreases with increasing luminosity , consistent with the deep mixing scenario .",
    "in our sample , 11 stars were found to belong to the extreme population . even though all the stars in our sample are above the rgb bump , we do not find a strong trend of [ o / fe ] versus @xmath34 .",
    "this could be a result of undersampling the cooler / more luminous stars .",
    "while extreme population , o - depleted stars are absent in the carretta et al .",
    "( 2004 ) sample of to and sgb stars on 47 tuc , nevertheless , their absence might be a consequence of a small sample statistics .",
    "unfortunately , simulation of deep mixing at the metallicity of 47 tuc are unavailable to help interpret our measurements .",
    "nonetheless , oxygen depletion by deep mixing in 47 tuc is expected to be mild for high metallicity clusters ( charbonnel et al . 1998 ) .",
    "fluorine abundances have been determined in a few gcs , such as omega cen , m4 , ngc 6712 , m22 , and 47 tuc ( cunha et al .",

    "the cumulative radial distributions of the stellar populations in our hydra and flames samples , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cum]a , suggest that the intermediate population ( green curve ) is more centrally concentrated than the primordial population ( blue curve ) .",
    "this result is consistent with theoretical models for gc formation ( dercole et al .",
    "2008 ) that predict that a cooling flow of low - velocity gas from agb stars accumulates gas in the innermost regions of the cluster where a second generation of stars forms .",
    "furthermore , vandenberg et al . (",
    "2013 ) indicated that 47 tuc is one of the massive and concentrated galactic gcs that does not develop steady - state winds and therefore can retain the gas expelled by its stars .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) statistical test was used to assess whether the cumulative radial distributions of the different generations are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "a p - value=0.02 allows to reject our null hypothesis .",
    "this result is in contradiction to that of carretta et al .",
    "( 2009b ) , who did not find a statistically significant difference in the cumulative distributions of primordial and intermediate generations .",
    "the combination of the hydra and flames data together provides larger samples in both the outer regions of the cluster ( benefiting from the wide field of view of hydra ) an the inner regions of the cluster ( benefiting from the closer spatial sampling of flames ) .",
    "our result is in agreement , however , with the photometric approach for tracing multiple populations ( milone et al .",

    "[ fig_cum]b , with a p - value=@xmath66 . even though the combined sample of 191 stars with both na and o measurements is smaller than the large sample used by milone et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , the spectroscopic data clearly demonstrate that the second generation is more centrally concentrated than the first generation .",
    "the fraction of first - to - second generation stars n(i+e)/np can be used to estimate the mass of the progenitor structure ( valcarce & catelan , 2011 ) or to constrain the long - term dynamical evolution of the cluster ( vesperini et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "vesperini et al .",
    "found that at any given time in the history of a cluster , the global fraction n(i+e)/np matches that measured locally at a distance from the center of the cluster between one and two half - mass radii ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "for our combined sample , the global value for n(i+e)/np ( 3.4 ) matches the local value at @xmath68 , in agreement with predictions from vesperini et al.s n - body simulations .",
    "additionally , the global fraction of second generation stars is expected to increase over time , since more spatially extended first generation stars are more likely to be lost from the cluster ( dercole et al .",
    "2008 and vesperini et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "we compare the fraction of second generation stars as a function of distance from cluster center in units of the half mass radius in fig .",
    "[ fig_popratio ] , which also includes measurements of the fraction of second generation stars from the milone et al . sample .",
    "the global value of n(i+e)/(n(i+e+p)=0.68 is equal to the local value at a radius of @xmath68 . within the uncertainties of both studies ,",
    "the fraction of second generation stars traces a similar profile .",
    "vesperini et al .",
    "( 2013 ) also determined that multiple populations in gcs become well mixed after more than 60% of the initial cluster mass is lost through two - body interactions ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) . furthermore , giersz & heggie ( 2011 ) estimated using monte carlo simulations that 47 tuc has lost only @xmath69% of its initial mass .",
    "thus , we would expect second generation stars still to be centrally concentrated , consistent with the observed central concentration of o - poor / na - rich stars .",
    "aluminum is the most massive light element that shows significant star - to - star variations in typical gcs and its production in significant quantities requires temperatures @xmath70 mk ( e.g. langer et al .",
    "1997 ; prantzos et al 2007 ) .",
    "since the convective envelopes of metal - rich low - mass giants do not reach these high temperatures ( lager et al . 1997 , denissenkov & weiss 1996 , and references therein ) , aluminum can be used to constrain the nature of the polluters responsible for the light element abundance variations seen in gcs .",
    "several studies have included analyses of the abundance of aluminum in 47 tuc , with most authors noting a modest enhancement of typically [ al / fe ] @xmath71 dex but little scatter ( brown & wallerstein 1992 , norris & da costa 1995 , carretta et al .",
    "2004 , alves - brito et al .",
    "2005 , koch & mcwilliam 2008 , and carretta et al .",
    "each of these studies included only a dozen or fewer stars , and a larger sample of aluminum abundance determinations is needed to understand the variation observed and any intrinsic spread .",
    "more recently , carretta et al .",
    "( 2013 ) found an average",
    "[ al / fe ] = + 0.53 @xmath0 0.01 for a sample of 116 stars , and a range of @xmath2 0.5 dex .",
    "moreover , oconnell et al . (",
    "2011 ) noted that star - to - star variations in the [ al / fe ] ratio within a cluster depends on metallicity . for clusters more metal poor than [ fe / h ] @xmath11 1.2",

    "2005 , sneden et al .",
    "2004 , and cohen & melndez 2005 ) , while for more metal - rich clusters , the dispersion from star to star in the [ al / fe ] ratio is smaller than @xmath73 dex ( m107 in oconnell et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "our measured [ al / fe ] ratios are presented in a box plot in fig .",
    "[ fig_boxplot ] .",
    "the median abundance ratio is represented by a central horizontal line , the first and third quartiles correspond to the bottom and top box boundaries , and the full range of abundance ratios is specified by a vertical line .",
    "comparing our results for the light elements o , na , and al , we first notice that the interquartile range of values is @xmath2 two times smaller for al than for na .",
    "this result is consistent with the simulations of ventura & dantona ( 2008 ) , hereafter vd08 , which indicate that at 47 tuc s metallicity , first generation intermediate mass ( @xmath24 - 8 m@xmath17 ) agb stars are expected to synthesize al in smaller quantities , while producing na in greater quantities compared to more metal - poor agb stars . among other physical parameters , vd08 use the mass loss treatment given by blocker ( 1995 ) , which finds greater mass loss than other published descriptions , resulting in a shorter agb lifetime , i.e. diminishing the number of third dredge up episodes .",
    "additionally , vd08 found that the temperature at the bottom of the convective envelope decreases with metallicity , such that only more massive agb stars will reach the high temperatures required to convert mg into al .",
    "the more massive agb stars also have shorter lifetimes limiting the mg destruction and al production .",
    "thus , both the smaller number of third dredge up episodes due to shorter lifetimes and lower temperatures in the convective envelope of metal - rich agb stars explain the lower aluminum enhancement measured in 47 tuc and other metal - rich gcs .",
    "moreover , vd08 s simulations indicate that the al spread seen in galactic galactic gcs can be fit by the al - yields of agb stars with a variety of masses .",
    "for instance , the al spread in gcs decrease as metallicity increases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_boxplotal ] .",
    "this observational trend is also predicted by vd08 s agb models with masses between 3 - 6 @xmath20 , which tend to converge towards lower al - enhancements at higher metallicities , and differ at most by [ al / fe]@xmath20.4 dex , as can also be seen within the multiple populations in omega cen ( see fig .",
    "22 in johnson & pilachowski 2010 ) .",
    "thus , the metallicity of the polluters plays an important role constraining not only the degree of al enhancement but also the spread of al within a gc .",
    "furthermore , the al yields of vd08 predict a range of values of @xmath74[al / fe]@xmath75 , which is consistent with the average [ al / fe]=0.38 dex we found in our sample .",
    "metal - poor gcs such as m13 show an al - na correlation which was also detected by carretta et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in 47 tuc ( fig .",
    "[ fig_alna]b ) .",
    "however , this correlation is not present in our sample of red giants in 47 tuc ( fig . [ fig_alna]a ) .",
    "since cn lines were not included in their line list we follow this approach and performed synthesis for a sample of 10 stars covering a na range of 0.7 dex .",
    "we found that the al abundances are 0.03 - 0.06 dex higher when the cn lines are removed from the line list .",
    "this offset is too small to account for the lack of al - na correlation in our data .",
    "interestingly , m71 with a metallicity similar to 47 tuc exhibits similar star - to - star variations in light - element abundances , including a na - o anticorrelation , a bimodal cn distribution , and a moderate al enhancement with a small spread @xmath76[al / fe]=@xmath77 .",
    "the al - na correlation in m71 , however , relies on a single star ( ramirez & cohen 2004 ) .",
    "furthermore , rgb stars in omega cen with similar metallicity to 47 tuc giants do not exhibit an al - na correlation ( johnson & pilachowski 2010 ) . to assess whether the lack of an al - na anticorrelation is a common characteristic in metal - rich gcs ,",
    "large samples of stars with measured al and na abundances are needed in other more metal - rich gcs .",
    "the motivation for pursuing this project comes from the discovery that most gcs host multiple populations ( carretta et al . 2009a ) and the properties of their generations can be used to test models of gc formation or models that describe the nature of the polluters .",
    "a direct method to identify the different generations in a gc relies on the chemical content of light - elements .",
    "therefore , we have used abundance ratios of o , na , and al to characterize 47 tuc s multiple populations .",
    "additionally , we have measure abundance ratios for alpha , fe peak , and neutron capture group elements , which can be used to compare 47 tuc with other galactic gcs and halo stars .      \\1 .",
    "chemical abundances for o , na , al , si , ca , ti , fe , ni , la , and eu were determined for 164 stars in 47 tuc using either spectral synthesis or ew analysis .",
    "abundance ratios for the @xmath12 elements , si , ca , and ti , and the n - capture process elements , eu and la , indicate that the composition of the first generation stars is dominated by type ii sne ( [ @xmath12/fe]@xmath100.3 and [ eu / la]=+0.24 ) .",
    "star - to - star variations were detected only for o , na , and al .",
    "we found that the na - o anticorrelation is more extended that previously reported reaching [ o / fe ] ratios as low as @xmath20.5 dex , as found typically in the more massive galactic gcs .",
    "three groups can be identified in the na - o plane indicating that 47 tuc hosts multiple populations , with younger stars being enhanced in na and depleted in o.    \\3 .",
    "for the first time na and o measurements indicate that the intermediate generation is more centrally concentrated than the primordial generation , which is consistent with current hydrodynamical n - body simulations of gc formation .",
    "a ks test indicates that the detected difference in radial distributions is real and not a result of random fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the radial distributions of first and second generation stars found using na and o are consistent with the results obtained from photometric data .",

    "no na - al correlation is found in 47 tuc . to assess whether this is characteristic of more metal - rich gcs ,",
    "large samples in several clusters are needed .",
