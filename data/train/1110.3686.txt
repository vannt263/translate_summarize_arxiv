    "during the past decades , transition - metal compounds based on cu@xmath11 ions with a @xmath12 configuration and spin-@xmath13 have been intensively studied due to the observation of various exotic collective phenomena in these systems.@xcite a spin gap has been observed in those systems consisting of structural cu dimers with predominant antiferromagnetic intradimer interaction , which is crucial for the occurrence of bose - einstein condensation of magnons such as in tlcucl@xmath14@xcite and bacusi@xmath0o@xmath15.@xcite in another type of spin - gapped systems based on cu dimers , cute@xmath0o@xmath1  as a particular example , the exchange interaction within the structural cu dimer is not predominant , whereas the complex exchange paths between cu ions mediated by the lone - pair cation of te@xmath16 were found to be even stronger.@xcite due to these complex exchange paths , it is still under debate whether the magnetic structure of cute@xmath0o@xmath1  is an alternating spin - chain ( i.e. , one - dimensional ) or an essentially two - dimensional coupled dimer system.@xcite     ( color online ) crystal structure of cute@xmath0o@xmath1   with space group @xmath17 .",

    "the extended hckel tight - binding ( ehtb ) method has been used to investigate the possible exchange paths.@xcite it has been shown that the exchange interaction between the sixth - nearest - neighboring cu ions by a single o - te - o bridge ( @xmath21 ) is strongest and the nearest - neighboring interaction within the structural dimer ( @xmath19 ) is the second strongest , while other exchange paths lead to much smaller exchange interactions between the cu ions ( see fig .",
