    "recently , much interest has been attracted by electronic properties of materials where quasiparticles behave as massless two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac fermions .",

    "@xcite however , scattering mechanisms limiting the transport mobility of graphene are still not fully understood .",
    "for instance , a weak dependence of the mobility on the impurity density found in some experiments  @xcite remains an open problem .",
    "it was argued that this weak dependence could be due to correlations in impurity positions . both negative ,",
    "i.e. , repulsive@xcite and positive , i.e. , attractive correlations could impact the mobility .",
    "an example of the latter is aggregation of impurities into clusters of size of tens of nanometers .",
    "modelled as circularly symmetric potential barriers with sharp boundaries , such finite - size scatterers were predicted  @xcite to degrade the mobility much less compared to random uncorrelated impurities .",
    "another observable signature of finite - size scatterers is a significant difference between the transport time @xmath3 and the quantum lifetime @xmath4 .",

    "although the ratio @xmath5 varies widely among different experiments , it can be as high as a factor of six .",
    "@xcite for massive 2d fermions scattered by random sharp barriers , @xmath6 should approach @xmath7 when the barriers become impenetrable .",
    "@xcite since graphene quasiparticles behave as massless fermions , they can penetrate arbitrary high potential barriers ( lower than the total energy bandwidth ) via the process of klein s tunneling and associated negative refraction .",
    "@xcite therefore , the dependence of @xmath6 on the barrier parameters is another open problem .",
    "for these and other reasons , scattering of quasiparticles by finite - size defects warrants further qualitative and quantitative investigation in order to better understand transport and magnetotransport properties of graphene . while there have been already a number of previous studies of circular potential barriers in graphene ,  @xcite they have not elucidated in a comprehensive way how scattering by such a barrier depends on its size and strength .",
    "furthermore , some of this prior work contains minor errors . in this paper , we correct , refine , and extend these investigations .",
    "the question of what limits the surface electron conduction in topological insulators is even more wide open .",
    "there are few studies that examined scattering of dirac fermions by circular potential barriers in this context although other types of scattering defects have been considered .",

    "for the former , the theory predicts the linear dependence of the conductivity on the electron density @xmath114 , for the latter the conductivity is roughly density - independent.@xcite introducing some degree of correlations among the impurity positions into these basic models modifies the conductivity dependence quantitatively  @xcite but preserves this main dichotomy .",
    "in contrast , in our model the conductance has an approximately @xmath125 dependence [ eq .  ] if the potential barrier is strong enough , @xmath336 .",
    "let us give a specific example .",
    "suppose the potential scatterers of our model are formed by aggregation of charged impurities with average density @xmath337 into circular clusters inside of which the distances between the impurities is about @xmath338",
    ". from the conservation of the total impurity number one concludes that in this model there is an inverse relation between the density @xmath339 of the clusters and their radius @xmath15 : @xmath340 substituting this formula into eq .  , we obtain an estimate of the conductivity @xmath341 which exhibits the @xmath125-behavior .",
    "since @xmath122 is proportional to @xmath15 , formation of clusters greatly increases the conductivity@xcite in comparison to the case of random isolated impurities .",
    "this conclusion is further strengthened by the large numerical factor in eq .  .    the lifetime ratio @xmath6 [ eq .  ]",
    "is another fundamental parameter characterizing the transport properties of the system .",
    "most of previous calculations of @xmath6 have been limited to the perturbation theory ( the born approximation ) , which predicts @xmath342 for the charged and @xmath343 for the short - ranged defects . as we point out in sec .",
    "[ sec : main_results ] and illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetime](c ) , @xmath6 can be less than @xmath20 and even less than @xmath19 for small - radius scatterers because of the resonant tunneling , a non - perturbative effect .",
    "conversely , for large - radius scatterers , @xmath6 can be very large , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetime](a ) .",
    "note that the small lifetime ratio @xmath142 observed in some experiments@xcite while large @xmath344 is found in some others .",
    "@xcite    next , we wish to address the validity of our step - like model of the potential barrier . if the potential is indeed created by a cluster of charged impurities , this model is oversimplified .",
    "the actual potential has no discontinuity .",
    "instead , it sharply but continuously drops over a distance of the order of the screening length , which is usually comparable to the fermi wavelength.@xcite for such a smooth boundary , the reflection and transmission coefficients that enter the ray formula eq .",
    "are modified , e.g. , the reflection coefficient is enhanced.@xcite therefore , the transport and total cross - sections should be greater than what we calculated for a sharp boundary .",
    "the correction is relatively small if both @xmath18 and @xmath33 are large , so that the radius of the cluster is much larger than the fermi wavelength on both sides of the boundary .",
    "however , if either exterior or interior of the cluster is doped weakly , a more accurate calculation will be necessary .",
    "another omission of the step - like model is the long - range tail of the screened coulomb potential induced by the cluster . for high fermi energy",
    "the screening is strong and the effect of such a tail can be treated perturbatively .",
    "a weak long - range potential tail would cause additional small - angle scattering , which should make only a small correction to the transport cross - section .",
    "the effect on the total cross - section could be more substantial . within the hea ,",
    "the contribution of the long - range potential tail to the total cross - section is given by @xcite @xmath345\\ , d j\\ , , \\label{eqn : sigma_tail}\\\\ \\delta\\delta_j & \\simeq -\\dfrac{1}{\\hbar v_f } \\int\\limits_{\\mathrm{max}(a , b)}^{\\infty } \\dfrac{{v}(r ) r d r}{\\sqrt{r^2 - b^2}}\\ , , \\quad b = \\dfrac{j a}{x}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : delta_tail}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is well known that an external charge screened by a gas of 2d electrons ( either massive or massless ) produces the potential that behaves as @xmath346 at distances much larger than the screening length .",
    "it is then easy to see that the integral in eq",
    ".   converges .",
    "thus , there should be a range of parameters where neglecting @xmath347 is legitimate .",
    "however , for massless dirac fermions , large enough total charge of the cluster , and low enough fermi energy , the screened potential would exhibit a slower decay @xmath348 over a range of intermediate distances.@xcite according to eq .",
    ", this may yield logarithmic corrections to the total cross - section .",
    "this interesting problem warrants further study .    in conclusion",
    ", we studied in some depth scattering of massless dirac fermions by a step - like circular potential .",
    "we unified many possible scattering regimes into a single global diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : regime ] ) and presented analytical and numerical results for the scattering amplitude in each of the individual regimes .",
    "we verified that the semiclassical ray formalism accounts for most of the scattering properties in the large-@xmath18 regimes and at the same time provides an intuitive physical description of both the far - field and near - field scattering .",
    "we showed that the ray picture applies even for weak scattering potentials , which is the case where the semiclassical method is usually eschewed in favor of quantum scattering theory .",
    "we also discussed phenomena beyond the ray picture , such as the regularization of the divergence of the scattering amplitude at the rainbow angle and the quantization of the whispering - gallery resonances .",
    "while the perfect axial symmetry and the step - like discontinuity of the potential barrier that enabled us to make progress in terms of analytical theory are not fully realistic , some of our nonperturbative semiclassical techniques can be extended to barriers of more general shapes and profiles .",
    "it may also be interesting to apply our techniques to bilayer graphene and graphene with an externally - induced mass.@xcite we expect the types of the scattering regimes to be the same .",
    "however , because of the energy - dependent fermi velocity , different pseudospin structure , and/or suppression of the klein tunneling by the mass gap in these systems the positions of the regime boundaries and the angular dependence of the differential cross - sections should be different from those for monolayer graphene . finally , we hope that our results may stimulate future transport and scanned - probe experiments with graphene and topological insulators",

    "in order to make the paper self - contained , in this appendix we review the partial wave series . using the notations of ref .   we denote by @xmath349 and @xmath350 , respectively , the incoming and the outgoing waves of angular momentum @xmath26 . at @xmath351 , where @xmath352 , such waves are given by @xmath353",

    "these @xmath371 s and @xmath372 s should not be confused with the plane - wave reflection and transmission coefficients such as @xmath163 and @xmath164 in sec .",
