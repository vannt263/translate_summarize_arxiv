    "this approximation strategy is tested here on oscillation revivals of @xmath8 atoms in a slightly damped mesoscopic field with @xmath9 photons in average  @xcite . in a first stage , we consider the original half - spin / spring case  @xcite with @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for a photon lifetime in the order of one hundred vacuum rabi periods ,",
