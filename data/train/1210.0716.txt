    "the first analyzes the possibility that the asteroids are formed from smaller bodies and the second one introduces a fragmentation model at the light of the voronoi diagrams .      as a simple example of how a distribution with power can be generated , consider the growth of a primeval nebula via accretion , that is the process by which nebulae `` capture '' mass .",
    "we start by considering an uniform pdf for the initial mass of @xmath65 primeval nebulae , @xmath31 , in a range @xmath66 . at each interaction",
    "the @xmath67-th nebula has a probability @xmath68 to increase its mass @xmath69 that is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a parameter of the simulation ; thus more `` massive '' nebulae are more likely to grow , via accretion .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=377 ]      the distribution of fragments size arising from breaking of material is still subject of research as it depends on the actual fragmentation process .",
    "the first model was developed in @xcite : it assumes a time dependent probability of fracture of a ring after a critical strain has been reached in the material .",
    "the resulting distribution show that the frequency of occurrence of fragments masses follows a cumulative distribution of the form : @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the number of fragments each of whose mass is greater or equal to @xmath31 , @xmath65 is the total number of fragments , @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the averaged mass of a fragment .      in order to generate cells resulting in a fractal distribution of their volumes the following method can be adopted , which generalizes the procedure presented in @xcite .    consider a domain @xmath84 subdivided into @xmath85 cubic cells with a linear dimension @xmath86 that , that in the following , will be referred as zero - order cells .",
    "a zero - order cell is divided into @xmath87 smaller cubes called zero - order elements , with linear dimension @xmath88 and volumes @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the volume of zero - order cell .",
    "if@xmath91 is the probability of a zero - order cell to be fragmented , the number @xmath92 of zero - order elements generated by fragmentation is given by @xmath93    and the number @xmath94 of zero - order cells that have been not fragmented is @xmath95    each zero - order element now becomes a first - order cell that can be fragmented into first - order elements of volumes @xmath96 and the number of fragmented first - order elements is @xmath97    the number @xmath98 of first order cells that have not been fragmented is given by    @xmath99    now first - order elements can be considered second - order cells and the procedure repeats itself .",
