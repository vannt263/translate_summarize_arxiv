( [ eq : dimer - singlet - product ] ) ] , is the exact eigenstate of @xmath88 with zero eigenvalue and becomes the exact ground state of the whole hamiltonian if the @xmath1 exchange couplings in the intra - dimer hamiltonian are antiferromagnetic and sufficiently strong .",
    "we note that this mechanism to realize the dimer - singlet - product ground state can be understood from the viewpoint that @xmath220 for each dimer unit is a good quantum number in the model .",
    "this type of the exact ground state has been reported for various frustrated spin models@xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : zeroeigenstate ] ) can be used to derive many other models with an exact ground state .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the inter - dimer hamiltonian , @xmath221 , \\label{eq : modeliiia_inter}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a bipartite lattice .",
    "it is then found that the product state , @xmath222 is the eigenstate of @xmath88 with zero eigenvalue .",

    "furthermore , if the excitation gap of the intra - dimer hamiltonian is large enough , the product state becomes the exact ground state of the whole hamiltonian .",
    "in such a manner , we can construct several models having an exact ground state written as a direct product of the dimer - singlet state @xmath226 , the dimer - triplet state with zero magnetization @xmath223 , and the spin - nematic state @xmath224 .",
    "in summary , we have studied frustrated quantum spin systems consisting of spin - dimer units , eq .  ( [ eq : h_whole ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the systems in certain parameter regions has an exact ground state written in the form of direct product of dimer states . in the argument",

    "we then showed that the eigenstate becomes an exact ground state of the whole hamiltonian ( the sum of the inter- and intra - dimer hamiltonian ) when the coupling parameters in the intra - dimer hamiltonian are selected appropriately .",
    "in such a way , we have found several models each of which has the exact ground state of the form of product of dimer states , including the product of the dimer - singlet states [ eq .",

    "the cases where the inter - dimer exchange terms @xmath71 and @xmath72 acting on a two - dimer product state give zero , which are summarized in table [ tab : zero_state ] , can be divided into the following three groups .",

    "second , it follows from eq .",

    "third , there are other non - trivial cases where the @xmath85 terms @xmath71 yield zero . for instance , the outcome of @xmath94 acting on @xmath74 is given by @xmath236   \\nonumber \\\\ & & ~~~~~~~~~\\times \\left ( | \\uparrow \\downarrow \\rangle_j + | \\downarrow \\uparrow \\rangle_j \\right ) \\left ( | \\uparrow \\downarrow \\rangle_{j ' } - | \\downarrow \\uparrow \\rangle_{j ' } \\right ) .",

    "we note that the state ( [ eq : hxy+-_phiphi ] ) is zero also in the case of @xmath238 and @xmath239 . in our argument",
    ", we consider only the case of @xmath237 and @xmath97 since these two cases give the same state @xmath74 up to an overall factor .",
    "in addition , the state ( [ eq : hxy+-_phiphi ] ) becomes zero for arbitrary @xmath102 and @xmath240 if @xmath241 or @xmath242 .",
    "we ignore these cases of @xmath241 and @xmath242 in our argument as they correspond to the trivial states @xmath243 and @xmath244 , respectively .    in a similar way",
