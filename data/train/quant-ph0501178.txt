    "show that the subject of irreversible nonequilibrium dynamics is by no means settled .",
    "it is not the purpose of this paper to attempt such a difficult review , nor to address the related fundamental issues lurking beneath interpretation ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "rather we wish to address the model problem recently outlined in @xcite .",
    "this model may prove useful to complement various historical and contemporary efforts to extend linear markovian theories of dissipative phenomena and relaxation based on master equations , lindblad and langevin equations , to the nonlinear and far nonequilibrium domain .",
    "for example , spectroscopic studies of the effects of vibrational relaxation on line shapes of two - level electronic transitions can not be regularized under the markovian approximations so that various nonlinear approaches are being developed and tested @xcite in some cases at the expense of giving up preservation of ( complete ) positivity @xcite or hermiticity @xcite of the ( reduced ) density operator .",
    "again , it is not our purpose here to review the literature of these specific potential applications of our model dynamics , nor to apply it explicitly to particular examples .",
    "rather we wish to focus on illustrating its general features ( including preservation of positivity and hermiticity at all times , even backwards ) that make it a good candidate ( that is , compatible with all reasonable requirements imposed by thermodynamic principles @xcite ) of extensions of the traditional linear master equations for open system dynamics , capable to include the description of nonlinear spontaneous relaxation within the system ( even if isolated ) by energy redistribution between the occupied levels .",
    "we consider an isolated , closed system composed of non - interacting identical particles with single - particle energy levels @xmath0 with @xmath1 where @xmath14 is assumed finite for simplicity and the @xmath0 s are repeated in case of degeneracy .",
    "we restrict our attention on the class of dilute - boltzmann - gas states in which the particles are independently distributed among the @xmath14 ( possibly degenerate ) one - particle energy eigenstates . in density operator language , this is tantamount to restricting the attention on the subset of one - particle density operators that are diagonal in the representation which diagonalizes the one - particle hamiltonian operator .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 the occupation probability of the @xmath15-th eigenstate , so that the per - particle mean energy , normalization and entropy functionals are given by the relations @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the vector of @xmath10 s , the boltzmann constant @xmath18 may be used to nondimensionalize @xmath19 ( or we may assume for simplicity @xmath20 unit of entropy ) , and of course @xmath21 for any normalized distribution @xmath17 .    as is well known , for a given value of @xmath22 , the thermodynamic - equilibrium canonical distribution @xmath23 has inverse temperature @xmath24 and maximal entropy @xmath25 .",
    "we are interested in studying the dynamics of a nonequilibrium distribution obtained , for example , by exciting some energy eigenstates .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , a way to alter the distribution is to repopulate ( e.g. , by selective laser heating ) or depopulate ( in principle , by selective cooling or resonance fluorescence ) a subset of eigenstates .",
    "this is described by multiplying each @xmath26 by a perturbation factor @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 ) ( repopulation @xmath29 , depopulation @xmath30 ) and then renormalizing , to yield the perturbed nonequilibrium distribution @xmath31 of course , in general the perturbed distribution has a different mean energy @xmath32 and different entropy @xmath33 . however , a proper choice of the perturbation factors @xmath34 may maintain @xmath35 , in which case @xmath36 ( see section [ numerical ] ) .    to describe the relaxation towards the new target canonical equilibrium distribution @xmath37 , the dynamical equation proposed in @xcite is , for @xmath38 ,    [ lemanska1 ] @xmath39 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath40    this equation does have the capability of continuously rearranging the distribution so that the perturbed distribution evolves towards the maximal entropy target distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ canonical ] ) with energy @xmath41 .",
    "however , in the far - nonequilibrium region it has the defect to imply the unphysical feature that an initially unpopulated eigenstate gets populated at an infinite rate .",
    "this feature is in contrast with a wealth of successful models of physical systems in which by limiting our attention to a subset of relevant single - particle eigenstates we get good results , that are relatively robust with respect to adding to the model other less relevant , unpopulated or little populated eigenstates . according to eq .",
    "[ lemanska1 ] , instead , distributions where some eigenstates are very little populated would survive only for extremely short times .    the equation of motion that we propose for the time evolution of the perturbed distribution is , for @xmath42 ,    [ mainequation1 ] @xmath43 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath44    we show in section [ equation ] that the apparently slight modification with respect to eq .",
    "( [ lemanska1 ] ) not only fixes the cited defect , while maintaining the relevant overall features of conserving energy , normalization , nonnegativity of the probabilities and maintaining the entropy generation rate nonnegative .",
    "it also features existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the cauchy problem for all times , @xmath45 , and entails a large class of partially - canonical equilibrium distributions that are unstable , as well as a single conditionally - stable canonical equilibrium distribution for each value of the energy , as required by a well - known statement of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "we show in section [ equation ] that the structure of eq.([mainequation1 ] ) is the same as that of the general nonlinear quantum equation we discuss in a series of papers written over twenty years ago @xcite in which we develop and propose a nonlinear quantum dynamics in an attempt to unite ordinary quantum mechanics and general equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "as acknowledged also in @xcite , the nonlinear quantum dynamical law first proposed by this author @xcite does have very intriguing and appealing mathematical features .",
    "we must admit however that the physical interpretation , motivation and context of our pioneering scheme is still considered adventurous @xcite by most of the physical community , although we would prefer to term it revolutionary in the sense of kuhn @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in this paper we do not pursue such controversial interpretation , but we wish to emphasize that  leaving aside its interpretation and focusing attention only on its mathematics  our previous work represents to our knowledge the first time that the steepest - entropy - ascent ( or maximal - entropy - generation ) ansatz has been explicitly formulated and implemented in a general dynamical law capable of describing the relaxation of arbitrary nonequilibrium states towards thermodynamic equilibrium .    in section [ construction ]",
    "we provide a derivation of eq.([mainequation1 ] ) from the assumption that the occupation probability distribution evolves along the steepest - entropy - ascent trajectory in the state space defined in terms not of the @xmath10 s but of their positive square roots @xmath11 s . in section [ fluctuation ]",
    "we derive a fluctuation - dissipation formulation of the equation and in section [ variational ] a variational formulation .    in section [ twolevel ]",
    "we discuss a simplest degenerate case in which the relaxation equation admits an analytical solution , and we compare results with those numerically derived from the natural extension of eq .",
    "( [ lemanska1 ] ) to such case .",

    "moreover , eq .  ( [ mainequation ] ) is well - behaved not only in forward time but also in backward time , consistently with the strongest form of the principle of causality , by which future states of a strictly isolated system should unfold deterministically from initial states along smooth unique trajectories in state domain defined for all times ( future as well as past ) . indeed , for any given arbitrary initial distribution @xmath58 we can follow the unique trajectory @xmath68 for @xmath69 . in forward time",

    "the only canonical distribution that is @xmath22-conditionally stable is the one for which all energy eigenstates are occupied , i.e. , the maximal - entropy canonical distribution ( [ canonical ] ) .    by interpreting the entropy @xmath19 as a measure of how ` well ' the energy is distributed among the available energy eigenstates ,",
    "the proposed nonlinear dynamics describes a spontaneous internal redistribution of the energy along the path of maximal entropy increase leading towards an ` optimally ' distributed ( highest - entropy ) state compatible with the condition of maintaining unoccupied the initially unoccupied energy eigenstates .",
    "in this section , we provide a brief derivation of eq.([mainequation ] ) from the assumption that the occupation probability distribution evolves along the steepest - entropy - ascent trajectory in the proper state space .",

    ", the proposed rate equations implement the fundamental ansatz that nonequilibrium time dependence follows the path of steepest - entropy - ascent ( or , using the terminology adopted in @xcite , maximal entropy generation ) .",
