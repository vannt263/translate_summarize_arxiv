    "it has already become a text book level piece of knowledge that galactic nuclei in general contain an extended cluster of old stars surrounding the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "the properties of such a star cluster in the galactic centre ( gc ) have been discussed many times in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the mass of the smbh ( @xmath5 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and its distance from the sun ( @xmath6 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "improvement of observational instruments and techniques in the past few decades , however , led to a surprising discovery of a significant number of young stars in the innermost parsec of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) which appear to be orbiting the central smbh on near - keplerian orbits .",
    "those in the immediate vicinity of the smbh , the so - called s - stars , have been identified as quite usual , @xmath7 old stars of spectral type b with randomly oriented orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "stars that are observed farther out ( projected distance @xmath8 ) have been identified as massive , @xmath9 old ob- or wr - stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "contrary to the s - stars , it has been suggested @xcite that a non - negligible subset of these massive stars form a coherently rotating stellar structure around the smbh  a stellar disc , which is commonly called the clockwise system ( cws ) .",
    "this exciting possibility inspired many authors to study various aspects of the dynamical evolution of such stellar discs .",
    "attention has been mostly paid to the evolution of eccentricities and inclinations of the stellar orbits in the disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to the still ongoing debate about the origin of those young stars that are observed off the suggested disc plane .",
    "evolution of another important quantity , semi - major axes of the orbits in the disc , which determines its radial structure has been , however , usually neglected . among others , overlooking this question",
    "might have had the two following causes .",
    "first , raw estimates of the classical two - body relaxation time , which is supposed to be adequate for changes of orbital energy , gave , considering the parameters of the old star cluster , orders of magnitude larger values than the age of the young stars .",
    "in contrast , the characteristic time - scale of resonant relaxation ( either vector or scalar ) that are relevant for changes of angular momentum and , consequently , eccentricity and inclination is estimated to be of the order of millions of years .",
    "second , analyses of the observational data usually led to a statement that the surface ( number ) density profile of the cws is compatible with a single power - law @xmath10 with @xmath1 @xcite which is widely accepted to be a natural outcome of the likely formation scenario of such stellar discs @xcite and , therefore , there seems nothing interesting to be done .    nevertheless , most recently , pieces of evidence that a broken power - law surface density profile may better fit the observational data have been reported .",
    "@xcite find values @xmath11 and @xmath12 with a break - point at @xmath13 for which they do not provide any explanation . furthermore ,",
    "although not giving explicit values of the broken power - law indices , @xcite find a sort of plateau in their surface density profile which is followed by a sharp drop of density beyond @xmath14 .",
    "is there any dynamical reason for a broken power - law to be a better description of an evolved stellar disc around a smbh ? in this paper , we address this question .",
    "a classical formula for two - body relaxation time within a self - gravitating system of stars of mass @xmath15 , number density @xmath16 and velocity dispersion @xmath17 reads @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 stands for the gravitational constant and @xmath20 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "formula  ( [ eq : t_relax ] ) gives values of the order of @xmath21 for the old star cluster in the gc when replacing @xmath17 with keplerian orbital velocity around the smbh , @xmath22 : @xmath23 here , @xmath24 denotes the number of stars below radius @xmath25 .",
    "the situation is , however , different if we consider a thin stellar disc whose density ( both mass and number ) exceeds the density of the old nuclear star cluster . at the same time , and more importantly , relative velocities of stars within the coherently rotating disc are much smaller than their orbital velocity .",
    "both these facts lead to a considerable ( orders of magnitude ) shortening of the two - body relaxation time - scale within a thin stellar disc with respect to what could be inferred from the parameters of the old star cluster .",
    "the theory of relaxation of thin discs of bodies driven by their mutual gravitational interaction has already been well established in the context of protoplanetary discs .",
    "let us thus forward the reader to the paper @xcite which summarises different theoretical approaches to the problem .",
    "the authors derive equation ( 4.10 ) for temporal evolution of the mean square eccentricity which can be rewritten in the form @xmath26{with } t_\\mathrm{char } = \\frac{0.06}{\\alpha }   \\frac{{\\langle e^2 \\rangle}^2}{\\omega\\ , \\sigma\\ , r^2 }   \\left ( \\frac{{m_\\bullet}}{m_\\ast } \\right)^2\\ ; , \\label{eq : dedt}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the mass of individual bodies in the disc ( stars in our case ) , @xmath28 is the mass of the central body which dominates the gravitational potential ( the smbh ) , @xmath29 is the surface number density of the ( stellar ) disc and @xmath30 is the keplerian angular velocity ; @xmath31 is a numerical factor of the order of unity which can be tuned by comparison with @xmath2-body integration .",
    "@xcite report @xmath32 as a suitable choice and we will adopt this value hereafter .",
    "@xmath33 introduced in ( [ eq : dedt ] ) approximately corresponds to the time required for @xmath34 to grow by a factor of two and , due to its dependence upon @xmath34 , it may be arbitrarily short . a better sense of the characteristic time - scale is obtained by integration of equation ( [ eq : dedt ] ) which gives the time for mean square eccentricity to grow from initial ( nearly zero value ) to @xmath34 : @xmath35    for a stellar disc of total mass @xmath36 and radial surface density profile @xmath37 ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , formula ( [ eq : te ] ) gives @xmath40 we see that at least for the inner parts of the young stellar disc in the galactic centre , the characteristic time for change of orbital elements is comparable to its age .",
    "one of the methods discussed by @xcite that led to derivation of formula ( [ eq : dedt ] ) is based on evaluation of diffuse coefficients in the fokker - planck equation , quadratic in velocity .",
    "these were then transformed to changes in square of eccentricity and inclination . as the orbital energy is also a quadratic form of velocity , it is reasonable to expect that the characteristic time for evolution of the radius of the orbit is similar to that expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : te ] ) and ( [ eq : te2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , we expect that radial density profile of the stellar disc in the gc may have changed during its life - time .",
    "let us note that our assumption about the evolution of semi - major axes goes beyond the analytical work of @xcite and it requires justification by a suitable numerical model which we present below .",
    "the rate of radial migration has to be a function of the radial density profile which determines strength of the two - body relaxation .",
    "a stationary solution requires a bulk accretion rate independent of radius @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath41 one possible candidate for the stationary disc density profile is the @xcite solution with distribution function of semi - major axes @xmath42 which implies @xmath43 . in spite of",
    "that this solution was derived under the assumption of spherical symmetry , underlying energetic balance arguments are not affected by this assumption .",
    "bearing this caveat in mind we may further speculate that due to rather strong radial dependence of the characteristic time , the stationary solution would settle in the inner parts of the disc , while the outer parts would still keep imprints of the initial state .",
    "hence , for initial @xmath44 which clearly differs from the expected stationary state , we would obtain a broken power - law surface density profile of the stellar disc .",
    "in order to investigate evolution of the disc density profile , we set up a model integrated numerically by means of direct @xmath2-body integration code nbody6 @xcite .",
    "with respect to the original publicly available version of the code , we added a fixed keplerian potential representing the central smbh of mass @xmath45 .",
    "young stellar disc is represented by 1200 point - like particles with mass function @xmath46 in the range @xmath47 ; the total mass of the disc is @xmath48 .",
    "the adopted values of parameters of the mass function are motivated by recent work of @xcite who investigated properties of the population of young stars in the gc .",
    "the stars were initially set on circular orbits with normalised angular momentum vectors distributed uniformly with maximum deviation of @xmath49 from the mean ( i.e. the initial disc opening angle is @xmath50 ) .",
    "we investigated models with initial power - law surface density profile @xmath51 with several different values of index @xmath52 .",
    "the radial extent of the disc is set to an interval @xmath53 .    in order to clearly distinguish general trends from random fluctuations , we set up typically 20 numerical realisations of each model , showing results averaged over all realisations below",
    ". the reliability of our numerical approach has been tested by comparison with qualitatively similar models of @xcite  see appendix  [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "thin dotted lines show dependency @xmath54 for comparison . ]",
    "we followed dynamical evolution of the stellar disc to @xmath55 . in terms of the mean ( square ) eccentricity and inclination ,",
    "the evolution is similar for all models ( which differ by the value of index @xmath56 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : mean_ei2 ] , we show results for @xmath1 which corresponds to commonly accepted theoretically plausible surface density profile of a stellar disc formed by self - gravitational fragmentation of parent gaseous disc",
    ". both mean values of squared eccentricity and inclination , @xmath34 and @xmath57 , gradually grow , i.e. the velocity dispersion within the disc evolves towards isotropy and the disc becomes geometrically thicker . at later stages ,",
    "evolution of eccentricity follows theoretically predicted relation @xmath58 ( eq .  [ eq : te ] , see also * ? ? ?",
    "according to our numerical model , inclinations evolve somewhat faster than eccentricities and the expected relation @xmath59 holds only approximately .",
    "this apparent discrepancy is due to that the theoretical prediction does not consider temporal evolution of the disc surface density . @xcite",
    "have shown ( and we have also verified on appropriate models ",
    "see appendix  [ sec : appendix ] ) that after renormalisation to constant surface density , evolution of the mean square eccentricity and inclination matches the theoretical lines much better .",
    "the renormalisation to constant density is , however , not possible for models with radially dependent surface density which differs by more than an order of magnitude between the inner and outer edge .     for model with initial distribution @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 ( solid line ) .",
    "thin dotted line shows the initial state . ]    in contrary to inclinations and eccentricities , moments of the distribution of semi - major axes do not provide so clear view on temporal evolution of the system .",
    "this is mainly due to already initial order of magnitude spread of semi - major axes which even grows in time ",
    "few stars become unbound , i.e. reaching negative values of semi - major axis , few others are scattered to loosely bound orbits with @xmath62 .",
    "we therefore plot the distribution function , @xmath63 , of semi - major axes itself at @xmath64 for the model with @xmath65 in figure  [ fig : na-2 ] .",
    "the evolved distribution function clearly can not be fitted by a single power - law .",
    "for @xmath66 it is still close to the initial shape , @xmath67 , while in the range @xmath68 the distribution function is roughly constant ( cf .",
    "the @xcite solution , @xmath42 ) .",
    "the above introduced numerical model gives @xmath69 at @xmath70 ( which is the estimated age of the young stars in the gc ) .",
    "for the parameters of the model and this value of the mean eccentricity , formula  ( [ eq : te2 ] ) gives characteristic time @xmath71 at the disc inner edge if we replace @xmath15 with @xmath72 which equals @xmath73 in our case .",
    "the fact that the numerical model shows evident disc evolution up to @xmath74 already at @xmath75 is likely due to the broad mass spectrum which is known to accelerate the two - body relaxation driven evolution of self - gravitating systems .",
    "figure  [ fig : na ] demonstrates that the flattening of the distribution of the semi - major axes in the inner parts of the disc holds for a wide range of initial values of index @xmath56 .",
    "this suggests a possibility that there exists an equilibrium state , towards which the two - body relaxation of a thin stellar disc around a dominating central mass leads .",
    "the equilibrium state inferred from our numerical models , @xmath76 , appears to be close to the @xcite solution mentioned in section  [ sec : theory ] . due to the radial dependence of the relaxation time",
    ", the flat distribution of semi - major axes settles first in the inner parts of the disc and gradually propagates outwards . in the outer parts of the disc , where the two - body relaxation time - scale is still longer than the evolution time ,",
    "the distribution is affected much less .",
    "a generic consequence of the shear which acts in differentially rotating discs is their radial spreading ( both inward and outward ) .",
    "we attribute two features of the distribution shown in figure  [ fig : na ] to this process : first , it is the steepening of the initial density profile , visible particularly for model with @xmath77 beyond @xmath78 , which is due to stars that migrated outward from the inner , very dense region .",
    "second , as the rate of radial migration is proportional to the disc density , we see more prominent inward migration of stars across the initial disc inner radius for steeper density profiles ( lower @xmath56 )",
    ". we will discuss this effect in section  [ sec : conclusions ] in the context of the s - stars .",
    ", as indicated in each panel .",
    "solid lines show evolved states at @xmath70 , while thin dotted lines represent the initial states . ]",
    "distribution of the semi - major axes of the young stars in the gc can not be determined from the observational data without some  priori assumptions about their configuration .",
    "hence , instead of attempting to compare the output of our model with ( biased ) deprojected structure of the system of young stars in the gc , we plot projected surface density of the system in our model in figure  [ fig : sigma ] . for this purpose ,",
    "we choose angle @xmath79 between the line - of - sight and the symmetry axis of the disc which corresponds to the inclination of the young stellar disc in the gc with respect to the plane of the sky given by @xcite ; other authors report only slightly different values , e.g. @xmath80 is the best fit of @xcite who identified the young stellar disc for the first time . together with the lines determined from our numerical models ,",
    "we show projected surface density of _ all _ the young stars in the gc ( points in figure  [ fig : sigma ] ) as given in @xcite .",
    "we do not consider reasonable to fit the models against the surface density determined from observations which suffers from too large errors .",
    "still , according to a by - eye comparison , the model with initial density profile @xmath81 in @xmath82 somewhat differs from the observational data .",
    "hence , we also show results for another model with @xmath83 and @xmath84 which matches the observational data reasonably well .",
    "comparison of the two models further indicates that the profile below @xmath85 is not much affected by manipulation with the model parameters , while these may be eventually used to fit the observational data in the outer parts of the disc . in this context ,",
    "the most recently reported smaller outer radius of the disc at @xmath86 pc @xcite can also be straightforwardly accommodated .",
    ", of the evolved stellar disc with initial value of index @xmath83 within the interval @xmath87 ( solid line ) and @xmath65 for @xmath88(dashed line ) .",
    "thin dotted line shows the initial state of the model with @xmath83 .",
    "the data points represent projected density as determined by @xcite with scaling @xmath89 .",
    "note that the rightmost data point was not displayed in figure  13 of the original paper as the authors restricted themselves to the region below @xmath90 .",
    "the modelled density profiles are normalised arbitrarily to match the observational data . ]",
    "in previous sections , we have learned that the two - body relaxation can lead to rapid changes of the density profile of a stellar disc around a smbh .",
    "the question now is whether this process can not be marginalised by some other , stronger effect . in section  [ sec : theory ] we have indirectly argued that the two - body relaxation within the whole central star cluster is likely to act on an orders of magnitude longer time - scale than the two - body relaxation within the disc .",
    "another forms of relaxation , in particular the vector resonant relaxation , however , may be stronger opponents .",
    "the characteristic time - scale of the vector resonant relaxation is @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the orbital period of a star on orbit with semi - major axis @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the number of stars with semi - major axis @xmath95 . for a star cluster with radial density profile",
    "@xmath96 this roughly implies @xmath97 with @xmath98 denoting the mass of the nuclear star cluster below @xmath99 .",
    "the process of vector resonant relaxation generally leads to changes of orientations of the orbits , i.e. it tends to disrupt ( thicken ) the disc . similarly to the two - body relaxation within the disc , it is efficient mainly at small radii . a full @xmath2-body model including the old star cluster is needed to determine , whether the resonant relaxation among the young and old stars could dominate over the two - body relaxation within the disc and , consequently , suppress the evolution of its radial density profile .",
    "a true full @xmath2-body model of the inner parsec of the gc is beyond our current computational capabilities .",
    "nevertheless , in order to obtain some test of influence of the self - gravitating nuclear star cluster upon the dynamical evolution of the disc , we introduce a simplified model .",
    "the stellar disc is represented by 200 equal - mass stars of mass @xmath100 , forming an initially thin disc with opening angle @xmath101 which spans from @xmath99 to @xmath102 with surface density @xmath81 ( i.e. with the distribution of semi - major axes falling as @xmath103 ) .",
    "we followed evolution of either the standalone disc in the dominating potential of the central smbh of mass @xmath104 or with the central keplerian potential superposed with a smooth potential of mass with radial density profile @xmath105 ( i.e. the @xcite solution ) and , finally the stellar disc embedded in a spherical cluster of 8000 stars of mass @xmath106 with @xcite distribution of semi - major axes and thermal ( @xmath107 ) distribution of eccentricities .",
    "the evolved distributions of semi - major axes are shown in figure  [ fig : na - nbody ] .",
    "the individual models give results that are close enough to each other to make a conclusion that the presence of the spherical old star cluster affects the evolution of the stellar disc only marginally .    beside the random torques from individual stars of the old star cluster , a systematic influence of massive sources of gravity upon the young stellar disc",
    "could also weaken the impact of two - body relaxation .",
    "such sources have already been discussed in the literature .",
    "let us mention work of @xcite and @xcite who considered evolution of two stellar discs due to mutual gravitational torques , works of @xcite and @xcite taking into account torque exerted on the stellar disc by external massive gaseous torus , or paper of @xcite dealing with the torques due to remnants of the gaseous disc which gave birth to the young stars .",
    "a general statement about the effect of systematic torques from massive , roughly axisymmetric source of gravity upon the young stellar disc is that it leads to a change of the orientation of the orbits of the stars in the disc .",
    "the strength of the effect rapidly decreases with the separation of the particular star and the perturbing source . in accord with this ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite concluded that the perturbations under their consideration affect mainly the outer parts of the disc , i.e. the two - body relaxation is likely to be dominant in the inner parts of the stellar disc . in the case of two ,",
    "mutually interacting discs of similar radii , it is a matter of their mass , whether this interaction will lead to a fast puff - up ( i.e. lowering their densities ) which could make the two - body relaxation marginal .",
    "we have shown that two - body relaxation may play an important role in evolution of the radial density profile of a thin stellar disc around a supermassive black hole given the disc is initially near - circular .",
    "this assumption keeps the relative velocities of the stars in the disc low enough to enable them to effectively interact .",
    "in particular , considering the parameters of the young nuclear cluster in the galactic centre , such a disc evolves on a time - scale comparable to its age .",
    "the question of evolution of semi - major axes of stars forming a self - gravitating disc around a smbh was also addressed by @xcite who did not find any significant evolution of the radial density profile in their numerical models .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that their distribution of initial eccentricities of the orbits in the disc was peaked at value @xmath108 .",
    "from the point of view of dynamical evolution , the results of @xcite are in accord with our findings as our calculations confirm that after @xmath108 is reached , the evolution of the distribution of semi - major axes is negligible . in addition",
    ", @xcite also noticed accelerated energy relaxation in their models of stellar discs with small initial eccentricities ( @xmath109 ) , attributing it ( as we do ) to low relative velocities and high density .",
    "let us emphasise that it is important to be cautious when interpreting the observational data with respect to the theoretical expectations about the _",
    "initial _ state of the system under consideration .",
    "in particular , in this paper we have shown that starting from a rather simple initial configuration , the dynamical evolution of the young stellar system in the gc over a few millions of years may lead to a state compatible with recent observational data . within the framework of our model ,",
    "the characteristic time - scale of the disc evolution grows with the radial distance from the centre ( for reasonable initial profiles ) .",
    "we thus suggest that only the outer parts of the disc ( @xmath110 ) may serve for determining its initial state . in the inner parts , where the two - body relaxation is more efficient",
    ", the distribution of semi - major axes tends to be flat , implying the surface density decreasing roughly as @xmath111 which is remarkably close to the value reported by @xcite .",
    "we have further shown that large density at the inner edge of the disc leads to its significant spreading towards the centre .",
    "for @xmath65 we obtained minimum value of semi - major axis averaged over 20 realisations of the numerical model @xmath112 at @xmath70 , i.e. less than one half of the initial inner radius of the disc .",
    "for @xmath77 we got even lower value , @xmath113 .",
    "hence , we speculate that two - body relaxation may have played an important role for the s - stars which are orbiting the supermassive black hole with semi - major axes @xmath114 . although it seems that even a disc with the unrealistically steep initial density profile does not provide sufficiently tight orbits , the two - body relaxation may have worked on a longer period of time provided the s - stars originate from some previous star formation episode and , at the same time , if not placing the s - stars to their orbits , two - body relaxation may have helped to do so other processes , e.g. the tidal disruption of binaries on highly eccentric orbits around the smbh ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "let us note that the numerical results can be directly rescaled to arbitrary @xmath28 and @xmath128 which implies time scaling @xmath129 with @xmath130 . beside this trivial scaling , @xcite state that the temporal evolution of @xmath121 and @xmath122 can be scaled for varying disc surface density and mass of individual bodies ( planetesimals in their case , stars in the context of our paper ) in the disc .",
    "in particular , they show that two discs with surface densities @xmath131 and @xmath132 and disc bodies masses @xmath133 and @xmath134 will give @xmath135 and , analogically , @xmath136 with @xmath137    we have tested this scaling by means of two additional models , one with 256 particles of mass @xmath126 and the other one with 40 particles of mass @xmath138 . in both cases ,",

    "<S> the profile becomes rather flat ( @xmath3 ) while the outer parts keep imprints of the initial state . </S>",
