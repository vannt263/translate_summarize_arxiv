    "in recent years , _ ab initio _ many - body nuclear structure calculations , such as the no core shell model ( ncsm ) and green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) have significantly progressed , to realistically describe heavier and heavier nuclei @xcite . in the last few years",
    ", these calculations have been able to reproduce observables of light atomic nuclei up to a=14 . to deal with heavier nuclei ( @xmath2 ) , even at the current level of accessible computing power ,",
    "it is unavoidable to adopt model space restrictions which have to be accompanied by proper renormalization of bare nn and nnn interactions .",
    "significant efforts have been devoted to developing the coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations ( ccsd ) @xcite , the importance truncation scheme @xcite and to recast the _ ab initio _",
    "ncsm approach by introducing a core and few - body valence clusters @xcite .",
    "those studies are usually focused on binding energies and nuclear excitation spectra .",
    "the electromagnetic and semi - leptonic operators , on the other hand , have been studied less frequently , and , less is known about their renormalization .",
    "one of the recent studies @xcite , for example , shows that the long - range quadrupole operator undergoes insufficiently weak renormalization in the two - body cluster approximation .",
    "this is in contrast to short - range strong interactions and short - range operators , which are well - renormalized , even in the two - body cluster approximation .    to explore the role of higher - body correlations for proper renormalization of the long - range e2 operator",
    ", we can use the valence cluster expansion ( vce ) considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "since the effective p - shell interactions constructed in this approximation account exactly for six - body correlations , it is also possible to construct the effective two - body e2 operator which accounts for those six - body cluster correlations .",
    "+ in this paper , we present a detailed study of the properties of the effective e2 operator in the ncsm formalism when projected onto a single major shell .",
    "the construction of our effective e2 operator , which acts in a @xmath1 valence space , is achieved as follows .",
    "we first performed a @xmath3 ncsm calculation , for both @xmath4li and @xmath4he , using the non - local cd - bonn potential @xcite .",
    "this ncsm calculation uses as input the effective interaction for @xmath5li , obtained in the two - body cluster approximation . here",
    ", @xmath6 corresponds to the total oscillator quanta ( @xmath7 ) above the minimum configuration and varies from 2 to 16 . after a renormalization to the @xmath8 space , the resulting quadrupole moments and e2 matrix elements form the one - body part of the effective e2 operator for the @xmath9-shell . a @xmath3 @xmath5li ncsm calculation",
    "is then performed for the same range of @xmath6 , as before . after a similar renormalization to the @xmath8 space ,",
    "the matrix elements of the e2 operator in this case contain both one- and two - body parts . by using the results from the @xmath4li and @xmath4he calculations ,",
    "we are able to subtract the one - body contribution from the @xmath5li e2 matrix elements and are left with the pure two - body contribution .",
    "this step is necessary , as the effective operator will contain two - body contributions , even though the bare operator does not .",
    "we are , thus , able to construct an effective e2 operator from the one- and two - body contributions as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "we demonstrate that the two - body effective e2 operator can conveniently be parametrized in terms of j - dependent one - body effective charges .",
    "these effective charges account exactly for the one - body contributions as well as averaged two - body contributions .",
    "the starting point of the ncsm approach is the bare , exact a - body hamiltonian with the addition ( and later subtraction ) of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) potential @xcite :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the one - body ho hamiltonian @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a bare nn interaction @xmath14 , modified by the term introducing a- and @xmath15-dependent corrections to partly offset the ho potential present in @xmath11 : @xmath16 another offset occurs for the center of mass ( cm ) part of the ho potential and the cm part of the kinetic energy operator , both present in eq.([homa ] ) , with the addition of a lagrange constraint , @xmath17 , and with @xmath18 chosen large and positive . here , @xmath19 is the ho hamiltonian in the cm coordinates .",
    "the eigenvalue problem for the exact a - body hamiltonian ( [ homa ] ) for @xmath20 is very complicated technically , since an extremely large a - body ho basis is required to obtain converged results .",
    "the two - body cluster ( 2bc ) approximation , consisting of solving eq.([homa ] ) for the @xmath21-body subsystem of a particles , is commonly used @xcite to construct effective two - body interactions for solving the a - body problem in restricted model spaces .",
    "however , the 2bc approach does not account for 3- and higher - body correlations in the effective interaction . to include the higher - body effects into the effective shell model interaction ,",
    "we have recently developed @xcite the two- and three - body valence cluster ( 2bvc and 3bvc ) approximation , which includes higher - body correlations up to 6- and 7-body , respectively .",
    "we generalize this technique in order to compute effective shell model electromagnetic operators , as described below .",
    "let us start with the assumption that we have derived a set of effective hamiltonians @xmath22 for different values of @xmath6 following the prescription given in @xcite .",
    "according to the previously adopted notation , the first upper index ( 0 ) indicates that the effective hamiltonian is constructed for the @xmath1 space ( e.g. , for the p - shell ) .",
    "the second upper index , @xmath6 , indicates that the given effective hamiltonian , when diagonalized in the p - shell , exactly reproduces the low - lying ncsm results obtained in the @xmath3 space .",
    "the second lower index , @xmath23 , refers to the order of cluster expansion employed .",
    "finally , the first lower index , a , specifies the mass number of the nucleus , for which this effective interaction is constructed . for simplicity we will omit all these indices below and will label the effective hamiltonian , @xmath24 , corresponding to a subset of states with total spin , j. the eigenvectors of the effective hamiltonian @xmath24 form the unitary transformation @xmath25 , which reduces @xmath24 in the @xmath1 space to diagonal form : @xmath26 this same eigenstate matrix @xmath25 can also be used to calculate the matrix elements of other effective operators , @xmath27 , between eigenstates with spins @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the @xmath1 space : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the tensor rank of the operator @xmath32 ; and @xmath33 or @xmath34 denotes electric or magnetic multipole radiation . the required operator mapping procedure imposed on the matrix elements of the effective operator @xmath35 , calculated with the eigenvectors in the @xmath1 space , is that they are identical to the matrix elements @xmath36 of the bare one - body operator , obtained from the ncsm calculation in the large @xmath3 space , _ i.e. _ , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a projector into the @xmath23-body 0@xmath39 space .",
    "a standard ncsm procedure exists for calculating effective operators , starting from the bare operator in a large space @xcite .",
    "that is , the matrix @xmath40 is the original bare operator @xmath41 transformed to the eigenbasis in the full @xmath42 space analogous to the one expressed in eq.(5 ) .",
    "this technique has been tested in a two - body cluster approximation ; however , it becomes cumbersome in the case of higher - cluster approximations . to overcome this problem",
    ", we first calculate the bare matrix elements , @xmath43 , using eigenstates obtained in the @xmath6 space",
    ". then the matrix elements of effective operators can be determined using the inverse transformation to the one given by eq.([op1 ] ) , where the @xmath44 matrix is replaced by the @xmath45 matrix : @xmath46 according to the definition ( _ i.e. _ , eq.([me_id ] ) ) of an effective operator .",
    "the effective @xmath27 operator can be represented in the standard shell model ( ssm ) format , using the valence cluster expansion ( vce ) ( similar to the vce for the effective hamiltonian in @xcite ) , @xmath47 where the upper index , @xmath48 , stands for @xmath48-body part of the effective operator in the @xmath49-body valence cluster ( @xmath50 ) ; the first lower index @xmath51 , for the mass dependence ; the second lower index @xmath52 , for the number of particles contributing to corresponding @xmath48-body part .",
    "the indices @xmath53 and @xmath54 are omitted on both sides of the equation for simplicity .",
    "as an example we consider the @xmath55 operator ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) for nuclei in the p - shell with an s - shell core .",
    "since the spin of the core is zero , there is no core contribution for @xmath57 .",
    "so the first term in the vce , given by eq.([opexp ] ) , vanishes .",
    "taking @xmath58 , we find , that the two - body vce approximation ( _ i.e. _ , when @xmath59 ) is exact : @xmath60 where the one - body part , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath61 , is determined in terms of the proton and neutron one - body matrix elements for the p - shell from the ncsm calculations for @xmath4li and @xmath4he , respectively . to emphasize that @xmath61 is an one - body operator in the p - shell space ,",
    "we can represent it in the second - quantization formalism , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath62 where the summation runs over all single - particle states considered ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) , @xmath65 is the matrix element for these states and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) is a single - particle creation ( annihilation ) operator .",
    "then the two - body part of the effective operator is calculated by @xmath68    again , to emphasize its two - body nature , we represent it in the second - quantization form : @xmath69 where the one - body operator , @xmath61 , is given by eq.([opv1sq1b ] ) . utilizing the approach outlined in @xcite , we have calculated the effective p - shell hamiltonians for @xmath5li using the 6-body hamiltonians with @xmath70 and @xmath71 mev constructed from the cd - bonn potential @xcite . to perform ncsm calculations",
    "we have used the specialized version of the shell - model code antoine @xcite , adapted for the ncsm @xcite .",
    "the corresponding excitation energies of p - shell dominated states and the binding energy of @xmath5li are shown in fig.[spectra6li20hwcdb ] , as a function of @xmath6 .    using the obtained wave functions for different values of @xmath6",
    ", we have calculated the e2 matrix elements @xmath72 .",
    "we have used the following relation , @xmath73 between the oscillator length parameter b ( measured in fm ) and harmonic oscillator frequency @xmath74 ( measured in mev ) .",
    "then , using eq.([op2 ] ) , we have determined the matrix elements of the effective operator @xmath75 , which are listed in the last column of table [ 2body - e2 ] for @xmath76 .",
    ".[2body - e2 ] the values of reduced tbmes of the one - body bare , one- and two - body effective e2 operators for @xmath5li are shown in columns 7,8 and 9 , respectively .",
    "the values of the total reduced tbmes , @xmath77 are given in the last column .",
    "these results correspond to @xmath76 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the results presented in table iii indicate that the extrapolated theory gives a reasonable estimate of the available experimental data , taking into account that theoretical nnn forces have not been included in this study .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : e2_313_a6_nmax012 ] we show the one- and two - body contributions to the matrix element of the isovector transition @xmath78 as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "note that in this case the two - body contribution is relatively small and that the total matrix element renormalizes very weakly as the model space increases .",
    "therefore , we can see an indication that isovector transitions are not strongly - dependent on higher - body correlations .",
    "such behavior for the isovector transitions has been noted before by the authors in @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole moment of @xmath5li is notoriously difficult to calculate in the shell - model approach .",
    "we will now present some insight as to why that may be the case . in fig .",
    "[ fig : q11_a6_nmax012 ] we show the one- and two - body components of the quadrupole moment as a function of increasing model space size",
    ". one can immediately draw the interesting conclusion that the one- and two - body contributions are similar in size , yet have opposite signs relative to each other .",
    "the two contributions , thus , tend to cancel each other to give a small resultant quadrupole moment .",
    "the calculation in the @xmath79 space yields a quadrupole moment @xmath80=-0.02971$]e @xmath81 .",
    "we were also able to calculate the quadrupole moment in the larger , @xmath82 space , where the dimension of the model space exceeds 805 million .",
    "the obtained value , @xmath83=-0.02969 \\:$]e@xmath81 , is very close to the one for the @xmath79 space .",
    "note that even in the largest model space ( 16 @xmath74 ) calculation , our calculated quadrupole moment , @xmath83=-0.02969 \\:$]e @xmath81 , is about a factor of 2.5 times too small , when compared to the experimentally measured value of @xmath84= -0.0818 \\:$]e@xmath81 @xcite .",
    "however , the ncsm calculation with the cd - bonn potential for @xmath85 mev in the @xmath79 space results in @xmath80=-0.04939$]e@xmath81 .",
    "the ncsm results in the same @xmath79 space with the same frequency , @xmath85 mev , but with the n3lo interaction @xcite yield a slightly different value , -0.06 e@xmath81 . again , our goal here is not to reproduce experiment , but to understand the physics of how other physical operators , such as the @xmath55 operator , are renormalized due to truncation of the model space . in the above case , we conclude that the small quadrupole moment for @xmath5li comes from an almost total cancellation between the one- and two - body contributions , arising from the many - body correlations in the five- and six - body clusters , respectively .",
    "li ( @xmath86 ) is shown in terms of one- and two - body contributions as a function of increasing model space size .",
    "the one- and two - body contributions and total quadrupole moment are depicted as white , grey and black histograms , respectively .",
    "the experimentally measured quadrupole moment @xcite is listed on the figure for comparison . ]",
    "we now turn our attention to testing our effective @xmath55 operator represented in terms of effective charges . in order to do this",
    ", we perform a ssm calculation of @xmath55 transitions for @xmath87li and @xmath88li and compare the results to the ncsm calculations . in the ssm calculations , we use the effective @xmath55 operator created from a ncsm @xmath89 calculation specific to the two - body valence cluster approximation for each nucleus",
    ". we will refer to these effective interactions for @xmath90li as the a7(9 ) interaction , respectively .",
    "the results for @xmath87li and @xmath88li are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : li7_a7_ssm ] and [ fig : li9_a9_ssm ] , respectively .",
    "we can see in both figures that using only the one - body effective charges is not sufficient to reproduce the equivalent ncsm matrix element .",
    "the secondary effective charges add ( in general ) a small finite contribution to the ssm matrix element , thereby approximating the ncsm matrix element more accurately .",
    "this is particularly evident in @xmath88li for the @xmath91 and @xmath92 transitions and the quadrupole moment of the @xmath93 state .",
    "however , in the case of the quadrupole moment for the @xmath94 and @xmath95 states , for instance , two - body contributions modeled using secondary effective charges do not correctly approximate the two - body parts of the e2 effective operator .",
    "this indicates that exact two - body e2 matrix elements have to be used in order to obtain consistent information about interference of one- and two - body contributions .",
    "furthermore , there are higher - body correlations , which have been neglected ( _ e.g. _ the 3-body effective interaction and the 3-body effective e2 matrix elements ) .",
    "we have constructed effective e2 operators for p - shell , which account exactly for up - to 6-body correlations in the @xmath96 space .",
    "our results indicate that 3- and higher - body correlations strongly renormalize the e2 operators , enhancing the proton part by about 70@xmath97 and the neutron part by about 40@xmath97 relative to the bare proton part of the e2 operator . using 1-body valence cluster ( 1bvc ) and 2-body valence cluster ( 2bvc ) approximations",
    ", we have decomposed the effective e2 operator into one - body and two - body parts , where the effective one - body part accounts for up - to 5-body correlations in the @xmath98 space and the effective two - body for residual 6-body correlations in the @xmath96 space .",
    "we have found that the proton two - body part of the effective e2 operator constitutes on average about 17@xmath97 of the total proton renormalization , while the neutron two - body renormalization is about 50@xmath97 of the total neutron enhancement .",
    "furthermore , we noted that the renormalization for the one - body nondiagonal matrix element , @xmath99 , is about 20@xmath97 stronger than for the diagonal one , @xmath100 .",
    "we have shown that the two - body part of the effective e2 operator can be accounted for reasonably well by introducing secondary effective quadrupole charges .",
    "this approximation can be used when the e2 matrix elements are on the scale of  1.0 e@xmath81 . however , for small matrix elements ( @xmath1010.2 e@xmath81 ) the effective two - body part has to be calculated exactly to reproduce the considerable two - body effects .",
    "the best illustration of this effect is the case of the @xmath5li ground state , when one - body and two - body contributions interfere destructively , resulting in a nearly vanishing quadrupole moment .",
    "we have also shown that our effective e2 operators can be used to approximately calculate the quadrupole moment and e2 transitions for heavier nuclei in the ssm formalism ( see for , e.g. , fig.([fig : li7_a7_ssm ] ) and fig.([fig : li9_a9_ssm ] ) ) .",
    "such calculations are useful in predicting what a ncsm calculation for the e2 operator would yield , provided it could be carried out on a sufficiently large computer .",
    "recall that near the center of a major shell , such as the p - shell , the number of basis states involved in performing a converged ncsm calculation would be computationally expensive",
    ". however , as we have shown , a ssm calculation is easily performed and gives a good estimate of what the ncsm result for the e2 operator would be .",
