    "a few years after the introduction by e. wigner@xcite of the gaussian ensemble of hermitean random matrices as a basis of a statistical theory of spectra of complex many - body systems , ginibre investigated properties of the gaussian matrices when the hermitian condition is removed@xcite .",
    "the hermitian ones have found applications@xcite , especially since the link with the characterization of the manifestation of chaos in quantum mechanics has been established@xcite .",
    "more recently , the nonhermitian class has attracted great interest@xcite .",
    "the interpolation between universality classes of matrices is a standard subject of investigation in random matrix theories@xcite .",
    "the wigner - ginibre transition , which is our present object of study , has already been matter of investigation .",
    "it has been established that asymptotically , its density of eigenvalues , starting from wigner s semi - circle law distribution on the real axis , evolves as the transition proceeds through an elliptic shape , ending up in an uniform circular distribution at the ginibre situation@xcite . in addition , an asymptotic weak non - hermiticity regime@xcite with important applications to quantum open systems@xcite has been found in the intermediate regime of transition .    from the physical point of view , this transition can be seen as the passage of a gas from a 1d configuration to an isotropic 2d configuration . in fact , it is well known that the positions of eigenvalues of gaussian ensembles can be considered as those of charges of a coulomb gas .",
    "it also has been recognized that the real eigenvalues of the hermitian matrices have properties of a 1d gas of bosons , the so - called girardeau gas@xcite . on the other hand , the joint distribution of the complex eigenvalues of the complete non - hermitian matrices ,",
    "that is , the ginibre matrices have the same structure of the laughlin wave function of a 2d gas@xcite .",
    "the behavior of individual eigenvalues of hermitian random matrices has been a matter of investigation since the pioneering works which described the distribution of largest eigenvalues , an achievement followed by several applications@xcite .",
    "recently , the order statistics problem of obtaining the distribution of all eigenvalues considered as an ordered sequence of random variables has been addressed@xcite . here",
    "we are interested in studying how that ordering on the real axis reflects on the eigenvalue trajectories in the complex plane as the hermitian condition is progressively removed and also in the final eigenvalue distribution . in other words , do the complex eigenvalues retain a memory of their initial positions on the real axis ? to do this investigation , we resort to a system of differential equations which describes the motion of the eigenvalues as a function of the parameter breaking the hermitian condition .",

    "that is @xmath24 asymptotically , that is when @xmath2 becomes large , the eigenvalues fill an ellipse@xcite whose axes for our parameterization are    @xmath25    and    @xmath26    as @xmath27 belongs to the ginibre ensemble of non - hermitian matrices , @xmath28 undergoes a transition from the wigner to the ginibre ensemble with eigenvalues moving along trajectories in the complex plane .",
    "their motion is governed by a system of differential equations which can be deduced in the following way@xcite .",
    "the matrices @xmath28 are diagonalized by the similarity transformation    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal contains the complex eigenvalues while @xmath31 is a matrix of size @xmath2 which contains the eigenvectors . on the hand , the adjoint of eq .",

    "the above equations together with the initial conditions provided by the hermitian matrix @xmath18 form a complete system of first order differential equations which numerically can be solved to obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors along the transition .",
    "insofar as the dependence of @xmath12 with the parameter @xmath10 has not been specified , this set of differential equations is general . assuming this dependence to be given by ( [ 2 ] ) , the second derivative @xmath47 vanishes due to the linear dependence with @xmath10 and , explicitly , eq .",

    "we find that the eigenvalues leave the real axis at @xmath17 perpendicularly .",
    "we observe that integrating these equations between the initial value @xmath17 and some final value @xmath56 is equivalent to diagonalize @xmath28 at each intermediate value of @xmath34 this is illustrated in fig . 1 ,",
    "in which @xmath57 eigenvalue trajectories obtained performing the integration from @xmath17 to @xmath58 the equations of motion are compared with the result of diagonalizing the matrices at several intermediate values of @xmath34 the agreement is perfect showing that the above system is reliable and amenable to numerical integration .    fig .",
    "1 also shows that eigenvalues may have complicated trajectories in the complex plane .",
    "therefore , in order to reveal structures the trajectories may have , it is necessary to accumulate results of many simulations , that is to construct an ensemble .",
    "this is done in fig . 2 in",
    "which trajectories were obtained by evolving eigenvalues of 60 different initial hermitian matrices , clearly exhibiting a structure .",
    "indeed , trajectories starting on the real axis at the edge , cover regions of a meniscus shape whose curvature decreases as eigenvalues more to the center are considered .",
    "trajectories starting at the central region of the initial spectrum move inside strips .",
    "the presence of these strips is better seen in fig .",
    "3 where points correspond to eigenvalues at the end of the transition , that is for @xmath59 the structure of the distribution of points show that , statistically , eigenvalues preserve to some extent the relative positions they had on the real axis .",
    "in conclusion , evolving under the action of the external confining harmonic potential and the repulsion force among them , eigenvalues present structures in their trajectories and in their final distribution in the complex plane which reflect the ordering they have on the real axis .",
    "we remark that the present study can be considered as an instance of the so - called parametric statistics used to characterize the evolution of individual eigenvalues as a function of an external parameter@xcite . in the case of complex eigenvalues ,",
    "parametric evolution has been experimentally investigated by considering resonances trapped in an open microwave cavity in which the slit width can be varied@xcite .",
