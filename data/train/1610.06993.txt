    "since the late 1960s , projection methods [ 13 ] have been widely used for the numerical simulations of transient incompressible navier - stokes equations in extensive scientific areas [ 4 , 5 ] and industrial fields [ 6 , 7 ] . the high popularity of these methods is due to the scheme s abilities to execute the incompressibility constrains using a set of two decoupled elliptic equations : a nonlinear advection - diffusion equation , and subsequently , a linear pressure poisson equation .",
    "although each of the cascade equations imposes computational costs to the system , poisson s equation tends to be the most time - consuming component of the flow simulation in complex geometries [ 8 ] as well as in computations with open boundary conditions [ 6 , 9 ] .    to substantially lessen the computational expenses , a common approach is to design robust multigrid ( mg ) solvers , which are solely devoted to one of the existing elliptic systems ( see e.g. , refs . [ 1012 ] for mg solvers for the advection - diffusion equation , and refs .",
    "[ 13 , 14 ] for those associated with poisson s equation ) .",
    "in contrast with the methods cited above , a novel family of multigrid procedures , the so - called coarse grid projection ( cgp ) methodology by the authors [ 1518 ] , involves both the nonlinear and linear equations to efficiently accelerate the computations . in the cgp methodology , the nonlinear momentum is balanced on a fine grid , and the linear poisson s equation is performed on a corresponding coarsened grid .",
    "mapping functions carry out data transfer between the velocity and pressure fields . in this sense ,",
    "the cgp methods not only effectively relieve the stiff behavior of the primary poisson problem , but can also take advantage of any desired fast elliptic solver to achieve large speedups while maintaining excellent to reasonable accuracy .",
    "the cgp methodology is provided in detail in sect .",
    "the cgp framework was originally proposed by lentine et al . in 2010",
    "[ 15 ] for visual simulations of inviscid flows for video game applications .",
    "the uniform grid finite - volume and explicit forward euler methods were chosen , respectively , for spatial and temporal discretizations in their numerical simulations .",
    "this gridding format led to dealing with a volume - weighted poisson equation [ 19 ] in the presence of a solid object ( e.g. , a sphere ) inside the flow field . aside from the added complication",
    ", the grid format would have caused considerable reductions in visual fidelities , if the authors had not employed the complex mapping operators that they did .",
    "this makes the cgp technique less practical for curved boundaries .",
    "furthermore , the explicit time integration restricted their algorithm to low cfl ( courant - friedrichs - lewy ) numbers , and therefore long run times . in 2014",
    "jin and chen [ 18 ] implemented the same cgp scheme [ 15 ] in the fast fluid dynamics ( ffd ) models to calibrate the effect of this computational accelerator tool on simulating building airflows . a decrease in spurious fluctuations of ventilation rates",
    "was observed , but the maximum achieved speedup was only a factor of approximately 1.50 .    in 2013",
    "san and staples [ 16 ] expanded the cgp technique ( labeled `` cgprk3 '' ) to the vorticity - stream function formulation of the incompressible navier - stokes equations and demonstrated speedup factors ranging from approximately 2 to 42 in their numerical studies .",
    "additionally , they extended the method in order to dramatically lower computational costs associated with elliptic equations of potential vorticity in quasigeostrophic ocean models [ 17 ] . notwithstanding these successes , the cgprk3 strategy has four main shortcomings .",
    "first , the nine - term full weighting restriction [ 20 ] and bilinear prolongation [ 20 ] operators used can be exclusively utilized in equally spaced grids .",
    "consequently , one must analytically reformulate all steps according to generalized curvilinear coordinates except in uniform rectangular domains .",
    "second , cgprk3 applies the third - order runge - kutta [ 21 ] temporal integration to the non - incremental pressure correction method [ 1 ] , while the splitting error of this specific projection scheme is irreducibly first - order in time and higher - order temporal integration methods do not improve the overall accuracy [ 1 ] .",
    "third , the third - order time stepping scheme unnecessarily forces the cgprk3 scheme to run the poisson solver three times at each time step , whereas the primary goal of cgp is to reduce the computational effort that arises from the poisson equation .",
    "fourth , their suggested mapping procedure becomes more costly than that of the poisson equation solver for high coarsening levels .    to obviate the aforementioned problems , a semi - implicit - time - integration finite - element version of the cgp method ( ife - cgp )",
    "is presented in the current study .",
    "the incorporation of a semi - implicit backward time integration results in a simple five - step cgp algorithm with nearly zero cost for the data restriction /prolongation operators .",
    "it typically enables flow simulations at large time steps and thus improves speedup [ 22 ] .",
    "the triangular finite element meshes improve the cgp method in the following ways .",
    "first , they enhance the scheme s capacity for the solution of fluid problems defined on complicated domains , where irregular grids and realistic boundary conditions are unavoidable .",
    "second , they facilitate the design of the required mapping modules so that the restriction / prolongation operators can be optionally equivalent to the shape functions approximating multilevel nested spaces of velocity and pressure fields .",
    "third , the generation of the laplacian and divergence operators on a coarsened grid is expedited by means of available geometric / algebraic multigrid ( gmg / amg ) tools for the finite element method ( see e.g. , [ 2326 ] ) .",
    "this feature is particularly important for obtaining a sufficiently accurate solution of poisson s equation in modeling flow over obstacles .",
    "this article s objective is to present a simple , elegant version of the cgp method for finite element discretizations of incompressible fluid flow problems . as accelerating incompressible flow computations",
    "is the major application of cgp , speedup rates of the computations and the corresponding reduction in the accuracy of velocity and pressure fields are calculated . besides this main application",
    ", we explore mesh refinement usages of the cgp method for the first time . as a next concern , because the accuracy of the pressure field in projection methods suffers from the negative influence of artificial homogeneous dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions on formations of boundary layers [ 6 , 9 ] , the possibility of thickening the layers by the cgp prolongation operator is investigated .",
    "lastly , because the cgp procedure reduces the degree of freedom for the pressure component , a greater reduction in the integrity of the pressure field appears in comparison with the velocity field [ 16 ] . on the other hand , the pressure gradient ( instead of simply pressure )",
    "is applied to a velocity correction step of pressure projection schemes [ 27 ] . with these two hypotheses in mind",
    ", we examine the effect of the cgp process on variations of both the pressure and its gradient .",
    "all the above mentioned numerical challenges are investigated through several representative benchmark problems : the taylor - green vortex in a non - trivial geometry , flow over a backward - facing step , and finally flow past a circular cylinder .",
    "this article structured as follows .",
    "2.1 provides the governing equations for incompressible viscous flows and their finite element formulations .",

    "the procedure yields two elliptic problems along with one correction equation , expressed as    @xmath24 -\\mu \\delta \\textbf{\\textit{\\~u}}^{n+1}=\\textbf{\\textit{f}}^{n+1 } \\textrm { in } v,\\ ] ]    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    notice that the poisson equation is restricted to unrealistic homogenous neumann boundary conditions , when the velocity is subject to dirichlet types .",
    "contrarily , natural neumann conditions for the momentum equation result in boundaries with spurious homogenous dirichlet pressures .",

    "( 1)(2 ) , the discrete brezzi - babuska condition [ 31 , 32 ] can be ignored [ 27 ] and therefore the degree of the polynomials over the triangular mesh elements is chosen to be equal for the velocity and pressure .",
    "in addition , the identical resolutions allow the comparison of computational effectiveness between the current approach and that described in previous works [ 1518 ] .",
    "the cgp methodology provides a multiresolution framework for accelerating pressure - correction technique computations by performing part of the computations on a coarsened grid .",
    "alternatively , cgp can be thought as a guide to mesh refinement for pressure - correction schemes .",
    "figure 1 gives a schematic illustration of the ife - cgp algorithm for triangular finite element meshes .",
    "as shown in fig . 1",
    ", at each time step @xmath20 , the intermediate velocity field data @xmath38 obtained on a fine grid is restricted to a coarsened grid .",
    "the divergence of @xmath39 , the intermediate velocity field data on the coarsened grid , plays the role of the source term in solving the poisson equation on the coarse grid to detrimine the pressure p@xmath39 on the coarse grid ; then , the resulting pressure data p@xmath39 is prolonged to the fine grid and becomes of p@xmath38 .",
    "either gmg or amg techniques are key numerical tools to conveniently formulate the grid transfer , laplacian , and divergence operators in the ife - cgp algorithm . in the present work ,",
    "gmg methods are used , because using amg methods in the derivation of the divergence operator is challenging for anisotropic triangular grids [ 33 ] . here",
    "we generate hierarchical meshes in which each triangular element of a coarse mesh is conformingly subdivided into four new triangles . as a consequence ,",
    "if the available finest mesh ( with @xmath40-element resolution ) is generated after @xmath41 refinement levels , a relatively coarse mesh ( with a resolution of @xmath42 elements ) and its basis functions are available .",
    "generally , one can obtain the corresponding coarsened grid using the space decomposition algorithm discussed for nonuniform triangular grids in the literature ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "[ 34 , 35 ] ) .    in principle",
    ", there can be an arbitrary number , @xmath43 , of nested spaces of progressively coarsened grids such that : @xmath44 . in practice , however , reasonable levels of accuracy can only be obtained for a maximum of three levels of coarsening .",
    "we restrict our attention to such cases .",
    "consider a sequence of four nested spaces , @xmath45 , wherein if @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) corresponds to a fine grid , @xmath48 characterizes the space of the next coarsest grid .",
    "recall that for any arbitrary @xmath49 element on @xmath48 , there is a piecewise linear shape function @xmath50 that is capable of estimating the space of the four sub - elements over @xmath46 .",
    "with this in mind , linear interpolation is implemented to construct the prolongation operator @xmath51 and its matrix representation * * p**@xmath52 .",
    "mathematically , the transpose of the prolongation operator is a feasible option for the definition of the restriction operator @xmath53 [ 26 ] . in spite of this fact ,",
    "the restriction matrix @xmath54 is designed so that fine data of @xmath55 is directly injected throughout the coarse grid @xmath56 only if the data belongs to a common node between the two spaces ; otherwise , it can not be accessed by the coarse grid . unlike @xmath57 , @xmath54 is able to directly connect two non - nested spaces .",
    "it is worth noting that the cgp method is compatible with other advanced data interpolation / extrapolation architectures ( see e.g. , [ 36 ] ) ; however , even the simple mapping techniques introduced here are adequate .    in the gmg method used , a relatively coarse mesh , @xmath56 , with @xmath58 as a basis is directly accessible . hence , the relevant laplacian ( @xmath59 ) and divergence ( @xmath60 ) operators are derived by taking the inner products of a coarse - grid finite element shape function @xmath61 on @xmath56 .",

    "figures 15a15d compare the cpu times consumed by various components of the processing segment for four test cases using different boundary conditions .",
    "the taylor - green vortex , flow over a backward - facing step , and flow past a cylinder are modeled by the ife - cgp approach , while the double shear layer problem is simulated by the cgprk3 technique [ 16 ] . regarding the ife - cgp strategy , by the coarsening level increment , the poisson equation price lessens dramatically so that its portion becomes less than 5% after just one level of coarsening .",
    "for that reason , a considerable speedup can not be achieved after @xmath163 .",
    "a similar trend occurs in application of the cgprk3 method with the difference that the major reduction in the poisson solver cost is obtained at @xmath147 .",
    "the significant difference between the ife - cgp and cgprk3 algorithms is associated with the computational expense of the data transfer between the advection - diffusion and the poisson grids . according to fig .",
    "15d , the cgprk3 method allocates more cpu resources to mapping the data for each subsequent level of coarsening , and finally the mapping process costs overcome the poisson equation costs at @xmath147 .",
    "in contrast , this charge never exceeds 0.004% of the total algorithm computational cost using the ife - cgp strategy .        concerning influences of the boundary condition ,",
    "the maximum speedup is achieved when the outflow velocity in the backward - facing step problem is treated as a stress - free condition , and the lowest acceleration of the computations is observed when velocity dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced for the taylor - green vortex simulation .",
    "the speedups when using periodic boundary conditions are in between these two extremes .",
    "this difference is expected because solving a poisson equation with spurious homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions requires more computational effort in comparison with pressure neumann conditions [ 56 ] . in terms of the accuracy level",
    ", the cgp class of methods retains the velocity field data close to that of full fine grid resolution simulations in the presence of less restrictive velocity boundary conditions , such as open and periodic ones .",
    "however , the cgp approach with pure velocity dirichlet conditions results in a dampened velocity field , which has been also reported by lentine et al . [ 15 ] . in the case of euler s equations , where the viscous term is neglected and the flow is allowed to slip on the solid surfaces , the cgp method acquires much less damped flows . for the same reason ,",
    "the damping phenomenon disappears when the cgp solver is run at high reynolds numbers .",
    "the cgp method is a new multigrid technique applicable to pressure projection methods for solving the incompressible navier - stokes equations . in the cgp approach ,",
    "the nonlinear momentum equation is evolved on a fine grid , and the linear pressure poisson equation is solved on a corresponding coarsened grid .",
    "mapping operators transfer the data between the grids .",
    "hence , one can save a considerable amount of cpu time due to reducing the resolution of the pressure filed while maintaining excellent to reasonable accuracy , depending on the level of coarsening .    in this article",
    ", we proposed a semi - implicit - time - integration finite - element version of the cgp ( ife - cgp ) .",
    "the newly added semi - implicit time integration feature enabled cgp to run simulations with large time steps , and thus further accelerated the computations compared to the standard / previous cgp algorithms .",
    "the new data structure introduced resulted in nearly zero computational cost for the mapping procedures . using the finite element discretization ,",
    "cgp was adapted to be suitable for complex geometries and realistic boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , the mapping functions were conveniently derived from the finite element shape functions .    in order to examine the efficiency of the ife - cgp method , we solved three standard test cases : the taylor - green vortex in a non - trivial geometry , flow over a backward - facing step , and flow past a circular cylinder .",
    "the speedup factors ranged from 1.601 to 29.534 .",
    "the minimum speedup belonged to the taylor - green vortex problem with velocity dirichlet boundary conditions , while the maximum speedup was found for the flow over a backward - facing step with open boundary conditions .",
    "generally , the outputs for one and two levels of the poisson grid coarsening agreed well with those computed using full fine scale computations . for three levels of coarsening , however , only a reasonable level of accuracy was achieved .",
    "the mesh refinement application of the cgp method was introduced for the first time in this work .",
    "based on it , if for a given spatial resolution the numerical simulation diverged or the velocity outputs were not accurate enough , instead of refining both the advection - diffusion and the poisson grids , the ife - cgp mesh refinement suggests to only refine the advection - diffusion grid and keep the poisson grid resolution unchanged .",
    "the application of the novel mesh refinement tool was shown in the cases of flow over a backward - facing step and flow past a cylinder .",
    "for the backward facing step flow , a three - level partial mesh refinement made a previously diverging computation numerically stable .",
    "for the flow past a cylinder , the error of the viscous lift force was reduced from 31.501% to 7.191% ( with reference to the standard mesh refinement results ) by the one - level partial mesh refinement technique .",
    "we showed that the prolongation operator of ife - cgp did not thicken the artificial layers that arose from the artificial neumann boundary conditions .",
    "additionally , we demonstrated that although cgp reduces the accuracy level of the pressure field , it conserves the accuracy of the pressure gradient , a key to the efficacy of the cgp method .    for future studies , the contribution of different incremental pressure projection schemes ( such as standard [ 44 ] , rotational [ 27 ] , and vectorial forms [ 45 ] ) to the cgp methodology will be analyzed .",
    "it is conjectured that because the above mentioned methods diminish the errors introduced by spurious neumann conditions , applying a cgp technique to the incremental projection methods can lead to undamped flows in comparison with applying the cgp strategy to non - incremental pressure correction computations .",
    "another objective of our future research is to perform a comparison between the cgp approach with one level of coarsening ( @xmath136 ) and the standard finite element algorithm with taylor - hood mixed finite elements ( * * p**@xmath199/**p**@xmath31 ) ( see e.g. , refs . [ 1 , 6 ] ) . from a grid resolution point of view , for an assumed number of grid points of the velocity component , the poisson solver utilizes a space with an equal pressure node numbers , discretized using either the ife - cgp ( @xmath136 ) method or taylor - hood elements . in this sense , a detailed investigation of the similarity / difference between these two concepts may introduce novel mapping functions for the ife - cgp tool .",
