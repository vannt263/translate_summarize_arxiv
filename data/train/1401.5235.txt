    "the nature of the soft x - ray excess ( i.e. emission in soft x - rays in excess of the extrapolation of the hard power law component ) has been a matter of debate since its discovery ( singh et al . 1985 ; arnaud et al .",
    "the first proposed explanation , pure thermal disk emission , is ruled out by the high temperature implied ( about 0.1 - 0.2 kev ) and by its constancy over a wide range of black hole masses ( gierlinski & done 2004 ) .",
    "a great leap forward in our understanding of the soft x - ray emission was the realization that reflection of the primary x - ray emission from the accretion disk can explain this excess if the disk is at least moderately ionized ( e.g. ross & fabian 1993 ; crummy et al .",
    "2006 ; walton et al .",
    "2013 ) . however , there are cases in which even reflection may not be sufficient ( lohfink et al . 2012 )    ark 120 ( a.k.a .",
    "mrk 1095 , @xmath3=0.0327 ) is an object where the soft x - ray emission is prominent ( vaughan et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it is a broad line ( h@xmath4 fwhm of 5800 km s@xmath5 , wandel et al .",
    "1999 ) seyfert 1 galaxy , with an estimated black hole mass of 1.5@xmath610@xmath7  m@xmath8 ( peterson et al .",
    "it has been observed extensively in x - rays ( see nardini et al .",
    "2011 and references therein ) , always showing a strong soft excess and never showing a warm absorber - it is indeed often referred to as a ` bare ' seyfert 1 .",
    "nardini et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , analysing the 2007 @xmath9 observation , found clear evidence for a relativistic iron line , which was not clearly detected in the 2003 xmm-@xmath0 observation ( vaughan et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "in this paper we report on simultaneous xmm-@xmath0 and @xmath1 observations of ark 120 which demonstrate the importance of broad band observations to understand the soft excess in agn .",
    "the xmm-@xmath0 observation of ark 120 analysed in this paper started on 2013 february 18 with the epic ccd cameras , the pn and the two mos operated in small window and medium filter , and the rgs cameras .",
    "source extraction radii and screening for intervals of flaring particle background were performed with sas 12.0.1 via an iterative process maximizing the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) ( see piconcelli et al .",
    "2004 ) . after this process ,",
    "the net exposure time was of about 80 ks for the pn , adopting an extraction radius of 40 arcsec and patterns 0 to 4 .",
    "the pn background spectrum was extracted from a source - free circular region with a radius of 50 arcsec .",
    "spectra were binned in order to over - sample the instrumental resolution by at least a factor of 3 and to have no less than 30 counts in each background - subtracted spectral channel .",
    "this allows the applicability of @xmath10 statistics .",
    "the rgs spectra were reduced following the guidelines in guainazzi & bianchi ( 2007 ) .",
    "the net exposure times are about 130 ks for rgs1 and rgs2 .",
    "@xmath1 ( harrison et al . 2013 ) observed ark 120 simultaneously with xmm-@xmath0 with its two coaligned telescopes containing focal plane modules a and b ( fpma , fpmb ) .",
    "the level 1 data products were processed with the @xmath1 data analysis software ( nustardas ) package ( v. 1.1.1 ) .",
    "event files ( level 2 data products ) were produced , calibrated , and cleaned using standard filtering criteria with the nupipeline task and the latest calibration files available in the @xmath1 calibration database ( caldb ) .",
    "extraction radii for both the source and background spectra were 1.5 arcmin .",
    "spectra were binned in order to over - sample the instrumental resolution by at least a factor of 2.5 and to have a s / n ratio greater than 5 in each spectral channel .",
    "the net exposure times are about 80 ks for both fpma and fpmb .    in the following",
    ", spectra are analysed with xspec v12.8.0 .",
    "all errors correspond to 90% confidence levels for one parameter of interest .",
    "when performing joint xmm-@xmath0 and @xmath1 fits we introduced a multiplicative factor to account for differences in the absolute flux calibrations . fixing this factor to 1 for the pn , it is about 1.06 for fpma and 1.07 for fpmb ( slightly depending on the model ) .",
    "similar values are found in other agn observed simultaneously by xmm-@xmath0 and @xmath1 ( brenneman et al .",
    "2014 , marinucci et al .",
    "2014a , b ) .",
    "observation ( epic - pn ) .",
    "the [ 0.6 - 2 kev]/[0.3 - 0.6 kev ] and [ 2 - 10 kev]/[0.6 - 2 kev ] hardness ratios are also shown ( fourth and bottom panels , respectively ) .",
    "[ hr ] ]    the xmm-@xmath0 0.3 - 0.6 kev , 0.6 - 2 kev and 2 - 10 kev light curves show flux variations of about 15% , with only a small ( less than 10% ) variation in the hardness ratios .",
    "similar flux variations , and no spectral variability , is found in the @xmath1 data .",
    "therefore , for both satellites we used the spectra integrated over the entire observations and fitted them together .",
    "first , however , we fitted the two datasets independently .",
    "a good fit to the 3 - 79 kev @xmath1 spectrum is found with a relatively simple model : a power law with a high energy cutoff ( @xmath11=1.79@xmath120.03 , @xmath13340 kev ) , a cold reflection model ( pexrav in xspec ; @xmath14=0.26@xmath15 ) , and two narrow iron lines ( energies of 6.41@xmath16 kev and 6.91@xmath15 kev ) .",
    "the @xmath10 is 343.0 for 343 d.o.f .",
    "( @xmath17=1 )",
    ". then the xmm-@xmath0 spectrum was added , to show the presence of a strong soft excess below 2 kev ( fig .",
    "[ badfit_nustar ] ) .",
    "then , we fitted the xmm-@xmath0/epic - pn spectrum alone in the 0.3 - 10 kev band ( ignoring the 1.8 - 2.5 kev band to exclude the instrumental features present there ) . for simplicity , we used the epic - pn detector only .",
    "we used a model composed of a power law absorbed by both the galactic column ( @xmath18=9.78@xmath610@xmath19 @xmath20 , kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) and an intrinsic absorber ( which , however , in all fits is found to be very small or negligible ) , neutral and ionized reflection components ( xillver in xspec , garcia et al .",
    "2013 ) , and iron emission lines in addition to those present in the reflection models to account for further features present in the 6.4 - 7 kev region ( see fig .",
    "[ ironline ] ) .",
    "a single reflector is clearly insufficient to fit the spectrum ( @xmath17/d.o.f.=8.51/150 and 3.38/147 for an unblurred and a relativistically blurred reflector , respectively ) , and even with two unblurred plus two relativistically blurred reflection components the fit is unacceptable ( @xmath17/d.o.f.=2.45/141 ) , clearly requiring a further component to model the soft x - ray emission .",
    "the inclusion of a black body emission component improves the fit significantly ( @xmath17/d.o.f.=1.54/139 ) , but the temperature found is quite large for an agn ( about 0.1 kev , while for a standard optically thick , geometrically thin disc the maximum temperature appropriate for the black hole mass of ark 120 is about 10 - 20 ev , frank et al .",
    "a multicolour black body model ( diskbb model in xspec ) results in a fit of similar quality ( @xmath17/d.o.f.=1.52/139 ) .",
    "a better fit is found substituting the black body component with a second , steep power law ( @xmath212.4 , @xmath17/d.o.f.=1.43/139 ) , even if at the expense of a very flat hard power law ( @xmath221.2 ) .",
    "a significantly better fit ( @xmath17/d.o.f.=1.29/145 ) is found with a cutoff power for the soft excess plus the primary power law , two unblurred reflection components and the two narrow lines ; the addition of a blurred reflection component does not improve the fit quality .",
    "even if the @xmath10 for these fits is not ideal , an inspection of the residuals shows that there are no obvious features left ; most of the remaining problems are related to a still imperfect fitting of the iron line region .",
    "because we are interested here mainly in the soft x - ray emission , we decided to accept these fits .",
    "a detailed discussion of the reflection and line features is deferred to a future paper , that we plan to write after the public release of an improved energy scale calibration affecting recent epic - pn observations ( see discussion in marinucci et al .",
    "here we just remark that the use of a different reflection model , namely the reflionx model in xspec ( ross & fabian 2005 ) , gives similar parameters and does not significantly affect the results on the soft excess .",
    "no ionized absorption is apparent , either in the epic or in the rgs data , confirming the ` bare ' seyfert 1 nature of ark  120 .",
    "the observed 0.5 - 2 kev and 2 - 10 kev fluxes are 1.4@xmath610@xmath23 erg @xmath20 s@xmath5 and 2.3@xmath610@xmath23 erg @xmath20 s@xmath5 , respectively , corresponding to absorption - corrected luminosities in the same bands of 3.4@xmath610@xmath24 erg s@xmath5 and 5.6@xmath610@xmath24 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the source is about 1.4 times fainter than in the 2007 @xmath9 observation , and 1.8 times fainter than in the 2003 xmm-@xmath0 observation .    even if ark 120 is a radio - quiet source , it is not radio - silent , so we also tried the srcut model in xspec , which describes the synchrotron spectrum from an exponentially cut off power law distribution of electrons in a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "the spectrum is similar to a cutoff power law , but with a rollover slower than exponential . a good fit ( @xmath17/d.o.f.=1.31/145 ) is found .",
    "one of the model s parameters is the 1 ghz flux , which is well below the observed 1.4 ghz value ( e.g. condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , but this is because the best fit power law index is almost zero . if the radio index observed for this source , 0.6 ( barvainis et al . 1996 ) , is adopted , the fit is significantly worse ( @xmath17/d.o.f.=1.57/146 ) and the 1.4 ghz flux is almost 3 orders of magnitude larger than observed .    a decent fit ( @xmath17/d.o.f.=1.46/146 ) is found with a thermal bremsstrahlung model instead of the cutoff power law .",
    "however , assuming that the emitting region is optically thin to thomson scattering , a lower limit to the size of the emitting region of about 0.1 pc is found , inconsistent with the observed x - ray variability below 0.6 kev , where the soft excess component dominates .    to summarize , from the xmm-@xmath0 data alone we found that a cutoff power law for the soft x - ray excess is preferred to , e.g. , a power law , but the statistical difference is such that the latter model can not be entirely ruled out .",
    "however , the issue becomes immediately clear once we extrapolate ( without refitting ) the xmm-@xmath0 best fit models to the @xmath1 band ( see fig .",
    "[ powextr ] ) : the power law model completely fails to fit the @xmath1 spectra .",
    "this result is confirmed by the joint xmm-@xmath0/@xmath1 analysis .",
    "the cutoff power law modeling of the soft x - ray emission ( i.e. the refitting of the model presented in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ powextr ] ) provides by far the best fit ( @xmath17/d.o.f.=1.14/494 , see also fig .",
    "[ bestfit ] ) while the next best fit , that with a black body , has @xmath17/d.o.f.=1.36/488 .    very similar quality of fits are found using , for the soft excess , comptonization models instead of a cutoff power law ( e.g. comptt , nthcomp or optxagn in xspec ) .",
    "all these models give very similar values for the temperature and optical depth of the comptonizing slab .",
    "we discuss here in some detail the optxagnf model ( done et al .",
    "2012 ) . in this model",
    "the gravitational energy released in the disc at each radius is emitted as a ( colour temperature corrected ) blackbody only down to a given radius , the coronal radius @xmath25 .",
    "below this radius , it is assumed that the energy can no longer completely thermalize , and is distributed between a low energy and a high energy electron population , giving rise to a soft and a hard comptonization components .",
    "even if some of the model assumptions ( e.g. the sharp edge between the thermalization and scattering regions , the geometrical coincidence of the two scattering zones , the maximum disk temperature fixed to that at the coronal radius ) are certainly oversimplified , it has the merit of connecting the uv and soft x - ray emission .",
    "input parameters of the model are the black hole mass and the distance of the source ( which we kept fixed to the values mentioned in the introduction ) , the black hole spin , the bolometric eddington ratio @xmath26 , @xmath25 , the electron temperature and optical depth of the low energy electron population , the power law index of the high energy emission and the fraction , @xmath27 , of the power below the coronal radius which is emitted in the hard comptonization component . because in optxagn the hard component is parametrized as a power law with a cutoff energy of 100 kev , we first estimated @xmath28 using xmm-@xmath0 data alone and then switched off the hard component , substituting it with a cutoff power law .",
    "the spin could not be constrained , so we initially fixed it to zero .",
    "the reduced @xmath10 is 1.14 for 493 d.o.f .. the best fit parameters are listed in table  [ optxagn ] while the best fit model ( without galactic absorption for clarity ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ bestfitmodel ] . besides optxagn and the cutoff power law ,",
    "the model is composed of two reflection components and two gaussian iron lines .",
    "though a detailed discussion of the reflection and line emission is deferred to a future paper , we can say here that the best fit is obtained with two reflection components with ionization parameters of @xmath250 ( the brightest ) and @xmath21000 erg cm s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the iron abundance is @xmath23.4 .",
    "two emission lines are also needed , one at about 7 kev ( possibly related to fe xxvi ; the iron k@xmath4 line is already included in the xillver reflection model ) , with a significance of @xmath2999.99% according to an f - test , the other at about 6.55 ( corresponding to fe xxi - xxii ) , with a significance of 99.98% .",
    "we then fixed the spin to 0.5 and to 0.99 .",
    "the best fit parameters are listed in table  [ optxagn ] .",
    "it is worth noting that when we increase the spin , the larger emitting area due to the lower value of the innermost stable orbit is compensated by a lower @xmath26 ratio .",
    "the two parameters are therefore largely degenerate , and from the x - ray spectra alone it is not possible to measure the black hole spin .    to remove this degeneracy , we used the xmm-@xmath0 optical monitor data , similarly to what was done by done et al .",
    "ark 120 was observed with filters uvw1 , uvm2 and uvw2 , whose effective wavelengths are 2910 , 2310 and 2120  , respectively .",
    "the fluxes were 3.9@xmath610@xmath30 , 5.3@xmath610@xmath30 and 5.6@xmath610@xmath30 erg @xmath20 s@xmath5 @xmath5 ( with statistical errors of about 1% ) , respectively , after correction for galactic extinction ( schlafly & finkbeiner 2011 ) following seaton ( 1979 ) .",
    "contributions from the host galaxy are estimated to be less than 10% . given the uncertainties in any extinction correction and the simplifying assumptions in the model ( including the fact that it is angle - averaged , so corresponding to an inclination angle of 60 degrees ; for lesser inclination angles the flux would be higher , up to twice as much for a face - on disc ) , we did not attempt to fit the uv - x - rays sed but limited ourselves to extrapolating the best fit model and comparing it to the uv fluxes .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath31=0.99 model falls short of the uv fluxes by a factor @xmath22 - 3 , while the @xmath31=0 is larger by a factor @xmath22 .",
    "the extrapolation of the @xmath31=0.50 model , instead , is roughly consistent with the uv fluxes . while the range of @xmath26 values are rather common for bright seyfert galaxies ( e.g. steinhardt & elvis 2010 ) , it is interesting to note that the low spin solution gives a @xmath26 ratio larger than the typical values for this source ( e.g. woo & urry 2002 , peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) , an unlikely situation given that in our observation the source was in a rather low flux state .",
    "we conclude that an intermediate value for the spin is preferred .",
    "interestingly , nardini et al .",
    "( 2011 ) reached the same conclusion based on a relativistic reflection fit ( see also patrick et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    ".best fit parameters for the joint xmm-@xmath0/@xmath1 fit with the soft excess modeled by optxagnf ( done et al .",
    "2012 ) , for three different black hole spins .",
    "[ optxagn ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     because the hard x - ray emission is thought to originate from the comptonization of uv / soft x - ray photons by a population of hot electrons , we substituted the hard cutoff power law with a comptonization model .",
    "we used the compps model in xspec , assuming a spherical geometry , a maxwellian electron distribution and a black body input temperature of 20 ev .",
    "the fit is as good as the one with the cutoff power law , and the parameters are not very well determined , not surprising given that the cutoff power law model gives only a lower limit to the high energy cutoff . for @xmath31=0",
    "the electron temperature is between 110 and 210 kev , while the optical depth is between 0.6 and 1.5 .",
    "similar values are found for the other values of the spin .",
    "therefore , the electron distribution is consistent with being optically thick , which may explain the lack of evidence for relativistic reflection : if the corona is extended ( as assumed in the optxagnf model ) , reflection from the inner disk may be scattered and then unrecognizable ( e.g. petrucci et al .",
    "the 0.3 - 80 kev spectral energy range provided by the quasi - simultaneous xmm-@xmath0/@xmath1 observations of the ` bare ' seyfert 1 galaxy ark 120 has allowed us to study the soft x - ray excess in this source with unprecedented accuracy and robustness . differently from many other broad line seyfert 1s , where ionized reflection is sufficient to explain the soft x - ray emission ,",
    "a further component is required .",
    "while ark 120 may well be a peculiar source , it should also be noted that it is one of the best sources where to search for such a component given the lack of intrinsic absorption .",
    "a cutoff power law is the best phenomenological model for the excess .",
    "if interpreted as a signature of comptonization , a temperature of @xmath20.3 kev and an optical depth of @xmath213 are required .",
    "a word of caution is needed here , as such large optical depths can work efficiently in comptonizing photons only if the absorption opacity is much lower than the scattering opacity ( see discussion in done et al .",
    "2012 ) , and it is likely that the presently available comptonization model are still too simplistic , expecially in this regime . even with these limitations in mind , adopting the recently developed optxagnf model ( done et al . 2012 ) , and using the x - ray data alone , we find that some of the parameters , and in particular the black hole spin and the @xmath26 ratio , are highly degenerate , and we find no strong constraint on the black hole spin from the x - ray data alone .",
    "the extrapolation of the best fit models to the uv fluxes , however , suggests that an intermediate black hole spin solution is preferred .",
    "x - ray variability is very similar at all energies ( fig .  [ hr ] ) . in",
    "the done et al .",
    "( 2012 ) scenario , this means that what is driving variability is a change in the total power ( possibly related to changes in the accretion rate ) rather than a change in the relative fraction of power in the hard and soft components .    unlike other agn observed by @xmath1 ( e.g. ic4329a , brenneman et al . 2014 ; mcg5 - 23 - 16 , harrison et al , in prep . ;",

    "no clear evidence for relativistic reflection is found .",
    "it is interesting to note that in other sources observed simultaneously by xmm-@xmath0 and @xmath1 , where the relativistic reflection is clearly present , this component entirely accounts for the soft x - ray emission ( mcg6 - 30 - 15 , marinucci et al .",
    ", 2014b ; swift j2127.4 + 5654 , marinucci et al . , 2014a , ngc 1365 , walton et al .",
    "one possible explanation is that in ark 120 the hot corona , responsible for the hard x - ray emission , is both optically thick and extended ( a possibility which is indeed consistent with the best fit value of the radius of the comptonizing region found with the optxagnf model ) .",
    "the presence of a relativistic iron line , as well as a larger reflection component in the @xmath9 observation , may then be explained in terms of a less thick and/or more compact corona during that observation .",
    "while a detailed comparison of the present observations with previous ones is beyond the scope of this paper , we note that the spectrum in the @xmath9 observation was significantly steeper , suggesting an optically thin corona . in the future",
