    "exotic mesons may provide a unique experimental handle on gluonic excitations . by definition , spin exotic mesons have quantum numbers , spin ( @xmath6 ) , parity ( @xmath7 ) and charge conjugation ( @xmath8 ) , which can not be obtained by combining quantum numbers of the valence quark and antiquark alone .",
    "thus other degrees of freedom , in addition to the valence components , must be present in the leading fock space component of an exotic meson to generate exotic combinations of @xmath9 , _ e.g. _ @xmath10 .",
    "since multiquark states are expected to fall apart , it is expected that the leading components of exotic mesons will contain excitation of the gluonic field in the presence of just the valence @xmath11 pair .",

    "there are also estimates of exotic meson properties based on the born - oppenheimer approximation which indicate that the gluon , if treated as a constituent particle in the ground state exotic meson , has to carry one unit of orbital angular momentum with respect to the @xmath11  @xcite .    whether exotic mesons have been seen experimentally is an open question .",
    "some tantalizing candidates exist in particular in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 decay channels  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 partial wave in the @xmath16 system measured in @xmath19 is as strong as the @xmath20 wave from the @xmath21 resonance decay .",
    "unfortunately , the exotic wave peaks at @xmath22 where there are no other well established resonances decaying to @xmath16",
    ". therefore extraction of the phase of the exotic wave , needed to establish its dynamical character , depends on model assumptions regarding the behavior of other waves . with the gluex / hall d experiment",
    "one should be able to circumvent this problem by measuring several decay modes with high statistics and performing a systematic coupled channel study together with the analysis of production mechanisms .",
    "if current experimental results do indeed correspond to elementary qcd exotic mesons , then there might be a potential discrepancy between model predictions and the experimental data .",
    "most models predict that exotic mesons should primarily decay to `` exotic '' channels dominated by two meson final states with one of them being an @xmath23-wave and the other @xmath7-wave meson  @xcite _ e.g. _ @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , while the experimental sightings come for analysis of `` normal '' decay channels _ i.e. _ with two @xmath23-wave mesons , like the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 modes . in this paper",
