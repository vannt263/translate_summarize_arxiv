    "<S> a new version of the semiempirical formula based on fission approach of alpha decay is derived , by using the optimum values of the fitting parameters determined for even - even nuclei , combined with hindrance factors for even - odd , odd - even , and odd - odd nuclides . </S>",
    "<S> the deviations from experimental data for two regions of nuclear chart ( 493 alpha emitters with @xmath0 and 142 transuranium nuclei including superheavies ( @xmath1 ) , respectively ) are compared with those obtained by using the universal curve and the viola - seaborg semiempirical relationship .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a fission barrier produced by shell effects in the region of superheavy nuclei @xcite continues to be proved by the successful synthesis of the heaviest nuclides @xcite , which stimulate a corresponding theoretical development ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . in 1969 </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that fission barriers as high as 8 to 12 mev develop due to the shell corrections around double shell closures which appeared in the standard shell model at @xmath2 , @xmath3 . nowadays </S>",
