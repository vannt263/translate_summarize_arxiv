    "quantum systems can ` tunnel ' through barriers , a wave - like behaviour that is a prototypical of non - classical behaviour .",
    "tunnelling plays a crucial role in a range of systems , including the theory of radioactivity , in which tunnelling is used to explain how radioactivity emerges from a nucleus despite the surrounding coulomb barrier @xcite ; and more recent applications include adiabatic quantum computing and annealing @xcite , and quantum electronics in nano - devices @xcite .",
    "we here try to clarify our understanding of in what sense tunnelling is non - classical , in particular to what extent it is associated with non - classical probabilistic behaviour .",
    "this is in order to understand tunnelling better , and we hope that this understanding will help in clarifying to what extent tunnelling allows for non - classical information processing . for example , the crucial component of information processing is the mathematical structure of the probabilistic system , rather than the physical parameters involved .    we find that tunnelling is indeed associated with non - classical probabilistic behaviour . in particular , we show that the wigner function of the state , a commonly - used and powerful phase space quasi - probability representation of quantum states , and/or a certain operator , which we termed in this article as tunnelling rate operator , has to contain negative values at some phase space points to be able to tunnel . here",
    "we list two examples :    1 .",
    "a gaussian wave packet inbound on a square potential has a positive wigner function @xcite .",
    "however , once it hits the potential , it loses its gaussian nature and this forces it to have a negative wigner function while part of it tunnels ; 2 .",
    "a ground state of a simple harmonic oscillator , which has a positive wigner function , has some probability of being found inside the binding potential region .",
    "the tunnelling rate operator we will define in this article contains negative values in this case .    to be able to derive our main statement we needed to define",
    "clearly what tunnelling is and this definition is also one of the contributions of this article .",
    "finally we note that wigner function as a real - vector representation of quantum states , fits into the generalised probabilistic framework , and therefore allows for extension to post - quantum theories . to our knowledge , this has not been realised before .",
    "lastly , we discuss the possibility of studying tunnelling in post - quantum theories .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "firstly we give a brief technical introduction to tunnelling and wigner functions .",
    "then we give new results , our definition of tunnelling and our main theorem .",
    "we discuss the interpretation of the theorem .",
    "finally we show that phase space quantum mechanics could be fitted into the generalised probabilistic framework , and demonstrate possible road maps into studying of the phenomenon of tunnelling in post - quantum theories .",
    "we now give a technical introduction .",
    "* quantum tunnelling * refers to the phenomenon where a quantum system with insufficient energy penetrates and passes through a potential barrier , which defies the laws of classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "it is usually demonstrated mathematically by solving the one spatial - dimension schrdinger equation with a rectangular potential barrier , such that tunnelling @xcite@xcite@xcite :    [ thm : sd ] * standard definition of tunnelling . * for a system in a rectangular potential barrier with the form @xmath0 an energy eigenstate with definite energy @xmath1 is a tunnelling state iff @xmath2 and the probability of finding the state in the region @xmath3 is non - zero .",
    "similar behaviours had been studied substantially in quantum systems in other potentials , such as series of rectangular barriers @xcite and double wells @xcite , where there is finite probability of locating an energy eigenstate in classically forbidden region .",
    "however , it is difficult to conceive an analogous definition for quantum systems in a superposition of energy eigenstates or in a more complicated potential , because it is less clear of what the corresponding classically forbidden regions are for both cases .    in order to provide a more general definition of quantum tunnelling and to understand this phenomenon in terms of non - classical probabilistic behaviour",
    ", we have chosen the * phase space formulation of quantum mechanics * as the fundamental framework . in this formulation , the state of a quantum system",
    "is described by a quasi - probability distribution , and observables are replaced by ordinary c - number functions in phase space .",
    "mathematically , a quantum state described by a vector in the hilbert space formulation @xmath4 can be transformed to a real function _ wigner function _ @xmath5 in the phase space formulation as @xmath6 such function satisfies the normalisation condition @xmath7 .",
    "however , a wigner function , in general , is not everywhere positive , and therefore can not be considered as a legitimate joint probability distribution in phase space .",
    "it was demonstrated that a wigner function of a pure continuous - variable state is positive if and only if the state is gaussian , which is known as _",
    "hudson s theorem _ @xcite .        a more general approach to describe states and operators @xmath8 as phase space functions @xmath9 is via _ weyl transformation _",
    ": @xmath10 and the inverse transformation , _ wigner transformation _ , is given by the formula : @xmath11}\\,d\\alpha\\,d\\beta\\,dx\\,dp.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] it is clear , from and , the wigner function of a pure state is the weyl transformation of a pure density operator @xmath12 . with the fact that a general density operator represented by @xmath13 , any mixed state in the phase space representation is described by a convex sum of pure wigner functions @xmath14 , where @xmath15 are the pure wigner functions and @xmath16 .",
    "another point to note about the transition between hilbert space formulation to phase space formulation of quantum mechanics is the preservation of non - commutative nature of operators via the introduction of _ star product _",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18,\\ ] ] such that the mapping can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the weyl transformation of the corresponding operator @xmath21 .    in the phase space formulation , the probability of a measurement outcome @xmath22 corresponding to @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 ) for a quantum state @xmath4 and a corresponding wigner function @xmath25 is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the wigner function of the state @xmath28 . in other words ,",
    "this probability is simply the integral of the product of wigner functions corresponding to the measurement outcome and the quantum state itself up to a normalisation constant @xmath29 .",
    "this result is analogous to its classical counterpart described by a distribution function @xmath30 , where the probability of a dynamic variable @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 f(x , p)\\,dx\\,dp . , \\ ] ] it should be clear that the probability corresponding to a measurement of a dynamic variable @xmath31 is the inner product of the state of the system @xmath30 , and a function that describes the measurement of probability of certain dynamic variable , which is known as an _ effect _ @xmath33 .",
    "for instance , in the examples above , the effects for calculating the probability @xmath22 , @xmath34 are @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath36 for classical and quantum cases respectively .    from the brief discussions above , it is shown that the mathematical structures of classical and quantum theories in phase space are similar to one another .",
    "such similarities are anticipated by the fact that classical probability theories and finite - dimensional quantum theories can be described by a unified framework known as the * generalised probabilistic theories * ( gpts ) @xcite .",
    "a finite - dimensional probabilistic theory under the framework of gpts has three major components : +   + * 1 .",
    "preparation . * a state of a finite - dimensional system is represented by a real vector from a _ state space _ , which is defined by the convex set of extremal states , or _ pure states _ , and the _ null state _",
    ", within a finite - dimensional vector space .",
    "such mathematical object completely determines the characteristics of the state of a physical system .",
    "+   + * 2 . transformation*. the evolution of any state vector is represented by a linear map that maps any state vector into another within the state space .",
    "+   + * 3 . measurement*. the probability of a particular measurement outcome for any state is described by the inner product between the state vector and an _ effect vector _ corresponding to such measurement .",
    "the inner product calculated must be ranging between 0 and 1 as a valid probability @xcite .",
    "the set of valid effects is known as the _ effect space _ , which is constructed as the convex sum of the set of _ pure effects _ and _ null effect_.    under the gpt framework , it is possible to construct probabilistic theories other than classical and quantum theories by varying its state space , the effect space and the set of allowed transformations , hence providing a way of generalising existing theories into _ post - quantum theories_. it was shown via these constructed post - quantum theories that certain quantum phenomena , such as non - unique decomposition of mixed states into pure states , and no - cloning theorem @xcite , which were thought to be novel to quantum systems , were actually generic properties of generalised probabilistic theories .",
    "however , these studies are limited to finite - dimensional systems and therefore can not be immediately applied to the study of quantum tunnelling , which is a wave - mechanical quantum phenomenon .",
    "therefore if it is possible to rewrite infinite - dimensional quantum mechanics in the framework of gpts , we could determine whether tunnelling is unique to quantum theories , and examine such phenomenon in post - quantum theories .",
    "it is clear from the previous section that is too restrictive to describe the entire class of tunnelling behaviour . a general quantitative definition of tunnelling is therefore required to be :    1 .   mathematically well - defined ; 2 .   able to recover as a special case ; 3 .   able to reflect the non - classicality of the behaviour ; 4 .",
    "able to supply a quantitative criteria of tunnelling for systems with general potentials and states without definite energy .    in order to construct such a definition of tunnelling",
    ", we starts with the law of conservation of energy for a classical particle in a potential @xmath37 :    1 .",
    "classical kinetic energy @xmath38 is positive , due to the reality of momentum @xmath39 . by conservation of energy , for a particle with energy @xmath40 ,",
    "@xmath41 this implies that a particle with energy @xmath40 is not allowed in the region @xmath42 classically , where @xmath43 is a real variable representing position .",
    "denote this region as @xmath44 , as the classically forbidden region for states with energy @xmath40 .",
    "2 .   for two energies @xmath45 and @xmath46 , such that @xmath47 , their respective classically forbidden regions satisfy @xmath48 , since @xmath49 3 .",
    "classically , only a particle with energy @xmath50 is allowed to be in @xmath44 , since : 1 .   for @xmath51 ,",
    "@xmath44 is classically forbidden region ; 2 .   for @xmath52 , by ( 2 ) , @xmath53 is also classically forbidden .    with the concluding statement , and with the general principle that tunnelling is a phenomenon that violates this classical constraint , we formulate the definition of tunnelling to be :    [ def : qm - gd ] * general definition of tunnelling . * for a state in a potential given by @xmath37 , it is tunnelling if and only if there exists some energy @xmath40 , such that the probability of locating the state in region where @xmath54 is greater than that of measuring the state to have energy @xmath55 , or mathematically , @xmath56    notice that this definition does not require the state in question to be quantum or classical , and therefore allows the definition to be applied as a condition of general phenomenon on any physical systems , provided they can be described by energy and position as physical parameters .",
    "another advantage of using such general definition is its capabilities of extending to other non - classical behaviour , such as reflection over barrier as discussed in appendix a. it is also shown , in appendix b , that the conventional definition could be recovered as a special case of such general definition .      the necessary and sufficient condition for tunnelling , or equivalently the general definition , are based on cumulative probabilities @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in the phase space formulation , they are given by the inner product of the functions representing the difference of the effects corresponding to the two probabilities , and the wigner function representing the state .",
    "the general definition of tunnelling applied in this picture implies :    [ thm : pstns ] * necessary and sufficient conditions of tunnelling in phase space . *",
    "a state represented by a distribution function @xmath30 in phase space is tunnelling if and only if there exists some @xmath40 : @xmath59(x , p ) f(x , p)\\,dx\\,dp > 0,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the effects corresponding to the probability measurement of outcome @xmath62 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "this statement is basically a rewritten form of the general definition .",
    "as by the definition of the effects @xmath33 as stated in the theorem , @xmath63 by , the necessary and sufficient condition of tunnelling is therefore @xmath64 : @xmath65(x , p ) f(x , p)\\,dx\\,dp > 0,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which is the theorem to be proved .",
    "the theorem therefore shows that tunnelling is related to the distribution function and @xmath66 , and the latter is denoted as the _ tunnelling rate operator _ at @xmath40 .",
    "two important consequences of are :    [ col : pstn ] a state is non - tunnelling if , for every energy @xmath40 , the tunnelling rate operator , and the distribution function are non - negative everywhere in the phase space .",
    "an equivalent way of expressing the necessary and sufficient conditions of tunnelling is to specify the necessary and sufficient conditions of a non - tunnelling state , which is for all @xmath40 : @xmath67 f(x , p ) \\,dx \\,dp & \\leq 0 \\\\   \\iint \\left[\\mathcal{e}_{e > e^ * } - \\mathcal{e}_{\\{x|v(x)>e^*\\}}\\right ] f(x , p ) \\,dx \\,dp & \\geq 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clear that if both @xmath68 and @xmath30 is non - negative over all of phase space , then this condition will hold .",
    "notice here this theorem only provides a sufficient but not necessary condition for the case of non - tunnelling , as it is not the case where @xmath69 and @xmath30 must be positive for the non - tunnelling condition to be satisfied .",
    "another way of rephrasing the corollary , or indeed as a direct consequence of the main theorem , is :    [ col : pst ] if a state is tunnelling , then either tunnelling rate operator at some @xmath40 , or the distribution function , contain negativities .",
    "the result can be directly inferred from , by a simple reshuffling of the inequality that defines tunnelling : for some energy @xmath40 , @xmath70(x , p ) f(x , p)\\,dx\\,dp > 0 , \\\\",
    "[ \\mathcal{e}_{e > e^ * } -\\mathcal{e}_{\\{x|v(x ) > e^*\\}}](x , p ) f(x , p)\\,dx\\,dp < 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since it is impossible for the statement above to hold if any of the two functions are positive over the entire phase space , then either @xmath68 or @xmath30 must contain negativities .",
    "the last statement demonstrates the main claim of this paper : under a phase space framework , tunnelling implies negativities in the distribution representing the state , and/or the tunnelling rate operator at some energy levels . in the case of quantum systems , tunnelling implies negativities in the wigner function of the state and/or the tunnelling rate operator .",
    "the results of the previous section could immediately be applied to the study of generic behaviours of classical and quantum theories .",
    "one important result is that classical phase space mechanics do not allow tunnelling , because as shown in appendix c , both the phase space distributions representing a state and the tunnelling rate operator does not contain non - negativities , and by , classical states can not tunnel .",
    "however , in quantum theories , the non - negativity conditions of the functions are relaxed .",
    "this can be attributed to the following two elements of quantum phase space theory : +   + * 1 .",
    "wigner function as quasi - probability distribution .",
    "* a quantum state in phase space is represented by wigner function , which generally contains negative values in general .",
    "+   + * 2 .",
    "deformation of effect * @xmath71 generally speaking , the effect @xmath72 is identical for both classical and quantum case , while the effect @xmath61 is altered in the quantum case .",
    "both phenomena can be explained by the alteration in the eigenvalue equations for both position and hamiltonian operator represented in the phase space picture , as will be shown here .",
    "generally , for any dynamical variables @xmath73 , for both classical and quantum systems , their eigenstate with respect to the corresponding algebra has definite value @xmath74 if one conducts a measurement of @xmath75 on such system .",
    "consider first the dynamical variable @xmath43 as the position .",
    "the eigenvalue equation in classical systems with eigenstate @xmath76 and eigenvalue @xmath77 is @xmath78 and this equation has an obvious solution of @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is an arbitrary continuous positive real function which is normalised to unity @xmath81 .",
    "if the state in question is of such a form , the measurement of position on such state must give @xmath82 .",
    "at the same time , such function could be used as an effect to determine what is the probability of a certain state to have a position measurement of @xmath82 , as the inner product of this delta function against any state would give the proportion of the state with @xmath82 , i.e. the corresponding probability . therefore , classically , @xmath83 .    in the case of quantum systems , the product of any operators replaced by star - product of functions as a result of deformation quantisation .",
    "therefore , the eigenvalue problem is mapped to an equation with position eigenstate @xmath84 and eigenvalue @xmath77 : @xmath85 one simple way of solving the problem is to switch back to the hilbert space picture , where the equivalent problem is @xmath86 which has a well - known solution of @xmath87 . the wigner function for such a state",
    "is given by @xmath88 which is again of the form of a dirac delta function in position space after integrating away the momentum dependence . by the duality of effect and state in quantum theory , the effect for @xmath82",
    "is therefore @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , since both the classical and quantum position eigenstates are of the form of a dirac delta function @xmath90 , the effect corresponding to measurement in position space are therefore identical , which implies @xmath72 is of the same form for both classical and quantum calculations .    however , this is not the case for @xmath61 .",
    "the energy eigenstate @xmath91 with energy @xmath1 for a classical system satisfies @xmath92 which gives @xmath93 $ ] . the quantum energy eigenvalue equation in phase space for an energy eigenstate @xmath94 and energy @xmath1 ,",
    "however , is altered to be @xmath95 here , the energy eigenstate as a weyl map of @xmath96 is no longer of the form @xmath97 $ ] , as the introduction of star product implies the functional dependence of energy eigenstate is no longer purely on the functional form of the dynamical variable .",
    "this can be seen by the bopp shift representation of star product , where the functional dependence of the energy eigenstate depends also on the position and momentum derivatives of the hamiltonian function .",
    "therefore , the energy eigenstate @xmath61 is not identical to its classical counterpart .    with the energy effect @xmath98 , and the fact that wigner functions are generally not completely positive",
    ", @xmath99 generally contains negativity .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath100 generally contains negativity , given that @xmath72 is non - negative .",
    "this demonstrates that how this operator can violate the classical case by containing negativities .",
    "a special class of states in quantum mechanics is gaussian states , which has non - negative wigner functions in phase space representation . by",
    ", a statement for gaussian states could be made as :    [ cor : ptg ] a gaussian state can tunnel only if the function @xmath100 contains negativities for some @xmath40",
    ".    by , if a state is tunnelling , then either @xmath100 or @xmath5 contains negativities for some energy @xmath40 . by hudson s theorem @xcite , the wigner function representing gaussian state is non - negative over all of phase space",
    ". therefore , if a gaussian state is tunnelling , then @xmath100 must contain negativities for some energy @xmath40 .",
    "this corollary serves two purposes .",
    "first of all , since a gaussian state is represented by a positive wigner function over phase space , it is often considered to be a valid joint - probability distribution and as the ` least non - classical ' state @xcite .",
    "this corollary serves as a reminder that despite it is true that negativity in wigner functions as distribution functions is a novel feature in phase space quantum theory , a completely positive wigner function can still exhibit non - classical behaviours , which , in this specific case , is due to the deformation in effects as discussed in the last section .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the sub - theory of gaussian quantum mechanics can be constructed by imposing certain epistemic restriction on classical phase space mechanics @xcite , in which only gaussian states , measurements and operations are considered .",
    "this reinforces the conclusion that the tunnelling rate operator corresponding to the measurements in question is the culprit for a gaussian state to exhibit tunnelling , for otherwise , the system would simply be classical and can not tunnel .",
    "secondly , the discussion of tunnelling in gaussian states allows for simplified examples of the application of the previous results , as the tunnelling rate operator @xmath100 determines the tunnelling behaviour of these gaussian states .",
    "consider the following two examples of gaussian states : +   + * 1 .",
    "quantum tunnelling of wave packets .",
    "* a particle in quantum mechanics is often described by a wave packet , which has a localised waveform as a superposition of energy eigenstates @xcite . in particular , gaussian wave packets are often used in the study of quantum tunnelling and general quantum mechanics problem @xcite . by studying gaussian wave packets in rectangular potential barrier , it also introduces dynamical aspects into the problem of tunnelling , as the position probability distribution of a quantum system now changes over time due to the relative phase differences between the different components of its energy eigenstates .",

    "an example of such a simulation is shown in , where a wave packet , with initial gaussian shape and average energy lower than the potential height , passes through the barrier , and the gaussian nature of the wave packet is destroyed .",

    "however , using our general definition , it could be demonstrated that such a state is indeed tunnelling at certain times during the propagation of the wave packet , as @xmath108 as shown in .",

    "consider the ground state of the quantum harmonic oscillator : if one varies the state by shrinking @xmath216 and @xmath217 simultaneously , and therefore violating the uncertainty principle and purity condition by altering the covariance matrix @xmath191 in , then while the ground state energy effect vector would shrink correspondingly , the variation is continuous and therefore the inner product that specifies the tunnelling rate would still retains negativity in the close vicinity of the quantum case . therefore , it seems that tunnelling can be a generic property of post - quantum theories and is not unique to quantum theory .",
    "however , to fully study the phenomenon of tunnelling in post - quantum theories rigorously , it is necessary to construct a systematic theory that describes the effects on the effect space by alteration of the state space .",
