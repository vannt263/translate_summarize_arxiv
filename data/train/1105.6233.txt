    "since the discovery of superconductivity in iron pnictides with high transition temperature ( @xmath8)@xcite , substantial experimental and theoretical works have been performed to clarify the mechanism of superconductivity .",

    "the fully - gapped state is also supported by the rapid suppression in @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ) below @xmath12 @xcite . on the other hand , p - doped ba122 @xcite and lafepo@xcite show the nodal line behavior ( @xmath13-linear dependence ) in penetration depth measurements . in these compounds ,",

    ", we have demonstrated that the orbital fluctuation mediated fully - gapped @xmath2-wave state without sign - reversal ( @xmath3-wave state ) is realized by the inter - orbital nesting , by taking the electron - phonon interaction into account.@xcite in the latter scenario , the close relation between @xmath12 and the crystal structure revealed by lee @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath12 becomes the highest when the as@xmath16 cluster is regular tetrahedron , is automatically explained @xcite .",
    "moreover , the latter scenario is consistent with the large sc gap on the @xmath17-orbital band in ba122 systems @xcite , observed by bulk - sensitive laser arpes measurement @xcite .",
    "in addition , the orthorhombic structure transition and the corresponding shear modulus softening is well explained theoretically @xcite . in newly discovered k@xmath18fe@xmath19se@xmath19 with @xmath20k ,",
    "in which only electron - pockets exist , orbital - fluctuation - mediated fully - gapped @xmath3-wave state@xcite or spin - fluctuation - mediated nodal @xmath21-wave state@xcite had been predicted theoretically .",
    "thus , it is important to clarify the sign of the sc gap via phase - sensitive experiments .",
    "nonmagnetic impurity effect offers us useful phase - sensitive information . in iron pnictides , the sc state survives against high substitution of fe sites by other element ( more than 10% ) .",
    "@xcite these results support the @xmath3-wave state since the @xmath7-wave state is very fragile against impurities , similar to other unconventional superconductors .",
    "@xcite moreover , impurity driven crossover from @xmath7-wave state to @xmath3-wave state had been discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "another promising method is the neutron scattering measurement : as discussed by monthoux and scalapino in ref .",

    "the resonance occurs under the condition @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the resonance energy and @xmath25 is magnitude of the sc gap .",

    "moreover , the resonance condition @xmath23 is not surely confirmed since it is difficult to determine the value of @xmath25 accurately .",

    "next , we comment on the claim ( iii ) .",
    "they pointed out the spectrum in the @xmath15-wave state with @xmath0mev are different from that in the @xmath3-wave state with @xmath260mev . here , we show the results of both @xmath3- and @xmath15-wave states in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , for ( b ) @xmath212mev and ( c ) @xmath248mev .",
    "since both spectra are almost identical , we can not distinguish between the @xmath3- and @xmath7-wave states by the spectrum at the wave vector @xmath255 _ for the same @xmath25_. this result is reasonable because sign of the sc gap is preserved through the @xmath261 shift for both the @xmath3- and @xmath7-wave states .",
    "although claim ( iii ) is based on their numerical result in which the hump of the @xmath3-wave state appears only for @xmath262mev , the prominent hump appears in the @xmath3-wave state with @xmath0mev in our improved numerical results as shown in fig . [ fig1](a ) and ( c ) .",
    "thus , we conclude it is impossible to distinguish between the @xmath3- and @xmath15-wave states with @xmath0mev .",
    "we have studied the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath44 in iron - based superconductors for both @xmath3- and @xmath15-wave states , by developing more accurate numerical method and introducing the high - energy dependence of the sc gap .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath3-wave state , the dissipationless qps for @xmath181 produce a prominent hump - shaped enhancement in @xmath44 just above @xmath4 till @xmath47 .",
    "this `` dissipationless mechanism '' is unrelated to the resonance .",
    "the peak energy of the hump will shift to lower energy if we consider the band - dependence and/or the anisotropy of the sc gap , as we discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , in the @xmath15-wave state , very high and sharp resonance peak appears at @xmath23 . in order to explain small and broad peaks observed in refs.@xcite as the resonance peak in the @xmath15-wave state , sufficient inhomogeneity or small sc volume fraction",
    "would be required . however , the @xmath7-wave state is fragile against inhomogeneity .",
    "we concluded that the small and broad spectral peak observed in iron pnictides is naturally reproduced based on the @xmath3-wave state in the absence of inhomogeneity , rather than the @xmath15-wave state .    in the comment on the present paper written by nagai and kuroki on arxiv@xcite",
    ", the authors repeated their claim `` smallness of the hump in the @xmath3-wave state '' based on the `` old method '' that was first developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , however , we actually obtained large hump using the `` new method '' , which is mathematically superior to the old method .",

    ", we confirmed that a large hump structure appears just above @xmath4 due to the reduction in the inelastic qp scattering @xmath45 , which is the most important finding in this paper .",
