    "graph polynomials contain various information about graphs and are used to analyze the properties of graphs and networks .",
    "two of the most important single - variable graph polynomials are the chromatic polynomial and the flow polynomial .",
    "studying these polynomials is an active area of research with many theoretical consequences and practical applications .",
    "the chromatic polynomial is related to the potts model , which models the behavior of certain elements of solid state physics , like crystals and ferromagnets .",
    "the coefficients of the chromatic polynomial have another application in statistical mechanics ",
    "they are used to model state changes , as described in the work of sokal @xcite .",
    "the chromatic polynomial is also related to stirling numbers , and thus finds applications in a variety of analytic and combinatorics problems ; see @xcite .",
    "there are important theoretical questions surrounding the flow polynomial as well , such as the 5-flow conjecture and other flow existence theorems and conjectures .",
    "the flow polynomial also has an application in crystallography and statistical mechanics as it is related to models of the physical properties of ice and crystal lattices @xcite . for more applications of chromatic and flow polynomials ,",
    "see the comprehensive survey of ellis - monaghan and merino @xcite and the bibliography therein .",
    "unfortunately , computing the chromatic and flow polynomials of a graph are very challenging tasks .",
    "these problems are np - hard for general graphs , and even for bipartite planar graphs as shown in @xcite , and sparse graphs with @xmath0 . in fact , most of the terms of the chromatic and flow polynomials of general graphs can not even be approximated ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , a large volume of work in this area is focused on exploiting the structure of specific types of graphs in order to derive closed formulas , algorithms , or heuristics for computing their chromatic and flow polynomials .",
    "in particular , classes of graphs which are generalizations of trees , cliques , and cycles are frequently investigated .",
    "for example , wakelin et al .",
    "@xcite consider a class of graphs called polygon trees and find their chromatic polynomials ; they also characterize the chromatic polynomials of biconnected outerplanar graphs and the flow polynomials of their dual graphs .",
    "whitehead @xcite characterizes the chromatic polynomials of a class of clique - like graphs called @xmath1-trees .",
    "furthermore , lazuka @xcite obtains explicit formulas for the chromatic polynomials of cactus graphs , gordon @xcite studies tutte polynomials ( a generalization of chromatic and flow polynomials ) of rooted trees , and mphako - banda @xcite derives formulas for the chromatic , flow , and tutte polynomials of flower graphs .    in this paper , we consider yet another generalization of trees , cliques , and cycles .",
    "we define a generalized vertex join of a graph @xmath2 to be the graph obtained by joining an arbitrary multiset of the vertices of @xmath2 to a new vertex .",
    "we find the chromatic polynomials of generalized vertex joins of trees , cliques , and cycles , and use the duality of chromatic and flow polynomials to find the flow polynomials of certain other classes of graphs , including outerplanar graphs .",
    "thus , we complement the work of wakelin et al .",
    "@xcite on chromatic polynomials of outerplanar graphs and flow polynomials of their duals , by characterizing the flow polynomials of outerplanar graphs and the chromatic polynomials of their duals .",
    "several related results are included as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we recall some notions and notations related to graph theory and graph polynomials . in section  3 , we list well - known technical tools used in the computation of chromatic and flow polynomials . in section  4 , we calculate the chromatic polynomials of generalized vertex joins of trees ; we relate these results to outerplanar graphs in section  5 . in section  6",
    ", we consider generalized vertex joins of cliques and cycles , and related dual results .",
    "we conclude with some final remarks and open questions in section  7 .",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with basic graph theoretic notions and operations .",
    "for an extensive background on graph theory , one is referred to @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we first recall the definition of a multiset and related terms , followed by select graph theoretic notions used in the paper .",
    "let @xmath3 be a graph .",
    "a _ multiset _ @xmath4 over @xmath5 is a collection of vertices of @xmath5 , each of which may appear more than once in @xmath4 .",
    "the number of times a vertex @xmath6 appears in @xmath4 is the _ multiplicity _ of @xmath6 .",
    "the _ underlying set _ of @xmath4 is the set @xmath7 which contains the ( unique ) elements of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 , a multiset @xmath4 over @xmath5 could be @xmath9 and the underlying set of @xmath4 is @xmath10 . using this notion",
    ", we define the _ generalized vertex join of @xmath2 using @xmath4 _ to be the graph @xmath11 .",
    "note that if the multiplicity of @xmath6 in @xmath4 is @xmath12 , there are @xmath12 parallel edges between @xmath6 and @xmath13 in @xmath14 .",

    "@xmath19 is obtained by identifying @xmath20 and @xmath6 and removing any edges between them .",
    "note that @xmath2 does not need to have the edge @xmath21 for @xmath19 to be defined .",
    "finally , we say that @xmath2 is _ biconnected _ if @xmath22 has exactly one connected component for all @xmath23 .    many of the graphs considered in this paper are _ planar _ graphs  i.e. , they can be drawn in the plane so that their edges do not cross each other . a graph drawn in such a way",
    "is called a _ plane _ graph .",
    "if @xmath2 is a plane graph , its _ dual _ @xmath24 is a graph that has a vertex corresponding to each face of @xmath2 , and an edge joining the vertices corresponding to neighboring faces for each edge of @xmath2 .",
    "note that if @xmath2 is connected , @xmath25 .",
    "the _ weak dual _ of @xmath2 is the subgraph of @xmath24 whose vertices correspond to the bounded faces of @xmath2 .",
    "we close this section by introducing the two graph polynomials we will investigate in the paper .",
    "a vertex coloring of @xmath2 is an assignment of colors to the vertices of @xmath2 so that no edge is incident to vertices of the same color .",
    "a @xmath26-coloring of @xmath2 is a vertex coloring using at most @xmath26 colors .",
    "the _ chromatic polynomial _",
    "@xmath27 counts the number of @xmath26-colorings of @xmath2 ; if the dependence on @xmath26 is implied in the context , this can be abbreviated as @xmath28 .",
    "a closely related polynomial is the flow polynomial .",
    "a nowhere - zero @xmath26-flow of @xmath2 is an assignment of values @xmath29 to the edges of an arbitrary orientation of @xmath2 so that the total flow entering each vertex is congruent modulo @xmath26 to the total flow leaving each vertex .",
    "the _ flow polynomial _",
    "@xmath30 counts the number of nowhere - zero @xmath26-flows in @xmath2 ; if the dependence on @xmath26 is implied , this can be abbreviated as @xmath31 .",
    "before we present our main results , we will list a number of well - known facts frequently used in the computation of chromatic and flow polynomials .",
    "proofs of these and other results are given by tutte @xcite . in what follows , let @xmath3 be a graph with @xmath32 components .",
    "@xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    many of these identities can also be used in the computation of flow polynomials , as the flow polynomial can be obtained from the chromatic polynomial in the following way : @xmath36 furthermore , if @xmath37 , the following identities allow us to find the flow and chromatic polynomials of each component separately .",
    "@xmath38    finally , closed formulas for the chromatic polynomials of some specific graphs are known . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath39 is the complete graph on @xmath40 vertices and @xmath41 is the cycle on @xmath40 vertices ,    @xmath42    let @xmath3 be any graph , @xmath4 be a multiset over @xmath5 , and @xmath7 be the underlying set of @xmath4 . by ( 3 ) , @xmath43 .",
    "thus , when computing the chromatic polynomial of a generalized vertex join of graph @xmath14 , we can assume without loss of generality that the multiplicity of every element in @xmath4 is 1 .",
    "the reason we consider multisets instead of sets of vertices is because allowing certain muliple edges in a class of graphs corresponds to a larger class of dual graphs . in turn",
    ", this can lead to broader results about flow polynomials , allowing us to easily establish the flow - equivalence of certain graphs .",
    "for instance , in the next section , we compute the chromatic polynomials of generalized vertex joins of trees .",
    "we show in section 5 that the duals of these graphs are outerplanar graphs , where the added vertex @xmath13 is the one corresponding to the outer face . allowing multiple edges between @xmath13 and each vertex of the tree",
    "means the family of duals includes all biconnected outerplanar graphs , instead of ones for which at most one edge from each bounded face borders the outer face .",
    "thus , we are able to state a broader result about flow polynomials .",
    "a similar principle is used in section 6 with  generalized wheel \" graphs .",
    "we are now equipped with the motivation and technical tools necessary to derive our main results .",
    "let @xmath44 be a tree with @xmath45 , @xmath4 be a multiset over @xmath5 , and let @xmath46 be the generalized vertex join of @xmath47 using @xmath4 . for short , we will call @xmath46 a _",

    "note that since @xmath54 , there is at least one cycle , so not all edges of @xmath46 are bridges .",

    "now , let @xmath2 be any outerplanar graph .",
    "if @xmath2 has several components , by ( 5 ) we can compute the flow polynomial of each component separately . if a connected outerplanar graph is not biconnected , then it has a bridge , so its flow polynomial is zero .",
    "thus , we can compute the flow polynomial of any outerplanar graph using the algorithm from section 4 ; we state this in the corollary below .",
    "the flow polynomial of a ( not necessarily simple ) outerplanar graph @xmath2 can be found in polynomial time and space using algorithm 1 .    if @xmath159 , then since @xmath2 is outerplanar , @xmath160 .",

    "@xmath183 ; @xmath184.,title=\"fig : \" ]    now , suppose @xmath7 is the underlying set of @xmath4 ; by ( 3 ) , @xmath185 .",
    "also , @xmath186 .",
    "but @xmath182 is some generalized vertex join cycle @xmath187 , so by ( 4 ) and ( 3 ) , @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the underlying set of @xmath190 .",
    "thus , if we can find the chromatic polynomial of a generalized vertex join cycle @xmath191 where every element of @xmath7 has multiplicity 1 , we can find the chromatic and flow polynomials of all generalized vertex join cycles .    with this in mind , without loss of generality ,",
    "let @xmath169 be a generalized vertex join cycle where every element of @xmath4 has multiplicity 1 .",
    "let @xmath192 be the spokes of @xmath169 in clockwise order , and @xmath193 be the corresponding faces of @xmath169 ( as labeled in figure 4 ) .",
    "define @xmath194 and @xmath195 . then , repeatedly using ( 1 ) , we have the following identity ; see figure 5 for an illustration .",
    "@xmath196     ( on far left ) into simpler graphs as described in ( 10 ) . using ( 1 )",
    ", the graphs in the top row can be further decomposed into the cycles making up their bounded faces , since in these graphs , the faces bordering the contraction share only one edge with the rest of the graph . ]",
    "we can think of the faces of @xmath169 as cycles , where face @xmath146 has size @xmath147 .",
    "then , the faces of @xmath197 have sizes @xmath198 , where    @xmath199    hence , the faces of @xmath200 have sizes @xmath201 .",
    "let @xmath202 be the ( multi)set of sizes of faces of @xmath200 , i.e. @xmath203 .",
    "then , we can start from a face of @xmath200 which borders the contracted edge , and use the fact that this face shares just one edge with the rest of the graph to successively apply ( 2 ) and evaluate @xmath204 .",
    "then , @xmath205 , so    @xmath206    now , as was mentioned previously , a generalized vertex join cycle @xmath169 corresponds uniquely to an integer string @xmath181 . from @xmath177",
    ", we can obtain @xmath180 by simple and fast manipulations .",
    "for instance , @xmath180 can be constructed by starting from an empty string , and for @xmath207 , concatenating :    a_i-1 & a_i 2 , + 1 & a_i = 1 , + z+1 & a_i + & ( c_s ) z.    moreover , the sizes of the faces of @xmath169 , @xmath208 , can be obtained by adding 2 to every element of @xmath180 .",
    "thus , these definitions , along with ( 11 ) , can be used to compute @xmath202 used in the formula above , and thus we can compute @xmath171 and @xmath172 for any generalized vertex join cycle @xmath169 .",
