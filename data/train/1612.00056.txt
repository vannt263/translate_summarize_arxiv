    "in several areas of physics and biomedical engineering ( e.g. , for nmrs ) , data in the frequency domain is obtained on polar grids , i.e. , grids rotationally invariant under a certain number of discrete rotations .",
    "the extraction of spatial information from this data thus requires the implementation of an efficient inverse fourier transform on such grids .",
    "this problem is the focus of a large literature spanning a lot of different techniques as , for example , the implementation of a polar fft , as in @xcite , or the application of the general theory of non - equispaced fft , as in @xcite .",
    "a different , very natural but numerically challenging , possible solution is the exploitation of the decomposition of the 2d fourier transform in polar coordinates .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that the fourier transform @xmath9 of a square integrable function @xmath0 can be obtained by , firstly , developing @xmath0 in a multipole series @xmath10 , and then applying the hankel transform on the @xmath11 s .",
    "more precisely , see section  [ sec : se2 ] for details , polar coordinates allow to identify @xmath12 .",
    "then , letting @xmath13 be the fourier transform on @xmath14 and @xmath15 be the one on @xmath16 , we have @xmath17 here , we implicitly identified @xmath18 , and let @xmath19 be the so - called _ fourier - bessel operator_. namely , @xmath20 is a renormalized version of the @xmath21-th hankel transform operator : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath21-th bessel function of the first kind .    clearly , due to the complicated ( non - periodic ) nature of bessel functions , the main difficulty encountered with this approach is the computation of the hankel transform , for which many algorithms have been proposed , see e.g. , @xcite or @xcite for a review . in this paper , we propose a completely different approach from what is usually taken : instead of approximating @xmath0 in the continuous space variable by a discrete sampling , we develop a method to exactly evaluate a counterpart of for discretized frequencies .",
    "we propose to consider the data to represent not square integrable functions of @xmath24 , but a finite - dimensional subspace of _ bohr almost - periodic functions_. that is , we assume to be given a set of frequencies @xmath25 invariant under rotations of multiples of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , representing the frequencies obtained via the sensors ( see figure  [ fig : bispectral ] ) , and we focus on functions @xmath28 with frequencies in @xmath29 .",
    "that is , @xmath30 observe that , if the set @xmath29 is contained in a periodic square lattice of @xmath16 , the above essentially coincides with the discrete fourier transform , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath31 be the slice of angle @xmath32 .",
    "then , by its rotational invariance , we have that @xmath29 is completely determined by some @xmath33 .",
    "namely , letting @xmath34 be the rotation of @xmath35 around the origin , we have @xmath36 .",
    "the space of functions of the form , denoted by @xmath37 , is then invariant under the action of the semidiscrete group of rototranslations @xmath7 , that is , the subgroup of the group @xmath8 of euclidean motions where only the rotations @xmath38 are allowed . as a first step in our analysis , exploiting the deep connection between decomposition and the action of the group of rototranslations @xmath39 on @xmath24 , we generalize to almost - periodic function on a group @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the semidirect product of two abelian groups , with @xmath42 finite .",
    "the finiteness of @xmath42 then allows us to express decomposition in terms of a generalized fourier - bessel operator , which turns out to be well defined on a large set of numerically relevant functions : finite - dimensional @xmath42-invariants sets of bohr almost periodic functions on @xmath40 .",
    "these sets , denoted by @xmath43 , are composed of linear combinations of the matrix coefficients of a finite set @xmath1 of irreducible unitary @xmath44-dimensional representations of @xmath40 .",
    "this is the content of theorem  [ thm : general ] in section  [ sec : harmonic ] .",

    "this is an instance of a very general problem , and can be seen as a generalization of the discrete fourier transform and its inverse , that act on regular square grids , i.e. , invariant under the the action of @xmath50 .    .",
    "the blue region is @xmath51 , see section  [ sec : ap - interp ] . ]    to better precise the above result , let @xmath52 be such that @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and denote by @xmath55 and @xmath56 the sets of complex - valued functions over @xmath29 and @xmath57 , respectively .",

    "up to a prefactorization of @xmath64 , e.g.  via a qr decomposition , the computation of @xmath68 has then a computational complexity of @xmath69 .",
    "our main ( practical ) result , contained in corollary  [ cor : ap - r ] ( see section  [ sec : image ] ) , is that the row - wise discrete fourier transform interwines @xmath60 with a block diagonal operator whose blocks have size @xmath70 : the discrete fourier - bessel operator .",
    "this allows to lower the computation complexity of computing @xmath60 to @xmath71 and @xmath68 to @xmath72 . as a final note ,",
