    "the presently most accurate way to measure the polarized gluon distribution function in the nucleon is to study those processes which can be calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , i.e. for which the involved production cross sections and subprocess asymmetries can be predicted .",
    "one of the cleanest ways to probe qcd is to investigate heavy quarkonia production processes .",
    "heavy quark pair production processes can be controlled perturbatively due to large mass of constituents . on the other hand ,",
    "heavy quark systems are mainly produced in gluon fusion processes and therefore , asymmetries are expected to be sensitive to the polarized gluon distribution in the nucleon .",
    "investigation of heavy quarkonia production processes in polarized experiments would also yield additional information about the quark - antiquark pair hadronization phase .",
    "the two - spin asymmetry in @xmath0 production has been studied in the framework of the so called color singlet model ( csm ) @xcite by morii and collaborators @xcite .",
    "but as was shown in the last years , the color singlet model does not describe satisfactorily the heavy quarkonium hadroproduction at tevatron and also at fixed target energies .",
    "while the csm gives a reasonable description of the @xmath0 production cross section distribution shapes over @xmath4 or @xmath5 at fixed target energies , it completely fails in the explanation of the integrated cross section ( a k factor 7 - 10 is needed to explain experimental data ) @xcite .",
    "the anomalously large cross section @xcite of the @xmath0 production at large transverse momenta at the tevatron revealed another negative feature of the csm . within the framework of the csm it is impossible to explain the anomalously large @xmath6 @xcite and direct @xmath0 production @xcite in the cdf experiment at the tevatron .",
    "the csm is a nonrelativistic model where the relative velocity between the heavy constituents in the bound state is neglected . but",
    "discrepancies between experimental data and the csm predictions hint that @xmath7 corrections as well as other mechanisms of quarkonium production , which do not appear in the leading order in @xmath8 , should be considered .",
    "expansion of quarkonium cross sections and decay widths in powers of relative velocity @xmath8 of heavy quarks in a bound state has recently been realized in terms of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite .",
    "this formalism implies not only color - singlet processes but the new color - octet mechanism , when a quark - antiquark pair is produced on small time scales in color octet states and evolves into a hadron by emission of soft gluons .",
    "the color octet mechanism takes into account the complete structure of the quarkonium fock space while in the csm only the dominant fock state is considered , which consists of a color singlet quark antiquark pair in the definite angular - momentum state ( higher order fock states are suppressed by powers of @xmath8 ) . according to the factorization approach based on the nrqcd , the production cross section for a quarkonium state h in the process @xmath9 can be written as @xmath10\\langle0|{\\cal o}^{h}[n]|0\\rangle}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the distribution function of the parton @xmath12 in the hadron @xmath13 .",
    "the subprocess cross section is separated into two parts : short distance   ( @xmath14 $ ] ) coefficients and   long   distance matrix elements @xmath15|0\\rangle$ ] .",
    "the @xmath14 $ ] is the production cross section of a heavy quark - antiquark pair in the @xmath12 and @xmath16 parton fusion .",
    "it should be calculated in the framework of pqcd .",
    "the [ n ] state can be either a color singlet or a color octet state .",
    "the @xmath15|0\\rangle$ ] describes the evolution of a quark - antiquark pair into a hadronic state .",
    "these matrix elements can not be computed perturbatively .",
    "but the relative importance of long distance matrix elements in powers of velocity @xmath8 can be estimated by using the nrqcd velocity scaling rules @xcite .",
    "shapes of the @xmath4 distribution of short distance color - octet matrix elements indicate that the new mechanism can explain the tevatron data of direct @xmath0 and @xmath17 production at large @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "but unlike color - singlet matrix elements connected with the subsequent hadronic nonrelativistic wave functions at the origin , color octet long distance matrix elements are unknown and should be extracted from experimental data . the color octet contribution to the @xmath0 photoproduction has been analyzed in the papers @xcite .",
    "recently , the @xmath0 hadroproduction at fixed target energies has been studied by including the color - octet mechanism @xcite .",
    "large discrepancies between experimental data and the csm predictions for the total cross section of the @xmath0 hadroproduction were explained .",
    "the color octet contribution is dominant in the @xmath0 hadroproduction at energies @xmath18 gev .",
    "the analyses carried out in these papers @xcite demonstrate that fitting the photoproduction and hadroproduction data at low energies requires smaller values than those extracted from prompt @xmath0 production at cdf at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "possible reasons for such discrepancies have recently been analyzed in the papers @xcite .",
    "the extraction of color - octet long distance matrix elements from the quarkonium production properties in polarized experiments would be an additional test of universality .    in the present letter we consider the color octet contribution to the double spin asymmetry of @xmath0 hadroproduction .",
    "unlike the previous calculations @xcite we consider @xmath19 color octet and color singlet pair production in @xmath20 subprocesses to obtain asymmetries at nonzero transverse momenta ( @xmath21 gev ) .",
    "such values of @xmath4 can not be caused by internal motion of partons in the nucleon and hence transverse momentum distributions of production cross section and asymmetries are calculable perturbatively .",
    "the double spin asymmetries in parton collisions are presented in section 2 . since heavy quarkonium",
    "is mainly produced in the gluon - gluon fusion subprocesses , the @xmath0 production asymmetry should be sensitive to the polarized gluon distribution function in the proton .",
    "we have calculated the expected asymmetry of @xmath0 production at hera-@xmath2 , one of the future options of hera @xcite ; an experiment utilizing an internal polarized nucleon target in the polarized hera beam with energy @xmath22 gev would yield @xmath23 gev . for comparison",
    ", we also considered the expected asymmetry of @xmath0 production in similar spin physics experiments at much higher energies at the rhic collider @xcite .",

    "the cross section of @xmath0 production can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the branching ratio of the corresponding @xmath19 state into @xmath0 .",
    "the production of each state of quarkonium is contributed by both color octet and color singlet states , as in the case of direct @xmath0 production @xmath29 ) \\langle0|{\\cal o}_8^{j/\\psi}(^{2s+1}l_j)|0\\rangle}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is over the states @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we consider only the dominant sets of color octet states by the nrqcd velocity expansion for the direct @xmath33 and @xmath34 state charmonium production .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "was considered asymmetry of @xmath0 hadroproduction in the color octet model exploiting only the lowest order subprocesses ( @xmath35 ) over the qcd coupling constant .",
    "subprocesses @xmath36 contribute only to the production of a quarkonium state at zero transverse momentum with respect to the beam axis .",
    "transverse momentum distributions of @xmath19 states and , consequently , the @xmath0 meson are not calculable in the @xmath37 region .",
    "to deal with the experimentally observable quantities ( taking into account the kinematic restriction on the angle with respect to the beam axis at hera-@xmath2 and at collider experiments ) , we consider the subprocess @xmath20 which gives the leading contribution to the quarkonium production with @xmath4 greater than @xmath38 gev .",
    "such large transverse momenta can not be caused by internal motion of partons in the nucleon and , respectively , subprocesses @xmath36 should not contribute to the production of quarkonia with @xmath21 gev . for calculating the expected asymmetries we consider only the following subprocesses : @xmath39 for the color octet and singlet states of a @xmath19-pair .",
    "the quark - antiquark collision subprocesses are not taken into account , because of small sea quark polarization in the proton .    using the symbolic manipulation program form @xcite",
    ", we have calculated the @xmath19-states production cross sections for different helicity states of colliding partons . for the color",

    "figs.1 and 2 present the values of the subprocess level asymmetries for the color octet and color singlet states production of a ( @xmath45)-pair depending on the two dimentionless quantities : @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the maximum momentum of the produced state in the subprocess . in figs.1 and 2",
    "are shown only the gluon fusion subprocess asymmetries because they give the main contribution to the hadronic level asymmetry .",
    "the cases of @xmath40 and @xmath41 singlet states are omitted in figs.1 and 2 .",

    "partonic level double spin asymmetries for @xmath49 and @xmath50 color octet and singlet states versus @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "as can be seen from figs.1 and 2 , the asymmetries are very similar for color octet and color singlet states with the same spin - orbital quantum numbers .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the limit @xmath51 ( i.e. at the threshold of heavy quark pair production ) @xmath52 for the scalar and tensor states tends to 1 and -1 , respectively .",
    "the limit @xmath53 means that the emitted gluon in the @xmath20 subprocess ( @xmath54 ) becomes soft and the helicity properties of the amplitude should be the same as those of the amplitude of the @xmath36 process ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the asymmetries for the process @xmath36 for scalar and tensor states are 1 and -1 , respectively .",
    "the existence of such limits serves as an additional test for our analytical calculations of cross sections @xmath56 . for scalar and tensor states",
    "are 1 and -1 , respectively .",
    "the existence of such limits serves as an additional test for our analytical calculations of cross sections @xmath56 .",
    "for the calculation of the hadronic level asymmetries of @xmath0 production we used the long distance matrix elements fitted from various experimental data .",
    "all color singlet matrix elements are related to the radial quarkonium wave functions at the origin and their derivatives . as in paper @xcite for this purpose",
    "we used the buchmller - tye wave functions values at the origin tabulated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the color octet matrix elements were fitted from the @xmath0 and higher charmonium state production data in various experiments .",
    "unfortunately , there are some discrepancies between the values of color octet matrix elements extracted from different experiments",
    ".    the number of color octet long distance matrix elements should be reduced by using the nrqcd spin symmetry relations : @xmath57 these relations are accurate up to @xmath58 .",
    "after   using   these   relations   we have only four independent matrix elements @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which give the main contributions to the @xmath0 hadroproduction cross section . for the first two parameters we used the values extracted from tevatron data by cho and leibovich @xcite .",
    "the other parameters , connected with the @xmath17 production , were also taken from @xcite .",
    "as concerns the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 , it is possible to extract only their combination from direct @xmath0 production data at tevatron @xcite : @xmath65 values for the other combinations are extracted from the @xmath0 photoproduction and fixed target hadroproduction data @xcite @xmath66 if one assumes that @xmath67 the photoproduction and fixed target hadroproduction values ( low energy values ) are an order smaller than the tevatron value ( high energy value ) .",
    "the possible sources for such a discrepancy are discussed in @xcite . in paper",
    "@xcite it is mentioned that the mass of the produced hadronic final state ( or intermediate color octet state ) must be higher than that of the @xmath0 meson  @xmath68 , because the intermediate octet state emits gluons with energy @xmath69 before transition into a color singlet state . but a charmonium is not a truly nonrelativistic system , the average relative velocity of constituents in @xmath0 is not very small  @xmath70 and emitted gluons in the @xmath45 pair hadronization phase have the energy @xmath71 gev .",
    "therefore the mass of the hadronic final state is about @xmath72 gev . at fixed target energies ,",
    "increasing the mass of the produced hadronic state leads to a reduced partonic luminosity because of a steeply falling gluon distribution function .",
    "consequently , the production cross section of the ( @xmath45 ) color octet state should be smaller .",
    "so , the true color octet long distance matrix elements must be larger , than those extracted by using @xmath73 as mass of the intermediate octet state @xcite .",
    "another possible source was mentioned in the paper @xcite and should be an uncertainty connected with the choice of different parametrizations for the gluon distribution function in fitting the direct @xmath0 production data at cdf @xcite .",
    "cho and leibovich used in their calculations the mrsd0 parametrization for parton distribution functions . at small values of @xmath74 gev , using a more reliable parametrization for small partonic @xmath75 ( grv lo or grv ho@xcite ) leads to @xmath76 times higher cross sections for the @xmath42 and @xmath40 color octet state production than those obtained by using mrsd0 parametrization @xcite .",
    "hence the fitted value of combination ( [ high ] ) should be approximately @xmath76 times smaller : @xmath77 at large @xmath78 gev all parametrizations give practically the same magnitude for the color octet states cross sections .",
    "hence if we use the new combination ( [ my ] ) one needs a larger value of the parameter @xmath79 to explain the experimental data for the @xmath0 cross section at @xmath78 gev : @xmath80 practically the same values for these parameters were obtained by beneke and krmer in a recent paper by fitting the cdf data of direct @xmath0 production and using the grv lo ( 1994 ) parametrization @xcite : @xmath81    for calculations of the hadronic level asymmetries we use three different sets for the three long - distance color octet matrix elements    @xmath82    as has been mentioned above , values for the other color octet parameters were taken from @xcite .",
    "for the calculations of the expected asymmetries we assume that the leading term in the combination ( [ my ] ) is the parameter @xmath63 ( or @xmath83 ) .",
    "only wiyh such a radical choice the values of high and low energy parameters should be consistent to each other .",
    "3a presents the expected asymmetries for the three sets of color octet parameters in the case when the parameter @xmath64 tends to zero ( @xmath63 is the leading term in the combinations ( [ high]),([low]),([my ] ) ) .    ( 16,7.5 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 8,0 )    figure  3 .",

    "3b represents the other radical choice , when the second parameter @xmath63 is zero . for the calculations of hadronic level asymmetries we used the grv lo parametrization for unpolarized distribution functions @xcite and a parametrization proposed by gehrmann and stirling for the polarized parton distribution function ( set a ) @xcite . for the mass of the charm quark the value",
    "@xmath87 gev was taken .",
    "as we can see from fig.3 , the magnitude of the asymmetry is more sensitive to the choice of the leading term in the combinations than to the choice of the particular set of the octet matrix elements .",

    "the errors are small in a wide range of pseudorapidity interval and give a possibility to distinguish between different parametrizations for @xmath103 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that gluon - quark collision subprocesses give about @xmath104 in @xmath105 .",
    "the dot - dashed curve in fig.4a represents the color - singlet contribution to the asymmetry for the parametrization set a ( only the color singlet contribution in @xmath105 was taken into account ) .",
    "it is clear that the color octet contribution dominates in the expected asymmetries of @xmath0 production .",
    "one may ask , where the such a difference in the shapes of asymmetries is coming from , as the subprocess asymmetries are not sensitive to colour structure .",
    "the main reason for this is the large matrix element @xmath106 .",
    "the production of such a state has a large asymmetry @xmath107 ( at @xmath108 , which is not far from the reality for the considered @xmath4 ) , providing the smooth transition to @xmath109 process , discussed above .",
    "as such a state is absent in csm , the large asymmetry itself is already a sign of a presence of colour - octet contribution .",
    "one of main parameters of the model is the mass of the charm quark .",
