    "the bo equation models the evolution of weakly nonlinear internal long waves .",

    "while there are several numerical methods for the bo equation which perform well in practice , indeed better than the one presented here , see @xcite for a recent comparison of different numerical methods , we emphasize that we here _ prove _ the convergence of our proposed scheme .",
    "having said this , there are results concerning error estimates for the bo equation in @xcite .",
    "however , error estimate analysis a priori assumes existence of solutions of the underlying equation , while our convergence analysis , as a by - product , can be viewed as a constructive proof for the existence of solutions of the bo equation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the scheme under consideration in this paper is similar to the scheme analyzed in @xcite , the only difference being that a different discretization of hilbert transform is introduced in this paper .",

    "* theorem 3.2 ) , a second - order error estimate in both time and space for smooth solutions can be obtained by our numerical method .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : scheme ] , we present necessary notations to introduce the crank  nicolson scheme and present the convergence analysis in the full line case , in section  [ sec : periodic ] we present the periodic hilbert transform and outline the proofs in the periodic setting , and finally in section  [ sec : numerics ] , we test our numerical scheme and provide some numerical results .",
    "throughout this paper , we use the letters @xmath32 , @xmath33 etc .  to denote various constants which may change from line to line .",
    "we start by introducing the necessary notation .",
    "derivatives will be approximated by finite differences , and the basic quantities are as follows . for any function @xmath34 , we set @xmath35 for some ( small ) positive number @xmath36 . if we introduce the averages @xmath37 and the shift operator @xmath38 we find that @xmath39    we discretize the real axis using @xmath36 and set @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",

    "next we present a lemma , which essentially gives a relation between discrete and continuous sobolev norms .",
    "since we shall use this lemma frequently , for the sake of completeness , we present a proof of this lemma in the full line case .",

    "we will now provide details for the discrete hilbert transform , which is different in full line and the periodic cases .    here",
    "we concentrate on the full line case , both regarding the hilbert transform and the difference scheme . the periodic case is similar , and we will only provide detailed proofs where the differences are sufficiently important .",
