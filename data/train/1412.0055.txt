    "in this paper , the effects of different disturbance types ( communication failures and noise ) upon the control strategy introduced in @xcite are analyzed and its impact upon the connectivity maintenance of multi - robot systems is evaluated . as this is a decentralized strategy that requires local communication between agents , the main requirement is to keep the agents always connected during communication .",
    "the strategy considered here is a representative of the so - called _ global _ connectivity techniques , which aim at maintaining a path between any pair of nodes ( _ i.e. _ robots ) , with a possible elimination of redundant links and creation of new links as needed .",
    "this is in contrast with _",
    "connectivity techniques such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , that guarantee that once a communication link between a pair of agents is active at time @xmath0 , it will be active @xmath1 , thus establishing an initial connection path from the outset . from the engineering point of view",
    ", however , imposing the maintenance of each single communication link is very costly , and a more intelligent scheme that removes redundant links and generate additional links as required can be more convenient .",
    "indeed , information exchange among all the agents is guaranteed under a _ global _ connectivity of the communication graph .",
    "for example , in @xcite the idea of periodic connectivity , in which the network regains connectivity at predefined intervals , is introduced .",
    "the control strategy introduced in @xcite ensures that _ global _ connectivity is maintained in a system of agents .",
    "this approach is inspired in the strategy previously defined in @xcite and introduces a way of obtaining , in a distributed way , the value of the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix , that , as shown in @xcite , measures the connectivity of a graph .",
    "regarding other estimate procedures that can be found in @xcite and @xcite , one of the principal advantages of the method described in @xcite is that it provides , besides the fiedler eigenvalue , estimations of its own gradients that are useful in real - time computations , as will be verified below .",
    "the connectivity scheme considered here is based on graph - theoretical considerations that are outlined in this section .",
    "further background details can be found in @xcite .    given @xmath2 mobile robots , the instantaneous communication links among them",
    "are modeled as edges in an undirected graph where each robot corresponds to a node .",
    "communication is assumed to be local , in the sense that each robot communicates only with a topological neighbourhood formed by nearby robots .",
    "thus , @xmath3 is defined as the neighborhood of the @xmath4-th robot , i.e. the set of robots that can exchange information with it .",
    "the complete communication graph is represented by the adjacency matrix @xmath5 , where each @xmath6 is defined as the weight of the edge between robots @xmath4 and @xmath7 , and is positive if @xmath8 , zero otherwise .",
    "this value needs to be computed in order to allow the local laplacian evaluation , as we ll see next . as undirected graphs are being considered , @xmath9 .",
    "finally , consider the laplacian matrix of the graph , defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the degree of the @xmath4-th node of the graph .",
    "@xmath13 holds some important properties , among which a remarkable relationship between its eigenvalues and the graph connectivity .",
    "namely , let @xmath14 , @xmath15 be the eigenvalues of @xmath13 .",
    "then    * the eigenvalues can be ordered such that @xmath16 * @xmath17 if and only if the graph is connected : @xmath18 is then defined as the algebraic connectivity of the graph .",
    "this means that any procedure that keeps the second eigenvalue @xmath18 of the communication graph at positive values guarantees graph connectivity , _",
    "i.e. _ , guarantees a communication path between any pair of nodes .",
    "in this section a control strategy assuming that each agent can compute the actual value of @xmath18 is first summarized .",
    "this hypothesis will be removed in the sequence , with the description of the distributed procedure .      for the sake of clarity , a brief synopsis of the estimation procedure introduced in @xcite",
    "will now be made .",
    "the estimation of @xmath18 is computed by each agent through an estimate of the corresponding eigenvector @xmath19 .    considering a group of @xmath2 single integrator agents ,",
    "let @xmath20 be the state vector describing the position of the @xmath4-th agent and @xmath21 be the its control input . then : @xmath22 where @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath24 is defined as : @xmath25 this control law ensures connectivity in a centralized framework , supposing each agent can compute the real value of the algebraic connectivity of the system .",
    "subsequently , this assertion will be removed with the decentralized estimation procedure in section [ decentralized_strategy ] .    the maximum communication range for each agent is denoted by @xmath26 , and the @xmath7-th agent is inside @xmath3 if @xmath27 .",
    "in order to implement the estimation procedure in a decentralized manner , a brief overview of the estimation procedure proposed by @xcite is presented in the next subsection . specifically , the estimation of @xmath18 is computed through the estimation of the corresponding eigenvector @xmath19 .    according to @xcite , @xmath18",
    "can be computed in a centralized framework as : @xmath28 where the edge - weights @xmath6 are defined as in eq .",
    ": @xmath29 where the scalar parameter @xmath30 is chosen to satisfy the boundary condition @xmath31 , in which @xmath32 is a small defined threshold .",
    "the control law implemented in this work was proposed in @xcite and extends the one introduced in eq . by adding a bounded control term @xmath33 to obtain some desired behavior : @xmath34 where @xmath24 is given by eq .",
    ": @xmath35    to implement the strategy described in @xcite in a decentralized way , each agent must compute an estimate of a component of the eigenvector @xmath19 , given by @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37^t$ ] and @xmath38 be the second smallest eigenvalue that the laplacian matrix would take if @xmath39 were the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "so @xmath38 can be computed in the following way : @xmath40\\ ] ] according to the procedure given in @xcite , each agent can compute its own estimate of @xmath18 using : @xmath41    however , the actual value of @xmath38 can not be computed by each agent , because actually , the real value of @xmath42 can not be calculated in a distributed way .",
    "nevertheless , an estimate of this average is available to each agent ( see @xcite for further details ) .    as shown in @xcite",
    ", @xmath43 is a good estimate of both @xmath18 and @xmath38 . in other words",
    ", it has been shown that , given a positive @xmath44 value , it is always possible to guarantee that the absolute difference between the real ( and distributedly unreachable ) value assumed by @xmath18 and its estimate obtained by agent @xmath4 ( given by @xmath43 ) is bounded from @xmath45 by @xmath44 for every agent .",
    "additionally , it has also been shown that , given another positive @xmath46 value , it is always possible to ensure that the absolute difference between the second smallest eigenvalue of @xmath13 ( that can be computed distributedly and denoted by @xmath38 ) and its estimate obtained by agent @xmath4 ( given by @xmath43 ) is bounded from @xmath45 by @xmath46 .",
    "that is , it can be concluded then that , given a positive integer @xmath47 ( given by @xmath48 ) , the absolute difference between the real ( and distributedly unreachable ) value assumed by @xmath18 and the second smallest eigenvalue of @xmath13 ( which can be computed distributedly ) is bounded from @xmath45 by @xmath47 . put differently ,",
    "each agent is able to ( locally ) compute using @xmath38 instead of @xmath18 and still be able to obtain a valid measure of the ( global ) system connectivity .",
    "even though the actual value of @xmath38 is not available to each agent , it is worth noting that the partial derivatives of @xmath38 can be implemented in a decentralized manner .",
    "this way , each robot can locally estimate the value of @xmath18 using eq . .",
    "this section will summarize the main notions of the control strategy studied in this work to address the connectivity maintenance within rendezvous and formation control problems .",
    "the edge - weights @xmath49 were redefined so that the connectivity control action was implemented in its vector form : @xmath50 additionally , a modified degree matrix of the graph was introduced as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , i.e. represents the degree of the @xmath4-th node of the graph . the modified laplacian matrix of the graph , then , is redefined accordingly as @xmath53 , and the control law of the system assumes the form : @xmath54 where @xmath33 is a vector containing the control laws for each one of the @xmath2 agents .      according to @xcite , the following consensus - based control law guarantees the convergence of the robots to the same position if the communication graph is connected : @xmath55      this is the final form of the implemented algorithm . instead of migrating to the same position , the agents assume a specific formation .",
    "as stated in @xcite , the following control strategy can be used , by adding a bias term @xmath56 to the control law in eq .",
    ": @xmath57 where @xmath58 for some @xmath59 , where @xmath60 represents the desired relative position for robot @xmath4 in the formation .",
    "this way , when the estimate of the algebraic connectivity is sufficiently greater than @xmath61 ( i.e. @xmath62 ) , the bias term is computed with laplacian matrix @xmath63 .",
    "when the value of the estimate of the algebraic connectivity falls and approaches @xmath61 , the bias term of the second case in eq . ensures @xmath33 is bounded and guarantees the connectivity maintenance among the agents .",
    "each agent @xmath4 computes its own @xmath19 estimate , given by @xmath64 , and from it obtains the spatial variation of the corresponding eigenvalue , given by @xmath65 as explained in section [ decentralized_strategy ] .",
    "this estimation system can be represented by the block diagram in fig . [",
    "fig : blockdiagram_originalsystem ] , where @xmath66 is given by eq . .",
    "in order to maintain the communication path between every pair of robots , each robot should be able to estimate effectively the global connectivity of the system only with local information . however , both communication failures and data corruption ( noise ) coexist in a realistic multi - robot communication system that is expected to keep itself connected , even in the presence of such disturbances .",
    "the model proposed in this work adds _ failure _ and _ noise _ as sources of corruption into the arrangement proposed in @xcite to study its effects on the final system performance .",
    "this situation can then be represented by the block diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : blockdiagram_modifiedsystem ] .",
    "the local estimation of @xmath19 made by each agent is a critical process to keep the system connected .",
    "errors in this estimate automatically imply incorrect values of @xmath38 , which may result in @xmath67 . given @xmath2 agents interacting in an unknown environment ,",
    "failures in data reception are considered .",
    "thus , let @xmath68 be the @xmath19 estimate made by agent @xmath4 in the presence of a communication failure . in this case , it is assumed that the agent stipulates a default value @xmath69 for the missing estimate : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the failure probability .",
    "the model adopted to simulate the effects of noise in the agents communication was the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) . in real system simulations ,",
    "noise is usually introduced in the communication channel modifying , in our case , the estimates of @xmath19 received from other agents .",
    "we model this process considering a noiseless communication channel that transmits an estimate already corrupted by noise when it enters it .",
    "thus , let @xmath68 be the @xmath19 estimate made by agent @xmath4 in the presence of an independent and additive distributed noise @xmath72 . thus : @xmath73 where @xmath74 ( @xmath72 represents the _ gaussian noise _ , that follows a normal distribution with @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "let us consider a group of @xmath2 single integrator agents , whose dynamics is described by eqs . , and .",
    "the @xmath19 estimate calculated by agent @xmath4 , in the presence of communication noise and failures can be expressed by : @xmath77    consider @xmath78 as the algebraic connectivity of a graph in the presence of disturbances and @xmath79 as the estimate of @xmath78 made by agent @xmath4 .",
    "if the disturbance effect considered is assumed to be limited , ( that is , there is no failure in _ any _ communication between two nodes and noise is not _ infinite _ ) , it can be concluded then that , similarly to what was seen in the absence of disturbances , @xmath43 is a good estimate of both @xmath78 and @xmath80 .",
    "it can be noticed that the estimation error of @xmath78 ( the connectivity measure in the presence of failure and/or noise ) is limited ( that is , @xmath81 such that @xmath82 ) .",
    "likewise , it can be found that the difference between the connectivity estimates and the second smallest eigenvalue of @xmath13 is also limited ( in other words , @xmath83 such that @xmath84 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath78 can be used to locally estimate the real value of @xmath18 , inaccessible to the agents .",
    "it is worth reminding that , besides not being possible to ensure that the estimation error of @xmath78 tends to @xmath45 , its value is larger as the effect of one or more types of disturbances in the communication betweeen agents gets larger .",
    "the results of the main simulations and experiments presented in this work are available _ _",
    "online__.    a real - world robot system , both terrestrial ( according to @xcite ) or aquatic ( as in @xcite ) , is expected to have a control effort acting on a frequency approximately in the order of @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , a _ first - order low pass filter _ was added to the control signal with a transfer function given by eq .",
    ", attenuating the contribution of frequencies higher than @xmath85 in @xmath86 in order to predict the performance of the proposed strategy in physical robots of the real world .",
    "@xmath87    a formation control problem with a varying number of agents ranging from @xmath88 to @xmath89 in an environment with @xmath90 was considered for our experiments .",
    "simulations have been carried out by considering the following parameter sets : @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",

    "the estimate of a component of @xmath19 made by agent @xmath4 ( denoted until now by @xmath36 ) will also be reported to simply as @xmath64 and for reference purposes , the connectivity measure in the absence of disturbances will be represented as @xmath96 .",
    "the results presented consider a typical execution of the connectivity maintenance algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "typical runs of five agents performing formation control correspond to the robots starting at random initial positions and supposed to converge to a pentagonal configuration , while deviating from randomly placed point obstacles along the path .      in figure",

    "as can be seen , even in the presence of failures in the communication process , the system kept itself connected .",
    "the initial estimates ( @xmath100 in @xmath0 ) reach a maximum at the beginning ( @xmath101 in @xmath102 ) of the dynamics , while the connectivity decreases ( from @xmath103 in @xmath0 ) and temporarily stabilizes at a specific level ( @xmath104 from @xmath105 till @xmath106 ) , declining slowly as agents position themselves .",

    "consequently , the _ system failure _ probability can be expressed by eq . .",

    "in this situation , after reaching its maximum value , the estimates @xmath43 fell and ended up becoming negative for some time , which made @xmath18 ( that was positive ) decline and end up becoming zero in the sequence .",

    "as noise is uniformly distributed , its influence on @xmath43 ends up `` masking '' the agents temporary separation movement ( and the consequent @xmath18 descents ) to the connectivity maintenance algorithm as the obstacles region is crossed .",
