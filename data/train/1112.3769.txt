    "the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite is a powerful method for discovering new clusters of galaxies .",
    "it arises generically due to the scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons off free electrons , leading to a predictable spectral distortion in the cmb that is , in the non - relativistic limit , linearly dependent on the line integral of the electron pressure @xcite . in modern theories of structure formation ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the sz signal comes from the intracluster medium ( icm ) , a diffuse plasma within clusters that is approximately in hydrostatic equilibrium within the dark - matter dominated potential ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the key sz observable is the @xmath9 parameter , defined as @xmath10 where the integral is performed over the solid angle subtended by the cluster .",
    "the compton-@xmath11 parameter is determined by the thermal structure of the icm @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the density and temperature of the free electrons respectively and @xmath15 is the differential line element along the line - of - sight .",
    "since @xmath9 can be expressed as a volume integral of the pressure ( when the redshift and cosmological parameters are specified ) , it measures the total thermal energy of the gas , a property that ought to be strongly correlated with the cluster s mass through the virial theorem .",
    "this means that @xmath9 ought to be relatively insensitive to the complex micro - physics taking place in the cluster core , unlike other global properties such as x - ray luminosity .",
    "early observational studies confirmed the detection of an sz signal towards known massive clusters of galaxies and used this to estimate the hubble constant ( e.g. @xcite ) . over the past decade , sz observations of known bright x - ray bright clusters have become routine , allowing the investigation of cluster scaling relations to be performed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one potential shortcoming of this approach is that the samples are x - ray selected and therefore biased towards luminous , cool - core systems at low redshift .    in the past few years , sz science has entered the exciting new phase of blind surveys , where detections of new clusters have become possible @xcite . indeed , sz surveys are now yielding large numbers of sz - selected clusters , many of them new detections , especially from the south pole telescope ( spt ; @xcite ) , the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ; @xcite ) and the _ planck _ satellite @xcite .",
    "since the sz effect is effectively independent of redshift , the sz selection function tends to favour higher redshift systems than the x - ray counterpart , assuming similar angular resolution . as a result",
    ", the new blind sz surveys are starting to find new massive systems at @xmath16 @xcite . in the near future",
    ", we should expect to see these numbers increase substantially as the full survey results are published , nicely complementing x - ray surveys such as the massive cluster survey ( macs ; @xcite ) and the _ xmm _ cluster survey ( xcs ; @xcite ) .",
    "such complementarity will be further exploited with the next generation of x - ray surveys ( e.g. with erosita ) and millimetric telescopes ( e.g. ccat ; see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main goals of sz surveys is to measure cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "central to the cosmological application of sz surveys is the scaling relation between the observables ( @xmath9 and redshift , @xmath17 ) and cluster mass , @xmath18 . under the assumption that clusters form a self - similar population @xcite the sz flux should scale as @xmath19 , when measured within a radius enclosing a mean density that is a constant multiple of the critical density of the universe .",
    "early theoretical studies combined such simple scaling relations with the press - schechter formalism @xcite to predict the sz evolution of the cluster population in a variety of cosmological models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , attention has turned to more detailed studies of how cluster gas physics impacts upon sz scaling relations , both using semi - analytic models ( e.g. @xcite ) and full cosmological @xmath0-body / hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "simulations are now also being used to investigate the effects of mergers on sz scaling relations @xcite . a generic result from these studies",
    "is that the self - similar description appears to be approximately valid on cluster scales ( @xmath20 ) but in detail , differences are seen between the models that are due to the effects of non - gravitational physics ( cooling and heating processes ) , especially at low mass where the gas fraction is depleted .",
    "two of the main shortcomings in previous simulation studies are the relatively small samples ( that are sometimes restricted to lower - mass clusters ) and a limited range of ( uncertain ) cluster gas physics models , often not calibrated to match x - ray data .",
    "some studies may satisfy one of these criteria but usually not both .",
    "a new generation of simulations are now starting to overcome both shortcomings .",
    "@xcite recently presented results from two of the _ millennium gas _",
    "simulations @xcite , large - volume runs based on the millennium simulation @xcite with varying gas physics .",
    "these simulations are sufficiently large to enable the full range of cluster masses ( @xmath21 ) to be studied and one of the runs , where the gas was pre - heated at high redshift , is able to match the mean x - ray luminosity - temperature relation at @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "although the work of @xcite was focused on the more general issue of multi - variate scaling relations , they presented results for the sz @xmath23 relation measured within a radius corresponding to a mean internal density equal to 200 times the critical density , @xmath24 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to use these millennium gas simulations to focus in more detail on predictions of the sz effect and , in particular , the @xmath23 relation for clusters .",
    "our paper builds on the @xcite work in three important ways .",
    "firstly , we add a third model that includes a more realistic treatment of feedback , both from supernovae and active galactic nuclei .",
    "this model has already been shown to successfully match many of the x - ray properties of non - cool core clusters @xcite .",
    "secondly , we include in our analysis simulated maps of the full sz effect along the line - of - sight , to assess the projection effects of large - scale structure .",
    "finally , we attempt to produce results for our @xmath23 scaling relations using methods that are more closely matched with observations .",
    "in particular , we present our results for the smaller @xmath3 and investigate the impact of assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and a mass proxy ( @xmath25 , @xcite ) on the @xmath23 relation .",
    "we organise the remainder of the paper as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : simdetails ] we outline the simulation details and our methods used to define cluster properties .",
    "we also present some basic properties of the sample and sz maps .",
    "sections  [ sec : pressureprofiles ] , [ sec : scalingrelations ] and [ sec : hse ] contain our main results : in section  [ sec : pressureprofiles ] we present an analysis of the hot gas pressure profiles , before going on to study sz scaling relations in section  [ sec : scalingrelations ] and the impact of hydrostatic bias in section  [ sec : hse ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] we summarise our main conclusions and outline future work .",
    "our results are drawn from the millennium gas simulations , a set of large , cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of the @xmath26cdm cosmology ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) . in this section",
    "we summarise the details of these simulations and present our methods for constructing simulated cluster properties and sz sky maps .",
    "the millennium gas simulations ( hereafter mgs ; see @xcite ) were constructed to provide hydrodynamic versions of the virgo consortium s dark matter millennium simulation ( hereafter ms ; @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations were therefore started from the same realisation of the large - scale density field within the same comoving box - size , @xmath32 and used the same set of cosmological parameters .",
    "the mgs were run with the publicly - available gadget2 @xmath0-body / hydrodynamics code @xcite . due to the increased computational requirements from the inclusion of gas particles",
    ", the simulations were run with fewer ( @xmath33 each of gas and dark matter ) particles in total than the ms .",
    "the particle masses were therefore set to @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the gas and dark matter respectively .",
    "gravitational forces were softened at small separations using an equivalent plummer softening length of @xmath36 , held fixed in comoving co - ordinates . at low redshift ( @xmath37 ) the softening",
    "was then fixed to @xmath38 in physical co - ordinates .",
    "two versions of the mgs were run with the above properties .",
    "both runs started from identical initial conditions but differed in the way the gas was evolved .",
    "in the first run , the gas was modelled as an ideal non - radiative fluid .",
    "in addition to gravitational forces , the gas could undergo adiabatic changes in regions of non - zero pressure gradients , modelled using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics formalism ( sph ; see @xcite for the version of sph used in gadget2 ) .",
    "additionally , in regions where the flow was convergent the bulk kinetic energy of the gas is converted into internal energy using an artificial viscosity term ; this is essential to capture shocks and thus generate quasi - hydrostatic atmospheres within virialised dark matter haloes . in accord with previous studies",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) we refer to this simulation as the go ( _ gravitation only _ ) model .",
    "it is well known that a non - radiative description of intracluster gas does not agree with the observed x - ray properties of clusters , especially at low masses , where an excess of core entropy is required to produce a steeper x - ray luminosity - temperature relation ( e.g. @xcite ) . a simple method capable of generating this excess entropy is to _ pre - heat _ the gas at high redshift before cluster collapse @xcite . we implemented this method in a second simulation by raising the minimum entropy , where @xmath39 is the gas temperature and @xmath13 the free electron density .",
    "] of the gas ( by increasing its temperature ) to @xmath40 at @xmath41 .",
    "the entropy level was chosen so as to match the mean @xmath22 x - ray luminosity - temperature relation @xcite .",
    "we also included radiative cooling , an entropy sink . however , this made very little difference , as the cooling time of the pre - heated gas is very long compared to the hubble time and therefore gas could no longer cool and form stars before the end of the simulation .",
    "we refer to this simulation using the label pc , for _ pre - heating plus cooling_.    we also consider a third model when analysing the sz properties from individual clusters .",
    "this is the _ feedback only _ ( hereafter fo ) model developed by @xcite and then applied to mgs clusters by @xcite , where full details of the method may be found .",
    "briefly , it uses the semi - analytic galaxy formation model of @xcite , run on dark - matter - only resimulations of ms clusters , to provide information on the effects of star formation and feedback on the intracluster gas .",
    "the model works as follows .",
    "galaxy merger trees are first generated by applying the semi - analytic model to the dark matter distribution .",
    "various properties of the galaxies ( such as their position , stellar mass and black hole mass ) are stored at each snapshot of the simulation .",
    "the clusters are then re - simulated with gas , assuming that the gas particles have zero gravitational mass ; this guarantees that the dark matter distributions ( and therefore galaxy positions ) are identical to those in the parent dark - matter - only simulation . at each snapshot time",
    ", two important changes are made to the gas .",
    "firstly the increase in stellar mass of each cluster galaxy is used to convert local intracluster gas into stars , a requirement for generating sensible stellar and gas fractions @xcite . this change in stellar mass",
    "is also used to heat the gas from supernova explosions .",
    "secondly , any increase in black hole mass is used to heat the gas on the basis that such accretion leads to an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the heating rate , known as agn feedback , is taken from @xcite and is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 dictates the maximum heating rate ( in units of the eddington luminosity ) and @xmath44 is the efficiency with which the accreted mass is converted into feedback energy .",
    "this is particularly important because agn are the dominant feedback mechanism on cluster scales .",
    "we analyse the same sample of 337 clusters studied by @xcite , comprising all objects in the ms with virial mass @xmath45 and a random sample at lower mass ( @xmath46 ) chosen such that there were a fixed number of objects within each logarithmic mass bin .",
    "the fo model successfully generates the required excess entropy of the low redshift population and provides a good match to the structural properties of non - cool core clusters .",
    "the main shortcoming of this model is that it neglects the effects of radiative cooling and therefore can not reproduce the most x - ray luminous cool core population @xcite",
    ". this failure may not be as serious as it seems , however , since there is some evidence that the x - ray cool core population diminishes with increasing redshift , both from observations ( e.g. @xcite ) and simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , as we will demonstrate , the sz @xmath9 parameter ( which measures the global thermal energy of the intracluster gas ) is reasonably insensitive to changes in gas physics that predominantly affect the cluster core .",
    "issues relevant to this study where cooling could impact upon our results are the degree to which the icm is hydrostatic and the effect of gas clumping on the x - ray quantity , @xmath25 , used as a cluster mass proxy .",
    "we note that a first step towards including radiative cooling in the model has been made and shows promising results @xcite . ultimately , a fully self - consistent scheme is desirable , where the same cooling and heating rates are used in both the semi - analytic model and hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "clusters are defined in exactly the same way as in @xcite .",
    "firstly , a friends - of - friends code is run on the dark matter particles for each snapshot .",
    "the dimensionless linking length ( in units of the mean inter - particle separation ) is set to @xmath47 , chosen to minimise the probability of linking two haloes together outside of their respective virial radii .",
    "the dark matter particle with the most negative gravitational potential energy is then identified for each group and this is taken to be the centre .    in the next stage",
    ", a sphere is centred on each friends - of - friends group and its radius increased until the total mass ( from dark matter , gas and stars , when present ) satisfies @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the proper radius of the sphere , @xmath50 is a specified density contrast , @xmath51 is the critical density and @xmath52 for a flat universe .",
    "we assume @xmath53 for the main results in this study as this value is commonly adopted for observational studies ( some of which we will compare to ) because @xmath3 is sufficiently large to make many integrated properties insensitive to variations in core structure , while also being small enough to be within reach for detailed x - ray observations of many objects .",
    "we occasionally use the value of @xmath50 appropriate for the virial radius , @xmath54 , as defined by the spherical top - hat collapse model .",
    "this is a redshift - dependent quantity , @xmath55 , which we calculate using the fitting formula given by @xcite .",
    "note that at @xmath22 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "once the cluster s mass and radius is defined , we calculate various properties of the hot gas , the most important being the sz flux . the frequency independent part is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the ( cosmology - dependent ) angular diameter distance to the cluster and the integral is performed over the entire cluster sphere .",
    "to simplify matters , we re - define the integrated sz @xmath9 parameter @xmath60 since this combination is directly proportional to the integrated thermal energy of the gas which is the physical property of interest . note that",
    "the dimensions of @xmath7 are now that of area ; we will therefore present values in @xmath61 units .",
    "the value of @xmath7 is estimated for each cluster using @xmath62 where the sum runs over all hot ( @xmath63k ) gas particles within @xmath3 , with mass @xmath64 and temperature @xmath65 .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath66 for the mean molecular weight per free electron , appropriate for a fully ionised plasma of hydrogen ( with mass fraction @xmath67 ) and helium ( with mass fraction @xmath68 ) .",
    "we also assume equipartition of energy between the electrons and nuclei , thus @xmath69 .",
    "we estimate the x - ray temperature of the icm using the spectroscopic - like temperature @xmath70 @xcite , appropriate for bremsstrahlung in hot ( @xmath71 ) clusters @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the density of particle @xmath74 and in this case the sum runs over all hot gas particles with @xmath75kev .",
    "we measure @xmath70 in the region outside the cluster core ( @xmath76 , where @xmath77 for the go and pc models , and 0.15 for the fo model were made at those times .",
    "however , the effect of this difference on @xmath70 is small ; we checked by re - calculating the go / pc temperatures at @xmath22 using @xmath78 and found only a 2 - 3 per cent increase , on average . ] ) to provide a closer match to observed x - ray temperature measurements ( where a larger variation in core temperature is seen than in our simulations ) .",
    "a quantity related to @xmath7 is @xmath79 , estimated from x - ray data",
    ". introduced by @xcite , it was shown to be a low - scatter proxy for cluster mass ( due to scatter in x - ray temperature being negatively correlated with scatter in gas mass ) .",
    "we estimate this quantity as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the mass of hot gas within @xmath3 , although we occasionally present @xmath5 in its native ( @xmath82 ) units , i.e. simply assuming @xmath83 .",
    "the main difference between @xmath9 and @xmath25 is that the former depends on the mass - weighted temperature while the latter depends on the x - ray temperature , which is more heavily weighted by lower entropy gas @xcite . comparing @xmath9 with @xmath25",
    "therefore implicitly tests the _ clumpiness _ of the icm since clumpy gas will be cooler and therefore lower the x - ray temperature relative to the mass - weighted temperature ( e.g. @xcite ) . as we show below",
    ", this effect is model dependent but is of minimal importance in the pc and fo simulations .",
    ".number of clusters in our samples at redshifts , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "column 1 gives the model label and column 2 the redshift .",
    "column 3 lists the total number of clusters in each sample with @xmath86 , while columns 4 and 5 sub - divide the sample into the _ regular _ and _ disturbed _ populations respectively , using the @xmath87 parameter defined in equation  ( [ eqn : substat ] ) . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : ymrelhse ]    in the previous section , we saw that our pc and fo models produced sz / x - ray scaling relations that were in good agreement with the pxmm observational data .",
    "a significant uncertainty in the observational determination of scaling relations is the ( direct or indirect ) assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) , required for deriving the cluster mass ( @xmath4 ) and radius ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to look at the accuracy of this assumption in our simulations as the good agreement between our results and the observations can only be preserved if hydrostatic bias is small ( in the absence of additional systematic effects ) .    for a cluster in hse ,",
    "the pressure gradient in the icm is sufficient to balance gravity ; the total mass of the cluster can then be calculated as @xmath88 \\label{eqn : hse}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the mean molecular weight for an ionised plasma ( assuming zero metallicity ) .",
    "we use the spectroscopic - like temperature to evaluate the local temperature , @xmath90 and its gradient , @xmath91 , at radius , @xmath92 .",
    "estimation of the cluster mass based on hydrostatic equilibrium can be biased for three reasons .",
    "firstly , the estimated mass within a fixed radius can be different from the true mass because the intracluster gas is not perfectly hydrostatic .",
    "previous simulations have shown that mass estimates can be too low by up to 20 per cent , due to incomplete thermalisation of the gas ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a second effect is that the x - ray temperature of the gas may be lower than the mean ( mass - weighted ) temperature .",
    "such an effect depends on the thermal structure of the gas ( in particular , the low entropy tail associated with substructure ) and can be particularly severe when radiative cooling effects are strong .",
    "finally , the cluster s size itself is usually defined as a scale radius ( e.g. @xmath3 ) which is mass - dependent so also depends on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium .    to study how these combined effects impact upon our scaling relations , we estimate the hydrostatic mass of each cluster as follows .",
    "firstly , we compute the hot gas ( @xmath93 ) density and temperature profiles . in lower mass clusters",
    "the profiles can get rather noisy due to limited particle numbers which can affect the estimation of the pressure gradient . to avoid this , we fit a cubic polynomial function to each profile ( in log space ) to generate a smoothed representation .",
    "( this also has the advantage that the gradient can be derived analytically . )",
    "we then use these model profiles to estimate the mass , @xmath94 , using equation  ( [ eqn : hse ] ) , then vary the radius , @xmath92 , until the following equation is satisfied @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are our estimated mass and radius respectively .",
    "once the radius is known we can use this to estimate the sz flux which we will denote @xmath98 .",
    "again , this is the flux from within a sphere centred on the cluster ; all that has changed is the assumed value of @xmath3 . in what follows ,",
    "we only consider the sub - set of clusters in the estimated mass range , @xmath99 .",
    "the numbers of clusters are listed for each model and redshift in table  [ tab : ymrelhse ] .",
    ", within the estimated @xmath3 for clusters at @xmath100 ( left panels ) and @xmath22 ( right panels ) .",
    "the top panels show results from the go model , middle panels from pc and bottom panels from fo .",
    "the green histogram is for the whole cluster sample while the blue histogram is for the disturbed sub - sample .",
    "vertical dashed lines indicate the median mass ratio for each case , with values given in the legend .",
    "the median @xmath101 is significantly smaller in the runs with non - gravitational heating.,width=321 ]    we quantify the effect of the hydrostatic assumption on cluster mass by considering the distribution of the estimated - to - true mass ratio , @xmath102 , for our models at @xmath100 and @xmath22 .",
    "( note that @xmath101 directly measures the resulting shift along the logarithmic mass axis . )",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhseratio ] .    at @xmath22 ,",
    "the go results show a significant spread in mass ratios as well as a large negative bias ; the median value is @xmath103 . in the pc and fo models ,",
    "the spread and bias is smaller , with the median increasing to around @xmath104 .",
    "a similar situation is evident at @xmath100 .",
    "the disturbed sub - sample , where hse should definitely not be a good approximation , shows a small offset in the median @xmath101 from the overall sample ; in the pc and fo cases the offset is positive whereas in the go case it is negative .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that the discrepancy between estimated and true mass from the go simulation is significantly higher than for the pc and fo models . as is evident from the @xmath105 relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : yyxrelz ] ) , the former model predicts a more clumpy intracluster medium due to the persistence of low entropy gas that is unable to cool .",
    "this gas by its very nature has not completely thermalised to the global cluster temperature and has significant residual bulk kinetic energy . in the latter",
    "two runs , the non - gravitational heating generates a smoother distribution that is evidently closer to hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "but for the ratio of estimated - to - true @xmath7 values , @xmath106 .",
    "the difference in @xmath107 is very small in the runs with non - gravitational heating.,width=321 ]    the use of hydrostatic mass estimates also affects the sz flux through the use of @xmath97 to define the cluster radius ; a smaller radius will result in a lower value for @xmath9 .",
    "we define a similar quantity to the mass ratio , @xmath108 , and present the distribution of values in fig .",
    "[ fig : yhseratio ] .",
    "again , we present the ratio in this way as it directly gives the shift in @xmath109 values due to the hydrostatic estimate .    as was the case with the total mass estimates , there is a larger bias ( and scatter ) in the @xmath7 values for the go run but the overall effect is smaller as it is entirely due to the ( small ) shift in @xmath3 .",
    "the median @xmath106 is @xmath110 for go at @xmath22 , increasing to only @xmath111 for the pc and fo runs .",
    "since @xmath112 on average , the integrated flux is also smaller .",

    "[ fig : y500m500hse ] , where the best - fit relation is offset to larger @xmath7 values for a given value of @xmath96 .",
    "the large spread in the @xmath101 distribution is also evident as the scatter has increased significantly ( @xmath117 , c.f .",
    "[ fig : ymrelz10 ] where @xmath2 ) .",
    "the offset is insensitive to mass in this model , resulting in a relation that has similar slope ( 1.6 ) to the true @xmath1 relation .",
    "the offset in normalisation has also led to a significant drop in the number of clusters in the sample at each redshift ; as a result there are only 98 clusters at @xmath100 , making a reliable estimate of the relation difficult ( but the trends are nevertheless consistent with those seen at @xmath22 ) .",
    "the best - fit @xmath113 relation from the pc run at @xmath22 is remarkably similar to the underlying relation , although the scatter has also increased considerably to @xmath118 .",
    "results at @xmath100 prefer a flatter slope but this is somewhat affected by a few higher mass clusters ( the slope is @xmath119 ) .",
    "the estimated relation for the fo model is also similar to the true relation , with a preference for a slightly flatter slope and larger scatter ( @xmath120 at @xmath22 ) .",
    "the disturbed cluster sub - sample is most strongly biased in the pc results at @xmath22 , where the clusters have larger hse masses for their flux , relative to the regular systems .",
    "when mass estimates are required for larger samples of clusters , the direct hydrostatic method discussed above can be prohibitively expensive as it requires the density and temperature profiles to be known out to @xmath3 and beyond .",
    "an alternative , indirect method is to use a mass _ proxy _ , where mass is estimated from a mass - observable scaling relation that is pre - calibrated using fewer clusters .",
    "historically , @xmath121 was the observable of choice but recent studies have focussed on the use of @xmath25 due to its low scatter ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the planck collaboration @xcite made use of the @xmath122 relation , calibrated by @xcite from the rexcess sample of 33 clusters , to estimate @xmath3 and @xmath4 for their larger ( pxmm ) sample of 62 clusters .    the procedure for estimating @xmath4 works as follows .",
    "assuming that all clusters lie on an @xmath122 relation and that they evolve self - similarly with redshift , then @xmath3 may be found using @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a known constant and @xmath125 is the best - fit value of @xmath126 from the scaling relation for a given @xmath5 .",
    "the mass , @xmath127 , can then be estimated using equation  ( [ eqn : m500hse ] ) . in practice",
    ", this equation must be solved iteratively : a value for @xmath3 is first guessed then @xmath5 is calculated within this radius ( from the integrated gas mass and average x - ray temperature ) , allowing a new value for @xmath3 to be computed from equation  ( [ eqn : r500yx ] ) .",
    "this is repeated until convergence is achieved . since clusters do not all lie on this relation ( even though this particular relation is chosen for its low scatter )",
    "the derived @xmath3 may be inaccurate for an individual cluster , but the overall relation should be unbiased .",
    "but for the @xmath128 relation .",

    "data as found by @xcite.,width=321 ]    we have applied this procedure to our simulated clusters and will refer to the resulting @xmath1 relation as the @xmath130 relation .",
    "we first show our derived @xmath131 relations , required for equation  ( [ eqn : r500yx ] ) , for the three models at @xmath100 and @xmath22 in fig .",
    "[ fig : m500yx500hse ] .",
    "since @xmath25 ( and not mass ) is on the @xmath132-axis , we restrict our fits to clusters with @xmath133 , as this approximately matches our adopted mass range ( @xmath134 ) for the pc and fo models .",
    "qualitatively , the same conclusions can be drawn as for the @xmath113 relation ( fig .",

    "the pc and fo models agree well with the observational data although there is a slight offset .",
    "the scatter is much lower , however , due to the strong correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath5.,width=321 ]    the derived @xmath130 relations are shown in fig .  [ fig : y500m500myx ] .",
    "we have overlaid the best - fit relation to these data ( solid line ) ; the best - fit true @xmath1 relation ( dashed line ) ; the best - fit @xmath113 relation ( triple - dot - dashed line ) ; and the best - fit relation to the pxmm observational data ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the final result is very striking for our pc and fo models . at @xmath22",
    ", there is only a small amount of bias ( around 20 per cent or so , or @xmath138 ) with respect to the underlying relation ( and also , the pxmm relation ) .",
    "such an offset , comparable to the estimated intrinsic scatter in the observed relation , is small enough that it may just reflect our method not exactly matching that used by the planck collaboration .",
    "even more striking is the reduction in scatter ; @xmath6 for the pc and fo models at @xmath22 , about half the size of the scatter in the true @xmath1 relation .",
    "the reason for this reduction is obvious : from fig .",
    "[ fig : yyxrelz ] we saw that @xmath7 and @xmath5 were strongly correlated , especially in the pc and fo models .",
    "thus , a cluster that has a larger - than - average @xmath5 for its mass will also have a larger - than - average @xmath7 .",
    "this was also true for the disturbed sub - sample hence the reason why these clusters are unbiased with respect to the overall sample .",
    "large surveys are now being performed at millimetre wavelengths exploiting the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect to detect large samples of galaxy clusters out to high redshift .",
    "such samples will then be used to produce competitive constraints on cosmological parameters , as well as to study the variation in physical properties of the intracluster gas ( especially the gas pressure ) with mass and redshift .",
    "the cosmological application relies on the statistical estimation of cluster mass through the sz @xmath23 relation . in recent work (",
    "e.g. @xcite ) the first sz - selected samples of clusters have already been used to estimate the cluster @xmath23 relation and full results of cosmological analyses are expected over the next few years .    in this paper , we have analysed some of the largest @xmath0-body / hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation ( the millennium gas simulations ) to study the dependence of sz cluster properties on gas physics , at both low ( @xmath22 ) and high ( @xmath100 ) redshift .",
    "the large volume used in these simulations produces significant ( hundreds to thousands ) samples of clusters over the interesting range of cluster masses ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we considered three cluster gas physics models : a non - radiative ( gravitational heating only ) simulation that ought to produce an approximately self - similar cluster population ; and two simulations that incorporate additional non - gravitational heating ( a model that uniformly pre - heats the gas at high redshift and a model that includes feedback from stars and active galactic nuclei in galaxies ) .",
    "the feedback model is our most realistic , in that it has already been shown to reproduce many of the scaling properties of x - ray clusters , especially those with non - cool cores @xcite .",
    "we started by investigating the hot gas pressure profiles of our simulated clusters and how they compare to the pressure profile advocated by @xcite .",
    "we then compared our derived sz scaling relations ( between @xmath7 and total mass , hot gas mass , x - ray temperature and the x - ray analogue to the sz @xmath9 parameter , @xmath25 ) with the recent observational results , in particular those obtained from a combined sz+x - ray analysis performed by the planck collaboration .",
    "we also tested two of the key assumptions used in the observed analysis , namely that the mean @xmath1 relation is unaffected by the assumption that the gas is hydrostatic and by the presence of any other hot gas along the line - of - sight .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarised as follows :    * in accord with previous studies , our simulation with non - radiative hydrodynamics produces a ( spherical ) @xmath1 relation that has a self - similar slope ( 5/3 ) and also evolves with redshift according to the self - similar expectation , @xmath139 .",
    "simulations with non - gravitational heating ( both pre - heating and feedback cases ) create slightly steeper @xmath1 relations ( with a slope of @xmath140 , when clusters across the mass range , @xmath141 , are considered ) but the evolution with redshift is still close to self - similar . *",
    "the simulations were compared with the _ planck+xmm _ results at @xmath137 @xcite and very good agreement was found for a number of scaling relations ( @xmath7 versus @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) for the pre - heating and feedback models .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath1 relation is smaller than observed , however , with @xmath2 .",
    "* intracluster gas in the non - radiative simulation contains a significant unthermalised component , due to the presence of low - entropy , clumpy gas .",
    "this causes an offset in the @xmath105 relation , which tests the difference between the mass - weighted and x - ray temperatures . as a result , hydrostatic mass estimates are biased low by 20 - 30 per cent .",
    "the pre - heating and feedback simulations on the other hand predict smoother gas distributions , with @xmath144 and much smaller hydrostatic bias ( estimated masses are only @xmath145 per cent lower ) . *",
    "the estimated @xmath122 relations ( assuming the gas is hydrostatic ) are in good agreement with the recent observational determination by @xcite . when @xmath5 is used as a mass proxy to predict the sz @xmath1 relation , only a small ( @xmath146 per cent ) offset in normalisation from the true relation ( and thus the observed relation from _",
    "data ) is found .",
    "the scatter in the recovered relation is very small ( @xmath6 ) due to the strong correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath5 .",
    "clusters that are undergoing major mergers are not significantly offset from the mean relation .",
    "* hot gas pressure profiles are well described by generalised nfw profiles , as suggested by @xcite and show that the majority of the contribution to the sz @xmath9 parameter ( where @xmath147 is maximal ) comes from radii close to @xmath3 . splitting the cluster samples into low and high - mass sub - samples , we find little difference between the two in the run with non - radiative hydrodynamics , as expected .",
    "the runs with non - gravitational heating predict that low - mass clusters have lower core pressures and higher pressures in the cluster outskirts , when scaled according to the self - similar expectation .",
    "this non - self - similar - behaviour can be attributed to the heating that is more effective in low - mass clusters and acts to push the gas out to large radii .",
    "there is also significant cluster - cluster scatter , especially in the core region and in the outskirts , where individiual pressure profiles can be 50 per cent higher than the median profile .",
    "* we also compared our median pressure profiles with the arnaud et al .",
    "profile and found good agreement ( within 10 per cent ) for our high - mass clusters at @xmath148 , in the pre - heating and feedback models .",
    "low - mass clusters are especially discrepant in the core regions , likely due to the absence of radiative cooling in our models . using the x - ray temperature ( rather than hot gas mass - weighted temperature ) in the pressure calculation , as well as using hydrostatic estimates of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ,",
    "only makes a significant ( @xmath149 per cent ) difference to the non - radiative simulation for the reasons already mentioned .",
    "* finally , we considered the effects of projection due to large - scale structure along the line - of - sight , by analysing 50 @xmath8 maps of the thermal sz effect . by measuring the cylindrical sz flux associated with each cluster and comparing to the flux from the cluster region alone , we were able to discern the contribution from additional structures , in the non - radiative and pre - heating simulations .",
    "the pre - heating model showed the largest bias , where low - mass clusters ( @xmath150 ) had cylindrical @xmath7 values that were around 2 - 3 times higher than the value from the cluster region .",
    "this is due to the large amount of thermal energy injected into the gas at high redshift , as evidenced by the three - fold increase in the mean-@xmath11 parameter . subtracting the contribution from an assumed mean background we find the recovered @xmath1 relation to be unbiased with respect to the cluster relation , with some additional scatter that is model - dependent .    in summary",
    ", we can conclude that when our more realistic models for the intracluster gas are employed ( namely those that raise the entropy of the gas to match global x - ray scaling relations ) , the sz @xmath23 relation is in good agreement with the observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ymrelz10 ] ) and is largely unaffected by two of the main sources of systematic uncertainty : hydrostatic bias ( figs .  [",
    "fig : y500m500hse ] and [ fig : y500m500myx ] ) and projection effects from large - scale structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : y500m500cylbsub ] ) .",
    "while our analysis has been one of the most comprehensive to date and used some of the largest and most sophisticated simulation models , there are some significant shortcomings that still need to be addressed .",
    "firstly , the effects of radiative cooling were not included in our most realistic ( feedback ) model , so the model can not yet match the full x - ray cluster population ( namely the brightest objects with cool cores , @xcite ) . as we argued , this omission is likely not a significant problem for the @xmath23 relation but will affect the hot gas pressure profile so it should be addressed in future work . secondly , we were unable to test projection effects for the feedback model as we only have a sample of clusters rather than the full cosmological volume .",
    "finally , the cosmological model adopted for the simulations ( identical to that used in the original millennium simulation ) is no longer favoured ; in particular the value of @xmath151 is higher than the current best estimate ( @xmath31 in the simulations , c.f .",
    "@xmath152 from the _ wmap _ 7-year data ; @xcite ) . using",
    "the presently - favoured cosmological model is likely to reduce the scale of projection effects , however , as in it structure formation will be less advanced .",
    "we are currently preparing a new generation of millennium gas simulations that will rectify all of these problems , starting with a new version of our existing feedback model that will deal with the second and third issues .",
    "this new simulation , which is also being run at higher resolution and with an updated semi - analytic galaxy formation model @xcite , will additionally allow cosmologically - dependent statistical predictions for the sz signal to be performed , namely the sz power spectrum .",

    "<S> large surveys using the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect to find clusters of galaxies are now starting to yield large numbers of systems out to high redshift , many of which are new discoveries . in order to provide theoretical interpretation for the release of the full sz cluster samples over the next few years , </S>",
    "<S> we have exploited the large - volume millennium gas cosmological @xmath0-body hydrodynamics simulations to study the sz cluster population at low and high redshift , for three models with varying gas physics . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm previous results using smaller samples that the intrinsic ( spherical ) @xmath1 relation has very little scatter ( @xmath2 ) , is insensitive to cluster gas physics and evolves to redshift one in accord with self - similar expectations . </S>",
    "<S> our _ pre - heating _ and _ feedback _ models predict scaling relations that are in excellent agreement with the recent analysis from combined _ planck _ and _ xmm - newton _ </S>",
    "<S> data by the planck collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement is largely preserved when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are derived using the hydrostatic mass proxy , @xmath5 , albeit with significantly reduced scatter ( @xmath6 ) , a result that is due to the tight correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this assumption also hides any bias in the relation due to dynamical activity . </S>",
    "<S> we also assess the importance of projection effects from large - scale structure along the line - of - sight , by extracting cluster @xmath7 values from fifty simulated @xmath8 sky maps . </S>",
    "<S> once the ( model - dependent ) mean signal is subtracted from the maps we find that the integrated sz signal is unbiased with respect to the underlying clusters , although the scatter in the ( cylindrical ) @xmath1 relation increases in the _ pre - heating _ case , where a significant amount of energy was injected into the intergalactic medium at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study the hot gas pressure profiles to investigate the origin of the sz signal and find that the largest contribution comes from radii close to @xmath3 in all cases . </S>",
    "<S> the profiles themselves are well described by generalised navarro , frenk & white profiles but there is significant cluster - to - cluster scatter . in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our results support the notion that @xmath7 is a robust mass proxy for use in cosmological analyses with clusters .    </S>",
