    "in waveform communication systems , the information is normally conveyed in a real  valued parameter ( or parameters ) of a continuous  time signal to be transmitted , whereas the receiver is based on estimating this parameter from a noisy received version of this signal ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "this concept of mapping a real  valued parameter , or a parameter vector , into a continuous  time signal , using a certain modulation scheme , stands at the basis of the theory and practice of shannon ",
    "kotelnikov mappings , which can in turn be viewed as certain families of joint source  channel codes ( see , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite as well as many references therein ) .",
    "when the underlying modulation scheme is highly non  linear , like in frequency modulation ( fm ) , phase modulation ( pm ) , pulse position modulation ( ppm ) , or frequency position modulation ( fpm ) , it is well known that the estimation of the desired parameter is subjected to a _",
    "threshold effect_. this threshold effect means that the wider is the bandwidth of the transmitted signal , the better is the accuracy of the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimator at the high signal  to  noise ratio ( snr ) regime , but on the other hand , it comes at the price of increasing also a certain critical level of the snr , referred to as the _ threshold snr _ , below which this estimator breaks down .",
    "this breakdown means that the estimator makes gross errors ( a.k.a .",
    "anomalous errors ) with an overwhelmingly large probability , and in the high bandwidth regime , this breakdown becomes abrupt , as the snr crosses the threshold value .",
    "this threshold effect is not merely an artifact to be attributed to a specific modulator and/or estimation method .",
    "it is a fundamental limitation which is inherent to any ( non  linear ) communication system operating under a limited power constraint over a wide - band channel .    in this paper , we propose a statistical  mechanical perspective on the threshold effect .",
    "according to this perspective , the abrupt threshold effect of the wide - band regime is viewed as a _ phase transition _ of a certain disordered physical system of interacting particles .",
    "specifically , this physical system turns out to be closely related ( though not quite identical ) to a well  known model in the statistical physics literature , which is called the _ random energy model _ ( rem ) .",
    "the rem is one model ( among many other models ) for highly disordered magnetic materials , called _",
    "spin glasses_. the rem was invented by derrida in the early eighties of the previous century @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and it was shown more recently in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  6 ) ( see also @xcite ) to be intimately related to phase transitions in the behavior of ensembles of random channel codes , not merely in the context of ordinary digital decoding , but also in minimum mean square error ( mmse ) signal estimation @xcite .",
    "this paper , in contrast to @xcite , examines the physics of the threshold effect in the estimation of a continuous  valued parameter , rather than the estimation of the signal itself . for the sake of simplicity and concreteness ,",
    "the analogy between the threshold effect and phase transitions is demonstrated in the context of estimating the delay ( or the position ) of a narrow rectangular pulse , but the methodology is generalizable to other situations , as discussed in the sequel . a phase diagram with three phases ( similarly as in @xcite )",
    "is obtained in the plane of two design parameters of the communication system , one pertaining to the signal bandwidth , and the other to a certain notion of temperature ( which will be made clear in the sequel ) .    beyond the fact that this relationship , between the threshold effect in parameter estimation and phase transitions in physics , may be interesting on its own right , we also believe that the physical point of view may provide insights and tools for understanding the interactions and the collective behavior of the joint ml estimators of two or more parameters , in the context of the threshold effect . for example , suppose that both the amplitude and the delay of a narrow pulse are to be estimated . while the amplitude estimation alone does not exhibit any threshold effect ( as the modulation is linear ) and the delay estimation alone displays a phase diagram with three phases , it turns out that when joint ml estimation of both amplitude and delay is considered , the interaction between them exhibits a surprisingly more erratic behavior , than that of the delay parameter alone : it possesses as many as five different phases in the plane of bandwidth vs.  temperature . moreover , the behavior of the anomalous errors ( below the threshold ) pertaining to the amplitude and the delay are very different in character , and it is the physical point of view that gives rise to understanding them .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ bcgd ]",
    ", we provide some basic background on the threshold effect in non  linear modulation and estimation . in section [ phys ] ,",
    "we present the threshold effect from the physics viewpoint and , in particular , we show how it is related to phase transitions pertaining to the rem . in section [ joint ] , we consider joint ml estimation of amplitude and delay , as described in the previous paragraph , and provide the phase diagram",
    ". finally , in section [ conc ] , we summarize and conclude this work .",
    "we begin with some basic background on ml parameter estimation for non  linearly modulated signals in additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) , the threshold effect pertaining to this estimation , and then the signal design problem , first , for band  limited signals , and then in large bandwidth limit .",
    "the material in this section , which is mostly classical and can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "8) , is briefly reviewed here merely for the sake of completeness and convenience of the reader .",
    "consider the following estimation problem .",
    "we are given a parametric family of waveforms @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the parameter , which for convenience , will be assumed a ( deterministic ) scalar that takes on values in some interval @xmath2 $ ] , ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "now suppose that we observe a noisy version of @xmath4 along the time interval @xmath5 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a zero  mean gaussian white noise with spectral density @xmath8 , and we wish to estimate @xmath1 from @xmath9 .",
    "maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation , in the gaussian case considered here , is obviously equivalent to the minimization of @xmath10 ^ 2{\\mbox{d}}t\\ ] ] w.r.t .",
    "the simplest example is the one where the parametrization of the signal is linear in @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a given waveform ( independent of @xmath1 ) . in this case , ml estimation yields @xmath13 where @xmath14 designates the energy of @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 , and mean square error ( mse ) is readily obtained as @xmath17 the estimation performance depends on the signal @xmath15 only via its energy , @xmath14 . since this mse achieves the cramr ",
    "rao lower bound , this is essentially the best one can do ( at least as far as unbiased estimators go ) with linear parametrization , for a given snr @xmath18 .",
    "the only way then to improve on this result , at least for very large snr , is to extend the scope to non  linear parametrizations of @xmath19 .",
    "for example , @xmath1 can stand for the _ delay _ ( or the _ position _ ) of a given pulse @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "also , in the case of a sinusoidal waveform , @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 being fixed parameters ) , @xmath1 can designate a frequency offset , as in @xmath26 $ ] , or a phase offset as in @xmath27 . in these examples , the mse in the high snr regime , depends not only on the snr , @xmath18 , but also on the shape of the waveform , i.e. , on some notion of bandwidth : rapidly varying signals can be estimated more accurately than slowly varying ones . to demonstrate this ,",
    "let us assume that the noise is very weak , and the true parameter is @xmath28 . for small deviations from @xmath29 , we consider the linearization @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "this is then essentially the same linear model as before where the previous role of @xmath15 is played now by @xmath32 , and so , the mse is about @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the energy of @xmath32 , which depends , of course , not only on @xmath14 , but also on the shape of @xmath19 .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 is a delay parameter , @xmath21 , and @xmath15 contains a narrow pulse ( or pulses ) compared to @xmath35 , then @xmath36 , essentially independently of @xmath1 , where @xmath37 is the time derivative of @xmath20 . by the parseval theorem , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the fourier transform of @xmath15 , and so ,",
    "we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the effective bandwidth of @xmath20 in the second moment sense , a.k.a .  the _",
    "gabor bandwidth_. we then have @xmath42 which means that mse depends , not only on @xmath18 , but also on the signal shape  in this case , its gabor bandwidth , @xmath41 .",
    "one might be tempted to think that the larger is @xmath41 , the better is the mse .",
    "however , there is a price for increasing @xmath41 : the probability of _ anomalous errors _ increases .",
    "to understand the effect of anomaly , it is instructive to look at the broader picture : let us assume that the parametric family of signals @xmath43 lies in the linear space spanned by a set of @xmath44 orthonormal basis functions @xmath45 , defined over @xmath46 , and so , we can pass from continuous time signals to vectors of coefficients : @xmath47 with @xmath48 and let us apply similar decompositions to @xmath49 and @xmath50 , so as to obtain vectors of coefficients @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , related by @xmath53 where @xmath54 , or @xmath55 as in the example of a delay parameter , let us assume that both the energy @xmath14 of the signal @xmath19 itself , and the energy @xmath34 of its derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath56 , are fixed , independently of @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , @xmath57 and @xmath58 for all @xmath1 . consider the locus of the signal vectors @xmath59 $ ] in @xmath60 as @xmath1 varies from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "on the one hand , this locus is constrained to lie on the hyper - surface of an @xmath44dimensional sphere of radius @xmath63 , on the other hand , since the high  snr mse behaves according to @xmath64 , we would like @xmath65 to be as large as possible . but @xmath34 is related to the length @xmath66 of the signal locus in @xmath60 according to @xmath67 where we have used the assumption that the norm of @xmath68 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the high  snr mse is about @xmath69 which means that we would like to make the signal locus as long as possible , in order to minimize the high  snr mse .",
    "our problem is then to design a signal locus , as long as possible , which lies in the hyper - surface of a @xmath44dimensional sphere of radius @xmath63 .",
    "since our room is limited by this energy constraint , a long locus would mean that it is very curvy , with many sharp foldings , and there must then be pairs of points @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which are far apart , yet @xmath72 and @xmath73 are close in the euclidean distance sense . in this case , if the noise vector @xmath74 has a sufficiently large projection in the direction of @xmath75 , it can cause a gross error , confusing @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , in high dimension @xmath44 , there can be much more than one such problematic ( orthogonal ) direction in the above described sense and then the event of anomalous error , which is the event that the noise projection is large in at least one of these directions , gains an appreciably large probability .",
    "thus , as the locus of @xmath76 bends , various folds of the curve must be kept sufficiently far apart in all dimensions , so that the noise can not cause anomalous errors with high probability .",
    "the probability of anomaly then sets the limit on the length of the curve , and hence also on the high snr mse .",
    "the maximum locus length @xmath66 is shown in @xcite to grow exponentially at the rate of @xmath77 in the large @xmath35 limit , where @xmath78 is the capacity of the infinite  bandwidth awgn channel , given by @xmath79 , with @xmath80 being the signal power .",
    "this maximum is essentially attained by the family _ frequency  position modulation _ ( fpm ) signals ( see @xcite ) , as well as by _ pulse  position modulation _ ( ppm ) signals , considered hereafter .    as is shown in (",
    "8) , if the signal space is spanned by @xmath81 dimensions of signals of duration @xmath35 and fixed bandwidth @xmath41 , namely , @xmath44 grows linearly with @xmath35 for fixed @xmath41 , the probability of anomaly is about @xmath82 , and so , the total mse behaves ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 8.100 ) , p.  633 ) ) roughly according to @xmath83 where @xmath84 is some constant , the first term accounts for the high  snr mse , and the second term is the mse dictated by the probability of an anomalous error . note that here the degradation contributed by the anomalous error , as a function of @xmath85 , is graceful , in other words , there is still no sharp breakdown of the kind that was described in the previous paragraph .",
    "this is because of the fact that as long as @xmath41 is fixed , the @xmath86 orthonormal basis functions may capture only a very small fraction of the ` problematic directions ' ( as described in the previous paragraph ) of the entire plethora of ` directions ' of the noise , which is of infinite bandwidth . in other words , since the probability of a large noise projection in a certain direction is exponentially small , it takes exponentially many directions to make the probability of a large projection in _ at least _ one of them , considerably large . as the energies @xmath14 and @xmath34 , grow linearly with @xmath35 ( for fixed power and bandwidth ) , the first term in ( [ totalmse ] ) is proportional to @xmath87 while the second term decays exponentially in @xmath35 .",
    "a natural question that arises then is whether there may be better trade - offs .",
    "the answer is affirmative if @xmath41 would be allowed to grow ( exponentially fast ) with @xmath35 . assuming then that @xmath88 for some fixed parameter @xmath89",
    ", the first term would then decay at the rate of @xmath90 whereas the second term may still continue to decay exponentially as long as @xmath91 is not too large .",
    "the exact behavior depends , of course , on the form of the parametric family of signals @xmath19 , but for some classes of signals like those pertaining to fpm , it is shown in @xcite that the probability of anomaly decays according to @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the error exponent function pertaining to infinite ",
    "bandwidth orthogonal signals over the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , i.e. , @xmath94 note that the best compromise between high - snr mse and anomalous mse pertains to the solution to the equation @xmath95 , namely , @xmath96 .",
    "for @xmath97 , the probability of anomaly tends to @xmath98 as @xmath99 .",
    "thus , we observe that in the regime of unlimited bandwidth , the threshold effect pertaining to anomalous errors is indeed sharp , while in the band  limited case , it is not .",
    "our purpose , in this work , is to study the threshold effect of anomalous errors , in the unlimited bandwidth regime , from a physical point of view , by relating the threshold effect to _ phase transitions _ of large physical systems subjected to disorder , in particular , a rem  like model , as described in the introduction .",
    "the limit of large @xmath35 would then correspond to the thermodynamic limit of a large system , customarily considered in statistical physics .",
    "moreover , as discussed earlier , the physical point of view will help us to understand situations where there is more than one phase transition .",
    "for the sake of concreteness , we consider the case where the parameter @xmath1 is time delay , defined in units of @xmath35 .",
    "let then @xmath100 we will also assume that the signal autocorrelation function , i.e. , @xmath101 vanishes outside the interval @xmath102 $ ] . in this case , it is natural to define the anomalous error event as the event where the absolute value of the estimation error , @xmath103 , exceeds @xmath104 .",
    "since the signal energy is @xmath14 , then so is @xmath105 . assuming that the signal support lies entirely within the interval @xmath5 $ ] for all allowable values of @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath106 )",
    ", the energy of @xmath107 is independent of @xmath1 , and then maximum likelihood estimation is equivalent to maximum correlation : @xmath108 if one treats @xmath1 as a uniformly distributed random variable , the corresponding posterior density of @xmath1 given @xmath109 is given by @xmath110 ^ 2\\mbox{d}t\\right\\ } } { \\int_{-m}^{+m}\\mbox{d}m'\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{n_0 } \\int_{-t/2}^{+t/2}[r(t)-s(t - m't)]^2\\mbox{d}t\\right\\}}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\exp\\left\\{\\frac{2}{n_0 } \\int_{-t/2}^{+t/2}r(t)s(t - mt)\\mbox{d}t\\right\\ } } { \\int_{-m}^{+m}\\mbox{d}m'\\exp \\left\\{\\frac{2}{n_0}\\int_{-t/2}^{+t/2}r(t)s(t - m't)\\mbox{d}t\\right\\}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the second equality , we have cancelled out the factor @xmath111 , which appears both in the numerator and the denominator , and we have used again the fact that the energy , @xmath14 , of @xmath107 is independent of @xmath1 . owing to the exponential form of this posterior distribution , it can be thought of , in the language of statistical mechanics , as the boltzmann distribution with inverse temperature @xmath112 and hamiltonian ( i.e. , energy as a function of @xmath1 ) : @xmath113 this statistical  mechanical point of view suggests to expand the scope and define a family of probability distributions parametrized by @xmath114 , as follows : @xmath115 there are at least three meaningful choices of the value of the parameter @xmath114 : the first is @xmath116 , corresponding to the uniform distribution on @xmath2 $ ] , which is the prior .",
    "the second choice is @xmath112 , which corresponds to the true posterior distribution , as said . finally , as @xmath117 , the density @xmath118 puts more and more weight on the value of @xmath1 that maximizes the correlation @xmath119 , namely , on the ml estimator @xmath120 .",
    "it should be emphasized that if we vary the parameter @xmath114 , this is not necessarily equivalent to a corresponding variation in the choice of @xmath85 , according to @xmath112 .",
    "for example , one may examine the behavior of the ml estimator by letting @xmath117 , but still analyze its performance for a given finite value of @xmath85 .",
    "this is to say that @xmath118 should only be thought of as an _ auxiliary _ posterior density function , not as the real one .",
    "the denominator of @xmath121 , namely , @xmath122 can then be thought of as the partition function pertaining to the boltzmann distribution @xmath118 .",
    "now , without essential loss of generality , let us assume that the true parameter value is @xmath123 , that @xmath104 divides @xmath124 , and that the integer @xmath125 is an even number .",
    "consider the partition of the interval @xmath2 $ ] of possible values of @xmath1 into sub - intervals of size @xmath126 .",
    "let @xmath127 denote the @xmath128th sub - interval , @xmath129",
    ". we will find it convenient to view the ml estimation of @xmath1 as a two  step procedure , where one first maximizes the correlation @xmath119 within each sub - interval @xmath130 , i.e. , calculate @xmath131 and then take the largest maximum over all @xmath128 .",
    "let us define @xmath132 and for @xmath133 , @xmath134 @xmath135 thus , for the purpose of analyzing the behavior of the ml estimator , we can use a modified version of the partition function , defined as @xmath136 and analyze it in the limit of @xmath117 ( the low temperature limit ) . note that here",
    ", @xmath137 has the meaning of the ( negative ) hamiltonian pertaining to a ` system configuration ' indexed by @xmath128 .    in order to characterize the behavior of @xmath138 , it is instructive to recognize that it is quite similar to the random energy model ( rem ) of disordered spin glasses : according to the rem , the energies @xmath139 , pertaining to various system configurations indexed by @xmath128 , are i.i.d",
    ".  random variables , normally assumed zero  mean and gaussian , but other distributions are possible too .",
    "this is not quite exactly our case , but as we shall see shortly , this is close enough to allow the techniques associated with the analysis of the rem to be applicable here .",
    "first , observe that under these assumptions , @xmath140s(t - mt)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\max_{|m|\\le \\delta / t}\\left[r_s(mt)+\\int_{-t/2}^{+t/2}\\mbox{d}tn(t)s(t - mt)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas for @xmath133 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 as for @xmath143 , we have , on the one hand @xmath144 and on the other hand , @xmath145 considering the limit @xmath146 for fixed @xmath147 , both the upper bound and the lower bound are dominated by the first term , which grows linearly with @xmath35 , while the second term is a random variable whose standard deviation , for large @xmath35 , scales in proportion to @xmath148 .",

    "the fixed bandwidth regime corresponds to the vertical axis ( @xmath230 ) in the phase diagram , and as can be seen , no phase transition occurs along this axis at any finite temperature .",
    "this is in agreement with our earlier discussion on the graceful behavior of the probability of anomaly at fixed bandwidth .",
    "it is instructive to compare the behavior of the ml estimator to the weiss ",
    "weinstein lower bound @xcite , @xcite because this bound is claimed to capture the threshold effect .",
    "as we have seen , the ml estimator has the following ranges of exponential behavior as a function of @xmath91 : @xmath231 on the other hand , the weiss  weinstein bound ( wwb ) for estimating a rectangular pulse in gaussian white noise is given ( in our notation ) by @xmath232_+^2 \\exp\\{-[h/\\delta]^+ct/2\\ } } { 2\\left[1-(1 - 2h / t)_+\\exp\\{-[h/\\delta]^+ct/2\\}\\right]},\\ ] ] where @xmath190_+=\\max\\{x,0\\}$ ] and @xmath190^+=\\min\\{x,1\\}$ ] .",
    "examining this bound under the asymptotic regime of @xmath146 with @xmath169 , yields the following behavior : @xmath233 in agreement with the analysis in @xcite , we readily observe that for a given @xmath91 and for high snr ( @xmath234 ) , both quantities are of the exponential order of @xmath90 , whereas for low snr ( @xmath235 ) , both are about @xmath236 .",
    "however , if we look at both quantities as functions of @xmath91 for fixed @xmath237 , there is a different behavior . not only",
    "the phase transition points differ , but also the large @xmath91 asymptotics disagree .",
    "thus , the wwb indeed captures the threshold effect of the ml estimator , but in a slightly weaker sense when it comes to the asymptotic wide - band regime .",
    "it is interesting to slightly expand the scope to a situation of mismatched estimation .",
    "suppose that instead of ml estimation based on the known waveform @xmath20 , the estimator is based on maximizing the temporal correlation with another waveform , @xmath238 , whose energy is @xmath188 and whose width is @xmath239 . in this case , the phase diagram , in the plane of @xmath114 vs.  @xmath240 , will remain essentially the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , except that there will be a degradation by a factor of @xmath241 in @xmath114 , and by a factor of @xmath242 in the rate , where @xmath243 in other words , the triple point will be @xmath244 , the vertical straight ",
    "line ferromagnetic  glassy phase boundary will be @xmath245 , rather than @xmath246 .",
    "the other phase boundaries will be as follows : the paramagnetic ",
    "ferromagnetic boundary is the parabola @xmath247 , and the paramagnetic  glassy boundary would continue to be the parabola @xmath248 , where the function @xmath249 is as defined before .",
    "the dependence on the parameter @xmath91 of the real signal is solely via its effect on the parameter @xmath241 .",
    "our derivations above are somewhat specific to the example of time delay estimation , and for the special case of a rectangular pulse .",
    "therefore , a few words about the more general picture are in order .",
    "first , consider time delay estimation of more general signals .",
    "we assumed that @xmath156 vanishes for @xmath250 , but this still leaves room for more general pulses with support @xmath104 , not necessarily the rectangular one .",
    "unfortunately , as said earlier , the exact pdf of @xmath137 , @xmath133 , is not known for a general autocorrelation function that is induced by a general choice of @xmath20 .",
    "however , for our asymptotic analysis in the regime of @xmath146 , what counts ( as we have seen ) is actually merely the tail behavior of this pdf , and this tail is known , under fairly general conditions ( see @xcite , with a reference also to @xcite ) , to behave the same way as the tail of the gaussian pdf of zero mean and variance @xmath251 . therefore , our approximate analysis in the large @xmath35 limit would continue to apply for other pulse shapes as well .",
    "second , consider the estimation of parameters other than delay ( e.g. , frequency offset or phase ) , still requiring that the time correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath252 would essentially vanish whenever @xmath253 exceeds a certain threshold ( in our earlier example , @xmath126 ) . in this case , as we have seen , the high  snr mse is inversely proportional to the squared norm , @xmath34 , of the vector @xmath254 of derivatives of @xmath255 w.r.t .",
    "again , assuming that this norm is independent of @xmath1 , it is proportional to the length of the signal locus , as discussed earlier . for a good trade - off between the high  snr mse and the anomalous mse , we would like to modulate the parameter in such a way that for a given @xmath14 , the quantity @xmath34 would grow exponentially with @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath256 , as an extension of our earlier discussion in the case of a time delay .",
    "for example , in the case of frequency  position modulation , where @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , both @xmath260 and @xmath41 should be proportional to @xmath261 . the corresponding analysis of @xmath137 and",
    "the associated partition function would be , in principle , similarly as before , except that one should consider the process @xmath262 , and the remarks of the previous paragraph continue to apply .",
    "similar comments apply to other kinds of parametrization .",
    "we now extend our earlier study to the model @xmath263 where now both @xmath264 and @xmath1 are parameters to be estimated , and where it is assumed that @xmath265 $ ] as before and @xmath266 $ ] , with @xmath267 and @xmath268 which means that the average energy ( w.r.t .",
    "the uniform distribution within the interval @xmath269 $ ] ) of the received signal is still @xmath14 . here",
    "the energy of the received signal depends on @xmath264 , as it is given by @xmath270 .",

    "accordingly , re  defining @xmath276 we get the following results : for @xmath277 , @xmath278 similarly , @xmath279 @xmath280 finally , for @xmath281 we have : @xmath282 upon maximizing over @xmath264 , we get five different phases of @xmath283 , three glassy phases and two paramagnetic ones : @xmath284 in figure [ fig1a ] , we show the phase diagram of @xmath285 . as can be seen , the paramagnetic phase is split into the two sub  phases , according to @xmath286 and @xmath225 , whereas the glassy phase is split into three parts , according to the range of @xmath91 .    finally , when we take into account the contribution of @xmath287 , where it is assumed that that true values of the parameters are @xmath288 and @xmath289 , we end up with the following expression for the re  defined @xmath290 which is given by @xmath291 where @xmath292.\\ ] ] the phase diagram of this function is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] .",
    "although the model is linear in the parameter @xmath264 , its interaction with @xmath1 exhibits , in general , more phases than the parameter @xmath1 alone , and it causes anomalies in the estimation of @xmath264 as well , but these anomalies have a different character than those associated with @xmath1 : while the anomaly makes the estimator of @xmath1 become an essentially uniformly distributed random variable within the interval @xmath293 $ ] , the anomalous estimator of @xmath264 tends to concentrate on a deterministic value as @xmath146 . to see why this is true ,",
    "observe that in the limit of large @xmath114 ( which is relevant for ml estimation ) , as long as @xmath222 , the estimation error is typically not anomalous . for @xmath294 ,",
    "the dominant value of @xmath295 is @xmath296 , whereas for @xmath297 , the dominant value of @xmath295 is @xmath298 . for low @xmath114",
    ", we also identify the region where the posterior of @xmath299 is dominated by points where @xmath300 .    referring to fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] , in the special case where @xmath301 , the eastern glassy phase and the northern paramagnetic phase disappear , and we end up with three phases only : the ordered phase ( unaltered ) , the southern paramagnetic phase , and the western glassy phase . if , in addition , @xmath302 ( i.e. , we know nothing a ",
    "priori on @xmath264 ) , then the curve @xmath303 becomes a straight line ( @xmath304 ) and in the paramagnetic region , we get @xmath305 . on the other hand ,",
    "the case @xmath306 ( i.e. , @xmath307 and there is no uncertainty in @xmath264 ) , we are back to the earlier case of a delay parameter only .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a statistical  mechanical perspective on the threshold effect in parameter estimation of non  linearly modulated wide - band signals corrupted by additive white gaussian noise .",
    "the proposed framework , which is mapped into a rem  like model of disordered spin glasses , provides a fairly comprehensive picture of the behavior of the ml estimator as a function of the bandwidth parameter @xmath91 and the temperature parameter @xmath114 .",
    "we then extended the scope to joint ml estimator of two parameters .",
    "the concepts and the techniques exercised in this paper are believed to generalize to other signal models , as well as to joint ml estimation of more than two parameters .",
    "the proposed approach may therefore serve as a yardstick for gaining insights and understanding concerning the threshold behavior in more complicated situations , including models which are expected to exhibit more than one threshold with respect to the snr ( which means more than one phase transition in the analogous physical model ) .",
    "for example , models of superimposed signals , where each component signal has its own threshold snr , or combinations of threshold effects due to non  linearity ( as studied here ) with threshold effects that stem from ambiguity .",
