    "finally the coupling of four photons through @xmath4 fluctuations is also possibile but an evaluation of such a contribution to the vacuum magnetic birefringence can not be extracted from indirect measurements.@xcite due to the quark masses , though , this last contribution can be expected to be very small .",
    "these different contributions to the four photon interaction are summarized in figure [ 4photon ] .    .",

    "euler and heisenberg in 1936@xcite derived a lagrangian density which leads to electromagnetic non linear effects even in vacuum .",

    "this lagrangian correction allows four field interactions and can be represented , to first order , by the feynman diagrams shown in figure [ 4photon ] a ) and b ) .",

    "it is evident that these will no longer be linear due to the non linear dependence of @xmath23 and @xmath24 with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath29 . by assuming a linearly polarized beam of light propagating perpendicularly to an external magnetic field @xmath30 there are two possible configurations : light polarization parallel to @xmath30 and light polarization perpendicular to @xmath30 . by substituting @xmath31 and @xmath32 in ( [ d ] ) and ( [ h ] )",
    "one finds the following relations for the relative dielectric constants and magnetic permeabilities @xmath33    from these sets of equations two important consequences are apparent : the velocity of light in the presence of an external magnetic field is no longer @xmath22 and vacuum is birefringent with @xmath34 numerically this leads to the value given in equation ( [ deltan ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to generalize the non linear electrodynamic lagrangian density correction by introducing three free parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 : @xmath38\\ ] ] where @xmath39 whereas @xmath36 and @xmath37 are dimensionless parameters depending on the model .",
    "with such a formulation the birefringence induced by an external magnetic field is @xmath40 this expression reduces to ( [ deltan ] ) if @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it is thus apparent that @xmath43 depends only on @xmath44 whereas @xmath45 depends only on @xmath46 .",
    "it is also noteworthy that if @xmath47 , as is the case in the born - infeld model , then there is no magnetically induced birefringence even though elastic scattering will be present.@xcite      as mentioned above , two other important hypothetical effects could also cause @xmath48 in the presence of an external magnetic ( or electric ) field transverse to the light propagation direction .",
    "these can be due either to neutral bosons weakly coupling to two photons called axion - like particles ( alp),@xcite@xcite or millicharged particles ( mcp).@xcite@xcite in this second case both fermions and spin-0 particles can be treated .",
    "search for axions using laboratory optical techniques was experimentally pioneered by the bfrt collaboration@xcite and subsequently continued by the pvlas effort.@xcite initially , this second experiment published the detection of a dichroism induced by the magnetic field@xcite in vacuum .",
    "such a result , although in contrast with the cast experiment,@xcite could have been due to axion - like particles . subsequently the result was excluded by the same collaboration@xcite after a series of upgrades to their apparatus and almost simultaneously the axion - like interpretation was excluded by two groups@xcite in a regeneration type measurement . however , the original publication revived interest in the optical effects which could be caused by alp s and later mcp s .",
    "the lagrangian densities describing the interaction of either pseudoscalar fields @xmath49 or scalar fields @xmath50 with two photons can be expressed as ( for convenience , written in natural heavyside - lorentz units ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the coupling constants .",
    "therefore in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field @xmath54 a photon with electric field @xmath55 parallel to @xmath54 will interact with the pseudoscalar field whereas for electric fields perpendicular to @xmath54 no such interaction will exist .",
    "for the scalar case the opposite is true : an interaction will exist if @xmath56 and will not if @xmath57 .",
    "when an interaction is present , an oscillation between the photon and the pseudoscalar / scalar field will exist .",
    "for photon energies above the mass @xmath58 of such particle candidates , a real production can follow .",
    "this will cause an oscillation of those photons whose polarization allows an interaction into such particles . on the other hand ,",
    "even if the photon energy is smaller than the particle mass , virtual production will follow and will cause a phase delay for those photons with an electric field direction allowing an interaction .    the attenuation @xmath59 and phase delay @xmath60 for light with polarization allowing an interaction can be expressed , in both the scalar and pseudoscalar cases , as:@xcite    @xmath61    where , in vacuum , @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the photon energy and @xmath64 is the magnetic field length .",
    "the above expressions are in natural heavyside - lorentz units whereby 1  t @xmath65  ev@xmath66 and 1  m @xmath67  ev@xmath68 .",
    "the phase delay @xmath60 is related to the index of refraction @xmath69 by @xmath70 therefore in the pseudoscalar case , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and in the scalar case , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the birefringence @xmath75 will be @xmath76    in the approximation for which @xmath77 ( small masses ) this expression becomes @xmath78 whereas for @xmath79 @xmath80 the different behavior of @xmath81 and @xmath82 with respect to @xmath64 in the two cases where @xmath77 and @xmath83 is interesting and leaves , in principle , a free experimental handle for distinguishing between various scenarios .",

    "therefore the magnetic field region must be as long as possible , the magnetic field as intense as possible and the wavelength small .",
    "finally the expected ellipticity must be compared to the different noise sources present and to the maximum available integration time .    experimentally @xmath113 can be made very long by using a very high finesse fabry - perot cavity .",

    "this unexplained noise is under study and we suspect variations of the intrinsic birefringence of the mirrors .",
    "we also showed that the magnet rotation did not contribute to the wideband noise indicating a good isolation between the magnet support and optical setup .      with the magnets in rotation we often observe ellipticity peaks varying from a few @xmath219 to a few @xmath220 whereas sometimes such peaks are not present .",
    "the frequencies of these peaks are at harmonics of the magnet rotation frequency .",

    "a field probe is present near the output side magnet .",
    "changing the relative orientation of the two magnets does not change the amplitude of these peaks but does change their phase indicating that the more sensitive part of the apparatus seems to be the entrance optics .",

    "the magnet rotation frequency was @xmath221  hz . in figure [ limite ] we report the histogram of the ellipticity noise in a narrow band around @xmath212 : @xmath222 hz .",
    "the integration time in this example was @xmath223 s. the probability density function for a noise amplitude with equal standard deviations @xmath224 for the in phase and quadrature components is the rayleigh function : @xmath225 . in figure [ limite ]",
