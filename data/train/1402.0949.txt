    "the well - known theorem of a.kotzig was proved for the first time in  @xcite .    *",
    "( a.kotzig , 1959 ) * let @xmath0 be a connected graph with unique perfect matching",
    ". then @xmath0 has a bridge that belongs to this matching .",
    "[ kot ]    however , the proof in  @xcite was tedious .",
    "the shortest proof of kotzig s theorem that is known now is to derive it from the following theorem of a.yeo  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 graph @xmath0 without the edge @xmath2 and by @xmath3 graph @xmath0 without the vertex @xmath4 and all edges incident to it .    *",
    "( a.yeo , 1997 ) * all edges of a graph @xmath0 are colored such that there is no alternating cycles ( i.e. each cycle has two adjacent edges of the same colors ) .",
    "then @xmath0 contains a vertex @xmath4 such that every connected component of @xmath3 is joined to @xmath4 with edges of one color .",
    "[ ye ]    this theorem have rather short and elegant proof using the method of alternating chains .",
    "let us also mention , that a particular case of yeo s theorem for coloring with two colors was proved by grossman and haggkvist in 1982  @xcite .",
    "our short proof of the theorem  [ kot ] is based on analyzing of a minimal counterexample .",
    "also we show that our method works in theorem  [ ye ]",
    ".    * acknowledgement . *",
    "the author is grateful to dmitri karpov for his comments and for discussion of proofs .",
    "suppose the statement of theorem is false .",
    "consider a counterexample @xmath0 with a minimum number of edges .",
    "let @xmath5 the set of all edges of the unique perfect matching and @xmath6 .",
    "consider two cases .",
    "consider the graph @xmath9 .",
    "clearly , it has exactly two connected components .",
    "if any of these components has a bridge that belongs to @xmath5 , then the graph @xmath0 also has such a bridge .",
    "we obtain a contradiction .",
    "hence , each connected component has a second perfect matching .",
    "clearly , then @xmath10 also has second matching .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
    "each vertex is incident to an edge of @xmath12 , otherwise @xmath0 has a bridge that belongs to @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , at least one vertex is incident to at least two edges of @xmath12 , since otherwise @xmath0 is an even cycle and hence , it has two perfect matchings .",
    "thus , @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath0 is a minimal counterexample after deleting from @xmath0 any edge of @xmath12 a bridge that belongs to @xmath5 appears in the resulting graph .",
    "hence , there are two edges @xmath14 such that both graphs @xmath15 and @xmath16 have the same bridge @xmath17 . hence , the graph @xmath18 has two bridges @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and the graph @xmath21 has three connected components .",
    "returning the bridge @xmath22 we obtain two connected components @xmath23 in @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath19 and @xmath20 are not bridges in @xmath0 , we can denote them @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 @xmath28 ( see fig .  [ zamena ] , left ) .",
    "denote by @xmath29 the edges of matchings @xmath5 lying in the component @xmath30 .",
    "let us contract @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 in edge @xmath34 ( possibly multiple edges or a loop can appear , see fig .",
    "[ zamena ] ) and obtain a graph @xmath35 .",
    "obviously , if @xmath35 has a bridge of @xmath29 , then @xmath0 has a bridge of @xmath5 .",
    "hence , there is @xmath36  a matching in @xmath35 that is different from @xmath29 . if @xmath37 , then there is a second matching @xmath38 in the graph @xmath0 , but it s impossible",
    ". then @xmath39 contains an edge @xmath34 , one can similarly define the matching @xmath40 and the graph @xmath41 and prove that there exists another matching @xmath42 in @xmath41 that contains @xmath43 .",
    "then the graph @xmath0 has a matching @xmath44 , different from @xmath5 , contradiction .",
    "assume the contrary and consider a minimal counterexample @xmath0 ( at first we minimize the number of vertices , after that the number of edges ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath0 is connected and has no cut - vertex .",
    "vertex is called _ monochrome _ if all edges incident to it are of the same color . and",
    "vertex @xmath4 of @xmath0 is called _ cut - color _ if no connected component of @xmath3 is joined to @xmath4 with edges of more than one color .",
    "consider several cases .      since @xmath0 is a minimal counterexample",
    "there is a cut - color vertex @xmath4 in @xmath46 .",
    "graph @xmath47 is connected , hence , @xmath48 . let @xmath49 be a subgraph of the graph @xmath50 induced on the vertex @xmath4 together with the connected component of @xmath51 that contains @xmath52 .",
    "now we add to @xmath49 the vertex @xmath53 and edge @xmath54 of the same color as @xmath55 and edge @xmath56 of any unique color .",
    "denote the obtained graph by @xmath57 ( see fig .",
    "[ case1 ] ) .",
    "graph @xmath57 is less than @xmath0 , otherwise the part @xmath58 has only one vertex and hence , the vertex @xmath59 in @xmath60 is monochrome .",
    "the graph @xmath57 has no monochrome vertices and no cut - color vertices ( @xmath57 has no cut - vertex ) .",
    "hence , there is the alternating cycle in @xmath57 , it must contain @xmath61 ( otherwise , there is such a cycle in @xmath10 ) .",
    "consequently , there is a alternating path form @xmath4 to @xmath62 in @xmath49 with color of last edge different from the color of edge @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , there is such a path from @xmath4 to @xmath64 .",
    "two edges incident to @xmath4 in these paths have different colors . otherwise , if their colors coincide all edges incident to @xmath4 in both parts @xmath65 and @xmath66 have the same color , and therefore , @xmath4 is monochrome , which is impossible .",
    "taking these two paths and adding to them the edge @xmath55 we obtain an alternating cycle in @xmath0 .",
    "this contradicts our assumption .",
    "since @xmath0 is a minimal counterexample , there appears a cut - color vertex @xmath4 in @xmath68 .",
    "vertex @xmath53 is incident to two edges @xmath69 and @xmath70 of distinct color .",
    "let @xmath49 be a subgraph of the graph @xmath68 induced on the vertex @xmath4 together with the connected component of @xmath71 that contains @xmath52",
    ". then we construct ( similarly @xmath7  case ) an alternating path from @xmath4 to @xmath52 with last edge with distinct color from @xmath72 in the part @xmath49 and an alternating path from @xmath4 to @xmath59 with last edge with distinct color from @xmath73 in the part @xmath58 .",
    "glue these paths together with the edges @xmath54 and @xmath70 , we obtain an alternating cycle in @xmath0 .",
    "this contradicts our assumption .",
    "let @xmath76 and @xmath77 be the other edges incident to @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively . if these two edges have different colors , then after deleting the edge @xmath80 and gluing the vertices @xmath78 and @xmath79 we obtain a smaller counterexample .",
    "if @xmath76 and @xmath77 have the same color , we delete the vertices @xmath78 and @xmath79 and add a new edge @xmath55 with the same color as @xmath81 . clearly , we obtain a smaller counterexample .",
    "let us construct a digraph on the vertices of @xmath0 using his edges .",
    "we draw an arc @xmath83 if @xmath84 is an edge of @xmath0 and the @xmath22 is a monochrome vertex of the graph @xmath85 .",
    "( maybe the arc @xmath86 is drawn too ) .",
    "let @xmath87 be the number of vertices of degree @xmath67 in @xmath0 .",

    "since there is no situation of case  @xmath11 , at least one arc starts at each vertex of degree @xmath67 . obviously , at least two arcs end at each vertex of degree 2 . since vertices of degree 2 are not adjacent , the number of arcs is at least @xmath89 .",

    ". then the sum of incoming degrees of vertices does not exceed @xmath96 .",
    "but then we have @xmath97 , hence , @xmath98 .",
