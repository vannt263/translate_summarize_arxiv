    "ew penguins contribute also in colour - allowed form to @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and may here even compete with tree - diagram - like topologies . because of the penguin dominance , @xmath5 modes represent sensitive probes for new - physics effects @xcite .",

    "so far , strategies to probe @xmath6 have focused on the following systems : @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( `` mixed '' ) @xcite@xcite , and @xmath28 , @xmath27 ( `` charged '' ) @xcite .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that also the neutral combination @xmath26 , @xmath29 is very promising @xcite .",
    "interestingly , already @xmath0-averaged @xmath5 branching ratios may lead to non - trivial constraints on @xmath6 , which rely on flavour - symmetry arguments , involving either @xmath16 or @xmath30 @xcite , and dynamical assumptions , concerning mainly the smallness of certain rescattering effects @xcite .",
    "an example is @xmath31 .",
    "there is still no theoretical consensus on the importance of such final - state interaction ( fsi ) processes , although , for instance , the `` qcd factorization '' approach  @xcite does not suggest large effects . however , there are also experimental indicators for large fsi effects , for example the decays @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and methods to include them in the strategies to probe @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "so far , these decays have not been observed and the rather strong experimental upper bounds on their @xmath0-averaged branching ratios are not in favour of dramatic fsi effects @xcite , as advocated in some of the papers given in ref .",
    "let us therefore neglect these effects for a moment .",
    "let us illustrate the derivation of the constraints on @xmath6 by considering the `` mixed '' @xmath24 , @xmath25 system @xcite .",
    "if we neglect annihilation topologies , penguins with internal up quarks and colour - suppressed ew penguins , which are expected to play a very minor role ( but may be enhanced by large fsi effects ; see subsection [ sec : bpik - gen ] ) , we may write @xmath34 \\,\\equiv\\ , -\\left[-|p|e^{i\\delta_p}+|t|e^{i\\delta_t}e^{i\\gamma } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath35 and @xmath36 describe the penguin and tree - diagram - like topologies shown in fig .",

    "it is convenient to re - write the @xmath11 decay amplitude as @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "consequently , we obtain the following expressions for the @xmath0-averaged decay amplitudes : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\left\\langle|a(b^\\pm\\to\\pi^\\pm k)|^2\\right\\rangle&=&|\\tilde p|^2\\\\ \\left\\langle|a(b_d\\to\\pi^\\mp k^\\pm)|^2\\right\\rangle&= &    the @xmath16 isospin symmetry implies @xmath43 , , which corresponds to ( [ bpik - ampl ] ) . ]",
    "we arrive at @xmath44 keeping now the hadronic quantities @xmath45 and @xmath46 as `` free '' parameters yields @xmath47 which implies @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xcite , with @xmath51 this constraint on @xmath6 is only effective if @xmath52 is found to be smaller than one . in 1997 ,",
    "when cleo reported the first result on the @xmath0-averaged @xmath24 , @xmath25 branching ratios , the result was @xmath53 .",
    "the central value @xmath54 would imply @xmath55 , thereby excluding a large range in the @xmath56@xmath57 plane . using the present cleo data @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath58 .",
    "unfortunately , the present experimental uncertainties are too large to draw any conclusions and to decide whether @xmath59 . if the parameter @xmath46 is fixed , for example through `` factorization ''",
    "@xcite , stronger constraints on @xmath6 can be obtained , which are also effective for @xmath60 @xcite .      in order to constrain @xmath6 ,",
    "the key quantities are the following ratios : @xmath61 where we have also taken into account the cleo results reported in @xcite .",
    "if we employ the @xmath16 flavour symmetry and certain dynamical assumptions , concerning mainly the smallness of fsi effects , we may derive a general parametrization for ( [ cleo - mix])([cleo - neut ] ) ( for an explicit example , see ( [ r - param ] ) ) @xcite , @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the ratio of ew penguins to `` trees '' , @xmath64 is the ratio of `` trees '' to qcd penguins , and @xmath65 is the @xmath0-conserving strong phase between `` tree '' and qcd penguin amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath63 can be fixed through theoretical arguments : in the `` mixed '' @xmath5 system , we have @xmath66 , as ew penguins contribute only in colour - suppressed form ; in the charged @xcite and neutral @xcite @xmath5 systems , @xmath67 and @xmath68 can be fixed through the @xmath30 flavour symmetry .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath64 can be determined with the help of additional experimental information : in the `` mixed '' system , @xmath46 can be fixed , for example , through arguments based on `` factorization '' @xcite , whereas @xmath69 and @xmath70 can be determined from @xmath71 by using again the @xmath30 flavour symmetry @xcite .    at this point , a comment on the fsi effects discussed in subsection  [ sec : bpik - gen ] is in order . whereas the determination of @xmath72 and @xmath46 as sketched above may be affected by fsi effects ,",
    "this is _ not _ the case for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , since here @xmath30 suffices .",
    "nevertheless , we have to assume that @xmath13 or @xmath75 do _ not _ involve a @xmath0-violating weak phase , i.e. @xmath76 this relation may be affected by rescattering processes as follows : @xmath77,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is doubly cabibbo - suppressed and is naively expected to be negligibly small . in the `` qcd factorization '' approach @xcite , there is no significant enhancement of @xmath78 through rescattering processes .",
    "however , as we have already noted , there is still no theoretical consensus on the importance of fsi effects . in the charged @xmath5 strategy to probe @xmath6 ,",
    "they can be taken into account through @xmath30 flavour - symmetry arguments and additional data on @xmath79 decays .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of the neutral strategy , fsi effects can be included in an _ exact manner _ with the help of the mixing - induced @xmath0 asymmetry @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the strong phase @xmath65 suffers from large hadronic uncertainties and is essentially unknown .",
    "however , we can get rid of @xmath65 by keeping it as a `` free '' variable , yielding minimal and maximal values for @xmath81 : @xmath82 keeping in addition @xmath64 as a free variable , we obtain another  less restrictive  minimal value for @xmath81 : @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rn ] , we show the dependence of ( [ const1 ] ) and ( [ const2 ] ) on @xmath6 for the neutral @xmath5 system .",
    "curves look very similar . ] here the crossed region below the @xmath84 curve , which is described by ( [ const2 ] ) , is excluded . on the other hand ,",
    "the shaded region is the allowed range ( [ const1 ] ) for @xmath85 , arising in the case of @xmath86 .",
    "[ fig : rn ] allows us to read off immediately the allowed region for @xmath6 for a given value of @xmath85 . using the central value of the present cleo result ( [ cleo - neut ] ) , @xmath87",

    "the corresponding situation in the @xmath89@xmath57 plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho - eta - bounds ] , where the crossed region is excluded and the circles correspond to @xmath90 .",
    "as the theoretical expression for @xmath68 is proportional to @xmath91 , the constraints in the @xmath89@xmath57 plane are actually more appropriate than the constraints on @xmath6 .",
    "if we use additional information on @xmath70 , we may put even stronger constraints on @xmath6 . for @xmath86",
    ", we obtain the allowed range @xmath92 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath84 curve is only effective for @xmath93 , which is favoured by the most recent cleo data @xcite .",
    "a similar pattern is also exhibited by the first belle results @xcite , yielding @xmath94 .",
    "for the central value @xmath95 , ( [ const2 ] ) is not effective and @xmath69 has to be fixed to constrain @xmath6 . using @xmath96 , we obtain @xmath97 .",
    "although it is too early to draw definite conclusions , it should be emphasized that the present cleo results on @xmath81 prefer the second quadrant for @xmath6 , i.e.  @xmath98 .",
    "similar conclusions were also obtained using other @xmath5 , @xmath99 strategies @xcite .",
    "interestingly , such a situation would be in conflict with the standard analysis of the unitarity triangle @xcite , yielding @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath81 allow us to determine @xmath101 as functions of @xmath6 , thereby providing also constraints on the strong phases @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the present cleo data are in favour of @xmath102 , which would be in conflict with `` factorization '' .",
    "moreover , they point towards a positive value of @xmath103 , which would be in conflict with the theoretical expectation of equal signs for @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "if future data should confirm the `` puzzling '' situation for @xmath6 and @xmath105 , which is favoured by the present @xmath5 cleo data , it may be an indication for new - physics contributions to the ew penguin sector , or a manifestation of large flavour - symmetry - breaking effects . in order to distinguish between these possibilities ,",
    "further studies are needed .",
    "as soon as @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath26 or @xmath28 are observed , @xmath106 we may even _ determine _ @xmath6 and @xmath65 .",
    "here we may also arrive at a situation , where the @xmath5 observables do not provide any solution for these quantities , which would be an immediate indication for new physics @xcite .",
    "calculations of @xmath107 modes are usually based on a perturbative picture , where strong phases are obtained from absorptive parts of loop diagrams .",
    "this approach is referred to as the `` bander  silverman  soni ( bss ) mechanism '' @xcite .",
    "recently , a conceptual improvement of this formalism was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where it is argued that there is a heavy - quark expansion for non - leptonic @xmath1-decays into two light mesons , yielding transition amplitudes of the structure given in ( [ qcd - factor ] ) . in this approach , soft non - factorizable contributions and fsi effects are suppressed by @xmath108 .",
    "however , the question arises whether the @xmath109-quark mass is large enough to suppress these terms sufficiently . moreover , there are problems due to `` chirally enhanced '' terms , which are formally suppressed by @xmath110 , but are numerically of @xmath111 .",
    "another `` perturbative '' qcd approach to deal with non - leptonic charmless @xmath1 decays was developed in ref .",
    ".    many calculations of @xmath5 , @xmath99 can be found in the literature ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the results for the @xmath0-averaged branching ratios are generally in rather good agreement with the cleo data",
    ". however , there are two exceptions : @xmath7 and @xmath112 . concerning the former decay , the calculations favour a value at the @xmath113 level , whereas cleo finds br@xmath114 .",
    "due to interference between tree - diagram - like and penguin topologies , the theoretical predictions depend on @xmath6 ; the cleo result would be in favour of @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the first babar result is br@xmath116 . concerning @xmath112 , the calculations favour a value at the @xmath117 level , which is essentially independent of @xmath6 and smaller than the cleo result br@xmath118 .",
    "interestingly , the first belle result @xmath119 is also in favour of a large @xmath0-averaged @xmath29 branching ratio . because of the large experimental uncertainties",
    ", we can not yet draw any definite conclusions .",
    "however , the experimental situation should improve significantly in the future .",
    "as we have seen in subsection  [ bpipi - alpha ] , @xmath7 is usually considered as a tool to determine @xmath120 .",
    "unfortunately , the extraction of @xmath121 from @xmath122 is affected by large penguin uncertainties , and the strategies to control them through additional data are challenging . in this section , we discuss a new approach to employ @xmath7 : combining this mode with @xmath8 ",

    "counterpart  a simultaneous determination of @xmath125 and @xmath6 becomes possible @xcite . in this method ,",
    "no model - dependent assumptions are required , and fsi effects , which led to considerable attention in the @xmath5 strategies to probe @xmath6 , do not lead to any problems .",
    "the theoretical accuracy is hence only limited by @xmath123-spin - breaking effects .",
    "this approach is promising for cdf - ii ( @xmath126 ) @xcite , and ideally suited for lhcb ( @xmath127 ) @xcite .",
    "there are also other interesting strategies to determine @xmath6 with the help of the @xmath123-spin symmetry : @xmath128 , @xmath129 @xcite or @xmath130 @xcite , as well as @xmath131 @xcite . for",

    "consequently , we have four observables , depending on six `` unknowns '' .",
    "however , since @xmath7 and @xmath8 are related to each other by interchanging all down and strange quarks , the @xmath123-spin flavour symmetry of strong interactions implies @xmath142 using this relation , the four observables ( [ asym-1])([asym-4 ] ) depend on the four quantities @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath125 and @xmath6 , which can hence be determined .      the @xmath123-spin arguments can be `` minimized '' , if we employ @xmath125 as an input , which can be determined straightforwardly from @xmath145 .",

    "<S> after an introduction to the standard - model description of @xmath0 violation and a brief look at the present status of this phenomenon in the kaon system , a classification of non - leptonic @xmath1-decays is given and the formalism of @xmath2@xmath3 mixing is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we then turn to the @xmath1-factory benchmark modes , @xmath0 violation in charged @xmath1 decays , and the @xmath4-meson system . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we focus both on @xmath5 decays , which play an important role to probe the ckm angle @xmath6 , and on the @xmath7 , @xmath8 system , which allows an interesting determination of @xmath9 and @xmath6 .    </S>",
