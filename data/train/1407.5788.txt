    "however , it was concluded that for the low temperatures characteristic of post - disruption plasmas , the collisional damping is likely to suppress the wwi and the effect of the instability on runaway beam formation is therefore small . on the other hand , the wwi may provide a diagnostic opportunity due to its sensitive dependence on the fast electron distribution function and the plasma parameters .",

    "_ _ ]    the synchrotron spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : sync_jet ] show that in @xmath178 , the particle - wave interaction has a significant effect on the synchrotron spectrum , with the peak emission increasing by roughly a factor 2.5 .",
    "the wavelength of peak emission is also shifted slightly towards shorter wavelengths .",
    "we emphasize that fig .",
    "[ fig : sync_jet ] shows the average emission per runaway , meaning that if the number of runaways can be considered fixed , the effect of the interaction with the exel wave is a significant increase of the total synchrotron emission .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , there are several other factors that have a similar effect on the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the spectrum is highly dependent on the properties of the runaway distribution , and is thus sensitive to plasma parameters such as temperature , density , impurity content and electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the effect of the exel wave interaction could only be discriminated by the characteristic sudden increase of the emission on the @xmath0 time scale .",
    "the exel wave interaction is likely to produce an even larger effect than that shown in figures [ fig : changing_jet ] and [ fig : sync_jet ] , however , since as the assumption of beam - like distribution used in our modeling breaks down , we can not simulate the later stages of the interaction .",
    "pitch - angle scattering might also increase radial transport and eventually lead to the mitigation of the runaway beam , but at an earlier stage our model predicts a burst of synchrotron radiation unaccompanied by macroscopic mhd activity .    for the distribution used in fig .",
    "[ fig : sync_jet ] , the wavelength region of strong emission is in the far - infrared and sub - millimeter regions of the spectrum , implying that detection of the effect of the exel wave instability by means of synchrotron radiation would require an infrared camera sensitive to this wavelength range .",
    "the reason for the long wavelength emission is the cut - off of the runaway distribution ( eq .  [ eq : initial ] ) at a particle energy of roughly 15  mev .",
    "a runaway electron distribution extending to higher maximum energy would allow detection by ordinary near - infrared ( or even visible light ) cameras , but realistic modeling of the evolution of the distribution function in a disruption is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "runaway electrons pose a significant threat to tokamaks . this is especially true for iter , where the runaway current might be as high as @xmath183 in disruptions , with the electron energy spectrum extending up to several tens of mev @xcite . in this paper",
    "the quasi - linear resonant interaction of the runaway population and the high - frequency obliquely propagating extraordinary - electron ( exel ) wave , which leads to rapid pitch - angle scattering of the resonant runaways , was studied .",
    "the scattering occurs when the runaway density reaches a certain critical density of about @xmath184 , depending on the plasma parameters .",
    "as soon as the exel wave is destabilized , it leads to a pitch - angle scattering of resonant electrons through quasi - linear diffusion in the velocity space on the @xmath0 time scale . in our simulations ,",
    "the spectral energy of the destabilized exel wave did not exceed @xmath185 in any of the scenarios considered , implying that direct experimental detection of the wave is likely to be difficult .    as the resonant interaction with the exel wave mainly affects the high energy runaways , which are the electrons characterizing the synchrotron radiation emitted by the whole population",
    ", the interaction causes a significant change in the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the interaction with the exel wave was shown to produce a burst of synchrotron radiation accompanied by a simultaneous shift of the spectrum towards shorter wavelengths , which might offer a possibility to detect the impact of the quasi - linear interaction in experiments .    by looking at a wide range of plasma parameters",
    ", we concluded that the characterizing quantities of the interaction ( resonant runaway momentum , wave energy , critical runaway density , etc . )",
    "have a weak dependency on plasma parameters .",
    "we can therefore extend our conclusions to an iter - like scenario .",
    "the intensity of the interaction , and the resulting change in the synchrotron spectrum , are expected to be qualitatively similar and of the same order of magnitude as for the investigated jet - like reference scenario .",
    "the only major difference in the iter case is a slightly higher stability threshold ( which could still easily be reached ) due to he stronger magnetic field .",
    "our analysis shows that the exel wave is destabilized considerably more easily , as compared to the previously studied whistler wave @xcite . a possibility for experimental confirmation of the results presented in this paper",
    "is offered through the predicted bursts in the far - infrared synchrotron emission .",
