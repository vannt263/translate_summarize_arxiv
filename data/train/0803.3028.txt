    "carbon - carbon ( c / c ) plain weave fabric composites belong to an important class of high - temperature material systems .",
    "an exceptional thermal stability together with high resistance to thermal shocks or fracture due to rapid and strong changes in temperature have made these materials almost indispensable in a variety of engineering spheres including aeronautics , space and automobile industry .",
    "applications include components in spacecraft protective shields , wing leading edges or parts of jet aircrafts turbine engines .",
    "while their appealing thermal properties such as low coefficients of thermal expansion and high thermal conductivities are known , their prediction from the properties supplied by the manufacturer for individual constituents is far from being trivial since these systems are generally highly complicated .",
    "apart from a characteristic three - dimensional ( 3d ) structure of textile composites the geometrical complexity is further enhanced by the presence of various imperfections in woven path developed during the manufacturing process .",
    "a route for incorporating at least the most severe imperfections in predictions of the mechanical properties of these systems has been outlined in  @xcite in the context of statistically equivalent periodic unit cell .",
    "although properly accounting for three - dimensional effects the resulting representative volume element still suffers from the absence of the porous phase , which in real systems , fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , may exceed 30@xmath0 of the overall volume . as suggested in  @xcite ,",
    "neglecting the material porosity may severely overestimate the resulting thermal properties of textile composites . in this regard ,",
    "the procedure introduced in the current paper extends the previous studies , as they either neglect the porous phase  @xcite or analyze the porosity effects on the level of fibers and tows only  @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     to judge the quality of any computational approach purely from numerical experiments seems , however , rather shallow .",
    "to enhanced credit of a numerical analysis it is therefore desirable to compare the numerical results with those obtained experimentally . for this type of composite the results from experimental investigation of the thermophysical properties are available in  @xcite . for details on the pulse transient method used in this work together with computational models required to relate temperature to the generated heat pulse we refer the reader to the above paper .",
    "some basic information can also be found in  @xcite .",
    "the experimentally determined macroscopic conductivities appear in table  [ t : comp ] .",
    "taking into account the possible errors in the determination of phase material parameters ( carbon fibers and carbon matrix ) on the one hand and errors associated with the laboratory measurements on the other hand adds further confidence in the presented three - level uncoupled multiscale homogenization approach . in this context , the simplified two - dimensional approach ( with the exception to the lowest scale ) adopted for the solution of a generally three - dimensional problem , a natural component of laboratory measurements , should also be added to a list of sources of possible errors .",
    "it is worth noting even under these simplifications , the errors associated with the analysis compare well with the results of fully 3d analyses reported in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is expected that a reliable three - dimensional geometrical model constructed on the mesoscopic level will further improve the predictive capabilities of the multiscale solution strategy .",
    "this is the topic of our current research .",
    "three levels of hierarchy are introduced in this contribution to derive the effective thermal conductivities of a plain weave textile laminate .",
    "different resolution of microstructural details are considered on individual scales for the construction of an adequate representative unit cell .",
    "such a unit cell arises as a result of elaborate evaluation of images of a real composite sample .",
    "the geometrical complexity of these types of composites are mainly responsible for a slow progress in the formulation of a generally three - dimensional unit cell .",
    "possibility to enlighten this subject is given in  @xcite promoting the construction of such an rve by matching statistical characteristics of both the real composite and rve , at this step , however , in the absence of a porous phase .",
    "owing to a significant contribution of this phase to the overall volume of the composite ruled the choice of a simplified two - dimensional analysis for the present study .",
    "clearly , the theoretical formulation , here developed on the basis of the first - order homogenization , is quite general and space invariant .",
    "both transient and steady state conditions were examined in this study .",
    "when considering solely the temperature boundary conditions of type  @xmath1 allows the solution to be accepted even if neglecting the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "proper averaging relations then still provide the correct means for the scale transition .",
    "this has been exploited when running the transient heat conduction problem .",
    "the periodic constraints , on the other hand , were imposed for the estimates of effective thermal conductivities under the steady state conditions . in this case , too fine discretization needed for the straightforward introduction of periodic boundary conditions was of minor concern .",
    "both approaches have shown , however , their potential in the derivation of the desired effective ( homogenized ) thermal conductivities of highly complex plain weave textile composites through the application of fully uncoupled multiscale homogenization scheme .",
