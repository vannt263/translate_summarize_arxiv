    "the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) has established coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) as an integral part of solar eruptions . today we know that there exist slow and fast cmes associated with eruptive quiet - sun filaments and solar flares , respectively , with a wide velocity distribution ranging between a few tens of @xmath1 to @xmath2 ( st .",
    "cyr et al . 2000 ; yashiro et al .",
    "2004 ; yurchyshyn et al .",
    "solar flares are an exclusive characteristic of solar active regions ( ars ) , so fast cmes , typically with velocities @xmath3 , are active - region cmes ( sheeley et al . 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , the soft x - ray rise phase of the eruptive flares almost coincides with the main acceleration phase of the resulting cmes ( zhang et al .",
    "2001 ; zhang and dere 2006 ) .",
    "observations and models have been utilized to relate specific ar characteristics with cme speeds . following a `` big ar syndrome ''",
    ", extraordinary ars can trigger superfast cmes ( gopalswamy et al .",
    "2005 ) , but a more quantitative connection is lacking .",
    "only recently , qiu and yurchyshyn ( 2005 ) reported a strong correlation between cme speeds and the reconnected magnetic flux in two - ribbon flares , su et al .",
    "( 2007 ) combined magnetic flux and shear to improve correlations with flare magnitudes and cme speeds , and trk and kliem ( 2007 ) concluded that increased magnetic complexity , reflected on steep magnetic gradients in the source ars corona , tends to produce faster cmes .",
    "the above studies suggest that complex ( multipolar and/or with pronounced magnetic polarity inversion lines [ pils ] ) ars tend to produce faster cmes . here",
    ", we investigate this effect further , reporting on work done in the framework of the living with a star coordinated data analysis workshops ( lws / cdaw ) .",
    "we identified 23 source ars with eruptions _ unambiguously _ traced from the solar surface to 1 au .",
    "for these ars , we correlate the _ peak _ photospheric complexity prior to an eruption with various eruption parameters , including flare magnitudes , plane - of - sky cme velocities , and ( assumed constant ) cme acceleration magnitudes .",
    "our analysis involves full - halo cmes with source ars located close to disk center .",
    "therefore , it should be kept in mind that significant discrepancies may exist between the measured ( plane - of - sky ) and the true ( unprojected ) cme velocities ( schwenn et al .",
    "2005 ) , that may have an impact on correlations . for this and other reasons , as discussed below",
    ", we emphasize the statistical aspect of the reported correlations , trying to avoid strong quantitative conclusions .",
    "georgoulis and rust ( 2007 ) defined the _ effective connected magnetic field strength _ , @xmath4 , that characterizes a given ar at a given time .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath4 , the more intense the pil(s ) present in the ar .",
    "the intensity of a pil increases when massive amounts of bipolar magnetic flux are tightly concentrated around it . to calculate @xmath4 for the @xmath5 positive - polarity and @xmath6 negative - polarity flux concentrations that comprise an ar , we calculate two @xmath7 connectivity matrices : @xmath8 , containing the magnetic fluxes that connect a positive - polarity concentration @xmath9 ( @xmath10 $ ] ) to a negative - polarity concentration @xmath11 ( @xmath12 $ ] ) , and @xmath13 , containing the respective separation lengths of the connections .",
    "then , @xmath4 is the sum of all finite elements @xmath14 .",
    "georgoulis and rust ( 2007 ) calculated @xmath4 for @xmath15 soho / mdi magnetograms corresponding to 298 ars . to avoid severe projection effects ,",
    "each ar was required to be located within @xmath16 ew from solar disk center .",
    "each ar needed 6 - 7 days to traverse this @xmath17-zone , and this determined the typical observing period . to further account for projection effects , we ( i ) estimated the normal ar magnetic field by dividing the line - of - sight field by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the angular distance of each location from disk center , ( ii ) constructed the local , heliographic , plane , and ( iii ) interpolated the normal field on the heliographic plane .",
    "we found that @xmath4 efficiently distinguishes eruptive from non - eruptive ars   and that a well - defined probability for major ( x- and m - class , although _ not _ their exact magnitudes ) flares depends solely on @xmath4 .",
    "an example of how an increase in @xmath4 translates to stronger pils that , in turn , give rise to repeated flaring activity , is shown in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2007 ) , on the other hand , identified the solar sources of 88 geoeffective ( @xmath20 ) solar eruptions .",
    "each of these eruptions was traced from solar source to geomagnetic effect .",
    "an ar source could be identified for 54 of the above 88 events , with 23 different source ars present .    combining the above two works , we calculated the peak pre - eruption ( 12 hr , at most , before each flare s onset ) @xmath4-values for these 23 source ars .",
    "the ar and eruption data are summarized in table [ tb1 ] .",
    "we seek a possible link between the peak ar photospheric complexity , quantified by the peak @xmath4 , and the flare magnitude or cme kinematics .",
    "the flare magnitudes are related to the peak preflare @xmath4-values in figure [ f3]a . to calculate the logarithmic flare magnitude we arbitrarily assign a magnitude of 1 to a c1.0 flare .",
    "this implies a magnitude of 10 , 100 , and 1000 , for a m1.0 , x1.0 , and x10 , flares , respectively ( dashed lines ) .",
    "notice the significant correlation coefficients ( cc ) between the flare magnitude and @xmath4 , despite the scatter .",
    "the correlation clearly implies an increasing flare magnitude for an increasing preflare @xmath4 .",
    "however , predictions of the flare magnitude using the shown scaling are not recommended .",
    "this is because an ar may not yield its strongest flare within the typical 6 - 7 day observing period despite showing a high ( close to peak ) @xmath4-value .",
    "the scatter in figure [ f3]a might also highlight the probabilistic ( or even stochastic ) nature of flare triggering , with the flare magnitude depending in part on the local magnetic conditions and their synergy . the goodness of fit in figure [ f3]a has a confidence level of @xmath21% . _ in brief , increasing @xmath4 in an ar statistically implies stronger flares triggered in the ar_.    in figure [ f3]b we correlate the plane - of - sky cme velocities @xmath22 with the peak preflare @xmath4-values .",
    "although the small dynamical range of @xmath22 gives rise to lower and more fragile correlation coefficients , the scatter around the least - squares best fit appears smaller in this case .",
    "this allows the introduction of a scaling relation between @xmath22 and peak preflare @xmath4 that reads @xmath23 equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is , again , not recommended for accurate predictions of @xmath22 but it suggests that _ more complex ars _ , with larger and more intense pils , statistically give rise to _ faster _ cmes . for the smallest considered @xmath4-value ( @xmath24 ) we anticipate @xmath25 , in good agreement with the slower end of ar cmes ( @xmath26 ) . for our largest @xmath4 ( @xmath27 ) , we expect @xmath28 , that is relatively close to ( but somewhat smaller than ) the largest measured cme velocities ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the difference between the two extreme velocities is @xmath30% , with a typical @xmath31%-uncertainty for the measured plane - of - sky cme speed ( j. zhang , private communication ) .",
    "the goodness of fit in figure [ f3]b has a confidence level of @xmath32% . _",
    "therefore , it is clear that increasing @xmath4 in an ar statistically implies faster cmes triggered in the ar .",
    "_    in figure [ f3]c we correlate the cme acceleration magnitude @xmath33 with the peak preflare @xmath4 .",
    "we have estimated a constant @xmath33 by the ratio @xmath34 , i.e. , by following the `` flare - proxy '' approach ( zhang and dere 2006 ) implying that @xmath35 also reflects the main cme acceleration phase .",
    "although the trend in figure [ f3]c is to attain stronger @xmath33 with increasing @xmath4 , the correlation is not as appreciable as in figures [ f3]a , [ f3]b .",
    "the goodness of the fit is also lower ( confidence level @xmath36% ) . besides numerical effects ( e.g. , discrepancies between plane - of - sky and true cme velocity )",
    ", the weaker correlation between @xmath33 and @xmath4 may be due to ( i ) the assumption of a constant cme acceleration magnitude , and/or ( ii ) the very weak anti - correlation between @xmath35 and @xmath4 ( cc @xmath37 - not shown ) .",
    "the loose association between @xmath35 and @xmath4 means that the intensity of pils in ars correlates only weakly with the impulsiveness of the flares triggered in these ars .",
    "_ nevertheless , figure [ f3]c suggests that increasing @xmath4 in an ar statistically implies more impulsively accelerated cmes triggered in the ar .",
    "_    we did not find significant correlations ( maximum cc @xmath38 and maximum confidence levels @xmath39% ) when correlating @xmath4 with ( i ) the icme transit time @xmath40 and ( ii ) the peak absolute @xmath0 index of the resulting geomagnetic storms .",
    "neither result is surprising : schwenn et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and manoharan ( 2006 ) report some correlation between @xmath40 and @xmath22 but with substantial scatter .",
    "other heliospheric effects may also impact the velocity profile , and hence the arrival time , of icmes ( chen 1996 ; cargill 2004 ; tappin 2006 ) . regarding @xmath0 , many factors , besides the source ar s complexity , affect the icme geoeffectiveness .",
    "these factors include , but are not limited to , the cme s source location in the solar disk , the orientation of the possible post - eruption flux rope , in - situ heliospheric distortions , turbulence , interactions with other heliospheric transients , and the icme velocity profile .",
    "in a previous work ( georgoulis and rust 2007 ) we quantified the photospheric magnetic complexity in solar ars , where complexity reflects the strength of pils in these ars . in this work",
    "we combined our sample of ars with the sample of ar sources that triggered major geomagnetic eruptions ( zhang et al .",
    "we identified 23 source ars for which we have preflare ar magnetograms , and we correlated the peak pre - eruption ar complexity with various eruption parameters .",
    "significant correlations were uncovered when plotting the peak value of the ar complexity index , @xmath4 , vs. ( from stronger to weaker correlation ) ( i ) the flare magnitude , ( ii ) the cme velocity , and ( iii ) an assumed constant cme acceleration magnitude .",
    "though not ideal for predictive purposes , these correlations clearly imply that more complex ars , with intense pils , can produce statistically stronger flares and faster , more impulsively accelerated , cmes .",
    "our finding goes a step further than the usual `` big ar syndrome '' : big ( flux - massive ) ars are not necessarily ars with intense pils , and hence with large @xmath4-values , although the opposite is almost always true .    at this point , we can only speculate on a possible interpretation of our results , making it clear that only further work can validate or rule out our scenario .",
    "given that the main cme acceleration phase nearly coincides with the flare impulsive phase , the initial ascending structure evolving into a cme ( hereafter cme precursor ) should start expanding _ before _ the flare .",
    "as it expands , the cme precursor interacts with the surrounding pil - supported magnetic structure causing magnetic reconnection .",
    "reconnection in stronger magnetic fields organized along more intense pils statistically leads to stronger flares ( figure [ f3]a ) .",
    "stronger flares imply larger amounts of released magnetic energy that , in turn , probably destabilize larger parts of the pil - sustained structure and/or accelerate the unstable magnetic fields to higher speeds , thus giving rise to statistically faster ( figure [ f3]b ) and more impulsive ( figure [ f3]c ) cmes .",
    "again , the above indicate only statistical trends - the local field conditions at the flare location along the pil as well as the overlaying solar magnetic fields ( steep magnetic gradients [ trk and kliem 2007 ] , coronal null points [ antiochos et al . 1999 ] , etc . )",
    "affect both flare magnitudes and cme velocity profiles .",
    "sometimes , fast cmes are associated with relatively weak flares or vice - versa ( vrnak et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the above idea might also help understand the difference between ( i ) confined and eruptive flares and ( ii ) fast active - region cmes and slow quiet - sun cmes . in case",
    "the pil - supported structure , despite the reconnection , survives the perturbation applied by the cme precursor , a confined flare occurs .",
    "if there is no intense pil , the cme precursor might easily destabilize the surrounding magnetic structure ( especially in the presence of `` open '' overlaying fields , such as a streamer in the high corona ) but , since only minor reconnection is expected , no major flare and a rather slow cme will occur",
    ". this might be the case for some quiet - sun cmes .",
    "while our statistical results appear solid , only further work can validate the above physical scenario",
    ". it would be essential to ( i ) uncover the physical mechanism(s ) responsible for the possible cme precursor ( e.g. , small - scale helical kink instability , magnetic flux cancellation on the pil , etc . ) , and ( ii ) find the relation between the plane - of - sky velocity @xmath22 and the true cme velocity and determine whether this improves the correlation with @xmath4 or the source ar s complexity in general .",
    "the solar terrestrial relations observatory ( stereo ) can be instrumental in revealing the true cme velocities to be used for definitive conclusions in our quest to understand the erupting sun .",

    "i also thank a. vourlidas for enlightening discussions in the physics of cmes , the organizers of the lws / cdaw meetings for their sustained and successful efforts , and the two anonymous referees , whose thoughtful comments contributed significantly to this paper .",
