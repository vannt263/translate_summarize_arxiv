    "are also known to differ from ordinary ellipticals in their more extended surface brightness profiles and in their deviations from scaling relations obeyed by other ellipticals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "galaxies build up their stellar mass through mergers with other galaxies , and through in - situ star formation , fed by cold flows and/or cooling flows that deliver gas to the potential well centers of their host haloes . in the absence of any environmental effects",
    ", bggs should simply be statistical extremes : their extreme luminosities / stellar masses are merely a consequence of them being _ defined _ as the brightest / most massive galaxies in their group .",
    "put differently , from a _ physical _ point of view , there is nothing special about a bgg .",
    "however , it is well known that environment does play an important role . of particular importance is the distinction between central galaxies , defined as the galaxy in a host halo with the minimal specific potential energy , and satellite galaxies , which are galaxies that orbit around a central galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typically central galaxies are expected to grow in mass by cannibalizing their satellites @xcite and by being the repositories of cooling flows [ although agn feedback may prevent such gas from being turned into stars ; e.g. @xcite ] , whereas satellite galaxies are subjected to a number of processes that quench star formation ( i.e. , ram - pressure stripping , strangulation ) and strip mass ( i.e. tidal stripping ) .",
    "if these ` environmental ' effects have a significant impact on the luminosities and/or stellar masses of the galaxies , one might expect bggs , which typically are central galaxies ( though not always , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to evolve into a distinct population .",
    "there are still controversies concerning the statistical nature of bggs .",
    "early analysis @xcite found that the luminosity distribution of bggs is consistent with an statistical extreme value population .",
    "more recent analyses , using statistical tests such as the asymptotic form of the bgg luminosity function @xcite and the luminosity gap between the first and second ranked group members @xcite , reached the opposite conclusion : bggs are distinct compared to the extreme value statistics ( however , see @xcite .",
    "there have also been investigations that attempt to reconcile the two results by considering two populations for the bggs @xcite .",
    "most of these analysis focused on rich clusters , where the number of member galaxies is large but the total number of systems is limited .",
    "more recently , @xcite applied an order statistics to a large sample of luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ? * ) data release 7 ( dr7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and concluded that lrgs can be viewed as an extreme value sample when they are binned in redshift rather than in terms of the richness of their host group . using lrgs selected from the sdss and the sdss - iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey @xcite , @xcite found that the large luminosity gap between the lrg and the most luminous satellite can be reproduced by sparsely sampling a schechter function obtained for galaxies in random fields , suggesting that lrgs obey extreme value statistics(see also * ? ? ?",

    "in the present paper , we study the statistical properties of bggs using an order statistics analysis similar to that carried out by @xcite .",
    "the order statistics ( hereafter os ) studies the expected distribution of the @xmath3-th order ( largest value ) of a given quantity ( e.g. luminosity ) among a sample ( group ) with @xmath4 members ( galaxies ) which are randomly drawn from an underlying probability density distribution .",
    "the extreme value statistic ( hereafter evs ) thus corresponds to @xmath5 of the os .",
    "our analysis is based on galaxies in individual groups selected from a large spectroscopic survey , the sdss dr7 .",
    "this allows us to divide our group sample into different richness bins , and to study the luminosity distribution of the member galaxies separately for each of the richness bins ( section [ sec_data ] ) .",
    "we simulate statistical samples by building mock groups using the observed group member distribution function , and compare the properties of the member galaxies in a given rank between real and simulated samples to examine whether the luminosity distributions of bggs and other highly - ranked member galaxies are consistent with the os populations ( section [ sec_os ] ) .",
    "simple models are then presented to understand how bggs may over - grow their masses relative to other members ( section [ sec_model ] ) .",
    "the specialties of bggs are further discussed in section [ sec_tr ] using the tremaine - richestone test@xcite .",

    ", we use sample iii as our group catalog . as pointed out in @xcite , the added redshifts in sample iii may cause the number of members of some of the galaxy groups to be overestimated .",

    "as shown above , the luminosity distribution of the bggs are not consistent with the os population expected from the clf , while the sggs are consistent with being the extremes of the satellite members expected from the clf of satellite galaxies .",
    "these results suggest that bggs are distinct from other member galaxies . in the current hierarchical structure formation model ,",
    "bggs are typically associated with the host haloes and located at the centers of their hosts , while other member galaxies are typically associated with dark matter subhaloes .",
    "thus , being the centrals , bggs may have the privilege to grow more during their evolution through galaxy cannibalism or through star formation fueled by cooling flows . here , we test such a scenario using a toy model .",
    "we assume that the assembly history of a halo is only correlated with its halo mass , so that for groups with a given richness ( halo mass ) , their members follow the same initial luminosity distribution function .",

    "thus , to test the model , we apply the _ reversed _ brightening process ( @xmath0 ) to the observed bggs ( @xmath40 ) and check whether or not the ` dimmed ' bggs ( @xmath74 ) is consistent with the os prediction of the luminosity distribution of galaxies in the sample where bggs are replaced by their ` dimmed ' counterparts ( referred to as the ` bgg - dimmed ' sample ) .",
    "moreover , to get further constraints on @xmath0 , we may also check whether the magnitude of sggs ( @xmath72 ) and galaxies in other rank orders are consistent with the os predictions based on the underlying distributions of the ` bgg - dimmed ' sample .    in practice , for each @xmath23 bin we reduce the luminosity of each bgg by an amount of @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is parameterized by some simple model parameters ( to be specified later ) . in order to ensure that the bgg retains its brightest status after dimming , @xmath0 is constrained to be smaller than the observed magnitude gap , @xmath1 , for any given group ( to be discussed later ) .",
    "after this dimming , we make statistical tests on whether all the ordered members become being consistent with os predictions .",
    "to do that , we apply a shuffling algorithm on the group members of this ` bgg - dimmed sample ' within each @xmath23 bin .",
