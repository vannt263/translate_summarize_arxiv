    "complex systems of physics , chemistry , and biology are composed of a huge number of microscopic subsystems interacting on a fast time scale .",
    "self organized behaviour may arise on a macroscopic length and time scale which can be described by suitably defined order parameters .",
    "the microscopic degree s of freedom , however , show up in terms of fast temporal variations which effectively can be treated as random fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the adequate description of such systems viewed from a macroscopic perspective are langevin equations , which contain a deterministic part described by the drift vector and a fluctuating part whose impact on the dynamics is quantified by a diffusion matrix @xcite .",
    "recently , a procedure has been proposed that allows for a direct estimation of these quantities and , hence , of the stochastic dynamics from measured data @xcite .",
    "this procedure has provided a deeper insight to a broad class of systems , especially in the field of _ life sciences _ @xcite . moreover , also turbulence research has greatly benefited from this procedure @xcite .    however , the procedure is based on the estimation of conditional moments in the limit of high sampling frequencies , @xmath0^k\\big|x(t)=x\\right\\rangle\\quad , \\ ] ] for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively",
    ". @xmath3 is the drift vector , while @xmath4 exhibits the diffusion matrix of the underlying process at position @xmath5 .",
    "the limiting procedure ( [ eqn : kramers - moy ] ) can be problematic in case of a finite time resolution of measured data .",
    "moreover , any presence of measurement or discretization noise seriously interferes with the convergence of the limiting procedure .",
    "recently , we proposed an iterative method that circumvents this limiting procedure @xcite .",
    "it is based on the minimization of the kullback - leibler distance @xcite between the two time joint probability distribution functions ( pdf ) obtained from the data and the simulated process for a certain set of parameters , respectively .",
    "the starting configuration of this iterative procedure as well as a suitable parametrization of drift and diffusion functions can be obtained by the direct estimates based on the smallest reliable time increment @xmath6 , provided by ( [ eqn : kramers - moy ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the analysis of discrete stochastic processes by means of _ maximum likelihood_-methods has made great progress in recent years : since it has become evident , that the maximisation of the likelihood function is a powerful tool for the analysis of markovian time series @xcite , several methods have been proposed to optimise the calculation of the required conditional transition pdfs @xcite . for a recent study on the preferences of current methods we refer to @xcite .",
    "the intention of the present note is to derive a maximum likelihood estimator for parameters of the parametrized drift vector and diffusion matrix , that purely is based on the conditional and joint transition pdfs of the dataset under consideration . by this means",
    ", the kullback - leibler estimator reappears in case of an ensemble of individual measurements  but now physically well motivated .",
    "we want to point out , that the evaluation of a specific parametrisation by means of the minimization of the kullback - leibler estimator yields great advantages , since this function is bounded from below by the value @xmath7 .",
    "hence , the goodness of a single parametrisation can be assessed .",
    "moreover , with respect to our previous treatment @xcite , a simplified maximum likelihood estimator is introduced for the analysis of nonlinear time series exhibiting markovian properties .",
    "this estimator leads to a reasonable reduction of the required computational effort compared to a direct application of the former method and is proposed for future application in nonlinear time series analysis .",
    "accurate results can be obtained even in the case of few or sparsely sampled measurement data .",
    "however , the relevance of the results obtained in the case of data sets involving few data points carefully has to be reconsidered in a self consistent manner .",
    "we consider time series @xmath8 , @xmath9 of @xmath10 recordings of a multivariate stochastic variable .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the time lag between consecutive observations is @xmath6 . henceforth , the abbreviation @xmath11 will be used .    in this section ,",
    "the estimation of drift and diffusion functions from an ensemble of @xmath12 independent time series is considered .",
    "such data sets generally are obtained from measurements on an ensemble of @xmath12 independent systems , that are performed simultaneously . in this vein",
    ", the time evolution of the stochastic properties can be analysed . for the present case , we restrict ourselves without loss of generality to the analysis of the first two consecutive measurements @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 $ ]",
    ".    by means of the direct estimation described in @xcite , drift and diffusion functions can be estimated from data from the kramers - moyal expansion coefficients ( [ eqn : kramers - moy ] ) . on the basis of this estimate ,",
    "models for the drift and diffusion function , respectively , can be constructed , depending on a set of parameters , @xmath16 .",
    "this procedure is described in greater detail in @xcite .",
    "the likelihood of the current realization for one specific set of parameters , @xmath16 , can be expressed by means of the joint pdf , @xmath17 since the individual @xmath12 processes are assumed to be statistically independent of one another , this joint pdf degenerates into a product of two point joint pdfs , @xmath18 this expression can be simplified considerably .",
    "first , we consider the logarithm of ( [ eqn : en : kette ] ) , usually called log - likelihood function @xcite , @xmath19\\quad.\\ ] ] with help of @xmath20 expression ( [ eqn : en : logpdf ] ) finally can be evaluated by means of an integral , @xmath21\\\\ & & = n\\int d\\boldsymbol{x}\\int d\\boldsymbol{x'}\\ \\hat{p}(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{x'}|\\tau ) \\log\\left[p(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{x'}|\\boldsymbol{a})\\right]\\quad . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function , the maximization of the likelihood function is equivalent to the maximization of its logarithm .",

    "henceforth , individual time series @xmath24 are considered .",
    "we assume that the time lag between consecutive observations is @xmath6 and that the process is stationary in a sense , that the statistical properties are conserved during the measurement period .    let us further assume , that the data set under consideration exhibits markovian properties .",
    "this can be verified by means of the chapman - kolmogorov equation @xcite , @xmath25 that can be evaluated numerically .",
    "although this condition is not sufficient , it seems to be a very robust criterion .",
    "if markovian properties are not fulfilled , an increase of the number of observables by means of a delay embedding of the data may help to fulfil this constraint , if the amount of data is sufficiently high for such an procedure @xcite .",
    "if the process under consideration is ergodic , time averages can be evaluated by means of ensemble averages .",
    "then , also in this case a reasonable parametrization and initial condition for the vector @xmath16 can be obtained by the direct evaluation of ( [ eqn : kramers - moy ] ) , as described in the previous section .",

    "the first measurement in some cases may not obey the stationary distribution due to transient processes of the measurement . on the other hand ,",
    "the evaluation of the expression may be time - consuming since the stationary distribution of the process is required . in conclusion",
