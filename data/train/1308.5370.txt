    "the development of critical technologies is required to accomplish the science goals of future nasa x - ray observatories .",
    "one such technology is off - plane reflection gratings to produce high throughput and high spectral resolving power at energies below 1.5 kev .",
    "grating spectrometers are currently used onboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and _ xmm - newton _ as the main workhorses for x - ray spectroscopy with a resolution limit of 1000 ( @xmath0 ) and low effective area ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) over the same band .",
    "future goals of @xmath3 spectral resolving power and effective areas of @xmath4 @xmath2 necessitate a new generation of high quality spectrometers capable of achieving these performance requirements @xcite .",
    "off - plane reflection gratings are an attractive option for x - ray spectrometers .",
    "they offer compact packing geometries , excellent grating efficiency , and the potential for very high resolving powers .",
    "an array of off - plane gratings can be coupled with a set of nested wolter - i optics ( a primary parabolic mirror , followed by a secondary hyperbolic ) to disperse a spectrum onto an imaging detector placed at the focal plane , typically a ccd camera @xcite .",
    "the spectrum forms an arc of diffracted light in the shape of a cone , giving the common name for this type of diffraction  conical diffraction .    to obtain future requirements of spectral resolving power and throughput , off - plane",
    "gratings require customized groove profiles .",
    "[ opgeom ] depicts the grating geometry and outlines the necessary advancements .",
    "the image on the left is the canonical off - plane geometry with light intersecting a ruled grating nearly parallel to the groove direction .",
    "this creates an arc of diffraction at the focal plane with dispersion dictated by the displayed grating equation .",
    "the image on the right is similar , but has the optical axis pointing out of the page .",
    "the grating grooves are shown projected from the position of the gratings to a focal plane located several ( typically @xmath5 ) meters away .",
    "high x - ray throughput requires high reflectivity and hence grazing incidence . to increase the total collecting area ,",
    "many gratings are stacked into an array .",
    "tight packing geometries are allowed because the cone angle of the diffracted light is roughly equal to the graze angle of the incoming light .",
    "the effective area can be increased further by blazing the groove facets to a triangular profile that preferentially disperses light to one side of zero order .",
    "this requires a smaller readout detector ( or less detectors in an array ) and thus increases the signal - to - noise in these orders .",
    "the angle of the blaze on the grooves ( @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ opgeom ] ) is chosen to optimize diffraction efficiency toward the middle of the first order bandpass .",
    "this , in turn , translates to optimized efficiencies at higher orders for shorter wavelengths .",
    "the grating array is then rotated slightly about the grating normal resulting in an @xmath7 for zero order at the focal plane that equals the @xmath8 of the optimized wavelength .",
    "when @xmath9 the array is in the littrow configuration and is optimized for diffraction efficiency @xcite . the similarity to the littrow configuration in the in - plane diffraction sense",
    "can be seen by examining fig .",
    "[ opgeom ] and setting @xmath10 .",
    "the projection of the grooves in fig .",
    "[ opgeom ] illustrates the radial distribution of grooves necessary to achieve high spectral resolving power @xcite .",
    "this convergence matches that of the telescope beam , thus maintaining a constant @xmath7 over the grating .",
    "this leads to a constant @xmath8 per wavelength at the focal plane and eliminates grating induced aberration due to the groove profile .",
    "in other words , the converging rays from the wolter i mirrors strike the grating at nearly the same angle with respect to the grooves at all points on the grating surface .",
    "high groove density is another grating characteristic necessary for high spectral resolving power .",
    "the baseline for future x - ray missions includes telescope optics with a @xmath11 arcsecond half power diameter ( hpd ) .",
    "the telescope beam can be sub - apertured @xcite by the grating array to create a bowtie shaped line spread function ( lsf ) with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath12 arcsecond in the dispersion direction .",
    "the dispersion of a grating measures the physical extent over which the spectrum is diffracted .",
    "it is proportional to both the groove density and the distance between the grating array and the focal plane , the latter typically being called the throw .",
    "therefore , higher groove densities and/or longer throws increase dispersion , and therefore , spectral resolving power .",
    "a throw of several meters ( @xmath13 ) and a @xmath14 arcsecond telescope hpd that can be sub - apertured down to @xmath12 arcsecond translates to groove density requirements of @xmath15 grooves / mm .",
    "[ opgeom ] also depicts the need for precision alignment within the off - plane grating array .",
    "the grooves on each grating converge to a point at the center of the circle defined by the intersection of the cone of diffraction with the focal plane .",
    "this focal circle is also coincident with the telescope focus and the zero order focus .",
    "the gratings within an array are aligned such that all groove hubs are coincident .",
    "also , all grating surfaces must project to the diameter of the focal circle . with these alignments",
    "achieved , the spectra from each grating overlap at the focal plane .",
    "the off - plane mount provides a method for achieving the performance requirements of future soft x - ray spectroscopy missions .",
    "however , developments in grating fabrication and alignment are necessary to ready this technology for flight .",
    "first , off - plane gratings require custom profiles and higher groove densities in comparison to in - plane gratings .",
    "second , the alignment tolerances are tighter in comparison to transmission grating spectrometers . issues pertaining to the former are being addressed in a parallel study @xcite . in this paper , we take the first step to address the latter by quantifying the off - plane alignment tolerances for a general spectrometer architecture .",
    "first , we outline the mathematical formalism for analyzing the diffraction by an off - plane reflection grating .",
    "next , we define nominal alignment parameters using this formalism for a flight - like spectrometer .",
    "analytical alignment tolerances are obtained for all six degrees of freedom .",
    "we verify these analytical calculations numerically using computer raytracing .",
    "the alignment tolerances are presented and examined for scalability with spectrometer focal length and spectral resolution requirement .",
    "finally , we investigate the dependence of diffraction efficiency on misalignments .",
    "harvey & vernold ( 1998 ) describe a convenient formalism for predicting the diffraction of light incident upon a parallel groove reflection grating for arbitrary grating orientation with respect to the incident beam .",

    "as mentioned in  [ sec : math ] , the formalism used in this paper does not account for changes in diffraction efficiency .",
    "if the diffraction efficiency per grating were to change appreciably due to misalignments , calculating the effective area of the grating spectrometer would have to take this into account .",
    "in fact , this would also greatly complicate the energy response function of the spectrometer : the precise alignment of each mirror pair and grating would need to be known to compute the on - axis energy response function , and an off - axis source could potentially change the response function in a significant manner . fortunately , we have performed efficiency simulations that show this is not a concern for our expected misalignments .",
    "we use the commercial software pcgrate - s(x ) v.6.1",
    "  ( i.i.g .  inc . ) to compute our efficiencies , as the dependence of diffraction efficiency on beam geometry and wavelength is a complicated computational problem ( see neviere & popov 1998 for a review ) .",
    "the software works by solving a system of integral equations over the periodic groove boundary .",
    "we assume a grating with an @xmath139 blaze angle and a 160 nm period .",
    "the groove profile is right triangular , and the groove material is gold .",
    "the nominal @xmath46 and @xmath47 are as in  [ sec : assumptions ] .",
    "the normal computation mode is used with the standard options , and we obtain normal accuracy conditions ( e.g.  relative efficiency summed over all orders is 1 ) for all calculations reported in this paper .    after an angular or translational misalignment , three parameters relating to diffraction efficiency can change : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and groove period @xmath40 .",
    "characteristic limits on these parameters are @xmath140 arcseconds , @xmath141 arcseconds , and @xmath142 nm , obtained from the roll , pitch , and @xmath55 translation tolerances above .",
    "our goal was to determine bounds on these parameters based on when the diffraction efficiency changes appreciably .",
    "an appreciable change was defined as a @xmath143 rms difference in diffraction efficiency over the 3001500 ev ( 4.10.8 nm ) range . for each parameter of interest ,",
    "the value was shifted away from the nominal value in an iterative process until this change condition was reached .",
    "this was done for both transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarizations .",
    "[ fig : phibounds ] , [ fig : thetabounds ] , and [ fig : dbounds ] show the nominal diffraction efficiency and the diffraction efficiency after the change condition was reached in both the positive and negative direction .",
    "note that the dramatic dependence on polarization is an expected result , and such a dependence has been measured in the past @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the misalignments which result in the 1% rms efficiency change are at least an order of magnitude greater than the characteristic limits given above .",
    "they are also much greater than the pointing stability of a typical x - ray observatory ( @xmath144 arcseconds for _ chandra _ ) .",
    "these results indicate that a single diffraction efficiency curve can be used to determine effective area , and that the effective area ( i.e.  energy response function ) can be assumed to be constant during a telescope pointing .    ) and misaligned @xmath47 . for our angular misalignment tolerances ,",

    "we have shown , using both an analytical and raytracing approach , the alignment tolerances for all six degrees of freedom for an off - plane reflection grating spectrometer .",
    "we have used reasonable nominal alignment assumptions for a flight - like instrument , and have shown that our results scale linearly with focal length and spectral resolution and effective area requirements within realistic ranges .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that for our alignment tolerances , diffraction efficiency can be assumed to be constant . in calculating the tolerance for a given misalignment , this work has assumed perfect alignment for the other five degrees of freedom . in a later paper , we intend to show results of a raytracing algorithm designed to simultaneously incorporate all six alignment degrees of freedom .",
