    "in this section we characterize the instabilities leading to parafermionic zero - modes in a spin - unpolarized @xmath13 quantum hall system , which for reasons elucidated below is a particularly promising platform for the transport anomalies described in the main text .",
    "to begin we summarize the edge theory for this quantum hall state using @xmath70-matrix formalism  @xcite .",
    "the edge modes of the unpolarized @xmath71 state are described by two bosonic fields @xmath72 and an associated @xmath70-matrix @xmath73 and charge vector @xmath74 . in this description ,",
    "the edge electron density is given by @xmath75 and the filling fraction reads @xmath76 .",
    "a trench etched in the quantum hall liquid brings two counterpropagating sets of such modes into close proximity with one another . disregarding tunneling and pairing terms for the moment ,",
    "the lagrangian density for the edge modes opposite the trench is @xmath77 where we have four bosonic fields @xmath78 , two for each side of the trench .",
    "the extended @xmath70-matrix for this doubled system is @xmath79 , while the matrix @xmath80 captures the density - density interactions both within each edge and across the trench .    for simplicity",
    ", we assume the two edges are symmetric and that the interactions are invariant under su(2 ) spin rotations .",
    "( note that an equivalent su(2 ) symmetry _ emerges _ due to disorder in the polarized @xmath13 state  @xcite ; here , however , the su(2 ) symmetry is manifestly that of spin . )",
    "this gives us the generic for m @xmath81 of course the su(2 ) spin symmetry is not guaranteed microscopically . in particular , this symmetry is broken by a zeeman field , which takes the form @xmath82 , with @xmath83 .",
    "this term has scaling dimension 1 , but can be absorbed into @xmath84 via a redefinition @xmath85 .",
    "however , this absorbtion will cause other terms involving @xmath86 to oscillate on the length scale @xmath87 .",
    "next we classify perturbations to eq .",
    "( s[l0 ] ) that can generate instabilities .",
    "there are six types of gap - opening perturbations that are marginal when @xmath88 and density  density interactions between the two edges are absent , _ i.e. _ @xmath89 .",
    "charge hopping and pairing terms each come in two varieties due to spin degeneracy .",
    "we can divide these into perturbations that form either spin singlets or spin triplets across the trench .",
    "in addition , there are marginal perturbations that do not transfer charge but involve singlet or triplet spin correlations across the trench .",
    "these perturbations are listed in table  [ table1 ] , along with their scaling dimensions ( expressed in terms of parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 defined in the caption ) .",
    "singlet hopping & @xmath92 & @xmath93 + triplet hopping & @xmath94 & @xmath95 + singlet pairing & @xmath96 & @xmath97 + triplet pairing & @xmath98 & @xmath99 + neutral singlet&@xmath100&@xmath101 + neutral triplet&@xmath102&@xmath103 +    we now focus our attention on a system in which an ordinary @xmath9-wave superconductor couples to the trench , and therefore proximity - induces singlet pairing .",
    "likewise , we will assume that electron hopping across the trench acts merely to restore the original quantum hall state , rather than introducing additional spin flips .",
    "we therefore choose parameters such that singlet pairing , singlet hopping , and neutral singlet coupling are the dominant perturbations .",
    "note that these terms are unaffected by the zeeman field , while the triplet terms will have oscillating coefficients .",
    "using table  [ table1 ] , we can find a region of parameter space for which all three singlet terms are _ simultaneously _ relevant by simply setting @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "this is reasonable as a physical regime , given that we must have @xmath106 for stability of the individual edges and repulsive interactions will generically give @xmath107 , since @xmath108 is the density - density interaction between charges on the same edge .",
    "likewise @xmath109 represents repulsion between charges of the same spin on opposite edges , and @xmath110 encodes repulsion between charges of opposite spins on opposite edges .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect @xmath111 , and thus @xmath104 .",
    "we shall work in this parameter regime for the remainder of this analysis .",
    "the fact that singlet pairing and direct tunneling across the trench can become simultaneously relevant for the same set of ( reasonable ) parameters is a great virtue of the unpolarized @xmath13 state .",
    "that is , the superconductor can induce a gap along the trench _ under the same conditions in which the @xmath71 state itself would also reform_. this feature is difficult to achieve in other abelian quantum hall states .",
    "[ consider , _",
    "e.g. _ , the @xmath112 state with the same interaction matrix in eq .",
    "( s[vdef ] ) .",
    "here the scaling dimensions for the superconducting and tunneling perturbations respectively read @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "these two terms can not both be made relevant ( _ i.e. _ @xmath115 ) for the same values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 . ]    crucially , although both singlet pairing and hopping terms are relevant at @xmath13 , the gaps favored by these two processes are incompatible with one another .",
    "rather , in any given region of the trench either the pairing _ or _ the hopping mechanism must win out in order for a gap to open .",
    "this is because the ( charge - sector ) fields that these two types of coupling try to pin are dual to one another .",
    "if one of them is pinned , the other must fluctuate . for @xmath116 , though , there is no such issue in the neutral sector_i.e .",
    "_ , all three singlet terms in table [ table1 ] favor gapping the neutral fields in compatible ways . the neutral sector thus gaps out trivially , independent of which mechanism wins out .",
    "as is the case when there is only one type of ( fractional ) edge mode , the boundary between a region of the trench gapped by pairing and one gapped by direct hopping supports a parafermionic zero - energy mode  @xcite . in this case , the zero mode has a @xmath117 character .",
    "the main text describes a number of nontrivial consequences for transport when these ( and other types of zero modes ) are probed with quantum hall edges . as an aside",
    ", we also comment that the unpolarized @xmath71 case may be of particular interest for more traditional topological quantum information applications because of the complete gapping of the neutral sector .",
    "this gap partially inoculates the zero modes here against noise .",
    "in particular , stray electrons _ can not _",
    "directly affect the state of quantum information encoded in these zero modes , because they possess neither the correct charge ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 , or @xmath120 ) nor spin ( always 0 ) to do so ."

    "<S> heterostructures formed by quantum hall systems and superconductors have recently been shown to support widely coveted majorana fermion zero - modes and still more exotic ` parafermionic ' generalizations . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , we demonstrate quite generally that at low energies the zero - modes convert chirally moving quasiparticles into oppositely charged quasiholes propagating in the same direction  that is , they swap the sign of the chiral edge currents . </S>",
    "<S> one may then construct new and potentially useful circuit elements using this ` perfect andreev conversion ' process , including superconducting current and voltage mirrors as well as transistors for fractional charge currents . </S>",
    "<S> characterization of these circuit elements should provide striking evidence of the zero - mode physics .    </S>",
    "<S> * _ introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ *  non - abelian anyons provide a fascinating illustration of anderson s ` more is different ' paradigm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these quasiparticles , which emerge from interacting collections of ordinary bosons and fermions , produce a ground - state degeneracy that scales exponentially with the number of anyons present in the host system . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , braiding the anyons around one another noncommutatively rotates the system s quantum state within this degenerate manifold . </S>",
    "<S> these remarkable properties have led to great interest in non - abelian anyons for use in fault - tolerant quantum information processing devices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our goal here is to propose another application of non - abelian anyons , namely the construction of unusual circuit elements such as transistors for fractional charge , current / voltage mirrors , and flux - based capacitors .    as a primer , </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) topological superconductor @xcite , obtained when an odd - channel wire acquires a bulk pairing gap . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that a 1d superconductor breaks up into alternating topological and trivial domains as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figzeromodes](a ) ( _ e.g. _ , by varying the number of channels spatially along the wire ) . here </S>",
    "<S> the endpoints of the topological regions realize ` ising ' non - abelian anyons , which bind majorana zero - modes that encode a two - fold ground - state degeneracy per topological segment . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the degeneracy reflects the fact that each topological domain can switch its fermion parity without affecting the energy density  contrary to conventional superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> numerous sources of 1d topological superconductivity have been proposed , which involve coupling a bulk superconductor to systems such as two - dimensional ( 2d ) topological insulator edges  @xcite , spin - orbit - coupled nanowires  @xcite , magnetic - atom chains  @xcite , or counterpropagating sets of integer quantum hall edge modes  @xcite ( for reviews see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    among these platforms , </S>",
    "<S> the integer quantum hall architecture most naturally generalizes to fractionalized setups that harbor richer phenomena stemming from the interplay between superconductivity and strong correlations . </S>",
    "<S> consider , for instance , a ` wire ' synthesized from counterpropagating fractional quantum hall edge states separated by a narrow trench [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figzeromodes](b ) for an example at filling @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this ` wire ' can acquire a gap either through electron backscattering across the trench or via cooper pairing . because the edge states support fractionally charged excitations , the ends of pairing - gapped regions correspond to exotic non - abelian anyons binding generalizations of majorana zero - modes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these _ parafermionic _ zero - modes  @xcite encode a larger ground - state degeneracy compared to the usual majorana case , since here each superconducting - gapped region can acquire _ fractional _ charge without changing its energy density . </S>",
    "<S> similar effects may arise in other fractionalized setups  @xcite , including quantum hall bilayers in which interlayer tunneling plays the role of cooper pairing  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we predict novel _ non - local _ transport signatures of majorana and parafermionic zero - modes in quantum hall / superconductor hybrids that , in turn , provide a foundation for the unusual circuit elements mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments we propose relate closely to the ` zero - bias anomaly ' arising when a single - channel normal lead probes a majorana zero - mode in a 1d topological superconductor  @xcite . in such a setup  sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figandreev](a)the majorana mode is predicted to mediate perfect andreev reflection as temperature @xmath1 and bias voltage @xmath2 approach zero . </S>",
    "<S> that is , in this asymptotic limit an incoming electron from the normal lead reflects off of the topological superconductor as a hole with unit probability , yielding a quantized zero - bias conductance of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , this is twice the conductance of an ideal single - channel wire , with the factor of two arising because of the added contribution of the reflected hole .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that quantum hall / superconductor hybrids yield an interesting variation on this transport anomaly , in particular when the native edge states serve as a lead that probes zero - modes generated in such setups . </S>",
    "<S> the basic transport architecture appears in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figandreev](b ) and contains two new features compared to the 1d topological superconductor problem . </S>",
    "<S> first , in the fractional quantum hall case the ( parafermionic ) zero - mode at the outer trench edge mediates perfect conversion of incoming quasiparticles carrying _ fractional _ </S>",
    "<S> charge @xmath4 into @xmath5 quasiholes as @xmath6 , thereby transmitting charge @xmath7 into the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> such events are possible since the pairing - gapped trench can resonantly absorb fractional charge due to the ground - state degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> ( ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite briefly explored an analogous transport phenomenon in a bilayer setup . ) </S>",
    "<S> second  and more importantly  if the ( ungapped ) quantum hall edge used as a lead supports purely chiral charge excitations , the outgoing quasihole continues in the same direction around the edge as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figandreev](b ) illustrates . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this process as _ andreev conversion _ to distinguish it from standard andreev reflection in which the hole retraces the incoming particle s path . </S>",
    "<S> the superconductor and quantum hall edges thus form a trijunction in which the current and voltage in each leg exhibits a strong dynamical constraint . </S>",
    "<S> when multiple superconducting trenches are immersed in the same quantum hall fluid , this dynamical constraint underlies various non - local transport anomalies . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we theoretically establish the perfect andreev conversion noted above under rather general circumstances and then discuss several novel circuit elements that follow .    * _ perfect andreev conversion_. *   one can access the transport phenomena we describe using many different quantum hall phases . </S>",
    "<S> the conceptually simplest corresponds to a @xmath8 integer quantum hall state , though coupling to superconductivity in this case appears non - trivial due to spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the @xmath8 edge mode can arise from the magnetically gapped surface of a 3d topological insulator @xcite . in this realization </S>",
    "<S> one can utilize ordinary @xmath9-wave superconductors ; moreover , orbital magnetic fields are not required . </S>",
    "<S> quantum hall phases with multiple edge channels also suffice . </S>",
    "<S> we will simply require that the edge supports a single , chiral charge mode that at low energies decouples from all other neutral modes . </S>",
    "<S> this decoupling occurs , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , for hierarchical states at @xmath10 ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 are integers ) due to disorder as shown by kane and fisher @xcite . among this series the spin - unpolarized @xmath13 state is particularly advantageous , in part because here too one can induce pairing via an @xmath9-wave superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> another virtue is that the instabilities leading to the zero - modes occur at weak coupling for a range of realistic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we expound on this important technical point in the supplementary information , which explores the @xmath13 case in greater detail </S>",
    "<S> .    suppose that we etch a trench into a quantum hall system and then fill the void with a superconductor as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figandreev](b ) . provided the trench width does not exceed the superconductor s coherence length , the proximity effect can then gap out the adjacent edge modes through cooper pairing . </S>",
    "<S> as noted earlier one thereby creates zero - modes at the ends of the trench that encode a ground - state degeneracy for the intervening pairing - gapped region . </S>",
    "<S> we will now explore transport resulting when the gapless chiral charge mode impinging on the trench hybridizes with one of these zero - modes .    </S>",
    "<S> the key physical mechanism is that at low energies the gapped trench imposes certain boundary conditions that relate incoming and outgoing quasiparticles from the adjacent gapless edge . </S>",
    "<S> consider first the limit in which the gapless edge state completely decouples from the superconducting trench . </S>",
    "<S> concretely , one could envision adding near the boundary a small tunneling - gapped region as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figzeromodes](b ) to block coupling to the zero - mode . in this case </S>",
    "<S> incoming quasiparticles continue along the edge uninterrupted by the trench , and the action governing the charge mode of interest is simply that of an unperturbed edge @xcite : @xmath14 with @xmath15 a field that determines the total edge charge density through @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> commutation relations implicit in the action imply that @xmath17 is an operator that adds charge @xmath18 . throughout </S>",
    "<S> we assume that this charge mode decouples from all neutral modes  should any exist . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ lcharge ] ) describes a fixed point for the edge at which particles undergo ` perfect normal transmission ' upon hitting the trench .    </S>",
    "<S> next we incorporate weak coupling to the zero - mode nearest to the edge , which allows charge @xmath4 to pass between the gapless edge and the pairing - gapped region . </S>",
    "<S> such processes perturb the above fixed - point action with a term @xmath19 ,    \\label{deltal}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the position where the trench and gapless charge mode intersect , @xmath21 denotes the bare coupling strength , and @xmath22 is an operator that cycles the charge on the pairing - gapped region of the trench by @xmath4 ( mod @xmath23 ) . under renormalization </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 flows according to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a logarithmic rescaling factor and @xmath26 is the scaling dimension of the tunneling operator in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ deltal ] ) . for @xmath27to which we specialize hereafter  hybridization with the zero - mode thus constitutes a relevant perturbation that destabilizes the perfect normal transmission fixed point .    </S>",
    "<S> the system then flows to a different fixed point at which coupling to the zero - mode imposes nontrivial boundary conditions on the gapless charge mode at @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this boundary condition can be expressed as @xmath29 with @xmath30 denoting gapless charge - sector fields evaluated just above and below the trench . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ eqboundary ] ) causes incoming charge-@xmath4 quasiparticles ( @xmath17 ) _ added relative to the superconductor s potential _ to continue as outgoing @xmath5 quasiholes ( @xmath31 ) , with the pairing - gapped trench absorbing the deficit charge @xmath7 ( @xmath32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely the andreev conversion process described earlier . </S>",
    "<S> there is , however , a competing effect , whereby electrons tunnel directly past the trench . </S>",
    "<S> we now address the relevance of these processes at the ` perfect andreev conversion ' fixed point defined by the boundary condition in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqboundary ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> any perturbation that tunnels an electron _ past _ the trench takes the form @xmath33    </S>",

    "<S> the scaling dimension of the above electron tunneling term reads @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the scaling dimension of @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , any operator that transfers electron charge across the trench has @xmath39 and is hence irrelevant for @xmath40implying stability of the perfect andreev conversion fixed point in the regime of interest . </S>",
    "<S> as well in eq.([stunneling ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath41 , implying instability of the andreev fixed point when @xmath42 ( where the normal fixed point is stable ) . ] numerous interesting consequences for transport follow from this general result .    * _ doubled hall voltage . _ *  consider again the setup of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figandreev](b ) , where a normal electrode at potential @xmath2 injects charge along the lower quantum hall edge towards a grounded superconducting trench . </S>",
    "<S> we temporarily assume negligible contact resistances ; the lower edge is then also at potential @xmath2 . for ` small ' </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 ( quantified below ) , injected charge undergoes perfect andreev conversion at the trench . </S>",
    "<S> thus the conductance @xmath43 _ doubles _ compared to a standard two - terminal measurement_i.e . </S>",
    "<S> _ , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the hall conductance . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath8 the physics essentially maps to the 1d topological superconductor case described earlier , modulo the spatial separation of incoming and outgoing modes .    </S>",
    "<S> the potential on the upper quantum hall edge , where the outgoing andreev - converted carriers flow , follows from current conservation . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , since the same current @xmath46 passing through the superconductor traverses the quantum hall fluid , the current must additionally satisfy @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the hall voltage ) . </S>",
    "<S> consistency requires that the hall voltage , like the conductance , is also doubled compared to the case where both source and drain are normal electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the potential on the upper edge is @xmath49 , opposite that of the lower edge . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that _ the andreev - converted carriers do not equilibrate with the superconductor _ ; rather equilibration occurs at the normal electrode in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figandreev](b ) .    consider next the more general situation where the potential for the superconductor is @xmath50 and that of the incoming / outgoing quantum hall edges is @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> due to the doubled conductance the current flowing out of the superconductor is @xmath52 , while the ( same ) current crossing the hall fluid obeys @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that @xmath54 which we will frequently employ in the forthcoming discussion . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ stunneling ] ) ] remain inoperative ; this is the regime where perfect andreev conversion holds . </S>",

    "<S> in general , @xmath57 , where the quality factor @xmath58 ranges between 0 ( no contact ) and 2 ( ideal superconducting contact ) . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that if both electrodes were normal , @xmath58 could never exceed @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> unless otherwise stated , we will assume ideal superconducting contacts in the devices described below to emphasize their unusual behavior .    * _ transistor for fractional charge . </S>",
    "<S> _ *  figure  [ fig0transformer ] illustrates a simple example of non - local effects resulting when multiple superconducting trenches appear in the quantum hall system . here , all superconductors are set to the same potential . </S>",
    "<S> unlike in the josephson effect , their relative phases are inconsequential  we assume that any notion of phase coherence is lost along the edges connecting the leads . </S>",

    "<S> characterization of these circuit elements is therefore a natural first step in the pursuit of topological quantum computation with such systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another tantalizing application is the construction of low - power logical circuits . </S>",
    "<S> these circuits would have an advantage in the control of low - temperature quantum information devices , as they would coexist within the same low - temperature environment . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the implementation , it may also be possible to produce such logical circuits ` on - chip ' with quantum information implementations already based on 2d - electron gas and/or superconducting elements . </S>",
    "<S> these applications likely extend to alternative setups as well . </S>",
    "<S> the topological - insulator - based interferometers proposed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite yield a related mechanism for perfect andreev conversion , and thus should also form the backbone of nontrivial circuit elements . </S>",
    "<S> quantum hall bilayers ( _ without _ superconductivity ) provide another promising venue . </S>",
    "<S> novel dc transformers were proposed in this context a decade ago  @xcite , and given that a bilayer variant of andreev conversion is already theoretically established @xcite other interesting elements are likely also possible .    * _ acknowledgements . _ *   we are indebted to j.  p.  eisenstein , m.  p.  a.  fisher , c.  nayak and a.  stern for numerous enlightening discussions . we also acknowledge funding from the nsf through grants dmr-1341822 ( d.  j.  c. & j.  a. ) and dmr-0748925 ( k.  s. ) ; the alfred p.  sloan foundation ( j.  a. ) ; the darpa quest program ( k.  s. ) ; and the caltech institute for quantum information and matter , an nsf physics frontiers center with support of the gordon and betty moore foundation .    </S>",
