    "<S> the fourth harmonic of the azimuthal distribution of particles @xmath0 has been measured for au - au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) . </S>",
    "<S> the centrality dependence of @xmath0 does not agree with the prediction from hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the ratio @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the second harmonic of the azimuthal distribution of particles , is significantly larger than predicted by hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this discrepancy is mostly due to elliptic flow ( @xmath2 ) fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate these fluctuations on the basis of a monte carlo glauber calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of deviations from local thermal equilibrium is also studied , but appears to be only a small correction . </S>",
    "<S> combining these two effects allows us to reproduce experimental data for peripheral and midcentral collisions . </S>",
    "<S> however , we are unable to explain the large magnitude of @xmath1 observed for the most central collisions .    introduction    the azimuthal distribution of emitted particles is a good tool for understanding the bulk properties of the matter created in non central nucleus - nucleus collisions . in the center of mass rapidity region , it can be expanded in fourier series : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the azimuthal angle with respect to the direction of the impact parameter , and odd harmonics are zero by symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the large magnitude of elliptic flow @xmath2 observed at rhic suggests that the matter created in au - au collisions behaves like an almost perfect fluid . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent experiments  @xcite observe that , at midrapidity and fixed @xmath5 , @xmath6 , while ideal hydrodynamics predicts that @xmath7  @xcite . in this talk , </S>",
    "<S> i investigate this discrepancy .    </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations in initial conditions     axis defines the reaction plane while the @xmath8 axis is the minor axis of the ellipse drawn by the participating nucleons ( grey dots ) . </S>",
    "<S> , width=230 ]    figure  [ fig : fig1 ] presents a schematic picture of a non central heavy - ion collision ( hic ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap area of the nuclei has an almond shape , which generates elliptic flow . </S>",
    "<S> however , the matter is not continuously distributed in a nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of the nucleons in the colliding nucleus are important : they also draw an ellipse which differs from the overlap area both in eccentricity and in orientation . from one event to the other , even at fixed impact parameter , </S>",
    "<S> the positions of the nucleons in the nucleus fluctuate . </S>",
    "<S> the participant plane eccentricity ( @xmath9 ) , defined as the eccentricity of the ellipse drawn by the participating nucleons  @xcite , thus fluctuates . since elliptic flow appears to be driven by this participant plane eccentricity , these eccentricity fluctuations translate into fluctuations of the flow coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath0  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> modeling eccentricity fluctuations    the initial distribution of energy , which is needed to compute the initial eccentricity in a hic , is poorly known . in this talk i use a specific model , based on a monte carlo glauber ( mcg ) calculation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the initial eccentricity is given for each event by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the @xmath13 denote averages over participating nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> each participant nucleon is given a weight proportional to the number of particles it creates , according to the two - component picture : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of binary collisions of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of weights scales like the multiplicity : @xmath16.\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the number of participants and of binary collisions of the considered event . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the value @xmath19 which best describes the charged hadron multiplicity observed experimentally  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we define the centrality according to the number of participants . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate eccentricity fluctuations in centrality classes containing @xmath20 of the total number of events . </S>",
    "<S> we do not introduce any hard core repulsion between nucleons in the mcg .    </S>",
    "<S> how eccentricity fluctuations affect @xmath21 .    : </S>",
    "<S> data from star  @xcite and phenix  @xcite ; error bars on star data points are our estimates of nonflow errors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lines are predictions from ideal hydro with or without fluctuations.,width=259 ]    there is no direct measure of the flow coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> they can be obtained using different analysis methods . </S>",
    "<S> the one i will consider now relies on azimuthal correlations between particles near midrapidity . experimentally , @xmath2 can be extracted from the 2-particle correlation and @xmath0 from the 3-particle correlation using @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where angular brackets denote an average value within a centrality class . </S>",
    "<S> thus , any experimental measure of @xmath21 obtained using this method is rather a measure of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the ideal hydrodynamics prediction @xmath7  @xcite , we obtain : @xmath25 assuming that @xmath2 scales like the participant plane eccentricity @xmath9 , the effects of fluctuations on @xmath21 is obtained by computing : @xmath26 the resulting prediction for @xmath21 is displayed in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations clearly explain most of the difference between hydro and data . </S>",
    "<S> it also appears that experimental data are still slightly higher than our prediction from fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> however , these predictions are based on a specific parametrization of the initial conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> flow fluctuations from experimental data    , additional points ( labeled `` fluct . from @xmath2 '' ) are obtained using equation  ( [ v24value ] ) with @xmath27 from @xcite and @xmath28 from @xcite.,width=259 ]    another possible way of evaluating flow fluctuations is to compare the values of @xmath2 obtained using different analysis methods . </S>",
    "<S> elliptic flow can be obtained from both @xmath29-particle cumulants ( @xmath28 ) and from @xmath30-particle cumulants ( @xmath27 ) using @xmath31 ( neglecting the non - flow contribution ) and @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> inverting the last equation leads to : @xmath33    the values of @xmath21 obtained using this method are displayed on figure  [ fig : fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> they overshoot slightly our results from mcg eccentricity fluctuations , but the overall agreement remains good . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a good check of our mcg prediction . </S>",
    "<S> a small residual discrepancy remains between our prediction and the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that for peripheral to midcentral collisions , it may be understood in terms of deviations from local thermal equilibrium .    </S>",
    "<S> partial thermalization effects so far , i have only discussed how fluctuations in initial conditions modify the prediction from ideal hydrodynamics for @xmath21 . but </S>",
    "<S> ideal hydrodynamics relies on the very strong assumption that the system remains in local thermal equilibrium ( a regime where the average number of collisions per particle @xmath34 is large ) throughout the evolution . in a previous work  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have shown that , in order to reproduce the centrality dependence of elliptic flow , the deviation from local thermal equilibrium must be taken into account ( @xmath35 would be a typical value for au - au collisions at the top rhic energy ) .     with the knudsen number.,width=355 ]    qualitatively , in the limit of small @xmath34 ( far from equilibrium ) , one expects both @xmath2 and @xmath0 to scale like @xmath34 , so that @xmath1 scales like @xmath36 : we thus expect that the farther the system from equilibrium , the larger @xmath1  @xcite . in order to have a more quantitative estimate of the effects of partial thermalization </S>",
    "<S> , we use a @xmath37-dimensional solution of the relativistic boltzmann equation to study systems with arbitrary @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the knudsen number  @xcite , @xmath38 , as a measure of the degree of thermalization of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig4 ] displays the dependence of @xmath1 with the knudsen number . in the limit @xmath39 , </S>",
    "<S> transport results show that @xmath40 , which is close to @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe , as expected from the low @xmath34 limit , that increasing @xmath42 leads to an increase of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> but this effect is only a small correction .     </S>",
    "<S> ( right ) , with one additional curve showing the effect of the deviation from local equilibrium.,width=259 ]    the effects of partial thermalization on the centrality dependence of @xmath43 are displayed on figure  [ fig : fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the knudsen number needed for this plot are borrowed from a previous study  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows that adding the effects of deviation from local thermal equilibrium to the fluctuations , our prediction overshoots slightly the data for midcentral and peripheral collisions , but the overall agreement is good . </S>",
    "<S> we do not yet understand the large value of @xmath1 for central collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> conclusion    to conclude , i would like to recall three points : 1 ) @xmath0 is mainly induced by @xmath2 ; 2 ) the deviation from local equilibrium has a small effect on @xmath1 ; 3 ) eccentricity fluctuations explain the observed values of @xmath1 , except for the most central collisions which require further investigation . </S>"
