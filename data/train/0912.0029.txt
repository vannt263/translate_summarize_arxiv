    "in the present paper we calculate photon distribution amplitudes ( da ) within a low energy nonlocal model based on the instanton model of the qcd vacuum .",
    "there are seven different photon das corresponding to the dirac structure probing the photon and to the light - cone twist ( here we follow closely definitions of ref .",
    "however in reality only one of them , twist 2 tensor da , can be accessed experimentally in hard exclusive processes @xcite ( for experimental overview see ref .",
    "higher twist amplitudes are suppressed in hard processes and vector twist 2 da decouples for real photons . however , the interest in the remaining photon das is not purely academical .",
    "they are normalized through low energy observables such as quark condensate ",
    "@xmath0 , magnetic susceptibility  @xmath1 and mixed quark - gluon condensate ",
    "@xmath2 that are of importance for our understanding of the properties of the qcd vacuum .",
    "only the calculation of all photon das provides a test of the whole approach and may prove its consistency .    in the present work we employ a nonlocal generalization of the semibosonized nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with momentum dependent constituent quark mass @xmath3 ( which will be denoted as @xmath4 ) which follows from the instanton model of the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "this model in the present version has been previously used to calculate pion @xcite and kaon @xcite distribution amplitudes , two pion das @xcite , pion - to - photon transition distribution amplitudes @xcite and also twist 2 tensor photon da @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however a complete analysis of all seven photon das has been , to the best of our knowledge , conducted only in ref .",
    "@xcite in a model similar to ours with , however , results that in some respects are different than the ones obtained in the present paper .",
    "one of the obvious problems that arises when one considers momentum dependent fermion mass is the nonconservation of the naive vector current containing only @xmath5 dirac matrix .",
    "there are many proposals in the literature how to extend vector current to satisfy electromagnetic ward identities .",
    "none of them is unique , since current conservation does not fix the transverse part of the modified vertex .",
    "one of the simplest extensions of this type discussed already many years ago in refs .",
    "@xcite and employed also in ref .",
    "@xcite , consists in the following substitution@xmath6 extension ( [ eq : vertex ] ) follows from the assumption concerning both ward identities and analytical structure of the modified vertex that is required to match perturbative expansion . in principle",
    "one could add to ( [ eq : vertex ] ) terms proportional to @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and the ward identities would be satisfied . in refs .",
    "@xcite and also in @xcite another modification has been advocated ; here the ambiguity is connected to a freedom of choosing the integration path that defines the nonlocal vertex . in view of this ambiguous situation",
    "we have decided to use the simplest possible extension of ref .",
    "@xcite given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex ] ) .",
    "unlike the pion or the @xmath9 meson the photon has a dual nature being both point - like and composite at the same time . therefore in order to calculate photon das that describe nonperturbative quark - antiquark structures , one has to subtract the perturbative part . in order to avoid ambiguities this procedure has to be well defined . in our case , since we work in the chiral limit , we subtract the perturbative part only from these photon das that are nonzero for massless quarks .",
    "these are : vector and axial das which are also uv divergent .",
    "therefore the subtraction of the perturbative part renormalizes these das ensuring their finiteness . at the same time it introduces a term proportional to @xmath10 that develops imaginary part for positive virtualities",
    "this is the reflection of the fact that the photon can decay into free massless quarks in the chirally even channels . throughout this paper",
    "we plot das both for negative and positive photon virtualities , in the latter case we take just the real part if the imaginary part exists .",
    "we also display momentum dependence of the pertinent decay constants that are characterized by dimensionless functions @xmath11 for brevity referred to as form factors .",
    "finally let us make a technical remark concerning loop integrals over @xmath12 with @xmath13 component fixed by the @xmath14 function .",
    "such integrals , depending on the tensor structure may contain `` singular '' pieces proportional to @xmath15 and @xmath16 or even the derivatives of the @xmath14 functions .",
    "this is the case for higher twist photon das only .",
    "we discuss this in more detail in sect .",
    "[ loopi ] , here we just want to point out that higher twist das are in fact distributions rather than ordinary functions . quite importantly , the @xmath14 function contribution is always accompanied by a regular piece that together with the @xmath14 piece integrates to zero for any @xmath17 .",
    "this allows to define a properly normalized regular part and a singular part of da of zero norm .    in the next section",
    "we introduce kinematical variables and define photon distribution amplitudes . in sect .",
    "[ nonlo ] we describe the main features of our model specifying the ansatz for the momentum dependence of the constituent quark mass .",
    "we fix model parameters requiring that the experimental value of the pion decay constant @xmath18  mev is reproduced . to this end",
    "we use model formula given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpi ] ) .",
    "next , in sect .",
    "[ loopi ] , we describe techniques used to calculate loop integrals with momentum dependent constituent quark mass .",
    "we pay special attention to lorentz invariance and show how the end point singularities proportional to the dirac @xmath14 functions arise .",
    "main results are presented in sect .",
    "[ photo ] .",
    "first we calculate dimensional constants entering definitions of the das ( [ eq : def_tensor])([eq : def_axial ] ) , namely quark condensate , magnetic susceptibility and yet another constant , called @xmath2 .",
    "we obtain numerical results that agree with the `` experimental '' values known from phenomenology .",
    "finally in sections [ leadi ] and [ highe ] we present our main results plotting different das and discussing their properties .",
    "our results can be briefly summarized as follows .",
    "leading twist amplitudes are rather insensitive to model parameters , whereas higher twist amplitudes exhibit much stronger dependence , moreover some of them contain @xmath14 functions .",
    "we also show the influence of the nonlocal part of the photon vertex ( [ eq : vertex ] ) on the shape of photon das . for some das",
    "it is rather unimportant , for the other ones it is absolutely crucial .",
    "more discussion and comparison with other models is given in sect .",
    "[ summa ] .",
    "technical details are collected in appendices .",
    "photon distribution amplitudes are defined through matrix elements of the nonlocal quark - antiquark billinears between vacuum and one photon state .",
    "quark operators are assumed to be on the light cone separated by the distance @xmath19 . in the following we use the light - cone",
    "coordinates defined by two light like vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "depending on different tensor nature of the bilocal operators , we can define tensor@xmath35 vector@xmath36 and axial vector@xmath37 distribution amplitudes . for compactness we used notation @xmath38 where @xmath39 is longitudinal fraction of the quark momentum and dropped wilson lines @xmath40   $ ] that ensure gauge invariance of the nonlocal operators . in the light - cone",

    "moreover , since we use an effective model where gluonic fields are integrated out , wilson lines corresponding to gluon fields never appear .",
    "our definitions follow closely those of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , however we need only one @xmath43dependent dimensionless form factor for each tensor structure : @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 where subscripts @xmath47 and @xmath48 stay for vector , tensor and axial vector , respectively . constant @xmath1 is the magnetic susceptibility of the quark condensate @xmath0 , and @xmath2 corresponds to the axial mixed quark - gluon condensate .",
    "they provide natural mass scales for distribution amplitudes .",

    "we have distributions of twist-2 : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , of twist-3 : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and of twist-4 : @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "this can be easily seen by inspecting eqs .",
    "- , since the twist counting actually reduces to counting the powers of @xmath57 .",
    "notice that in the case of axial distribution the power of @xmath57 equals @xmath58 , what would correspond to twist-2 , however additionally there is a path stretch @xmath59 with inverse mass dimensionality that makes @xmath54 to have twist 3 rather than 2 .",
    "constants @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 are chosen in such a way that the following normalization conditions are satisfied@xmath60@xmath61    note that due to the conservation of vector current @xmath62 . on the other hand @xmath63 .",
    "normalization of the axial form factor @xmath64 is arbitrary and depends on the dimensional constant used in definition ( [ eq : def_axial ] ) .",
    "in order to calculate relevant matrix elements in the low energy domain we shall use effective action based on the instanton vacuum theory @xcite .",
    "its main feature is momentum dependent constituent quark mass @xmath65 appearing due to the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this dependence enters not only into propagators , but serves as a nonlocal quark - meson coupling as well . for zero momentum",
    "@xmath66 is of order of @xmath67 , while for @xmath68 constituent quark mass vanishes @xmath69 .",
    "one has to remember that the semibosonized njl model , although devised to describe chiral physics of goldstone bosons , has been widely used to incorporate baryons as chiral solitons both in local ( for review see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) and non - local @xcite cases .",
    "generally the results of these studies show that the soliton ceases to exist for too small constituent quark mass @xmath70 .",
    "the critical value of @xmath70 depends on the details of the given model , however it is of the order of 300 mev or a bit less .",
    "typical values of @xmath70 that fit well the hyperon spectrum may be as high as 420 mev @xcite . in order to investigate dependence of photon das on @xmath70 we use three distinct values of @xmath70 : 300 , 350 and 400 mev .    due to the momentum dependence of the quark mass ,",
    "the naive vector current @xmath71 violates electromagnetic ward identities . in order to fix this",
    "deficiency new nonlocal terms have to be added to @xmath72 . as already discussed in the introduction",
    "there are several ways of constructing extensions that make the current conserved . in the present paper",
    "we use the simplest possible generalization of the vector current , @xcite replacing @xmath5 by an effective vertex of ( [ eq : vertex ] ) .",
    "one can easily check that electromagnetic ward identities are satisfied when ( [ eq : vertex ] ) is used instead of @xmath5 .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex ] ) introduces an extra pole inside feynman amplitudes , its residue , as we will explicitly show , is zero due to the mass difference in the numerator .",
    "this generalization of the vector current has been widely used in the literature also in the context of the photon das @xcite .",
    "expression for the form factor @xmath73 within instanton vacuum model is known analytically in euclidean space and is highly nontrivial @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to perform analytical calculations directly in minkowski space , we use the following formula @xcite@xmath74 where @xmath75 is cutoff parameter adjusted for each @xmath76 in such a way , that the experimental value of the pion decay constant is reproduced . for transparency",
    "we shall skip subscript @xmath76 and use @xmath77 rather than @xmath78 in the following .",
    "equation reproduces reasonably well original shape @xmath73 when continued to euclidean momentum .",
    "it should be however pointed out that expression does not follow the exponential asymptotics of @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "parameter @xmath76 is introduced in order to check sensitivity of our results to the shape of @xmath79 .    in order to fix the model parameter @xmath77 we use the following euclidean expression for the weak pion decay constant @xcite:@xmath80 where @xmath81 .",

    "in this section we present a brief sketch of our calculations underlying the most important steps .",
    "further technicalities are relegated to appendices . in order to calculate the da of interest  denoted generically as @xmath92",
    " we have to invert formulae ( [ eq : def_tensor])([eq : def_axial ] ) by contracting them with appropriate 4-vectors and by performing fourier transform in @xmath59 .",
    "this results in the following formulae@xmath93 where @xmath94 is the constant obtained by the contraction , @xmath95 is the contracted tensor structure defining given amplitude and@xmath96 stands for the dirac trace .",
    "note that in the case of axial da , because of @xmath59 standing in the l.h.s . of ( [ eq",
    ": def_axial])@xmath97 since some of the integrals can be uv divergent we shall work in @xmath98 dimensions .",
    "previous calculations using present nonlocal model were done by integration in the light - cone coordinates , with special care concerning the integration contour to ensure analyticity in @xmath75 . here we present another method of performing such integrals based on the @xmath99-representation for the propagators .",
    "it is especially useful in the case of integrals appearing in higher twist distributions , because of the end point delta - type singularities , which are cumbersome to treat by integration in the light - cone coordinates .",
    "the above complication can be well illustrated by considering a loop integral of the type ( [ loop ] ) for the numerator involving @xmath100 .",
    "if not for the @xmath14 function it would have been proportional to @xmath101 but because @xmath102 we have@xmath103 where @xmath104 is some scalar function involving @xmath76 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "there is an obvious condition following from lorentz invariance@xmath107 however , as mentioned above and as shown explicitly in appendix [ light ] function @xmath108 contains both regular piece and the piece with delta functions : @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "the integrals with tensor structure @xmath113 are even more complicated , since they involve derivatives of @xmath14 functions .    as it was already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite momentum mass dependence given by introduces a set of poles , whose positions depend on parameter @xmath77 . to this end",
    "it is convenient to introduce dimensionless scaled variables@xmath114 and to define@xmath115 then the loop integral involving two propagators , like the one in .",
    "( [ loop1 ] ) , is transformed into@xmath116 where the numerator @xmath117 depends on the da considered .",
    "here@xmath118 corresponds to the propagator with momentum dependent mass ( for @xmath119 it reduces to the ordinary propagator in scaled variables ) where the complex numbers @xmath120 are roots of polynomial @xmath121 to be obtained numerically .",
    "next we decompose the inverse product of @xmath122 into a sum of simple poles@xmath123 with@xmath124 in this way integral ( [ loop2 ] ) is reduced to the sum of contributions involving two propagators only .",
    "it is convenient to use the @xmath125-representation ( exponential schwinger representation ) for the product of propagators since also the @xmath14 function in ( [ loop2 ] ) can be written as an exponent .",
    "further calculations are rather standard and are summarized in appendix [ light ] . as a result we obtain analytical expressions given as sums over roots @xmath126 .",
    "certain simplifications occur when we use the following identity ( which is true for any set of complex numbers @xmath127 not only for the solutions of @xmath128):@xmath129 the proof of ( [ eq : ident ] ) and other useful identities can be found in appendix [ ident ] .    some of the loop diagrams discussed above are uv divergent and require renormalization .",
    "this results in the subtraction of the perturbative part which is uninteresting from the point of view of the hadronic component of the photon . to illustrate this problem consider loop integral ( [ loop2 ] ) with @xmath130 . performing @xmath131 integration",
