    "thus , in both cases @xmath345 , and from  ( [ eq : g2e ] ) we have @xmath346 it follows from  ( [ eq : goverg ] ) that @xmath347 we see from  ( [ eq : goverg ] ) or  ( [ eq : goverg2 ] ) that , as claimed above , @xmath306 is a rational function .",
    "it has zeros at @xmath348 , @xmath349 ; and poles at @xmath348 , @xmath350 . from  ( [ eq : g2.6 ] ) and  ( [ eq : goverg2 ] ) , taking a square root",

    "if  ( [ eq : geng ] ) is regarded as an exact expression for @xmath164 , then the sign of the square root is positive for real @xmath34 , because @xmath164 and @xmath1 have no real roots , and the exponential never vanishes , so a change in sign would contradict the continuity of @xmath164 .",
    "an extension of this argument shows that the same branch of the square root must be taken in any simply - connected , closed region which does not contain any of the zeros of @xmath1 .",
    "( we omit similar comments below . )",
    "consider the case @xmath82 .",
    "we expand the right side of  ( [ eq : gf2b ] ) as a power series in @xmath34 , keeping enough terms to find @xmath363 without using symmetry . from section  [ subsec : ex ]",
    "we have @xmath364 so @xmath365 also ,",
    "@xmath366 so @xmath367 and @xmath368 which is @xmath369 as expected .",
    "we can ignore the @xmath370 term ( which in fact vanishes ) since we know that @xmath371 .",
    "a reader who attempts similar computations for larger @xmath4 will soon be convinced that algorithm  d of section  [ subsec : algsab ] is more convenient , if only because all intermediate results are integers and there is an easy check on the accuracy of the inner product accumulations .    using  ( [ eq : hn3][eq : hn1 ] ) and the fact ( an immediate consequence of  ( [ eq : phirec ] ) ) that @xmath372 we can verify that  ( [ eq : goverg ] ) and  ( [ eq : goverg2][eq : gf3b ] ) give sensible results in the case @xmath35 .",
    "for example , we have @xmath373 , so @xmath374 and @xmath375 .",
    "thus  ( [ eq : gf2b ] ) gives the correct value @xmath376 of @xmath377 .",
    "we now consider the analogues of  ( [ eq : gf2][eq : gf3 ] ) for the lucas polynomials @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the argument is similar to that of section  [ subsec : ab ] , but simpler because the polynomial @xmath190 is symmetric , which leads to the simple functional equation  ( [ eq : gcont ] ) for @xmath304 .",

    "we deduce the functional equation  ( [ eq : gcont ] ) , which gives the analytic continuation of @xmath304 outside the unit circle .",
    "we may also write  ( [ eq : gl1 ] ) more simply as @xmath380 from  ( [ eq : a4.7 ] ) and  ( [ eq : gl2 ] ) , taking a square root , we obtain @xmath381            in this section we illustrate how the results of sections  [ subsec : algscd ] and  [ subsec : cd ] can be used to obtain factors of integers of the form @xmath38 .",
    "our examples are for illustrative purposes , so are small enough to be verified by hand .",
    "many larger examples can be found in  @xcite .    as usual , @xmath0 is a square - free integer .",
    "recall the definition of @xmath68 from section  [ subsec : no ] .",
    "note that the polynomial @xmath68 is a factor of @xmath41 ( where the sign is `` @xmath389 '' if @xmath182 , and `` @xmath390 '' otherwise ) .",
    "if @xmath34 has the form @xmath391 , where @xmath40 is a positive integer , then @xmath392 is an integer , and the aurifeuillian factors @xmath393 give integer factors of @xmath68 , and hence of @xmath394 .",
    "for example , if @xmath395 , we obtain factors of @xmath396 .",
    "more generally , if @xmath397 is rational , we obtain rational factors of @xmath398 , and thus integer factors of @xmath399 .",
    "we consider one example later , but for the moment we continue to assume that @xmath40 is an integer .",
    "let @xmath40 , @xmath4 be positive integers , @xmath0 square - free , @xmath39 , and @xmath401 .",
    "then the aurifeuillian factors @xmath402 of @xmath68 are given by @xmath403 and @xmath404 where @xmath405 [ thm : ta ]    from  ( [ eq : aufacs ] ) , using the functional equation  ( [ eq : gcont ] ) and the power series  ( [ eq : g ] ) for @xmath406 , we have @xmath407 thus , we only have to show that the error incurred by truncating the power series after @xmath408 terms is less than @xmath409 in absolute value , i.e.  that @xmath410 .",
    "let @xmath419 since @xmath420 , @xmath421 , @xmath418 , and the jacobi symbol is 0 or @xmath202 , we have @xmath422 so @xmath423 in particular , @xmath424 , so @xmath425 now @xmath426 , so @xmath427 applying lemma  [ lemma : lb ] of section  [ subsec : cyclo ] with @xmath428 gives @xmath429 but @xmath430 and @xmath74 is the smaller factor of @xmath64 , so @xmath431 from  ( [ eq : ina][eq : inc ] ) we finally obtain the bound @xmath432 which completes the proof .    since the argument of the exponential in theorem  [ thm : ta ] is @xmath433 as @xmath434 , we have the following result , which sheds some light on the ratio of the aurifeuillian factors .",
    "( the corollary strictly follows from theorem  [ thm : ta ] only if @xmath40 is an integer , but from the proof of theorem  [ thm : ta ] it is clear that the corollary is also valid for rational @xmath40 . )",
    "let @xmath39 where @xmath435 is rational @xmath0 is an integer .",
    "consider @xmath40 fixed as @xmath434 through square - free values .",
    "then the aurifeuillian factors @xmath402 of @xmath68 satisfy @xmath436 [ cor : ca ]    to start with a simple example , consider @xmath65 , @xmath437 , so @xmath438 and @xmath415 . in theorem",
    "[ thm : ta ] we have @xmath439 , @xmath440 and rounding to the nearest integer gives the factor  5 of 65 .",
    "a similar but less trivial example is @xmath65 , @xmath441 , @xmath442 . here",
    "@xmath443 and @xmath444 which on rounding gives the factor @xmath445 of @xmath446 .",
    "by division we find @xmath447 , so the complete factorization is @xmath448 .",
    "now consider @xmath92 , @xmath449 , so @xmath450 and @xmath451 . in this case",
    "@xmath452 @xmath453 and rounding to the nearest integer gives the factor  1471 of @xmath454 . by division",
    "we obtain the other factor  2851 . in this example , but not in general , the aurifeuillian factors are prime .",
    "*  now consider a composite @xmath4 , say @xmath82 . to keep the arithmetic easy we take @xmath412 ,",
    "so @xmath455 and @xmath456 the example in section  [ subsec : algscd ] shows how we can use algorithm  l to compute @xmath457 and @xmath458 evaluating the polynomials , we find @xmath459 so the aurifeuillian factors of @xmath460 are @xmath461 .",
    "this gives 19231 and 142111 , which can easily be verified to be factors of @xmath462 .",
    "the `` algebraic '' factors @xmath463 and @xmath464 allow us to complete the factorization : @xmath465    alternatively , instead of evaluating @xmath466 and @xmath467 , we can use theorem  [ thm : ta ] .",
    "we have @xmath468 .",
    "since @xmath469 and @xmath470 , the computation gives @xmath471 and rounding to the nearest integer gives the factor  19231 of @xmath460 .",
    "* 5 . *  to conclude , we give an example where @xmath397 is rational but not an integer .",
    "consider @xmath472 , @xmath473 , @xmath474 , so @xmath475 and @xmath476 .",
    "we have @xmath477 theorem  [ thm : ta ] is not applicable . because @xmath34 is close to 1 , the series for @xmath478 converges rather slowly , and we need to take at least 35 terms to obtain sufficient accuracy .",
    "however , using algorithm  l we easily find that @xmath479 so horner s rule gives @xmath480 and @xmath481 gives @xmath482 and @xmath483 .",
    "thus , we have obtained factors 296507 and 1247 of @xmath484 .",
