    "this paper is devoted to the analysis of thermodynamical states on complex networks with pure hopping hamiltonian , in particular of those exhibiting bose  einstein condensation ( bec for short ) . here",
    "the network is described by an infinite topological graph , and the pure hopping hamiltonian is given , up to an additive constant , by the non diagonal part of the combinatorial laplace operator on the graph ( the hopping part ) .",
    "the general setting considered here is that of bosons on a lattice , described by canonical commutation relations on a suitable dense subspace of @xmath0 , see @xcite for references .",
    "the study of bec on infinite graphs with pure hopping hamiltonian , in particular for the so called comb graph ( see fig .  [ fig8 ] ) ,    started with a series of papers ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) motivated by the relevance of the comb graphs in describing physical phenomena such as arrays of josephson junctions , and then continued in @xcite .",
    "as observed in @xcite , the simultaneous choice of an inhomogeneous graph ( the comb graph ) and of the pure hopping hamiltonian can produce the so called  hidden spectrum \" , namely the emergence , in the infinite volume limit , of an interval at the bottom of the spectrum of the hamiltonian , on which the corresponding spectral measure vanishes .    since the critical density may be seen as an integral , w.r.t .",
    "this measure , of a function with a divergence at the bottom of the spectrum , the presence of hidden spectrum immediately implies the finiteness of the critical density , even at low dimensions .",
    "indeed , one of the main observations of this paper concerns the decoupling , in our setting , of a series of features which equivalently characterize bec above the critical density for homogeneous graphs with free hamiltonian .    for periodic graphs indeed , the appearance of bec",
    "is determined by the finiteness of the critical density . if this happens , in order to obtain a thermodynamical state with non - trivial condensate , one should choose the chemical potential @xmath1 for the cut - off region @xmath2 so to keep the density constant and above the critical density .    for inhomogeneous graphs with pure hopping hamiltonian",
    "the finiteness of the critical density is neither necessary nor sufficient for the existence of a thermodynamic limit with bec .",
    "comb graphs for example have finite critical density also at low dimensions , however this does not imply the existence of locally normal thermodynamical states exhibiting bec .",
    "this is because such finiteness is due to the presence of hidden spectrum , instead of to the integrability of the divergence at the bottom of the spectrum .    on the other hand",
    ", one can prove ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that for the graph @xmath3 a thermodynamical state with bec exists , despite of the infinite critical density .    moreover , higher - dimensional combs admit bec , but the threshold dimension is not given by the growth of the volume , but by the growth of the perron - frobenius vector .",
    "such threshold dimension also plays a rle in the choice of the sequence @xmath4 of the finite volume chemical potentials which gives rise to locally normal states with bec .    apparently ,",
    "the notion which is still capable of determining the existence of bec is that of transience of the hamiltonian operator .",
    "the class of graphs that we analyze in the paper consists of zero density perturbations of @xmath5periodic graphs with finite quotients , @xmath5 being a discrete amenable group .",
    "we equip any such graph @xmath6 with a c@xmath7-algebra of operators on @xmath0 , containing in particular @xmath5invariant operators with finite propagation , and endow the algebra with a finite trace @xmath8 .",
    "this trace , composed with the spectral projections of the hamiltonian , produces the spectral measure at the infinite volume limit .",
    "therefore the presence of hidden spectrum may be seen as a consequence of the non faithfulness of the gns representation associated with the trace @xmath8 .",
    "a relevant notion in this paper is that of generalized perron ",
    "frobenius eigenvector , namely a ( not necessarily @xmath9 ) vector with positive entries on @xmath10 which is an eigenvector of the adjacency operator @xmath11 , with eigenvalue @xmath12 . for the pure hopping hamiltonian indeed",
    ", this vector describes the minimal energy , hence the bose ",
    "einstein condensate .",
    "another main technical issue studied in this paper is how small perturbations of periodic graphs modify the behavior under the thermodynamical limit . as a main tool ,",
    "we prove what we call the secular equation , which relates the resolvent of the adjacency operator of a perturbed graph with that of the unperturbed one .",
    "as a first byproduct we may prove the existence of hidden spectrum , and hence of finite critical density , for a large class of examples . finally , we can completely analyze the thermodynamical limit for the comb graph @xmath13 , showing that locally normal kms states at the critical density may appear exactly when @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , we show that for the low dimensional combs , it is impossible to exhibit infinite volume states describing a portion of bose  einstein condensate having a correct local meaning .",
    "this happens since the adjacency matrix is recurrent , and we can exhibit a unique kms state for a given inverse temperature @xmath15 , which is non normal w.r.t . the fock state .",
    "in addition , the thermodynamic limit with constant density does not describe bose ",
    "einstein condensate even in the transient case , i.e. for the comb graphs @xmath16 , @xmath14 .",
    "such a condensate exists only at the critical density , and is obtained with a carefully chosen asymptotics of the chemical potentials for the finite volume approximations .    to end the present introduction",
    ", we recall that the comb graphs considered here are a particular case of the graphs obtained via the comb product , and that , as studied in @xcite and references therein , there is a correspondence between the notion of classical , resp .",
