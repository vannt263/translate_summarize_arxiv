    "processes involving energetic light particles play an important role in particle physics .",
    "examples are jet production in @xmath5 annihilation , @xmath2-meson decays into light particles , and many other hard qcd processes . the theoretical description of such processes is often complicated by the presence of soft and collinear singularities , which invalidate the application of the ( local ) operator product expansion . in some cases factorization theorems",
    "have been established , which provide a simplified description of the relevant observables at leading order in the limit @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the characteristic energy of the process , and @xmath8 is the scale of non - perturbative hadronic physics",
    ". formal proofs of these factorization theorems are difficult and typically rely on a diagrammatic analysis of different momentum regions giving rise to leading - order contributions to the amplitude",
    ". it would be desirable to facilitate these proofs and make them more transparent .",
    "even more challenging is to develop a systematic framework for the parameterization and classification of power corrections for observables that do not admit an expansion in local operators .    the proposal of an effective field theory for collinear and soft particles by bauer et al .",
    "@xcite is an important step toward achieving this goal .",
    "this `` soft - collinear effective theory '' ( scet ) lets us discuss factorization theorems and power corrections in terms of fields and operators rather than momentum regions of feynman diagrams . while power counting in the effective theory is non - trivial due to the fact that the relevant operators are non - local , there is nevertheless hope for a controlled expansion of amplitudes in terms of hadronic matrix elements of scet operators ( multiplied by perturbative wilson coefficient functions ) , whose structure is constrained by gauge invariance and lorentz symmetry .",
    "scet has been applied to prove factorization and resum sudakov logarithms for the endpoint region of the photon energy spectrum in @xmath9 decays @xcite , and to prove qcd factorization as established in @xcite for the weak decays @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "applications to hard processes outside @xmath2 physics , such as deep - inelastic scattering , drell  yan production , and deeply virtual compton scattering , have been considered in @xcite .",
    "recently , the formulation of scet has been extended beyond leading power @xcite .",
    "these analyses constitute a significant first step toward a theory of power corrections that is more general than a local operator product expansion .    in this work we present an extension of the previous formulation of scet , which is necessary for the discussion of exclusive @xmath2 decays into light particles , such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and heavy - to - light form factors at large recoil .",
    "( the `` soft contribution '' to heavy - to - light form factors has been discussed previously in the context of scet , both at leading order @xcite and beyond @xcite .",
    "however , no systematic treatment of all leading - power contributions has been presented so far . ) for all these cases qcd factorization theorems have been proposed @xcite , but have not yet been proved beyond next - to - leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , factorization theorems for exclusive @xmath2-meson decays into light particles are more complicated than those for the decays into a heavy - light final state such as @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to a form - factor term , a hard - scattering contribution appears at leading power , which results from hard gluon exchange with the spectator quark in the @xmath2 meson @xcite .",
    "this contribution involves a convolution of a hard - scattering kernel with light - cone distribution amplitudes for the final - state hadrons and the initial @xmath2 meson .",
    "a proof of factorization for such spectator contributions has not been attempted so far .",
    "the formulation of scet developed here provides for the first time the framework for a systematic discussion of factorization in all of these cases and others @xcite .",
    "whereas for highly energetic light mesons the relevance of light - cone distribution amplitudes to the description of exclusive processes is familiar from many applications of perturbative qcd , relatively little is known about the light - cone structure of heavy hadrons . at first sight ,",
    "even the appearance of light - cone distributions for the @xmath2 meson seems surprising , because ( in the @xmath2-meson rest frame ) all characteristic momentum scales are soft , of order @xmath13 . unlike for a fast light meson , there is thus no hierarchy between the different components of the momenta of the @xmath2-meson constituents .",
    "however , the kinematics of heavy - to - light decay processes ensures that ( in some cases ) only the projection of the soft spectator momentum along some light - like direction enters the decay amplitudes at leading power in @xmath0 .",
    "because of the softness of the relevant momentum scales the notion of twist is not appropriate for the characterization of @xmath2-meson light - cone distribution amplitudes , which instead should be categorized according to their canonical dimension .",
    "some distinctive features between @xmath2-meson and light - meson distribution amplitudes have already been noted in the literature . whereas there exists a single leading - twist distribution amplitude for light pseudoscalar and vector mesons , two independent @xmath2-meson",
    "distribution amplitudes appear at leading order in the heavy - quark expansion @xcite . in the case of light mesons , the equations of motion imply relations between higher - twist distribution amplitudes and connect them with amplitudes of lower twist ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for heavy mesons instead",
    ", the equations of motion relate the leading - order two - particle amplitudes to certain three - particle amplitudes ( corresponding to quark  antiquark  gluon fock components ) of higher dimension @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic softness of the @xmath2-meson internal dynamics complicates the understanding of factorization properties of decay amplitudes .",
    "a new element is the appearance of an intermediate scale of order @xmath14 , which arises from the scalar product of a soft spectator momentum @xmath15 with a collinear momentum @xmath16 . while this scale is perturbative ( since formally @xmath17 ) and thus should be integrated out from the low - energy effective theory , it nevertheless depends on the @xmath2-meson dynamics and is not simply fixed by kinematics",
    "this is different from previous applications of heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) and scet , where the large scales were fixed in terms of the @xmath18-quark mass and the large energy @xmath19 carried by collinear fields .",
    "the appearance of an intermediate scale naturally leads to non - local operators integrated along light - like directions , whose matrix elements define the @xmath2-meson distribution amplitudes .",
    "the presence of three widely separated scales ( @xmath20 ) also complicates the perturbative structure of decay amplitudes .",
    "sudakov double logarithms appear at every order in perturbation theory and must be resummed .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : scet ] we present the construction of the scet relevant to exclusive @xmath2 decays , introduce the relevant fields , discuss their power counting and gauge transformations , and derive the effective lagrangian .",
    "interactions between soft and collinear fields are studied in section  [ sec : scints ] , and are shown to be absent at leading order . in section  [ sec : softcol ] we discuss in detail the matching of current operators containing a soft light quark and a collinear quark onto operators in the effective theory .",
    "several new features appear in this calculation , such as the emergence of the intermediate scale , large non - localities of operators on a scale @xmath1 , and unsuppressed couplings between soft quarks and transverse collinear gluons . in section  [ sec : rpi ] we show how reparameterization invariance can be used to constrain the functional dependence of short - distance coefficient functions on the separation between the component fields of non - local operators .",
    "the renormalization of such operators and the related resummation of sudakov logarithms are briefly discussed .",
    "the matching of local four - quark operators onto operators in the scet is studied in section  [ sec:4qops ] .",
    "this application is of relevance to qcd factorization theorems for many exclusive @xmath2 decays .",
    "a surprising result is that , generically , higher - twist three - particle distribution amplitudes of a light final - state meson can contribute to the decay amplitude at leading power . in section",
    "[ sec : examples ] we illustrate the implications of these findings for the factorization properties of @xmath2-meson decay amplitudes in some toy models .",
    "we present two examples , one where a standard qcd factorization formula can be established at leading power , and one where the factorization formula must be generalized due to non - trivial interactions of the soft spectator quark with collinear gluons .",
    "the results derived in this work suggest a new formulation of the scet , in which operators are composed out of gauge - invariant building blocks , replacing the original quark and gluon fields .",
    "this formalism is developed in section  [ sec : pretty ] .",
    "in the new formulation operators are automatically gauge invariant and their structure is constrained only by lorentz invariance .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : formfactor ] we explain how our power - counting scheme can be applied to describe the soft overlap contribution to heavy - to - light form factors , which in previous work was analyzed using a different formulation of the scet @xcite .",
    "a summary of our findings is given in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we start by discussing in detail the properties of the fields present in the low - energy theory , using the coordinate - space formulation developed by beneke et al .",
    "@xcite ( and avoiding the hybrid momentum  position space representation and label - operator formalism employed in earlier papers on scet ) .",
    "part of this discussion is a repetition of similar results presented in that paper and earlier work ( see , in particular , the review @xcite ) , but this will be necessary in order to set up our notations in a self - contained way . since our power counting and choice of degrees of freedom is different from the one employed in @xcite , our results for the effective lagrangian and external operators in scet will be different from those already discussed in that work .",
    "our focus in this paper is on exclusive @xmath2-meson decays into final states containing light , energetic particles .",
    "the invariant masses of the final - state hadrons are of order @xmath13 , and the momenta of their constituents are predominantly collinear .",
    "it is often convenient to decompose momenta and gauge fields in the light - cone basis constructed with the help of two light - like vectors @xmath21 which obey @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "an arbitrary 4-vector can be expanded as @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the components @xmath27 of a collinear momentum scale like @xmath28 , where @xmath19 is the large energy release in the process , and @xmath29 is the expansion parameter of the scet .",
    "the initial @xmath2 meson , on the other hand , consists of soft partons with momenta scaling like @xmath30 .",
    "( this assumes that we work in the @xmath2-meson rest frame and subtract the static piece @xmath31 from the @xmath18-quark momentum . )",
    "note that in kinematical situations different from the ones considered here the scaling relations of soft and collinear momenta ( and of the corresponding scet fields ) can be different .",
    "for instance , when the photon energy in inclusive @xmath9 decays is near the kinematic endpoint , the hadronic final state @xmath32 has an invariant mass of order @xmath33 , which is much larger than @xmath13 .",
    "it is then appropriate to introduce an expansion parameter @xmath34 @xcite .    in the kinematical situation of relevance to our discussion ,",
    "the fields appearing in the low - energy effective theory are either soft or collinear . as in hqet",
    ", we introduce a soft heavy - quark field @xmath35 defined in terms of the qcd field @xmath18 by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath2-meson velocity .",
    "the fourier modes of the field @xmath35 carry the soft residual momentum @xmath38 .",
    "the two components of the spinor @xmath18 projected out in the definition of @xmath35 are integrated out in the construction of the hqet . the soft light - quark field @xmath39 and soft gluon fields @xmath40 are simply given by the corresponding qcd fields , restricted to the subspace of soft fourier modes .",
    "using the identity @xmath23 , the dirac field @xmath41 of a collinear quark can be decomposed into two 2-component spinors @xmath42 the components of @xmath43 are suppressed with respect to those of @xmath44 by a factor @xmath29 and are integrated out in the construction of the scet .",
    "the collinear gluon fields @xmath45 are defined as in qcd , restricted however to the subspace of fourier modes with collinear momenta .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will from now on drop the label @xmath37 on heavy - quark fields , and the label @xmath46 on collinear quark and gluon fields .",
    "it is understood that collinear fields always have their large momentum component in the @xmath46-direction , with @xmath47 .    from the scaling behavior of the various two - point functions of two soft or two collinear fields",
    "one can derive the scaling properties of these fields with the expansion parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the strategy here is to define the kinetic terms in the action to have scaling @xmath49 , so that factors of @xmath48 only appear in vertices of the effective theory .",
    "it follows that the soft fields scale like @xmath50 and @xmath51 , whereas the collinear fields scale like @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "note that the covariant derivatives @xmath55 and @xmath56 have homogeneous scaling laws when acting on soft or collinear fields , respectively .    previous discussions of scet have often introduced ultrasoft modes with momentum scaling @xmath57 , because these modes can be coupled to collinear particles without taking them far off their mass shell . in cases where the expansion parameter scales like @xmath34 ultrasoft fields simply correspond to what we call soft modes in the present paper . in our case ,",
    "where @xmath29 , there is no need to introduce ultrasoft modes as degrees of freedom in the effective theory , because there are no external ultrasoft particles present .",
    "such modes would correspond to color fields extending over large distance scales of order @xmath58 , which do not appear in qcd because of confinement .",
    "operators in the effective theory must be invariant under residual gauge transformations in the collinear and soft sectors ( i.e. , transformations that leave the scaling properties of the fields unaltered ) . under a collinear gauge transformation @xmath59 the collinear fields transform according to @xmath60 and @xmath61 , whereas soft fields remain invariant .",
    "likewise , under a soft gauge transformation @xmath62 we have @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , while collinear fields remain invariant .",
    "gauge invariance of operators built out of these fields can be restored by the introduction of collinear and soft wilson lines defined as @xmath66 which can be visualized as color strings attaching to a quark field at point @xmath67 and extending to infinity .",
    "( it does not matter whether the integrals in these expressions run from @xmath68 to 0 or from 0 to @xmath69 . )",
    "the path - ordering symbol `` @xmath70 '' is defined such that the gluon fields are ordered from left to right in order of decreasing @xmath71 or @xmath72 values .",
    "we also need the conjugate operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which are given by analogous expressions with @xmath75 replaced by @xmath76 , and with the opposite ordering of the fields . under a collinear gauge transformation @xmath77 , whereas @xmath78 remains invariant . similarly , under a soft gauge transformation @xmath79 , whereas @xmath80 remains invariant .",
    "if , without loss of generality , we agree that the fields do not transform at infinity , then it follows that @xmath81 is gauge invariant , as are @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the wilson lines satisfy several important properties , the most useful ones being @xmath84 and corresponding relations for @xmath85 . also note that @xmath86 and @xmath87 by definition .",
    "a particularly important object in our discussion below is the combination @xmath88 , which is invariant under both collinear and soft gauge transformations . by definition @xmath89 , but the other components of @xmath90 are non - zero . in the light - cone",
    "gauge @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 and hence @xmath93 . in an arbitrary gauge",
    ", we find the useful representation @xmath94(x )     = \\int_{-\\infty}^0\\!dw\\,\\bar n_\\alpha\\,\\big [ w^\\dagger      g g_c^{\\alpha\\mu}\\,w \\big](x+w\\bar n ) \\,,\\ ] ] which makes explicit that @xmath90 is a pure color octet , @xmath95 .",
    "( here and below color indices on gluon fields will appear as superscripts , while subscripts `` @xmath96 '' and `` @xmath71 '' always refer to `` collinear '' or `` soft '' , respectively . ) to derive this formula one notes that both sides are gauge invariant , and that the result is obviously correct in the light - cone gauge",
    ". the reader should think of the object @xmath97 as an insertion of a collinear gluon field , remembering however that this quantity is gauge invariant .",
    "the effective lagrangian for soft and collinear fields can be derived by systematically integrating out the hard modes ( including the small - component fields for heavy and collinear quarks ) from the qcd lagrangian , and expanding the result in powers of @xmath48 .",
    "it is convenient to split up the answer into several terms , @xmath98 the effective lagrangian for heavy quarks is the familiar hqet lagrangian @xcite @xmath99 + o(1/m_b^2 ) \\,.\\ ] ] let us note parenthetically that interactions between heavy quarks and soft gluons are , strictly speaking , not allowed in the low - energy theory , since they put the heavy quark off - shell by an amount @xmath100 .",
    "these interactions can be integrated out , leading to the replacement @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is a wilson line defined in analogy with ( [ wsdef ] ) but with @xmath46 replaced by the @xmath2-meson velocity @xmath37 .",
    "the field @xmath103 is sterile in the sense that it does not couple to soft or collinear gluons .",
    "the heavy - quark lagrangian is then simply @xmath104 . in all expressions for operators containing heavy - quark fields the replacement @xmath101",
    "must be made as well .",
    "since this has no effect on the feynman rule for the soft - gluon couplings , rather than introducing the new string operator @xmath102 we will follow the usual convention of using the hqet field @xmath105 with its soft interactions as given by ( [ hqet ] ) .    the lagrangian for a soft massless quark is the usual dirac lagrangian ( it would be straightforward to include a small mass term ) @xmath106 the effective lagrangian for collinear quarks , which is obtained by integrating out the small - component field @xmath107 , has a more interesting structure @xcite . with our notations it reads @xmath108(x)\\ ,      \\frac{\\nbslash}{2}\\,\\big [ w^\\dagger i\\dslash_{c\\perp}\\,\\xi      \\big](x+s\\bar n ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xcite it has been argued that the choice of the @xmath109 prescription is arbitrary and not dictated by the qcd lagrangian .",
    "a regularization of the inverse differential operator is necessary but bears no physical implications .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath110 sums up an infinite number of leading - order couplings between collinear quarks and ( scalar or longitudinal ) gluons . in the absence of sources",
    "the collinear lagrangian is related to the qcd lagrangian by a lorentz boost , and so the two must be equivalent . as a result ,",
    "the collinear lagrangian is exact to all orders in @xmath48 , and it is not renormalized @xcite .",
    "finally , the pure - glue lagrangian @xmath111 in ( [ leff ] ) takes the same form as in qcd , including gauge - fixing and ghost terms .",
    "however , it is understood that no term in this lagrangian couples soft to collinear gluon fields . those couplings ,",
    "if present , would be part of @xmath112 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , there are no vertices in the effective theory that connect the two heavy - quark fields to any number of collinear fields , because such interactions are kinematically forbidden at tree level . by the coleman ",
    "norton theorem @xcite they can therefore not lead to on - shell singularities in any qcd diagram , and hence there is no need to include such interactions as part of the effective lagrangian .",
    "however , the same argument does not apply to the interactions between collinear particles and soft light fields .",
    "we will now investigate these interactions in more detail .",
    "it is kinematically allowed to couple soft fields to collinear fields only if the total soft momentum @xmath113 satisfies the condition @xmath114 , and the difference between the ingoing and outgoing collinear momenta is such that @xmath115 .",
    "these constraints imply a power counting for the measure @xmath116 in the soft - collinear action @xmath117 that is different from that for the interactions of soft or collinear fields among themselves .",
    "usually the measure @xmath118 is counted as @xmath119 , since it eliminates either a collinear or a soft momentum , with @xmath120 . as a result , the operators appearing at leading order in the lagrangians @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 scale like @xmath123 . on the other hand ,",
    "when a term in the soft - collinear lagrangian @xmath112 is integrated over @xmath116 , this produces @xmath124-functions @xmath125 in each term we must eliminate one of the largest momentum components , so that the remaining momenta are unconstrained .",
    "it follows that the first @xmath124-function eliminates an integral over a minus component of a collinear momentum , the second @xmath124-function eliminates an integral over a plus component of a soft momentum , and the last @xmath124-function eliminates two components of a transverse momentum .",
    "it is important that the second @xmath124-function must not be used to eliminate a plus component of a collinear momentum such as @xmath126 , since for generic soft momenta the combination @xmath127 would not be of order @xmath128 .",
    "the eliminated momenta combined scale like @xmath129 , and hence we must count the measure in the soft - collinear action as @xmath130 .",
    "it follows that , at leading order in @xmath48 , only operators scaling like @xmath131 can appear in the soft - collinear interaction lagrangian .",
    "= 11.0 cm    we start by discussing soft - collinear interactions induced by the exchange of off - shell modes with momentum scaling like @xmath132 , which are generically produced when soft fields are coupled to collinear ones . in order to find the exact form of the corresponding terms in the lagrangian one would have to integrate out the off - shell modes in the path integral .",
    "this is a difficult problem , whose solution we leave for future work . in the following",
    "we choose a `` pedestrian '' approach and match the resulting interaction terms involving two soft and two collinear fields perturbatively .",
    "we find that at leading order in @xmath48 there are interactions between two soft quarks and two collinear gluons , two collinear quarks and two soft gluons , and two soft and two collinear gluons . in the first two cases",
    "an off - shell quark propagator is integrated out , while in the latter case an off - shell gluon propagator occurs .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : softcol ] , in this case one must also include the local four - gluon vertex present in full qcd . we find that the resulting soft - collinear interactions connecting two collinear and two soft partons are obtained from the lagrangian @xmath133 \\nonumber\\\\     & & \\hspace{1.835cm}\\mbox{}+ a_{c-}^a\\,\\frac{1}{i\\partial_-}\\,a_{c-}^b      \\big [ a_{s+}^m\\,i\\partial_-\\,a_{s+}^n      - a_{s\\perp\\mu}^m\\,i\\partial_+\\,a_{s\\perp}^{\\mu , n }      + 2a_{s\\perp\\mu}^m\\,i\\partial_\\perp^\\mu\\,a_{s+}^n \\big ] \\nonumber\\\\     & & \\hspace{1.835cm}\\mbox{}- \\frac12\\,i\\partial_{\\perp\\mu } \\big (      a_{s+}^m\\,\\frac{1}{i\\partial_+}\\,a_{s+}^n \\big)\\ ,      i\\partial_\\perp^\\mu \\big ( a_{c-}^a\\,\\frac{1}{i\\partial_-}\\,a_{c-}^b      \\big ) \\bigg\\ } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the short - hand notation @xmath134 and @xmath135 etc .  for brevity .",
    "note that this lagrangian is symmetric under the exchange of soft and collinear fields combined with @xmath136 . that this is a symmetry of the soft - collinear interaction lagrangian follows from the fact that a longitudinal lorentz boost can be used to turn collinear fields into soft ones and vice versa .",
    "= 3.5 cm    it is also possible to couple a single soft field to two or more collinear fields . in that case",
    "the @xmath124-functions in ( [ delta ] ) enforce that the momentum of the soft field must scale like @xmath137 .",
    "the smallness of the plus component of this momentum implies a phase - space suppression , which however is already taken into account by assigning scaling @xmath130 rather than @xmath119 to the measure @xmath116 in the action .",
    "note that the soft parton is still off - shell by an amount of order @xmath138 , as is any other soft mode .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : messenger ] , the soft field produced in such an interaction can interact with other soft particles , thereby acting as a messenger between the soft and collinear sectors of scet .",
    "let us add that , alternatively , we could study couplings of a single collinear field to two or more soft fields . in that case the @xmath124-functions in ( [ delta ] ) enforce that the momentum of the collinear field must scale like @xmath137 , and the phase - space suppression is now reflected in the smallness of the minus component of this momentum . in order to avoid double counting , let us agree that collinear fields always have a large momentum component , so a field with momentum scaling like @xmath137 is considered part of a soft mode , not a collinear one .",
    "this convention breaks the `` soft - collinear symmetry '' mentioned at the end of the last paragraph .",
    "it is nevertheless reasonable , since the @xmath2 meson defines a particular lorentz frame , in which it is natural to consider a @xmath139 mode as part of a soft mode .",
    "the asymmetry introduced by this choice could be avoided by introducing separate `` soft - collinear '' fields for the @xmath139 modes and studying their interactions with soft and collinear particles .",
    "but since we will show that these modes are irrelevant at leading order , this would only lead to an unnecessary proliferation of notation .",
    "there are three elementary vertices in qcd which are of order @xmath131 and couple a soft field to collinear fields : the coupling of a soft gluon to two collinear quarks , the coupling of a soft gluon to two collinear gluons , and the coupling of a soft gluon to three collinear gluons .",
    "these interactions follow from the lagrangian @xmath140    an important observation following from the calculations presented above is that at leading order in @xmath48 the soft - collinear interactions involve at least one @xmath141 or @xmath142 gluon field .",
    "we expect this feature to pertain also to interactions involving more than four partons .",
    "these interaction terms are `` unphysical '' in the sense that they involve scalar or longitudinal gluon polarizations and can be made to vanish by choosing the light - cone gauge conditions @xmath143 and @xmath91 .",
    "we will argue in section  [ sec : pretty ] that any gauge - invariant operator in scet can be constructed out of gauge - invariant building blocks , which are non - zero in light - cone gauge .",
    "this suggests that the interactions in ( [ 2gl ] ) and ( [ 1gl ] ) can be removed by field redefinitions ( i.e. , they vanish by the equations of motion ) .",
    "let us demonstrate this explicitly for the terms involving quark fields .",
    "consider the first term in ( [ 2gl ] ) , which couples two collinear gluons to two soft quarks .",
    "since we have derived this term by matching an amplitude with two external gluons , we are free to replace @xmath144 in the denominator by a covariant derivative .",
    "next we use the identity @xmath145 which follows from ( [ neat ] ) .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side is suppressed with respect to the first one by a power of @xmath48 and can be neglected . repeated application of this identity ( and its dirac conjugate ) yields , to leading order in @xmath48 , @xmath146 this vanishes by momentum conservation ( enforced by the integration over @xmath116 in the action ) , since with our convention for collinear fields it is impossible to couple a single collinear particle to soft fields .",
    "a derivation analogous to ( [ interm ] ) , but with all soft and collinear fields interchanged , can be used to show that the terms in ( [ 2gl ] ) and ( [ 1gl ] ) coupling two collinear quarks to one or two soft gluons vanishes at leading order : @xmath147 similar arguments should apply for the pure - glue interactions . we conclude that the soft - collinear lagrangian in ( [ leff ] ) vanishes to leading order , @xmath148 , and that the @xmath139 messenger modes of the type shown in figure  [ fig : messenger ] are irrelevant to leading power in @xmath48 .",
    "these findings agree with arguments based on soft - collinear gauge invariance presented in @xcite , where however the special kinematics of soft - collinear interactions and the potential relevance of messenger modes were not addressed .",
    "the observation that soft - collinear interactions are absent at leading power in the scet lagrangian will be of crucial importance to the discussion of factorization in sections  [ sec:4qops ] and  [ sec : examples ] .",

    "the momentum - space wilson coefficients corresponding to the coefficients @xmath274 and @xmath275 in ( [ 4qfinal ] ) are , in general , complicated functions of the scales @xmath276 , @xmath277 , @xmath245 , and @xmath244 ( where @xmath19 ) , and of dimensionless variables @xmath236 and @xmath37 measuring the longitudinal momentum fractions of the collinear quark and gluon ( in the case of the operators @xmath278 ) inside the light final - state meson . it is impossible to eliminate all large ratios of these scales by a choice of the renormalization point @xmath279 .",
    "in such a case the resummation of large logarithms of the type @xmath280 can be achieved by performing the matching onto the low - energy effective theory in two steps .",
    "first one integrates out hard modes as well as the couplings of collinear gluons to the heavy quark .",
    "this yields ( non - local ) operators in an intermediate effective theory which still contains @xmath194 modes as dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "the wilson coefficients arising in this step are functions of @xmath276 , @xmath277 and @xmath244 ( as well as @xmath236 ) .",
    "they can be calculated perturbatively at a scale @xmath281 and evolved down to a scale @xmath282 using the renormalization group . in the second step the off - shell @xmath194 modes are integrated out , yielding the scet as constructed in this work .",
    "this gives rise to wilson coefficients that depend on the scales @xmath245 and @xmath244 ( as well as @xmath236 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "solving the renormalization - group equations in scet these coefficients can then be evolved down to scales @xmath283 , at which the operators in scet are renormalized .",
    "concrete examples of such a two - step matching procedure will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we stress that , while the resummation of large logarithms arising from the evolution between the two hard scales @xmath276 and @xmath14 is necessary to obtain reliable perturbative predictions for the wilson coefficient functions , it is not required for the discussion of the factorization properties of matrix elements in the low - energy effective theory .",
    "the presence of non - trivial interactions between the soft spectator quark and collinear gluons complicates the understanding of the factorization properties of @xmath2-meson decay amplitudes .",
    "we will now illustrate this fact with the help of some toy examples .",
    "realistic examples such as @xmath12 or @xmath11 are more complicated and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "consider the effective weak hamiltonian @xmath284 mediating the exclusive decay @xmath285 , where the color - singlet field @xmath286 can be a scalar , vector , or any other field , depending on the quantum numbers of the dirac matrices @xmath251 . this interaction is simpler than in the standard model since it is local , but otherwise it shares many similarities with terms that occur in the effective weak hamiltonian of the standard model .",
    "based on the fact that the outgoing kaon contains a highly energetic , collinear @xmath287 pair and so decouples from soft gluons ( `` color transparency '' ) , one would expect , following @xcite , that at leading power in @xmath0 the decay amplitude should obey the qcd factorization formula @xmath288 where @xmath289 and @xmath290 are leading - order light - cone distribution amplitudes defined , e.g. , in @xcite , and @xmath291 is the hard - scattering kernel , which in the context of the scet would be identified with a wilson coefficient function .",
    "it is evident from our discussion in the previous section that for the simple result ( [ ff ] ) to be correct the matrix elements of the operators @xmath278 would have to vanish .",
    "otherwise , the factorization formula would have to be generalized to include a term involving higher - twist distribution amplitudes of the kaon .",
    "matrix elements of the operators @xmath278 in ( [ qrdef ] ) are zero if the product @xmath292 of dirac matrices vanishes , or if the @xmath2-meson matrix element of the structure @xmath293 vanishes by rotational invariance in the transverse plane .",
    "we believe that in many cases of phenomenological interest this is indeed what happens .",
    "consider , as an example , the decay @xmath294 , where @xmath295 is a fictitious light scalar .",
    "in this case the lorentz indices of @xmath296 must always be contracted with those of @xmath297 .",
    "let us , for simplicity , work at tree level , so that the dirac structures @xmath298 appearing in the scet operators are the same as those in the original operators . between the collinear quark spinors @xmath299 and @xmath300 the dirac basis matrices @xmath301\\}$ ]",
    "are projected to @xmath302 .",
    "it follows that after contraction of lorentz indices the product @xmath298 can only take the forms @xmath303 or @xmath304\\otimes[\\nslash,\\gamma_{\\perp\\nu}]$ ] .",
    "this guarantees that @xmath305 for all possible dirac structures , and hence the operators @xmath278 vanish .",
    "we conclude that for this particular process the factorization formula ( [ ff ] ) would hold , at least at tree level .",
    "the mechanism just described does not appear to be universal , however .",
    "consider , as a counterexample , the case where @xmath306 is the electromagnetic field , and where the dirac matrices in ( [ heff ] ) are chosen to be @xmath307 for the color singlet - singlet term and @xmath308 for the octet - octet term .",
    "this effective hamiltonian mediates the radiative decay @xmath309 ( but not in the standard model ) . at tree level ,",
    "the corresponding operators @xmath310 and @xmath278 in scet have dirac structures @xmath311 times @xmath312 and @xmath313 times @xmath312 , respectively .",
    "after projection onto the @xmath2 meson , the resulting lorentz structures in the two cases are @xmath314 where @xmath315 is the transverse polarization vector of the @xmath316 meson , and we have used the well - known scaling relations for current matrix elements of heavy and light mesons @xcite .",
    "it is evident that for this example both operators contribute at the same order in power counting , and hence the simple qcd factorization formula in ( [ ff ] ) must be generalized to include a term involving twist-3 light - cone distribution amplitudes of the kaon .",
    "it follows that the question of factorization for the hard - spectator term in a qcd factorization formula is far from trivial . whether a simple qcd factorization formula holds , or whether it must be generalized to include higher - twist distribution amplitudes , requires a case by case study .",
    "it is conceivable that in many cases of phenomenological importance it will be possible to exclude the presence of the operators @xmath278 based on some symmetry , such as rotational invariance in the transverse plane or reparameterization invariance .",
    "it remains to find a general argument supporting this assertion .",
    "the careful reader will have noticed that , as a result of gauge invariance , the external current and four - quark operators in scet discussed in the previous sections always contain products of the wilson lines @xmath156 and @xmath85 with soft or collinear quark fields , respectively .",
    "this suggests introducing new fields @xmath317 which are manifestly gauge invariant and have the same scaling relations in @xmath48 as the original fields . in the case where one chooses the light - cone gauge conditions @xmath143 and @xmath91 the new fields agree with the original ones . in terms of the new fields , the four - quark operators in ( [ qrdef ] )",
    "take the simple form @xmath318 and similar simplified expressions hold for the current operators in ( [ hlmatch ] ) , ( [ llmatch1 ] ) , and ( [ llmatch2 ] ) .    while the definition of these new fields seems merely a matter of convenience of notation , we will now argue that , in fact , any operator in scet can be built from a small set of gauge - invariant fields .",
    "once these fields are known , gauge invariance of operators containing them is guaranteed , and the only remaining rules for the construction of scet operators are lorentz and reparameterization invariance . therefore , the formalism we will introduce in this section will simplify the construction of scet operators , which is important , in particular , for going beyond the leading order in @xmath48 .",
    "the qcd lagrangian contains , besides quark ( and ghost ) fields , the gauge - covariant derivative . in scet",
    "we have distinguished between the collinear and soft covariant derivatives @xmath319 and @xmath320 .",
    "we can construct gauge - invariant objects from these quantities by using the field @xmath90 introduced in ( [ adef ] ) and a corresponding object defined in the soft sector : @xmath321(x )     = \\int_{-\\infty}^0\\!dw\\,n_\\alpha\\,\\big [ s^\\dagger g g_s^{\\alpha\\mu }     s \\big](x+wn ) \\,.\\ ] ] the gauge - invariant fields @xmath90 and @xmath322 obey the constraints @xmath89 and @xmath323 in any gauge .",
    "( recall that in the light - cone gauge these fields coincide with the corresponding gluon fields @xmath324 and @xmath325 . )",
    "it follows that the scaling relations of the new fields are @xmath326 and @xmath327 .",
    "we finally define new , gauge - invariant objects @xmath328    with the help of these definitions , the different parts of the leading - order scet lagrangian can be rewritten in the form @xmath329 the appearance of an ordinary derivative in the expression for @xmath110 is not in conflict with gauge invariance , since all the component fields are gauge invariant by themselves .",
    "finally , also the pure - glue lagrangians for soft and collinear fields take a simple form .",
    "since we can replace @xmath330 by @xmath331 $ ] and @xmath332 by @xmath333 $ ] in the lagrangian ( using the cyclicity of the color trace ) , the resulting pure - glue lagrangians are simply obtained by replacing all gluon fields in the usual qcd lagrangian with the new fields @xmath97 and @xmath334 .",
    "let us briefly summarize the properties of the gauge - invariant building blocks under the three types of reparameterizations discussed in section  [ sec : rpi ] .",
    "we find that the redefined quark fields as well as the soft gluon field @xmath322 are invariant up to higher - order terms in @xmath48 .",
    "however , the collinear gluon field has non - trivial transformations at leading order . under a type  i transformation",
    "@xmath335 while @xmath336 remains invariant . under a type  ii transformation @xmath337 while @xmath338 remains invariant .",
    "the corresponding transformation properties of the `` collinear derivative '' are @xmath339 and @xmath340 ( type  i ) , and @xmath341 while @xmath342 remains invariant ( type  ii ) .",
    "invariance under type  iii reparameterizations requires that every occurrence of a vector @xmath46 in the numerator must be accompanied by that of a vector @xmath217 , or by a factor of @xmath343 in the denominator ( and vice versa ) . from these rules it follows ,",
    "e.g. , that the sum of the two terms in the collinear lagrangian @xmath110 in ( [ lrewrite ] ) is reparameterization invariant , but not the two operators separately .",
    "after the introduction of the new fields the expression for any operator in scet looks like an expression in the light - cone gauge ; however , we have not imposed light - cone gauge but rather redefined the fields by a unitary transformation . in the new formulation",
    "the wilson lines have disappeared , and all fields in the theory scale like at least one power of @xmath48 ( the large collinear field @xmath344 has been removed ) . finally , gauge invariance is no longer a constraint on the construction of operators in the effective theory .",
    "our goal in this paper was to find a formulation of scet suitable for the systematic study of the factorization properties and power corrections for any exclusive @xmath2-meson decay into light particles .",
    "it is important , then , to have a theory that describes the form - factor term and the hard - scattering term in a factorization formula in terms of the same fields and scaling rules .",
    "however , previous work on the soft component of exclusive heavy - to - light form factors has been based on the scaling assumption @xmath34 @xcite , which is different from our hypothesis . in this case",
    "soft fields carrying momenta of order @xmath13 scale like @xmath345 and are thus called `` ultrasoft '' . the main difference with our approach",
    "is that the `` collinear modes '' in this formulation have momenta scaling like @xmath346 .",
    "the resulting effective theory thus appears to be different from the one constructed here .",
    "the challenge is to understand the soft contribution to heavy - to - light form factors , in which the @xmath2-meson spectator quark enters the light final - state meson as a soft ( or ultrasoft ) quark , so that this meson is produced in a highly asymmetric state .",
    "consider a @xmath347 transition for concreteness .",
    "the scaling @xmath34 was assumed based on the following kinematical consideration .",
    "the pion emitted in a heavy - to - light decay at large recoil carries momentum scaling like @xmath348 , and making this up by combining a soft quark with momentum @xmath349 and a collinear jet requires that this jet have invariant mass squared @xmath350 .",
    "given that for a collinear particle @xmath351 , it then follows that @xmath34 . although this argument might seem compelling , it has the unattractive feature that the external pion momentum now scales like @xmath352 , which can not be built up from the combination of a generic ultrasoft momentum @xmath353 with a generic collinear momentum @xmath28 .",
    "in other words , the plus component of the collinear jet must cancel the plus component of the soft spectator quark with a relative precision of order @xmath354 , and the transverse component of the jet has to be smaller than its generic size by a factor @xmath34 .",
    "these two constraints combined imply that the soft overlap mechanism is strongly suppressed in this picture ( which a priori is no problem , since heavy - to - light form factors are suppressed in the heavy - quark limit ) .",
    "this discussion can also be summarized in more physical terms by saying that it is unlikely that a collinear jet of particles with invariant mass of order @xmath33 will absorb a soft quark and become a light meson with mass of order @xmath13 .",
    "= 6.0 cm    here we wish to suggest a different possibility for interpreting the soft overlap contribution to heavy - to - light form factors .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : pion ] , we assume the scaling @xmath29 adopted throughout this work , so that the pion momentum scales like any other collinear momentum . in order to make a light meson out of collinear particles and soft particles , the only thing that is required is that the plus component of the total soft momentum , which generically would scale like @xmath355 , is accidentally small , of order @xmath128 .",
    "this implies a phase - space suppression of order @xmath356 .",
    "it appears more intuitive to us to assume that only a jet of particles with invariant mass of order @xmath13 can ultimately hadronize into a single light meson .",
    "it is not evident whether the choice of @xmath48 is simply a matter of convenience , or whether it corresponds to a different kinematical situation .",
    "naively , we would expect that our predictions for heavy - to - light form factors would differ from the ones obtained in @xcite .",
    "for instance , we expect that violations of heavy - quark symmetry relations between form factors start at order @xmath0 , while the power counting adopted in these papers would allow for the presence of @xmath357 corrections .",
    "the development of an effective field theory for the strong interactions of soft and collinear partons is a significant step toward the systematic study of factorization and a field - theoretical description of power corrections for observables that do not admit an operator product expansion .",
    "power counting in this soft - collinear effective theory is non - trivial due to the presence of non - local operators integrated along light - like directions , but it appears feasible to construct a controlled heavy - quark expansion of amplitudes in terms of hadronic matrix elements of effective theory operators .    in this paper",
    "we have constructed the extension of the previous formulation of soft - collinear effective theory necessary for the description of exclusive @xmath2-meson decays into light particles .",
    "qcd factorization theorems for such processes are complicated , because in addition to a form - factor term a hard - scattering contribution appears at leading power .",
    "it results from hard gluon exchange with the soft spectator quark in the @xmath2 meson .",
    "one of the main findings of our study is that interactions of collinear gluons with soft light quarks are more complicated than the corresponding interactions with heavy quarks .",
    "in particular , transverse collinear gluons have unsuppressed couplings to light soft quarks , while only longitudinal collinear gluons couple to heavy quarks at leading order in power counting .",
    "the intrinsic softness of the @xmath2-meson dynamics complicates the understanding of factorization properties of decay amplitudes .",
    "a new intermediate mass scale of order @xmath14 arises and leads to large non - localities of effective - theory operators on a scale @xmath1 , thus upsetting naive power counting .",
    "power counting can be restored , however , using reparameterization invariance , which gives control over the dependence of wilson coefficient functions on the light - like separation between the component fields of non - local operators .",
    "the version of soft - collinear effective theory relevant to the discussion of exclusive @xmath2 decays into light particles contains soft and collinear fields .",
    "we have constructed the effective lagrangian at leading order in @xmath0 , finding that it does not contain soft - collinear interaction terms .",
    "such interactions would , however , appear at subleading order .",
    "we have then discussed in detail the matching of current and four - quark operators from the full theory onto their effective - theory counterparts .",
    "this matching is complicated by the presence of non - trivial interactions between the soft spectator quark and collinear gluons .",
    "the most surprising finding of our analysis is that , generically , there are two types of four - quark operators present in the effective theory , one of which contains an insertion of a transverse collinear gluon field . upon evaluating hadronic matrix elements of such operators between a @xmath2 meson and a light , energetic meson , one finds that in addition to the leading - twist distribution amplitude of the light meson also three - particle distribution amplitudes of subleading twist can contribute at leading power .",
    "this suggests that , in some cases , qcd factorization formulae may have to be generalized .",
    "we have presented a toy example where this extension is indeed necessary .",
    "our results for the matching of currents and four - quark operators suggest a reformulation of soft - collinear effective theory in terms of operators composed out of gauge - invariant building blocks replacing the original quark and gluon fields . in the new formulation gauge invariance",
    "is automatic , and the form of operators is only constrained by lorentz invariance .",
    "we anticipate that this observation will facilitate the extension of our results beyond the leading order .",
    "the formalism developed in this work provides for the first time the basis for a systematic discussion of factorization and power corrections for any @xmath2-meson decay into light particles .",
    "phenomenological applications of this framework will be discussed elsewhere .    while this paper was in writing the work @xcite appeared , in which factorization for the leptonic radiative decay @xmath358 is discussed in the context of soft - collinear effective theory .",
    "while the formalism used in that work differs from the one developed here , part of the discussion presented by these authors realizes the idea of two - step matching mentioned at the end of section  [ sec:4qops ] .",
