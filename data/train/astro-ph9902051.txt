    "the study of primordial chemistry of molecules addresses a number of interesting questions pertaining to the thermal balance of collapsing molecular protoclouds . in numerous astrophysical cases",
    "molecular cooling and heating influence dynamical evolution of the medium , see for example the review done by dalgarno and mc cray ( 1972 ) who present molecular cooling and heating in hi regions , or shu ( 1997 ) who discusses the influence of molecules in star formation .",
    "+ the existence of a significant abundance of molecules can be crucial on the dynamical evolution of collapsing objects . because the cloud temperature increases with contraction",
    ", a cooling mechanism can be important for the structure formation , by lowering pressure opposing gravity , i.e. by allowing continued collapse of jeans unstable protoclouds .",
    "this is particularly true for the first generation of objects .",
    "many authors have examined this problem ( bodenheimer 1968 , hutchins 1976 , palla et al 1983 , villere & bodenheimer 1987 , tegmark et al 1997 ) introducing molecular coolants , mainly @xmath0 molecules . from fall and rees ( 1985 ) we know that @xmath0 molecules are important cooling agents and can lead , sometimes , to the fragmentation process of the object and thus provide a possible scenario of globular cluster formation for collapsing galaxies .",
    "+ recently puy and signore ( 1997 ) , bougleux and galli ( 1997 ) showed that during the early stages of gravitational collapse , for some collapsing masses , @xmath1 molecules were the main cooling agent when the collapsing protostructure had a temperature of about 200 kelvins . in our last papers ( puy and signore 1997 , 1998 )",
    "we have numerically calculated the cooling functions for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 molecules by considering the excitation of the twenty first rotational levels .",
    "@xmath0 is an homonuclear molecule , so radiative transitions within the lowest electronic state involve only quadrupole transitions , @xmath4 . between two rotational levels , @xmath5 the energy of the transition is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the temperature of the quadrupolar transition @xmath8 , @xmath9 the rotational constant ( for @xmath0 , @xmath10 kelvins ) and @xmath11 the boltzmann constant .",
    "due to the non - zero dipole moment the transitions involve dipolar transitions , @xmath12 .",
    "thus the energy of the transition @xmath13 is given by : @xmath14 @xmath15 is the temperature of the dipolar transition @xmath16 , @xmath17 kelvins for @xmath1 and @xmath18 kelvins for @xmath2 .",
    "+ in this paper we consider a collapsing molecular protocloud made up only of @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules .",
    "we do not consider collisions with @xmath19 atoms because we consider only the central part of the cloud where the molecules are present . in this picture @xmath19",
    "is less heavier and is confined in the circumcloud .",
    "moreover , we do not consider the evolution of abundances .",
    "puy & signore ( 1998 ) showed that the evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 abundance was low , and abundance of @xmath2 was negligible ( see also stancil et al .",
    "thus , the constant ratio @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are respectively the density of @xmath0 and the density of @xmath1 ) around the primordial ratio @xmath23 ( in the framework of the standard big bang nucleosynthesis , see puy et al 1993 ) . + in section 2 , we recall the primordial chemistry . in section 3 , with these approximations , we analytically calculate the population of the ground state level and first state level in order to evaluate the molecular cooling and molecular heating due to @xmath1 and @xmath0 molecules . in section 4 , we estimate the molecular cooling during the collapse of protoclouds . then , in section 5 , the possibility of thermal instability during the early phase of gravitational collapse is discussed .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we suggest that this study could be extended to @xmath3 molecules which have been recently detected at redshifts @xmath24 ( ohta et al 1996 , omont et al 1996 , guilloteau et al 1997 ) .",
    "in standard big bang theory , chemistry took place around the epoch of recombination . at z@xmath25 1000",
    "the chemical species essentially were ( see signore & puy 1999 ) : @xmath26 as the universe expanded and cooled , different routes led to molecular formation .",
    "many authors have described in detail primordial molecular formation and evolution ; in particular , puy et al . ( 1993 ) have simultaneously solved the coupled chemical equations and the density and temperature evolution equations . finally with initial conditions given by the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( signore & puy 1999 )",
    ", we obtain the following abundances ( see puy & signore 1999 ) : @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 in the following due to the very low abundance of @xmath2 we will consider only the primordial molecules @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we consider here only the transition between the ground state and the first state . due to the existence of a permanent dipolar moment for @xmath1 ( @xmath30 debye , abgrall et al 1982 ) ,",
    "the transition concerning @xmath1 molecule is a dipolar transition whereas for @xmath0 molecule the transition is quadrupolar ( because it has no permanent dipolar moment ) .",
    "the excitation of the ground state is radiative or collisional , the equations of evolution concerning the populations ( @xmath31 for the ground state @xmath32 , @xmath33 for the first excited state @xmath34 ) are given by :    @xmath35 x_o^{hd } -   \\bigl [ a_{1,0}^{hd } + c_{1,0}^{hd } + b_{1,0}^{hd } u^{hd}_{1,0 } \\bigr ] x_1^{hd } \\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath36 x_1^{hd } - \\bigl [ c_{0,1}^{hd } + b_{0,1}^{hd } u^{hd}_{0,1 }   \\bigr ] x_o^{hd } \\nonumber\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the collisional coefficients characterizing the collisions between @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in the approximation of maxwell - boltzmann distribution",
    "we have : @xmath39 with @xmath40 the transition temperature between @xmath41 , @xmath42 the temperature of the matter inside the collapsing cloud , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the einstein coefficients . the radiative density is @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the corresponding frequency and temperature , @xmath48 the planck constant , @xmath49 the velocity of the light and @xmath50 the temperature of the background radiation . @xmath51 characterizes the einstein coefficient for the spontaneous emission ( see kutner 1984 ) and @xmath52 kelvins the rotational constant ( see herzberg 1950 ) .",
    "+ we have the following normalisation for the populations : @xmath53 moreover we consider a quasi - instantaneous transition so @xmath54 thus from these approximations we find for the populations @xmath33 and @xmath31 : @xmath55 and @xmath56 the probability of collisional de - excitation is given by @xmath57 and the probability of radiative de - excitation : @xmath58 thus , we can calculate the molecular cooling ( collisional excitation followed by a radiative de - excitation ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the energy for the transition @xmath41 .",
    "+ the molecular heating ( radiative excitation followed by collisional de - excitation ) is : @xmath61    if we take into account the following relation between the einstein coefficients : @xmath62 then we deduce for the molecular cooling @xmath63 + c_{1,0}^{hd } \\bigl [ 1 + 3 exp(-\\frac{t_{1,0}^{hd}}{t_m } ) \\bigr ] \\bigl [ exp(\\frac{t_{1,0}^{hd}}{t_r } ) -1 \\bigr ] } \\ ] ] and for the molecular heating @xmath64 + c_{1,0}^{hd } \\bigl [ 1 + 3 exp(-\\frac{t_{1,0}^{hd}}{t_m } ) \\bigr ] \\bigl [ exp(\\frac{t_{1,0}^{hd}}{t_r } ) -1 \\bigr ] } \\ ] ] notice that calculating the ratio molecular cooling to molecular heating we obtain the following simple expression @xmath65\\ ] ] this relation gives us an important information concerning the thermal influence of the thermal function @xmath66 during a gravitational collapse .",
    "when the matter temperature @xmath42 is higher than the radiative temperature , we have @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 so molecules cool the collapsing cloud .",
    "thus during a gravitational collapse , the matter temperature of the collapsing cloud is higher than the radiative temperature of the cosmological background ( let us recall that in our case we do not consider some external sources like quasars , first stars etc ... ) .",
    "+ thus in this study , we consider only the molecular cooling which is the dominant term in the cooling function as we have shown for a collapsing cloud ( puy & signore 1996 ) .",
    "moreover if we compare the temperature of the dipolar transition for @xmath1 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 k with the temperature of the cosmological radiation between the redshifts @xmath71 $ ] , i.e. @xmath72 $ ] , we can approximate : @xmath73 and @xmath74 therefore , with these approximations , we obtain for the cooling function of @xmath1 ( eq .",
    "9 ) the expression : @xmath75}\\ ] ]      concerning the @xmath0 molecules , the analysis is the same than that for the @xmath1 molecules with the difference that the studied transitions are quadrupolar . because of the increased number of charged particle regions with molecules ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ... ) , the heating mechanism is different from and more complicated than that of atomic regions .",
    "we focus our calculations only on the first transition @xmath76 .",
    "the other transitions are negligible because we consider the early phase of gravitational collapse where the matter temperature is below 200 kelvins which is much lower than the transition temperatures for @xmath0 molecules ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the einstein coefficients for the spontaneous emission and for the first transition are given by ( see kutner 1984 ) : @xmath77 the relations between the einstein coefficients are @xmath78 and the radiative density for the transition is : @xmath79 and for the collisional coefficients in the maxwell - bolztmann distribution approximation : @xmath80 by analogy with the @xmath1 molecules and with the same levels of approximations @xmath81 and @xmath82 thus , from the eqs ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , we find for the populations @xmath83 and @xmath84 : @xmath85 @xmath86 the probability of radiative de - excitation becomes @xmath87 while the molecular cooling for the @xmath0 molecule is given by : @xmath88 } \\ ] ]      the collisional coefficients are given by the expressions :    @xmath89    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the collisional cross section and @xmath21 the density of @xmath0 ; @xmath92 and @xmath93 are respectively the velocity of @xmath1 and @xmath0 given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the hydrogen mass .",
    "notice that , in our model , @xmath0 molecules are more abundant than @xmath1 molecules , so @xmath0 molecules are the main collisional species .",
    "the total cooling function is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the ratio between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cooling functions .",

    "we study a homologous model of spherical collapse of mass @xmath101 similar to the model adopted in lahav ( 1986 ) and puy & signore ( 1996 ) in which we only consider @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules .",
    "+ we have seen ( puy & signore 1997 ) from a numerical integration of the cooling functions where twenty rotational levels were considered that molecular cooling is important .",
    "moreover we have shown that below 200 kelvins the main cooling agent is the @xmath1 molecule .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyse , through our approximations ( where the only two first excited levels are considered ) , the evolution of the cooling and the potentiality of thermal instability .",
    "+ first , let us recall the equations governing dynamics of a collapsing protocloud : @xmath102 for the evolution of the matter temperature @xmath42 , @xmath103 for the evolution of the radius @xmath104 of the collapsing cloud and @xmath105 for the evolution of the matter density @xmath106 .",
    "+ at the beginning of the gravitational collapse the matter temperature increases , then due to the very important efficiency of the molecular cooling , the temperature decreases .",
    "we consider here this _ transition regime _",
    "i.e. the point where the temperature curve has a horizontal asymptot ( see puy & signore 1997 ) : @xmath107 and where the cooling due to molecules can exceed the heating resulting from the collapse . from the equation ( 22 ) of the evolution of the matter temperature ,",
    "we deduce @xmath108 note that the total molecular cooling is negative ( @xmath109 ) . moreover , because we consider the early phase of the gravitational collapse , we can approximate to a free fall collapse and so the pressure term , @xmath110 , is negligible in the equation ( 23 ) .",
    "thus , the evolution equation of the radius can be written : @xmath111 which leads to @xmath112 moreover , because we know that the evolution of the density is : @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are respectively the density and the radius at the beginning of the collapse .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath116 we have seen that the regime of temperature that we consider is below 200 kelvins .",
    "moreover , the abundances of @xmath1 and @xmath0 remain roughly constant during the early phase of the gravitational collapse ( puy & signore 1997 , 1998 ) . in this case",
    ", the value of the density of @xmath1 at the beginning of the collapse is @xmath117 @xmath118 .",

    "we have learned much about thermal instability in the last 30 years since the appearance of the work of field ( 1965 ) .",
    "many studies have focused on the problem of thermal instabilitie in different situations : formation of galaxies ( sofue 1969 ) , expanding medium ( kondo 1970 ) , formation of protostars ( stein et al .",
    "1972 ) , formation of globular clusters ( fall & rees 1985 ) , cooling flows ( david et al . 1988 ) and quasar clouds ( mathews & doane 1990 ) .",
    "+ the correct instability criterion can be derived physically as follows . in an infinite , uniform , static medium of density @xmath114 and @xmath124 ,",
    "the continuity and force equations are automatically satisfied . if we introduce a perturbation of density and temperature such that some thermodynamics variable ( pressure , temperature ... ) is held constant , the entropy of the material @xmath138 will change by an amount @xmath139 , and the heat - loss function , by an amount @xmath140 . from the equation",
    "@xmath141 there is instability only if : @xmath142 we know that @xmath143 in an isobaric perturbation . the corresponding inequality can be written : @xmath144 which characterizes the field s criterion .",
    "the criterion involves constant @xmath145 because small blobs tend to maintain pressure equilibrium with their surroundings when heating and cooling get out of balance . in our case ( i.e. at the transition regime )",
    ", a thermal instability could spontaneously be developped if the field s criterion is verified : @xmath146 in our case the logaritmic differential of the total molecular cooling function is given by @xmath147 therefore , the criterion is independant of the mass @xmath101 of the cloud at the transition regime . in figure 1 , we have plotted the curve @xmath148 .",
    "it shows that the _ field s criterion _ is always verified .",
    "+ we conclude that a thermal instability is possible at the _ transition regime _ ,",
    "i.e. at @xmath149 , when cooling ( due to molecules ) exceeds heating ( due essentially to the collapse ) .",
    "thus by maintening the same pressure in its surroundings , such a blob would get cooler and cooler and denser and denser until it could separate into miniblobs .",
    "this possibility is very interesting and could give a scenario of formation of primordial clouds .",
    "however , a quantitative study is necessary to evaluate the order of magnitude of the mass and the size of the clouds .",
    "this last point can be crucial particularly concerning the composition of the molecular clouds at high redshift such as the lyman-@xmath150 absorbers in order to evaluate the possible signatures of the primordial clouds .",
    "in the very early universe the components of the primordial molecular medium are formed from the elements of the primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "later , as soon as stellar processes occur in proto - objects , other molecular species appeared such as @xmath3 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , their line emission can be seen as an excellent probe of physical conditions of very high redshift objects . among them , the diatomic molecule @xmath3 has the strongest lines at radio wavelengths , the rotational transitions being spaced by 115 ghz in the rest frame at @xmath153 ( this separation , at a redshift @xmath154 , becomes compressed by a factor @xmath155 ) .",
    "moreover , the carbon monoxide line emission had already been detected in four high redshift objects :    1 .",
    "@xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 in the ultraluminous ir galaxy f10215 + 4724 at the redshift @xmath159 ( brown and van den bout 1992 , solomon et al 1992 ) .",
    "2 .   @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 in the cloverleaf quasar at the redshift @xmath162 ( barvainis et al 1994 , barvainis et al 1997 ) .",
    "@xmath160 in the quasar br1202 - 0725 at the redshift @xmath163 ( ohta et al 1996 , omont et al 1996 ) .",
    "4 .   @xmath160 in the quasar bri1335 - 0418 at the redshift @xmath164 ( guilloteau et al 1997 ) .",
    "one must also add that , at least for the first three objects , their detectability in molecular transitions may be due to high emissivity of the gas and above all magnification from gravitational lensing rather than an extremely large mass of gas .",
    "moreover , there is no a priori evidence of gravitational lensing for bri1335 - 0418 .",
    "therefore , if this absence of strong gravitational magnification is confirmed , the fourth object could have a large mass of molecular gas which could be associated with the presence of some huge starburst .",
    "however , if there is no doubt about the reality of the @xmath3 detection in these objects , it is more difficult to definitively determine the @xmath3 to @xmath0 conversion factor in these objects .",
    "+ let us also remark that , here , we study _ protostructures _ in the mass range @xmath165 m@xmath166 i.e. in the mass range of dwarf galaxies .",
    "recently , verter & hodge ( 1995 ) estimated the @xmath3 to @xmath0 conversion factor for the very low metallicity dwarf irregular galaxy gr8 .",
    "they found @xmath167 molecules @xmath168 ( km s@xmath169)@xmath169 which is a factor 30 larger than for our galaxy ( @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the column density of molecular hydrogen gas and @xmath172 is the integration of @xmath3 antenna temperature over the velocity profile ) .",
    "+ therefore , from these estimations , the calculations of molecular functions could , in principle , be extended to the @xmath3 molecules for collapsing protoclouds at @xmath173 .",
    "the @xmath3 molecules could even be a better cooling agent than @xmath0 and @xmath1 for some temperature ranges .",
    "but , in any case -and in particular for the discussion of thermal instability at the _ transition regime_- the corresponding total cooling function must be numerically calculated because the excitation of many rotational levels must be taken into account .",
    "this extended study is beyond the scope of our paper .",
