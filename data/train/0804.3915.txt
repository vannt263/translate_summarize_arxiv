    "applications of fractional calculus , in particular fractional differential equations , in transport phenomena in complex and disordered media have attracted considerable attention during the past two decades @xcite . however , the use of fractional calculus in quantum theory is still very limited .",
    "recently , generalization of quantum mechanics based on fractional schrodinger equation has been considered by several authors @xcite . in quantum field theory , fractional klein - gordon equation @xcite and fractional dirac equation @xcite",
    "were introduced several years ago , but further studies on these topics are scarce .",
    "it was only lately that the canonical and stochastic quantization of fractional klein - gordon field and fractional maxwell field have been carried out @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall consider another aspect of fractional klein - gordon field , namely , the casimir effect associated with such a field .",
    "this work is partly motivated by the recent advances in cosmology , in particular the solid evidences for accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite , which have rekindled considerable interest in casimir effect @xcite .",
    "casimir energy in extra space - time dimensions @xcite has been proposed as a possible candidates of dark energy @xcite that is responsible for the accelerated cosmic expansion .",
    "however , in this paper , we shall not deal directly on the link between casimir energy and the dark energy . instead , we shall study the link between the possible repulsive nature of the casimir force and the general boundary conditions associated with fractional massless klein - gordon field .    in most consideration of casimir energy between a pair of parallel plates ,",
    "the boundary conditions employed are either of dirichlet type or neumann type for both of the plates .",
    "a less common pair of parallel plates has been suggested by boyer @xcite , with one of them perfectly conducting and the other infinitely permeable .",
    "boyer was able to show in the context of random electrodynamics that for such a set - up the resulting casimir force is repulsive .",
    "it is possible to show that this unusual pair of plates necessitates mixed boundary conditions , with the dirichlet condition for the perfectly conducting plate , and neumann condition for the infinitely permeable plate .",
    "recently , this result has been derived by several authors using the zeta function method for scalar massless field at zero temperature @xcite and finite temperature @xcite .    since this paper studies casimir effect associated with fractional klein - gordon field , it is not unnatural for one to consider the fractional generalization of neumann conditions involving fractional derivatives .",
    "we shall study how repulsive casimir force due to the fractional massless klein - gordon field can arise under a new type of boundary conditions , the fractional derivative boundary conditions ( or fractional neumann conditions ) .",
    "we show that such conditions allow interpolation between the ordinary dirichlet and neumann conditions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we first recall some basic facts about fractional klein - gordon field at zero and finite temperature . in section 3",
    ", we derive the partition function and free energy between parallel plates associated with the fractional massless scalar field at positive temperature using the generalized thermal zeta function regularization technique .",
    "we show that the casimir force associated with the massless fractional scalar field can change from attraction to repulsion as the order of the fractional neumann conditions imposed on the parallel plates is varied .",
    "finally we obtain the low and high temperature limits of various physical quantities such as free energy and pressure .",
    "the temperature inversion symmetry @xcite will also be discussed .",
    "in this section , we recall briefly some basic theory of fractional derivative fields .",
    "let us consider the euclidean scalar field @xmath3 , @xmath4 with the following lagrangian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the @xmath7dimensional euclidean laplacian operator , and @xmath8 is a pseudo - differential operator @xcite . in order to consider @xmath8 of fractional order which contains the fractional powers @xmath9 of laplacian operator , we need to define the riesz fractional derivative and integral @xcite in order to give these operators a precise meaning . for a test function in schwartz space ( or a tempered distribution ) @xmath10 ,",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath11 satisfies @xmath12",
    ". this can be generalized to fractional power of laplacian operator . for our purpose , it is sufficient to consider only the real fractional powers . for @xmath13 , and schwartz functions",
    "@xmath10 we define @xmath14 the operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 defined in for @xmath17 are called respectively the riesz fractional integral operator and riesz fractional differential operator .",
    "we have @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 for `` sufficiently good '' functions @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath8 in can be expanded in a power series @xmath21 , and it can be regarded as a differential operator of infinite order of derivatives . from the lagrangian field theory with higher order derivatives",
    "@xcite one gets @xmath22 and by summing up the series gives the nonlocal field equation @xmath23 .",
    "nonlocal field theory with @xmath24 as the fractional klein - gordon operator has been considered by several authors @xcite .",
    "higher derivative field theories involving propagator of the form @xmath25 were first used by pais and uhlenbeck @xcite to obtain a regularized theory without ultraviolet behavior .",
    "fields with such propagators result in either theories with ghost states that require a hilbert space with indefinite metric , or nonlocal theories without ghost states .    here",
    "we give some remarks on the motivations for introducing fractional derivative fields .",
    "field theories with nonlocal lagrangian of the type with nolocality due to kinetic terms have attracted considerable interest . for examples ,",
    "nonlocal kinetic term plays an important role in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional bosonization @xcite ; it also arises in effective field theories when some degrees of freedom are integrated out in the underlying local field theory @xcite .",
    "one also expects fractional derivative quantum fields to play an important role in quantum theories of mesoscopic systems and soft condensed matter which exhibit fractal character .",
    "such argument can be extended to quantum field theories in fractal space - time @xcite .",
    "canonical quantization of nonlocal scalar fractional klein - gordon field has been considered by amaral and marino @xcite , and barci , oxman and rocca @xcite .",
    "free relativistic wave equations with fractional powers of dalembertian operator were studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "stochastic quantization of fractional klein - gordon and fractional abelian gauge field has been considered by lim and muniandy @xcite , and finite temperature fractional klein - gordon field is considered in a recent work @xcite .",
    "the two - point schwinger function of the euclidean fractional klein - gordon field is given by @xmath26 for the euclidean fractional klein - gordon field at finite temperature @xmath27 satisfying the periodic condition @xmath28 , the two - point schwinger function becomes @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the two point schwinger functions for the massless field are given by and by putting @xmath33 .",
    "in the next section , we shall carry out the computation of casimir energy associated with the massless fractional klein - gordon field confined between two parallel plates imposed with fractional neumann boundary conditions .",
    "the thermal zeta function technique will be employed in our calculation .",
    "zeta function method was introduced as regularization procedure in quantum field theory about two decades ago @xcite .",
    "basically the zeta function technique involves three steps . in the case for scalar massless fractional klein - gordon field",
    "they are : ( i ) determination of the eigenvalues @xmath34 of @xmath9 with appropriate boundary conditions , hence the spectral zeta function @xmath35 .",
    "( ii ) analytic continuation of the zeta function @xmath36 to a meromorphic function of the entire complex plane .",
    "( iii ) evaluation of @xmath37 in terms of @xmath38 , that is , @xmath39 . for simplicity",
    ", the computation will be carried out for scalar massless fractional klein - gordon field .",
    "however , one can mimic the electromagnetic field by the scalar massless field with the two transverse polarization states of the former taken care of by multiplying the end results by a factor of two plus some minor modifications on the possible eigenmodes of the field . in this way",
    ", we can compare our results to some other established results .",
    "we first assume that the fractional klein - gordon field @xmath40 is inside a @xmath41dimensional space @xmath42 which is a rectangular box @xmath43\\times\\ldots\\times[0 , l_{d-1}]\\times [ 0,d]$ ] such that @xmath44 @xmath45 . at the end , we let @xmath46 approach infinity to obtain space between the two hyperplanes @xmath47 and @xmath48 in @xmath49 . we want to consider massless fractional klein - gordon field confined in the region @xmath42 and maintained in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath27 . as usual @xcite",

    "we use the definition of fractional derivative in terms of fourier transform : @xmath64where@xmath65and @xmath66 is the fourier transform of @xmath67 .",
    "when @xmath68 , one gets the dirichlet condition for both the plates . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath69 , the boundary conditions for both plates are that of neumann type . in the case with either @xmath70 , @xmath71 or @xmath72 , we have the boyer type boundary condition . for values of @xmath73 other than the above values , we have fractional neumann boundary condition for both plates .",
    "one can naively regard such boundary conditions as correspond to plates which are not perfectly conducting or infinitely permeable .",

    "when the two parallel plates are both perfectly conduction , except for the factor of two , it is almost equivalent to the dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , an additional @xmath179 of the @xmath191 modes must be added .",
    "this amounts to the omission of the second term in .",

    "in boyer s setup , where one plate is perfectly conduction and the other is infinitely permeable , the result for electromagnetic field should be twice the result for massless scalar field under boyer s boundary condition .",
    "in fact , when @xmath139 and @xmath190 , twice of the formula agree with the result obtained in @xcite .    by these comparisons with electromagnetic field , one can provide a heuristic interpretation regarding the fractional neumann boundary conditions imposed on the parallel plates as their deviation from the perfect conductivity and infinite permeability .",
    "by taking @xmath198 in and , we have the low temperature ( @xmath199 or @xmath200 ) expansion of the free energy density , i.e. when @xmath148 , @xmath201and when @xmath202 , @xmath203from @xcite , pg 223 , we have the following asymptotic expansion for @xmath204 : @xmath205where @xmath206when @xmath207 is equal to half of an odd integer , the sum in is finite and the right hand side of is the exact formula for @xmath208 . from the asymptotic expansion , we see that when @xmath209 , @xmath210is exponentially decay and the leading term is obtained by setting @xmath211 , which results in @xmath212similarly , when @xmath213 , the @xmath214 term gives @xmath215when @xmath180 , the @xmath216 terms give @xmath217 these imply that for low temperature @xmath199 , when @xmath148 , @xmath218when @xmath219 , @xmath220 and finally when @xmath180,@xmath221 from these , we also find that the zero temperature energy density is @xmath222this term depends on @xmath223 .",
