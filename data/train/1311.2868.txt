    "a space filling curve is a continuous curve that covers completely the d - dimensional space . in mathematical terms , is a surjective mapping from @xmath0 .",
    "the concept was described by peano and shortly after , hilbert introduced , in two dimensions ( 2d ) , an optimized space filling curve that now bears his name @xcite .",
    "hilbert curves have found applications in several fields including , computer science @xcite , manufacturing engineering @xcite , imaging processing @xcite , data visualization @xcite , and the traveling salesman problem @xcite , among others .",
    "the wealth of applications stems from the good locality preserving properties of such curves , meaning that neighbors interval in the one dimensional curve , are fairly well clustered in the @xmath1 mapping @xcite .    in spite that the original hilbert construction is dealt almost exclusively , there are several hilbert curves for a given dimension .",
    "haverkort @xcite discussed the set of hilbert curves in three dimensions , finding more than @xmath2 possible variants of hilbert curves . in 2d , already moore described a curve that is named after him @xcite .",
    "more recently , liu has discussed four alternative patterns of the hilbert curve in 2d @xcite . yet",
    ", liu description is somewhat confusing , and the description of the generating process incomplete .    in this contribution",
    "the complete set of homogeneous hilbert curves in 2d are reported . in doing so",
    ", six new patterns are introduced .",
    "the recursive , analytical , generation of all twelve patterns is discussed , which allows to follow the logic of the construction for such curves .",
    "the hilbert curves are also described in terms of a tag - system .",
    "for a given @xmath3 , the unit segment @xmath4 $ ] is divided into @xmath5 non - overlapping intervals @xmath6 of equal length , that completely covers the original segment .",
    "correspondingly , the unit square @xmath4 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] is partitioned into @xmath5 non - overlapping squares @xmath7 of equal area , that completely covers the original square .",
    "a mapping can be set from @xmath6 onto @xmath7 .",
    "we proceed as follows : for @xmath8 the unit segment @xmath4 $ ] is divided in such a way , that each @xmath9 is partitioned into four equal length segments @xmath10 , each of them belonging to @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , each @xmath12 is partitioned into four equal squares @xmath13 , each of them belonging to @xmath14 . in this way",
    "results an infinite sequence of @xmath6 @xmath15 partitions of the unit segment , and a corresponding sequence of @xmath16 @xmath15 partitions of the unit square .",
    "the following two conditions are imposed to the mapping from @xmath17 onto @xmath16 ( hilbert conditions ) :    1 .   for a fixed @xmath3 ,",
    "two adjacent intervals @xmath18 will be mapped to two adjacent squares ( sharing an edge ) @xmath19 .",
    "2 .   taken @xmath9 ,",
    "let @xmath12 be the corresponding square under the mapping then , if @xmath20 is one of the intervals in the partition of @xmath21 , its image @xmath22 under the mapping , will be one of the squares in the partition of @xmath23 .",
    "hilbert conditions do not uniquely determine the mapping between @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite . in order to fix uniquely the mapping ,",
    "boundary conditions must be imposed , by stating to which squares @xmath24 and @xmath23 , will the initial @xmath25 and final @xmath26 interval be mapped to , respectively .",
    "hilbert curve will then be the space filling curve resulting from the limit process @xmath27 .",
    "the mapping @xmath28 is also known as the hilbert curve approximation of order @xmath3 , the term hilbert curve will be used for this approximation of order @xmath3 , as the context will make its use unambiguous .    in",
    "what follows , all hilbert curves related by rotation , mirror or reversal operations will be considered equivalent .",
    "as the unit square is divided into quadrants , it is needed to specify the connectivity between quadrants .",
    "quadrants will be numbered in clockwise order , starting from the left lower quadrant , and connectivity will follow the same order : @xmath29 .",
    "there is no connectivity between quadrant @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( figure [ fig : quadrants ] ) .    for @xmath32 ,",
    "there is only one possible hilbert curve @xmath33 , depicted in figure [ fig : h1 ] .",
    "the circle flags the starting or entry point of the curve , and the arrow head , the ending or exit point of the curve .    for @xmath34",
    ", hilbert s conditions result in the curves shown in figure [ fig : h2 ] . curve [ fig : h2]a1 is the original hilbert curve , which will be denoted by @xmath35 ; curve [ fig : h2]b1 is the one described by moore , which will be denoted by @xmath36 ; while curves [ fig : h2]a2 to [ fig : h2]b4 , are the four curves described by liu @xcite , and will be numbered from @xmath37 to @xmath38 in row scan order .",
    "it can be seen , that the six curves in figure [ fig : h2 ] have in each quadrant , a @xmath39-scaled @xmath33 curve , rotated or mirror reflected , if the @xmath40 curve is described by the rotation or mirror operation , carried out to the scaled @xmath41 for each quadrant then , the six curves @xmath42 can be depicted as shown on figure [ fig : h2op ] .",
    "it follows , that constructing @xmath40 from @xmath41 involves an affine transformation @xmath43 of @xmath41 for each quadrant @xmath44 .",
    "the affine transformation @xmath43 has a scaling rotational part described by a @xmath45 matrix , and a translation given by a vector .    for the original hilbert curve @xmath35 ( figure [ fig : h2]a1 )",
    ", the affine transformation will be given by    @xmath46    where @xmath43 transform the @xmath41 curve into the curve in the @xmath44-quadrant of the @xmath40 mapping .",
    "for the moore curve @xmath36 ( figure [ fig : h2]b1 ) , the affine transformation will be given by    @xmath47    the affine transformation for the four curves described by liu @xcite , will be    @xmath48    for @xmath49 ( figure [ fig : h2]a2 ) ;    @xmath50    for @xmath37 ( figure [ fig : h2]b2 ) ;    @xmath51    for @xmath52 ( figure [ fig : h2]a3 ) ;    @xmath53    for @xmath38 ( figure [ fig : h2]b3 ) .",
    "it could be considered straight forward to apply recursively the corresponding affine transformation of each hilbert curve to @xmath54 , in order to obtain @xmath55 .",
    "the problem is , that except for @xmath35 , applying @xmath56 to @xmath57 will render impossible to achieve the desired quadrant connectivity for @xmath58 ( a point missed in liu description @xcite ) .",
    "instead , to build @xmath54 , @xmath59 is constructed by applying recursively @xmath60 and then , @xmath54 is built , by applying @xmath56 to @xmath59 . the result for @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "are shown in figure [ fig : h3 ] and figure [ fig : h4 ] .",
    "by construction , the only hilbert curves @xmath54 that can be used to generate a higher order curve @xmath55 , are those with initial and ending point at adjacent corners or edges .",
    "inspection of figure [ fig : h2 ] shows , that only @xmath35 and @xmath38 are candidate generating curves .",
    "@xmath35 was already used for the construction of the first six curves .    as already said , for all curves , other than @xmath35 , the recursive application of their corresponding affine mapping , does not yield a well connected @xmath55 curve . in order to construct a higher order hilbert curve from @xmath38 ,",
    "a new operation called reversion is introduced , which exchange the entry and exit point of the @xmath54 curve , as described in figure [ fig : swap ] .",
    "six new hilbert curves can be constructed using the reversion operation .",
    "such curves will be called improper hilbert curves , to differentiate them from the earlier six curves . in terms of the affine transformation performed in each quadrant ,",
    "the new curves are described in figure [ fig : handimproper ] .",
    "the curves for @xmath61 and @xmath62 are shown in figures [ fig : improper3 ] and [ fig : improper4 ] , respectively .",
    "the affine transformation for the first curve @xmath63 will be    @xmath64    but now the bar over the @xmath65 and @xmath66 means , that besides the affine transformation , the reversion operation also acts over @xmath38 . for the second improper hilbert curve @xmath67 , the affine transformation will be    @xmath68    for the third improper hilbert curve @xmath69 , the affine transformation will be    @xmath70    for the fourth improper hilbert curve @xmath71 , the affine transformation will be    @xmath72    for the fifth improper hilbert curve @xmath73 , the affine transformation will be    @xmath74    for the last improper hilbert curve @xmath75 , the affine transformation will be    @xmath76    hilbert curves @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath49 , @xmath37 , @xmath63 , @xmath69 , @xmath71 and @xmath73 are mirror symmetric with respect to a vertical line at half the unit square .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath49 , @xmath63 and @xmath71 are closed curves in the sense of having the entry and exit point in adjacent squares , such curves are useful , for example , in the traveling salesman problem @xcite .",
    "as already stated , the only building blocks for higher order hilbert curves are those curves with entry and exit points in different adjacent edges or corners .",
    "the reason for that , is the way quadrants are visited ( figure [ fig : quadrants ] ) .",
    "continuity of the hilbert curve , together with the connectivity scheme @xmath77 impose constrains on the possible building block and their orientation in each quadrant . as already seen , only hilbert original curve @xmath35 ( figure [ fig : h2]-1a ) and @xmath38 ( figure [ fig : h2]-3b ) can be used for that purpose .",
    "hilbert curves are uniquely determined by their boundary conditions , and each curve preserves their boundary condition for any order @xcite .",
    "sagan has explained the approximating polygonal construction to depict hilbert curves @xcite . for our purpose , it will suffice to say that in each quadrant , the entry and exit point can be represented as a vector going from the former the latter .",
    "such vector will be called the boundary vector ( bvector ) . in such a way , uniqueness of the space filling curve",
    "can be described by just showing the bvector at each quadrant , regardless of the curve order . as already stated ,",
    "two hilbert curves are considered equivalent if they are related by a rotation , reflection or reversion operation , correspondingly , bvectors diagrams are equivalent if they are related by any of the described operations .",
    "therefore , a set of equivalent bvector diagrams gives rise to only one distinctive hilbert curve .",
    "figure [ fig : boundaryvector ] , shows the bvectors for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "homogeneous curves have been defined as those built from just one building block .",
    "homogeneous hilbert curve of any order , can only be described by suitable rotations , reflections or both , of the corresponding boundary vector at each quadrant while preserving continuity between connected quadrants .    for the proper curves",
    "there are only four possible orientation for the boundary vector in the first quadrant which results in a curve connected to the second quadrant ( figure [ fig : propercomplete]-i ) . once the boundary vector for the first quadrant is fixed , the boundary vectors for the second and third quadrants are also fixed by the quadrant connectivity ( figure [ fig : propercomplete]-ii , iii ) . for the fourth quadrant",
    "there are two choices for each case , as there is no connectivity constrain at the ending point and this results in the eight boundary vectors diagram of figure [ fig : propercomplete]-iv .",
    "the diagrams 1a and 3b form an  enantiomorphic  pair that give rise to two equivalent hilbert curves related by a mirror - reversion operation , the same goes for the  enantiomorphic  pair 2b-4b .",
    "both enantiomorphic pairs contribute with one non - equivalent hilbert curve .",
    "for the improper curves the analysis follow the same lines .",
    "again there are four possibles boundary vectors for the first quadrant ( figure [ fig : impropercomplete]-i ) , which fix the boundary vector for the second and third quadrant ( figure [ fig : impropercomplete]-ii , iii ) .",
    "the liberty of choice in the fourth quadrant leads to a total of eight improper boundary vector diagrams ( figure [ fig : impropercomplete]-iv ) .",
    "diagrams pairs 1b-2b and 3b-4b are mirror symmetric and therefore lead to equivalent  enantiomorphic  hilbert curves .",
    "there are thus , a total of six non - equivalent improper hilbert curves .",
    "all possible non equivalent boundary vector diagrams have been exhausted and therefore , all possible constructions for the proper and improper hilbert curves .",
    "it is in this sense that it is claimed that the described twelve curves ( six proper and six improper ) , exhaust all possible homogeneous hilbert curves in two dimensions .",
    "it must be pointed out that new hilbert curves can be built if the homogeneity condition is dropped , and curves of order @xmath3 are allowed to mix @xmath59 and @xmath80 curves at different quadrants . in fact , in such case , up to @xmath81 different hilbert curves in 2d can be built , results will be published elsewhere .",
    "hilbert curves can be viewed as drawings , where the point is never removed from the surface of the paper , made of succession of unit length lines that can go up , down , right or left .",
    "this allows to define an alphabet @xmath82 , where @xmath83 stands for _ up _",
    ", @xmath84 for _ down _ , @xmath85 for _ right _ and @xmath86 for _ left_. a given hilbert curve @xmath41 can now be encoded by a finite length word , with symbols taken from @xmath87 , describing the pen stroke at each step .",
    "for example , @xmath88 will be encoded by the word @xmath89 , while @xmath90 will be given by @xmath91 .",
    "the tag system describing the hilbert construction is then , the rules that transforms a word @xmath92 , encoding @xmath41 , to the word @xmath93 that describes @xmath40 . for the original hilbert curve @xmath35 ,",
    "seebold @xcite reported the following tag system :    @xmath94    where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the morphism defined as    @xmath97    similarly , a tag system can be defined for the rest of the proper hilbert curves as    @xmath98    and for the improper hilbert curves    @xmath99    where    @xmath100    and the bar over the symbol represents the reversion operation .",
    "hilbert curves have proven to be useful constructions for a number of applications .",
    "it is often assumed , that there is exclusively one hilbert curve in 2d , but this is not the case .",
    "there has been reports for five alternative patterns to which , in this contributions , six more patterns have been added by introducing the reversion operation .",
    "the twelve patterns discussed in this paper have been called homogenous , to point out , that only one set of rules are applied to the @xmath3-order hilbert curve , in order to generate the @xmath101-order curve .",
    "all possible homogenous hilbert curves in 2d have been exhausted .",
    "is possible to construct additional hilbert curves , by combining different set of rules at each quadrant ( inhomogeneous curves ) which will be subject of a future article .",
    "the set of hilbert curves here described , gives a larger flexibility in choosing the adequate scan pattern for each application .",
    "for example , close curves are useful in a path searching heuristic for the traveling salesman problem based on space filling curves .",
    "other applications may benefit from curves that start and ends at opposite edges . without regard of their possible use",
    ", the patterns which are here reported , can have different symmetries and structural features , which make each them interesting in their own right .",
