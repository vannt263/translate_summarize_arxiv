    "the multiferroic materials , which simultaneously exhibit a long - range magnetic order and a spontaneous electric polarization , have attracted a great deal of attention due to their potential applications in the next - generation electronic devises as well as the fundamental interest in the origin of magnetoelectric ( me ) coupling.@xcite among them , there is a very important subclass of materials , which are called `` improper multiferroics '' , where the magnetic order does not simply coexist with the spontaneous polarization , but breaks the inversion symmetry by itself and , thus , becomes primarily responsible for the ferroelectric ( fe ) activity . because of this intrinsic interconnection between polarization and magnetism ,",
    "such materials are expected to exhibit a strong me coupling .",
    "there is a large number of theoretical studies , which introduce and emphasize the importance of different mechanisms of the me coupling , associated with the spin current;@xcite nonrelativistic magnetostriction;@xcite inverse dzyalishinskii - moriya ( dm ) mechanism , which is another type of magnetostriction , caused by the relativistic spin - orbit ( so ) coupling;@xcite and spin - dependent @xmath6-@xmath7 hybridization.@xcite currently , most of these theories have a phenomenological status , as each of them is typically oriented on the description of properties , observed in some narrow group of materials . presumably , the most striking example is the properties of orthorhombic manganites , which are typically interpreted from two completely different standpoints : the fe activity in the twofold periodic systems ( such as homno@xmath3 and ymno@xmath3 ) is ascribed solely to the nonrelativistic magnetostriction mechanism , whereas in materials with longer magnetic periodicity ( such as tbmno@xmath3 ) it is believed to have a purely relativistic origin , associated with either the spin current or the inverse dm mechanism .    in this work",
    "we continue to develop the double exchange ( de ) theory of the me coupling,@xcite which is oriented on the wide class of multiferroic manganites with different types of the crystallographic and magnetic structure .",
    "manganites play one of the key roles in the materials science engineering of novel multiferroic compounds .",
    "there are two reasons for it : ( i ) the orbital ordering , which , in the combination with other factors , assists the antisymmetric charge transfer and the formation of the spontaneous polarization;@xcite ( ii ) the high spin state of the mn@xmath8 ions , which is driven by intraatomic hund s coupling and plays a crucial role in the magnetic inversion symmetry breaking : since the nonmagnetic state of the mn@xmath8 sites would lead to a gigantic loss of the intraatomic hund s energy , in certain magnetic structures with competing magnetic interactions , it is more favorable energetically to keep these sites magnetic , but to abandon the inversion symmetry.@xcite    the basic electronic and magnetic properties of manganites are described by the de model.@xcite although the concept of the double exchange was originally introduced for the analysis of the metallic state , realized in hole - doped manganites , today it is understood much more generally  as a generic property of high spin compounds with the partially filled majority - spin states . from a mathematical point of view , the ` high spin state ' means that the intraatomic exchange splitting between the majority- and minority - spin states is so large that the effect of the latter states on the considered properties can be neglected .    the reorientation of spins in the de model may lead to a dramatic change of the electronic structure and even open the band gap.@xcite therefore , in order to understand the behavior of the fe polarization in the de model , it is very important to link it to the change of the electronic structure .",
    "this can be achieved by using the berry phase theory of polarization , which can be reformulated in terms of the occupied wannier functions in the real space.@xcite for compounds with the centrosymmetric crystal structure , such procedure naturally gives us the electronic polarization , induced by a noncentrosymmetric magnetic order .",
    "hopefully , the electronic structure of insulating manganites is characterized by another large parameter @xmath9 , which is the splitting between the occupied and unoccupied states with the same spin .",
    "it is caused by the jahn - teller distortion and additionally enhanced by the screened on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "this enables us to use the perturbation theory in order to evaluate the asymmetric spin - dependent change of the wannier functions in the first order of @xmath10.@xcite this change will automatically gives the spin dependence of the electronic polarization .",
    "needless to say that this mechanism of the me coupling is essentially nonrelativistic one : the relativistic spin - orbit interaction can play an important role in stabilizing noncentrosymmetric magnetic structures .",
    "however , once it is known , the fe polarization can be described by the nonrelativistic de theory .",
    "therefore , depending on the type of the magnetic structure , this mechanism can produce a large fe polarization .    in any model analysis , in order to describe the properties of realistic materials and to elucidate the differences between these materials",
    ", it is very important to make a link to the first - principles calculations . in our case",
    "all parameters of the de model are derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations , by constructing some effective hamiltonians for the magnetically active states in the basis of wannier functions.@xcite such a procedure typically gives us very reliable description of multiferroic and other properties of transition - metal oxides at a semi - quantitative level.@xcite    in our previous work ( ref .  ) , we have applied such de model for the analysis of ferroelectric ( fe ) activity in one particular type of manganites , crystallizing in the orthorhombic structure and forming twofold periodic magnetic structure in the ground state .",
    "we have argued that by using the de model one can indeed successfully rationalize many aspects of the fe activity in this type of systems . moreover , even at a quantitative level , it reproduces results of more general mean - field hartree - fock calculations for the effective model , which were used as the starting point for the construction of the de model .",
    "these results are also in a good agreement with available first - principles electronic structure calculations.@xcite    in this work we will systematically apply the de model for the analysis of the wide class of multiferroic manganites .",
    "we will show that the double exchange is indeed the key microscopic mechanism , which explains the basic aspects of the fe activity , related to the interplay between magnetic and crystallographic symmetries in various types of manganites .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we will introduce the de model of the me coupling in multiferroic manganites . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we will discuss applications of this model for different types of manganites .",
    "particularly , we will consider the orthorhombic systems ( the space group @xmath11 ) , forming twofold and fourfold periodic magnetic structures in the ground state ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : ortho ] ) , the monoclinic @xmath12 phase of bimno@xmath3 ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : bimno3 ] ) , and hexagonal manganites , crystallizing in the @xmath13 structure , using ymno@xmath3 as an example ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : hexo ] ) . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] , we will present a summary of our work .",
    "our strategy consists of the following steps :    \\(i ) we assume that fe and magnetic properties in the ground state of considered systems can be described reasonably well at the level of the mean - field theories",
    ". it can be the kohn - sham density functional theory or its refinements,@xcite which are widely used in the first - principles electronic structure calculations . in our case",
    ", we focus on the behavior of magnetically active @xmath0 bands of manganites and replace the first - principles calculations for this part by the solution of the realistic hubbard - type model , which was rigorously constructed using the technique of wannier functions.@xcite more specifically , we start with the electronic band structure in the local - density approximation ( lda ) , construct the wannier functions for the @xmath0 bands , and calculate the matrix elements of the lda hamiltonian in the basis of these wannier functions . such a construction gives us the proper one - electron part of the model hamiltonian .",
    "then , we calculate the screened on - site coulomb interactions for the @xmath0 bands , using the simplified version of the constrained random - phase approximation,@xcite as explained in ref .  .",
    "after that , we solve the effective hubbard - type model in the mean - field hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation .",
    "the solution gives us the mean - field hamiltonian of the form : @xmath14 here , @xmath15 $ ] is the proper one - electron part of the hubbard model between sites @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the basis of wannier orbitals @xmath18 (",
    "@xmath19 ) @xmath20 @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27@xmath24@xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the self - consistent hf potential at the site @xmath16 , which is constructed from the screened coulomb interactions and the density matrix.@xcite the wannier functions themselves were constructed using the projector - operator technique ( refs .   and ) and the orthonormal linear muffin - tin orbitals ( lmto ) ( ref .  ) as the trial wave functions .",
    "as the lmto basis is already well localized , such procedure allows us to generate well localized wannier functions .",
    "therefore , the obtained transfer integrals ( @xmath30 for @xmath31 ) are typically restricted by the nearest neighbors , while other contributions are substantially smaller .",
    "since the lda band structure is nonmagnetic and we do not consider explicitly the so coupling , the matrix @xmath32 does not depend on the spin indices ( @xmath33 and @xmath34@xmath20 @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) . without so interaction ,",
    "@xmath29 is diagonal with respect to @xmath33 and @xmath34:@xmath37 where each @xmath38 is the @xmath39@xmath40@xmath39 matrix in the orbital subspace .",
    "\\(ii ) we assume that , to a good approximation , @xmath41 can be replaced by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the averaged exchange splitting between the majority- and minority - spin states . due to hund s interactions ,",
    "the splitting @xmath43 is large in manganites .",
    "therefore , the details of @xmath41 in the unoccupied part of the spectrum becomes relatively unimportant on the energy scale of @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , one can consider the limit @xmath44 , and replace @xmath45 by the de hamiltonian:@xcite @xmath46 which operates in the subspace of @xmath35-spin states , in the local coordinate frame , specified by the directions of spins @xmath47 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : de ] ) is given by the well known expression:@xcite @xmath49    \\(iii ) the next step is the calculation of the electronic polarization using the berry - phase method.@xcite for our purpose , it is convenient to use the real - space formulation of this method , in terms of the occupied wannier functions @xmath50 .",
    "then , the electronic polarization is given by : @xmath51 where @xmath24@xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is the electron charge , @xmath54 is the volume of _ magnetic _ unit cell ( with @xmath55 being the volume of the crystallographic cell and @xmath56 being the number of such cells ) , and the summation @xmath57 runs over the occupied bands .",
    "alternatively , one can sum up unoccupied bands .",
    "this should give us @xmath58 .",
    "it is important to note that we treat @xmath1 as a nonrelativistic quantity , which does not explicitly depend on the so coupling .",
    "nevertheless , the latter can still define the directions @xmath59 of spins in the ground state .",
    "the spin dependence of @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pw ] ) is accumulated in @xmath60 .",
    "then , for each @xmath57 , one can arbitrarily shift the origin of integration in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pw ] ) .",
    "since each @xmath60 is normalized , the shifted integral and the original one will differ by some vector , which depends on the shift , but does not depend on the spin variables .",
    "therefore , since we are interested only in the spin dependence of @xmath1 , we shift the origin of each integral in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pw ] ) to the position of that atomic site for which @xmath50 was constructed and drop all concomitant terms , which do not depend on the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "\\(iv ) our next observation is that many manganites exhibit the jahn - teller distortion , which splits the occupied and unoccupied @xmath61 orbitals .",
    "this splitting is additionally enhanced by the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "thus , there is another large parameter @xmath9 , which characterizes the electronic structure of manganites .",
    "we will define it as the intraatomic energy splitting between the center of gravity of occupied manifold , consisting of three @xmath62 and one @xmath61 levels , and the unoccupied @xmath61 level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : idea ] ) .",
    "( color online ) schematic view , explaining the de model for fe polarization in manganites : due to specific magnetic alignment , the spins can form different angles in the bonds lying on the right ( @xmath63 ) and on the left ( @xmath64 ) relative to some center site . in the de model ,",
    "this leads to different scaling of the transfer integrals operating in these two bonds , which is described by the factors @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "even if the central site is located in the inversion center , this magnetic alignment breaks the inversion symmetry . using the berry phase theory,@xcite",
    "the polarization can be related to the spin - dependent asymmetric transfer of the weights of the occupied wannier functions to the neighboring sites , which are given by transfer integrals between occupied and unoccupied orbitals ( shown by dashed arrows ) . since the unoccupied @xmath61 orbital splits off from the occupied ones by large crystal field and the coulomb repulsion ( the corresponding splitting is denoted by @xmath9 )",
    ", these transfer integrals can be treated as a perturbation in the leading order of @xmath10.,height=226 ]    the large @xmath9 allows us to use the perturbation theory for the occupied wannier functions @xmath50 and evaluate their change in the first order of @xmath10 .",
    "practically , @xmath9 is obtained form the diagonalization of the site - diagonal part @xmath67 of the de hamiltonian ( [ eqn : de ] ) , which specifies the so - called crystal - field representation ( if there are two types of mn sites , like in bimno@xmath3 , we use the averaged value of @xmath9 ) .",
    "note that the occupied states in manganites are typically not well separated from each other and form one broad band . from this point of view , when we consider the energy splitting , it is more reasonable to use only one energy for all occupied states and take it in the center of gravity of these states .",
    "the transfer integrals can be also transformed to the crystal - field representation : @xmath68 .",
    "then , one can start with the atomic limit , where all @xmath50 are fully localized on their atomic sites , and consider the transfer of weight of @xmath50 to the neighboring sites in the first order of @xmath69 . since the transfers within occupied states correspond to some unitary transformation of @xmath50 , they will not change the physical properties .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to consider only the transfer integrals , connecting the occupied and unoccupied orbitals in the crystal - field representation . as was pointed out above , alternatively",
    ", one can consider the change of the unoccupied states and the transfer integrals from the unoccupied to occupied orbitals , which is more convenient for our purposes .",
    "since , at each mn site , there is only one unoccupied orbital , one can drop the index @xmath57 in the notations of @xmath50 and replace it by the site index @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we adopt the lattice model and assume that all weights of @xmath70 are localized in the lattice points : i.e. , if @xmath71 is centered at the site @xmath16 , its weight can be presented in the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the position of the site @xmath17 relative to the site @xmath16 .",
    "then , in the atomic limit , the weight is accumulated at the central site ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively ) .",
    "then , the weights at the neighboring sites can be obtained in the first order of the perturbation theory for @xmath71 as @xmath78 where the summation runs over four occupied orbitals . since @xmath79 , the weights @xmath80 and @xmath81 can be obtained from the same matrix of transfer integrals .",
    "\\(v ) finally , in the de model , the transfer integrals @xmath82 should be additionally modulated by @xmath48 , which depends on the relative orientation of spins at the sites @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "thus , even though the crystal structure itself is centrosymmetric and the mn sites are located in the inversion centers ( like in orthorhombic manganites , crystallizing in the @xmath11 structure ) , the multipliers @xmath48 can make some bonds , connecting the central mn site with its neighbors , inequivalent .",
    "for example , if the right bond @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ fig : idea ] is transformed to the left bond @xmath84 by the inversion operation , the spin alignment yielding @xmath85 will make these bonds inequivalent .",
    "this will break the inversion symmetry and produce some ` dipole ' , associated with the site @xmath16 , which will contribute to the electronic polarization as @xmath86 ( note that the sign was changed because here we consider the change of the _ unoccupied _ band and the electron transfer from the _ unoccupied _ @xmath61 orbital @xmath39 to the occupied orbitals @xmath87-@xmath88 ) .    in order to obtain the total polarization , one should sum up all inequivalent dipoles , induced by the magnetic symmetry breaking . moreover , it is straightforward to show that @xmath89 therefore , the spin dependence of @xmath90 in the de model is given by the isotropic correlation functions , @xmath2 , between directions of spins .",
    "this behavior should also specify the temperature dependence of the polarization , associated with the spin disorder .",
    "the spin dependence of @xmath1 has the same form as for the phenomenological magnetostriction mechanism,@xcite which is frequently used for the analysis of magnetoelectric ( me ) coupling in manganites.@xcite nevertheless , the new point of our analysis is that this dependence is natural result of the de physics and is not necessary related to the magnetically driven fe displacements .",
    "formally speaking , the proposed de mechanism can take place even in a centrosymmetric crystal structure without any magnetostriction , although these two effects can coexist : once the inversion symmetry is broken by the magnetic order , there will be magnetostrictive forces , which will move the atoms away from their centrosymmetric positions .",
    "this will activate the magnetostriction mechanism . in terms of the modern berry phase theory of polarization,@xcite",
    "one can say that the de and magnetostriction mechanism give rise to , respectively , electronic and ionic parts of the polarization .",
    "according to the first - principles calculations , the electronic contribution in manganites is at least equally important as the ionic one and can not be neglected.@xcite    by summarizing this section : in the de model , the inversion symmetry is broken by noncentrosymmetric modulation of the transfer integrals by @xmath48 .",
    "however , this modulation will also interplay with the crystallographic symmetry of manganites , which is reflected in the behavior of @xmath91 and @xmath82 .",
    "in the next section , we will illustrate how this interplay will work for different types of manganites , giving rise to finite me coupling .",
    "the connection between fe polarization and magnetic structure of orthorhombic ( @xmath11 ) manganites was discussed in our previous article ( ref .  ) , also on the level of the de model . in this section",
    "we present a more general and more comprehensive analysis of the problem .",
    "we assume that the manganites form the perfect antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order along the orthorhombic @xmath5 axis , that is indeed consistent with the experimental data.@xcite then , in the de model , all @xmath92 planes become effectively decoupled , and it is sufficient to consider the single plane .",
    "moreover , it is assumed that the magnetic structure is periodic along the @xmath93 axis and may have arbitrary periodicity along the @xmath4 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : orthoschem ] ) , being again in total agreement with the experimental situation.@xcite    ( color online ) schematic view on the crystal and magnetic structures in the @xmath92 plane of orthorhombic manganites .",
    "mn atoms are indicated by circles .",
    "two types of bonds , which are transformed to themselves by the symmetry operation @xmath94@xmath95@xmath96 , are shown by solid and broken lines .",
    "the magnetic structure is periodic along the orthorhombic @xmath93 axis and may have arbitrary periodicity along the @xmath4 axis.,height=226 ]    the most known examples are the twofold periodic e - type afm structure , realized in homno@xmath3 and ymno@xmath3,@xcite and the nearly fourfold periodic `` spiral '' magnetic structure , realized in tbmno@xmath3.@xcite however , it was also suggested that both types of magnetic structures are deformed by relativistic interactions and this deformation has a profound effect on the value of the fe polarization.@xcite    the crystal structure in the @xmath92 plane can be generated by two symmetry operation : @xmath94@xmath95@xmath96 ( the @xmath97 rotation around the orthorhombic @xmath93 axis , combined with the translation by @xmath98@xmath95@xmath99 ) and the inversion @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , the mn sites are located in the inversion centers .    then , we take an arbitrary mn site ( ` 0 ' in fig .  [",
    "fig : orthoschem ] ) and evaluate its contribution to the fe polarization , using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ppt ] ) . in this case",
    ", we should sum up the contributions of four bonds : @xmath75-@xmath87 , @xmath75-@xmath101 , @xmath75-@xmath102 , and @xmath75-@xmath103 , which correspond to @xmath104 @xmath98@xmath95@xmath99 , @xmath24@xmath98@xmath95@xmath99 , @xmath24@xmath98@xmath24@xmath99 , and @xmath98@xmath24@xmath99 , respectively .",
    "the inversion @xmath100 transforms the bonds @xmath75-@xmath102 and @xmath75-@xmath103 to the bonds @xmath75-@xmath87 and @xmath75-@xmath101 , respectively , and the symmetry operation @xmath94@xmath95@xmath96 transforms the bond @xmath75-@xmath101 to the bond @xmath87-@xmath75 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "moreover , the periodicity of the magnetic structure along @xmath93 imposes the following constraints : @xmath108 and @xmath109 , where the notations @xmath110 and @xmath111 stand for the bonds spreading in the positive and negative directions of the @xmath4 axis , starting from the site @xmath75 .",
    "then , the vector @xmath112 can be presented in the form : @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the fe polarization of the e - type afm phase ( @xmath115),@xcite @xmath116 since all mn sites are located strictly in the @xmath92 plane and , in the de model , all transfer integrals to the neighboring planes are suppressed by the afm order , there will be no polarization parallel to the orthorhombic @xmath5 axis .",
    "then , we can repeat this procedure and evaluate the contributions associated with the neighboring sites @xmath87 and @xmath103 in the magnetic cell ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : orthoschem ] ) .",
    "clearly , half of these contributions will involve the same bonds @xmath75-@xmath87 , @xmath75-@xmath101 , @xmath75-@xmath102 , and @xmath75-@xmath103 .",
    "moreover , since the sites @xmath87 and @xmath103 are obtained from the site @xmath75 by the symmetry operation @xmath94@xmath95@xmath96 , in the corresponding expressions for @xmath117 and @xmath118 we will have to interchange @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "furthermore , we note that @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    ". then , one can see that @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , all such contributions will be canceled out . on the other hand",
    ", the contributions parallel to @xmath93 will satisfy the condition @xmath124@xmath125 .",
    "these contributions can be regrouped so that the total polarization parallel to @xmath93 can be presented in the following form : @xmath126 where the summation runs over inequivalent sites of the magnetic unit cell ( note also that the crystallographic cell of orthorhombic manganites contains two mn sites in the @xmath92 plane ) .",
    "thus , the polarization will be parallel to the @xmath93 axis .",
    "similar result was obtained in our previous work,@xcite where we considered the magnetic structures , which respect the symmetry operation @xmath94@xmath95@xmath96 .",
    "the present work indicates that this result is more general and does not require any specific symmetry of the magnetic structure , apart from its periodicity along the @xmath93 axis and the afm coupling along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "another important point is that the fe polarization in all magnetic structures can be obtained by scaling the one in the e - type afm state .",
    "the scaling factor depends on the relative orientation of spins .",
    "below , we will study it more in details .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eqn : xiasee ] ) can be rewritten for our purposes as @xmath127 . by substituting it in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : portho1 ] ) and noting that only the direction - dependant part of @xmath128 will contribute to @xmath129 , one can find that @xmath130 this formula has the following consequences :    \\(i ) in the perfect e - type afm structure , @xmath131 is equal to @xmath95@xmath87 and @xmath24@xmath87 for the even and odd @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "however , in the latter case , the minus sign will be additionally changed due to the prefactor @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , all terms in the sum will be equal to @xmath87 and we will indeed obtain that @xmath133 .    one can also consider the deformation of the e - type afm state , where the odd sublattice is additionally rotated relative to the even one by the angle @xmath134 ( see , e.g. , fig .  3 of ref .  ) .",
    "such a deformation is caused by the so interaction and was obtained in the hf calculations for the realistic hubbard - type model.@xcite in this case , we have @xmath135 and , therefore , @xmath136 thus , for small @xmath134 , the first correction to @xmath137 appears only in the second order of @xmath134 .",
    "this explains that the fe polarization in the e - phase is relatively robust against the small canting of spins .",
    "however , @xmath129 vanishes in the spin - spiral state , corresponding to @xmath138 .",
    "\\(ii ) the previous claim appears to be more general and can be reformulated as follows : any homogeneous arrangement of spins , which is characterized by the same values of @xmath131 for all bonds in the @xmath92 plane , does not break the inversion symmetry .",
    "all these states have zero electric polarization , that directly follows from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : portho2 ] ) .",
    "such a situation is realized , for instance , in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state or in the _ homogeneous spin - spiral state _",
    ", despite a widespread believe.@xcite therefore , in order to obtain the finite polarization , it is essential to _ deform the spin spiral_. let us consider such a deformed spin - spiral structure in the @xmath92 plane , for which @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "namely , the phase @xmath141 describes the propagation of the homogeneous spin spiral and the small parameters @xmath142 , satisfying the condition @xmath143 , describe its deformation .",
    "the general geometry of the magnetic structure implies that @xmath144 and @xmath145 , where @xmath57 is an integer .",
    "then , since @xmath146@xmath24@xmath147 , we will have @xmath148 in the first order of @xmath149 , this expression can be further transformed to @xmath150 thus , the spin - spiral inhomogeneity contributes to @xmath129 in the first order of @xmath151 .",
    "if the phases @xmath151 are small , the corresponding polarization is also expected to be small .",
    "\\(iii ) eq .  ( [ eqn : pe ] ) clearly shows the similarities and differences between the fe polarization and interatomic superexchange interactions . indeed ,",
    "the expression @xmath152 is nothing but the ( minus ) energy gain caused by the fm alignment of spins in the bond @xmath75-@xmath87 , which contributes to the superexchange interaction.@xcite thus , this superexchange interaction is given by the same parameters @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the basic difference is that the superexchange interaction is given by the symmetric part of @xmath153 and @xmath154 , while the polarization depends on the antisymmetric part .",
    "below , we present some numerical estimates , using results of previous calculations for the magnetic ground state and fe polarization of orthorhombic manganites.@xcite namely , we take the magnetic structures , obtained in the unrestricted hf calculations with the so coupling , and analyze the behavior of the fe polarization in terms of the simplified expressions ( [ eqn : p2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : p4 ] ) , obtained in the de model for the deformed magnetic structures of the afm e - type and spin - spiral type , respectively .",
    "in the hf calculations , we typically obtain two types of magnetic structures with the twofold ( @xmath155 ) and fourfold ( @xmath156 ) periodicity .",

    "4 of ref .  ) .",
    "as was explained above , the twofold periodic structure can be viewed as the deformed e - type afm state .",
    "the deformation is caused by the single - ion anisotropy .",
    "for the @xmath11 phases , the angle @xmath134 , characterizing this deformation , varies from @xmath158 , in the case of tbmno@xmath3,@xcite till @xmath159 in the case of ymno@xmath3 and homno@xmath3 ( ref .   and fig .",
    "[ fig : homno3 ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath129 can be estimated using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : p2 ] ) as @xmath160 , which is perfectly consistent with results of the hf calculations",
    ". indeed , the values of @xmath137 , obtained in the hf calculations for the collinear e - type afm phase without the so coupling , are @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 @xmath164c/@xmath165 for tbmno@xmath3 , homno@xmath3 , and ymno@xmath3 , respectively . the same calculations , but with the so coupling , yield @xmath166 @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 @xmath164c/@xmath165 for tbmno@xmath3 , homno@xmath3 , and ymno@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "thus , in all three examples , the above relationship @xmath160 works very well and this tendency is nicely explained by the de model , where the so interaction is used in order to obtain the direction of spins in the ground state , while the fe polarization is calculated as a nonrelativistic quantity for the given distribution of spins .",
    "similar analysis can be done for the fourfold periodic structure , which can be viewed as a deformed spin spiral , propagating along the @xmath4 axis . in this case , the spin spiral is stabilized by isotropic magnetic interactions and deformed by anisotropic and dm interactions.@xcite first , we take the angles @xmath170 , characterizing the directions of spins in the actual hf calculations with the so coupling ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : homno3 ] ) , and decompose them into the homogeneous ( @xmath141 ) and inhomogeneous ( @xmath142 ) parts .",
    "then , @xmath171 is the averaged value of @xmath172@xmath24@xmath173 in the magnetic supercell and @xmath174@xmath24@xmath175@xmath24@xmath176 .",
    "for all three compounds , we obtain @xmath177 ( in units of reciprocal lattice translation @xmath178 ) , which is close to the equilibrium values @xmath179 , obtained in the spin - spiral calculations without the so coupling.@xcite the parameters @xmath174@xmath24@xmath180 , characterizing the deformation of the spin spiral , are summarized in table  [ tab : spiral ] .",
    ".parameters @xmath181@xmath24@xmath142 , characterizing deformation of the spin - spiral state ( in degrees ) , as obtained in the unrestricted hartree - fock calculations with the spin - orbit coupling for the @xmath11 phase of tbmno@xmath3 , homno@xmath3 , and ymno@xmath3 .",
    "the atomic positions are explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : homno3 ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     using these parameters , the nearest - neighbor contribution to @xmath182 ( parallel yo @xmath183 ) can be estimated as @xmath24@xmath88 @xmath164c / m@xmath184 , which is small due to the strong cancelation between two inequivalent types of bonds .",
    "the contribution of next - nearest neighbors is @xmath24@xmath185 @xmath164c / m@xmath184 , which is consistent with the value @xmath24@xmath186 @xmath164c / m@xmath184 , obtained in the hf calculations without additional approximations.@xcite thus , the value of @xmath182 is mainly determined by the wannier transfer between next - nearest neighbors in adjacent plane .",
    "this is consistent with other magnetic properties of hexagonal manganites .",
    "for instance , the type of the magnetic coupling between the planes is also controlled by the nnn interactions , while the contribution of the nearest neighbors is small or can be of the opposite sign.@xcite",
    "in this work , we extend the de theory of the me coupling and systematically apply it to the wide class of multiferroic manganites , exhibiting different crystallographic and magnetic structures . for all considered materials , we are able to present a transparent physical picture of how the fe polarization is induced and controlled by the magnetic order .",
    "this picture is based on the de theory , which was formulated for the effective low - energy model , derived from the first - principles calculations .",
    "our basic idea is that for the analysis of electronic properties of manganites one can use two physical limits .",
    "the first one is the de limit , which means that the intraatomic exchange splitting between the majority- and minority - spin states , driven by hund s interactions , is so large that the contribution of the latter states to the electronic polarization can be neglected .",
    "the second one is the limit of large intraatomic splitting @xmath9 between the occupied and unoccupied orbitals with the majority spin , which is driven by the jahn - teller distortion and the screened on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "the second limit allows us to use the perturbation theory for the occupied wannier functions in the first order of @xmath10 , which can be incorporated in the general berry - phase theory of polarization .",
    "thus , the electronic polarization can be described in term of the asymmetric transfer of the weights of the wannier functions to the neighboring sites , which , in the de model , are additionally modulated by the spin - dependent factors .",
    "the de model allows to greatly simplify the analysis of the polarization and present it in the transparent form , explaining the interplay between the crystallographic and magnetic structures .",
    "moreover , it provides the simple analytical dependence of the fe polarization on the relative directions of spins .",
    "as expected for the nonrelativistic theory of the fe polarization , this dependence is given by the ` isotropic correlators ' @xmath2 .",
    "it has the same form as for the phenomenological magnetostriction mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , this is a new mechanism , which is not directly related to the magnetostriction and can take place without magnetostriction , even in a centrosymmetric crystal structure .",
    "first , we have systematically applied the de theory to the orthorhombic @xmath11 manganites and generalized results of our previous work ( ref .  ) .",
    "our present result is valid for any noncollinear magnetic structure , of an arbitrary periodicity , propagating along the orthorhombic @xmath4 axis and antiferromagnetically coupled along the @xmath5 axis . for this type of magnetic structures ,",
    "we have argued that the fe polarization should be parallel to the orthorhombic @xmath93 axis and can be obtained by scaling the one of the collinear e - type afm state with the scaling factor depending exclusively on the relative direction of spins .",
    "the fe polarization vanishes in the homogeneous spin - spiral state , which preserves the inversion symmetry of the de hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , the only possibility to obtain the finite polarization is to deform the homogeneous spin spiral and to produce some inhomogeneity in the distribution of spins . in multiferroic manganites ,",
    "such a deformation is caused by the relativistic so interaction .",
    "this picture works equally well for manganites with the twofold and fourfold periodic magnetic structures , which typically attributed to homno@xmath3 and tbmno@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the basic difference is that , even despite some spin canting and deviation from the collinear e - type afm alignment , the twofold periodic magnetic structure remains strongly inhomogeneous , that leads to the large polarization . on the contrary",
    ", the fourfold periodic magnetic structure can be viewed as a distorted homogenous spin spiral . therefore , if the distortion is small , the polarization is also small .",
    "next , we have studied the microscopic origin of the fe polarization , caused by the magnetic inversion symmetry breaking in the @xmath12 phase of bimno@xmath187 .",
    "the uniqueness of this situation is that the magnetic ground state of bimno@xmath3 contains both afm @xmath188 component , which breaks the inversion symmetry , and the fm magnetization , caused by the canting of spins .",
    "thus , this is a rare case , where the fe polarization indeed coexists with the fm magnetization , that is very important from the viewpoint of the mutual control of ferroelectricity and magnetism . according to the mean - field hf calculations ,",
    "the afm magnetization lies in the monoclinic @xmath26 plane , while the fm one is parallel to the @xmath189 axis.@xcite we have modeled this magnetic structure in our de analysis in order to find a quantitative relationship between the fm magnetization and the fe polarization .",
    "as expected , these two quantities ` anticorrelate ' with each other : by enforcing the fm magnetization , one can decreases the polarization .",
    "the latter can be obtained by scaling the one of the collinear @xmath188 afm state .",
    "the scaling factor is given again by the correlation function between directions of neighboring spins , but since the fm moments do not contribute to the polarization , this correlation function includes only afm components of the magnetization .",
    "the polarization in this case lies in the @xmath26 plane ( so as the afm magnetization ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath190 component of the polarization is substantially larger than the @xmath183 one .",
    "we have found this behavior to be closely related to the orbital ordering , realized in bimno@xmath187 : while the @xmath190 component is very robust and can be expected even in the perfect cubic lattice ( provided that it supports the particular type of the orbital ordering , realized in bimno@xmath3 ) , the weak @xmath183 component is the measure of deviation from the perfect cubic environment , which crucially depends on the details of the monoclinic distortion .    finally , we have explained the origin of the me coupling , associated with the reversal of spins in every second @xmath21 plane of hexagonal manganites .",
    "such a reversal can be indeed expected in realistic materials if one can induce the change of the magnetic structure from @xmath191 to @xmath192 ( or between any two types of the magnetic structures , in which the magnetic moments in the neighboring planes are transformed , respectively , by the native symmetry operations of the @xmath193 space group and by the same symmetry operations , combined with the time reversal ) .",
    "although the @xmath193 space group has no inversion symmetry and , therefore , the system is expected to be ferroelectric , irrespectively on the magnetic order , this change of the magnetic structure produced a finite change of the fe polarization .",
    "we have derived an analytical expression for the spin - dependent part of the polarization and evaluated different contributions to it , associated with the transfer of the weights of the wannier functions to different groups of sites in the adjacent planes .",
    "we have found that the main contribution comes from next - nearest neighbors , while the ones from the nearest sites are small due to the strong cancelation , which occurs between two inequivalent types of bonds .    in conclusion ,",
    "the de mechanism of the me coupling plays a very important role in physics of multiferroic manganites and explains many basics aspects of the fe activity in these systems on a unified ground .",
    "thus , this is the key microscopic mechanisms , which should be considered in the analysis of multiferroic properties of manganites and related compounds .",
