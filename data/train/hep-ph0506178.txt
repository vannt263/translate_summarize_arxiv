    "understanding the behavior of high energy hadron reactions from a fundamental perspective within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is an important goal of particle physics .",
    "attempts to test experimentally this sector of qcd have started some years ago with the first experimental results from lepton - hadron ( desy - hera ) and hadron - hadron ( fermilab - tevatron ) collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "the papers which form the core of our knowledge of the regge limit ( high energy limit ) of qcd were established in the late 1970s by lipatov and collaborators @xcite . the physical effect that they describe",
    "is often referred to as the qcd pomeron , with the evolution described by the bfkl equation .",
    "the simplest process where this equation applies is the high energy scattering between two heavy quark - antiquark states , _",
    "i.e. _ the onium - onium scattering . for a sufficiently heavy onium state ,",
    "high energy scattering is a perturbative process since the onium radius gives the essential scale at which the running coupling @xmath5 is evaluated .",
    "this process was proposed as a _",
    "experiment to investigate the high energy regime of qcd in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . at leading order ( lo )",
    ", the cross section grows rapidly with the energy , @xmath6 because the number of dipoles in the light cone wave function grows rapidly with the energy .",
    "some examples of processes which are directly related with the onium - onium scattering are forward jets in deeply inelastic events at low values of the bjorken variable @xmath7 in lepton - hadron scattering , jet production at large rapidity separations in hadron - hadron collisions and off - shell photon scattering at high energy in @xmath8 colliders , where the photons are produced from the leptons beams by bremsstrahlung ( for a review of bfkl searches , see e.g. ref .",
    "this last process presents some theoretical advantages as a probe of qcd pomeron dynamics compared to the other ones because it does not involve a non - perturbative target @xcite .",
    "in particular , the photon colliders offer unique possibility to probe qcd in its high energy limit @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the initial state and the possibility of study of many different combinations of final states making this process very useful for studying the qcd dynamics in the limit of high center - of - mass energy @xmath9 and fixed momentum transfer @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , if we consider quark production in @xmath10 collisions we have that in the general case there can be three large momentum scales in this process - the photon virtuality @xmath11 , the momentum transfer @xmath0 and the quark mass @xmath12 .",
    "it implies that for real photons interactions and @xmath13 only heavy quark production can be treated perturbatively . on the other hand",
    ", perturbation theory can be used even for light quark production if @xmath14 . in the last years",
    "many authors have studied in detail the heavy quark production in @xmath10 collisions considering different theoretical approaches @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "other possibility for the study of the qcd pomeron is the vector meson pairs production in @xmath10 collisions @xcite . at very high energies",
    "@xmath15 , diffractive processes such as @xmath16 neutral vector ( or pseudo - scalar ) meson pairs with virtual or real photons can test the qcd pomeron ( odderon ) in a detailed way utilizing the simplest possible initial state . as in the case of the large angle exclusive @xmath10 processes , the scattering amplitude is computed by convoluting the hard scattering pqcd amplitude for @xmath17 with the vector meson wave functions . for heavy vector mesons , this cross section can be calculated using the perturbative qcd methods .",
    "first calculations considering the born two - gluon approximation have been done in refs .",
    "some years ago , the double @xmath18 production in @xmath10 collisions has been proposed as a probe of the qcd pomeron @xcite , where the cross sections are calculated in the bfkl framework and also considering a next leading order ( nlo ) calculation by a kinematic veto on the gluon momenta in the ladder .",
    "non - perturbative contributions for this process are studied in @xcite by employing modified gluon propagators .",
    "theoretical estimates of the cross sections presented in @xcite have demonstrated that measurement of this reaction at a photon collider should be feasible ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "in order to calculate light vector meson production it is necessary to consider virtual photon collisions or a large momentum transfer . in this paper",
    "we study the double vector meson production in @xmath10 collisions , where the the color singlet @xmath0-channel exchange carries large momentum transfer .",
    "such processes are characterized by a large rapidity gap between the vector mesons , with it identified experimentally by their decay into charged particles , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath19 .",
    "the presence of a large momentum transfer allow us to calculate the light and heavy vector mesons production cross sections for real photon interactions .",
    "we consider the non - forward solution of the bfkl equation at high energy and large momentum transfer and estimate the total and differential cross section for the process @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be any two vector mesons ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "our study is motivated by the fact that the experimental data for the vector meson photo - production at high @xmath0 in electron - proton collisions at hera can be described quite well using the impact factor representation and the non - forward bfkl solution @xcite . in order to simplify our calculations",
    "we will consider the non - relativistic approximation in the calculations of the impact factors .",
    "this approximation should be not applicable for light mesons .",
    "however , as verified in ref .",
    "@xcite , the predictions obtained using the non - forward bfkl solution at asymptotic energies ( leading conformal spin solution ) and this approximation agree quite well with heavy and light meson hera data .",
    "this phenomenological success occurs due to the selection of the dominant amplitude of the general expression as demonstrated in ref .",
    "we will assume that this dominance will be also present in the processes considered in this paper , and use this approximation in that follows .",
    "we postponed for a future publication the study of double vector production using the full amplitude , similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite , which will allow us consider the helicity flip of the quarks .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we present a brief review of the formalism necessary in order to calculate the differential and total cross section of the @xmath1 process . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our predictions and compare our results with previous estimatives .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we present a summary of our main conclusions .",
    "in order to calculate the @xmath1 cross section we will consider the impact factor representation proposed by cheng and wu @xcite many years ago , which allow us factorize the process in three disjoint parts : the impact factors associated to the transitions @xmath20 and the exchange mechanism between them represented by @xmath21 in fig . [ fig1 ] . in this representation , the amplitude for the high energy process @xmath22 can be expressed on the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the impact factors for the upper and lower parts of the diagram , respectively .",
    "that is , they are the impact factors for the processes @xmath26 and @xmath27 with two gluons carrying transverse momenta @xmath28 and @xmath29 attached , the gluons being in an overall color singlet state . at lowest order the process",
    "is described by two gluon exchange , which implies @xmath30 and an energy independent cross section . at higher order ,",
    "the dominant contribution is given by the qcd pomeron singularity which is generated by the ladder diagrams with the ( reggeized ) gluon exchange along the ladder .",
    "the qcd pomeron is described by the bfkl equation @xcite , which implies that the exchange of the gluon ladder with interacting gluons generates increasing cross sections with the energy .",
    "as our goal is the analysis of double vector meson production at large - @xmath0 , we will use in our calculations the non - forward solution of the bfkl equation in the leading logarithmic approximation , obtained by lipatov in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the differential cross - section , characterized by the invariant collision energy squared @xmath31 , is expressed in terms of the amplitude @xmath32 as follows @xmath33 the amplitude is dominated by its imaginary part , which we shall parametrize , as in @xcite , by a dimensionless quantity @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are defined by @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mass of the vector meson , @xmath41 is the photon virtuality and @xmath42 is a characteristic scale related to @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in this paper",

    "( [ zdef ] ) ] .",
    "the first factor comes from the couplings of the two gluons to the impact factor and the second one is generated by the gluon coupling inside the gluon ladder ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we treat these strong couplings as being identical and assume a fixed @xmath5 , which is appropriate to the leading logarithmic accuracy . furthermore ,",
    "as the cross section is proportional to @xmath70 , our results are strongly dependent on the choice for the @xmath5 value .",
    "we assume @xmath71 , following refs .",
    "@xcite , where this value was determined from a fit to the hera data ( for a detailed discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . similarly , at leading logarithmic approximation , @xmath69 is arbitrary but must depend on the scale in the problem . in our case",
    "we have that in general @xmath69 will be a function of @xmath72 and/or @xmath0 . following ref .",
    "@xcite we will assume that @xmath69 can be expressed by @xmath73 , with @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in order to consider the possibility of the production of two different mesons",
    "we will generalize this expression for @xmath76 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we analyze the dependence of the differential cross section for @xmath77 production in our choice for the @xmath78 parameters .",
    "although we only present the results for @xmath10 collisions at @xmath79 gev , the dependence is similar for other center of mass energies . as @xmath69 is present in the definition of the variable @xmath36 [ eq .",
    "( [ zdef ] ) ] , which is associated with the energy dependence of the cross section , we have that a different prescription for @xmath69 basically modify the normalization of the differential cross section . in",
    "that follows we will assume @xmath80 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we present our results for the momentum transfer dependence of the differential cross sections for the production of different combinations of pairs of vector mesons and distinct values of energy . for comparison , the born level prediction which corresponds a two gluon exchange , given by the following formula",
    ", @xmath81 is also presented .",
    "we have that the differential cross sections decreases when the masses of the pair of mesons increases as well as it becomes flatter .",
    "another remarkable feature is the change of the behavior of the cross section when we take into account the bfkl machinery in comparison with the born level cross section .",
    "the bfkl dynamics implies a growth of the differential cross section and a different slope in comparison to born level , which is not modified when the energy increases . as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the inclusion of bfkl dynamics result in a steeper @xmath0-dependence than the born calculation .",

    "( [ sigtot ] ) and the results are displayed in the figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] and in the tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] . for light vector meson production ,",
    "a lower cut - off in the @xmath0-integration is necessary in order to minimize non - perturbative ( soft pomeron ) contributions .",
    "we choose in this case @xmath82 gev@xmath83 , which is reasonable considering that the hera data for the photoproduction of light vector mesons in this kinematic region are quite well described using a similar approach @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we assume @xmath84 when at least a heavy meson is produced , since in this case we have a hard scale present which justifies the perturbative calculations in the low-@xmath0 ( @xmath85 ) region .",

    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "we have that the total cross sections are smaller for heavier vector mesons .",
    "moreover , the introduction of a cut - off in the @xmath0-integration implies a reduction of the normalization of the total cross section , as expected from the analyses of the differential cross section .",
    "another important feature is that difference between the calculations assuming @xmath84 and @xmath82 gev@xmath83 is also smaller for heavier vector mesons . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we present our predictions for the production of two light vector mesons assuming @xmath82 gev@xmath83 .",

    "[ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] we present a comparison between our predictions for the total cross section for some values of center of mass energy and the energy independent prediction which comes from the born amplitude .",
    "we have that the inclusion of the bfkl dynamics implies that the cross sections strongly increases with the energy , resulting in an enhancement of the cross section in comparison with the born level prediction .",
    "this enhancement is larger when a heavy vector meson is produced and @xmath84 gev@xmath83 .",
    "if we assume @xmath82 gev@xmath83 the bfkl dynamics predicts a similar enhancement of the light and heavy vector meson cross sections .",
    "lets now compare our results with those obtained in other approaches @xcite ( for related discussions see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in ref . @xcite the felix collaboration has proposed the construction of a full acceptance detector for the lhc , with a primary proposal providing comprehensive observation of a very broad range of strong - interaction processes . in particular ,",
    "studies of two photon physics in @xmath88 collisions has been discussed in its proposal @xcite . there , the differential cross - section @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , was parameterized in the form @xmath91 this parameterization was obtained assuming the validity of the pomeron - exchange factorization at high energies @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) which relates the cross sections for different processes .",
    "the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 were fixed considering the data for vector meson photoproduction at hera and for @xmath94 elastic scattering . for the @xmath77 case , for instance , @xmath95 nb / gev@xmath96 , @xmath97 gev@xmath96 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we have assume this parameterization and calculated the total cross section considering @xmath84 and @xmath82 gev@xmath83 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . in comparison with the bfkl predictions we have that the felix parameterization implies a different normalization and energy dependence , with the bfkl one being steeper .",
    "basically , the felix parameterization overestimate the cross sections at low energies and underestimate the cross section at very high energies .",
    "the only exception occurs when we consider the double @xmath18 production . in this case",
    "the bfkl prediction is larger than the felix one for all energies if we assume @xmath100 nb / gev@xmath96 , @xmath101 gev@xmath96 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . on the other hand , if we assume @xmath104 nb / gev@xmath96 and @xmath105 as also proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( bfkl - fit ) we have that the felix parameterization implies a larger cross section for all energies .",
    "the main conclusion of the comparison between the bfkl predictions and those obtained assuming the pomeron - exchange factorization is that the bfkl dynamics implies a violation of this factorization , which could be tested in future colliders .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the double vector meson production in @xmath10 collisions has been analyzed using the stochastic vacuum model @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the assumption that the infrared behavior of qcd can be approximated by a gaussian stochastic process in the gluon field strength tensor .",
    "a shortcoming of this model is that the energy dependence is not predicted , which implies the introduction of a phenomenological ansatz for this dependence . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have considered the two - pomeron model @xcite , resulting that the scattering amplitude is given by the general expression @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "these values are used in order to describe the @xmath94 and @xmath109 data .",
    "it is important to emphasize that as this model includes soft and hard contributions the light and heavy vector meson total cross sections can be calculated assuming @xmath84 gev@xmath83 .",
    "consequently , its results for double light vector meson production can not be directly compared with our predictions . however , analyzing only the energy dependence of both predictions , we have that the bfkl dynamics implies a steeper dependence as expected , since the soft pomeron contribution dominates the cross sections for these processes in the model proposed in @xcite . on the other hand , when a heavy vector meson is present a comparison can be made . in this case",
    "the predictions agree for low values of energy ( @xmath110 gev ) but are distinct for larger energies due to the larger intercept resulting from the bfkl equation than the phenomenological one @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath77 production in @xmath10 processes has also been estimated in refs.@xcite .",

    ". in the small-@xmath0 approximation ,",
    "the slope is estimated to be @xmath115 gev@xmath96 .",
    "the light meson - photon coupling is denoted by @xmath116 .",
    "the process above was proposed as a probe of the gluon distribution on the meson @xmath117 and , by consequence , a constrain for the photon structure .",
    "the enhancement in the sensitivity by taking the square of those distributions in the total cross section could discriminate them in measurements at the future photon colliders .",
    "considering different models for the gluon distribution of the meson the total cross section was estimated as being almost 10 pb at @xmath110 gev and in the range between @xmath118 and @xmath119 pb at @xmath120 gev . our results agree with these predictions , with a behavior similar to those obtained using the grs(lo ) parameterization for the gluon distribution on the @xmath121 meson ( for details see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , in ref . @xcite the double @xmath121 production was estimated assuming the pomeron - exchange factorization to relate distinct cross sections , similarly to felix collaboration .",
    "our results agree with its results .",
    "however , as its predictions are strongly dependent on the assumptions present in the calculations of the double @xmath18 and @xmath77 production ( see table 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a direct comparison is not very illuminating .",
    "the first computations of the double vector meson production at arbitrary momentum transfer were done in refs .",
    "@xcite considering the born graph for the pomeron ( two - gluon exchange ) .",
    "the total cross section for double light meson production were computed assuming @xmath122 gev@xmath83 and @xmath123 .",

    "similarly to light vector meson production , our results agree with the predictions from @xcite if the differences are taken into account . in ref .",
    "@xcite the total cross section was estimated assuming a small-@xmath0 approximation and an ansatz for the @xmath124 slope parameter .",
    "moreover , it was calculated considering the solution of the forward bfkl solution and some of its next - to - leading corrections .",
    "the normalization of the cross section is strongly dependence of the @xmath5 value ( see table 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and its energy dependence is steeper when the leading order ( lo ) solution of the bfkl equation is used . basically , although the normalization of the distinct predictions differ , the energy dependence is very similar .",
    "the difference in the normalization can be explained in terms of the uncertainty introduced in the calculations by the small-@xmath0 approximation used in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if we compare our results with those obtained using the solution of the forward bfkl equation with a different intercept , we have that the normalization for low energies is similar , but the energy dependence of those predictions are softer .",
    "this result is expected , since the next - to - leading corrections for the bfkl equation implies a lower intercept than the leading order solution used in our calculations .",
    "finally , lets estimate the expected number of events of some of the processes calculated in this paper for the future linear colliders .",
    "currently , the international high energy physics ( hep ) community is considering the construction of a new @xmath125 collider @xcite . for @xmath10 collisions with center of mass energies equal to @xmath79 gev , luminosities of order @xmath126 , 0.2 and 4.0 @xmath127 are expected at tesla , clic and ilc , respectively .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the next generation of linear collider can reach values of center of mass energies up to 3000 gev . as the bfkl dynamics predicts a strong growth of the cross sections with the energy , the number of events presented in that follows",
    "may be considered a lower bound . in table [ tab3 ] we present our predictions for the number of events per second for the @xmath128 , @xmath77 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 production . for double @xmath121 production",
    "our estimate is conservative , since the soft pomeron contribution is not included in our calculations .",
    "we predict a large number of events related to double meson production in @xmath10 collisions , allowing future experimental analyses , even if the acceptance for vector meson detection were low .",
    "consequently , we believe that this process could be used to constrain the qcd dynamics at high energies .",
    "the photon colliders offer unique possibility to probe qcd in a new and hitherto unexplorated regime",
    ". moreover , good knowledge and understanding of two photon processes will be essential for controlling background contributions to other processes . in this paper",
    "we have studied the double vector meson production using the non - forward solution of the bfkl equation at high energy and large momentum transfer .",
    "the total and differential cross section for the process @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be any two vector mesons ( @xmath4 ) , were estimated and compared with those obtained using different approaches . in particular , we have verified that the pomeron - exchanged factorization leads to different predictions than those obtained in this paper .",
    "our main conclusion is that the forthcoming photon colliders could experimentally to check our predictions .",
    "we believe that this process could be used to constrain the qcd dynamics at high energies",
    ". however , several points deserves more detailed studies : the contribution of all conformal spins , the helicity flip of the quarks , the next - to - leading order corrections to the bfkl dynamics and the corrections associated to the saturation effects .",

    "<S> we consider the non - forward solution of the bfkl equation at high energy and large momentum transfer and estimate the total and differential cross section for the process @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be any two vector mesons ( @xmath4 ) . a comparison between our predictions and previous theoretical results obtained at born level or assuming the pomeron - exchange factorization relations is presented . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the bfkl dynamics implies an enhancement of the cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> predictions for the future linear colliders ( tesla , clic and ilc ) are given . </S>"
