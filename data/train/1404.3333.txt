    "two - dimensional planar systems of several coulomb charges of finite masses , both classical and quantum , exhibit many interesting properties which are usually either hidden or absent in three dimensional one .",
    "the situation gets even more interesting if a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane is imposed .",
    "the first non - trivial case of two coulomb charges reveals the existence of unexpected concentric classical trajectories and straight line motion ( for neutral systems ) ( see @xcite and references therein ) in classical problem . in the quantum case there",
    "exist a certain eigenstates which are characterized by extra quantum numbers .",
    "they are the eigenfunctions of the operators which are not global integrals @xcite . usually , these eigenfunctions are of polynomial form ( up to a multiplicative factor ) @xcite . in two important cases of quasi - equal charges @xmath3 and neutral system at rest the hidden algebra @xmath4 in finite - dimensional representation is present for a certain discrete values of a magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "it is needless to say that in the three - dimensional case there exists the phenomenon of dissociation which is absent in the two - dimensional planar case .",
    "all that indicates the absence of a trivial connection between two- and three - dimensional cases . however , it turns out that there exists a number of properties which are similar for two- and three - dimensional systems in a constant uniform magnetic field .",
    "this similarity will be mentioned in our presentation .    in our previous paper",
    "@xcite an accurate variational solution for several low - lying states for both quasi - equal charges @xmath3 and neutral system at rest was given .",
    "the stability of the system was shown for all magnetic fields .",
    "the accuracy of the obtained results was evaluated in a specially designed , convergent perturbation theory .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to perform the study of the ground state of a moving neutral system of two coulomb charges of finite masses in a wide range of magnetic fields and to check its stability .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the global integral of the motion , the pseudomomentum @xmath5 established by gorkov & dzyaloshinskii @xcite for the three - dimensional case remains the global integral for planar case as well , it coincides with the center - of - mass ( cms ) canonical momentum of the system , @xmath6 .",
    "we focus on a particular case of the hydrogen atom ( the case of unequal masses ) and we also mention positronium ( the case of equal masses ) . to the best knowledge of the present authors",
    "there was a single attempt so far to study the moving hydrogen atom on the plane carried out by lozovik _",
    "et al _ , @xcite .",
    "it was done for very weak magnetic fields .",
    "this problem is seen as an important for solid state physics , for the physics of excitons .",

    "the equation ( [ hka ] ) is the basic equation we are going to study . at @xmath46 ,",
    "the relative angular momentum @xmath47 is conserved , the relative polar angle @xmath48 is separated out and the problem ( [ hka ] ) is reduced to a study of dynamics in ( relative ) radial direction @xmath49 , thus , becomes effectively one - dimensional ( ! ) . in double polar coordinates cms @xmath50 and relative @xmath51 coordinate systems ( i ) the eigenfunctions are factorizable , all factors except for @xmath49-dependent are found analytically , they have definite relative angular momentum , ( ii ) dynamics in @xmath49-direction is described by a funnel - type potential and it is characterized by the hidden @xmath4 algebra ; ( iii ) at some discrete values of dimensionless magnetic fields @xmath52 the algebra @xmath4 emerges in finite - dimensional representation , thus , the system becomes _ quasi - exactly - solvable_. this case has been analyzed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , for the case of moving system @xmath53 , an immediate observation is that the relative angular momentum @xmath54 is not conserved .",
    "consequently , the relative coordinates are not separated and the system is not reduced to one - dimensional dynamics . neither factorization of eigenfunctions nor a hidden algebraic structure occurs .",
    "the problem is essentially two - dimensional and we arrive at the question how to solve it .",
    "a simple idea that we are going to employ is to combine a wkb expansion at large distances with perturbation theory near the minima of the potential into an interpolation .",
    "the main practical goal of this paper is to construct such an approximation for the ground state of the hydrogen atom and then use it as variational trial function .",
    "let us first consider the case of weak magnetic fields and small pseudomomentum . in this regime",
    "the interaction of particles with the magnetic field as well as magnetic field self - interaction can be treated as a perturbation of the hydrogen atom .",
    "we focus our analysis on the ground state only .",
    "the wave function depending on relative coordinate @xmath55 ( see ( [ psik ] ) ) can be represented in the form : @xmath56 we assume that the phase @xmath57 has no singularities on the real plane . substituting ( [ varpsi ] ) with cm momentum chosen to be directed along @xmath58-axis , thus , @xmath59 in polar coordinates , into the schrdinger equation ( [ hka ] ) we arrive at the riccati type equation @xmath60 with a non - trivial potential @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "now we develop a perturbation theory for @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xmath65 substituting ( [ pert ] ) into ( [ riccati0 ] ) , and collecting the terms of the order of @xmath66 , we obtain the following equation for corrections , thus , @xmath67 : @xmath68 where formally @xmath69 , here @xmath70 plays the role of an effective perturbation potential and is given by the following formulas : @xmath71 and for @xmath72 @xmath73 where the summation is performed such a way that @xmath74 and @xmath75 . the first corrections in ( [ pert ] ) can be calculated explicitly ( see table  [ zeeman2d ] for some concrete cases ) and the energy expansion has a form @xmath76 where we put @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the coefficient functions in the phase expansion ( [ pert ] ) are @xmath79    since in the potential ( 17 ) the magnetic field @xmath0 appears as a coefficients in front of the most singular term @xmath80 at large distances the dyson instability phenomenon occurs when @xmath81 is negative ( for discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , it is evident that this perturbation theory in powers of @xmath0 is divergent , there exists a singularity at @xmath82 . otherwise , for any fixed @xmath83 the dyson instability phenomenon does not occur when @xmath1 changes sign .",
    "it indicates that the series in @xmath1 has a finite radius of convergence , which is , of course , of the order of @xmath0 .",

    "it is located at @xmath106 ( which is charge independent ( ! ) , @xmath8 ) . for @xmath107 , the potential ( [ veff ] )",
    "has two minima ( see fig.[vb1 ] ) . for fixed @xmath0 in the limit @xmath108 we can easily obtain from ( [ vy ] )",

    "for @xmath119 the second minimum in @xmath97 ( [ veff ] ) does not exist and the potential possesses azimuthal symmetry . in this case , the symmetric gauge emerges naturally as the most convenient .",
    "the convenience is related with the fact that for this gauge the ground state eigenfunction is real . for @xmath120 the azimuthal symmetry",
    "is broken , consequently , the most convenient choice of the gauge to treat the problem is no longer evident .",
    "a question can be posed : in what gauge the ground state eigenfunction is real ?",
    "in such a gauge the trial function for the ground state can be searched among real functions .",
    "this strategy was realized in @xcite .",
    "( [ veff ] ) at @xmath121 . @xmath122 and @xmath123g.,width=432 ]    since we are going to use an approximate method for solving the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ hka ] ) , a quality of the approximation of ground state function can depend on the gauge .",
    "in particular , one can ask whether can one find a gauge for which a given trial function leads to minimal variational energy . such a gauge ( if found ) can be called optimal for a chosen trial function .    to this end , it is convenient to introduce a unitary transformation @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 is a parameter .",
    "the unitary transformed hamiltonian ( [ hka ] ) takes the form @xmath127 this transformation implies that we consider now the schrdinger equation in a linear gauge for which the position of the gauge center , where @xmath128 , is located at @xmath129 .",
    "for @xmath107 we expect the gauge center to be localized on the line @xmath100 , between the origin @xmath130 and the second minimum @xmath131 of @xmath97 , ( see ( [ min ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the vector potential can be considered as a variational function and can be chosen by a procedure of minimization as it was proposed in @xcite ( see also for discussion @xcite ) .",
    "the case @xmath132 has been used in the past to study the so - called centered states with wavefunction peaked at the coulomb minimum @xcite . while for the so - called `` decentered '' states it seems natural to consider @xmath133 . the eigenvalue problem @xmath134 where @xmath135 , is the central object of our study hereafter .",
    "if we put @xmath136 in ( [ hxi ] ) , one can construct the wkb - expansion at large @xmath137 for the phase @xmath48 .",

    "following the prescription formulated in @xcite we construct a trial function for the ground state in a form of linear superposition @xmath153 where @xmath154 are linear variational parameters .",
    "supposedly , they should behave smoothly as a function of a magnetic field .",
    "we carried out a variational study of the two - body neutral system on a plane moving across a magnetic field .",

    "is presented in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the energy grows monotonically and rather sharp as a function of a magnetic field for fixed pseudomomentum but at much slow pace as a function of pseudomomentum for a fixed magnetic field .",
    "it is worth noting that for fixed @xmath0 the energy @xmath157 as a function of @xmath1 tends asymptotically to the ground state energy of two non - interacting charges in a magnetic field .    after making a minimization",
    ", one can see the appearance of a sharp change in behavior of parameters in ( [ interp ] ) as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "it is related with a fact of the existence of a certain critical pseudomomentum @xmath158 such that for @xmath159 the optimal linear parameters @xmath160 the wavefunction has a peak near the coulomb singularity ( centered state ) . at @xmath161",
    "the situation gets opposite : the parameters @xmath162 and the wavefunction is peaked near the second well of ( [ veff ] ) , see fig.[vb1 ] ( we call this well the _",
    "magnetic _ well ) which corresponds to a decentered state .",
    "the existence of such a change in the behavior of parameters results also in a specific behavior of energy dependence ( see for example fig.[e0 ] ) and mean interparticle separation vs the pseudomomentum . from physical point of view at @xmath163 the effective depth of the coulomb well and one of the magnetic well get equal .",
    "if @xmath159 the effective depth of the coulomb well is larger ( or much larger depending on a magnetic field strength ) than one of the magnetic well , the system prefers to stay at the coulomb well .",
    "if @xmath161 the effective depth of the coulomb well is smaller ( or much smaller depending on a magnetic field strength ) than one of the magnetic well , the system prefers to stay at the magnetic well .",
    "for all studied magnetic fields the barrier between wells is very large , the probability of tunneling from one well to another one is very small .",
    "hence , the energy behavior _ vs. _ cms momentum is defined by the behavior in one well or another , it is close to classical behavior . thus , the presence of the second minimum in the effective potential can be neglected .",
    "this phenomenon is very well - pronounced at small magnetic fields .",
    "similar behavior was observed in three - dimensional case in @xcite ( for hydrogen atom ) and @xcite ( for positronium ) .",

    "it is close to 1 , it varies within @xmath169 $ ] for magnetic field range @xmath170a.u .",

    "but it is not a phase transition : the energy changes sharply but smooth . for @xmath163 the parameter @xmath173",
