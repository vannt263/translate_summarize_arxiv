    "another possibility is that the gas dynamics are just beginning to be influenced by the bar or that a stable semi equilibrium has not yet been reached .",

    "to analyze the complex kinematics in the inner 50  pc of ngc  3227 showing clear deviations from pure circular motions we modeled the data with 3drings ( see appendix b ) .",
    "3drings allows to model non - circular motions ( 1 ) via elliptical orbits with changing position angles characterizing gas motions in a bar and ( 2 ) via circular orbits leaving the plane of the galaxy representing a warp .",

    "+ the model subdivides the disk into many individual ( circular or elliptical ) orbits of molecular gas . the inclination",
    ", position angle and shape of the rotation curve for the overall galaxy were held fixed .",

    "the best results for the warp model is consistent with an enclosed mass of 2 @xmath2 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 .",
    "+ the pv - diagrams , the velocity field and the intensity map were used as a guidance during the fitting process . to allow for an easy comparison between the data and the models",

    "all source components in this representation of the data can also be identified in the images at the nominal angular resolution of 0.6  .",
    "elliptical orbits caused by a bar potential are a generally accepted way to explain non - circular but well ordered motion in external galaxies in the presences of a bar potential .",
    "this is the only possibility to describe non - circular planar motion that is stable for several orbital time scales .",
    "however , high angular resolution nir data shows no evidence for a strong nuclear bar ( schinnerer et al .",

    "[ abb15 ] we show the curves for the position angle @xmath25 and an eccentricity @xmath54 that describe the ellipses for our best fit in the framework of the bar approach .",
    "[ abb16 ] shows that we are not able to account for the observed amount of counter rotation along the kinematic major axis and especially along pa  40@xmath6 close to the kinematic minor axis .",
    "also , in all pv - diagrams the s - shape in the inner 1  is not fully reproduced .",
    "however , the model fails completely to reproduce the pv - diagrams close to the kinematic minor axis , especially , the counter rotation observed at @xmath55 0.5  .",
    "also the fit can not explain the second flip with the velocity rising according to the enclosed central mass .",
    "the bar model can not fully reproduce the central 1  intensity map and velocity field ( fig .",
    "[ abb17 ] ) for this bar model",
    ". + comparison to the calculated velocity fields and rotation curves of wozniak & pfenniger ( 1997 ) who used self - consistent models of barred galaxies shows that no strong apparent counter rotation along the minor axis is possible in such a scenario ( their figure 5 ) .",
    "this makes us confident that our bar approach is valid and that the bar scenario is a less likely solution for the central 1  in ngc  3227 .",
    "since the bar approach failed to fully explain the complex but well ordered motion in the inner 1  of ngc  3227 we inspected the second possibility to explain non - circular motion : the warping of the gas disk mimicked by tilting circular orbits out of the plane of the galaxy .",
    "this approach seems reasonable as gas can leave the plane of the galaxy at the position of vertical resonances ( pfenniger 1984 ; combes et al . 1990 ) and therefore probably populate the essential orbits .",
    "as warps have also been observed in accretion disks ( e.g. ngc  4258 by miyoshi et al .",
    "1997 ) this seems a plausible way to pursue .",
    "[ abb19 ] we show the excellent fit of our warp model to the pv - diagrams .",
    "the intensity map and velocity field of this model are shown in fig .",
    "[ abb20 ] .",
    "the remaining differences ( mainly reflecting the uneven intensity distribution in the data ) are mostly due to the assumption of a uniform density distribution .",
    "the @xmath51 curve ( fig . [ abb18 ] ) required to fit the data is remarkably smooth .",

    "pc ( 0.36  ) the warped disk is orthogonal to the host plane in agreement with the disk interpretation in section [ ww24 ] . at smaller",

    "+ the best fits result in @xmath56 with respect to the major axis .",
    "the corresponding @xmath50 is @xmath57",
    ". therefore @xmath110 rotations at @xmath58 are required in order to precess by 360@xmath6 . for @xmath59 an @xmath60 exist such that the resulting solution is identical in its kinematics .",
    "this indicates that there exists a single geometrical solution both with prograde and retrograde precession relative to the rotation of the host galaxy . to fit the counter rotation it is required that @xmath51 rises above 90@xmath6",
    "this is in agreement with pringle ( 1997 ) who has shown that in the case of accretion disks it is possible to obtain a stable warp till tilting angles of 180@xmath6 .",
    "the comparison of both best solutions shows that the warp model is a much better and preferred description of the data .",
    "the greatest shortcoming of the planar bar model is that it fails to reproduce the counter rotation along the minor axis , although the fit is satisfying along the kinematic major axis . as a strong stellar bar",
    "is not observed in the nir ( chapman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and our sharp k - band speckle image reconstructions ) strong streaming motions can not be evoked to explain the remaining differences between the bar model and the data .",
    "these facts combined with the poor fit to the kinematic minor axis @xmath61-diagram and to the observed spectra ( fig . [ abb22 ] ) makes it not straight forward to explain the kinematics in the inner 0.8  with a bar , i.e. via a pure planar system with ordered ( elliptical ) orbits .",
    "therefore our modeling suggest that the molecular nuclear gas disk in ngc  3227 is likely to be warped in the inner 70  pc .",
    "also it is indicated that the gas observed at radii @xmath62 13  pc is relatively uniformly distributed rather than constrained to some distinct areas in the nuclear region .",
    "+   + the warp approach results in a very good fit to the @xmath36 data cube ( see also spectra in fig .",
    "[ abb22 ] ) and therefore we definitely favor this model .",
    "theoretical analyses of the bulge formation and the bar dissolution using orbit calculations or n - body simulations show that with a sufficient central mass density 3-dimensional stellar orbits form that can support and enhance the so - called boxy or peanut appearance of bulges .",
    "the interesting zone is the region where the bar potential is only as strong as the bulge potential of the central mass .",
    "this happens often at about the distance of the radial ilr .",
    "then in addition to the radial ilr a inner vertical resonance ( ivr ) forms which allows stars to leave the plane of the disk ( pfenniger 1984 , combes et al .",
    "friedli & benz ( 1993 ) have shown that even well within the plane of a barred galaxy vertical resonances can be high - lighted by the gas being pushed out of the plane .",
    "since @xmath63 orbits are vertically unstable , the gas can leave the plane very quickly after formation of the bar and becomes trapped in stable anomalous orbits inclined with respect to the major axis @xmath12 ( ano@xmath64 orbits , see pfenniger & friedli 1991 ) .",
    "similarly garcia - burillo et al . ( 1999 ) observe in the warped galaxy ngc  4013 substantial amounts of molecular gas well above the plane . in this case , however , the star formation activity in the disk might be responsible . for ngc  3227 ( and ngc  1068 , schinnerer et al .",
    "1999 ) we find that the gas disk starts to warp at a radius at which the bulge begins to dominate the gravitational potential .",
    "once out of the plane , the gas would be mainly supported by the potential of the bulge , competing with that of the bar or disk . as the gas is dissipative compared to the stars it is valid to assume that it will stay on ordered non - crossing orbits which will strongly favor the formation of warps .",
    "+   + in order to move the gas out of the plane a torque is needed .",
    "torques can be induced by a non - spherical galactic potential ( similar to the effect of the halo on the hi disk ) , by the radiation pressure of the radio jet ( similar to the central radiation source causing the warp in the accretion disk ; pringle 1996 , 1997 ) , by gas pressure in the ionization cone ( quillen & bower 1999 ) or as a transient phenomenon by the gravitational force of a dislocated molecular cloud complex ( see also appendix c for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "estimates of these effects in the nuclear region of ngc  3227 ( see table in appendix ) show that torques induced by gas pressure or gmcs are the two most likely causes . +   +",
    "the only worrying aspect of the warp model is seen in the 3-dimensional view ( see fig .",
    "[ abb21 ] ) .",
    "the direct view onto the agn is seemingly blocked by the warped gas disk .",
    "this is in contradiction to the unified scheme for seyfert galaxies that proposes for seyfert  1 types a clear view to the central engine .",
    "this problem can be softened , if the orbits are not homogeneously filled with molecular gas but rather with molecular clumps smaller than the size of the seyfert  1 nucleus . in this case no effective shadowing of the compact seyfert nucleus itself can occur .",
    "+   + the interpretation of the x - ray data demands a warm absorber which would be located in the immediate vicinity of the agn ( komossa & fink 1997 ) .",
    "recent observations of absorption lines in the uv of seyfert  1 galaxies show that these absorptions occur in galaxies with a warm absorber ( as ngc  3227 ; crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) at larger radial distances than the blr .",
    "+   + the different classifications as a seyfert  2 or seyfert  1 found for ngc  3227 in the literature are most likely caused by variability .",
    "ngc  3227 was first classified as a seyfert  2 by khachikian & weedman ( 1974 ) .",
    "however , from data with higher s / n osterbrock ( 1977 ) identified it as a seyfert 1.2 .",
    "further measurements by heckman et al .",
    "( 1981 ) and peterson et al .",
    "( 1982 ) confirmed this classification . on the other hand schmidt & miller ( 1985 ) note that the general low ( and variable ) strength of the emission line spectrum is in better agreement with a seyfert  2 nucleus .",
    "this indicates that the nucleus of ngc  3227 is either intrinsically relatively weak for a seyfert  1 galaxy or it is weakened by obscuration .",
    "obscuring gas in the warped molecular disk may well be responsible for the observed variability and varying classification of the nuclear source in ngc  3227 .",
    "+   + it is also possible to compare the warp model with results from optical polarimetry .",
    "thompson et al . ( 1980 ) as well as schmidt & miller ( 1985 ) have observed a polarization of about @xmath1 1% for the continuum as well as the permitted and forbidden emission lines of the blr and nlr .",
    "the degree and position angle of the polarization for the continuum and the emission lines are similarly implying a common cause for the polarization .",
    "the position angle ( 131@xmath6@xmath88@xmath6 ) of the polarization is not in agreement with the galactic major axis or the axis of the radio jet but it is in agreement with the apparent enhancement of disk material due to projection effects in the warp geometry as proposed here .",

    "the direct comparison to our high resolution interferometric @xmath0co ( 2 - 1 ) data furthermore suggests that the hcn(1 - 0 ) is mainly arising from a region of size @xmath20 0.6  which shows unusual kinematical behavior .",
