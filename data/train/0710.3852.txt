    "studying strong correlations in lattice fermi gases has now become an emerging forefront of cold atom physics , mainly because of the flexibility of varying interactions and controlling filling number to access various quantum phases .",
    "one major effort pursued in many labs now is to use ultracold fermi gases to simulate hubbard model , which exhibits various metallic , insulating and superconducting phases , with different magnetic behaviors @xcite . despite of huge efforts extending over several decades",
    ", there are still lots of controversial issues on this model , which hopefully cold atom experiments can shed light on .    the most solid conclusion of hubbard model is drawn for a half - filled cubic lattice which says a spin-@xmath3 antiferromagnetic ( af ) order exists for all range of repulsive interaction . for weak interaction , the af order arises from the nesting geometry of fermi surface , while for strong interaction , it is caused by the super - exchange interaction @xcite . observing this af order in cold atom experiments , especially in strong interaction regime ,",
    "is considered as a hallmark of seeing strong correlations in lattice fermi gases and the starting point for more ambitious goals along this direction",
    ".    on the other hand , in optical lattices physics can be much more richer than the single - band hubbard model .",
    "when there are more than two fermions at one lattice site , fermions will start to occupy excited bands like the @xmath0-band .",
    "unlike in condensed matter systems , there is no jahn - teller effect in optical lattices , so the three - fold orbital degeneracy of the @xmath0-band is well maintained .",
    "recently there are increasing theoretical and experimental interests in studying bosons in the @xmath0-band , where a host of intriguing quantum phenomena due to orbital degeneracy has been pointed out @xcite .",
    "we expect the physics of @xmath0-band fermions will be more easier for experimentally study , because the pauli exclusion principle prevents the decay into the lower band .",
    "thanks to the orbital degeneracy , @xmath0-band fermi gases are expected to exhibit more diverse phases comparing to single - band hubbard model . nevertheless , the first step toward revealing these exciting phases is to understand the unfrustrated spin order at half - filling .",
    "here we consider a three - dimensional cubic lattice whose three degenerate p - bands are half filled by three fermions per site .",
    "( the @xmath2-band is already completely filled by another two fermions and do not need to be worried about . )    with the complexity in p - band model , even for half - filling there are issues not clear , for instance ( i ) whether the p - band fermi - surface still has some nesting properties which give rise to a magnetic instability in weak interaction regime ; ( ii ) with multiple hopping channels in different orbitals and multiple choices of intermediate states , whether super - exchange processes can still yield a simple heisenberg - type model as in the s - band situation ; and ( iii ) as there are various types of orders due to orbital degrees of freedom , whether the strong and weak interaction regime share the same order or there is quantum phase transition in between .",
    "these questions will be answered in this work .",
    "the main results of this paper can be summarized as :    ( * i * ) in strong interaction regime , at each isolated site the ground state of three fermions in p - orbitals are spin-@xmath1 states with four - fold degeneracy due to the hund s rule .",
    "the coupling between two neighboring spins is caused by virtual hopping of fermions , which gives rise to an isotropic spin-@xmath1 heisenberg model : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an on - site spin-@xmath1 operator . @xmath6 which means the ground state of this system has spin-@xmath1 antiferromagnetic order .",
    "( * ii * ) in weak interaction regime , the fermi surface of a half - filled @xmath0-band exhibits a perfect nesting symmetry , with the nesting momentum @xmath7 .",
    "mean - field analysis shows this nesting will induce antiferromagnetic order at low - temperature , and the order parameter coincides with the @xmath8 spin order in strong interaction regime .",
    "we also show that this order should be the only order parameter .    based on ( * i * ) and ( * ii * ) , we anticipate that , despite the complexity with p - band orbital degeneracy , the half - filled p - band hubbard model exhibits only the spin-@xmath1 antiferromagnetic order for all range of interaction strength , and the system undergoes a _ crossover _ from weak to strong interaction , a situation similar to the half - filled single - band hubbard model .    in the experiments of cold atoms in optical lattices , the major difficulty in achieving af order in strongly correlated regime comes from the fact that the nel temperature is very low because of the ultra - small energy scale of super - exchange interaction .",
    "in this work we show that in strong interaction regime the nel temperature for @xmath0-band af can reach a few nano - kelvin , which is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of @xmath2-band .",
    "because of this we suggest to study @xmath0-band fermi gas as a more realistic and promising route to reveal strongly correlated physics in optical lattices",
    ".    -band . for a fermion in @xmath9 orbital in @xmath10-site ,",
    "its hopping amplitude to @xmath11 site is @xmath12 , to @xmath13-site and @xmath14 site is @xmath15 , and it can not hop to @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) orbital of its neighboring site .",
    "( b ) illustration of the @xmath0-band fermi surface nesting at half - filling .",
    "red line and blue line are fermi surfaces in @xmath18 plane for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "these two fermi surfaces parallel with the nesting momentum @xmath7(the solid black arrow ) . [ model ] ]",
    "the model for fermi gases in optical lattices contains a nearest neighbor hopping @xmath21 and an on - site interaction @xmath22 .",
    "the hopping term @xmath21 can be written as : @xmath23 since optical lattice is a separable potential in three dimensions ( @xmath24 ) , the hopping term conserves orbital index due to the orthogonality of wannier wave functions , and the hopping amplitude is anisotropic @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "and there is also no next nestest neighbor hopping @xcite .",
    "[ model](a ) is a schematic of hoppings in the @xmath0-band .",
    "@xmath12 is much larger than @xmath27 , for instance , for an optical lattice with the depth @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the photon recoil energy ) , @xmath30 .",
    "for ultra - cold neutral gases , the interaction is dominated by short - range @xmath2-wave repulsion @xmath31 , which takes place between unlike spins only @xcite",
    ". the on - site interaction @xmath22 then has the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath34-orbital wannier wave function .",
    "there are totally four terms due to @xmath2-wave interaction .",
    "the first term is the interaction within the same orbital , the second term is the interaction between unlike orbitals , the third term represents the spin exchange between unlike orbitals and the fourth term represents two fermions hopping processes from one orbital to another .",
    "usually @xmath35 is three times larger than @xmath36 .",
    "when the on - site interaction is dominative , we shall first ignore the hopping term and calculate all the eigenstates of an isolated site .",
    "the results for three , four and two fermions per site are summarized in following table [ n3 ] , [ n4 ] and [ n2 ] .",
    "as one can see from table [ n3 ] , the low - energy hilbert space is constituted by four spin-@xmath1 states .",
    "because these spin states are symmetric superpositions of three atoms , their spatial wave functions have to be antisymmetric and the interactions are completely quenched . in this limit ,",
    "the system is a spin-3/2 mott insulator @xcite .",
    ".eigenstates and eigenenergies of three fermions at an isolated site . in these three tables",
    ", we define that , for example , @xmath37 means @xmath38 is double - occupied , @xmath39 is occupied by a spin-@xmath40 fermion , and @xmath41 is empty .",
    "[ n3 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ default ]    the coupling of spins between neighboring sites can be obtained by taking the hopping term as the second - order perturbation with the brillioun - wigner approximation@xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 means the projection into excited hilbert space , and @xmath44 means the projection into @xmath8 hilbert space . to proceed we make following observations :",
    "( i ) the virtual hopping processes only take place within the same orbital , otherwise the final state will have double occupancy , which should be projected out .",
    "for instance , if a @xmath38 fermion hops from @xmath10-site to @xmath45-site , it must be followed by a @xmath38 fermion hops from @xmath45-site to @xmath10-site .",
    "( ii ) by using table [ n3 ] , [ n4 ] and [ n2 ] one can show that only one type of excited states can be connected to the unperturbed ground states via hopping , which is the lowest energy states of four fermions ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) in one site and the lowest energy states of two fermions ( @xmath46 and @xmath48 ) in its neighborhood @xcite .",
    "so the intermediate states always has energy @xmath49 .",
    "because of ( i - ii ) , @xmath50 on the link between @xmath10 and @xmath11 site reads @xmath51 note that @xmath52 where @xmath53 and with the help of table [ n3 ] , one can show that @xmath54 then @xmath55 on this link can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 we now introduce @xmath5 as @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the pauli matrices . restricted in the low - energy hilbert space , @xmath5 acts as @xmath8 spin operator .",
    "hence , we have shown the first main result that",
    "in this regime we use usual hartree - fock mean - field theory , for which the hamiltonian is rewritten into momentum space .",
    "the hopping term can be written as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 for half - filling , @xmath62 , and the fermi surface for one of the @xmath0-bands is plotted in fig .",
    "[ model](b ) .    for performing mean - field decomposition , we reconstruct the interaction term @xmath22 as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 . here",
    "we introduce @xmath67 and @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the spin lifting operator . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ model](b ) , each of three @xmath0-band fermi - surfaces exhibits nesting symmetry with the nesting momentum @xmath7 at half - filling .",
    "it means that for each @xmath70 at fermi surface , @xmath71 also locates at fermi surface , therefore , the maximum contribution to @xmath72 comes from @xmath73 . for this reason we only consider @xmath74 component in the mean - field approximation , and we introduce three order parameters which are @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are independent of index @xmath80 , @xmath81 because of the permutation symmetry between orbitals .",
    "note that @xmath82 is the same spin order as in strong interaction regime , we separate the mean - field hamiltonian into two parts as @xmath83 where @xmath84+\\frac{\\delta^2}{v_1}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath85+\\frac{\\gamma^2}{v_2}+\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2w}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath86 does not contain @xmath87-terms because they all cancel out due to the permutation symmetry of three orbitals , therefore @xmath88 .    because the three orbitals are now separable in @xmath89 , it can be easily diagnolized by bogoliubov transformation @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are quasi - particle operators@xcite .",
    "the equation for @xmath82 is @xmath94 the solution of which yields non - zero value of @xmath82 and the critical temperature for having non - zero @xmath82 .",
    "next we shall examine whether there will be symmetry breaking of @xmath79 also , for which we treat @xmath86 as perturbation on top of @xmath95 , and the energy can be expanded in powers of @xmath79 as @xmath96 .",
    "so whether there is an instability for developing finite @xmath79 depends on the sign of @xmath97 .",
    "straightforward calculation shows that @xmath98 where @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "we numerically compute eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) and find that it is always positive , which indicates that there will be no symmetry breaking of @xmath79 .",
    "mathematically , it is because @xmath100 except for a few specific points in momentum space . in the limit of @xmath101 , the first term in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) diverges only around those a few points , while the second term diverges around the whole fermi surface , hence the second term will always be dominative and the whole summation is positive . physically , it is because the af instability crucially relies on the nesting of fermi surface , and the fact that there is no nesting between two different @xmath0-bands prevents inter - orbital spin order .",
    "hence we have reached the second main result that",
    "here we first calculate the wannier functions in an optical lattice potential and use them to deduce the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath27 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 in our model .",
    "then , we calculate the nel temperature given by heisenberg model of eq.([hm ] ) @xmath102 , which is @xmath103,@xcite and also calculate @xmath104 given by mean - field theory by solving equation ( [ mf ] ) for the onset of non - zero @xmath82 .",
    "we display our calculation of these two @xmath105 for both half - filled @xmath0-band and @xmath2-band in fig .",
    "@xmath102 decreases as the increase of the lattice height while @xmath104 increases as the increase of the lattice height .     as a function of optical lattice depth @xmath106 .",
    "four curves are @xmath0-band @xmath105 from heisenberg model @xmath107 , from mean - field theory @xmath108 ; @xmath2-band @xmath105 from heisenberg model @xmath109 , from mean - field theory @xmath110 , respectively . for parameters ,",
    "we use @xmath111 in optical lattices as an example @xcite . the lattice spacing @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the energy units is taken as @xmath115 , which corresponds to @xmath116.[tc ] ]    for small @xmath106 , @xmath117 , the af order is caused by mean - field effect , while for large @xmath106 where @xmath118 , the af order is driven by super - exchange processes and the system is in strongly correlated regime .",
    "the regime where @xmath119 and @xmath120 cross is the crossover regime from weak to strong interactions , where both two methods will fail , and more advanced numerical technique like dmft and qmc is required in order to give accurate nel temperature @xcite .",
    "we will leave this for further investigation . however , the key point is that the s - band @xmath120 is already of the order of @xmath121 when the lattice height enters the strongly correlated regime of great experimental interests , and it decreases to below @xmath122 rapidly as @xmath106 increases , while the p - band @xmath120 remains the order of @xmath123 even when @xmath106 increases to @xmath124 .",
    "it is simply because the wannier wave function in @xmath0-band is much more extended , its hopping amplitude @xmath12 is one to two orders larger than that of @xmath2-band , which consequently leads to much larger @xmath125 .    in additional to higher nel temperature , the spin-@xmath1 of @xmath0-band af state could have a better signal - to - noise radio than @xmath2-band spin-@xmath3 af .",
    "all these provide great advantage for experimental study of quantum af and its related phenomena due to super - exchange . besides , we leave the effect of trapping potential to future investigation which may introduce shell structure in density profile and the finite size effect into the problem .",
