    "the topology of iterated loop spaces was thoroughly investigated in the seventies @xcite .",
    "these spaces have a wealth of homology operations parametrised by the famous operads of little discs .",
    "the notion of operad was introduced for the first time for this purpose @xcite .",
    "such machinery allows for example to reconstruct an iterated delooping if one has full knowledge of the operad action on an iterated loop space .",
    "moreover any connected space acted on by the little discs is homotopy equivalent to an iterated loop space .",
    "this fact is the celebrated recognition principle .",
    "our main objective is to extend this theory by adding the operations _ rotating _ the discs .",
    "the operad generated by the little @xmath0-discs @xmath5 and the rotations in @xmath2 is called the framed @xmath0-discs operad , and was introduced in @xcite . our equivariant recognition principle (",
    "theorem [ the ] ) says that a connected ( or grouplike ) space acted on by the framed @xmath0-discs operad is weakly homotopic to the @xmath0-fold loop space on an @xmath2-space .",
    "thus the looping and delooping functors induce a categorical equivalence between @xmath2-spaces and spaces acted on by the framed @xmath0-discs operad , under the correct connectivity assumptions .",
    "the main technique consists in presenting the framed little discs as a semidirect product of the little discs and the special orthogonal group , so that an algebra over the framed @xmath0-discs is nothing else than an algebra over the original little @xmath0-discs _ in the category of @xmath2-spaces _ .",

    "if @xmath7 is trivial we recover the original recognition principle by may .",
    "is there a way of producing spaces acted on by the framed discs operad from category theory ?",
    "fiedorowicz showed that the nerve of a braided monoidal category is equivalent to an algebra over the little 2-discs @xcite .",
    "we extend this fact to ribbon braided monoidal categories , which are braided categories equipped with a `` twist '' , and the framed little 2-discs operad ( theorem [ ribbonthm ] ) .",
    "is there a procedure to detect framed little 2-discs operad up to homotopy ?",
    "fiedorowicz @xcite has a procedure to recognise topological operads weakly equivalent to the little 2-discs .",
    "we extend his work to the twisted case giving a procedure to detect whether an operad is weakly equivalent to the framed 2-discs ( theorem [ fe2 ] ) .",

    ", we define the semidirect product operad of a hopf algebra @xmath8 and an operad acted on by @xmath8 .",
    "an algebra over the semidirect product will be exactly an algebra over the original operad _ in the monoidal category of @xmath8-modules_. the homology functor with coefficients in a field commutes with the semidirect product construction .",
    "this approach yields a conceptual proof that the rational homology of an algebra over the framed 2-discs is a batalin - vilkovisky algebra @xcite , and computes more generally the rational homology of the framed @xmath0-discs operad for any @xmath0 ( theorem [ bvn ] ) .    what is the dual of a semidirect product operad of chain complexes ?",
    "we redefine the concept of koszul duality for semidirect products , in contrast to @xcite , so that the dual is still naturally a semidirect product .",
    "this notion induces equivalence of derived categories over dual operads .",
    "moreover a koszul operad remains such after taking semidirect products .",
    "for example the bv - operad is koszul self - dual up to a shift .",
    "this is based upon the analogous result for gerstenhaber algebras @xcite .    as application",
